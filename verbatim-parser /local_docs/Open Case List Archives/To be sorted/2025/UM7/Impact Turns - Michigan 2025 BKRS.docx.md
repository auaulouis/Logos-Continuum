## Appeasement Good

### Appeasement Good \-\-- Inherency \-\-- 2AC

#### Squo prevents appeasement---U.S. military overextension antagonizes Russia and blocks diplomacy; pulling back enables engagement and de-escalation.

Priorities, "Aligning Global Military Posture with U.S. Interests,"
<https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/aligning-global-military-posture-with-us-interests/>\]

The Pentagon [should [revise]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[U.S]{.mark}.
global [military posture]{.mark}]{.underline} to be [[consistent]{.mark}
with **[protecting]{.mark} vital national
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} based on a grand strategy of
**[[realism and restraint]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This will mean
[[reducing]{.mark} the [size]{.mark} of the [military footprint]{.mark}
in certain regions]{.underline} and [[changing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[mix and location of military [forces]{.mark}]{.underline} in others.

A review of the U.S. global military posture should [[focus]{.mark} on
[four priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[defending]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[homeland]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[preventing]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[rise]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[rival regional
[hegemon]{.mark}]{.underline}** in key areas, [[burden shifting]{.mark}
to [allies]{.mark} and [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[[protecting]{.mark} U.S. [economic]{.mark}]{.underline} security.

The [current military [posture]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe is too
[[large]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[encouraging free-riding by European
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and preventing them from taking more
responsibility for their own security. [U.S. [troop levels
should]{.mark} be [reduced]{.mark}]{.underline} to approximately where
they were before Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine. This [will involve
the [withdrawal]{.mark} of some ground combat
[units]{.mark}]{.underline}, multiple fighter squadrons, and several
destroyers.

### Appeasement Good \-\-- Polar Council \-\-- 2AC

#### Appeasement prevents worse alternatives---without US cooperation, Russia builds exclusionary "Polar Council" that sidelines the West and fractures Arctic unity.

Russia's ambitions in the Arctic,"
<https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-bear-beneath-the-ice-russias-ambitions-in-the-arctic/>\]

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rupture]{.mark} in relations
[following]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's full-scale [[invasion]{.mark}
of Ukraine]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the [near collapse of
the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}, it [remains in [Europeans'
interest]{.mark} to [preserve]{.mark}]{.underline} a [functional
[channel]{.mark} of [comm]{.mark}unication with [Russia
through]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[council]{.mark} to help
**[prevent]{.mark} its [withdrawal]{.mark}.**]{.underline} With the
Kingdom of [[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark} taking over the chairship in
May 2025, it [should [aim]{.mark} to [replicate
Norway's]{.mark}]{.underline} **[cautious strategy]{.underline}**:
[[keep]{.mark}ing Russia [engaged in select]{.mark}ed [formats]{.mark}
**without full normalisation** [until]{.mark} the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark} is [over]{.mark}.]{.underline} And, given Moscow's
appointment of Nikolai Korchunov as its ambassador in Oslo, Norway is
well placed to play an intermediary role between Russia and Europe on
Arctic policy.

More importantly, some [[engagement with Russia]{.mark} in]{.underline}
the [Arctic [Council]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[dissuade
Washington]{.mark} from [establishing]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[parallel]{.mark}]{.underline} bilateral [Arctic [track]{.mark} with
[Moscow or allowing]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**temporary [US-Russia
thaw]{.mark}** [under Trump]{.mark} to take]{.underline} institutional
[form.]{.underline} If [[such]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[channel]{.underline}]{.mark} materialised, it [could
**[strengthen]{.mark} Moscow's [efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
[[build]{.underline}]{.mark} a real [["Polar Council"]{.mark} that
[includes non-West]{.mark}ern states [and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} and
[excludes Europe]{.mark}an countries and [Canada]{.mark}]{.underline},
turning a Potemkin construct into a viable alternative. Such a
[[deal]{.underline}]{.mark}---[driven by]{.underline} the **[imperial
ambitions]{.underline}** of both Washington and Moscow---would [further
**[erode]{.mark} Europe's [influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
region and [**[undermine]{.mark} the [cohesion]{.mark}** of [Western
Arctic strategy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Appeasement Good \-\-- ??

#### Appeasement is typically undervalued due to flawed history \-\-- misapplied lessons of Munich overlook successful appeasement scenarios.

**Walt '24** \[Stephen; April 29; columnist at Foreign Policy and the
Robert and Renee Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard
University; Foreign Policy, "Appeseament is Underrated,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/04/29/appeasement-is-underrated/>\]

For starters, [[those]{.mark} who [invoke Munich rarely understand
**what really took place**]{.mark}]{.underline} back in 1938. Contrary
to the subsequent mythology, [[Chamberlain]{.mark} was [neither
naive]{.mark} about Hitler [nor unaware]{.mark} of]{.underline} the
[dangers]{.underline} posed by Nazi Germany. Among other things, he
backed Britain's efforts to rearm during the latter half of the 1930s.
[He did not think Britain was ready for war]{.underline}, however, and
[[saw]{.underline}]{.mark} an [agreement at [Munich as]{.mark} a way
to [buy time]{.mark}]{.underline} for British rearmament to proceed. He
hoped that the deal reached at Munich would satisfy Hitler and ensure
peace in Europe, but if it didn't work, Britain (and France) would be in
a better position to fight when war eventually came.

He was correct: Britain and France had larger forces in the field than
Germany did by the spring of 1940, and their rapid and
unexpected defeat in the Battle of the Low Countries was due to
failuresof strategy and intelligence, not a lack of tanks, troops, or
aircraft.

Furthermore, [[taking]{.mark} a [harder line]{.mark} in 1938 [would
**not have stopped**]{.mark} Hitler from starting the
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}. We now know that
[[Hitler]{.underline}]{.mark} himself [was]{.underline} deeply
[[disappointed by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [outcome at
[Munich]{.mark}]{.underline}, as he had been
[[hoping]{.underline}]{.mark} for a [[casus belli]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [[Chamberlain's diplomacy denied]{.mark} him the
opportunity]{.underline} that he craved to crush Czechoslovakia
militarily. German officers opposed to the invasion might have ousted
Hitler had he ordered an attack, but there is **[[no
guarantee]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [such a [plot]{.mark} would have
[succeeded]{.mark}]{.underline} even if it had been tried. The
uncomfortable truth is that [[Hitler]{.mark} was [bent]{.mark} on going
to [war]{.mark} sooner or later]{.underline}, and a different outcome in
1938 [**would [not]{.mark} have [prevented]{.mark}** [World War
II]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Second, the enduring [[obsession]{.mark} with [Munich]{.mark} places
[far too much]{.mark} weight on **[one individual
event]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and it [[treats]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[compromises]{.mark} and agreements that]{.underline} have
[occurred]{.underline} between [major powers [as]{.mark} essentially
[irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to imagine a dumber way to
use history: treating one episode as universally valid and studiously
[[ignoring events]{.mark} that **[tell a different
story]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If you happened to have [one tainted meal
at a Chinese restaurant]{.underline}, you'd be **[foolish to conclude
that all Chinese restaurants were bad]{.underline}** and resolve never
to eat in one again. But [that's how leaders and pundits use
Munich]{.underline}, as if its lessons are the only ones that history
provides.

To be more specific, [repeatedly [harping on Munich]{.mark}]{.underline}
conveniently [[discards]{.underline}]{.mark} all the
[[occasions]{.underline}]{.mark} when [great [powers made]{.mark}
themselves [more secure without war]{.mark} by reaching mutually
beneficial [accommodations]{.mark} with a [rival]{.mark}.]{.underline}
We tend to [[overlook]{.underline}]{.mark} the [successful
examples]{.underline} of accommodation [[because **when the results are
unremarkable, life goes on**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and there [isn't a
big war to grab our attention]{.underline}. Yet "nonevents" of this kind
[can be just as informative as]{.underline} the more dramatic situations
where states failed to resolve their differences and went to
[war]{.underline} instead.

Looking for some [[examples]{.mark} of [successful
appeasement]{.mark}]{.underline}? How about the [1955 **[Austrian State
Treaty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which [[removed Soviet troops]{.mark}
from that country in [exchange]{.mark} for]{.underline} a declaration of
[[neutrality]{.underline}]{.mark}? Or consider the [[various arms
control treaties]{.mark} negotiated between the United States and the
Soviet Union]{.underline}, which [helped [stabilize the arms
race]{.mark} and make **[nuclear war less likely]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
U.S. President J[ohn F. [Kennedy]{.mark} [appeased]{.mark}]{.underline}
Soviet leader [Nikita [Khrushchev]{.mark}]{.underline} when he agreed to
[[remove Jupiter missiles]{.mark} in [Turkey]{.mark} in
[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline} for Khrushchev [[withdrawing the
nuclear-armed missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} he had tried to install [in
[Cuba]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [we]{.underline} [may]{.mark} all be
[**[alive today because Kennedy acted as he did]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
U.S. President [Richard [Nixon]{.mark}]{.underline} [and then-National
Security Advisor Henry Kissinger]{.underline} did [something
[similar]{.mark}]{.underline} when they agreed to the [["One China"
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} with [Maoist China]{.underline}---a move
that [[improved]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U.S. position]{.mark} in the
Cold War---[**even though** Mao]{.mark} Zedong was a [ruthless
autocrat]{.mark} who was responsible for the deaths of
millions.]{.underline}

#### Viewing appeasement as a rational policy-making avoids escalation and improves strategic decision-making over flawed history.

[Due to]{.underline} a longstanding and [[historically informed]{.mark}
bias]{.underline}, [[appeasement]{.underline}]{.mark} is a largely
**[underestimated, underused and [misunderstood]{.mark}]{.underline}**
foreign policy [[tool]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[grand
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The '[[Munich]{.underline}]{.mark}
Lesson' has [[perpetuated]{.underline}]{.mark} the [definition of
[appeasement as]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[unilat]{.underline}]{.mark}eral
[act of [accession]{.mark}]{.underline}, which serves only to strengthen
an opponent without returns. This [operates on traditional realist
assumptions of power]{.underline}: concessions strengthen a rival state
and embolden it to make further demands with greater leverage. This
exacerbates the power disparity in the relationship and can cascade into
the rise of an expansionist state. [Empirical cases of appeasement are
labeled as such only when]{.underline} they [match]{.underline} this
[traditional understanding]{.underline}, perpetuating the myth of
appeasement as a pre-determined failed policy. Samuel Azubuike
summarizes the recent history of attitudes towards appeasement:
"[appeasement has [undergone]{.mark} a [rapid metamorphosis from]{.mark}
the [positive]{.mark}, pragmatic and principled [to]{.mark} the
[negative]{.mark} and
pejorative]{.underline}\...[policymakers]{.underline} \[who\]
[[persist]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[using]{.mark} the **[Munich-tainted
definition]{.mark}** of appeasement]{.underline}\... cite the 'lessons
of the past' to justify, advocate, diagnose and facilitate decisions and
preferred policies\..."1 This [[approach fails]{.underline}]{.mark} to
add nuance to the [[conceptual understanding]{.mark} of
[appeasement]{.mark}]{.underline} and it is inherently exclusive to a
number of historical cases that should be labeled as such. By expanding
the definition of appeasement to that of a [calculated policy and grand
strategy choice]{.underline}, several [[more empirical cases]{.mark} are
**[evident]{.mark} throughout history**]{.underline}. This could be done
from a traditional realist, liberal or other perspective in terms of
order of preferences however these theories lack the nuance in their
starting assumptions and logical models or concepts to make a convincing
case Traditional theory and revisionism both have failed to redefine the
term by offering a coherent interpretation or model of what the concept
and the policy of appeasement really are or should be.2 However, a
neoclassical realist perspective takes into account both domestic
resources and the international systemic environment in explaining the
choice to appease and provides a stronger theoretical premise on which
to demonstrate that appeasement can be an [[intelligent]{.mark} and
[successful]{.mark} policy [choice]{.mark} for states given the
appropriate context]{.underline}. [[Providing]{.mark} an [alternative
discourse on appeasement]{.mark} is [needed]{.mark} to [counter]{.mark}
the monotone narrative on appeasement]{.underline} among politicians,
the public and the media. This is particularly important as the
international political community faces an increasing array of
protracted conflicts, pervasive threats and new security challenges.
Appeasement has [been described variously as 'synonymous with weakness
or cowardice]{.underline}, a corrupted policy of compromise, and a
policy which results from 'weakness or ignorance," and as such
[[policy-makers]{.mark}]{.underline} naturally [try to [distance
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} from the term or avoid the policy.3 This
[attitude [restricts]{.mark} policy-makers from
[considering]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[useful]{.mark} grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}** in order to achieve their objectives.
For the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} in particular, as
it grapples with nuclear threats from North Korea, ongoing wars from the
beginning of the 21st century and the resource draining fight against
ISIS, the [[need]{.mark} to [prioritize]{.mark} among [threats]{.mark}
and challenges is critical.]{.underline} The immediate [[dismissal of
appeasement]{.underline}]{.mark} is an [[obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark}
to the [**[needed quality of evaluation]{.mark}** in decision-making
processes.]{.underline} This bias paired with decades of hostility have
been the basis of unfounded claims of enabling Iran to become a nuclear
power without critically engaging with the facts. This thesis will
deconstruct the theoretical bias against appeasement and subsequently
the practical bias against appeasement as it applies to Iran, and make
policy recommendations to optimizing the outcome of the JCPOA.
Literature Review and Theoretical Foundation [[Much]{.underline}]{.mark}
has been [[written]{.mark} about]{.underline} the policy of
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [process of [committing]{.mark}
to a [punishment]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to prevent an attack or
other unwanted action from others. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} in
suciently rich environments in which attacks may evolve over time in
size and scope, [[formulating]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[strategy]{.mark}
[fundamentally involves]{.mark} **not only deterrence**]{.underline} but
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} the act of
[[appeasement]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[**less costly**
process]{.underline}]{.mark} of not responding to an attack. Relatively
less has been written on models that include both deterrence and
appeasement. This paper develops a [model that [integrate]{.mark}s
[the]{.mark}se [two]{.mark} processes]{.underline} to
[[analyze]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[equilibrium]{.underline}]{.mark}
time paths of attacks, punishment, and appeasement. We [[create]{.mark}
an [environment]{.mark} that is **[relevant]{.mark} for [analyzing
attacks]{.mark}** by a challenger [that evolve over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which an initial, [relatively small attack
is launched, followed by subsequent attacks that are larger, [such as
**Russia\'s invasion of Urkaine**]{.mark} following its invasion of
Crimea]{.underline}, and Germany\'s invasion of Poland, following its
invasion of Czechoslovakia. We call the [initial attacks probative
attacks]{.underline}, in which an [attacker]{.underline} rst
[launches]{.underline} a relatively [small attack]{.underline} that can
[reveal info]{.underline}rmation about the incumbent\'s strength. A
potential [second attack, which is larger,]{.underline} and which we
call a [primary attack]{.underline}, may be [launched after]{.underline}
the probative attack. We [embed]{.underline} these [two [types of
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} in a **[[two-stage
game]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which a small (probative) attack can
occur in the rst stage and is potentially followed by a larger (primary)
attack in the second stage. The Incumbent - the Western Alliance, for
example can be either a weak or a strong type as measured by the cost of
punishing the Challenger. A key element of our model is that the
intention of the challenger is uncertain and that it can be revealed
over time. It therefore will be informationally advantageous to delay
punishment of a probative attack until the second stage, at which time
the incumbent can make a better-informed decision on whether to punish.
Prior to the rst stage the incumbent makes a commitment to punishing
either the probative attack, the primary attack, both attacks, or
neither of the attacks. To capture the impact of possible changes in
political preferences over time, we model this commitment to punish as
one that can be revoked at a cost to the incumbent. We report two main
ndings that provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the
process of punishment and appeasement, and how these choices relate to
understanding strong and weak incumbents. Absent the need to signal
intentions, we nd there is a pooling equilibrium in which it is always
[[better]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[appease]{.mark} the
[challenger]{.mark}]{.underline} in the [sense of **[delaying
punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the rst stage until after the
second stage. In the pooling equilibrium, **[[appeasement is a signal of
strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**, See, [for example, Schelling (1960),
Kahn (1960) and Fearon (2018).]{.underline} thus turning on its head the
conventional view that appeasing an invader is a sign of weakness that
invites subsequent attacks.

### Appeasement Good \-\-- AT: Trump

#### Even if Trump seemed completely pro-Russia appeasement, policy ALSO constrained influence and strength.

US-Russia relations became more antagonistic as well, yet with a marked
difference: Though the administration identified Russia and China as
revisionists the US had to stand up to, China was considered the prime
challenge. While policies toward Russia also reflected a newfound
willingness to confront the Kremlin, the situation in Eastern Europe was
interpreted as a second-order problem---one Europeans should do more
about on their own. [[Irrespective of]{.mark} Trump's disconcertingly
[flattering language]{.mark} for Putin]{.underline} (like at the 2018
Helsinki summit, where he gave Putin a public vote of confidence and
contradicted his own intelligence community on Russian election
meddling), [[America]{.mark}n policies [made life harder for
Russia.]{.mark} Washington [provided]{.mark} **lethal [weapons]{.mark}**
to [Ukraine]{.mark}, [increased]{.mark} its **[support]{.mark} to
[NATO]{.mark}**, and [reduced Russian]{.mark} and Iranian
[leeway]{.mark} in the Middle East. In short, [while]{.mark} President
[Trump]{.mark} may have [appeased Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} and China
[[**rhetorically**, the US **re-postured to contain**]{.underline}

#### With the expiration of the START treaty on arms control, mutual restraint proves best at mitigating risks and starting new necessary treaties.

**Courtney '25**\[William; April 15; Professor of Policy Analysis at
RAND School of Public Policy; RAND, "Averting Unconstrained Nuclear
Risks with Russia,"
<https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/04/averting-unconstrained-nuclear-risks-with-russia.html>\]

The [[New START Treaty]{.mark}, a [nuclear]{.mark} arms reduction
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, will [**[expire]{.mark} next
[February]{.mark}**, [ending limits]{.mark} on [U.S. and Russian
long-range nuclear forces]{.mark}. [Negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline} on
a new treaty **[have [not begun]{.mark}]{.underline}** and may take
years. In the interim, nuclear risks might be [[contained if]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and [Russia]{.mark} do [not]{.mark}
[undercut]{.mark} New START [limits]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hardline rule
in Russia and the nuclear buildup in China, however, could impede
restraint.

President Barack Obama negotiated New START, a successor to President
Ronald Reagan\'s 1994 START I Treaty. START I cut long-range, or
strategic, nuclear arsenals by 30--40 percent. New START slashed
accountable deployed strategic arms by another three-quarters. In 2021,
Presidents Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin extended New START until next
February.

[[After]{.mark} its full-scale [invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine, however,
**[Russia suspended participation]{.mark}** in New START. Moscow [no
longer exchanges data]{.mark}, provides [notif]{.mark}ication[s]{.mark},
or allows onsite [inspections]{.mark}, thereby **[weakening
verification]{.mark} and confidence.**]{.underline}

New START does not provide for another extension, and a new treaty may
be delayed. START I negotiations stretched over nine years.

New START does not provide for another extension, and a new treaty may
be delayed. START I negotiations stretched over nine years.

Other considerations might slow the conclusion of a new treaty.

The ex-KGB cohort in Russia\'s Kremlin may resist transparency. START I
defined a new, intrusive verification system. But if, as some urge, a
new treaty is to encompass hard-to-detect nonstrategic (PDF) (tactical)
nuclear arms, even more intrusive verification may be in order. Further,
Russia might oppose ceding some of its large advantage in tactical
nuclear weapons.

Second, if, as some urge, China joins the talks on a new treaty, this
may be a barrier. At present, China shows no interest in negotiations.
As its nuclear buildup (PDF) continues and if parity with Russia and the
United States is achieved, China could become more open to arms control.

Third, the United States might seek an expanded nuclear force to deter
the combined forces of Russia and China. In 2023, A congressional
commission (PDF) saw an "urgent" need for the United States to rebuild
nuclear infrastructure and modernize U.S. nuclear forces.

A fourth potential obstacle is that [[Russia]{.mark} might
[attempt]{.mark} to [link]{.mark} arms control [to other issues,]{.mark}
such as **[Western support for Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
would be a nonstarter.

In sum, a new treaty is unlikely to be ready when New START expires.
What might the United States do in the interim?

In the 1980\'s, [President Ronald [Reagan faced a similar
question]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even though he had called the unratified
SALT II Treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter "fatally flawed,"
[Reagan [pledged]{.mark} that the United States "[would not
undercut]{.mark}" its [limits]{.mark}.]{.underline} He
[[conditioned]{.mark} this [on]{.mark} the [USSR]{.mark}\'s "exercising
equal [restraint]{.mark}" and "actively pursuing" arms cuts in Geneva
talks.]{.underline} To keep the United States within SALT II limits,
[Reagan agreed to dismantle two older Poseidon ballistic missile
submarines.]{.underline}

Why [did [Reagan pursue restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}? He may have
thought many Americans, some influenced by "nuclear freeze" protests,
would see restraint [as [stabilizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. He might also
have [c[alculated]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [restraint]{.mark} would
[help]{.mark} sustain political support for modernizing the U.S. nuclear
arsenal.]{.underline}

Some current circumstances, however, differ from those in the Reagan
era.

Beholden to ultranationalist backing for the war on Ukraine, Putin might
be wary of cozying up to the United States on arms control.

In the mid-1980s, prospects for arms control brightened when a
liberalizing Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power. He and
Reagan reached the historic Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty,
eliminating a whole class of nuclear arms. Today\'s Kremlin leader,
President Vladimir Putin, seems to revel in spouting irresponsible
nuclear threats. Beholden to ultranationalist backing for the war on
Ukraine, Putin might be wary of cozying up to the United States on arms
control.

A second difference is that SALT II verification was largely unilateral,
relying on satellite monitoring of missile silos, bombers, and
submarines. New START also limits less visible warheads, making onsite
inspection valuable. On the other hand, remote monitoring is now far
more advanced.

[[Looking to]{.mark} the [expiration of]{.mark} New [START]{.mark}, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could pursue an interim regime]{.mark}
of **[mutual restraint with Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As in the
1980s, this could reassure publics and allies. If, however, risks of
verification, noncompliance, and China\'s buildup were to weaken the
regime, the United States could [take steps to [mitigate
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States might add nuclear warheads
to some U.S. missiles or bombers. Or it might bolster the ongoing
nuclear modernization program, which includes Columbia-class ballistic
missile submarines, land-based Sentinel missiles, and stealthy B-21

#### Appeasement creates a peaceful landscape. Empirics prove.

[It has been posited that [appeasement serves as a strategy]{.mark} for
intermediate countries [to avert wars and conflicts among the Great
countries]{.mark}. Some contend that [the contemporary landscape]{.mark}
of interconnectedness and obligations within international institutions
[may provide a **conducive atmosphere for appeasement**
methods]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nevertheless, we are currently observing
Great Powers withdrawing from transnational entities such as the EU,
which may potentially be forsaken by the Axis of Germany and France
within the next five to ten years.11 The initial action that Great
Powers are likely to undertake is the termination of their membership in
pacifist international organizations and other bodies that constrain
their sovereignty. Great Powers inside such groupings do not collaborate
to subdue another Great Power. This endeavor is typically executed by
intermediate powers. [Nonetheless, it is not comprehended that
**[appeasement]{.mark}** does not [**yield peace** by conciliating Great
Powers. It is employed to subjugate middle powers, integrating them into
their sphere of influence and securing their
allegiance]{.mark}.]{.underline} This illustrates the validation of
scientific realism, wherein Walz's anarchy dominates if governments fail
to adequately protect themselves in the international sphere.12
[[Appeasement is effective]{.mark} solely [among Great Powers and their
allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} The instances in which a middle power was
co-opted by a Great Power represent, at best, a premature and civilized
\"capitulation\" to the Great Power, [[exemplified by the **Netherlands,
Scandinavia, and Turkey during World War II.**]{.mark}13]{.underline}

Third, my analysis concerns the strategic dilemma for states facing
multiple potential challenges+ [Two recent articles show [it can be
rational to appease when there is]{.mark} only one [potential]{.mark}
[challeng]{.mark}er+ [Hirshleifer argues]{.mark} that [appeasement can
be effective if aggression is an inferior good for the opponent
state]{.mark}, so the opponent's demand for it drops as that state is
bought off+ 9 [Powell]{.mark} [presents an argument based on]{.mark}
asymmetric information+ 10 [A declining state faces a challenger with
unclear aims]{.mark}]{.underline}+ If the challenger's aims are
unlimited, the first state would prefer to fight---and fight as soon as
possible+ There is a strategic cost to delay+ However, if the
challenger's aims are limited, the first state would prefer to appease+
In equilibrium, the state trades off the loss of strategic advantage
against the chance of acquiring information about its adversary's
objectives. [[Both]{.mark} these articles [make]{.mark} compelling
[points about how appeasement can be rational in isolated
interactions]{.mark}]{.underline}. But they do not address the arguments
about reputation and deterrence that inform most critiques of
appeasement+ When there is only one challenger, such questions cannot
arise---there is no one to deter+ An isolated domino cannot start a
cascade+ If the Hirshleifer or Powell models were adapted to include
many potential challengers, appeasement would---by the usual chain-store
logic---erode the appeaser's reputation for resolve and provoke
challenges, even if aggression were an inferior good or the first
challenger had clearly limited aims+ By contrast, I show how, given
resource constraints, appeasement can be rational for states facing
multiple potential challengers where questions of reputation are
critical+ 11 Because state leaders do usually face multiple threats and
worry about international reputation and deterrence, this renders the
model broadly relevant Rational deterrence theory---and the presumption
that states must always fight to preserve reputation---has come under
more fundamental criticism in recent decades+ Empirically, scholars have
found only sketchy evidence that states that fail to fight challenges
are judged irresolute+ Backing out of confrontations, averting one's
eyes, and offering secret concessions have been common practices of all
the great powers+ Reputations appear far more context-dependent and
resilient than the standard models suggest+ 12 One response has been to
reject the rationalistic assumptions of deterrence models and explain
behavior as the result of cognitive biases+ 13 While such biases may
indeed exist, the approach in this article is less radical+ I show that
minor modifications of current rational reputation models can render
them substantially more realistic and convincing+ 14 Many points that
classical deterrence theorists are criticized for neglecting can be
incorporated quite naturally+ In fact, once resource constraints are
introduced, predictions about reputation formation become sensitive to
key aspects of the context---the central actor's initial reputation, the
stakes involved, the costs of fighting, and how rapidly conflict
depletes resources+ Fighting and appeasing have very different
consequences for a state's reputation---and payoffs---when these
circumstances are different+ Appeasing in one context does not imply one
will appease in others+ 15 I do not claim to be discovering a completely
new idea+ Since the time of Thucydides, many writers have noted the
usefulness of what I call appeasement+ [However, such notions have
largely been eclipsed by the elegant formulations of theorists such as
Schelling and the general horror at the consequences of Munich+ By
[presenting]{.mark} [a simple model that includes resource
constraints]{.mark} and **[rationalizes]{.mark} selective
[appeasement]{.mark}**, I hope to suggest the need for
reconsideration+]{.underline}

[To be more specific, [repeatedly harping on Munich conveniently
discards all the occasions when great powers]{.mark} made themselves
more secure without war by [reach]{.mark}ing [mutually beneficial
accommodations with a rival]{.mark}. We tend to **overlook the
successful examples of accommodation** because when the results are
unremarkable, life goes on, and there isn't a big war to grab our
attention]{.underline}. Yet "nonevents" of this kind can be just as
informative as the more dramatic situations where states failed to
resolve their differences and went to war instead. Looking for [[some
examples]{.underline} of **[successful
appeasement]{.underline}**]{.mark}? How about the [[1955 Austrian State
Treaty]{.underline},]{.mark} which removed Soviet troops from that
country in exchange for a declaration of neutrality?
[[Or]{.underline}]{.mark} [consider [the various **arms control
treaties** negotiated between the United States and the Soviet Union,

to remove Jupiter missiles in Turkey in exchange for Khrushchev
withdrawing the nuclear-armed missiles he had tried to install in Cuba,
[[and we may all be alive today because]{.mark} Kennedy acted as [he
did]{.mark}. U.S. President Richard **[Nixon and]{.mark}** then-National
Security Advisor Henry **[Kissinger]{.mark} [did something
similar]{.mark}** when they agreed [to]{.mark} the "One China" policy

[[We need]{.mark}, then, [a]{.mark} much [more serious examination of
just war thinking than an easy dismissal of pagan
vanity]{.mark}.]{.underline} What do we mean if we say that we should
not wage war (or continue a war already underway) unless we have a
reasonable hope of success in achieving our war aims? Everything depends
on what those aims are and what we mean by success. In pondering this I
have returned to what is surely [one of]{.underline} [the best books
written on just war thinking, Michael [Walzer]{.mark}'s Just and Unjust
Wars. There are always, Walzer [notes]{.mark}, [inviting reasons to
appease an aggressor:]{.mark} "[Aggression most often takes the form of
an attack by a powerful state upon a weak one. . . . **Resistance seems
imprudent**, even hopeless. Many **lives will be lost**, and to what
end?]{.mark}"]{.underline} That is the realist argument for appeasement,
and we recognize its force, even as we may feel shame at simply
surrendering to power.

### Appeasement Good \-\-- AT Hitler

#### Appeasement is fundamentally good, but Munich changed perception.

[Neville [Chamberlain did not live long after the collapse of his
appeasement policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} He resigned as prime minister
and was replaced by Churchill in May 1940, after Norway had fallen to
the Nazis, and died six months later. [[Although his efforts failed to
prevent war, even Chamberlain's fiercest critics conceded that he was
driven by the purest of motives, a deeply felt desire for peace.]{.mark}
Historian Martin [Gilbert]{.mark}, for instance, [wrote]{.mark} in 1966
[that **appeasement "was not a silly or treacherous idea** in the minds
of stubborn]{.mark}, gullible [men, but **a noble idea, rooted
in**]{.mark} **Christianity, [courage and common
sense]{.mark}.**]{.underline}"\[13\] In the decades after World War II,
as more government and private records became opened to researchers, a
school of historians emerged to defend Chamberlain and appeasement. An
early voice in this debate was the distinguished British historian
A.J.P. Taylor, who called the settlement at Munich "a triumph for
British policy, which had worked precisely to this end."\[14\] The term
appeasement has had a long life since the end of World War II,
especially in American foreign policy rhetoric. In 1976, for instance,
then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote that "For a generation
after World War II, statesmen and nations were traumatized by the
experience of Munich; they believed that history had shown the folly of
permitting an adversary to gain a preponderance of power. This was and
remains a crucial lesson."\[15\] [More recently, historians Fredrik
Logevall and Kenneth Osgood observed that ["'Munich' and 'appeasement'
have been among the dirtiest words in American
politics]{.mark},]{.underline} synonymous with naïveté and weakness,
[and]{.mark} signifying a craven willingness to barter away the
nation\'s vital interests for empty promises."\[16\] With the failure of
the Munich Agreement and the outbreak of World War II, ["appeasement"
[evolved]{.mark} permanently [from a **positive negotiating tactic**
into an unforgivable diplomatic sin.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Appeasement is fundamentally good\-\--Alt causes led to British failure.

https://daily.jstor.org/reconsidering-appeasement/), SA

[[Political scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} Norrin M. Ripsman and Jack
S. Levy note that the traditional view of Munich "condemned the British
and French appeasement of Germany as politically naïve and morally
bankrupt." Before Munich, appeasement, which had been conventionally
"defined as the satisfaction of grievances through unilateral
concessions, with the aim of avoiding war," had been an "honorable and
effective strategy of statecraft." Afterwards, "it came to symbolize
naïveté, failed diplomacy, and the politics of cowardice." Winston
Churchill called the appeaser "one who feeds the crocodile, hoping it
will eat him last." [[Ripsman and Levy want to rehabilitate the concept
of appeasement as a tool of statecraft.]{.mark} They note [it can be
used for several purposes, including to "buy time to build up strength
for deterrence or defense against the adversary."]{.mark}]{.underline}
They argue that this is what the British were up to. Chamberlain's
Conservative government knew they faced a growing Nazi threat. But they
didn't think they would win a war against Germany. They were buying time
for rearmament, "thus delaying the likely confrontation until Britain
was adequately prepared for war." By 1939, British defense spending as a
percentage of total government expenditures was 48%; in 1935 it had been
15%. Ripsman and Levy suggest the literature of international relations
hasn't caught up with the historical literature. Since the 1960s-era
declassification of [[British]{.underline}]{.mark} documents,
[[appeasement]{.underline}]{.mark} has been understood by many
historians quite differently: "[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[the
product of naïve idealists, but rather the consequences of poor
intelligence, military weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}, multiple threats,
and a fear of overtaxing the British economy through rapid wartime
mobilization." [Concluding that [scholars need to "**broaden the
traditional conception of appeasement**,"]{.mark} Ripsman and Levy also
quote none other than Winston Churchill, addressing Parliament in 1950:
"[Appeasement in itself may be good]{.mark} or bad according to the
circumstances. Appeasement from weakness and fear is alike futile and
fatal. [Appeasement from strength is magnanimous and noble and might be
surest and perhaps **the only path to world
peace."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

In [a surprise [turnaround]{.mark} on the [Ukraine

the **[U.S. would continue supplying weapons]{.mark}** to
[Ukraine]{.mark} and would [inflict economic pain]{.mark} on [Russia
if]{.mark} it [failed]{.mark} to make a [peace

\"a full complement\" of U.S. weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---including
Patriot missile batteries---[to [give]{.mark} to
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, portraying the deal as lucrative for the
U.S. And [he said that [if]{.mark} Russia did [not agree]{.mark} to a
[cease-fire]{.mark} within 50 days, he would [apply **tariffs of 100%**
on countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, like China and India, [[that import
Russian oil and other goods.]{.mark} [Trump]{.mark} has increasingly
expressed [frustration with]{.mark}]{.underline} the duplicity of
Russian President [Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"My
conversations with him are always very pleasant,\" he said, \"and then
the missiles go off that night.\" On a recent call with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump reportedly floated the idea of
Ukraine striking Moscow and St. Petersburg, although this week he walked
that back and said Zelensky should not do so.

[[Republican lawmakers who]{.mark} had previously [opposed aid to
Ukraine **fell in line**]{.mark} **after the president\'s
announcement**.]{.underline} \"I call him the peacemaker in chief,\"
said Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.). \"He has my 100% absolute,
unequivocal support.\" Meanwhile, despite the ultimatum, Russia
continued pounding Ukraine this week, launching hundreds of drone and
missile strikes on six Ukrainian regions and targeting civilian
buildings. Zelensky\'s hometown, Kryvyi Rih, suffered its biggest attack
since the war began.

[Neville [Chamberlain']{.mark}s "peace for our time" [comment]{.mark},
made in [1938 after]{.mark} the [Munich Agreement]{.mark} with
[Hitler]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[reflects]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [historical use of [appeasement]{.mark}]{.underline} to avoid
conflict. However, this [approach ultimately [failed]{.mark}, as it
[emboldened Hitler,]{.mark} **leading to [World War
II.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In the present situation with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there's a
focus on not repeating the mistakes of appeasement. Democracies around
the world have reacted with sanctions, condemnations, and support for
Ukraine. The [belief is that [appeasing
authoritarianism]{.mark},]{.underline} as seen with Russia's actions,
[often [emboldens aggressors]{.mark}]{.underline} and can [lead to
**[further conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}... for now.

The [theme remains relevant]{.underline} today: [[Appeasement]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the [face of tyranny]{.underline} is [generally [seen
as]{.mark} a [short-term solution]{.mark}]{.underline} that can
[ultimately [result]{.mark} in more [significant]{.mark} and protracted
[conflicts. Democracies should strive]{.mark} to take a [firm]{.mark}
stance [against authoritarianism]{.mark} to **[maintain peace and
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[1938]{.underline}]{.mark} Munich
agreement, Western democracies --- particularly Britain and France ---
sought to appease Adolf Hitler by allowing him to annex parts of
Czechoslovakia. [The [hope was]{.mark} that by [satisfying
Hitler]{.mark}'s territorial ambitions, they could [prevent
war.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Munich Agreement failed as it [[didn't
deter]{.mark} Hitler's **[expansionist agenda]{.mark}**. Instead, it
[emboldened]{.mark} him, and within a year, [W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar
[II began.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This historical example [[highlights]{.mark} that [concessions]{.mark}
to [authoritarian]{.mark} regime]{.underline}s, motivated by a desire to
avoid conflict, often [[backfire]{.mark}, as [aggressors see
**appeasement as weakness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Putin, like Hitler, is
well aware of this and is betting Europe will fold.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014 (its annexation of Crimea) and
the [ongoing [invasion]{.mark} of [Ukraine serve]{.mark} as
[contemporary]{.mark} [examples]{.mark} of aggression by an
authoritarian regime]{.underline}. Western democracies, including the
European Union and the United States, have responded with economic
sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and support for Ukraine politically and
militarily. They are apparently avoiding appeasement and instead showing
solidarity against Russian aggression. Time will tell.

The [[lesson]{.mark} from history [is]{.mark} that [appeasement doesn't
guarantee **lasting peace**]{.mark}**.** Authoritarian [regimes]{.mark}
often [perceive]{.mark} it [as]{.mark} an [opportunity]{.mark} to
[further]{.mark} their [ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
[situation]{.underline} in [[Ukraine underscores]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[importance]{.mark} of [democracies standing
together]{.mark}]{.underline} against authoritarianism to [[deter
aggression and **maintain global stability.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Democracies today are generally guided by a commitment to international
norms, human rights, and the sovereignty of nations. They view
authoritarian regimes that undermine these principles as threats to the
global order. Instead of appeasement, democracies advocate for
diplomacy, multilateralism, and international institutions to resolve
conflicts peacefully and promote cooperation among nations backed by the
use of lawful force. The [[goal]{.mark} is [to]{.mark} [prevent
conflicts]{.mark} from [escalating]{.mark} into [large-scale
wars,]{.mark} as seen in the past.]{.underline}

The [[theme that]{.mark} "[appeasement]{.mark} in the face of tyranny
[never works]{.mark} and always [leads to conflict]{.mark} eventually"
is **[based]{.mark} on [historical]{.mark} lessons.**]{.underline}
Modern [[democracies should apply]{.mark} these]{.underline} lessons by
taking a [[firm stance against]{.mark} authoritarian regimes like
[Russia]{.mark},]{.underline} using [diplomatic means, sanctions, and
international cooperation to promote peace and uphold democratic
values]{.underline} with a determined showing of military might. The
hope is that through these efforts, the cycle of appeasement and
subsequent conflict can be broken, leading to a [[more stable]{.mark}
and peaceful [world]{.mark} order. **[Other regimes]{.mark} are
[watching]{.mark}**]{.underline} what the global community chooses to do
about Russian aggression.

[[Time]{.mark} and [distraction]{.mark} are **[Putin's ultimate
weapon.]{.mark}**]{.underline} He [knows Europe lacks]{.underline} the
long-term [ability to stay focused and determined to face down his
aggression]{.underline} and hold him accountable for those aggressive
acts. You can almost feel the resolve of democracies to stand firm
against Russia slipping through our fingers. It happened in Syria. We
can't let it happen with Ukraine[. [If we do]{.mark} little to
[nothing]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} will [follow]{.mark}. Through
history, **we know this to be true.**]{.underline}

### Appeasement Bad \-\-- AT: Trump

#### Trump IS appeasing through pressures on Ukraine to give land to Russia.

**Robinson '25**\[Nick; May 7; British journalist, presenter on BBC;
BBC, "Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC,"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9mvemxrwo>\]

[Joe Biden]{.underline} has told the BBC that [[pressure from]{.mark}
the [Trump]{.mark} administration on [Ukraine]{.mark} to [give up
territory]{.mark} to Russia [is \"**modern-day
appeasement**\"]{.mark}]{.underline} in an exclusive interview, his
first since leaving the White House.

Speaking in Delaware on Monday, he said [Russian President Vladimir
[Putin believed Ukraine]{.mark} was [part]{.mark} of [Russia]{.mark} and
\"[anybody that thinks he\'s going to stop]{.mark}\" [if]{.mark} some
[territory]{.mark} is [conceded]{.mark} as part of a peace deal
**\"[is]{.mark} just [foolish]{.mark}\".**]{.underline}

Biden, who spoke as Allied nations mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day
this week, said he was [concerned about [US-Europe **relations breaking
down**]{.mark} under President Donald Trump]{.underline}, which he said
[\"would [change]{.mark} the modern [history]{.mark} of the
world\".]{.underline}

#### Not only does it collapse U.S. EU relations breaking down, but allowing dictator Putin access to land causes NATO concessions too

**Robinson '25**\[Nick; May 7; British journalist, presenter on BBC;
BBC, "Trump appeasing Putin with pressure on Ukraine, Biden tells BBC,"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9mvemxrwo>\]

Discussing Putin, Biden said: \"[I just [don\'t understand how people
think]{.mark} that if we allow a [dictator]{.mark}, a thug, to
[decide]{.mark} he\'s [going to take significant portions of land that
aren\'t his]{.mark}, that that\'s [going to satisfy]{.mark}
him.]{.underline} I don\'t quite understand.\"

He also said he feared [[some countries in]{.mark} the [Nato]{.mark}
alliance that [border Russia]{.mark} may \"just [say]{.mark} we\'ve [got
to **make**]{.mark} **an [accommodation]{.mark}**\" to Putin [if
Ukraine]{.mark} ultimately [gives up land.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The international order is destabalized.]{.underline}

#### Trump's ceasefire plan is active appeasement --- it rewards Russian aggression, concedes territory, undermines NATO, and invites future wars.

**Aron '25**\[Leon; March 21; Senior Fellow at American Enterprise
Institute; The Hill, "There's only one word to describe Trump's
negotiations with Russia: appeasement,"
<https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5205879-trump-putin-appeasement/>\]

In what by now looks like a pattern, in his most recent phone call with
President Trump, Vladimir Putin again rejected the White House ceasefire
--- and again piled up still more preconditions before even considering
one.

Perhaps still more important in the long run was Trump's reaction. So
far, the [record of the [White House's negotiations]{.mark} with the
[Kremlin]{.mark} amounts to [appeasement]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
[appeasements [tend to **lead to more war**]{.mark}**s.** This time, the
[outcome]{.mark} could be a **[European
conflagration]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark} and]{.underline} [his top national security
officials]{.underline} have [persistently [encouraged
Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} by [preemptively [conceding]{.mark} some of
[Moscow's key condition]{.mark}]{.underline}. There shall be no NATO
membership for Ukraine, ever. Nor the recovery of the Ukrainian
territory seized by Russia since 2014. No peacekeepers either.

When, in the Kremlin's typical outburst of propaganda lies, [[Foreign
Minister]{.mark} Sergei Lavrov [rejected]{.mark} a [European
peacekeeping force]{.mark} as "undisguised involvement of NATO countries
in a war against the Russian Federation," he [needn't have
bothered.]{.mark} By [refusing]{.mark} to [commit]{.mark} the
[U.S]{.mark}. to **["backstop" security guarantees]{.mark}** for the
European peacekeepers, [Trump]{.mark} had [already]{.mark} effectively
[vetoed]{.mark} the deployment.]{.underline}

[**Even "[de-Nazification]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} one of the Kremlin's
more bizarre official reasons for the invasion, [has been]{.underline},
in effect, [[embraced]{.mark} by [Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Standing for the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Western government led by the
[[**Jewish Zelensky**, Trump's de-legitimation]{.mark} of Ukraine's
[president]{.mark} has been [relentless]{.mark}]{.underline}. Zelensky
[was a "[dictato]{.mark}r" [who would not hold]{.mark} presidential
[elections]{.mark}]{.underline} (which [Ukraine's [constitution
suspends]{.mark} in [wartime]{.mark}]{.underline}). He was
[[guilty]{.mark} of personally [profiting]{.mark} from what Trump called
the "[gravy train]{.mark}" of U.S. assistance.]{.underline} The
vilification reached a crescendo when, after prolonged castigation,
Zelensky was accused of "disrespecting the United States of America in
its cherished Oval Office."

[**[Having pocketed the freebies]{.mark}**, the Kremlin [dictator

Shorn of the U.S. protection and facing a newly resurgent and aggressive

As society comes to terms with the realities of a cyber-enabled world,
[[the consequences of cyber]{.underline} attacks]{.mark} will most
likely increase as strong actors seek to deter their weaker adversaries.
The advantage that cyber attacks afford weaker actors can be mitigated
through consequences in the physical space. [[These consequences will
most likely drive **cyber competition toward covert activities**
conducted through proxies and surrogates]{.underline}.]{.mark} The
effects of cyber operations will seek to shape the environment for a
competitive advantage in conflict, but the results of cyber operations
will most likely not be decisive outcomes. Instead, cyber operations
will be incorporated into other forms of strategic interaction,
including wartime functions, as a supporting effort, much the same way
current covert action is incorporated as a policy-shaping mechanism. The
potential of covert social movement and manipulation outweighs the risk
of overt actions, either cyber or war. [[The risk **calculus weighs
heavily into the covert realm**, even if only as a shaping action with
potential for full-scale success]{.mark}. [The net benefits of indirect
cyber operations are a **potential outlet** for actors to compete in a
**nonlethal way**, continuing the trend of making warfare more precise
and leading **away from large-scale loss of life.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
The threat is the limiting effect that security requirements have on the
technology surrounding a modern world and the vulnerabilities that
exposure to cyber operations creates in a hyper-connected planet[. [The
opportunities to engineer an environment to promote social change from
within an adversary's borders]{.mark}, while managing escalation
potential, demonstrate that [covert cyber operations are a growth

Senior officials such as Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warn that the
\"next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyber attack.\"
[But what if [cyberwarfare is not such a bad thing after all]{.mark},
though[? What if it saves lives?]{.mark} The [evidence]{.mark} so far
actually [suggests]{.mark} that [**cyberwarfare costs fewer lives**
compared with traditional types of warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
prevailing view, however, holds that cyberwar is a terrifying prospect.
The influential 2010 book Cyberwar, for instance --- co-authored by
Richard A. [[Clarke]{.underline}]{.mark}, who was responsible for
cybersecurity at the White House until 2003 --- [[paints a gloomy
picture of potential future cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark} that could
involve cutting millions of people off the electrical grid or, worse, as
in the case of an attack on aviation control or a nuclear power plant,
cost thousands of lives. [Yet the [evidence]{.mark} of cyberwarfare, so
far, [reveals a very different picture]{.mark}. The [cyberattack]{.mark}
on Estonia in 2007 was the first to make major international headlines.
But its **[damage was limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attack overburdened servers in Estonia and
brought down several websites. Something similar happened in Georgia
during the war in 2008. [Such [attacks]{.mark} could theoretically cost
lives if they shut down emergency hotlines, for example. But they're

[[Cyber War is diplomacy by other means.]{.underline}]{.mark}\[1\] It is
the use by a nation-state of computers and telecommunications networks
to harm an opponent. It has been described as a Revolution in Military
Affairs (RMA),\[2\] meaning that [[its use can have a strategic effect
on the outcome of a conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many billions of
dollars have been invested by all major nations in development of these
war-fighting capabilities.\[3\] R&D continues today. [But in spite of
occasional success in information operation attacks here and there, the
proxy conflict that has broken out between the United States and Russia
in Ukraine shows that [cyber has at best a peripheral effect on a war's
outcome]{.mark}.]{.underline} This gap between what is expected of cyber
and what actually is delivered is a result of different definitions of
cyberwar and how they are expressed in national defense doctrines---some
more inclusive than others. Below, we examine several instances of
cyberwar in Ukraine: [the Maidan Revolution, the 2014 annexation by
Russia of Crimea, the 2015 attack against the electrical power grid, and
the current war which started in February 2022]{.underline}. These
examples cover a wide range of actions under the broad umbrella of
"cyberwar."\[4\] [What they will show is that cyber is effective in the
propaganda and information operations realm. [It]{.mark} also [is useful
in support of police operations having a moderate level of violence. But
in real warfare]{.mark}, cyber is not a key factor in determining the
outcome. In fact, as war intensifies, [the efficacy of cyber
rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline} [diminishes to zero]{.mark}.

### Cyber Wars\-\--Offensive\-\--1AR

#### Offensive Cyber Capabilities key.

SA

Oversimplified, there are four areas of disagreement between doubters
and pessimists. Lack of Clarity about "Revolutionary" or Relevant"
Debates between doubters and pessimists can sometimes steer to the
extreme positions of "revolutionary" or "irrelevant," rather than
gradations such as revolutionary, necessary, relevant, and largely
irrelevant. To be revolutionary, [[cyber
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} would need to have an effect that
either (a) [[is novel and]{.underline}]{.mark} not achievable by other
methods or (b) [[drastically decreased cost]{.underline}]{.mark} or
increased scale. A high-end revolutionary capability would transform the
fundamental nature of war, not just particular ways in which it is
fought. A lower-end revolutionary capability might merely be decisive
--- "revolutionary" as in the 1990s' "revolution in military affairs."
Below that, [[offensive cyber operations]{.mark} may not be
revolutionary but [still necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like defensive
electronic warfare, they may be an often-essential part of modern battle
to avoid being blinded or disrupted. [[Cyber operations]{.mark} may be
merely relevant, providing substantial, but circumstantial, advantages,
used if they prove [more available or effective than other
capabilities]{.mark}. [Particularly adept commanders might integrate
them in stunning ways --- matching their strengths with the
opportunities presented by the adversary]{.mark} --- that may be hard
for others to mimic.]{.underline} Lastly, some capabilities in some
instances may be largely irrelevant.

[[To compete and win]{.mark} in this new arena, [the U.S. must take a

of answering the call for the cyber and AI race, many of our best young

### Cyber War \-\-- Conflict

#### [CYBERWARS DECREASE GLOBAL VIOLENCE.]{.underline}

Cybèle C. **Greenberg** **21** Cybèle C. Greenberg is a fellow with the

<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/22/opinion/cyberwar-world-safety.html>
//PK

The battles in a global cyberwar are visible only through periodic
glances in the rearview mirror: Indra, Colonial Pipeline, SolarWinds,
WannaCry.

Such an episodic view obscures the fact that this jousting by
nation-states, criminal networks and private actors is happening
constantly --- right now --- without foreseeable end.

It's hard to wrap our minds around that. It's a departure from thousands
of years of conventional warfare that leaves us wondering how exactly to
categorize cyberattacks. Are they espionage? Sabotage? Acts of war? Some
cyberattacks, like North Korea's targeting of Sony Pictures, entail
central involvement from states. Others, like ransomware, are simply
criminal. But the spy and the hacker have a lot in common: They both
trespass into others' information.

During the Cold War, the United States, China and Russia sat on
stockpiles of world-ending weapons. Now, these same countries routinely
employ an array of offensive cyberweapons, though not quite to their
full power grid-zapping, water system-clogging, society-crippling
potential.

Indeed, [[despite its many consequences and dangers, there is no
documented instance in which cyberwarfare has directly killed
anyone]{.underline}]{.mark} (although it has come close).

As the post-Sept. 11 conflicts come to an abrupt end, we are now at an
important crossroads when it comes to determining just how far we are
willing to take cyberwar. One possible avenue points to perilous
conflict escalation between great powers further enabled by digital
technologies.

But an [[alternative perspective sees cyberwar as an opportunity to
decrease global violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Could [[such tactics
shift war's focus away from human casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}?

In other words, can nations settle for slugging it out online, rather
than with guns and missiles?

[[Fighting digitally offers a unique opportunity: the continuation of
politics by other means, without the physical invasion of a sovereign
territory or the inevitable sacrifice of lives.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Tempered by responsible use and appropriate controls, [[cyberwarfare is
a safer and more flexible strategic alternative, one critical step
between sanctions and bombs.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"[[The purpose of warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} is not to fight; it [[is
to achieve a political objective]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Nora
Bensahel, a visiting professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies. "[[If you can achieve this
objective without kinetic conflict, so much the
better.]{.underline}]{.mark}"

Consider Nitro Zeus. In the late 2000s, as The Times reported, the U.S.
government developed a detailed plan for cyberattacks that would disable
sections of Iran's air defenses, communications systems and power grid.
The plan provided President Barack Obama with a nonlethal means to
neutralize Iranian military assets in case negotiations to halt the
country's rogue nuclear enrichment program failed and Tehran sought to
retaliate.

The Nitro Zeus contingency plan remained active until the fulfillment of
terms in the nuclear deal signed in 2015, ready to offer phased
escalation short of all-out war if diplomatic and economic pressures
proved ineffective.

Since Nitro Zeus was ultimately shelved, it is difficult to assess the
scope and likelihood of the collateral damage it could have caused. The
integration of cyberweapons into a national security strategy points to
a certain reluctance to default to the conventional --- and more lethal
--- option. But whether it's a drone strike or the hacking of a
telecommunications network, a cyberattack will always have harmful
repercussions for civilians and private enterprises.

Counterintuitively, however, [[cyberweapons can also increase
geopolitical stability.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Cyberattacks have helped nations achieve nuclear nonproliferation in a
way that]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the past, [[would have required
physical force]{.underline}]{.mark} and increased risk to personnel,
said Vipin Narang, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who
specializes in nuclear strategy.

In 2007, [[Israeli fighter jets]{.underline}]{.mark} equipped with
500-pound bombs [[struck a suspected nuclear
reactor]{.underline}]{.mark} in Syria. The facility was destroyed and
Israel was internationally criticized for violating another country's
sovereignty. Ten North Korean scientists reportedly may have been killed
in the attack.

The U.S.-Israeli offensive cyber operation known as
[[Stuxnet]{.underline}]{.mark}, which was launched around the same time,
[[achieved a similar objective --- impeding a rogue
nation's]{.underline}]{.mark} enrichment [[efforts --- but from afar,
with no human cost.]{.underline}]{.mark} The program destroyed nearly
one-fifth of Iran's operating centrifuges and may have slowed its
nuclear program by up to two years. [[No one was reported to have been
physically harmed]{.underline}]{.mark} or killed during the yearslong
operation. It may have even deterred Israel from launching a
conventional attack on Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment site.

What does responsible use of cyberweapons look like going forward?

If [[cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark} has the potential to channel conflict
into a nonlethal form, now is the moment --- before it is fully tested
on the battlefield --- to [[develop both treaties and unwritten
customary laws governing its employment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Leaders in the technology sector such as Brad Smith, the president of
Microsoft, and William Leigher, a retired Navy rear admiral and former
cyber strategist at Raytheon, have repeatedly called for the creation of
a digital Geneva Convention that would mandate restraint in the exercise
of cyberweapons and prevent the sabotaging of civilian infrastructure.

When it comes to international deterrence, history shows us that U.S.
leadership is key: Cold War-era multinational organizations such as the
International Atomic Energy Agency were chartered at the behest of U.S.
presidents, after all. The Biden administration should continue to
champion restraint and caution in the context of cyberwarfare.

This means avoiding misattribution and curbing for-profit cybercrime.
The cyber realm is still shrouded in secrecy. A mechanism to keep open
lines of communications between the U.S. and its adversaries after an
attack could limit false accusations and prevent events from spiraling
out of control. Regarding ransomware, the Biden administration is right
to encourage reporting, discourage compliance with perpetrators and
provide financial assistance to victims.

The much feared cyber-Pearl Harbor that's so much fodder for cable news?
"Chances are, we will never see such an event," said Dmitri Alperovitch,
a cofounder of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike and now chairman of the
think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator. "But it's death by a thousand
cuts, where every week, every day, we get hit by a ransomware attack."

With proper controls and some rules of the road, [[cyberwar between
nations may not be all that bad.]{.underline}]{.mark} Instead of
endangering lives, it could actually help save them. That's an important
idea to keep in mind when news of the next big hack breaks.

active [[cyber operations]{.mark} can be [used 'to disrupt the

foreign cyber operations may include 'any other activity that
is reasonable in the circumstances and reasonably necessary in aid
of any other
activity'.[[33]{.underline}](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/09/offensive-cyber-operations/CHHP10610-ISP-069-Cyber-Risk-vs-Reward-RP-INT-230918-2.xhtml#footnote-058) **[Foreign
[cyber operations are depicted as having considerable utility, both
as a focused and a supporting activity for a wide range
of threats.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Another key theme in the responses to the interviews conducted for this
paper was that [[cyber operations are often viewed as a substitute for
the use of force in peacetime,]{.mark} in that [they can be used
to affect national sources of power without conducting an armed attack
or triggering conflict.]{.mark} This is in keeping with much of the

subject]{.underline}.[[34]{.underline}](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/09/offensive-cyber-operations/CHHP10610-ISP-069-Cyber-Risk-vs-Reward-RP-INT-230918-2.xhtml#footnote-057) [The
ability this affords many states to pursue foreign policy objectives
is perceived as one of the key reasons why [offensive cyber has real
value for some states]{.mark}.]{.underline} An interview with
a representative from USCYBERCOM confirmed this view, for example: the
utility of offensive cyber capabilities lies in enabling strategic
effect without entitling the adversary to use force in self-defence,
coupled with a unique ability to modulate the level of impact in a way
that is not possible with kinetic
operations.[[35]{.underline}](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/09/offensive-cyber-operations/CHHP10610-ISP-069-Cyber-Risk-vs-Reward-RP-INT-230918-2.xhtml#footnote-056) Similarly,
an interview with the then commander of UK Strategic Command (UK
STRATCOM), offensive cyber was explained as a means by which a message
can be sent, so as to manage strategic
rivalries.[[36]{.underline}](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/09/offensive-cyber-operations/CHHP10610-ISP-069-Cyber-Risk-vs-Reward-RP-INT-230918-2.xhtml#footnote-055) Sally
Walker, former cyber director at the UK's Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ), reported in a Sky News podcast that the UK sees
cyber operations as being 'about what you can do from a distance
at relatively low risk \[...\] you can have impact in the real world and
you can do it
at scale'.[[37]{.underline}](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/09/offensive-cyber-operations/CHHP10610-ISP-069-Cyber-Risk-vs-Reward-RP-INT-230918-2.xhtml#footnote-054) Offensive
cyber activity is thus often viewed both as a strategic
alternative to war and as having value on the battlefield.

Further, the UK has recently given more public detail on how the NCF
seeks to deliver a 'doctrine of cognitive effect' through cyber
operations which seeks to affect adversaries' abilities in three main
ways. First, [to affect their 'ability to acquire, analyse and exploit
the information they need to advance their objectives', second,
to 'limit their ability to communicate and coordinate with others', and
third, to 'affect their confidence in their digital technology and the

Imagine two universes. In the first one, information systems are

can change the instructions that systems run and systems react to all
input as they are supposed to (that is, consistent with the common

potentially consequence; it where we live today.

In which universe is violent conflict -- war, if you will -- more

centrifuges in Iran's uranium-enrichment facility, Natanz. [[Had the
means of cyberwar not been available]{.underline}]{.mark}, they argue,
[[there is a serious likelihood that Israel or]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[St]{.underline}]{.mark}ates [[would
have tried to destroy Natanz using air raids]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such
air raids [[would likely have produced casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Furthermore, [[the use of violence might have begotten violence in
return]{.underline}]{.mark} -- more likely terrorism (given Iran's modus
operandi) than open war, but the latter could not have been ruled out.
Thus, the [[existence of Stuxnet allowed the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark} created by Iran's desire to enrich uranium
(in order to making nuclear weapons) [[to be dealt with in a nonviolent
way.]{.underline}]{.mark} To the extent that Stuxnet is archetypical,
cyberwar is good for peace.

This paper argues that the case that cyberwar is good for peace is by no
means so clear, something that can be demonstrated by a more rounded
analysis of what cyberwar does and what the alternatives to cyberwar
really are. To start, consider another attack on the (supposed) nuclear
facility being constructed in Syria with North Korean
help. [\[2\]](file:///fichiers/Affaires_Publiques_et_Communication/FIC2014/Contributions/Panneaux/contribution/Libicki_Martin_article.docx#_ftn2) In
2007, Israeli jets destroyed this facility (Operation Orchard).
According to Richard Clarke (and others), the air strike was aided by a
cyberattack on Syria's air defense system which essentially erased radar
images of incoming aircraft allowing all the aircraft to make it back
safely.[\[3\]](file:///fichiers/Affaires_Publiques_et_Communication/FIC2014/Contributions/Panneaux/contribution/Libicki_Martin_article.docx#_ftn3) Now
suppose that a cyberattack really was employed (other accounts say that
more conventional electronic warfare was
used[\[4\]](file:///fichiers/Affaires_Publiques_et_Communication/FIC2014/Contributions/Panneaux/contribution/Libicki_Martin_article.docx#_ftn4)).
Further suppose that, without the confidence that cyberwar would have
disabled the radar, the raid's planners would have been deemed it too
costly in terms of lost aircraft and pilots and hence called it off. In
the first universe, where the tools of cyberwar were unavailable, no
raid would have taken place, no destruction would have ensued, and no
casualties (Operation Orchard left one to two dozen dead) would have
resulted. In that calculus, the cyberwar capabilities lead to more
rather than less violence. Had Syria retaliated, a further cycle of
violence might have commenced.

This example suggests that the picture is a little more complicated than
the notion that cyberwar allows nonviolent means to replace violent
means. A full analysis must ask (1) what choices are available with and
without cyberwar, (2) what responses are likely to a cyberwar attack,
and (3) what does the threat of cyberwar say for the likelihood of
conflict, qua stability. Such analyses also have to be sensitive to
different contexts. What may hold for a conflict among comparably strong
countries may not hold for a conflict among countries, one of which is
clearly stronger than the other. Furthermore, the possibility of
operational cyberwar (used against an opponent's military forces) may
lead to different answers than the possibility of strategic cyberwar
(used against an opponent's infrastructure and society, usually away
from the battlefield).

But first: why does this question matter? Normally, comparing the world
as it is to a counterfactual world in which something had not taken
place is a completely academic exercise. Un-invention never takes place
(even if people do walk away from some technologies -- nuclear power
comes to mind). Weapons control is oft pursued and only occasionally
succeeds (chemical and biological weapons provide the best example, but
such weapons have low military utility, anyway). Although people worry
about cyberattacks, the fact that they are not heinous -- and, indeed,
have yet to hurt anyone directly -- coupled with the technical
difficulties of enforcing arms control on virtual instruments of war
suggests that they are unlikely to be banned. Norms against certain uses
of cyberwar may have better chances, but they may also be worth less in
terms of assurance.

However, [[cyberweapons are fairly unique among weapons in that their
effectiveness depends entirely on the system being
hacked.]{.underline}]{.mark} Conversely, one can imagine a world without
cyberwar (or at cyberwar with serious consequences) even if nothing has
to be un-invented for such a world to exist. If systems were perfect,
almost all forms of cyberwar would be impossible. Even though perfection
is impossible in this mortal world, it is possible for systems to become
more impervious to cyberwar given a combination of resources and correct
choices (e.g., which systems are isolated by what means, how easy it is
to insert rogue instructions into a system). [[A world in which the
existence of cyberwar increases the predisposition to war is one that
favors increasing attention to cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}
(notwithstanding the many other benefits to cybersecurity in terms of
reduced crime). [[One in which the existence of cyberwar reduces the
prospect for violent conflict is one in which such efforts might be
relaxed without making the world a far worse place.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Policy Institute in Berlin. "The Case for Cyberwarfare"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/10/19/the-case-for-cyberwarfare/> //PK

According to an
intriguing [story](https://archive.ph/o/dBv7k/https:/www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/world/africa/cyber-warfare-against-libya-was-debated-by-us.html) in
this week's New York Times, the Obama administration decided not to use
cyberwarfare against Libya, opting instead for a conventional attack on
Muammar al-Qaddafi's defense installations. Officials feared that it
would set a precedent and invite other countries (think: China, Russia)
to use similar means of attack in the future. As James Lewis, a
cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, succinctly put it, \"We don't want to be the ones who break the
glass on this new kind of warfare.\"

Senior officials such as Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warn that the
\"next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a cyber attack.\" But
what if [[cyberwarfare is not such a bad thing]{.underline}]{.mark}
after all, though? What if [[it saves lives]{.underline}]{.mark}? The
evidence so far actually suggests that [[cyberwarfare costs fewer lives
compared with traditional types of warfare.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[prevailing view]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[holds that
cyberwar is a terrifying prospect]{.underline}]{.mark}. The influential
2010 book Cyberwar, for instance --- co-authored by Richard A. Clarke,
who was responsible for cybersecurity at the White House until 2003 ---
paints a gloomy picture of potential future cyberattacks that could
involve cutting millions of people off the electrical grid or, worse, as
in the case of an attack on aviation control or a nuclear power plant,
cost thousands of lives.

[[Yet the evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} of cyberwarfare, so far,
[[reveals a very different picture.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[The ]{.underline}[cyberattack on Estonia in
2007](https://archive.ph/o/dBv7k/https:/www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-09/ff_estonia)]{.mark} was
the first to make major international headlines. But its damage [[was
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}: The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
attack overburdened servers in Estonia and brought down several
websites.
Something [similar](https://archive.ph/o/dBv7k/https:/www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/technology/13cyber.html) happened
in Georgia during the war in 2008. Such attacks could theoretically cost
lives if they shut down emergency hotlines, for example. But they're not
the sort of thing that should keep us up at night.

The [[Stuxnet]{.underline}]{.mark} virus, on the other hand, [[was a
very different animal]{.underline}]{.mark}. It infected computer systems
and altered code in a way that made it too risky to run centrifuges used
in Iran's nuclear facilities. Some experts estimate that Stuxnet pushed
back Iran's nuclear development by several months, [possibly
years](https://archive.ph/o/dBv7k/https:/www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/world/middleeast/16stuxnet.html),
and what's wrong with that? [[This particular cyberattack may have
actually saved rather than cost lives. ]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### [CYBERATTACKS DECREASE POLITICAL VIOLENCE.]{.underline}

*Foreign Affairs* Volume 92 Issue 6 //PK

Cyberwar Is Coming!" declared the title of a seminal 1993 article by the
rand Corporation analysts John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt, who argued
that the nascent Internet would fundamentally transform warfare. The
idea seemed fanciful at the time, and it took more than a decade for
members of the U.S. national security establishment to catch on. But
once they did, a chorus of voices resounded in the mass media,
proclaiming the dawn of the era of cyberwar and warning of its
terrifying potential. In February 2011, then CIA Director Leon Panetta
warned Congress that "the next Pearl Harbor could very well be a
cyberattack." And in late 2012, Mike McConnell, who had served as
director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush, warned
darkly that the United States could not "wait for the cyber equivalent
of the collapse of the World Trade Centers."

Yet [[the hype about everything "cyber" has obscured three basic
truths]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[cyberwar has never happened in the
past]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it is not occurring in the
present]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and it is highly unlikely that it will
disturb the future.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed, rather than heralding a
new era of violent conflict, so far the cyber-era has been defined by
the opposite trend: a computer-enabled assault on political violence.
[[Cyberattacks diminish]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than accentuate
[**[political violence by making it easier for states, groups, and
individuals to engage in two kinds of aggression that do not rise to the
level of war]{.mark}**:]{.underline} sabotage and espionage. Weaponized
computer code and computerbased sabotage operations make it possible to
carry out highly targeted attacks on an adversary's technical systems
without directly and physically harming human operators and managers.
Computer-assisted attacks make it possible to steal data without placing
operatives in dangerous environments, thus reducing the level of
personal and political risk.

[[These developments represent]{.underline}]{.mark} important changes in
the nature of political violence, but they also highlight [[limitations
inherent in cyberweapons]{.underline}]{.mark} that greatly curtail the
utility of cyberattacks. Those limitations seem to make it difficult to
use cyberweapons for anything other than one-off, hard-to-repeat
sabotage operations of questionable strategic value that might even
prove counterproductive. And cyber-espionage often requires improving
traditional spycraft techniques and relying even more heavily on human
intelligence. Taken together, these factors call into question the very
idea that computer-assisted attacks will usher in a profoundly new era.

#### Cyber attacks prevent escalation. 

Mitchell **Orenstein 22**, Foreign Policy Research Institute Senior
Fellow (Mitchell Orenstein, 6-7-22, "Russia's Use of Cyberattacks:
Lessons from the Second Ukraine War." Foreign Policy Research Institute
https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/06/russias-use-of-cyberattacks-lessons-from-the-second-ukraine-war/)//CT

Of course, Russia also deploys cyberattacks in the absence of planned
military action. Examples include Moscow's cyberattacks against Estonian
banks, government ministries, and parliament in 2007 and on the 2016 US
presidential election. In these instances, the attacks seriously
disrupted the politics of both countries. Russia did not rely on
cyberattacks alone, but accompanied them with other disruptive methods,
such as civil actions, protests, and disinformation campaigns.
Nevertheless, in these instances, Russia did not seek to provoke a
shooting war.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes [[uses cyberattacks]{.mark} not
to disable critical infrastructure [to]{.mark} pave the way for military
conquest, but as part of a comprehensive strategy of [disrupt]{.mark}ion
to degrade [enemy capabilities without provoking
retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such cases, [[Russia has deployed
cyberattacks less frequently]{.underline}]{.mark}, but persistently over
time, and these include destructive attacks. The Second Ukraine War may
cause the West and its allies to take these "hybrid" or "political" war
attacks more seriously, since they so obviously parallel Russian actions
in wartime. 

[[Russia's 2007 cyberattack on Estonia,]{.mark} for
instance]{.underline}, [[sought to prevent the relocation of a
Soviet-era monument commemorating the Red Army's "liberation" of
Estonia]{.underline}]{.mark}. For many Estonians, the monument
represented the Soviet Union's decades-long subjugation of the country
during the Cold War. For Russia, on the other hand, it was a symbol of
Soviet sacrifice in defeating the Nazis in World War II.

When diplomacy failed, cyberattacks began. A few weeks after Estonia
decided to relocate the Soviet-era statue from the center of Tallinn to
a military cemetery, unidentified hackers launched a series of
distributed denial-of-service attacks. [[These attacks against the
Estonian government and information systems, coinciding with escalating
protests by Russian-speaking Estonians**, lasted 22
days.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The denial of service perpetrators went as
far as to spread tutorial pages---in Russian---on when and how to launch
cyberattacks. The situation reached its height when Estonia's ambassador
to Russia was attacked during a press conference in Moscow. The
combination of a disinformation campaign, staged protests, and
cyberattacks created anxiety and disillusionment among the
Russian-speaking Estonian population.

Similarly, Russian cyberattacks contributed to an atmosphere of
distrust, polarization, and social fragmentation in the 2016 US
presidential election. A group of 12 Russian military officers
gained unauthorized access into the computers of the Democratic National
Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign, the Hillary Clinton
campaign, and two Republican candidates, and then disseminated the
information online. This cyberattack not only damaged the victims'
chances of winning the election, but contributed to Americans'
alreadycx-declining faith in democratic institutions. During the
election, a Pew Research Survey found that only 20 percent of the
American population expressed trust in democracy, a staggering figure
for a country seen as the leader of the free world.

In Estonia in 2007 and in the United States in 2016, Russian government
actors used cyberattacks not to prepare an imminent violent attack, but
rather to weaken an unfriendly nation by infiltrating its politics and
undermining trust in democratic institutions. [[Russia, in these
instances, combines cyberattacks with disinformation campaigns and civil
actions, rather than military ones.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Cyberattacks are good for cybersecurity 

Keren L G **Snider et al. 21**, Academic Researchers (Keren L G Snider,
Ryan Shandler, Shay Zandani, and Daphna Canetti, 10-7-21, "Cyberattacks,
cyber threats, and attitudes toward cybersecurity policies." Journal of
Cybersecurity
https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/7/1/tyab019/6382745)//CT

Does exposure to cyberattacks influence public support for intrusive
cybersecurity policies? How do perceptions of cyber threats mediate this
relationship? While past research has demonstrated how exposure to
cyberattacks affects political attitudes, the mediating role played by
threat perception has been overlooked. This study employs a controlled
randomized survey experiment design to test the effect of exposure to
lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks on support for different types of
cybersecurity policies. One thousand twenty-two Israeli participants are
exposed to scripted and simulated television reports of lethal or
nonlethal cyberattacks against national infrastructure. **[[Findings
suggest that exposure to cyberattacks leads to greater support for
stringent cybersecurity regulations, through a mechanism of threat
perception]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Results also indicate that different
types of exposure relate to heightened support for different types of
regulatory policies.]{.underline} [**[People exposed to lethal
cyberattacks tend to support cybersecurity policies that compel the
government to alert citizens about cyberattacks]{.mark}**. People who
were exposed to nonlethal attacks, on the other hand, tend to support
oversight policies at higher levels]{.underline}. More broadly, our
**[research suggests that peoples' willingness to accept government
cybersecurity policies that limit personal civil liberties and privacy
depends on the type of cyberattacks to which they were exposed and the
perceptions associated with such exposure.]{.underline}**

In recent years, the increase in civilian exposure to cyberattacks has
been accompanied by heightened demands for governments to introduce
comprehensive cybersecurity policies. **[[These demands
peaked]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the aftermath of the 2021 **[[Colonial
Pipeline and SolarWinds cyberattacks, where the US government\'s lack of
access to cybersecurity information in critical industries wrought havoc
on the country\'s national and economic security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
In the aftermath of these attacks, lawmakers and the public exhibited
newfound enthusiasm for legislation that would mandate cyberattack
reporting by private enterprises---accelerating a regulatory trend that
has existed for several years \[[[1]{.underline}](about:blank)\]. In
2020, for example, 40 US states and territories introduced more than 280
cybersecurity related bills and resolutions
\[[[2]{.underline}](about:blank), [[3]{.underline}](about:blank)\]. A
similar process has taken place in Europe
\[[[4]{.underline}](about:blank)\] and in Israel
\[[[5]{.underline}](about:blank), [[6]{.underline}](about:blank)\].

[The public willingness to accept government policies and regulations
that limit personal civil liberties and privacy is part of a delicate
tradeoff between security and privacy]{.underline}. In some ways,
privacy is seen as an adequate cost of enhanced personal and societal
security in the face of novel threats. However, the public has grown
increasingly sensitive to the importance of online privacy, and is
keenly aware of the ethical, political, legal, and rights-based dilemmas
that revolve around government monitoring of online activity and
communications
\[[[7]{.underline}](about:blank), [[8]{.underline}](about:blank)\].

The debate on digital surveillance centers on how and whether
authorities should gain access to encrypted materials, and raise key
questions concerning the extent of state interference in civic life, and
the protection of civil rights in the context of security. Yet what lies
at the heart of this willingness to accept government policies and
regulations that limit personal civil liberties and privacy via
increasing public demand for government intervention in cybersecurity?
[Does [exposure to different types of cyberattacks lead to heightened
support for different types of regulatory policies]{.mark}?]{.underline}
And does the public differentiate between interventionist and regulatory
forms of cybersecurity policies?

To test these questions, we ran a controlled randomized survey
experiment that exposed 1022 Israeli participants to simulated video
news reports of lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks. We argue that public
support for governmental cybersecurity measures rises as a result of
exposure to different forms of cyberattacks, and that perceived threat
plays a mediating role in this relationship. More specifically, we
propose that exposure to initial media reports about cyberattacks is a
key to the exposure effect, since at this time the threat is magnified
and the public has minimal information about the identity of the
attacker and the type of cyberattack that was conducted. Past events
show that in many cases, the public internalizes the details of an
attack in its immediate aftermath when media reports are heaviest. While
later reports in the days and weeks following an attack will include far
more detailed information, the damage by this time has already been done
and the public is already scared and alert.

[Further to this, we suggest that the literature has erroneously pooled
together all cyber regulatory policies under a single banner of
cybersecurity. **[We propose that civilian exposure to different types
of cyberattacks leads to increased support for different and specific
cybersecurity policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We therefore
differentiate between support for policies that focus on alerting the
public in cases of cyberattacks and others that call for oversight of
cybersecurity. [In examining how exposure to **[cyberattacks influences
support for these specific policy positions, we distinguish between the
outcome of cyberattacks]{.mark}**---lethal attacks that cause lethal
consequences as a first- or second-degree outcome of the attack, versus
nonlethal attacks that merely involve financial
consequences]{.underline}. This more nuanced breakdown of exposure types
and policy options can help officials contend with certain policy
debates without the need for a one-size-fits-all policy. For example,
reservations expressed by conservative/libertarian scholars who are
concerned about government intervention in the commercial marketplace
need not disqualify all forms of cybersecurity policy
\[[[9]{.underline}](about:blank)\]. Likewise, the reservations of those
concerned with individual privacy violations need not lead to the
denunciation of all policies \[[[10]{.underline}](about:blank)\].

To ground this analysis of how the public responds following exposure to
both lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks, we apply theories associated
with the literature on terrorism and political violence. These theories
offer sophisticated mechanisms that explain how individual exposure to
violence translates into political outcomes---including demands for
government intervention and policymaking. This approach is especially
applicable in the digital realm as cyberattacks track a middle ground
between technological breakthroughs that constitute tactical
developments and new strategic weapons
\[[[11]{.underline}](about:blank)\]. The consequence of such ambiguity
is that civilians who are exposed to digital political threats can only
identify the outcomes of the attack---i.e. whether it is a lethal or
nonlethal cyberattack---while the motivations and identities of
attackers often remain veiled, or at least unsettled. In light of these
attributional challenges, and reflecting the fact that the public
typically operates in a low-information environment, we refrain from
declaring that the cyberattacks that appear in our experimental
manipulations are cybercrime, cyberterrorism, cyber-vandalism, or any
other type of attack. [Rather, we refer to all attacks under the general
heading of \"cyberattacks,\" leaving all respondents to react to the
attacks in a way that they see as appropriate in light of the severity
of the reported outcome.]{.underline}

### Cyber War \-\-- No Impact

#### [NO FOLLOW-ON ESCALATION. EMPIRICS PROVE.]{.underline} 

Martin **Libicki** **14** Martin Libicki is an American scholar and

The assumption that cyberwar is a cool war also rests on the presumption
that [[what starts in cyberspace will stay in
cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}; there will be no escalation into
kinetic conflict. Clearly the chance of escalation that crosses domains
is greater than zero, but [[for cyber war to lose its cool status
requires that the risks of escalation into kinetic
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} for a cyberattack [[be substantially less
than]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[risks associated with a comparable
kinetic attack.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The thin [[history]{.underline}]{.mark} we have of cyberattacks [[does
not suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[a cyberattack will necessarily
be followed by much of anything at all.]{.underline}]{.mark} The
[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}\[11\] [[2007 attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
on Estonia which crippled public and major private web sites was
followed by Estonia's complaints and NATO's unwillingness to deem this
an Article V attack (triggering collective self-defense measures) but it
[[led to nothing violent or even close.]{.underline}]{.mark}\[12\] If
[[Georgia]{.underline}]{.mark} had reacted kinetically to the
cyberattacks on it [[in 2008]{.underline}]{.mark}, it would have been
difficult to distinguish such actions from the war Georgia was forced to
fight following its invasion by Russian forces. The [2007 Israeli air
strike]{.underline} on a purported nuclear facility in Syria may have
been facilitated by an opening cyberattack on Syrian air defenses but
[[Syria did not respond]{.underline}]{.mark} at all [[to the cyberattack
or the raid itself.]{.underline}]{.mark} Iran did not react kinetically
to Stuxnet, even if it created cyberwar cadres that may have been
implicated in carrying out denial-of-service attacks on banks\[13\] in
the United States (from whence, supposedly, Stuxnet), but also attacks
which trashed computers in Saudi Arabia (specifically, Aramco\[14\]) and
Qatar (specifically, RasGas\[15\]), neither of which could be plausibly
accused of complicity in creating Stuxnet. Similarly, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[carried
out no]{.underline}]{.mark} kinetic [[attack]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in
response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the aforementioned denial-of-service
[[attacks on bank]{.underline}]{.mark}s that its intelligence community
ascribed to Iran.

To be fair, cyberattacks unaccompanied by the outbreak of war are easier
to liken to a raid than a war. In a raid, forces cross borders, wreak
their mischief, and go home. In a war, they intend to stay permanently
or turn what they have taken (be it territory or the entire country)
over to those they deem their allies. [[It is very difficult of conceive
of a cyberattack that can change the head of state and even harder to
conceive of one that can conquer all or even part of another
country.]{.underline}]{.mark} In worst-case scenarios, a cyberattack can
disrupt life and maybe even break some machines. But [[they do not
persist]{.underline}]{.mark} unless the cost of eradicating them -- for
instance, by doing a system reboot, or replacing infected machines with
uninfected machines -- exceeds the cost of tolerating their presence. It
is worth remembering that there is no forced entry in cyberspace. Almost
all wars tend to be two-side engagements because the attacked side has
no option but to fight or surrender. In a raid, there is a third option
to offer, at most, some resistance but not pursue the attacker for fear
of worse. Thus, not all raids lead to counter-raids. The aforementioned
2007 Israeli raid on Syria did not. The many U.S. drone strikes have
not, so far. China invaded Vietnam in 1979, wreaked damage, caused
casualties, and departed having, in its mind, taught Vietnam a lesson.
Vietnam did not return the favor by invading China. Neither did India in
1962 under similar circumstances. Granted, some nations do respond.
Arabs and Israelis traded raids in the decade or so after Israel
declared independence (1948); Palestinians and Israelis traded attacks
over the last three decades, as well. Both Koreas sent raiding parties
across the 38th parallel in the years prior to North Korea's
1950 invasion. The history of raids escalating into open conflict (as
distinguished from raids preceding open conflict as was the Korean case)
is also thin.

Two [[other difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with
attribution and the difficulties of disarming the attacker are likely to
reduce the pressure to retaliate, much less, escalate in response to a
cyberattack. Difficulties of attribution are likely to have two related
effects. [[The first is that the target may not be]{.underline}]{.mark}
so [[certain]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[who did
it]{.underline}]{.mark} -- or at least not be certain of its ability to
convince third parties such as other countries who did it -- [[to
validate a response. The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[second is that if it
takes too much time]{.underline}]{.mark} to analyze the attack to the
point where it can determine (and make the case about) who did it with
the requisite confidence, [[the political pressure for vengeance may
have cooled]{.underline}]{.mark} and the politico-military situation
that warranted retaliation may have changed (e.g., yesterday's foe might
be today's partner).

The [[impetus to respond can also be reduced if the public has little
idea]{.underline}]{.mark} about the identity of the attacker and even
the fact of the attack (e.g., the failure to function is not obvious to
the outside). Until the New York Times reported on Stuxnet, the public
did not know that Iran had been attacked (it is not clear whether anyone
in Iran actually understood that they were being attacked before it was
reported). [[If no one knows]{.underline}]{.mark} that two parties are
trading blows in the dark, [[there is much less requirement to appear
strong as a way of establishing third-party
deterrence.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The difficulty of disarming the other side's cyberwar capabilities
removes another reason for responding to a cyberattack. A kinetic
response to a kinetic attack can be justified, not only as a way to
reinforce deterrence, but also as a way to reduce the attacker's ability
to carry out further attacks; it does so by killing opposing forces and
destroying military equipment, ancillary supplies and infrastructure,
especially staging areas. [[A cyber response can only be justified in
terms of deterrence because it is very difficult for a cyberattack to
permanently or even temporarily damage the other side's
ability]{.underline}]{.mark} to carry out cyberattacks, which require
little more than hackers, information, computing equipment, software,
and network
connections.[\[16\]](file:///fichiers/Affaires_Publiques_et_Communication/FIC2014/Contributions/Panneaux/contribution/Libicki_Martin_article.docx#_ftn16) Granted,
the target country may conclude that it may win some relief from
cyberattack by carrying out a kinetic attack on the attacker's cyberwar
corps. Such actions cannot be ruled
out[\[17\]](file:///fichiers/Affaires_Publiques_et_Communication/FIC2014/Contributions/Panneaux/contribution/Libicki_Martin_article.docx#_ftn17) ---
but suffice it to say that at least the tools of a cyberattack cannot be
identified from afar in the same way that the tools of a kinetic attack
can be. Alternatively, the target can convince itself that the only way
to rid itself of the cyberattack menace is to change the regime that
governs the attacking country. If the sole aim of such logic is to
minimize the likelihood of future damage to the target country, it can
be convincing only by substantially underestimating the cost and risk of
war or substantially overestimating the inconvenience associated with
adopting other measures to improve cyber-security.

One reason discussions about cyberwar have become disconnected from
reality is that many commentators fail to grapple with a basic question:
What counts as warfare? Carl von Clausewitz, the nineteenth century
Prussian military theorist, still offers the most concise answer to that
question. Clausewitz identified [[three main criteria that
any]{.underline}]{.mark} aggressive or defensive [[action must meet in
order to qualify as an act of war. First]{.underline}]{.mark}, and most
simply, [[all]{.underline}]{.mark} acts of [[war are
violent]{.underline}]{.mark} or potentially violent.
[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, an act of [[war is always
instrumental]{.underline}]{.mark}: physical violence or the threat of
force is a means to compel the enemy to accept the attacker's will.
[[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, to qualify as an act of war, [[an attack
must have some]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of political
[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark} or intention. For that reason, acts of war
must be attributable to one side at some point during a confrontation.

[[No known cyberattack has met all three of those
criteria]{.underline}]{.mark}; indeed, very few have met even one.
Consider three incidents that today's Cassandras frequently point to as
evidence that warfare has entered a new era. The first of these, a
massive pipeline explosion in the Soviet Union in June 1982, would count
as the most violent cyberattack to date-if it actually happened.
According to a 2004 book by Thomas Reed, who was serving as a staffer on
the U.S. National Security Council at the time of the alleged incident,
a covert U.S. operation used rigged software to engineer a massive
explosion in the Urengoy-Surgut- Chelyabinsk pipeline, which connected
Siberian natural gas fields to Europe. Reed claims that the CIA managed
to insert malicious code into the software that controlled the
pipeline's pumps and valves. The rigged valves supposedly resulted in an
explosion that, according to Reed, the U.S. Air Force rated at three
kilotons, equivalent to the force of a small nuclear device.

But aside from Reed's account, there is hardly any evidence to prove
that any such thing happened, and plenty of reasons to doubt that it
did. After Reed published his book, Vasily Pchelintsev, who was
reportedly the KGB head of the region when the explosion was supposed to
have taken place, denied the story. He surmised that Reed might have
been referring to a harmless explosion that happened not in June but on
a warm April day that year, caused by pipes shifting in the thawing
ground of the tundra. Moreover, no Soviet media reports from 1982
confirm that Reed's explosion took place, although the Soviet media
regularly reported on accidents and pipeline explosions at the time.
What's more, given the technologies available to the United States at
that time, it would have been very difficult to hide malicious software
of the kind Reed describes from its Soviet users.

Another incident often related by promoters of the concept of cyberwar
occurred in Estonia in 2007. After Estonian authorities decided to move
a Soviet-era memorial to Russian soldiers who died in World War II from
the center of Tallinn to the city's outskirts, outraged Russian-speaking
Estonians launched violent riots that threatened to paralyze the city.
The riots were accompanied by cyber-assaults, which began as crude
disruptions but became more sophisticated after a few days, culminating
in a "denial of service" attack. Hackers hijacked up to 85,000 computers
and used them to overwhelm 58 Estonian websites, including that of the
country's largest bank, which the attacks rendered useless for a few
hours.

Estonia's defense minister and the country's top diplomat pointed their
fingers at the Kremlin, but they were unable to muster any evidence. For
its part, the Russian government denied any involvement. In the wake of
the incident, Estonia's prime minister, Andrus Ansip, likened the attack
to an act of war. "What's the difference between a blockade of harbors
or airports of sovereign states and the blockade of government
institutions and newspaper websites?" he asked. It was a rhetorical
question, but the answer is important: unlike a naval blockade, [[the
disruption of websites is not violent-indeed, not even potentially
violent.]{.underline}]{.mark} The choice of targets also seemed
unconnected to the presumed tactical objective of forcing the government
to reverse its decision on the memorial. And unlike a naval blockade,
the attacks remained anonymous, without political backing, and thus
unattributable.

A year later, a third major event entered the cyber-Cassandras'
repertoire. In August 2008, the Georgian army attacked separatists in
the province of South Ossetia. Russia backed the separatists and
responded militarily. The prior month, in what might have been the first
time that an independent cyberattack was launched in coordination with a
conventional military operation, unknown attackers had begun a campaign
of cyber-sabotage, defacing prominent Georgian websites, including those
of the country's national bank and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and
launching denial-of-service attacks against the websites of Georgia's
parliament, its largest commercial bank, and Georgian news outlets. The
Georgian government blamed the Kremlin, just as the Estonians had done.
But Russia again denied sponsoring the attacks, and a NATO investigation
later found "no conclusive proof" of who had carried them out.

The attack set off increasingly familiar alarm bells within American
media and the U.S. national security establishment. "The July attack may
have been a dress rehearsal for an all-out cyberwar," an article in The
New York Times declared. Richard Clarke, a former White House
cybersecurity czar, warned that the worst was yet to come: the Georgian
attack did not "begin to reveal what the Russian military and
intelligence agencies could do if they were truly on the attack in
cyberspace." [[Yet the actual effects of these nonviolent events were
quite mild.]{.underline}]{.mark} The main damage they caused was to the
Georgian government's ability to communicate internationally, thus
preventing it from getting out its message at a critical moment. But
even if the attackers intended this effect, it proved short-lived:
within four days after military confrontations had begun in earnest, the
Georgian Foreign Ministry had set up an account on Google's blog-hosting
service. This move helped the government keep open a channel to the
public and the news media. What the Internet took away, the Internet
returned.

**In Code We Trust?**

Perhaps the [[strongest evidence presented by
advocates]{.underline}]{.mark} of the concept of
[[cyberwar]{.underline}]{.mark} is the S[[tuxnet operation launched
against Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} by the United States and Israel.
Stuxnet, part of a set of attacks known as Operation Olympic Games,
[[was a sophisticated multiyear campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} to
sabotage Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz by inserting a
harmful computer worm into the software that ran the facility's
centrifuges, causing them to overload. American and Israeli developers
started designing the project as early as 2005, and it launched in 2007,
growing more sophisticated until its discovery in 2010. The attack was
groundbreaking in several ways. The developers built highly
target-specific intelligence into the code, enabling the Stuxnet
software to make autonomous decisions in its target environment. Most
important, [[Stuxnet represented the first and only physically
destructive cyberattack launched by one state]{.underline}]{.mark} (or,
in this case, two states) against another.

[[Yet even cyberattacks that cause damage do so only
indirectly.]{.underline}]{.mark} As an agent of violence, computer code
faces a very basic limit: it does not have its own force or energy.
Instead, any cyberattack with the goal of material destruction or
harming human life must utilize the force or energy embedded in its
target: for example, shutting down an air traffic control system and
causing trains or planes to crash or disrupting a power plant and
sparking an explosion. Yet besides Stuxnet, [[there is no proof that
anyone has ever successfully launched a major attack of this
sort.]{.underline}]{.mark} Lethal cyberattacks, while certainly
possible, remain the stuff of fiction: [[none has ever killed or even
injured a single human being.]{.underline}]{.mark} Thanks to its lack of
direct physical impact, code-induced violence also has less emotional
impact. It would be difficult for a cyberattack to produce the level of
fear that coordinated campaigns of terrorism or conventional military
operations produce.

Owing to their invisibility, cyberweapons also lack the symbolic power
of traditional ones. Displays of weaponry, such as the elaborate
military parades put on by China and North Korea, sometimes represent
nothing more than nationalist pageantry. But [[revealing one's arsenal
can also serve tactical]{.underline}]{.mark} and strategic
[[ends]{.underline}]{.mark}, as when countries deploy aircraft carriers
to demonstrate their readiness to use force or carry out operations
designed to intimidate the enemy, such as using military aircraft to
conduct deliberately low flyovers. Indeed, [[displaying weapons
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} and threatening to use them
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} [[prove more cost-efficient than their actual
use. But cyberweapons are hard to brandish.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### [NO IMPACT AND IT'S REVERSIBLE. UKRAINE PROVES.]{.underline}

Thomas **Johansmeyer** **23**. Thomas Johansmeyer is a Ph.D. in
International Conflict Analysis at the University of Kent, and

<https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/01/theres-one-key-advantage-when-it-comes-to-cyber-attacks>
//PK

- The conflict in Ukraine saw fewer cyber attacks than anticipated and
  more kinetic strikes.

- The absence of a heavy cyber dynamic to the conflict is due to the
  lack of impact inflicted by such attacks, despite popular belief about
  the scale of their potential danger.

- Reversibility of cyber attacks is one limit to the risk they pose
  although their threat can still be significant particularly when
  combined with other forms of engagement.

[[The conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} has, in many ways,
[[defied expectations]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially [[for the cyber
security community.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The "[[cyber war]{.underline}]{.mark}" that many expected failed to
materialize as these
operations [[[failed](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/12/16/russia-s-wartime-cyber-operations-in-ukraine-military-impacts-influences-and-implications-pub-88657) to
levy any strategic impact,]{.underline}]{.mark} and the cyber domain of
Russia's offensive has largely been relegated to the background.

Likewise, while the Ukrainian "IT Army" provided captivating headlines,
the international and Ukrainian voluntary hackers that purport to help
the national defence ministry to target Russian infrastructure and
websites have shown to offer no more than marginal contributions. The
conflict has remained predominantly kinetic, and that seems unlikely to
change.

However, this outcome raises a simple but important question. Why hasn't
cyber played a greater role in the conflict in Ukraine? The answer could
provide insight into future conflicts where there's a concern about
outsized cyber engagement or other forms of hybrid warfare.

The debate on the role of cyber in conflict is not new; but its "Pearl
Harbour moment" is yet to occur. Political scientist [Thomas
Rid](https://www.csl.army.mil/SLET/mccd/CyberSpacePubs/Cyber%20War%20Will%20Not%20Take%20Place%20by%20Thomas%20Rid.pdf) says
"cyber war" hasn't happened and isn't likely, while another scholar in
the space, [Lorenzo
Franchesci-Biccherai](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88qgqz/ukraines-decentralized-cyber-army),
says such a term is "used in the wrong situations" and likely to result
in "hyperbole."

There is little precedent to challenge Rid's and Franchesci-Biccherai's
views. Only a handful of cyber operations have captured the public's
attention -- e.g. [Operation Olympic
Games](https://securityanddefence.pl/Operation-Olympic-Games-nCyber-sabotage-as-a-tool-of-American-nintelligence-aimed,121974,0,2.html) directed
at Iranian nuclear facilities and [Operation Glowing
Symphony](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763545811/how-the-u-s-hacked-isis) against
terror outfit ISIS -- but there is no clear instance of moving the
needle as part of a hybrid warfare approach, let alone by themselves.

**Reversible cyber attacks**

Frankly, [[cyber attacks don't have much impact]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
counterintuitive as that may feel, [[given oft-cited catastrophic-level
scenarios such as]{.underline}]{.mark} the potential [[hacking of
nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s or]{.underline}]{.mark} complete
[[disruption of the financial system.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Even
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the latter [[were possible, the fundamental
limitation of cyber operations would soon be realized
-- [reversibility](https://sofrep.com/news/cyber-warfare-hasnt-made-sense-in-ukraine-and-likely-wont-anywhere-else/).]{.underline}]{.mark}

The major difference between cyber operations and their kinetic
alternatives is that [[when kinetic attacks occur, what goes down is
more likely to stay down for longer]{.underline}]{.mark}. To appreciate
this point, it helps to look at reversibility -- or permanence -- of
attacks along a spectrum.

[[At one end is the permanence of nuclear attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Physical or kinetic attacks can have varying degrees of permanence. For
example, significant damage to buildings from artillery strikes can take
years to remedy, particularly if a conflict persists for years and the
number of structures to be repaired increases. Even small arms damage
may last a while]{.underline}, as evident in the Bosnian cities of
Mostar or Sarajevo. The scale of damage itself can impede repair (and
reduce reversibility).

[**[Cyber]{.mark}**, on the other hand, **[has proven to be relatively
reversible.]{.mark}** [For example, Colonial Pipeline]{.mark}, the
largest US oil pipeline, which was subject to a ransomware attack in May
2021, [was down for only [five
days](https://saisreview.sais.jhu.edu/insurance-instead-of-deterrence-a-pivot-in-cybersecurity-strategy/),
compared to several [wind
farms](https://thebulletin.org/2022/04/damage-to-ukraines-renewable-energy-sector-could-surpass-1-billion/) in
Ukraine]{.mark} that experienced physical damage, [affected for
months]{.mark} so far and maybe longer yet as the conflict
continues.]{.underline}

[[The argument could be made that cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} operations
[[are an economic]{.underline}]{.mark} security
[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than a military one, resulting in
the opportunity for indirect warfare. [[However, data from the conflict
in Ukraine casts doubt on this]{.underline}]{.mark} position.

As a reference point, the CEO of cleantech company IB Centre
Inc., [Vitaliy
Daviy](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/05/02/ukraine-is-there-a-pessimistic-solar-scenario-no/),
suggests that the conflict has caused 60% of Ukraine's industrial
enterprises to be shut down or destroyed, with [Kosatka
Media](https://kosatka.media/en/category/vozobnovlyaemaya-energia/news/zelenaya-energetika-v-ukraine-razrushena-voynoy-i-na-grani-bankrotstva-chto-dalshe) estimating
that 30-40% of renewable energy capacity has been damaged.

"It has become clear that the threat posed by cyber operations is
different from what was expected before the conflict in Ukraine. Of
course, this doesn't mean that cyber poses no threat or that cyber risks
can be downplayed."

--- Thomas Johansmeyer, Head of Property Claim Services (PCS), Verisk

Further,[ [[PCS]{.mark}](https://www.verisk.com/insurance/products/property-claim-services/)]{.underline},
the team I lead at data and analytics firm Verisk, estimates that cyber
is likely to [[account for [less than
1%](https://www.reinsurancene.ws/ukraine-conflict-insurance-industry-loss-pcs/) of
industry-wide insured losses]{.underline}]{.mark} from the conflict --
with the bulk coming from such classes as marine, energy and industrial.
Finally, economic losses from physical damage could be as high as \$127
billion, according to the [Kyiv School of
Economics](https://kse.ua/about-the-school/news/the-total-amount-of-damage-caused-to-ukraine-s-infrastructure-is-more-than-127-billion-kse-institute-s-report-as-of-september-2022/).

[[The reversibility of cyber attacks needs to become a fundamental
consideration in cyber security.]{.underline}]{.mark} That applies
whether we are talking about a cyber warfare campaign or an individual
and independent attack against a commercial target.

#### [NO REAL THREATS.]{.underline}

James Andrew **Lewis** **11** James Andrew Lewis is a senior fellow and
director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. "Cyber Attacks,
Real or Imagined, and Cyber War"
<https://www.csis.org/analysis/cyber-attacks-real-or-imagined-and-cyber-war>
//PK

Assorted "cyber attacks" have attracted much attention in the past few
months. One headline in this genre recently proclaimed "Anonymous
Declares War on Orlando." This is wrong on so many levels that it almost
defies analysis. A more precise accounting would show that [[there have
been no cyber wars and perhaps two or three cyber
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} since the Internet first appeared.\
\
The most ironic example of hyperbole catching itself involves the new
Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, which says that the United States
reserves the right to use military force in response to a cyber attack.
Since [[many reports call everything]{.underline}]{.mark}---pranks,
embarrassing leaks, fraud, bank robbery, and espionage---a [[cyber
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}, the strategy led to expressions of concern
that [[the United States would be shooting missiles at annoying teenage
hackers]{.underline}]{.mark} or starting wars over Wikileaks. In fact,
the strategy sets a very high threshold that is derived from the laws of
armed conflict for defining a cyber attack. Nothing we have seen this
year would qualify as an attack using this threshold.\
\
Only by adopting an exceptionally elastic definition of cyber attack can
we say they are frequent. There have been many annoyances, much crime,
and rampant spying, but the only incidents that have caused physical
damage or disruption to critical services are the alleged Israeli use of
cyber attack to disrupt Syrian air defenses and the Stuxnet attacks
against Iran's nuclear facilities. An extortion attempt in Brazil
against a public utility may have backfired and temporarily disrupted
electrical service. A better way to identify an attack is to rely on
"equivalence," where we judge whether a cyber exploit is an attack by
asking if it led to physical damage or casualties. No damage, no
casualties, means no attack.\
\
Many militaries are developing attack capabilities, but this is not some
revolutionary and immensely destructive new form of warfare that any
random citizen or hacker can engage in at will. Nations are afraid of
cyber war and are careful to stay below the threshold of what could be
considered under international law the use of force or an act of war.
Crime, even if state sponsored, does not justify a military response.
Countries do not go to war over espionage. [[There is intense hostile
activity in cyberspace, but it stays below the threshold of
attack.\]{.underline}
]{.mark}\
The denial-of-service efforts against Estonian and Georgian websites in
2007 and 2008 were not attacks. The Estonian incident had a clear
coercive purpose, and it is worth considering whether the
denial-of-service exploit against Estonia could have become the
equivalent of an attack if it had been extended in scope and duration.
The exploits against Georgia, while undertaken with coercive intent and
closely coordinated with Russian military activities (and a useful
indicator of how Russia will use cyber warfare), did no damage other
than to deface government websites.\
\
The recent escapades involving groups like Anonymous or Lulzsec do not
qualify as attacks. Anonymous and Lulzsec did not disrupt critical
operations of the companies or agencies they struck. There was
embarrassment, but no damage, destruction, or casualties. These were
political actions---cyber demonstrations and graffiti---spun up by media
attention and copycatting.\
\
Some nations---[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular---[[argue
that political actions are in fact the core of the new kind of
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the issue is really "information
warfare" rather than "cyber warfare." They have said that information is
a weapon and that the United States will exploit the Internet to
destabilize governments it opposes. Information is a threat to
authoritarian regimes, and they want to limit access to websites and
social networks. This effort to extend cyber attack to include access to
information, however, [[makes little sense]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
distorts long-standing ideas on warfare and military action by
disconnecting them from the concept of the use of armed force and
violence. The use of force produces immediate physical harm and is
central to defining attack and warfare. The concept is incorporated in
elements of the UN Charter and the Hague and Geneva Conventions.
Publishing or sharing an idea is not the use of force. Though an
expanded definition of warfare may serve the political interests of
authoritarian regimes, it is not an accurate description of military
action or attack.

### Cyber War Bad \-\-- AT Diplomacy

#### Cyber war doesn't cause diplomacy

China, on the other hand, has been accused of engaging in extensive
intellectual property theft through cyber espionage. The Chinese
government's [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} units have targeted numerous
industries, including [[defence, technology]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
healthcare, to gain a competitive edge. [These actions not only
[undermine economic security]{.mark} but [also strain diplomatic
relations]{.mark}. Cyberterrorism and Non-State Actors [The threat
landscape is not limited to state actors; non-state actors, including
terrorist organisations and criminal syndicates, have also embraced
cyber tactics]{.mark}.]{.underline} Cyberterrorism poses a unique
challenge as terrorist groups leverage the anonymity of the internet to
spread propaganda, recruit members, and coordinate attacks. For
instance, the Islamic State (ISIS) has utilised social media platforms
to radicalise individuals and inspire lone-wolf attacks globally.
Additionally, ransomware attacks by criminal groups have escalated,
targeting hospitals, educational institutions, and businesses. The [2017
WannaCry ransomware attack]{.mark}, attributed to North Korean hackers,
[affected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, causing
widespread disruption]{.mark} and financial losses. [Economic Espionage
and Intellectual Property Theft [Economic espionage]{.mark} and
intellectual property theft represent significant [threats to
international economic stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nation-states and
non-state actors engage in cyber-enabled theft of trade secrets,
proprietary information, and intellectual property to gain competitive
advantages and undermine rival economies. A notable example is the theft
of intellectual property from U.S. companies by Chinese hackers, which
has been estimated to cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars
annually. This persistent threat has prompted calls for stronger
international cooperation and the development of stringent cybersecurity
measures to protect intellectual assets. Impact on International
Relations [[The impact of cyber threats on international relations is
profound, often leading to diplomatic tensions and the erosion of trust
between nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} The attribution of cyberattacks is
a complex and contentious process, with nations frequently denying
involvement despite evidence to the contrary. This ambiguity complicates
the formulation of coherent responses and the establishment of norms in
cyberspace. [[Diplomatic retaliations]{.mark}, such as sanctions and
public condemnations, [have become common responses to
cyberattacks]{.mark}. For example, the [U.S. and its allies have imposed
sanctions on Russia for its cyber activities]{.mark}, leading to a
tit-for-tat escalation. These [measures]{.mark}, while necessary, can
[further strain diplomatic relations and increase the risk of broader
conflicts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Multilateralism

### Multilat Bad

#### P3 veto wielding, [conservative]{.underline} climate [policy]{.underline}, and the ignorance of the WTO render multilateralism [ineffective]{.underline}.

[[Multilat]{.mark}eralism [is retreating]{.mark} and [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[N]{.mark}**ations [is **no longer
effective**]{.mark} in any of its major functions]{.underline}. [The
[fault is with]{.mark}]{.underline} both the First UN of member states
--- and particularly [the [**veto wielding** P3 of Russia, China
and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} --- and the
Second UN of secretariats. More ominously, it is not clear how the UN
could regain its usefulness. In a month, a summit will declare on its
future, but rather than a UN 2.0, the result is more likely to confirm a
UN 0.5, perhaps a "mere footnote" of history.

Many declarations have come and gone. [The [latest pact]{.mark}, devised
for the upcoming Summit of the Future, [contains]{.mark} nearly [60
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Apart from authorizing the UN
secretary-general to take a few minor organizational initiatives,
[nearly [all]{.mark} the "actions" --- like so many previous resolutions
over decades --- [will **fall short**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
[continuing pursuit]{.mark} of perfection [in]{.mark} an
[organization]{.mark} that is still pretending to adhere to an 80
year-old Charter, [originally **developed by** and]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
the prevailing **[postwar West]{.mark}**ern interests, [is
futile]{.mark}.]{.underline} If there were ever a good definition of
"brain dead," we are encountering it in the UN. Attempts in September to
reset, revamp and revisit the organization through yet another pious
declaration will only distract us from global realities. They are not
going away.

[The latest draft of the **Pact for the Future** has 17 actions on peace
and security. Most of them will [depend on]{.mark} the [Security Council
to carry out]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} the [P3]{.mark} powers will continue
to **[veto]{.mark}** [any decisions that **impinge on**]{.mark}
[their]{.mark} national **[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President
Volodymyr [[Zelensky]{.underline}]{.mark} of Ukraine [[called
out]{.mark} the [Security Council]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2022
[when]{.underline} it became obvious that through its full invasion of
his country, [[Russia]{.mark} was [ready to trample over]{.mark}
[every]{.mark} core [principle of the Charter]{.mark} with
impunity]{.underline} ([[and have]{.mark} the ultimate [**hypocrisy** to
**chair** a **Security**]{.mark} [**Council**
discussion]{.mark}]{.underline} on its bombing of civilian
infrastructure).

Action 24 will pursue a "future free from terrorism," but in
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[UN secretariat]{.mark} the responsibility
falls on a department [headed by]{.mark} a [rep]{.mark}resentative
[of]{.mark} that **[same]{.mark}** member [**state** that **perpetrates
terrorist acts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the [US]{.mark} has
[urged]{.mark} the Security [Council to call for]{.mark} a
[ceasefire]{.mark} [in **Gaza** while giving Israel]{.mark} the
[weapons]{.mark} it needs [to destroy]{.mark} the lives and livelihoods
of the [Palestinians]{.mark} there]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} has
[ignored]{.mark} [and virulently opposed]{.mark}]{.underline}
discussions on the findings of a [[UN report on crimes against humanity
in **Xinjiang**]{.mark} Province]{.underline}. More examples are
scarcely needed.

[[Action 1]{.mark} of the pact [will "achieve"]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**ustainable **[D]{.mark}**evelopment
**[G]{.mark}**oal[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark}
this is a waste of words since, according to the UN secretariat, [a mere
[15 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of the targets [are [on track to be
achieved by 2030]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the beginning, the path
toward the 2030 agenda was poorly managed, and the blueprint was far too
complex and ambiguous. One goal, SDG 16, stands out as a precondition
for development but is one of the least likely to be met. As
International IDEA recently concluded, "the evidence reveals that peace,
justice and strong institutions are not merely complementary but
foundational to sustainable development."

[As for climate change]{.underline} and the environment, [[Actions 9 and
10]{.mark} will "[enhance]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[ambition to address
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} and accelerate efforts to protect,
conserve and sustainably use the environment." [After decades of
trying]{.underline}, it is not obvious that solutions will be found
through the UN. Quite the contrary. While the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) has played a role in raising the alarm, [[the
UN]{.mark} has [relied on]{.mark} the Conference of the Parties
([COP]{.mark}) process [to achieve results]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[But]{.mark} the [COPs]{.mark} have been [singularly
ineffective]{.mark} for several reasons]{.underline}. [One is the [UN
secretariat's **timidity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has been far too
indulgent to member states in [[allow]{.mark}ing **[voluntary]{.mark}**
[national targets to reduce]{.mark} carbon
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has permitted petro-states to host
COP meetings, like the United Arab Emirates last year and Azerbaijan
this year, and [it has [failed]{.mark} to [counter]{.mark} the advocacy
by [oil and gas interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Progress]{.mark} is
[measured by]{.mark} slight **[adjustments of
language]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its outcome statements while
[[downplaying]{.mark} [actual outcomes]{.mark} in CO2
emissions]{.underline}.

[[Consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} on COP results [inevitably [leads to
conservative solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} that pander to the positions
of the member states, which are the most resistant to change. The
conclusion of each COP is applauded by the participants, but it can be
argued that the process has faltered and hindered progress. [Funding
acts as a further brake]{.underline}. Without exception, every major
debate in the UN ends up with confrontations concerning finance. The
COPs are no exception. [**[Financial targets]{.mark}** are
[always]{.mark} [missed]{.mark}, providing [further excuses for
inaction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Progress on the climate is made elsewhere, albeit too slowly. Civil
society and other nongovernmental interests are helping to force change,
shaming governments into acting. Shareholders have prevailed on oil
companies to invest in renewable energy. The mayors of 9,000 cities
around the world (C40 Cities) have agreed on a global covenant to
address climate change. In the US, the euphemistically named Inflation
Reduction Act will help, but it is more a response to commercial rivalry
with China than a reaction to the 2015 Paris Agreement.

[**[Trade]{.mark}** provides [**another** example of]{.mark} the
[**failure** of multilat]{.mark}eral [negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Action 5). [The **[WTO]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which has replaced UN
Trade and Development, or UNCTAD, in this function) [[has rules that
are]{.mark} being **[willfully ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
[US]{.mark} has knee-capped the dispute mechanism by [refus]{.mark}ing
to allow the [appointment of judges]{.mark}; the world's largest
exporter, [China]{.mark}, continues to claim developing-country status
and [hides info]{.mark}rmation [on]{.mark} its [trade
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Global trade negotiations began in 2001
in Doha and died in 2015. [Determined multilateralists]{.underline} are
[calling for WTO reform but]{.underline} there is [no sign]{.underline}
that the [changes will happen]{.underline}. There are echoes here of the
ill-fated efforts to change the Security Council.

[[Trade]{.underline}]{.mark} is being [[weaponized through]{.mark}
targeted [tariffs]{.mark}]{.underline}, and countries are pursuing
industrial policies that subsidize domestic production. Yet, trade
negotiations are as active as ever, just not global in scope. [With
average global tariff levels now below 10 percent, **[free
trade]{.mark}** agreements are [becoming]{.mark}
**[rare]{.mark}**r]{.underline}. [The [emphasis]{.mark} is [on nontariff
barriers]{.mark}]{.underline} of various kinds, including trade
facilitation, [which [is more resistant to uniform rules]{.mark} and
norms]{.underline}. Today, trade relations are developing bilaterally
and regionally at a rapid rate, with growing numbers of so-called
mini-deals in which pairs or groups of countries agree on specific
mutually advantageous conditions.

#### Multilateralism [fails]{.underline}. It gets [coopted]{.underline} by state's national interest.

//adiiiiG

From the perspective of a world beset by grave global challenges,
effective multilateralism is the Holy Grail. As the sad end of UN
Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid demonstrated, the struggle to
slow climate change cannot be taken forward if multilateral cooperation
fails. Yet [[multilateralism]{.mark} is a **[double-edged
sword]{.mark}**]{.underline}: depending on how it is understood and how
it is practiced, [it can also [degenerate]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} a
substitute for effective action, or even **[subvert international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [first [problem with "multilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}" is what
the term means. At its most elementary, multilateralism simply
[describes forms of diplomacy that involve more than two
parties]{.underline}. A more demanding understanding of multilateralism
defines it as a way in which diplomacy is conducted: to involve relevant
parties in negotiations, and to continue talking until compromise is
achieved. In this definition, multilateralism is about process. More
exacting still is an understanding of multilateralism that focuses on
the context and objective of diplomatic processes: the strengthening of
an international order that is ruled by law, not by force. [This
definition of multilateralism assumes that international diplomacy will
be guided by rules and norms as well as watched over by dedicated
international institutions.]{.underline} Yet this definition begs the
questions: What are the rules and norms that form the basis of
international order? [[Are governments really prepared to follow
them]{.mark}?]{.underline} What, in other words, is the substance around
which the processes of multilateral diplomacy take place?

Only a substantive understanding of multilateralism can engender
sustainable policies

There can be no doubt that the [current U.S. administration's commitment
to the rules and norms of today's international order is
limited]{.underline} and selective; President Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, it seems, [[does not like rules and norms
at]{.mark} [all]{.mark}]{.underline} -- except when they serve his own
interests. Yet it is also somewhat odd to have China's President Xi
Jinping pose (as he famously did at the World Economic Forum in Davos in
February 2017) as the champion of a liberal international order; China's
policies often systematically violate the spirit and even the letter of
that order. The final, and in my view the only adequate, definition of
multilateralism sets the term in the context of the huge demand for, and
the inadequate supply of, global governance. This recognizes a) that
th[e world has a lot to do to secure a good future for
mankind]{.underline}, and b) that this can be achieved only through
broad-based international cooperation and integration. There are simply
too many relevant parties to any of the major global challenges -- from
climate change to arms control and pandemics -- for any unilateral or
bilateral efforts to succeed. Take global warming: even the [two biggest
emitters of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, China and the United States,
[could not contain global warming below 2 degrees on their
own]{.underline}, nor by working together bilaterally. (This is not to
say that their cooperation would be irrelevant; on the contrary, if the
United States and China were able to agree on a joint approach towards
the problem of climate change, they could then bring others on board of
their solution. This is what made the Paris Agreement on Climate Change
at COP 21 possible in 2015).  This understanding of multilateralism
combines process with substance and ambition; implicitly, it also
provides benchmarks to measure the results of multilateral diplomacy.

When Washington, Beijing or Moscow, or even the European Union, today
pose as good multilateralists, [scepticism seems warranted]{.underline}.
Of course, [[all diplomacy,]{.mark} including multilateral diplomacy,
[aims at pursuing]{.mark} "[national interests]{.mark}", that is, the
objectives that governments define for their countries.]{.underline}
Multilateralism therefore is a tool with which parties pursue their own
objectives. Yet only if the respective definitions of what constitutes
the "national interest" include notions of a rules-based international
order and ambitions to tackle transnational challenges effectively, if 
multilateralism becomes an end, not only a means, will national policies
be sustainable. Such a demanding definition of multilateralism implies a
commitment by countries to forego possible short-term advantages for the
sake of protecting the rules, norms and effectiveness of the
international order. Put bluntly, governments need to understand that in
the longer run they have more to gain from following and thus helping to
preserve the rules, than by defying them for the sake of some immediate
benefit.  At present, we observe a [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[government whose commitment]{.mark} to substantive multilateralism in
this sense [is at best selective]{.mark},]{.underline} a
[[Russia]{.mark}n regime that [seems bent to undermine any]{.mark}
substantive [multilateralism that does not conform to its own
ambitions]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} a [Chinese government]{.mark} that,
although committed to a rules-based international order, [wants to
change the rules]{.mark} and control the outcomes.]{.underline} [It is
hardly surprising, therefore, that [multilateralism today often]{.mark}
[degenerates into]{.mark} empty posturing, or even worse: [a mimicry of
effective action]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Yet even if governments were seriously committed to effective
multilateralism in its most demanding form (and even Germany, which
likes to portrait itself as an exemplary multilateralist, in fact has a
rather mixed record on this), multilateralism is far from being a
panacea. On the contrary, it is a highly demanding form of international
diplomacy, with lots of built-in pitfalls that need constant attention
and persistent political efforts to avoid. Thus, [multilateralism is
unwieldy and cumbersome]{.underline}. Its [[agenda tends to
become]{.mark} diffuse and [overcrowded]{.mark}, all the parties
involved have different priorities that they all want to see included in
the outcome]{.underline}. It therefore becomes difficult to set
priorities and avoid being side-tracked from the most important issues.
Multilateral negotiations also take time, sometimes a lot of time; this
intensifies the difficulty of setting (and meeting) deadlines that
reflect objective constraints and the urgency of issues. The outcomes of
multilateral diplomacy usually require implementation by national
governments; this raises issues of monitoring and domestic application
to deliver on national commitments.

As we celebrate International Day of Multilateralism and Diplomacy for
Peace, we are provided with a great opportunity to reflect on
[[multilateralism]{.mark} based on its founding principles such as
consultation, inclusion and solidarity.]{.underline} These principles
are outlined in the UN charter, which remains the [\"moral compass [to
promote peace, advance human]{.mark} [dignity]{.mark},
[prosperity]{.mark} [and uphold human rights and the **rule of
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\"** asSecretary-General António Guterres

[to]{.mark} equitably distribute resources and adequately **[address

remains the uniquely inclusive vehicle for managing mutual

welfare.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The complex challenges of a global
**pandemic, climate emergency, inequality and the risk of nuclear
conflict** cannot be dealt with by one country or one region
alone]{.mark}.]{.underline} Coordinated collective action is required.
Without coordinated and timely collective global action in recent years
to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, global suffering would have been
far greater. Initiatives such as COVAX and the UN's socio-economic
response to COVID-19 not only helped mitigate the public health
emergency, but also help decision-makers look beyond recovery towards
2030, managing complexity and uncertainty. [The devastating war in
Ukraine has been a colossal blow to multilateral efforts by the
international community to maintain peace and prevent major wars.
However, [multilateral cooperation **cannot be declared
obsolete**]{.mark} -- it is crucial in efforts to put human dignity and
planetary health at the heart of cross-border cooperation.]{.underline}
The recent Black Sea Grain Initiative agreement represents a key
testament to the value of multilateral cooperation working even in the
most difficult circumstances, ensuring the protection of those that are
most vulnerable to global shocks. Without this agreement, global food
prices would have risen even further, and vulnerable countries pushed
further into hunger and political unrest.

There is no general agreement on what shape the "world order" will take
in the years and decades ahead. [What is certain, however, is that
humanity will have to deal with huge and in many ways **unprecedented
transformations and challenges**, such as the digitalization of
economies and societies, climate change and mitigation, pandemic
preparedness, extreme income and wealth concentration,1 and new types of
"weapons" associated with dual-use technologies.]{.underline}

There are great opportunities for improved well-being associated with
many of these challenges. [**Digitalization and artificial intelligence
(AI)** could result in tremendous increases in productivity, and the
green transformation necessitated by climate change could constitute the
greatest economic, social, and business opportunity since the industrial
revolution.]{.underline}2 [However, failure to adequately address some
of these challenges, notably **climate change**, could lead to immense
**economic** and **social damage**; it could add to the existing
pressures caused by **mass migration** resulting from the imbalance
between geographic concentrations of populations and economic
opportunities.]{.underline} Furthermore, digitalization could exacerbate
inequalities and lead to mass surveillance of societies led by
autocrats[. In turn, some of the "weapons" that may be developed with
new technologies could lead to a scale of destruction of the planet
tantamount to nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The U.N. Secretary-General
António Guterres starts his new agenda-setting report by stating
"humanity faces a stark and urgent choice: a breakdown or a
breakthrough."3 [Multilateral cooperation is therefore needed more than
ever to both fully realize the potential benefits of these shifting
trends and minimize the dangers that accompany them.]{.underline}

[The [recent flare up]{.mark}]{.underline} in tensions and military
exchange [[between India and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} has world
leaders and strategic thinkers around the globe wiping the sweat from
their brow as two nuclear powers managed to stop themselves moments
before the outbreak of full-scale war. [The night of 9/10th May 2025
will [go down in history as]{.mark} a **[unique moment]{.mark}** in the
annals of modern military history [where]{.mark} [two nuclear armed
nations]{.mark} threw everything they had at one another in the domain
of conventional air power while **[maintain]{.mark}ing [strategic
restraint]{.mark}** regarding their ground forces [and avoid]{.mark}ing
a [direct confrontation]{.mark} along the international
border]{.underline}. As the dust settles, the only question on
everyone's mind is "[how did it come to this]{.underline}?".

\<\<PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED AND SHRUNK\>\>

India and Pakistan's rivalry has, at this point, become a staple of
international politics. To world leaders and foreign audiences, a sharp
increase in tensions between these two countries was not seen as
particularly remarkable; business as usual in South Asia with India and
Pakistan at each other's throats. While, in the aftermath of the
Pahalgam attack, analysts may have predicted some sort of limited
exchange akin to the 2019 Pulwama crisis, even the most pessimistic mind
could not have imagined the intensity of the clash that followed.
Arguably surpassing the Kargil War, this can be considered India and
Pakistan's worst military confrontation since the 1971 war and possibly
the closest the world has come to a nuclear exchange since the Cuban
Missile Crisis in 1962. While military analysts, journalists and
government officials from other countries will spend the next several
months picking this incident apart moment by moment and decision by
decision in order to shed some light on the veracity of each side's
claims, it will be some time before we can determine which side had the
operational edge. Now is the time for reflection. While the threat of
nuclear annihilation is still fresh in our minds, we must determine what
factors on both sides of the border were responsible for allowing the
situation to grow so far out of control. Since the Kargil War, there
hasn't been a major conflict between India and Pakistan aside from the
occasional border stand-off. Due to the presence of a potent nuclear
deterrent on both sides of the border, neither side has been willing to
commit to a military engagement due to the fear of nuclear escalation.
As a result, a new status quo has emerged in the sub-continent wherein,
whenever such a flare up occurs, the international community rushes in
to mediate the issue and find a peaceful resolution. Indeed, we can see
a pattern over the past 25 years where a diplomatic intervention led by
the United States was able to successfully mediate the situation. During
the 2001 stand-off following the attack on the Indian Parliament, which
India claimed was carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba, both sides positioned
their forces on the border. The American Secretary of State, Colin
Powell, initiated diplomatic talks between the two countries which
helped to reduce tensions. A similar situation followed the deadly 2008
Mumbai attack which claimed the lives of 166 Indians, including 6
Americans. While both countries prepared for an armed conflict,
diplomatic involvement by the United States was helpful in preventing an
escalation. Then, in 2019, in the aftermath of the limited exchange
following the Pulwama attack, international mediation was critical in
bringing the crisis to a peaceful resolution.

Now, this is not a claim that foreign powers have always exerted a
positive influence on the sub-continent. From the colonial era to the
Cold War, western interests in South Asia have always been self-serving.
Regardless, due to India and Pakistan's mutual nuclear deterrent, all
the nations in the world have a critical interest in making sure a
conflict between the two does not get out of control. [[Since]{.mark}
the end of the [Cold War]{.mark}, which roughly coincides with the
nuclearization of the sub-continent, [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has been]{.mark} the **[undisputed global
hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this capacity, [it has
[usually]{.mark} led the international effort to [reduce
tensions]{.mark} [and avoid escalation between India and
Pakistan]{.mark}. [However]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} the
**[shift]{.mark}ing** [of]{.mark} the [global power]{.mark} balance
**[towards multipolarity]{.mark}**, [America's]{.mark} diplomatic
[influence]{.mark} has begun to [waver]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Amplified by]{.mark} the White House's geopolitical posturing since
Donald **[Trump's]{.mark}** second inauguration and the initiation of a
**[global trade war]{.mark}**, the rate at which the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates' [soft power diminish]{.mark}es has only
[accelerated]{.mark}, and with it the shift towards
multipolarity]{.underline}. This was evident on 8th May when the Vice
President, [JD [Vance]{.mark}, [claim]{.mark}ed the rising [tensions
were]{.mark} "**[none of our business]{.mark}**" and did not wish for
the United States to get involved]{.underline}. This stance is
[[consistent with]{.mark} Trump's **"[America First]{.mark}"**
[policy]{.mark} [which]{.mark} calls for an [end]{.mark} to the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [role as]{.mark} a [mediator in foreign
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Ultimately]{.mark} the United States did choose to get
involved]{.underline}. Based on some undisclosed "critical
intelligence", the Vice President, accompanied by the Secretary of
State, Marco Rubio, initiated diplomatic talks between India and
Pakistan on 10th May. [[Within]{.mark} less than [48
hours]{.mark}]{.underline}, the situation had deteriorated to such an
extent that the [[Trump]{.mark} [Administration]{.mark} felt forced to
[completely reverse]{.mark} [their stance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This
is]{.mark} the crux of the [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That [delay
of]{.mark} less than [two days will influence]{.mark} the strategic
[landscape]{.mark} of the sub-continent [for
decades]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Over the past 25 years, a norm has emerged between India and Pakistan.
[This [repeated pattern of terrorism]{.mark} in India [followed
by]{.mark} a [limited strike]{.mark} on Pakistan, [which]{.mark} in turn
[causes]{.mark} a [retaliation]{.mark} against India, [is **not
sustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is at this point that we must
address the elephant in the room: the political element of such
incidents. Without delving into the messy domestic politics on either
side of the border, we can build a rough image of the political gains
each side is trying to make by understanding one very simple strategic
principle: when attacked by an external force, the people of a country
will exert pressure on the political class to take action. In a
democratic system, the people can simply vote in the candidate who
promises to take action. In a non-democratic system, the ruler
understands the political legitimacy they receive by defending the
nation against a foreign threat and is incentivized towards aggression.
In either case, we cannot expect the entire population of a country to
have an in-depth understanding of the country's vital strategic
interests or the principles of deterrence theory. We can only expect
them to understand that they have been threatened and to feel positively
inclined towards those they believe guard them from such threats.
Therefore, in the future we can expect that, should a similar incident
occur, the decision making on both sides will be politically influenced.

As mentioned, [this has been [the norm for]{.mark} the past [25
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The reason it [has been]{.mark} relatively
stable is that, in the past, [India and Pakistan]{.mark}'s leaders
[could]{.mark} **[reliably predict]{.mark}** that [**foreign powers**
would]{.mark} rush to [mediate]{.mark} the [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[By [provid]{.mark}ing an "[exit ramp" which either side could take
without suffering]{.mark} [political losses]{.mark} domestically, the
[internat]{.mark}ional [community **disincentivized**]{.mark} the Indian
and Pakistani political [systems]{.mark} from fostering a culture
[of]{.mark} **[strategic restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the use
of nuclear weapons is a red line neither side would consider crossing,
anything below that is an option given the safety net provided by
international mediation.

So, what does the two-day gap in the United States' mediation tell us
about the state of the international system today? One possibility is
that [President Trump is indeed committed to shifting American foreign
policy away from issues that he believes they have no direct stake
in.]{.underline} The other, more likely, possibility is that the
[[Trump]{.mark} Administration]{.underline}, due to its straining of
relations with traditional American allies, [[lacks]{.mark} the
[dip]{.mark}lomatic [cap]{.mark}ital needed [to coordinate]{.mark} an
international effort to bring about a [resolution]{.mark} to such
crises. In such a situation, [**without** a **global hegemon**]{.mark}
[to coordinate efforts]{.mark} and a united power bloc to enforce them,
[individual]{.mark} [countries]{.mark} would find it more beneficial to
simply issue statements and [**formulate** their **own stances**]{.mark}
on the issue [rather than]{.mark} being part of a larger movement to
[diplomatically influence two countries towards
peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the future, the politically influenced leaderships of [[India and
Pakistan]{.mark} may [find themselves]{.mark} [in]{.mark} another
[tit-for-tat]{.mark} situation]{.underline}, [[gradually
retaliating]{.mark} their way up the escalation ladder [until]{.mark}
[they reach]{.mark} a **[point of no return]{.mark}** only [to
find]{.mark} that [the internat]{.mark}ional [system]{.mark}
**[lacks]{.mark}** the [**unipolarity** needed to create]{.mark} a
**[coordinated effort]{.mark}** [which]{.mark} can [successfully
mediate]{.mark} such a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. This shift in the
geopolitical environment, which resulted in a [[delayed]{.mark}
diplomatic [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} by the international
community, is partially responsible for the intensity of the exchange we
witnessed on 9/10th May and [[paints]{.mark} a [dire picture for]{.mark}
the [future of South Asia in]{.mark} a [multipolar
world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Multipolarity Bad \-\-- Ukraine War

#### Multipolarity is the [underlying cause]{.underline} of the Ukraine war.

The declining power of the West and the further interconnectedness
created due to globalisation allows many countries to strategically use
their autonomy to pursue their goals in the global sphere.

[An application of]{.underline} this theoretical background of
[multipolarity to the **current crisis** of the [**Russian aggression**
against Ukraine]{.mark} demands attention and critical mention of
certain events and actions which prove the case on point.]{.underline}
According to the White House's Fact Sheet, "[The United States and more
than 30 allies]{.underline} and partners across the world [have levied
the most impactful, coordinated, and wide-ranging economic restrictions
in history]{.underline}." Countries are now looking for alternatives to
the Russian oil and gas imports. The imposition of economic sanctions is
supposed to circumvent aggressive and ethically questionable actions by
a country. Several multinationals from around the world have suspended
business or have completely withdrawn in the wake of the crisis. Their
response to crisis has been more temporary and short-term in most cases,
allowing them to return in the aftermath of the crisis and removal of
sanctions. [However, in Russia's case, despite heavy sanctioning, it
hasn't surrendered to the global call of halting the war.]{.underline}

Here, the reasons for going to war may provide some ground of
understanding as to why it's also not willing to stop the war. [The war,
while it may be influenced by many developments of today, [finds]{.mark}
its [logic in]{.mark} the [rivalries of the Cold War]{.mark} even though
the immediate cause was to prevent Ukraine from joining the
NATO.]{.underline} The fall of the erstwhile Soviet Union had left a
deep impact on the region. Both Russia and China have joined hands in
countering the West's influence and actions around the world since then.
They have particularly spoken against America's efforts to exclude
nations from becoming influential and for suppressing other nations
through the imbalanced power relations in the global order. [[Russia's
**loss** of]{.mark} its [**exclusive control** of Eastern
Europe]{.mark}, [where countries]{.mark} have [now]{.mark} [harboured
relations with]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} nations and some have joined
the NATO, [has served as]{.mark} the **[reason of]{.mark}** the [current
**crisis**]{.mark}. The [growing presence of NATO]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe makes Russia hesitant of its political and strategic autonomy. It
[makes Russia deal]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [loss of its
heg]{.mark}emony in Eastern Europe [due to]{.mark} the [independence of
these nations]{.mark} [as a result of]{.mark} the end of the Cold War
and the offerings of **[multipolarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What was
shocking to Russia was Ukraine's response to its comparatively
overpowering might and its choice to not surrender to its terms or
rampant formidable acts of violence on its territory.

Russia's loss of its exclusive control of Eastern Europe, where
countries have now harboured relations with the NATO nations and some
have joined the NATO, has served as the reason of the current crisis.

The United States has spoken vehemently against the humanitarian
disasters due to the war and the infringement of a sovereign country's
right to autonomy in action and decision-making. The war helps America
rally the world in its favour by excluding Russia from global trade and
multilateral organisations. It is also in deliberation to relax
sanctions on Venezuela at this moment despite sanctioning it for the
Maduro government's anti-democratic behaviour and the plight of its
citizens due to the denial of basic right to life with dignity. The
sanctions have caused greater harm to the already volatile and
plummeting socio-economic situation in the country. The fact that
America has also chosen to be accepting of India's oil deal with Russia
given its interest to have a major Asian power as a strong ally to
counter China's expansionism in the Indo-Pacific is in contradiction
with its stance on the war. India has also balanced between Russia and
the United States through its strategic diplomacy while calling for
peace and dialogue engagement to end the war.

[Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark} is [suggestive]{.mark} of one
thing in particular [that]{.mark} the global liberal order is under
threat and the [**multiple** centers of **power**]{.mark} have
**[created vulnerable interdependencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
poses the question of whether multipolarity is inherently ridden with
the capacity to create conflict and whether multilateralism has ended up
giving more space to them. If this is true, then is it possible to find
solutions within the form of multipolarity and the actions as well as
the theoretical objectives of multilateralism? However, [it's also
imperative to consider that [multipolarity]{.mark} in itself [poses
threats to multilat]{.mark}eralism. The [biggest failure]{.mark} of
multipolarity can be seen in the ability to gather a united collective
(both of countries and normative/ideological support) against Russia's
aggression. **[National interest]{.mark}** has **[overridden]{.mark}**
any [concerns of **humanitarian crisis**]{.mark} around the
world.]{.underline} While multipolarity, has restrained nations from
acting collectively and surpassing concerns regarding national interest,
can it prove to be a solution for the same? Since multipolarity creates
extensive unignorable dependencies, it can bind nations through the
global supply chains and participation in multilateral organisations.
[This then questions [what]{.mark} sort of [checks]{.mark} and balances

Introducing Minilateralism

[One of the most striking features of this new landscape is the
emergence of **[medium powers]{.mark}** as [**key** players in]{.mark}
the [internat]{.mark}ional [system]{.mark}]{.underline}. [India, Turkey,
Saudi Arabia, Brazil, South Africa, and others today play a much
**bigger role** than they did just 10 or 15 years ago]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the development of [[alt]{.mark}ernative [forms of
internat]{.mark}ional [coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} such as
"**[minilateralism]{.underline}**" is [[becoming
**increasingly**]{.mark} **[important]{.mark}** [in a world where
trad]{.mark}itional [multilat]{.mark}eral [institutions face]{.mark}
[mounting challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Put simply, we are witnessing, or taking part in, a momentous
confrontation where on the one hand the United States is trying to
preserve a unipolar world in which Washington leads several democracies
and on the other hand where China, Russia, and some non-aligned
countries would like to preserve, or recreate, a new, multipolar world.
[This confrontation has brought to a standstill the multilateral galaxy
that offered guidelines and avoided global wars in the last 75
years.]{.underline}

All human institutions have a birth, a more-or-less long life, and an
inevitable death. It has been so with every great organization, ranging
from the Roman Empire, which encompassed nearly all the known world at
the time, to the Communist International. Only Christian Churches, Roman
Catholic and Orthodox, have survived for the last 2,000 years and the
faithful believe the Churches will last until the end of time. [In a
certain sense, it is normal to see institutions suffer, become
inefficient, lose their purpose, decline and, eventually be replaced by
something different]{.underline}. The last 100 years or so have shown
that the international order can change and be effectively and
rationally modified only after a major war---something we all clearly
want to avoid for our own future and that of our children. [Right now,
we have no other way to preserve peace, order, and prosperity in the
world but with the [present institutions]{.mark}, even though the
**[profound difficulties]{.mark}** [they are going through]{.mark} are
**[clear]{.mark}** for all **to see**.]{.underline}

While global multilateralism is in crisis and a growing sense of danger
is spreading in the world, [a so-called "[minilateralism]{.mark}" is
[thriving]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Minilateralism]{.underline} is a
phenomenon which [[allows states]{.mark} that were until now
[excluded]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the most important
[decisionmaking]{.mark} processes [to **create**]{.mark} and exploit new
and **[alt]{.mark}ernative [spaces]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [make their
voices heard]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the [assembly of like-minded
countries]{.mark} joining together to protect common interests
[and]{.mark} act as a **[counter]{.mark}**weight to **[global
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even before the war in Ukraine, the
effects of globalization and the tendency to divide the world into
politically compatible macro-regions foreshadowed the crisis of large
international organizations and other forms of cooperation between
states.

[The year [2022]{.mark} [marked]{.mark} a [critical juncture]{.mark} in
international relations, as leaders expressed growing concerns over
rising tensions between major global powers]{.underline}. [[Many
countries]{.mark} have expressed a desire to [avoid]{.mark}]{.underline}
being constricted into [[taking sides in]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}
in Ukraine or]{.underline} forced into a binary choice between two
opposing superpowers, namely [the United States and China]{.underline},
which are [currently engaged in a global struggle for influence and
dominance]{.underline}. The Economist Intelligence Unit says countries
can be divided into three distinct groupings, based on statistics
related to voting habits in the UN General Assembly, trade, and
purchases of weapons. The report says 52 countries, representing 15
percent of the global population, condemn Russia and back sanctions, 12
support Russia and 127 countries are determined to remain neutral.
Leaders from a diverse range of countries and regions have expressed a
strong desire to avoid being caught in the middle of this great power
struggle. [Many]{.underline} of these [leaders]{.underline} have
[[stressed]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[importance of maintaining]{.mark}
an [independent]{.mark} [fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy in order [not
to become]{.mark} **overly [dependent]{.mark}** [on any one
country]{.mark} or alliance]{.underline}. In this scenario, these states
have created space for their own autonomous action inside the
international arena, paving the way for them to become essential
interlocutors in the future.

By avoiding potentially permanent and rigid alignments, these states
have been able to maintain their independence and flexibility, while
also building strong relationships with a range of other actors in the
international system. Grouped in minilateral groups, sometimes
geographically incongruous but united by common goals and encouraged by
the fragmentation of the world order, some mid-sized powers have
acquired more prominence and clout. At the same time, the rise of these
new actors has created fresh challenges and opportunities for global
governance.

[Examples of the [numerous initiatives]{.mark} that have
[emerged]{.mark}]{.underline} include [BRICS]{.underline}, the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, a rumored new Middle Eastern military
alliance, the United 24 Rapid Intervention Force proposed by Kyiv, the
I2U2 between India, Israel, UAE, and the United States, the Lithium
association of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Mexico and the Chip 4
Alliance between the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. [In
the defense sector, [QUAD and AUKUS]{.mark}]{.underline} have become
prominent actors, with the [[purpose of containing China's
expansion]{.mark} in the Pacific]{.underline}. These are all part of a
proliferation of multiple new collaborations, made up of a reduced
number of members and aimed at overcoming the paralysis of larger
international organizations. [[BRICS]{.mark} is probably the format that
[shows]{.mark} the [great]{.mark}er [potential in]{.mark} terms of
[political action]{.mark} and the capacity to attract new
members]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria, Egypt, Turkey,
Indonesia, and Argentina already have applied to be admitted or are
actively showing interest. In fact, BRICS could grow so much that it
could become a dangerous competitor of the G20.

[[Minilateralism]{.mark} appears to be a [favored tool of emerging
powers]{.mark}, [because]{.mark}, [unlike multilat]{.mark}eralism, [it
**facilitates** political and economic **coop**]{.mark}eration, [while
**most**]{.mark} of the international [multilat]{.mark}eral
[institutions]{.mark} are [currently **blocked** by **clashing
interests**]{.mark} of [member states]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a [lack
of]{.mark} extended [consensus]{.mark} that often stymies difficult but
pressing choices]{.underline}. [[Minilateralism]{.mark} [allows
**like-minded** countries]{.mark} [to work together in areas]{.mark}
that are [hindered by]{.mark} multilaterals or [larger]{.mark} groups of
[nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Many]{.underline} countries involved in
minilateral alliances [are large or medium-sized emerging
powers]{.underline}, often wanting to assert themselves within their own
regions. India, for example, has become a leading advocate for
minilateralism as a cornerstone of its quest for multi-polarity.
[**[Indian minilateralism]{.mark}** [involves]{.mark} a growing range of
[partnerships that allow]{.mark} the country to maintain its policy of
[strategic autonomy]{.mark}, not allying itself with any major power
[while carrying forward]{.mark}]{.underline} international
[[coop]{.mark}eration [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline} parallel to its
own political-strategic interests. In Latin America,
[[Argentina]{.mark}, [Bolivia, Chile,]{.mark} and [Mexico]{.mark} have
[grouped together to ensure]{.mark} that [other countries do not
exploit]{.mark} [their resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Argentina is
considering deepening the grouping's significance and clout through a
regional association for lithium inspired by the structure of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

#### Middle powers [drive]{.underline} multilateralism -- accountability measures, diplomatic channels, and [strengthened cooperation]{.underline}.

**Elliott 24** -- Senior Writer, Forum Stories at the World Economic
Forum (David; \"Middle powers: what are they and why do they matter?\";

Far from leading to more fragmentation in the world, [alignments between
[middle powers can]{.mark} help [drive]{.mark} the **[new
multilateralism]{.mark}**]{.underline} Guterres highlighted at Davos.

Djalal spoke of Indonesia's membership of organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and how [[establishing]{.mark} a
network of [different relationships **strengthens**]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations: "It doesn't make the
world more fragmented but I think it adds more content to the world
order. I think [the more middle powers are **less attached** to great
powers]{.mark}, in my view, the texture of [world affairs will become
better]{.mark}]{.underline}."

This view was echoed by Demeke Mekonnen Hassen, Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia. ["The [international order
has to be **fair and reasonable**]{.mark}. We [don\'t want]{.mark} to
see [unipolarity and]{.mark} we don\'t want to see and encourage
[rivalries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[[Instead]{.mark}, \[[we need\] **multiple actors**]{.mark} who are
able to look and address the structural problem of the
world]{.underline} -- especially the poor societies, underdeveloped
countries -- it's a very important time for that."

Karoline Edtstadler, Federal Minister for the European Union and
Constitution, Federal Chancellery of Austria, also highlighted the
importance of collective action in uncertain times: ["We have to
[develop]{.mark} a [strength together]{.mark}. We have to care for the
big things, we have to [negotiate with]{.mark} [other superpowers and
**middle powers**]{.mark}, we have to [find]{.mark} [ways to
**coop**]{.mark}**erate** more **[closely]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

The Forum\'s whitepaper, Shaping Cooperation in a Fragmenting World,
proposes establishing [a "[middle]{.mark}/major [powers"
group]{.mark}ing]{.underline} to leverage the influence of middle powers
on the global stage. This diplomatic mechanism would link Western major
and middle powers with non-Western ones, such as Brazil, India, South
Africa and the United Arab Emirates.

This group [would [have]{.mark} "the [diplomatic flexibility]{.mark} and
heft [to **raise**]{.mark} **the [costs]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the
[**great powers** for actions]{.mark} or behaviour [that]{.mark}
seriously [undermined]{.mark} the [multilat]{.mark}eral [order]{.mark}
and the [quiet **diplomatic channels**]{.mark} to [help]{.mark} find
[de-escalat]{.mark}ory off-ramps and similar mechanisms".]{.underline}

### India Middle Power Bad \-\-- Pakistan

#### Increasing India's global presence undermines China and Pakistan\-\--that escalates

**Kumar '23** \[Sandeep Kumar; May 22, 2023; Kumar is a candidate in
Georgetown University's Master of Arts in Conflict Resolution program,
he graduated from Georgetown in December 2023; "India's geopolitical
rise in context: Regional implications"; Atlantic Council;
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/southasiasource/indias-geopolitical-rise-in-context-regional-implications/;
accessed 07-20-2025\] NT-LY

[Increased global cooperation with India, and thus its rise in
geopolitical value, comes at]{.underline} potential [costs for its
neighbor Pakistan]{.underline}. The most immediate threat is leverage in
the Kashmir dispute. [Washington's pivot away from Pakistan and towards
India is visible in its different levels of engagement with the two
South Asian nations]{.underline}. For instance, last year's Independence
Day wishes for both countries came from different departments in the US
government. For India, the message came directly from US President
Joseph R. Biden, reiterating their joint visions in promoting global
peace and security. However, for Pakistan, the communication came from
US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and only emphasized generic,
non-defense areas of collaboration such as student exchanges. 

Some may argue that India's rising value vis-à-vis Pakistan is not
zero-sum, given that the United States recently defended its military
maintenance package to Islamabad. However, this material expression of
support appears to be the exception instead of the rule. Messages such
as those from former Presidents Barack H. Obama, Donald J. Trump, and
today Joe Biden have historically been subtle indicators of Washington's
aspirations in the region. For instance, Obama called his 2010
Independence Day communications with Pakistan "the expressions of true
friendship that come in a time of need." Given the visible contrast
today from previous years, Washington is sending strong signals of
India's greater role in the region over Pakistan's. 

[Diminishing support in Washington in light of India's rising status
means that **Pakistani leverage** in the Kashmir border dispute **is at
risk** now more than ever]{.underline}. Despite recognizing both sides
in the Kashmir conflict, the United States has increasingly shown
unbalanced support to India. For instance, the US strategy post-2018
border incidents in Kashmir involved hardening its stance on Pakistan's
failure to curb terrorism, such as pushing to place the country on a
global terrorism financing watch list and suspending military aid.
Indeed, the concerns that prompted these actions are well founded. 

However, [reports of India's human rights violations in Kashmir from the
same time prompted no substantive response from Washington]{.underline}.
A year later, when Delhi revoked autonomy for its portion of the
disputed Kashmir territory, initiated internet blackouts, put senior
political figures on house arrest, and deepened its historic repression
of civil society and free expression there, not only did the United
States sidestep the issue but it also welcomed Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi for a community summit in Houston a month later.
Washington's favoritism at the time was evident when Modi
was regarded at the summit as "doing a truly exceptional job for India
and all of the Indian people" by then-President Trump. Moving to the
current day, India's hosting of the G20 in its portion of Kashmir have
gone uncriticized by the United States despite Delhi's continued human
rights abuses there. Biden even announced plans to host Modi for a state
visit in June, in blatant ignorance of reports by the State Department
noting increased acts of state repression in India.

[Passivity on India's human rights abuses and destabilizing actions due
to its strategic value is hypocritical]{.underline} with regards to the
United States' purported foreign policy values. [It could elicit
responses from Islamabad and non-state entities in the region that do
not promote stability in South Asia nor are conducive to US interests
there]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} not only [raises the stakes in
the Kashmir conflict]{.underline} but also [adds a new layer to the
region's already tense security architecture]{.underline}.

*Increased risk of Chinese retaliation*

[India's geopolitical rise]{.underline} has also [increased the chance
of an **escalation with China** by directly putting its interests at
risk]{.underline}. For instance, Japan's expanded partnership and
alignment with India has focused on building resilience against Chinese
presence in the East and South China Sea. This was evident in
Tokyo's new Indo-Pacific plan in late March where Delhi was encouraged
to contribute infrastructure in "maritime warning and surveillance
capabilities." [India's deepening relationship with regional allies such
as Australia has also been maneuvered towards maritime security
initiatives]{.underline} with an increased focus on countering
militarization in the disputed zones and protecting resource
exploitation in the Pacific. Given[ Beijing's heavy involvement in these
disputed territories, such attempts seem to be **singling out China's
interests, and are bound to push Beijing to retaliate.** ]{.underline}

In response to some of these developments, Chinese leadership has
already warned of "conflict and confrontation." The launch of these
ventures, which Beijing regards as anti-China, have positioned India as
an even stronger adversary with significant potential repercussions.

[India's increased influence is also repositioning its leverage on
border disputes with China]{.underline}. For instance, recent
independent investigations revealed that the United States shared
crucial satellite imagery of Chinese military positions during a
December 2022 border clash, helping to give India an edge. Such
intelligence sharing was a direct result of US-India joint
initiatives that were reaffirmed earlier in the year. A month before
these events, joint US-India drills were also carried out in historic
proximity to Chinese military bases in the disputed territory. However,
as regional experts warn, "US support for India, while welcomed, must
tread carefully so as to not conflate the recently intensified US-China
rivalry with the long-standing India-China border dispute." 

With Washington projected to continue providing such strategic support,
helping India with its security issues will likely raise tensions with
Beijing, as Washington's entry comes at a time when both countries are
already struggling to find agreement on the issue of the border dispute.
This consequence must be incorporated into US and Western policymakers'
calculi.

**How is the region responding?**

In light of these developments, [China and Pakistan will adjust their
strategic calculi accordingly, bringing along risks of heightened
**tensions and escalation**]{.underline}. [China's assertiveness on
Taiwan is an expected consequence]{.underline}. While traditionally this
has come as a reaction to the United States, [recent Indian strategic
gains bring an added element of risk for Beijing]{.underline}. Whether
rightly perceived or not, these heightened fears in China will impact
its assertiveness in what it regards as its territories, and the region
and West will have to contend with those developments. 

[Beijing's current aggressiveness in the region in response is an active
sign of these adjustments]{.underline}. From exhibiting "ready to
fight" exercises around Taiwan to launching counter-militias against the
first-ever ASEAN-India joint exercises in the South China Sea, China is
asserting its strength in the region. It has also directly responded to
the border dispute risks, given India-US collaboration, by seeking
support elsewhere. In renewed talks with Bhutan earlier this year,
Beijing pushed an exclusive border deal that could build leverage
against India if it loses strategic ground in the disputed Doklam
plateau. Beijing's attempted renaming of several areas which India
disputes have also accompanied a similar policy of counter response. As
such, [increasing pressure on China by the West via India has pushed
China in unexpected ways, leading to strong responses from Beijing that
Washington may not be expecting.]{.underline}

Likewise, [Pakistan is expected to reassert itself in Kashmir in fear of
its diminishing international value]{.underline}. Early signs are
evident in its increasingly strong stance on the issue at the United
Nations. The recent resurfacing of disagreements on Kashmir at the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit between India and Pakistan's
representatives reaffirms that [the Pakistani side feels its concerns
are not being adequately considered by the international
community]{.underline}. A continued trajectory in this direction will
only further **[destabilize relations with its neighbor
India]{.underline}**. Islamabad has already identified both issues that
India receives implicit US support for---human rights violations and
Kashmir's change in status---as major roadblocks to a future
resolution. 

Given the nuclear capabilities of both nations, [the international
community should remain on high alert, especially considering
Pakistan's expanding military and economic cooperation with
China]{.underline}. New analysis suggests that the increased partnership
comes at a time when Islamabad is gripped by internal disagreements over
a potential pivot to China (over the United States). If these
speculations are true, Pakistan and China may "lock" both India and the
United States out of counterterrorism efforts in the region, which poses
not only risks to their national security but also to regional
stability; terrorist attacks have brought India and Pakistan to the
brink of war on numerous occasions. 

The [recent trilateral talks between China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan
are an early sign of a potential strategic realignment in that
direction.]{.underline} [The United States and India may soon find
counterterrorism and related regional issues, already resurfacing, to be
harder to combat]{.underline} once Washington's pivot to Delhi takes
hold and drives Pakistan fully into China's camp.

#### Escalation triggers water wars

NT-LY

[KARACHI: The head of Pakistan's diplomatic mission]{.underline} touring
world capitals to [explain Islamabad's position on]{.underline} a recent
military standoff with [New Delhi warned Friday **India's threat to cut
off** his country's **water supply** could lead to the **"first water
war" between two nuclear-armed states** at a think tank in
Brussels.]{.underline}

[The warning came after New Delhi announced in April it was suspending
the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty]{.underline}, a World Bank-brokered
agreement seen as a cornerstone of India-Pakistan water cooperation,
following a deadly gun attack in Kashmir, which it blamed on Pakistan.

Islamabad denied any involvement and called for an impartial
international probe. However, [tensions quickly escalated, with both
sides deploying fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery fire before
a US-brokered ceasefire was announced]{.underline} by President Donald
Trump on May 10.

Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, [Pakistan's]{.underline} former foreign minister
and the [current head of]{.underline} the country's [diplomatic
outreach, told the European think tank India's threat to disrupt river
flows affecting 240 million people amounted to a "war
crime]{.underline}."

"[It would turn this into an existential crisis, and we would be left
with no choice but to embark on the first water war... between two
nuclear-armed states]{.underline}," he said.

Bhutto-Zardari described the Indus Waters Treaty as "the gold standard
in diplomacy," noting it had survived multiple wars and had been
replicated in over 40 other international water-sharing agreements.

He said recent Indian actions, such as the delayed or excessive release
of water, had already damaged Pakistan's crops and posed a humanitarian
risk.

"[Just a few days' delay in water release can have devastating
consequences for our agriculture]{.underline}," he said. "[This is the
only water supply into Pakistan. In the context of climate
vulnerability, the last thing we need is a fault line developing where
cooperation once existed."]{.underline}

His other delegation members maintained undermining the treaty would set
a dangerous global precedent, allowing upper riparian states anywhere in
the world to disregard binding water-sharing agreements.

"If this treaty is in abeyance, then no treaty signed after World War II
is worth the paper it's written on," Musadik Malik, the climate change
minister, said. "That threatens the rights of lower riparian countries
across Africa, South America and beyond."

Earlier, in a brief exchange with reporters, Bhutto-Zardari welcomed
renewed interest from Washington in mediating between India and
Pakistan.

"As you have seen, President \[Donald\] Trump said once again yesterday
that he is ready to mediate on Kashmir," he noted. "At the moment,
Pakistan is talking about peace, America is also talking about peace. If
anyone is still talking about war, it is India, and, by the grace of
God, they will step back from this position soon."

Responding to a query, Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned Israel's
military operations against Iran and its broader regional policies.

"[We strongly oppose the attack on Iran and the way the war is being
waged in this region]{.underline}," he said. "No amount of condemnation
is enough. We demand that this war be stopped and that the entire world
plays its role. Peace is very important in our territory. We cannot
afford Israel's war on Iran to continue for long."

accessed 07-21-2025\] NT-LY

**Calm before renewed storms**

The situation remains precarious. Ceasefire violations have been
reported. Punitive non-military actions taken by both countries,
following the 22 April terror attack in Pahalgam in which 26 civilians
were killed, remain in place. These include [the suspension of visa
services, closure of air space, a ban on bilateral trade, and closure of
the Attari-Wagah border crossing]{.underline}. Most significantly, [the
Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) remains in abeyance after New Delhi suspended
the agreement.]{.underline}

[The ceasefire also does not address any of the underlying grievances in
the bilateral relationship]{.underline}. In a social media post, US
Secretary of State Marco Rubio noted that both sides have agreed to
'start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site'. Talks between
both countries' military personnel took place on 12 May, but it remains
to be seen if this paves the way for meaningful political dialogue.

[India has stated that talks can only discuss the issues of terrorism
and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while Pakistan will want to focus on
the resumption of the IWT and the status of Indian-administered
Kashmir]{.underline}. The last time both countries engaged in
substantive peace talks was the Composite Dialogue process that came to
a halt following the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008.

In the absence of political dialogue, it is not a question of if but
when hostilities resume. [New Delhi has stated that **it will consider
another attack** like Pahalgam **an act of war**, while Islamabad has
said the same with respect to any violation of the IWT. ]{.underline}

At the same time, the most recent tensions indicate that [both countries
are moving up the escalation ladder]{.underline}. The rules of
engagement have shifted as each has adopted a more assertive military
posture. 

This includes targeting civilian and military infrastructure beyond
Indian and Pakistan-administered Kashmir into both countries'
heartlands. It also reflects the military platforms that were utilized
during the most recent hostilities, including the heavy use of drones
and the first deployment of the Indian Navy in combat operations since
the 1971 war between both countries.

Both governments have denied reports that Pakistan's Nuclear Command
Authority convened during the hostilities and that the Indian Air
Force struck a Pakistani nuclear storage facility. 

But such reports illustrate genuine fears of nuclear escalation. In
his first speech since the ceasefire came into effect, [Modi stated that
India will no longer tolerate 'nuclear blackmail']{.underline}. [This
alludes to New Delhi's claim that **Islamabad relies on non-state
(terrorist) actors to attack India**, in the belief that Pakistan's
nuclear arsenal will deter India from retaliating.]{.underline}

But [India and the United States are not aligned on all
issues]{.underline}. [New Delhi]{.underline} does not want a world in
which Washington is perpetually the sole superpower. Instead, it [seeks
a **multipolar international system**, in which India would rank as a
genuine great power]{.underline}. [It aims to restrain]{.underline} not
just [China]{.underline}---the near-term challenge---[but also any
country that would aspire to singular, hegemonic dominance, including
the United States.]{.underline}

[India]{.underline} believes that multipolarity is the key to both
global peace and its own rise. It [obsessively guards its strategic
autonomy, eschewing formal alliances and maintaining ties with Western
adversaries such as Iran and Russia]{.underline}, even as it has grown
closer to the United States. This behavior is intended to help advance a
multipolar international order. But [it may not be effective or even
realistic]{.underline}. Although India has grown in economic strength
over the last two decades, [it is **not growing fast enough to balance**
China, let alone the United States]{.underline}, even in the long term.

Chinese-supplied defense systems to shoot down Indian aircraft. [With

On April 14, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida concluded a nearly
week-long visit to the US. During the visit, the [two [sides set]{.mark}
the [tone for]{.mark} the adjustment of [Japan-US
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. To loosen the restraints on Japan\'s
military expansion and combat preparedness, the [US further
[intensified]{.mark} its alliance [system]{.mark} with itself at the
core by strengthening its ties with Japan]{.underline}. [Analysts
commented that the relevant moves would drive the Japan-US alliance to
[veer toward a **more dangerous direction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

They reaffirmed the commitments on the Japan-US Security Treaty for
enhanced joint deterrence. The joint statement issued by the two sides
emphasized the role of the above treaty as a cornerstone in bilateral
relations, [unabashedly [exhibiting]{.mark} the [deterrence]{.mark} of
their alliance [against]{.mark} [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. The two
parties declared to [improve alliance mechanisms]{.underline} for
seamless coordination, including establishing a [new \"[joint
command]{.mark}\"]{.underline} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF),
upgrading the [[US Forces]{.mark} Japan command]{.underline},
strengthening [[intelligence sharing]{.mark} and [base
construction]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [amplifying the [deployment of
reconnaissance, firepower, logistics and]{.mark} other [forces]{.mark}
in the southwest region.]{.underline} Their [enhanced cooperation in
command, intelligence, military industry and more fields has
[pose]{.mark}d **[serious threats to regional security and
stability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [US instigated Japan to enhance its military expansion and
war]{.underline} preparedness so as to assume more obligations of the
alliance. Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once compared the
Japan-US security framework to a \"bottle stopper\" that could prevent
the reemergence of Japanese militarism. However, [to deal with the
**[imaginary threats]{.mark}**, the [US]{.mark} has constantly made
compromises with Japan, and even [shown tolerance]{.mark} [towards
Japan's liberation from]{.mark} the shackles of the \"exc[lusively
defense-oriented\" principle and acquisition of]{.mark} mid-range and
long-range [strike capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the end of
2022, Japan released a new version of the three national security
documents proposing to increase its defense budget to 2% of GDP for the
development of stand-off defense capabilities. During Kishida\'s visit
to the US, the two sides declared to \"elevate their defense ties to
unprecedented levels.\" Moreover, a joint statement issued by the two
countries said that the US would provide technological support for Japan
to effectively develop and employ the counterattack capabilities of the
latter. In the face of Japan\'s perilous transition from defense to
offense, the US seems to have forgotten the painful lessons of the
Attack on Pearl Harbor. Analysts believe that the US\'s enticing Japan
to revive the illusion of becoming a military power essentially aims at
further binding the latter to its own chariot. Nonetheless, such a move
is tantamount to a poisoned chalice carrying the potential for
detrimental consequences that harm both the US itself and others.

They aimed to form a [dense alliance and [partnership]{.mark}
network]{.underline}, which might **[[aggravate the regional bloc
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During Kishida\'s visit to the US,
the two sides proclaimed to build a US-Japan-Australia networked air
defense architecture, boost US-Japan-ROK annual military exercises on
the basis of the 2023 Camp David Summit, and regularly hold US-Japan-UK
trilateral exercises from 2025. Japan and the US have expanded their
alliance by developing mini-lateral relationship with the Philippines,
Australia, the ROK and other countries, in a bid to strengthen the
US-led regional security cooperation mechanism. [With the further
expansion of the US alliance and partnership in the
Indo-Pacific,]{.underline} the military cooperation among the relevant
countries, especially at the equipment interoperability level, is likely
to be significantly elevated in a short time, and the **[[regional bloc
confrontation will also be exacerbated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

It is not difficult to see that the Japan-US summit chanted the mantra
of \"freedom and openness\" while brandishing the flag of \"order and
rules,\" but their actual behaviors revolved around causing disturbances
and inciting conflicts. The two countries vaunted that their alliance
has been \"elevated to unprecedented levels\", but [virtually its
adverse impact on regional [security and stability has]{.mark} also
[reached an unparalleled extent,]{.mark} which [deserves]{.mark} high
[vigilance from]{.mark} the international

would expect Europe to completely abandon the F-35 fighter. [That [loss
alone]{.mark} will be [tantamount to a loss of hundreds]{.mark} [of

top-line equipment to the likes of Russia or China. For one, the
Europeans would not allow it (they would sanction and attack the United
States), and for another, the Russians and Chinese can't afford it even
if we were reckless enough to lose our minds and attempt to sell such
weapons to them. [The relationship we have with [Europe ensures]{.mark}
that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates A&D [industry makes hundreds of
billions]{.mark} in revenues and that "the West" remains well armed with
US weapons.]{.underline} Again, this is a choice made by MAGA and the
President, it's nothing being driven by outside forces; it's a choice
made by delusion and defamation.

**[A [challenge to the]{.mark} U.S. [dollar's

world's reserve currency]{.mark},]{.underline} in large part
[[because]{.mark} American [military power underpins]{.mark} global

[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} becomes a self-sufficient power center, it

[currencies, reducing global dependence on the

"Greenback" around the world; especially if the ECB and its leaders in
France and Germany are stable, and the US is led by an Orange Orangutan
who imposes tariffs without warning and flip-flops daily with no

//adiiiiG

The shifting landscape of international politics, significantly
influenced by the policies of President Donald Trump, is compelling the
European Union to forge a more assertive international policy. This
represents a departure from the comfortable protection afforded by US
foreign policy since the conclusion of the Second World War. An initial
stride in this direction was the "ReArmEU" programme, now known as
"Readiness 2030", which extends financial aid to member states to
augment their armaments expenditure. While the establishment of a
comprehensive European defence force was a logical progression, the
European Commission, adopting a cautious approach reminiscent of the
monetary union's genesis, stopped short of formally proposing it. Just
as the European Monetary System (EMS) -- a coordination of national
currencies -- preceded the approval of the Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) in Maastricht, the current strategy appears to favour incremental
steps.

Now, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB),
has advocated for "a greater international role" for the euro,
specifically its active function as an international reserve currency.
This proposal, made at a recent conference in Berlin, is seen as crucial
for fostering greater autonomy in European foreign policy.

President Lagarde presented several compelling arguments to justify this
new orientation for European monetary policy. The euro currently stands
as the world's second-largest international reserve currency, holding a
20 percent share of global reserves, in contrast to the US dollar's 58
percent. Other major currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi, the
Japanese yen, and the British pound, possess significantly smaller
shares. A further argument in the euro's favour is the European Union's
extensive trade relationships, encompassing 72 countries and accounting
for 40 percent of global trade -- more than double its currency
reserves.

Lagarde also contextualised her proposal by outlining the historical
evolution of the international monetary order. She recounted the
nineteenth century's Gold Standard era, which was centred on the pound
sterling and lacked institutional coordination. This monetary order
collapsed with the onset of the First World War, as belligerent nations
adopted protectionist policies. The post-war period saw its rebuilding,
with the US emerging as the dominant economy. Following the severe
economic crisis of 1929, President Roosevelt declared the dollar
inconvertible into gold in 1933. The Bretton Woods Agreement in 1944
subsequently established a fixed parity between the dollar and gold,
setting it at \$35 per ounce (a stark contrast to today's value of over
\$3,500). In 1971, President Nixon again declared the dollar
inconvertible into gold, ushering in the era of floating exchange rates.

The nation that secures the monopoly of the international currency gains
substantial advantages, famously dubbed "exorbitant privilege" by Valéry
Giscard d'Estaing, then France's Minister of Finance under General de
Gaulle. While countries with non-dominant currencies are compelled to
restrict imports when foreign currency reserves dwindle, the same
constraint does not apply to the nation holding the reserve currency.
Moreover, in times of international financial crisis, capital tends to
flow into the strongest and most stable economy, perceived as a safe
haven. This phenomenon can lead to an inflationary process within the
international monetary and financial system, a process that some
economists, such as Jacques de Larosière, have denounced as dangerous
and without clear limits.

Lagarde highlighted that the country with a reserve currency benefits
from a virtuous circle that fosters greater economic growth. She noted
that "with each one percentage point increase in market capitalisation
yielding 0.5 percentage points more growth". Furthermore, she recalled
that "since 1970, there have been 34 instances of simultaneous sovereign
debt and financial crisis globally, but the US has remained immune to
such 'twin crisis\'". However, Lagarde contended that this situation has
begun to change. During the crisis triggered by the threat of high
tariff barriers from the US President, "the US dollar and US Treasuries
experiencing sell-offs even as equities fell. The same doubts are also
cited by investors who are turning to gold: two-fifths say they are
doing so as a hedge against rising geopolitical risks." Conversely,
during this particular crisis, the euro appreciated against the dollar.

The Euro and the International Monetary Order -- President Lagarde's
proposal to enhance the euro's international role is seen as a positive
step, given its potential to become a leading international reserve
currency. However, critics note that Lagarde remains somewhat vague
about the future international monetary order that might emerge from
this European policy. In this context, she referenced an observation by
economist Robert Triffin, a prominent theorist of the international
monetary order and the architect of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
Triffin is quoted as having argued "that nations' confidence in the
international monetary system depends on the reliability of the reserve
currency, which, in his words, is 'highly dependent on individual
countries' decisions\'".

This particular quote has been described as cryptic and not fully
reflective of Triffin's core theoretical contributions throughout his
career. Since the establishment of the European Payments Union
(1947-1956), Triffin's proposals consistently drew upon the Keynes Plan,
presented at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. In this plan, Keynes
advocated for an international reserve currency called "Bancor", a
composite of the dollar and the pound. The United States, however, opted
for the White Plan, which designated the dollar as the sole
international reserve currency. Nevertheless, Keynes' plan served as
Triffin's inspiration in the 1960s, when the dollar's fixed exchange
rate with gold became unsustainable. Triffin then proposed a bold reform
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF): the creation of Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs). Today, SDRs are a basket of five currencies
(dollar, euro, Renminbi, yen, pound), designed to function as Keynes'
Bancor -- a reserve currency for national central banks. This reform was
adopted as the Fund's first amendment but was never fully implemented
due to the US government's veto. Yet, Triffin's influence was again
evident during the formation of the European Monetary Union, where the
European Currency Unit (ECU), a basket of European currencies, served as
a precursor to the EMU, as established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.
For Triffin, ECUs and SDRs were conceptually aligned.

Reflecting on its centuries-long evolution, the history of the
international monetary order can be summarised in three phases. Phase
one saw the pound establish itself as the reserve instrument during the
First Industrial Revolution. Phase two witnessed the dollar's ascendancy
as the reserve currency during the Second Industrial Revolution. Phase
three, in the current era of globalisation, raises the question of which
national currency will prevail. Triffin consistently cautioned against
the pitfalls of basing an international monetary order on a single
national currency. This warning resonates today: if the euro were to
solidify its position as an international reserve currency, it would not
only ignite potentially dangerous competition between the euro and the
dollar but also effectively exclude major economies like China, which is
actively promoting the Renminbi as an international reserve currency,
India, and Brazil are all members of the BRICS group. These nations are
already developing independent instruments for international payments,
bypassing both the dollar and the euro. Ultimately, the proliferation of
competing international reserve currencies could lead to a scenario akin
to the 1930s, characterised by destabilising capital movements that
exacerbated dangerous tensions between nation states.

A European Federal Government for a European Foreign Policy -- The ECB
President's proposal is best viewed as an appropriate response to the
potentially disruptive policies emanating from the US. Furthermore, it
underscores the increasing urgency and scope of the reforms outlined in
the Letta and Draghi reports. More broadly, it is evident that post-war
international institutions are in need of reform. For instance, the
enduring right of veto held by five countries within the UN Security
Council routinely obstructs attempts at meaningful reform, despite
ongoing humanitarian crises such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and widespread violence across Africa.

The European Union cannot merely lament humanity's tragedies; it must
propose constructive reforms. The European Commission often appears
constrained by the resurgent sovereignist sentiments prevalent in many
European governments, which manifest within the Council of Ministers and
threaten the Union's cohesion. A European currency and a robust European
defence -- "the purse and the sword" -- represent the fundamental powers
of all modern states. The time has come for influential voices within
Europe to rekindle the vision of the Schuman Declaration: the European
Coal and Steel Community as the foundational step towards a European
federation and global peace. The imperative now is to establish a
supranational political movement, or a coalition of political parties,
dedicated to the creation of the United States of Europe.

#### Here\'s [more]{.underline} evidence. Macron is trying to [collapse]{.underline} the dollar. 

**Haber 25** \[Romy el Haber, researcher and journalist with a master's
degree in international security, focusing on non-state actors,
minorities in the Middle East, and individual sovereignty., 7-21-2025,

//adiiiiG

If an EU country like France has an issue with the White House's policy
or approach towards a contentious issue, it should bring it up with the
US directly. It is imperative that allies do not engage in public
criticisms or conflicts with one another, especially in front of their
adversaries, such as China. This approach ensures that diplomatic
channels remain open and constructive, reinforcing the importance of
maintaining a united front against shared threats.

However, French President Emmanuel Macron, in a diplomatic misstep,
traveled to Beijing to assert France\'s foreign policy independence from
the United States. After exchanging pleasantries at a tea ceremony in
Guangzhou during a three-day state visit to China, he emphasized the
need for Europe to "reduce its dependency on the United States" and
challenge "the extraterritoriality of the U.S. dollar."

Macron insisted on positioning France as a "third superpower," claiming
it would lead Europe's "strategic autonomy." However, Macron should
realize that strategic autonomy does not come from placating China. The
war in Ukraine demonstrates that the Franco-German Axis is not the
leader it claims to be. The United States, Poland, the United Kingdom,
and the Baltic countries are the ones doing the most. For its own
security, Europe cannot afford to be Franco-German \"led.\"

Macron\'s belief that Europe can detach from its primary security
partner, the United States, amid the collapse of the liberal order and
the rise of autocracies, is a dangerous and ill-timed delusion.

The United States has long been a crucial ally for Europe, providing
essential security guarantees and support. Macron's arrogance and ego
may remind us of Charles de Gaulle in 1966, when he demanded that
American military personnel leave France. At the time, President Johnson
famously asked if that order applied to American soldiers buried in
French cemeteries.

Macron's remarks risk pushing for more American isolationism, which is
not in Europe's interest. The French president also stated that he
doesn't want Europe to be entangled "in crises that are not ours," like
Taiwan. Yet, he is relying on U.S. security commitments in the crisis
over Ukraine.

The United States has committed over \$113 billion to the war in Europe.
The least it can expect in return is that European leaders refrain from
turning to China and expressing disinterest in supporting America. This
is the bare minimum that allies should expect from each other.

Furthermore, Macron's position risks dividing Europe. Nordic, Central,
and Eastern European countries view the United States as their security
guarantor and will not abandon that relationship for France's sake.

The lack of any deterrent message to Beijing is dangerous. Macron is
indirectly saying autocratic powers can bully their neighbours without
facing repercussions and that Europe will stay neutral on the issue. The
Taiwan crisis is not about America but about Taiwan's sovereignty and
Chinese imperial ambitions. Macron's remarks are incongruous with the
fundamental principles of European classical liberalism and hasten the
demise of the liberal international order.

Perhaps President Macron could benefit from revisiting the timeless
fable of La Fontaine, \"The Frog Who Wished to Be as Big as the Ox.\" In
this tale, a frog endeavours to expand itself to the size of an ox, only
to meet a tragic end by bursting in the process.

Similarly, while France may aspire to be a "third superpower,\" it must
bear in mind the vital role played by its transatlantic partners,
notably the United States. Just as the frog\'s overinflation posed a
threat to its own existence, France\'s pursuit of excessive arrogance
may jeopardise its relations with the United States and other nations.

#### The GENIUS act is [increasing]{.underline} dollar hegemony [right now]{.underline}

**White House 25** \[White House, 7-18-2025, \"Fact Sheet: President
Donald J. Trump Signs GENIUS Act into Law\",
https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/\]
//adiiiiG

MAKING AMERICA THE LEADER IN DIGITAL ASSETS: Today, President Donald J.
Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a historic piece of legislation
that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital
currency revolution.

The GENIUS Act prioritizes consumer protection, strengthens the U.S.
dollar's reserve currency status, and bolsters our national security.

The GENIUS Act will make America the undisputed leader in digital
assets, bringing massive investment and innovation to our country.

PROTECTING CONSUMERS IN THE DIGITAL MARKET: President Trump supports the
GENIUS Act because it protects consumers from nefarious actors in
financial markets.

This long-overdue legislation creates the first-ever Federal regulatory
system for stablecoins, ensuring their stability and trust through
strong reserve requirements.

The GENIUS Act requires 100% reserve backing with liquid assets like
U.S. dollars or short-term Treasuries and requires issuers to make
monthly, public disclosures of the composition of reserves.

Stablecoin issuers must comply with strict marketing rules to protect
consumers from deceptive practices. Crucially, they are forbidden from
making misleading claims that their stablecoins are backed by the U.S.
government, federally insured, or legal tender.

The GENIUS Act aligns State and Federal stablecoin frameworks, ensuring
fair and consistent regulation throughout the country.

In the event of insolvency of a stablecoin issuer, the GENIUS Act
prioritizes stablecoin holders' claims over all other creditors,
ensuring a final backstop of consumer protection.

ENSURING U.S. DOLLAR GLOBAL RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS: By driving demand
for U.S. Treasuries, stablecoins will play a crucial role in ensuring
the continued global dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve
currency.

The GENIUS Act will generate increased demand for U.S. debt and cement
the dollar's status as the global reserve currency by requiring
stablecoin issuers to back their assets with Treasuries and U.S.
dollars.

Additionally, the GENIUS Act will play a key role in attracting more
digital asset activity to the country by providing clear rules and
promoting responsible innovation in the stablecoin market.

COMBATING ILLICIT ACTIVITY IN DIGITAL ASSETS: Through regulation and
registration of stablecoin issuers, along with coordination with the
Treasury Department on sanctions enforcement, the GENIUS Act reinforces
our national security.

The GENIUS Act explicitly subjects stablecoin issuers to the Bank
Secrecy Act, thereby clearly obligating them to establish effective
anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs with risk
assessments, sanctions list verification, and customer identification.

This legislation improves the Treasury Department's ability to combat
illicit stablecoin activities by enhancing its sanctions evasion and
money laundering enforcement capabilities.

All stablecoin issuers must possess the technical capability to seize,
freeze, or burn payment stablecoins when legally required and must
comply with lawful orders to do so.

DELIVERING ON PROMISE TO MAKE AMERICA THE CRYPTO CAPITAL OF THE
WORLD: President Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to position
America as the global leader in cryptocurrency.

President Trump promised to make the United States the "crypto capital
of the world," emphasizing the need to embrace digital assets to drive
economic growth and technological leadership.

In his first week in office, President Trump signed an Executive Order
to promote United States leadership in digital assets.

In March, President Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,
positioning the United States as a leader among nations in government
digital asset strategy.

President Trump has long been a proponent of the GENIUS Act, saying it
"is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets ---
Nobody will do it better, it is pure GENIUS! Digital Assets are the
future, and our Nation is going to own it. We are talking about MASSIVE
Investment, and Big Innovation. The House will hopefully move LIGHTNING
FAST, and pass a 'clean' GENIUS Act. Get it to my desk, ASAP --- NO
DELAYS, NO ADD ONS. This is American Brilliance at its best, and we are
going to show the World how to WIN with Digital Assets like never
before!"

#### Here's [more]{.underline} evidence

**Smith 25** \[Kristin Smith, President of Solana Policy Institute,
6-13-2025, \"America's Dollar Dominance Depends on GENIUS\", CoinDesk,
https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/13/americas-dollar-dominance-depends-on-genius\]
//adiiiiG

We are closer than ever to cementing America's global leadership in
digital asset innovation. Next week, the Senate will hold its final vote
on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins
Act -- the GENIUS Act -- bringing this landmark stablecoin legislation
one step closer to becoming law. Following Senate passage, the bill will
advance to the House for consideration. This marks a significant step
forward -- not just for the crypto industry, but for American consumers,
investors, and the global strength of the U.S. dollar.

The numbers tell the story. Today, more than \$190 billion in
dollar-backed stablecoins are in circulation worldwide, doubling
annually. Stablecoins aren\'t speculative crypto assets -- they are
digital dollars that enable instant, low-cost transactions anywhere in
the world. In regions facing currency devaluation or authoritarian
financial controls, stablecoins provide access to the economic stability
of the U.S. dollar. Not only is this pro-innovation -- it\'s
pro-democracy.

The GENIUS Act provides the clarity the industry urgently needs. By
establishing sensible guidelines, it ensures stablecoins maintain stable
value through high-quality liquid reserves, regular audits, and clear
redemption rights. These aren\'t excessive burdens -- they're reasonable
protections already practiced by responsible issuers.

Most importantly, what the GENIUS Act provides is certainty, allowing
responsible innovation to flourish while preventing bad actors from
undermining the system.

Passing GENIUS can't wait. As other nations develop central bank digital
currencies and alternative payment systems designed to circumvent dollar
dominance, the United States faces a choice: embrace the innovation
that\'s already spreading dollars globally, or cede this ground to other
countries. The legislation provides the framework we need -- strong
reserve requirements, transparency rules, and consumer protections --
without stifling the innovation that makes stablecoins so powerful.

Progress on stablecoin legislation has been bipartisan, reflecting a
growing recognition across the political spectrum that this technology
serves American interests. Republicans see free-market innovation and
reduced government intervention. Democrats value the financial inclusion
and consumer protection aspects. Both parties understand that
maintaining dollar supremacy isn\'t partisan -- it\'s patriotic.

Globally, stablecoins are already making a profound difference.
In Argentina, where inflation has exceeded 100%, residents use dollar
stablecoins to preserve their savings. In Ukraine, humanitarian
organizations have used them to deliver aid instantly when traditional
banking channels failed. Across Africa and Southeast Asia, entrepreneurs
have access to dollar liquidity and can build businesses that connect to
the global economy. Each transaction strengthens the dollar\'s role as
the world\'s reserve currency.

The technology community knows what\'s on the line. That\'s why
companies of all sizes -- from traditional financial
institutions to Silicon Valley startups -- want clarity around
stablecoins. They\'re not asking for light-touch regulation or special
treatment; they\'re asking for clear rules that allow them to build in
America, serve American interests, and extend American financial
leadership globally.

Meanwhile, every month that goes by, more stablecoin activity moves
offshore, more innovation happens outside our borders, and more ground
is ceded to competitors. The European Union has already implemented
stablecoin guidelines. Singapore, the UAE, and others are rolling out
frameworks to attract this activity.

Dollar-backed stablecoins don\'t compete with the Federal Reserve; they
extend its reach. They don\'t undermine American banking; they create
new customers for it. They don\'t weaken financial oversight; they make
it more effective through programmable compliance and real-time
transparency. Stablecoins are foundational infrastructure, not ideology.

Passing the GENIUS Act requires no vast expenditures or bureaucratic
complexity. It simply offers clear rules for American innovation to
thrive, safeguards consumers, and fortifies the dollar's global
influence.

The message to Congress is clear: Don\'t let this moment pass. The world
won't pause while America deliberates. With the GENIUS Act, we can
ensure that the future of global finance remains dollar-denominated,
governed by American values, and powered by our unmatched American
ingenuity.

Hope for a reversal

To be sure, [the [dollar's]{.mark} continued [decline]{.mark} is by [no
means a sure thing]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [others on [Wall
Street]{.mark} [think the trend down could
**reverse**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Thomas Matthews, head of Asia Pacific markets at Capital Economics, said
the recent rally in stocks points to growing comfort with U.S. assets,
with the earlier dollar weakness perhaps just a product of the intended
appreciation of other currencies as well as a switch in hedging
strategies.

[[Wells Fargo]{.mark} also [thinks dollar-related fears are
overblown.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Taking a statistical approach to analyzing the U.S. dollar's role, [it
is clear to us that [the greenback]{.mark} [remains the **linchpin** of
global trade and finance]{.mark} and is [far from becoming
irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}," Wells Fargo investment strategy
analyst Jennifer Timmerman wrote. "[We believe [the U.S. dollar benefits
from]{.mark} [deep-seated advantages]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as the
rule of law, transparency, and a highly liquid financial market) [[that
make a global shift away from the dollar an extremely difficult and
slow-moving process]{.underline}]{.mark} -- especially because of
underlying weaknesses of the most visible dollar alternatives."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also weighed in, telling CNBC on Monday
that the [currency fluctuations are "not out of the
ordinary."]{.underline}

However, rising yields on Treasury debt also signifies that concerns
over the dollar and other U.S. assets linger.

"We're in that stage of being overdone to the downside in terms of the
momentum," said Hogan, the B. Riley strategist. "But fundamentally, you
could certainly whiteboard out plenty of things that you'd be concerned
about."

//adiiiiG

**[The [dollar]{.mark} is [still dominant in]{.mark} financial
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The dollar is still the dominant currency [in foreign exchange and
international funding]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, the dollar's
[[share]{.underline}]{.mark} of over the-counter FX transactions [has
[remained]{.mark} remarkably [stable]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chart 4).
While the share of cross-border bank loans and international debt has
[actually [risen by]{.mark} around 10pp to [50% over the last 10
years]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The [[US]{.mark} also [dominates equity markets]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For example, [the US [accounts for 62%]{.mark}]{.underline} of the MSCI
All Country Index and around a similar share of the MSCI World Index. As
such, it is likely that [dollar-based assets still make up a
[significant share of foreign assets]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite FX
reserves showing some divergence away from the dollar (primarily towards
other DM currencies).

Indeed, [the [factors]{.mark} that strengthen the dollar's position,
[namely capital market openness]{.mark}, [institutional quality]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} its established [use as a currency of transaction]{.mark}
are [hard]{.mark} to replicate and overturn]{.underline}. [Even with the
creation of the euro - which meets many of these criteria - the dollar
has maintained a dominant role globally.]{.underline}

FX transactions naturally lend themselves to triangulation which
reinforces a deep single vehicle currency market. Similar to the
international use of English within business and academia, it is often
easier to transact via the USD rather than attempting bilateral exchange
between country pairs. The greater ability to hedge in dollar markets,
combined with the prevalence of multinational enterprises within the
global supply chain, are further factors which may slow a move towards
greater diversity in trade invoicing.

The rise of the renminbi faces major hurdles

China's rapid economic ascent and pivotal role within global trade set
up the RMB as the pretender to the USD throne.

The PBOC's internationalization efforts have delivered a more
market-determined exchange rate (even if it remains somewhat
interventionist at times) and central bank swap lines have been set up.
As noted above, there has also been some success at encouraging trade to
be priced in RMB. But despite all this, true internationalization
remains a distant prospect.

First, the RMB is starting from a low base. It's share in official FX
reserves is only around 3%, compared to almost 60% for the USD. Survey
research by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum
(OMFIF) found that reserve managers are in no rush to expand their RMB
holdings, anticipating that China's share of global reserves would grow
to just 6% over the next 10 years.

Secondly, China is showing no sign of running current account deficits
-- which would spur greater holdings of Chinese assets -- nor fully
liberalizing its capital account. It is true that foreign investors now
have relatively free access (while the capital account remains much
tighter for domestic entities), but fear that capital controls could be
imposed suddenly are likely still a restraining factor. More
fundamentally, there is little-to-no sign that China's high saving
structure is about to change, or that trade deficits will be condoned in
the near future.

Finally, the opacity of CCP policy making and weaker institutional
safeguards, combined with (and potentially amplified by) geopolitical
tensions damage the element of trust that helps create a global reserve
currency. Indeed, China's attempt to insulate itself from sanction risk
may backfire: exposure to the dollar system may raise the odds of 'good'
behavior (China has been at the forefront of developing a central bank
digital currency (CBDC) and this could potentially offer a route to
by-pass the dollar-based system. In theory, an importer using digital
currency could transfer the required payment, negating the need for
settlement through banks which requires instructions to be sent through
a system such as SWIFT. It is however unclear how this would operate in
practice, how an e-RMB would fit within the international system, and
over what time scale this could actually be introduced.at least in the
eyes of investors), therefore freeing oneself from the prospect of
sanctions may not in fact reduce risk premia demanded.

Multi-currency future a possibility, but unlikely in the near-term

[We think it is likely the [dollar will remain as the prominent
currency]{.mark} in global trade and finance **[as it
stands]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, it is possible that greater
diversification could occur within trade invoicing, where local
currencies or dominant regional currencies are increasingly used.

Over the longer term, this rise in local currency trade could reduce the
dollar's broader role in the global financial system. [But major hurdles
remain to reduce dollar hegemony]{.underline}.

We appear to be a long way from CBDCs providing a route to by-passing
the dollar-based system and there are questions around EMs willingness
to undertake the reforms to develop institutional quality and capital
market depth which would increase their ability to absorb capital flows
through more traditional channels. Nevertheless, were progress to be
made on these fronts it could usher in something more akin to a
multi-currency system.

US actions could lead to a self-inflicted demise of the dollar. A
technical default -- triggered by a failure to renegotiate the US debt
ceiling -- or a [[significant degradation of US institutions]{.mark}
could [weaken the dollar's position]{.mark} and open the door for other
currencies to gain a more dominant position]{.underline}.

### Military Key to Dollar\-\--1AR

#### Military dominance is [key]{.underline} to the dollar. Absent American dominance, adversaries [encroach]{.underline} on our power. 

**Walden 24** \[Stephanie Walden interviewing Pierre Yared, a MUTB
Professor of International Business Economics Division and Co-Director
of the Richard Paul Richman Center for Business, Law, and Public Policy
at Columbia University, 11-26-2024, \"Dollars and Dominance: How
Military Strength Secures Financial Power,\" Columbia Business School,
https://business.columbia.edu/research-brief/dollars-dominance-military-financial-power\]
//adiiiiG

Compared to the rest of the world, [[Americans enjoy]{.mark} some
**[significant]{.mark}** economic [perks]{.mark}]{.underline}:
relatively [[low interest]{.mark} rates]{.underline}, more [[stable
prices]{.underline}]{.mark} for imported goods, [[and greater purchasing
power]{.underline}]{.mark} when shopping from many international
retailers online. These [benefits are [due]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
part, [[to]{.mark} the fact that [the US dollar]{.mark} is the world's
reserve currency]{.underline}. That means it's a [[**benchmark**
for]{.mark} pricing [global]{.mark} financial [transactions]{.mark}, the
preferred medium for international trade, and a safe haven in times of
crisis.]{.underline} This [exorbitant privilege]{.underline}, as it's
often called, [[allows]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} government [to]{.mark}
borrow more cheaply than other nations --- and [wield **outsized
influence** in the global econom]{.mark}y.]{.underline}

But what creates this financial dominance? The answer may lie not only
in economic factors but in geopolitical might. "[Economists have been
wondering about what underpins a country's ability to be a global
reserve currency for a long time]{.underline}," says Pierre Yared, the
MUTB Professor of International Business at Columbia Business School.
"[The novel point we're making is that [this financial status is **very
much** related to the ability to **dominate the globe
militarily**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

Yared recently co-authored a [[paper examining this]{.mark} intricate
[relationship]{.mark} between military strength and global financial
dominance.]{.underline} The research found that [[transitions in
military]{.mark} [dominance]{.mark} have [**historically** coincided
with shifts in financial privilege]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and that
maintaining the stability of US financial markets is not just an
economic imperative but potentially a matter of national security.

Key Takeaways:

[Military might and financial privilege [appear to be **deeply
interconnected**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with [transitions in global
hegemony]{.underline} (world geopolitical leadership)
**[historically]{.underline}** [coinciding with shifts in currency
dominance.]{.underline}

The [US dollar's status]{.underline} as the global reserve currency is
perhaps [more closely tied to America's military power]{.underline} ---
and [[perceived likelihood of prevailing in
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} --- than previous economic analysis has
accounted for.

As such, [[disruptions]{.mark} to US financial markets,]{.underline}
such as debt ceiling crises, [[could have **national security
implications** by]{.mark} potentially [eroding America's]{.mark}
borrowing [advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Geopolitical events can significantly impact currency values and
borrowing costs around the globe, with periods of heightened tension
often increasing the US government debt's relative value.

The Military-Financial Nexus

Traditional economic analyses have chalked up the US dollar's dominance
to factors like market liquidity, trade linkages, and the sheer size of
the US economy. While these elements certainly play a role, Yared and
his co-author argue that [[military power is]{.mark} a crucial, often
[overlooked]{.mark} factor in this calculation.]{.underline} ["If you
want a global store of value, you want an asset that will preserve its
value in a cataclysmic state of the world]{.underline}," explains Yared.
"[[Only a]{.mark} [government with a **very strong military** can ensure
that a country will]{.mark} most likely [prevail and]{.mark}
[preserve]{.mark} the value of [the assets]{.mark} it
issues."]{.underline}

The paper presents [several lines of evidence supporting this
connection]{.underline}. For one, there's **[[historical
precedent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The study [traces the evolution of
global reserve currencies]{.underline}, revealing a pattern where
[emerging military powers often become financial
powerhouses]{.underline} --- l[ike the transition [from British to
American hegemony]{.mark} after World War I, [which aligned with the
pound]{.mark} [sterling losing]{.mark} its primacy [to the US
dollar]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The researchers also assessed how geopolitical risk impacts currency
values and borrowing costs. Periods of heightened geopolitical tension
tend to increase the US government debt's relative value. "When that
risk goes up, US privilege increases, because financial markets start
valuing US assets relatively more," notes Yared. "Treasury bonds sell at
a higher premium during periods of geopolitical stress, because those
are the periods when people shift toward the safest assets --- and those
will be associated with the country most likely to dominate in a
geopolitical conflict."\
\
This relationship is illustrated in Figure 2 of the report, below, which
visualizes the link between geopolitical risk and the United States'
borrowing advantages over a time frame spanning 1980 to 2020. The solid
line represents the United States' borrowing advantage, measured as
three-year government borrowing costs for other developed countries in
excess of the borrowing cost for the United States. The dashed line
shows the United States' geopolitical risk index. Key events like the
Gulf War, Iraq War, and Ukraine conflict are marked, showing spikes in
both geopolitical risk and the United States' borrowing advantage, with
a 45% correlation between the two measures.

In addition, the study examined the relationship between military
conflict outcomes and debt repayment. In the aftermath of war,
victorious nations historically tend to repay debts and maintain
currency value, while defeated countries often experience significant
inflation and currency devaluation. This indicates that military success
directly translates into financial credibility and stability. In other
words, the country issuing the safest asset is also likely to prevail in
a geopolitical conflict and not devalue that asset.

A Game-Theoretic Model

To explore these dynamics further, the researchers developed a
theoretical framework modeling interactions between two countries and
international investors. The model considers factors like geopolitical
risk, military spending, and investor perceptions.

The model revealed a complex interplay of forces. The researchers
identified a two-way interaction wherein military strength often confers
financial advantages, which in turn enable greater military spending,
creating a self-reinforcing loop. However, the model also suggested a
potential for fragility in the global financial system: If two countries
have similarly deep financial markets, there may be a greater risk of
rapid shifts in dominance.

Intriguingly, the model indicated that under certain conditions, a shift
in global financial dominance could occur peacefully --- without war ---
driven instead by coordinated changes in investor expectations.

The Interplay of Financial Advantage and Military Might

The research offers several critical insights for understanding
geopolitical dynamics, particularly in terms of the relationship between
the United States and China. "[The United States can dominate militarily
and financially in part because it has deeper financial markets and it
can absorb a lot more capital than everybody else]{.underline},"
explains Yared.

But this [[dominance isn't guaranteed]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the
global financial landscape is evolving. China's efforts to
internationalize the Renminbi (also known as the Chinese Yuan) could
have significant implications.

"We're now in a world where capital is polarizing around a Western bloc
and an Eastern bloc," says Yared. "[If [China]{.mark} does successfully
[internationalize its currency,]{.mark} then that is actually a
[national security threat for the United States]{.mark}.]{.underline}"
That's because a globally accepted Renminbi [would reduce the world's
reliance on the US dollar and allow China to compete more effectively
for global capital,]{.underline} potentially eroding America's financial
and military advantages.

The [research goes on to highlight the interconnectedness of economic
policy and national security]{.underline}. [Events that disrupt
markets]{.underline}, such as debt ceiling crises, [could have
far-reaching consequences.]{.underline} "It's [a national security issue
because]{.underline} it means that, moving forward, the [United States
would have to pay much more to borrow from financial
markets]{.underline} to fund its military," explains Yared.

From the World Stage to Wall Street: Why the Military-Financial Nexus
Has Big Business Implications

Geopolitical events aren't just headlines happening in a vacuum in
far-flung corners of the world. Current tensions ranging from Russia's
ongoing war in Ukraine to war in the Middle East to China's economic
ambitions stand to have tangible impacts on corporate strategies and
financial markets worldwide. Yared elaborates that some analysts believe
we're already in a second Cold War, which has [implications for
significant structural changes in international trade and financial
flows.]{.underline}

In other words, **[the stakes are high]{.underline}**. This research
speaks to future business leaders seeking a framework to anticipate
potentially seismic shifts in the global financial order. "[The US
dollar plays a special role in this world]{.underline}, and our research
provides a way to think about counterfactuals and patterns you can
observe in markets during times of geopolitical stress," says Yared.
"Our study also explores a critical question: Under what circumstances
might the dollar lose its crown as the world's reserve currency?"

#### Here's [more]{.underline} evidence. Military might is [key]{.underline} to the dollar, BUT, its [not]{.underline} invincible[.]{.underline} 

**Yared 24** \[Pierre Yared, MUTB Professor of International Business

financial dominance\", CEPR,

//adiiiiG

The [US today enjoys an unparalleled position]{.underline}, [wielding
both overwhelming military strength and the financial advantage of
borrowing at favourable interest rate]{.underline}s. But this dominance
wasn't preordained -- [it's the result of historical transitions where
military power has repeatedly reshaped the global financial
order.]{.underline}

Consider [Figure 1]{.underline}, which [captures the seismic shifts in
interest rate differentials during periods of geopolitical
upheaval]{.underline}. After WWI, [the US supplanted the UK as the
world's leading financial power]{.underline}, with bond yields flipping
in America's favour (Eichengreen et al. 2012). [A similar dynamic
unfolded earlier]{.underline}, [when the UK emerged as the dominant
power after the Napoleonic Wars]{.underline}, replacing Dutch supremacy.
These reversals underscore a clear pattern: **[financial dominance
follows military might, especially during periods of global
instability.]{.underline}**

Figure 1 Changing military dominance and bond yields in history

\<\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>\>

So, what sets dominant currencies apart? Conventional wisdom credits the
depth of financial markets and robust trade networks (e.g. Eichengreen
2011, Rey et al. 2014). While these factors certainly play a role, they
cannot explain the [striking alignment between military strength and
financial privilege]{.underline}. Figure 2 drives this point home,
showing how [geopolitical crises consistently enhance the US borrowing
advantage]{.underline}. [During the Gulf War, Iraq War, and Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, US bond yields dropped as investors flocked to the
safety of assets issued by a militarily dominant nation]{.underline}.
The conclusion is clear: [military might is not just a supporting
factor; it's a cornerstone of financial supremacy.]{.underline}

Figure 2 Developed country-US borrowing costs vs geopolitical risk

\<\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>\>

Indeed, [victorious powers like the US after WWI and WWII maintained
lower inflation and stronger financial stability]{.underline}, while
vanquished countries faced soaring inflation and crippling debt
devaluation. [Military dominance thus **reassures** investors that a
nation will not suffer the economic chaos of defeat, solidifying
confidence in its relative creditworthiness]{.underline}.

In our working paper (Pflueger and Yared 2024), Carolin Pflueger and I
propose a game-theoretic model that lays bare the self-reinforcing loop
between military and financial dominance. [Military strength enhances
investor confidence in a nation's ability to honour its debts,
especially in times of crisis.]{.underline} Conversely, [financial
dominance allows a hegemon to fund its military at lower borrowing
costs, reinforcing its global standing.]{.underline}

However, **[this system is not invulnerable]{.underline}**. Our model
highlights its fragility: **[a rival with deep financial markets could
upend this cycle, triggering a rapid hegemonic
transition]{.underline}**. For instance, [China's push to
internationalise the renminbi poses a direct challenge to the US
dollar's dominance]{.underline}. A globally accepted Chinese currency
could attract international capital, undermining America's financial
privilege and its ability to sustain military superiority.

Some key takeaways from our research are as follows:

[Prudent debt management supports military dominance.]{.underline} [The
US's ability to tap global financial markets at low interest rates
currently provides it with an important geopolitical
advantage]{.underline}. However, a [loss of
creditworthiness]{.underline} -- whether from high inherited debts or
repeated debt-ceiling standoffs -- [has the potential to threaten both
the US's financial and military status]{.underline}.

ONE-STOP SHOP

The [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [benefits from NATO]{.mark}
leadership in ways that go beyond basing]{.underline}. For the alliance
to function properly, its [[members]{.mark} need to be able to jointly
plan, patrol, and carry out operations]{.underline}. That means **[they
[must use similar]{.mark} sets of [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And
although NATO states are free to purchase any systems that meet alliance
interoperability and capability requirements, in practice,
[[they]{.mark} very often [buy U.S.-made ones]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The advantage of buying American is simple: [European forces are
[more]{.mark} [effective at operating alongside U.S. forces when they
use American systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norwegian and U.S. NATO
patrols in the GIUK Gap, for instance, train on the same systems,
especially the Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft, so that they can seamlessly
coordinate complex joint military operations. Poland and the Baltic
states have prioritized the purchase of High Mobility Artillery Rocket
Systems, known as HIMARS, because when their units and U.S. units need
to hand off patrol duties to each other to ensure round-the-clock
coverage of NATO's eastern frontline, operating with the same equipment
makes the process relatively frictionless. The Polish government is more
likely to get American soldiers patrolling and training with Polish
soldiers every day if they are all working from the same weapons
systems. American leaders, after all, will then have greater confidence
that their soldiers will be effective and safe if the troops fighting
alongside them are using the same technology. [By equipping European
forces with American weapons, eastern allies can encourage Washington to
keep its military in the region.]{.underline}

The reliability of the U.S. defense industrial base and the scale of the
Pentagon's long-term contracts offer additional incentives to use
American weapons. The [American Foreign Military Sales system is
notoriously inefficient]{.underline}, with years-long processes to
finalize contracts and last-minute price increases. But [European
countries still choose U.S. military equipment over their own partly
because American defense contractors, accustomed to servicing the
enormous U.S. armed forces, are typically capable of providing decades'
worth of maintenance, parts, and upgrades]{.underline}. This reliability
is one reason why European countries have inked contracts for
fifth-generation F-35 aircraft despite the high prices and torturous
timelines.

**[[Europe's purchases help the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintain
a strong d]{.mark}efense [i]{.mark}ndustrial
[b]{.mark}ase]{.underline}**. From 2022 to 2024, [European [countries
purchased \$61 billion]{.mark} [worth of U.S. defense
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, accounting for [[34 percent]{.mark} of all
their defense contract procurement]{.underline}, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies. The F-35 alone is worth
billions of dollars to U.S. defense companies. And these deals are
growing in size and scale: since 2020, European NATO allies have more
than doubled the number of weapons they import and increased the
proportion they buy from the United States from 54 percent to 64
percent. [U.S. [military contractors]{.mark} are not just exporting more
to European allies but also [getting a larger share of the continent's
defense spending]{.mark} p]{.underline}ie. Yes, Washington pays more for
defense than Europe does. But [the United States has long enjoyed its
own benefits from this predominance]{.underline}.

### AT: Debt\-\--1AR

#### The OBBB [destroys]{.underline} our national debt. 

**White House 25** \[White House, 6-30-2025, \"The One Big Beautiful

//adiiiiG

President Trump's bold economic agenda, anchored by the historic
pro-growth policies in the One Big Beautiful Bill, will unleash robust,
real economic growth and restore fiscal sanity in America.

Analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) confirms that
President Trump's pro-growth economic policies and reining in wasteful
spending are key to improving the fiscal outlook.  President Trump's
proven economic formula --- historic tax relief, rapid deregulation,
balanced trade, and reining in wasteful spending --- will slash our debt
down to just 94% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Let's be clear: A vote against the One Big Beautiful Bill is a vote for
the largest tax INCREASE --- \$4 trillion --- our nation has ever faced,
which would make our national debt explode to 117% of GDP by 2034

Key findings from the CEA:

Debt-to-GDP falls to 94% by 2034 under the Trump plan --- compared to
117% under Biden's failed path.

Total deficit in 2034 is cut nearly in half --- 3.2% of GDP under Trump
vs. 6.2% under current law---saving the country \$1.1 trillion in that
year alone.

Primary deficits flip to surpluses by 2034 under President Trump's
economic agenda with the OBBB.

An accurate budget score for the OBBB, inclusive of economic growth
unleashed by President Trump's policies, is deficit reduction of \$755
billion relative to the CBO's tax hike baseline and deficit reduction of
\$4.5 trillion relative to the current policy baseline.

President Trump's plan doesn't just grow the economy, it actually
reduces the debt burden on future generations --- something the D.C.
establishment hasn't done in decades.

While Joe Biden supersized the national debt, President Trump is
supersizing hardworking Americans' pay checks and restoring fiscal
sanity, helping solve our debt crisis for the long run. To accomplish
the President's historic economic agenda, we cannot let the Trump tax
cuts expire and we must build on their success with the One Big
Beautiful Bill.

For four years, Democrats in Washington pushed a reckless tax-and-spend

federal spending created, our nation is at a fiscal crossroads. The
status quo is not acceptable or sustainable.

cuts and President Donald Trump's successful America First trade policy,
will prove them wrong once again.

In fact, it is already happening. June saw the first federal budget
surplus in more than nine years, with revenues exceeding spending by
\$26 billion, thanks to a windfall of \$18 billion in new tariff
revenue. While deficits are likely to continue in the near term, this is
a start in the right direction.

The myth that you cannot cut taxes and restore fiscal sanity depends on
dismissing the tax incentives in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that
will drive investment, create jobs, and grow our economy. The simple
truth: They will, and they have before.

Even though the 50-year historic average GDP growth is over 2.7%, the
"nonpartisan" Congressional Budget Office forecasts economic growth will
be just 1.8% in the coming years, and the projected deficit impact of
the "big, beautiful bill" based on that growth would be \$3.3 trillion
over ten years. However, if our nation's economic growth rises just 0.1%
above the historic average and clocks in at 2.8%, federal deficits will
actually be reduced by over half a trillion dollars.

Is this possible? We know it is because in the years following the
passage of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, the United States's economy grew by
2.8%. It can and will happen again.

Increased federal revenues driven by economic growth are just one piece
of the equation. Trump's successful America First trade policy is not
only forcing our trading partners to the table to deliver better deals
for American manufacturers and farmers, but it is also providing tens of
billions of dollars for deficit reduction each month.

Even the CBO predicts that the new tariff policies will generate \$2.5
trillion in new revenue for the federal government over the next 10
years. That is no small sum.

Putting direct tariff revenue aside, as countries come to the table and
more markets open for American producers, our economic growth will
accelerate further. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act and America First
trade policies will turbocharge our entrepreneurs to produce more, hire
more, and invest more here at home. This will only boost revenues
flowing into the federal government further.

While economic growth and tariffs are part of the solution, Congress
must be forced to address the elephant in the room: federal spending.
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act took a massive turn down the correct path
by cutting over \$1.5 trillion in mandatory spending --- the most in
American history.

Complacency and lax oversight for years have allowed spending to
explode, mostly in our nation's social safety net programs. Fraud and
abuse were allowed to run rampant, putting these programs at risk for
the people who truly rely on them.

Through common-sense reforms such as work requirements, which more than
80% of the public supports, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has
eliminated wasteful spending and protected these programs for future
generations. But more must be done.

Economic growth and tariff revenue alone will not save us, but they are
certainly a start. Congress must make responsible decisions in the years
to come to prevent saddling the next generation with even more crippling
debt and economic decline.

Addressing our nation's debt crisis will require a multifaceted,
holistic approach, but Republicans are already taking America down the
right track.

//adiiiiG

BERLIN -- We are inching ever closer to the first global conflict of the
post-Cold War era. Two certainties that kept the Cold War world stable
(albeit still dangerous) no longer hold: the nuclear balance of terror
("mutual assured destruction") and the dominance of the US dollar,
widely seen as a financial nuclear weapon.

These instruments of explosive physical and financial power had a
common, peculiar feature: neither could really be used. To deploy either
option was effectively to destroy oneself, owing to all the rebound
effects, collateral damage, and unintended consequences that would
follow. The power conferred was thus more abstract than concrete.

Now, the situation has changed. There are ongoing conflicts where
someone could well grow frustrated enough to use a nuclear weapon, as
Russian President Vladimir Putin has regularly threatened to do since
invading Ukraine. And the dollar has already been fully weaponized as a
means of deploying financial sanctions and maintaining deterrence.

True, the problems stemming from dollar dominance have been around for a
long time -- so long that those who prophesy its demise tend to be
dismissed like the proverbial boy who cried wolf. In the late 1960s, the
Nobel laureate economist Robert A. Mundell correctly pushed back against
the dollar declinists of his day (mostly in France), issuing a
remarkable three-part prediction that looked improbable at that time.
Namely, he anticipated that the Soviet Union would disintegrate; that
Europe would pursue monetary unification; and that the US dollar would
remain the leading international currency throughout his lifetime. He
turned out to be right on all three counts (he passed away two years
ago).

Today, however, the dollar is increasingly vulnerable to financial
turbulence, readily apparent in bond markets that scrutinize long-term
US public debt. These problems are partly technical, of course; but they
are also political. Without uncertainties about America's long-term
fiscal position, markets would remain calm. But President Joe Biden's
administration has deployed large public investments at a time when the
US Congress has become completely dysfunctional, casting doubt on its
ability even to keep the government running and the debts paid. These
fiscal commitments -- which have produced strong economic growth -- and
the political impasse are both likely to be long-term features of US
governance.

The dollar is also vulnerable because the rest of the world is
connecting the dots behind the US strategy to defend Ukraine against
Russian aggression; Middle East diplomacy, which Hamas has now derailed;
and efforts to preserve the peace in the Taiwan Strait. The dots, of
course, are dollars. As Juan Zarate, a former US deputy national
security adviser, noted a decade ago, sanctions work extremely well
against small and relatively isolated states; but the bigger the target,
the more sanctions will hurt those imposing them.

Yet another reason for the dollar's new vulnerability is that many
Americans have grown deeply suspicious of so-called hyper-globalization
and hyper-financialization. Apparently speaking for many, the Nobel
laureate economist Angus Deaton has published a new book excoriating
other economists for ushering in a world so unequal as to provoke
pitchforks and revolution. The situation in America today, he suggests,
is reminiscent of the social disintegration in late Soviet Russia.

The 2024 US presidential election will bring together all these elements
of dollar chaos, especially if there is a recession in the meantime.
Amid such high financial turbulence, that scenario may add to the appeal
of those proposing that America abandon its post-1945 leadership
role and policy positions. After all, the Biden administration has
already kept most of the Trump-era tariffs, and US talks with the
European Union on tariff reductions and countering Chinese steel exports
in World Trade Organization-compatible ways have failed. There is a very
real danger that both Democrats and Republicans will campaign on
promises to turn away from globalization.

Clearly, the international community needs better guidelines for
managing financial diplomacy, analogous to those developed later during
the Cold War nuclear-arms race. In 1969, the world's superpowers started
taking steps to make the world safer through the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT), a long process that led to the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaties. While containing and restricting the use of nuclear
weapons is still a top priority for the international community,
preventing financial self-destruction should be added to the agenda.

Halting the "nuclearization" of global financial channels means
reconnecting with the themes of the post-1945 settlement. At the Bretton
Woods Conference and the United Nations Conference in San Francisco,
economics and security were considered two sides of the same coin. But
the intimate link between the UN and the Bretton Woods institutions (the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank) was flawed. The five
largest shareholders of the international financial institutions were
also supposed to be the five permanent members of the UN Security
Council. But the veto power wielded by permanent members destroyed that
body's effectiveness, and now the spirit of the veto has seeped into the
Bretton Woods institutions through supermajority voting rules.

With a simpler majority-based decision-making procedure, it would be
possible to institute a judicial process for dealing with and imposing
financial punishments -- including asset seizures -- on rogue states
such as Russia. Monetary Arms Limitation Talks could follow in the
footsteps of SALT, culminating in a Monetary Arms Reduction Treaty.

This should be a top priority. A more robust international monetary
order would generate higher security by creating a stronger global
capacity to police against breaches of peace and stem the alarming
increase in their frequency.

//adiiiiG

In addition, the dollar's role offers a potent alternative
to kinetic military action as a means of pursuing foreign policy
objectives. The dollar's broad use means access to dollar
liquidity---which in turn requires access to the U.S. financial
system---is essential for foreign governments and businesses. For
foreign banks, especially, being cut off from dollar
access is essentially a death sentence. That makes sanctions that do so
a powerful tool in the international arena.

In 2005, for example, the U.S. used the dollar to strike a devastating
blow against North Korea without firing a single shot or even formally
enacting sanctions. Using authority provided by Section 311 of the
Patriot Act, the Department of the Treasury crippled Banco Delta Asia, a
bank accused of facilitating illegal activity by the North Korean
government, by merely threatening to cut off its access to the American
financial system. Deposit outflows began within days; within weeks the
bank was placed under government administration to avoid a full
collapse. Pyongyang was hit hard, as other banks ceased their business
with it to avoid meeting the same fate.

Similarly, though the Trump administration has worked hard to undo
it, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran to limit the
development of nuclear weapons was made possible, in
part, by painful dollar sanctions that brought Iran to the table. Far
from being a proximate cause of military conflict, the dollar's central
global role has often been used to contain
adversaries without military intervention.

Still, skeptics are right to point out that the dollar's role has
indirectly funded American interventionism and that dollar sanctions
have been overused, provoking the ire of American allies. But these
facts suggest we should use our dollar power to forge a more progressive
U.S. order, not abandon the advantage altogether. America's exorbitant
privilege need not fund warships and missiles: The
same low-interest borrowing could be used to fund a new universal health
care system, expand access to higher education, or pursue any number
of large-scale social policy objectives,
including financing global public goods that no other country or
consortium of countries is prepared to fund, such as climate change
mitigation

BRUSSELS (AP) --- The [[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion on Wednesday

[dependency on the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [with a focus on
buying **more defense equipment in Europe**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The EU's executive branch unveiled its "Readiness 2030" security
strategy with the threat of Russian aggression at the forefront of
concerns. NATO intelligence estimates suggest that Russia could be
capable of launching an attack in Europe again in three to five years.

Last month, the Trump administration signaled that U.S. security
priorities lay elsewhere --- on its own borders and in Asia -- and that
Europeans would have to fend for themselves and Ukraine in the future.
That was as Europe's biggest land war in decades entered its fourth
year.

Under the strategy, [[member countries]{.mark} will be [urged to buy

--- in some cases with EU help to cut prices and speed up orders. They
should only purchase equipment from abroad when costs, performance or
supply delays make it preferable.

In recent years, the 27 EU nations have placed about two-thirds of their
orders with U.S. defense companies. To qualify for new loans, they would
have to buy at least 65% of equipment from suppliers in the EU, Norway
or Ukraine.

"[The [security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken

The [United States dollar has had its **worst first six months** of the
year since 1973]{.underline}, as President Donald Trump's economic
policies have prompted global investors to sell their greenback
holdings, threatening the currency's "safe-haven" status.

The [dollar index, which measures the currency's strength against a
basket of six others, including the pound, euro and yen, **fell 10.8
percent** in the first half of 2025]{.underline}.

President Trump's [stop-start tariff war]{.underline}, [and his
attacks]{.underline} that have [led to worries over the independence of
the Federal Reserve]{.underline}, have **[undermined the appeal of the
dollar as a safe bet]{.underline}**. Economists are also worried about
Trump's "[big, beautiful" tax bill]{.underline}, currently under debate
in the US Congress.

The landmark legislation is [expected to add trillions of dollars to the
US debt pile]{.underline} over the coming decade and has [raised
concerns about the sustainability of Washington's
borrowing]{.underline}, prompting an exodus from the US Treasury market.

Meanwhile, [gold has hit record highs this year]{.underline}, on
continued buying by central banks worried about devaluation of their
dollar assets.

What has happened to the dollar?

On April 2, the [Trump administration unveiled tariffs]{.underline} on
imports from most countries around the world, [**denting** confidence in
the world's largest economy and causing a **selloff** in US financial
assets.]{.underline}

[**More than \$5 trillion** was erased from the value of the benchmark
S&P 500 index of shares in the three days after "Liberation
Day"]{.underline}, as Trump described the day of his tariffs
announcement. US Treasuries also saw clear-outs, lowering their price
and sending debt costs for the US government sharply higher.

Faced with a revolt in financial markets, Trump announced a 90-day
pause on tariffs, except for exports from China, on April 9. While trade
tensions with China -- the world's second-largest economy -- have
since eased, [investors remain **wary** of holding dollar-linked
assets]{.underline}.

Last month, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) announced that it had cut its US growth outlook for this year
from 2.2 percent in March to just 1.6 percent, even as inflation has
slowed.

Looking ahead, Republican leaders are trying to push through Trump's One
Big Beautiful Bill Act through Congress before July 4. The bill would
extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, slash healthcare and welfare spending and
increase borrowing.

While some legislators believe it could take until August to pass the
bill, the aim would be to raise the borrowing limit on the country's
\$36.2 trillion debt pile. [The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office
said it would raise Federal debt **by \$3.3 trillion** by
2034.]{.underline}

That would significantly raise the government's debt-to-GDP (gross
domestic product) ratio from 124 percent today, raising concerns about
long-term debt sustainability. Meanwhile, annual deficits -- when state
spending exceeds tax revenues -- would rise to 6.9 percent of GDP from
about 6.4 percent in 2024.

So far, Trump's attempts to lower spending through Elon Musk's
Department of Government Efficiency have fallen short of expectations.
And though import tariffs have raised revenue for the government,
they've been paid for -- in the form of higher costs -- by American
consumers.

The upshot is that Trump's unpredictable policies, which prompted
Moody's rating agency to strip the US government of its top credit
score in May, have slowed US growth prospects this year and dented the
demand for its currency.

The dollar has also trended down on expectations that the Federal
Reserve will cut interest rates to support the United States' economy,
urged on by Trump, with two to three reductions expected by the end of
this year, according to levels implied by futures contracts.

Is the US becoming a 'less attractive' destination?

Owing to its dominance in trade and finance, the dollar has been the
world's currency anchor. In the 1980s, for instance, many Gulf countries
began pegging their currencies to the greenback.

Its influence doesn't stop there. Though the US accounts for one-quarter
of global GDP, 54 percent of world exports were denominated in dollars
in 2023, according to the Atlantic Council.

Its dominance in finance is even greater. About 60 percent of all bank
deposits are denominated in dollars, while nearly 70 percent of
international bonds are quoted in the US currency.

Meanwhile, 57 percent of the world's foreign currency reserves -- assets
held by central banks -- are held in dollars, according to the IMF.

But the dollar's reserve status is supported by confidence in the US
economy, its financial markets and its legal system.

And Trump is changing that. Karsten Junius, chief economist at Bank J
Safra Sarasin, says "investors are beginning to realise that they're
over-exposed to US assets."

Indeed, foreigners own \$19 trillion of US equities, \$7 trillion of US
Treasuries and \$5 trillion of US corporate bonds, according to Apollo
Asset Management.

If investors continue to trim their positions, [the dollar's value could
continue to come under sustained pressure]{.underline}.

"**[The US has become a less attractive place to invest these days... US
assets are not as safe as they used to be]{.underline}**," Junius told
Al Jazeera.

What are the consequences of a lower-value dollar?

Many within the Trump administration argue that the costs of the US
dollar's reserve status outweigh the benefits -- because that raises the
cost of US exports.

Stephen Miran, chair of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, has said
high dollar valuations place "undue burdens on our firms and workers,
making their products and labour uncompetitive on the global stage".

"The dollar's overvaluation has been one factor contributing to the US's
loss of competitiveness over the years, and... tariffs are a reaction to
this unpleasant reality," he added.

At first blush, [a lower dollar would indeed make US goods cheaper to
overseas buyers and make imports more expensive]{.underline}, [helping
to reduce the country's trade deficits]{.underline}. However, these
typical trade effects remain in flux due to ongoing tariff threats.

For developing countries, a [weaker greenback will lower the local
currency cost of repaying dollar debt]{.underline}, [providing relief to
heavily indebted countries like Zambia, Ghana or Pakistan.]{.underline}

Elsewhere, [a weaker dollar should boost commodity prices, increasing
export revenues for countries exporting oil, metals or agricultural
goods such as Indonesia, Nigeria and Chile]{.underline}.

Have other currencies done well?

Since the start of Trump's second term in office, [the greenback's slide
has upended widespread predictions that his trade war would do greater
damage to economies outside the US, while also spurring US
inflation]{.underline} -- strengthening the currency against its rivals.

Instead, the **[euro has risen 13 percent]{.underline}** to above
\$1.[17 as investors continue to focus on growth risks inside the
US]{.underline}. At the same time, [demand has **risen** for other safe
assets like German and French government bonds]{.underline}.

For American investors, the [weaker dollar has also encouraged equity
investments abroad]{.underline}. The Stoxx 600 index, a broad measure
across European stocks, has risen roughly 15 percent since the start of
2025.

Converted back into dollars, that **[gain amounts to 23
percent]{.underline}**.

**[The [path ahead]{.mark} may [not look much
brighter]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

That's because many of the same factors --- [[policy volatility]{.mark},
[swelling debt]{.mark} and [deficits]{.mark} and [potential]{.mark}
[interest rate cuts]{.mark} from the Federal Reserve]{.underline}, just
to name a few --- [likely [will stay on the minds of investors]{.mark}
as they seek other avenues for safe havens.]{.underline}

"Some of this was probably due, and then we've certainly given currency
traders enough to contemplate for what's the catalyst now," said Art
Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. "You could
check a lot of boxes. You're running massive deficits, and nobody wants
to stop that on either side of the aisle. You're alienating friends both
militarily and trade-wise. You've got enough potential negative
catalysts. And then once momentum starts, it's hard to kind of stop it."

Indeed, the dollar's slide started in mid-January and has shown only
occasional signs of moderating since. Hopes that President Donald
Trump's tariffs would not be as steep as thought helped spark a brief
rally in mid-April, but for the most part the gravitational pull has
been lower.

Market impact

Of course, the dollar's slide hasn't exactly been poison for stocks.

With more than 40% of revenue for S&P 500 companies coming from
international sales, a weaker dollar helps make American exports
cheaper, an important point to consider amid the ongoing trade war.

However, the move lower has coincided with growing chatter about the
potential end of American exceptionalism and dollar hegemony, with the
public share of U.S. debt nearing \$30 trillion and the 2025 deficit on
track for close to \$2 trillion. Should American assets such as the
greenback and Treasury debt lose their prominence on the global stage,
that could have strong ramifications for risk assets like stocks.

Global central banks, for one, are ramping up their gold purchases, to
24 tons a month, per the World Gold Council, as an alternative to U.S.
assets. Gold had its best first-half run since 1979.

"We think central banks are buying gold to diversify reserves, reduce
reliance on the \[dollar\], and hedge against inflation and economic
uncertainty," Lawson Winder, research analyst at Bank of America, said
in a note. Winder said it's "A trend that we think is set to continue,
especially amid uncertainty surrounding US tariffs and fiscal deficit
concerns."

Likewise, TS Lombard is maintaining a short position on the greenback,
which it calls "the gift that keeps on giving."

"[[Trump's attacks on the Fed]{.mark} and the administration's [explicit
desire for a weaker dollar]{.mark} only add to that view,]{.underline}"
wrote Daniel Von Ahlen, senior macro strategist at the firm. "[The
[dollar remains]{.mark} [overvalued]{.mark}]{.underline} on most FX
metrics \... With USD negatives ubiquitous, why not expect the dollar to
become undervalued? We remain firmly short dollar across a range of
trades in our book."

France, and other EU nations have proposed significant defense budgets

meeting or exceeding the 2% GDP defense spending target---not because of
Trump's demands, but because they increasingly see no other choice.

[Independent [Military]{.mark} [Capabilities]{.mark}:]{.underline} The
European Union has launched new defense initiatives, such as the €800

independent of the United States.

[[New]{.mark} Strategic [Alliances]{.mark}:]{.underline} European
leaders are exploring closer security ties with each other and with
emerging global powers, signaling a shift away from automatic alignment
with Washington.

The United States as a Potential Threat

This reassessment of America's role is not merely about reliability; it
is about risk. Under balance-of-threat theory, states align against
actors they perceive as dangerous. Traditionally, Europe viewed Russia
as the primary threat---hence NATO's post-Cold War expansion. But if the
United States becomes an unreliable, erratic, or destabilizing force,
then it too becomes something European nations must hedge against.

For decades, U.S. foreign policy was guided by a kind of implicit
bargain: America provided stability, and in return, allies followed its
lead. But realism tells us that alliances are not permanent; they exist
only as long as they serve mutual interests. If Trump---or any future
U.S. president---continues to weaken these foundations, Europe will
adapt. And adaptation means shifting from dependence on the U.S. to a
world where Europe is prepared to act independently---even if that means
counterbalancing American influence.

The [[End of American Primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}?

From a realist perspective, this is the natural course of international
relations. Hegemonic powers do not last forever. As Waltz predicted,
unipolarity is inherently unstable; other states will eventually seek to
balance against the dominant power. That process is now
accelerating---not because of China, Russia, or any external force, but
because of the actions of the United States itself.

Trump may not have intended to dismantle America's global position, but
if the world no longer trusts the United States as a stabilizing force,
then the end of American primacy will not come from foreign
challengers---it will come from within.

What This Means for Americans: A World Where Europe Acts Alone

For the average American, the idea of Europe developing its own military
power independent of the United States may seem abstract---something for
policymakers and defense analysts to worry about. Undoubtedly for some
in MAGA (and the President's supporters), they'll cheer it, wrongly
believing that Europe is a freeloader. Average Americans may also share
this view, thinking they'll always be the "top dog," despite whatever
comes down the pike.

The reality is that this shift carries profound consequences for U.S.
influence, economic stability, and even national security. What Trump is
doing is playing "Russian Roulette" with our national survival. Each
misstep, we spin the revolver, put it to our head, and pull the trigger.
Eventually, we're going to catch that bullet. This is a question of
when, not if.

For nearly 80 years, the United States has been the primary security
guarantor for Europe. This arrangement wasn't just about protecting
allies---it gave the U.S. enormous leverage over European political and
economic decisions. For a guy who claims to be a genius businessman, the
reality of this fact is ignored, or outright lied about. We run the
world the way it is because it benefits us. These people aren't
freeloaders, but our servants, or at least they were.

American leadership in NATO ensured that European nations aligned with
U.S. interests, followed Washington's lead in global crises, and
remained economically and militarily dependent on American power. When
that changes---if Europe becomes a fully independent military
power---then the U.S. loses one of its greatest strategic advantages. At
best, we become a powerful actor attempting to survive in a multi-polar
world. At worst, the wealth, power, prestige, and safety Americans
enjoyed for five generations will evaporate in less than a decade; all
for lies, defamatory statements, and capricious desires of a fatally
flawed felon who was elected President.

The [Loss of Strategic Leverage]{.underline}

One of the biggest benefits of the current system is that the United
States, as [[Europe's]{.mark} primary military protector, effectively
[sets the terms of transatlantic policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} That's why
Europe has followed the U.S. on key foreign policy issues---sanctions
against adversaries, military interventions, and diplomatic positioning.
Despite all of the "bullshit," and defamatory remarks from Republicans
and Trump, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan have
followed the U.S. [Our [allies have been there for us,]{.mark}
economically, militarily, and politically]{.underline}. They might not
have done exactly what we wanted, but not once have any of them ever
stood opposed to us.

That's going to end thanks to the President.

**[A [militarily independent Europe]{.mark} would [no longer need to
align with Washington]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, it is doubtful
that it will align itself with our interests at all absent the security
and economic ties that have bound us for generations. If European
nations have the ability to defend themselves without U.S. assistance,
they also can ignore U.S. pressure. Donald Trump likes to talk about
"Fuck you," money; in international affairs, military capability is
"Fuck you," money.

When Trump destroys the international framework, this is what Americans
can look forward to:

[[Less U.S. control over economic policy]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[Europe]{.mark} would be free to [trade with]{.mark} [adversaries like
China and Russia]{.mark} without fear of U.S. retaliation. If Washington
pushes for sanctions, Europe could refuse. That would effectively make
the US's leadership position impotent. While the [US is the largest
market]{.mark}, it's [only]{.mark} the largest [as long as it controls
trade and econ]{.mark}omics. If it loses its leverage to coordinate the
other developed economies of the world, nearly half of **[our soft (and
hard power) evaporates with that choice.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[More divergence on military action]{.underline} -- Europe would no
longer be obligated to participate in U.S.-led interventions. If America
wanted European support in a conflict---whether in the Middle East,
Asia, or elsewhere---European leaders could decline without fear of
losing U.S. security guarantees. Even more problematic, would be if
[Europe takes a position against the United States.]{.underline}

A [[competing power in global]{.mark} affairs]{.underline} -- Instead of
working as Washington's junior partner, [[Europe]{.mark} could [emerge
as an independent pole]{.mark} in a multipolar world, negotiating its
alliances and setting policies [that]{.mark} may [contradict U.S.
interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the US and its allies have been
aligned, in an environment where the U.S. is antagonistic,
[[Europe]{.mark} will [undoubtedly move to]{.mark} [undermine the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In this regard, Trump's legacy will
be to have destroyed the ability of the U.S. to be "the leader of the
free world." [**[At best, we'd be relegated to being just another
voice]{.mark}.** Again, that's "at best."]{.underline}

**[[fractured alliance means]{.mark} a [less

ourselves with Russia and China.

This could manifest in several ways:

[[America]{.mark} could [find itself]{.mark} alone, or at worst
[opposed, in major global conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the U.S.
engages in a standoff with China over Taiwan, or a military
confrontation with Iran, [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} could decide to
remain neutral---or even act as a mediator rather than an ally. Or
worse, given power politics, they [could actively [undermine the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Given their knowledge of our
strategy, training, doctrine, capabilities, intelligence gathering,
etc., this [would prove FATAL]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[capability to challenge U.S. dominance in global institutions]{.mark}

and summary\] //adiiiiG

In the middle of the 20th century, after decades of war that ravaged
societies and economies, American leaders and their counterparts
recognized that a peaceful, integrated world was needed to more
effectively advance national interests. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [served as the]{.mark} [architect and anchor
of]{.mark} this [global order]{.mark} ever since, creating the
alliances, institutions, and norms that set its terms and
conditions:]{.underline} trade conducted in U.S. dollars, security
partnerships underwritten by American military power, and democracy
premised on a separation of powers with attendant political rights and
freedoms. For nearly a century, American leaders have recognized that
global problems require cooperation and mechanisms to resolve
differences in ways that avoid costly wars and economic destruction.
Because of this project, Americans today have lived more prosperous,
peaceful, and free lives than those of previous generations.

[Yet [**just 100 days** into his second term]{.mark}, [President]{.mark}
Donald [Trump's]{.mark} [approach to foreign policy has]{.mark}
[**rapidly reshaped** this global order, **dismantling** the foundations
of U.S. leadership]{.mark} in the world. President Trump **has [pushed
away]{.mark}**---or deliberately threatened1---[American allies]{.mark}
and trade partners, [leaving the United States **more isolated**]{.mark}
on the world stage]{.underline}. Since his inauguration on January 20,
2025, [Trump has [engaged in **trade wars**]{.mark} that have raised
consumer costs, **[tanked markets]{.mark}**, and [**jeopardized**
economic partnerships]{.mark};**2[undermined]{.mark}** [U.S. commitment
to NATO]{.mark}, [creating **ruptures** with]{.mark} transatlantic
[allies]{.mark}; **[dismantled]{.mark}** U.S. [foreign
assistance]{.mark} programs that [**exemplify** U.S. leadership]{.mark}
and generate global stability;3 [and **pulled** the United States out of
global compacts]{.mark} on climate, health, and human rights that make
the world a safer place for all.4 ]{.underline}While these acts
undoubtedly affect millions all over the world, they also have already
had real impacts here at home, [jeopardizing Americans' security and
causing economic strife]{.underline} in only a few short weeks.

President Trump's destructive foreign policy is not wholly
unexpected---after all, he rode into office on a wave of American
discontent around the status quo.5 [While [decades of U.S.
global]{.mark} [leadership]{.mark} have delivered greater wealth and
security to many]{.underline}, t**[he benefits of this order [have been
unequally
distributed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.6 [**[Millions]{.underline}** [of
jobs have moved overseas]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2001,7 because the
[so-called "[China shock]{.mark}" and a "[race to the bottom]{.mark}"
[incentivized low costs and efficiency above]{.mark} [all
else]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 [[The top 10 percent of the world's
population now **owns more than three-quarters** of global
wealth]{.underline}]{.mark},9 and [[the United States has the
**largest** wealth inequality]{.mark} among developed
nations.]{.underline}10 America's [long [reliance on fossil
fuels]{.mark} has [enriched oil and gas tycoons while generating climate
disaster]{.mark}s]{.underline} that hit poor communities
hardest.11 Beltway insiders have supported [[military adventurism
in]{.mark} conflicts such as those in [Vietnam]{.mark}, [Iraq]{.mark},
and [Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}---at [[great financial cost to
American taxpayers]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[loss of life to American
families]{.underline},]{.mark} and [[devastation to civilian populations
on the ground]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 In recent decades, discontent over
this kind of fundamental unfairness has often fueled a populist rise of
the far right.13

But rather than implementing policies that mitigate this unfairness,
[Trump is exacerbating it, placing political loyalists and business
affiliates in critical leadership positions]{.underline}14---even though
many of these appointees have clear interests that conflict with those
of the American people.15 Courting the influence of oligarchs and
authoritarians abroad, Trump and his billionaire allies have been able
to further their interests16 as they advance economic policies that will
only widen the inequality gap.17 While pushing away allies, Trump has
kowtowed to adversaries with vested interest in undermining American
democracy and prosperity.18

President Trump says that this approach is about putting "America
first," but *the record of his first 100 days is clear*: **[[Trump's
foreign policy has left America weak, and Americans are paying the
price.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

//adiiiiG

For decades, the [[**general consensus** was that]{.mark} in the
international [policies of]{.mark} the European Union
([EU]{.mark}),]{.underline} [commercial interests [prevailed]{.mark}
over wider foreign policy strategy]{.underline}. **[[In a major
shift]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[EU]{.mark} institutions and European
leaders now [claim]{.mark} that [this stance **no longer
holds**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The EU has [[gradually moved
toward]{.mark} a [new economic statecraft]{.mark} that is more [infused
with geopolitical aims]{.mark} and considerations]{.underline}. EU
member states have converged on a shared assessment that [the
[weaponization of interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline} requires
jettisoning the neat distinction between economic and security affairs.
The [emerging European economic statecraft encompasses a wide range of
measures]{.underline}: Some aim to establish a level playing field with
competitors, while others pursue broader external agendas, such as
environmental sustainability or human rights.

[The EU's new statecraft is [not only defensive but]{.mark} also
[contains offensive measures against other powers]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some of these powers complain that [many [new EU measures **are a risk
to the liberal order** that the]{.mark} [union claims to defend]{.mark}
as its long-term strategic interest.]{.underline} Increasingly, the EU's
narrative is about making interdependence safe for the EU rather than
the wider political-strategic aim of mutually beneficial global reforms.
A [[backlash from other states]{.mark} risks
[deepen]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the strategic
[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} that the economic security approach is
designed to address.

That is why economic statecraft in a volatile and fast-changing world
is, to some extent, experimental. An excessive focus on economic
security risks generating harmful unintended consequences. To move
forward effectively with this agenda, the EU needs to define the larger
goals that economic statecraft is supposed to serve, assess the
political and strategic externalities of different policies, and tackle
the trade-offs between competing priorities. This is the task for EU
institutions and member states in the years ahead.

In a conflict-prone postneoliberal world, these developments require a
new examination of the global ambitions and strategies of the
EU---traditionally a weak foreign policy player but a strong economic
actor. As a pillar of multilateralism, the EU has contributed to and
benefited from the rules-based order that is now being challenged. If
the EU wants to play a role in this emerging landscape, it needs to
adapt its political economic model and craft an external policy fit for
purpose.

Adapting to the emerging international environment may mean altering
policies and approaches that have been carefully embedded in a set of
liberal norms. Building greater European strategic autonomy and internal
resilience may entail a shift away from these norms, raising questions
about the EU's global standing. Such a shift would also require far
greater coherence between the union's internal and external policies.

Internally, the search for a new paradigm for the EU's political economy
is challenging, as it represents a departure from the rules-based
principles of multilateralism. The compromise found in the notion of
open strategic autonomy leaves much room for ambiguity, discretion, and
problems of definition. The EU will need to craft an industrial strategy
that strikes the right balance between the bloc's aspiration to support
key industries and the imperative to maintain fair competition in the
single market.

Externally, the EU will need to navigate the complexities of ensuring
that its economic statecraft remains as compatible as possible with the
bloc's commitments to multilateral rules. As the traditional champion of
a liberal, rules-based regime, the EU has a special responsibility to
protect global multilateralism.

The success of the EU's policy agenda will thus depend on the union's
ability to pursue its interests while upholding global rules. Although
the EU may see its economic statecraft as necessary to fulfill the
bloc's ambition of economic resilience, globally there are concerns
about the potential unintended effects of this approach. The external
implications of the EU's burgeoning economic statecraft will require the
union to engage in diplomacy to mitigate the impacts of its domestic
measures on the multilateral order.

Meanwhile, finding the right balance between economic security and
broader foreign policy goals will be crucial for the EU to maintain
credibility and legitimacy on the global stage. The union should
therefore foster an international engagement strategy to make its
practice of economic statecraft compatible with the broader development
concerns of the rest of the world.

The EU should, in essence, relearn the art of the strategic management
of interdependence. The union should seek to be both strategic and open.
Ultimately, the EU's ability to address the challenges of global
turmoil, shifting political realities, and the demands of its member
states will determine its future trajectory in a rapidly evolving world.

Introduction

Rosa Balfour and Sinan Ülgen

European integration reached its peak in the 1990s. The European single
market deepened economic interdependence on the continent. The
attractiveness of that market made the European Union (EU) a global
partner in bilateral and regional trade deals. The end of the Cold War
enabled the EU's enlargement to Northern and then Central Europe. And,
by leveraging Europe's interdependence and with strong public support,
the EU made its first steps in foreign and security policy.

At that time, economics served the broad geopolitical goal of supporting
the post--Cold War order in Europe---just as it had supported the
post--World War II order. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, projecting
the European model worldwide became the external corollary to the EU's
internal success: The prevailing liberal, rules-based approach to
international economic relations helped defuse tensions and regulate
global politics.

Thirty years later, **[the [EU's strength]{.mark} has [turned into a
liability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is now a [[drive toward]{.mark}
a [politicization]{.mark} of the international economy]{.underline},
while [[rising]{.mark} geopolitical [tensions]{.mark} impact on
economics]{.underline}, security, and technology at a time when European
countries are transitioning toward a green and digital economy. [[Rather
than]{.mark} a conduit for [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [economic
[interdependence]{.mark} has become [subjected to
**weaponization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 Together, several factors are
challenging the world in which European integration was possible: the
unraveling of the neoliberal order, the "fuzzy bifurcation" between
globalization and geopolitics (according to political scientist Richard
Higgott), war in Europe and the Middle East, and the simultaneous trends
of accelerated technological change and the climate crisis.2

Existential Threats to Humanity," vol. 3\] //adiiiiG

As we enter the third decade of the 21st century, humanity faces so many
issues and questions, that it is really hard to know what to focus on.
So I would like to use the next 20 minutes to help us focus on all the
different issues we face. [Three problems pose **[existential
challenges]{.mark}** to our species]{.underline}.

[These three]{.underline} existential [challenges [are
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear [war]{.mark}**[, **eco**]{.mark}logical
[**collapse** and **tech**]{.mark}nological **disruption**]{.underline}.
We should focus on them.

Now nuclear war and ecological collapse are already familiar threats, so
let me spend some time explaining the less-familiar threat posed by
technological disruption.

In Davos, we hear so much about the enormous promises of technology ---
and these promises are certainly real. But [technology
might]{.underline} also [disrupt human society and the very meaning of
human life in **numerous ways**, ranging from the creation
of]{.underline} a global useless class to the rise of [**data
colonialism** and of digital **dictatorships**]{.underline}.

Socio-Economic Upheaval

Automation will soon eliminate millions upon millions of jobs, and while
new jobs will certainly be created, it is unclear whether people will be
able to learn the necessary new skills fast enough. Suppose you are a
50-year-old truck driver, and you just lost your job to a self-driving
vehicle. Now there are new jobs in designing software or in teaching
yoga to engineers --- but how does a 50-year-old truck driver reinvent
himself or herself as a software engineer or as a yoga teacher? And
people will have to do it not just once but again and again throughout
their lives, because the automation revolution will not be a single
watershed event following which the job market will settle down into a
new equilibrium. Rather, it will be a cascade of ever bigger
disruptions, because artificial intelligence (AI) is nowhere near its
full potential.

Old jobs will disappear, new jobs will emerge, but then the new jobs
will rapidly change and vanish. Whereas in the past humans had to
struggle against exploitation, in the 21st century, the really big
struggle will be against irrelevance. And it is much worse to be
irrelevant than exploited.

Those who fail in the struggle against irrelevance would constitute a
new 'useless class' --- people who are useless not from the viewpoint of
their friends and family, but useless from the viewpoint of the economic
and political system. And this useless class will be separated by an
ever-growing gap from the ever more powerful elite.

The AI Revolution Creating Unprecedented Inequality Between Classes and
Countries

In the 19th century, a few countries like Britain and Japan
industrialised first, and they went on to conquer and exploit most of
the world. If we are not careful, the same thing will happen in the 21st
century with AI.

We are already in the midst of an AI arms race, with China and the US
leading the race, and most countries being left far, far behind. Unless
we take action to distribute the benefit and power of AI between all
humans, AI will likely create immense wealth in a few high-tech hubs,
while other countries will either go bankrupt or become exploited data
colonies.

Now we are not talking here about a science fiction scenario of robots
rebelling against humans. We are talking about far more primitive AI,
which is nevertheless enough to disrupt the global balance.

Just think what will happen to developing economies once it is cheaper
to produce textiles or cars in California than in Mexico? And what will
happen to politics in your country in 20 years, when somebody in San
Francisco or Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history of
every politician, every judge and every journalist in your country,
including all their sexual escapades, all their mental weaknesses and
all their corrupt dealings? Will it still be an independent country or
will it become a data colony?

When you have enough data, you do not need to send soldiers in order to
control a country.

The Rise of Digital Dictatorships and Global Monitoring

This danger can be stated in the form of a simple equation, which I
think might be the defining equation of life in the 21st century:

B ×C×D =AHH!

Which means? Biological knowledge multiplied by computing power
multiplied by data equals the ability to hack humans, ahh!

If you know enough biology and have enough computing power and data, you
can hack my body and my brain and my life, and you can understand me
better than I understand myself. You can know my personality type, my
political views, my sexual preferences, my mental weaknesses, my deepest
fears and hopes. You know more about me than I know about myself. And
you can do that not just to me, but to everyone.

A system that understands us better than we understand ourselves can
predict our feelings and decisions, can manipulate our feelings and
decisions and can ultimately make decisions for us.

Now in the past, many governments and tyrants wanted to do it, but
nobody understood biology well enough, and nobody had enough computing
power and data to hack millions of people. Neither the Gestapo nor the
KGB could do it. But soon at least some corporations and governments
will be able to systematically hack all the people. We humans should get
used to the idea that we are no longer mysterious souls --- we are now
hackable animals. That is what we are.

The power to hack humans can be used for good purposes --- like
providing much better healthcare. But if this power falls into the hands
of a 21st-century Stalin, the result will be the worst totalitarian
regime in human history. And we already have a number of applicants for
the job of 21stcentury Stalin.

Just imagine North Korea in 20 years, when everybody has to wear a
biometric bracelet that constantly monitors your blood pressure, your
heart rate, your brain activity 24 hours a day. You listen to a speech
on the radio by the great leader, and they know what you actually feel.
You can clap your hands and smile, but if you are angry, they know, you
will be in the gulag tomorrow.

And if we allow the emergence of such total surveillance regimes, do not
think that the rich and powerful in places like Davos will be safe, just
ask Jeff Bezos. In Stalin's USSR, the state monitored members of the
communist elite more than anyone else. The same will be true of future
total surveillance regimes. The higher you are in the hierarchy --- the
more closely you will be watched.

Do you want your chief executive officer or your president to know what
you really think about them?

So it is in the interest of all humans, including the elites, to prevent
the rise of such digital dictatorships. And in the meantime, if you get
a suspicious WhatsApp message, from some Prince, do not open it.

Now if we indeed prevent the establishment of digital dictatorships, the
ability to hack humans might still undermine the very meaning of human
freedom. Because as humans will rely on AI to make more and more
decisions for us, authority will shift from humans to algorithms and
this is already happening.

Already today billions of people trust the Facebook algorithm to tell us
what is new, the Google algorithm tells us what is true, Netflix tells
us what to watch, and the Amazon and Alibaba algorithms tell us what to
buy.

In the not-so-distant future, similar algorithms might tell us where to
work and who to marry, and also decide whether to hire us for a job,
whether to give us a loan, and whether the central bank should raise the
interest rate.

And if you ask why you were not given a loan, and why you the bank did
not raise the interest rate, the answer will always be the same ---
because the computer says no. And as the limited human brain lacks
sufficient biological knowledge, computing power and data --- humans
will simply not be able to understand the computer's decisions.

So even in supposedly free countries, humans are likely to lose control
over our own lives and also lose the ability to understand public
policy.

Already now, how many humans understand the financial system? Maybe 1
per cent, to be very generous. In a couple of decades, the number of
humans capable of understanding the financial system will be exactly
zero.

Now we humans are used to thinking about life as a drama of
decision-making. What will be the meaning of human life when most
decisions are taken by algorithms? We do not even have philosophical
models to understand such an existence.

The usual bargain between philosophers and politicians is that
philosophers have a lot of fanciful ideas, and politicians basically
explain that they lack the means to implement these ideas. Now we are in
an opposite situation. We are facing philosophical bankruptcy.

[The twin revolutions of **[info]{.mark}tech** [and **biotech**]{.mark}
are]{.underline} now [giving politicians the means to **create heaven or
hell**]{.underline}, but the philosophers are having trouble
conceptualising what the new heaven and the new hell will look like. And
that is a very dangerous situation.

[If we fail to conceptualise]{.underline} the new [heaven quickly
enough, we might be easily **misled** by **naïve utopias**]{.underline}.
And if we fail to conceptualise the new hell quickly enough, [we might
[find ourselves **entrapped**]{.mark} there [with **no way
out**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Technological disruption of not just our economy, politics and
philosophy but also our biology

In the coming decades, [AI and biotechnology will give us]{.underline}
godlike [abilities to **reengineer life**, and]{.underline} even to
[create]{.underline} completely [new life forms. After four billion
years of]{.underline} organic life shaped by [natural selection, we are
about to enter]{.underline} a new era of inorganic life shaped by
[intelligent design]{.underline}.

Our intelligent design is going to be the new driving force of the
evolution of life and in using our new divine powers of creation, [we
might make **mistakes** on a **cosmic scale**]{.underline}. In
particular, governments, corporations and armies are likely to use
technology to enhance human skills that they need --- like intelligence
and discipline --- while neglecting other humans skills -- like
compassion, artistic sensitivity and spirituality.

The result might be a race of humans who are very intelligent and very
disciplined but lack compassion, artistic sensitivity and spiritual
depth. Of course, this is not a prophecy. These are just possibilities.
Technology is never deterministic.

In the 20th century, people used the same industrial technology to build
very different kinds of societies: fascist dictatorships, communist
regimes, liberal democracies. The same thing will happen in the 21st
century.

[AI and biotech will]{.underline} certainly [transform the world, but we
can use them to create]{.underline} very [different kinds of
societies]{.underline}. And if you are afraid of some of the
possibilities I have mentioned, you can still do something about it. But
[[to do something **effective**, we need **global
coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}.

Global Problems that Demand Global Solutions

Whenever a leader says something like 'My country first!' we should
remind that leader that [[no nation]{.mark} can [prevent]{.mark}
**nuclear [war]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} stop **ecological
[collapse]{.mark}** [by itself]{.mark}, and **no nation** can regulate
AI and bioengineering **by itself**]{.underline}.

Almost every country will say, 'Hey, we don't want to develop killer
robots or to genetically engineer human babies. We are the good guys.
But we can't trust our rivals not to do it. So we must do it first'.

[[If we allow]{.mark} such [an **arms race**]{.mark} to develop
in]{.underline} fields like [**AI** and **bio**engineering, it does
not]{.underline} really matter [who wins]{.underline} the arms race ---
[[the **loser will be humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Unfortunately, just [when **global coop**eration is]{.underline} more
[needed]{.underline} than ever before, some of [the most
powerful]{.underline} leaders and [countries]{.underline} in the world
[are]{.underline} now [deliberately **undermining** global
cooperation]{.underline}. Leaders like the US president tell us that
there is an inherent contradiction between nationalism and globalism,
and that we should choose nationalism and reject globalism.

But this is a dangerous mistake. There is no contradiction between
nationalism and globalism. Because nationalism is not about hating
foreigners. Nationalism is about loving your compatriots. And in the
21st century, in order to protect the safety and the future of your
compatriots, you must cooperate with foreigners.

So in the 21st century, good nationalists must be also globalists. Now
globalism does not mean establishing a global government, abandoning all
national traditions or opening the border to unlimited immigration.
Rather, [[globalism means]{.mark} a [commitment to]{.mark}]{.underline}
some **[global [rules]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Rules]{.underline} that [do not deny]{.underline} the uniqueness of
[each nation, but]{.underline} only [regulate the relations between
nations]{.underline}.

The World Cup: An Effective Model for Global Cooperation

The World Cup is a competition between nations, and people often show
fierce loyalty to their national team. But at the same time, the World
Cup is also an amazing display of global harmony. France cannot play
football against Croatia unless the French and the Croatians agree on
the same rules for the game. And that is globalism in action.

If you like the World Cup --- you are already a globalist.

Now hopefully, [nations could **agree** on **global rules**]{.underline}
not just for football, but also for how [[to **prevent**]{.mark}
**eco**logical **[collapse]{.mark}**, how to **[regulate]{.mark}**
dangerous **[techn]{.mark}ologies** and how to reduce **global
inequality**]{.underline}. How to make sure, for example, that AI
benefits Mexican textile workers and not only American software
engineers. Now of course, [[this is]{.mark} going to b]{.underline}e
much more [[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} than football ---
[[but]{.mark} **not impossible**]{.underline}. Because the impossible,
well we have already accomplished the impossible.

[We have already escaped the **violent jungle** in which]{.underline} we
[humans]{.underline} have [lived]{.underline} throughout history. [For
thousands of years, humans]{.underline} lived under the law of the
jungle [in a condition of **omnipresent war**]{.underline}. The law of
the jungle said that for every two nearby countries, there is a
plausible scenario that they will go to war against each other next
year. Under this law, peace meant only 'the temporary absence of war'.

When there was 'peace' between --- say --- Athens and Sparta, or France
and Germany, it meant that now they are not at war, but next year they
might be. And [for thousands of years, people]{.underline} had
[assumed]{.underline} that [it was impossible to escape]{.underline}
this law.

[But in the last few decades]{.underline}, humanity has managed to do
the impossible, to break the law and to escape the jungle. [We have
built the **rule-based** [lib]{.mark}eral **global [order]{.mark}**
that]{.underline}, despite many imperfections, has nevertheless
[[created the most]{.mark} **prosperous** and **most [peaceful]{.mark}**
[era in]{.mark} **human [history]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Peace has changed

['Peace' no longer means]{.underline} just [the]{.underline} temporary
[**absence** of war. Peace now means the **implausibility of
war**]{.underline}.

[There are many countries]{.underline} that [you]{.underline} simply
[**cannot** imagine going to war]{.underline} against each other next
year --- [like France and Germany]{.underline}. There are still wars in
some parts of the world. I come from the Middle East, so believe me, I
know this perfectly well. But it should not blind us to the overall
global picture.

We are now living in a world in which war kills fewer people than
suicide, and gunpowder is far less dangerous to your life than sugar.
Most countries --- with some notable exceptions like Russia --- do not
even fantasise about conquering and annexing their neighbours. Which is
why most countries can afford to spend maybe just about 2 per cent of
their gross domestic product on defence, while spending far, far more on
education and healthcare. This is not a jungle.

Unfortunately, [we have gotten so used to this]{.underline} wonderful
[situation that we take it for granted, and]{.underline} we
[are]{.underline} therefore [becoming extremely careless. [Instead of
doing everything]{.mark} we can [to **strengthen** the]{.mark} **fragile
global [order]{.mark}**[, countries **neglect** it]{.mark}
and]{.underline} even deliberately [undermine it]{.underline}.

[The global order is]{.underline} now like [a house that **everybody**
inhabits and **nobody repairs**. [It can **hold on** for a few]{.mark}
more [years, but]{.mark}]{.underline} if we continue like this, [it
[will **collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[and]{.mark} we will find
ourselves back in the **jungle** of **omnipresent war**]{.underline}.

We have forgotten what it is like, but believe me as a historian --- you
do not want to be back there. It is far, far worse than you imagine.

Yes, our species has evolved in that jungle and lived and even prospered
there for thousands of years, but [if we return there now, with the
powerful new technologies of the **21st century**, [our species
will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably **[[annihilate
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Of course, even if we disappear, it will not be the end of the world.
Something will survive us. Perhaps the rats will eventually take over
and rebuild civilisation. Perhaps, then, the rats will learn from our
mistakes.

The [[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion has [gained]{.mark} a [reputation
for being the **strongest proponent and defender** of the liberal global
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is [[**widely presumed** that the EU
defends liberal order almost reflexively]{.underline},]{.mark} **[[as
part of its core identity]{.underline}]{.mark}** and beyond rationalised
cost-benefit calculation. This ostensibly [[involves]{.mark} firm
[support]{.mark} [for multilateral institutions]{.mark} and
norms]{.underline}; [[open markets]{.mark} and [trade
liberalisation]{.mark}; [cooperative]{.mark} approaches to
[security]{.mark}; and [human rights and democratic

liberal global order]{.mark}, **the [EU's commitment to these norms is

areas of policy, however, the EU's record in defending the liberal order
looks increasingly mixed. Compared to the other actors covered in this
special issue, the EU's trade, foreign and security policies are indeed
relatively strongly imbued with liberal principles. Yet, in recent years
the EU's own approaches to global order and international challenges
have adopted a more selective or contingent liberalism.

[The [2016 EU Global Strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} (EUGS1) [[contains
standard commitments to "rules-based order"]{.underline}]{.mark} but
also gestures towards a more flexible or "principled pragmatism" in
foreign policy. The strategy does not specify what this might mean in
practice, although it does not talk of an especially thick form of
liberal order. Instead of trying to second guess the meaning of the
Global Strategy's still largely unimplemented text, we look at actual EU
policy changes and assess how 'liberal' these are in the way they
approach concrete order-related challenges.

### No I-Law Impact\-\--2NC

### Trump\-\--2NC

#### The United States [destroys]{.underline} i-law. Not [just]{.underline} Trump but [also]{.underline} Democrats. 

**Norton 7/27** \[Ben Norton, investigative journalist and analyst and

//adiiiiG

The [Donald [Trump]{.mark} administration has [launched **many frontal
attacks** on]{.mark} multilateral organizations and [international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, these [[clear violations]{.mark} of international law [are
**nothing new**]{.mark} for US presidents]{.underline}. [Opposition to
multilateralism has been a bipartisan [feature of US politics for many
decades]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In February, Trump withdrew the United States from the UN Human Rights
Council (UNHRC), repeating an action he had done back in 2018, during
his first term.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration also [[attacked]{.mark}
the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East
([UNRWA]{.mark}]{.underline}), and announced that he [had cut US funding
for both UNRWA and the UNHRC]{.underline}.

Then, in July, [Trump withdrew the United States from
[UNESCO]{.mark}]{.underline}, the United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization.

The US State Department complained that "UNESCO's decision to admit the
'State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary
to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel
rhetoric within the organization".

During his first term, back in 2017, Trump had also withdrawn the US
from UNESCO.

In superficial contrast to Trump, the Joe Biden administration cynically
employed rhetoric about multilateralism. But it was just marketing,
because Washington still acted in an aggressive, unilateral manner.

In 2021, Biden had the US rejoin the UNHRC. His Secretary of State
Antony Blinken insisted that Washington was upholding the so-called
"rules-based international order".

In 2023, the Biden administration even rejoined UNESCO --- although this
was the same year that the US government sponsored a genocide in Gaza,
flooded Israel with \$18 billion in military aid, and
unilaterally vetoed numerous UN Security Council resolutions that called
for a ceasefire.

Democratic critics have depicted [Trump as [a **unique threat**]{.mark}
over his flagrant opposition [to international law]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The corporate media has often repeated this deceptive trope, spinning
the narrative that the US government supported multilateralism and
international law until Trump came along and blew it all up.

This is completely false, ahistorical, and absurd.

[One does not need to go back far in history to see the [**myriad
examples** of Washington blatantly attacking international
law]{.mark}.]{.underline}

George W. Bush signed the Hague Invasion Act in 2002, threatening
military intervention if the Hague ever tried US officials or their
allies. That same year, he also "unsigned" the treaty establishing the
International Criminal Court (ICC).

When the Trump White House imposed sanctions on the ICC in February
2025, it cited the Bush-era Hague Invasion Act (officially called the
American Servicemembers' Protection Act) to justify the aggressive
action.

Bush similarly withdrew from a major international treaty on climate
change in 2001. [Trump later did the same, pulling out of the Paris
Agreement, which is a legally binding international treaty under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.]{.underline}

Then, of course, [[Bush invaded Iraq]{.mark} in a criminal war of
aggression]{.underline}, which UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said
**[[clearly violated international law.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[A million Iraqis died due to this illegal imperial
war.]{.underline}**

[It is not just Republicans who wage these political wars on
international law; [Democrats **do as well**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

You know who helped establish the precedent for attacking UNESCO? Barack
Obama. He cut US funding for UNESCO in 2011, after the UN body voted to
admit Palestine.

//adiiiiG

[[Even before]{.mark} President [Trump took office]{.mark}, the global
balance of power and the [international]{.mark} political [order were
shifting]{.mark}, resulting in greater instability, uncertainty, and
insecurity.]{.underline} But [[Trump's recent
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}---such as launching a global trade tariff
war, [[siding with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in an attempt to end the
war in Ukraine, [[desiring to annex Canada and "buy"
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}---have [**[accelerated the
decline]{.underline}** [of the so-called "liberal international
order".]{.underline}]{.mark} Contrary to what many commentators believe,
this isn't necessarily a bad thing, because the concept of the "liberal
international order" is largely rooted in social liberalism, as are most
liberal theories in the field of international relations.\
\
The best-known thinker on the liberal international order is Professor
G. John Ikenberry (Princeton), who outlines that its development began
after World War I, influenced by US President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen
Points for world order. These included proposals to establish the League
of Nations (which the US ultimately did not join), calls for
transparency in treaty-making, free trade, and decolonisation. This
approach failed dismally, but was nevertheless revived in the "free and
democratic West" after World War II---again under American leadership.
The United Nations was meant to be the central international
organisation, which expanded with a host of specialised agencies like
UNRWA and UNICEF. More international organisations were established as
well, the most prominent being the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and the GATT (later Word Trade Organisation). [International
law exploded. After the Cold War, this system was extended to include
former communist countries and various previously non-aligned nations
such as India and Indonesia, making it a full global order, although
many countries and leaders only paid lip service to its ideals and
foundations.]{.underline}\
\
According to Ikenberry, the key feature of the liberal international
order is a system of sovereign states (preferably but not limited to
liberal democracies) with open, mutual relations, governed by
international law, international organisations and other agreements.
Although defence cooperation (such as NATO) is an inseparable part of
the liberal international order, the larger idea is to constrain power
politics through international organisation, not least through the
development of mutual interdependence between states. The belief is that
global trade, international negotiations, and legal obligations help
maintain peace. While there is little convincing evidence for this, as
the many wars of recent decades demonstrate, Ikenberry and his
supporters still claim that countries in the liberal international order
are united by shared values and a common goal of continuous
improvement---both materially and in pursuit of a "socially just
world".\
\
Ikenberry's view is open to criticism, as it's debatable whether this is
an accurate portrayal of international politics over the past decades,
where power politics has remained a central tenet. The idea that we are
moving towards a socially just world has always been utopian, but is
solidly attached to liberalism in world politics, often based on
erroneous interpretations of Kant's Perpetual Peace or the writings of
John Rawls. The same applies to the overly simplistic idea (also held by
some classical liberals) that trade fosters peace, with Adam Smith as
the main victim of misinterpretation.\

#### The nuclear deterrent is working now, [but]{.underline} absent American deterrence, European states [proliferate]{.underline} nukes. 

**Wright 25** \[Thomas Wright, Research Associate - German Institute for
International and Security Affairs, 6-17-2025, \"Should Europeans
develop an independent nuclear deterrent?\", Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/should-europeans-develop-an-independent-nuclear-deterrent/\]
//adiiiiG

Two external shocks have fundamentally changed the way Europeans view
nuclear deterrence. First, Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022
heightened the threat perception in Europe, thereby increasing the need
for defense and deterrence. The past three years showed that [nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} seemingly
**[[worked]{.underline}]{.mark}** in two ways: It [[protected
NATO]{.mark}---a nuclear alliance [backstopped by U.S.]{.mark} military
preeminence---because [Russia]{.mark} has [refrained from]{.mark}
military [escalation]{.mark}, but it also protected Russia because it
ensured that the United States would not get directly involved and that
transatlantic allies would carefully calibrate their support for Ukraine
out of fear of nuclear escalation.]{.underline}

The second shock came with the Trump administration. Washington has
increasingly treated Europe not as a partner but as a strategic irritant
in the most crucial areas of the transatlantic relationship. Examples
range from Vice President JD Vance's February 2025 Munich Security
Conference speech, in which he described Europeans as ideological
adversaries, to the potential U.S.-Russian reset and President Donald
Trump pressuring Ukraine to end the war on Russia's terms. In the runup
to the 2025 NATO summit, allies seek to keep the United States involved
by committing to the 5% GDP defense spending target Trump has been
calling for. While for the moment Washington seems to behave
constructively within the alliance as long as Europeans spend more,
allies worry that the United States is becoming a single-issue nation
that only focuses on spending, rather than leading strategic debates and
pursuing allied unity. The future of transatlantic trade and investment
also burdens the relationship. These events have led European
policymakers to question whether Europeans and Americans still share
similar political visions, and whether Washington is still a reliable
partner or might act against European interests.

These two shocks reinforce preexisting European concerns that the United
States might be less interested in Europe, given that it sees China as
the key challenge and that the emergence of revisionist powers requires
Washington to think beyond Europe. To address these concerns, [several
[politicians]{.mark} and pundits throughout Europe [concluded]{.mark} in
spring 2025 that the [continent]{.mark} would [be better off with
an]{.mark} [independent nuclear deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}---and
leaders from Germany, Poland, and the Baltics signaled an intention to
explore alternative solutions. For instance, during a crisis between
Washington and Kyiv in February 2025, Germany's Friedrich Merz declared
the United States no longer trustworthy and called for talks on nuclear
sharing with Paris. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk declared in March
2025 that given the profound change in American geopolitics, Europe
would be safer if it had its own nuclear arsenal.

However, the [[current]{.mark} transatlantic [arrangements]{.mark} are
[neither defunct nor]{.mark} easily [replaceable]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Also, [[developing]{.mark} a reliable, independent nuclear [deterrent
poses **much greater challenges**]{.mark} than most analysts
acknowledge]{.underline}---and there is a **[fundamental
difference]{.underline}** between rallying around one of the existing
nuclear powers (or both) in Europe (France and the United Kingdom) and
developing a common European deterrent. The first would [attempt to
build upon the existing nuclear arsenals]{.underline} of France and the
U.K., thereby [further developing the existing nuclear
order]{.underline}. The other would **[[fundamentally
transform]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [existing]{.mark} nuclear
[order]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}---by either coalescing around a
European super-state or by widely expanding the number of European
nuclear-weapon states. Therefore, Europeans need to be cautious when
defining the challenges ahead and avoid overreactions. In the short and
medium term, it is extremely unlikely that they would have to replace
the current, U.S.-led system. Rather, it is likely that they will have
to substantially complement NATO's deterrence as Washington will be more
reluctant to provide certain security components and might weaken
deterrence through dismissive political statements.

If the structural constraints and inherent dilemmas were less stark, we
would urge Europeans to adopt clear, decisive solutions that would
reduce uncertainty and strengthen the continent's security. If
Washington's assurances were invalid, the Europeans would need to
develop their own version of nuclear deterrence, and they should do so
quickly to avoid a deterrence gap. However, the need to navigate
difficult trade-offs and considerable uncertainty calls for prioritizing
the most feasible solution for the most likely scenario. Against this
background, it is better for Europeans to buy time, think through their
nuclear options, and concentrate on acquiring powerful conventional
forces. This approach, though undoubtedly incomplete and unsatisfying,
remains the most realistic and viable option for now---credible
intra-European extended deterrence seems currently unlikely and would
raise extremely difficult challenges, while a genuinely European nuclear
arsenal (in contrast to a national one) would only be meaningful within
a politically integrated continent, which is unlikely any time soon.

A strained but enduring transatlantic relationship

Both in public and private, Trump and his key political appointees have
clearly stated that Europe is not a priority, expressed disdain for
Europe's political order, and raised doubts about their commitment to
the continent's security. However, **[members of the [Trump]{.mark}
administration have repeatedly [signaled]{.mark} to the Europeans
[that]{.mark} the nuclear [dimension remains unaffected by]{.mark} other
transatlantic [quarrels]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact, [the
administration has [offered **numerous assurances**]{.mark} **that** the
U.S. nuclear umbrella would remain in place for the long
term.]{.underline} The U.S. Department of Defense's Interim National
Defense Strategic Guidance, which was leaked to the press in March,
stated that the United States would continue to support Europe with
nuclear deterrence of Russia, even if Washington would count on the
Europeans to take on various other conventional roles.

The administration's conventional force posture also offers some reason
for cautious optimism. For many allies, the credibility of extended
nuclear deterrence is tied to the presence of substantial U.S.
conventional forces in Europe. The U.S. Department of Defense has
signaled an intention to reassess the U.S. presence on the continent,
and the posture review is still underway. And it is possible that
decisions to reduce the U.S. presence in Europe might be only taken
after the NATO summit, once all key positions in the Pentagon have been
staffed and the posture review has been concluded. Then again,
indications are that the Trump administration will reduce some presence,
such as the additional troops deployed after 2022, but not fundamentally
alter its conventional footprint in Europe---which can be read as an
indicator of U.S. willingness to continue to provide extended
deterrence. While the alliance is increasingly transferring
responsibility to Europe---clearly posing difficult adaptation
challenges---the core U.S.-led military structure appears largely
intact.

Of course, a Russian war of aggression with a clear nuclear dimension on
NATO's border is a fundamentally new phenomenon, and some European
allies fear that, combined with the new U.S. administration's disruptive
goals, these new circumstances might fundamentally alter the
transatlantic alliance. However, the **[[current situation]{.mark} is
actually [comparable to earlier]{.mark} transatlantic [disagreements
that did not]{.mark} result in the [collapse]{.mark} of extended nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Severe economic disputes have often
occurred throughout the past eight decades. Political disputes were
common; several allies were autocracies for extended
periods.]{.underline} Capitals on both sides of the Atlantic repeatedly
colluded with Moscow, much to their allies' dismay.

Lastly, most Europeans believe that, even under the most restrictive
interpretation of Trump's interests, [[abandoning]{.mark} extended
nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} toward the continent would be [inconsistent
with]{.mark} achieving the [president's goals,]{.mark} including
maintaining a sufficiently stable international economic order for the
administration to achieve its domestic aims.]{.underline} It is
undeniable that Trump and many of his associates aim to fundamentally
reshape the international system. However, they do not appear entirely
indifferent to domestic constraints. This assessment is supported by the
administration's retreat from its maximalist positions when confronted
with substantial economic costs. Also, the Trump administration's
current approach to NATO seems to suggest that the U.S. government
remains committed to its security assurances and recognizes the
strategic importance of allies. While U.S. officials may believe that
limited conventional crises in Europe could be regional
responsibilities, massive realignments and the chaos associated with the
collapse of nuclear deterrence can hardly be in the interest of any U.S.
administration. Moreover, Washington appears determined to limit
Beijing's economic and military options. A stable, cooperative Europe is
essential to achieving this goal, while a collapsing transatlantic
relationship could severely limit U.S. options.

Limited scope for European alternatives

Amidst this backdrop of uncertainty, Europeans turned to the two nuclear
powers on the continent, France and the United Kingdom, to consider a
European nuclear deterrent with reduced or nonexistent American
involvement. Paris has long maintained an autonomous nuclear weapons
program, deploying approximately 300 warheads, primarily on strategic
nuclear submarines, complemented by an air-based component designed
mainly for strategic signaling. France has kept its nuclear arsenal
outside NATO's command structures and does not participate in the
alliance's Nuclear Planning Group. Conversely, London has maintained
much closer cooperation with Washington and remains dependent on the
United States for the supply of its submarine-launched ballistic
missiles. The U.K.'s nuclear forces are committed to NATO's mission,
though operational control remains under British authority.

In recent months, European hopes have increasingly centered on Paris. On
the one hand, both the U.K. and France have maintained limited
countervalue nuclear arsenals designed to provide credible deterrence
against threats to their core national interests, but they are not
intended to serve an extended deterrence role. On the other hand, France
has for decades declared that its vital interests include a European
dimension, and since 2020 has repeatedly invited European partners to
explore what greater role it might play in European deterrence. Most
recently, President Emmanuel Macron proposed a debate about extending
France's nuclear deterrent to protect European allies. The U.K. has
stayed in the background. However, London's 2025 Strategic Defence
Review briefly alludes to nuclear deterrence, and assessments are being
conducted regarding the U.K.'s potential redevelopment of an air-based
component and reconversion into a nation with dual-capable aircraft to
demonstrate commitment.

Even with these aspirations, historical precedent and strategic logic
offer little reason to believe that the U.K. or, particularly, France,
which has been more active in the debate, absent a counterforce posture
and damage-limitation capacity, could credibly replace the United States
as a provider of extended nuclear deterrence. Whereas Washington can
argue that it possesses the overwhelming conventional forces and large
and diverse nuclear capabilities to defend its allies in an all-out
nuclear war without necessarily completely sacrificing its own homeland,
Paris would face the far more difficult task of convincing its European
partners that it is willing to risk its own complete annihilation on
their behalf. Moreover, Paris' allies would need to accept that mutual
assured destruction between Russia and France would place any limited
nuclear conflict squarely on the territories of the states in
between---without those states having any ultimate say over decisions
made by French leaders.

Most French officials appear keenly aware of these constraints. Thus,
none of the proposals emerging from Paris in recent years suggest
anything close to a substitution role for France; rather, they reflect a
much more complementary understanding of French nuclear options. French
officials repeatedly emphasized that their goal was not to replace
Washington's role, but rather to develop a new deterrence approach for
Europe together with their European partners, especially in light of the
United States' increased focus on Asia and on nuclear revisionist
powers. However, so far, most French experts have made suggestions that
seem to operate within the current framework of U.S. extended
deterrence. Some proposed, for example, that European allies participate
in French nuclear exercises. The more ambitious French proposals
envision European allies refurbishing air bases to accommodate French
nuclear bombers. That said, French officials frequently emphasize that
Paris is not seeking to bolster its nuclear deterrent, but merely to
demonstrate "strategic solidarity."

At the declaratory level, Paris and London could Europeanize their
bilateral declaration that neither could envision a scenario where its
vital interests would be threatened without the other's also being at
risk, thereby enlarging the scope of potential nuclear protection.
Nonetheless, both Macron and various French officials have explicitly
stated that they do not contemplate any arrangement involving shared
authority over nuclear employment, nor do they anticipate a substantial
enlargement of the French nuclear force.

In addition, France's past behavior, current interests, and likely
domestic political constraints suggest that Paris will not dramatically
expand its military capabilities in Europe in the near future. For many
allies, Paris has for decades followed a largely national-centered
agenda, making few concessions to collective European interests despite
regularly calling for European sovereignty. Also, domestic political
uncertainty in France casts doubt on whether pro-European forces will
remain in power in Paris in the future. This, however, also applies the
other way around: France is concerned about engaging in nuclear
cooperation with allies that could soon be governed by Eurosceptic or
extremist governments. 

Going it alone is not a good idea

Considering the difficulties of extended nuclear deterrence, many
European commentators and decisionmakers instinctively regard the
acquisition of nuclear weapons as the most viable path forward. It is
thus not surprising that, in March 2025, the Polish prime minister
suggested to his country's parliament that Warsaw should keep its
options open. Most European nations possess the technical expertise and
physical resources necessary to develop their own nuclear arsenals.
However, embarking on such an undertaking would involve significant
costs and considerable time. While some of the world's most advanced
industrial nations would most certainly be able to replicate
technologies that are eight decades old, obtaining fissile materials,
building reliable warheads, and developing effective delivery systems
pose highly complex challenges.

[And [nuclear proliferation is anything but
risk]{.mark}-]{.underline}free. If Europeans misinterpret U.S.
commitments while Washington remains dedicated to preserving its order,
it is likely to take steps to stop its allies. Past experience suggests
that the United States can mobilize substantial diplomatic, economic,
and political resources to exert pressure on both friends and
adversaries to prevent nuclear proliferation. Conversely, if Washington
were to fully abandon its commitment to protecting its allies,
**[[Moscow]{.mark} would likely [see few reasons to refrain from using
all force]{.mark} at its disposal to prevent
proliferation]{.underline}**. Considering that key nuclear facilities
are comparatively easy to identify and strike, and that [[Russia]{.mark}
will continue to [hold]{.mark} an [escalation edge through]{.mark} its
strategic, tactical, and long-range capabilities, [Europe]{.mark}an
nations will likely [face **serious challenges**]{.mark} in any
counterproliferation scenario.]{.underline}

The [[unintended consequences]{.mark} of a broadly proliferated
landscape are even more [significan]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark}.
Should the principal European nations choose to develop nuclear
arsenals, [numerous [secondary powers]{.mark} would likely
[pursue]{.mark} the [same path,]{.mark} [culminating in]{.mark} a
precarious, [nuclear-armed Europe]{.mark} marked by volatile internal
and external relations.]{.underline} While these nations might feel more
secure vis-à-vis Russia, many would [simultaneously [fear]{.mark} both
[deliberate and accidental escalation]{.mark},]{.underline} and [[harbor
deep suspicions]{.mark} about their neighbors'
intentions]{.underline}---[especially in]{.underline} an environment
characterized by [political [polarization]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
growing influence of [extremist forces]{.mark} across
Europe]{.underline}. The [[pursuit of greater security]{.mark} would
[paradoxically result in a less secure overall
environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Centralized power remains an illusion

Both the pursuit of French extended nuclear deterrence and the path of
unilateral proliferation confront severe technical challenges, many of
which a centrally coordinated United States of Europe would be far
better positioned to address or avoid altogether. By vesting the leader
of its central government with control over a unified Franco-British
nuclear arsenal, such a state could adopt a limited nuclear deterrence
posture which, when combined with significant conventional capabilities
and weaker transatlantic ties, might plausibly succeed in reassuring
those citizens living closer to Russia's border that deterring nuclear
coercion remained credible. Ultimately, this central government's very
legitimacy would rest on its ability to defend the entire territory of
the new state, thereby granting its leadership the necessary credibility
to sustain such a deterrence posture.

However, the degree of centralization required for such a United States
of Europe would demand a level of integration that most European nations
regard as illusory within the coming decades. Currently, political,
economic, and security goals vary so fundamentally across
Europe---shaped by historical legacies, divergent threat perceptions,
and competing national priorities---that no polity appears willing to
shoulder the political sacrifices or financial burdens required to
achieve lasting agreement on shared positions. While Europe's unity on
trade matters often impresses observers across the Atlantic, it is
important to note that the continent has struggled to share the costs of
averting economic recessions, has yet to implement meaningful decisions
to collectively shoulder even moderate portions of the burden of
rearmament, and includes states like Austria and Ireland, who are firmly
opposed to nuclear deterrence.

Conclusion

Although the idea of acquiring an independent nuclear deterrent may
appear intuitive to many Europeans, in reality, the available pathways
are either unattainable or burdened with overwhelming technical,
political, and strategic challenges. The option that holds greater
promise from a technical perspective---deeper European
integration---remains a distant prospect. Regrettably, strategies aiming
to achieve nuclear deterrence by relying on Paris, developing national
arsenals, or adopting minimal integration are either inherently
unworkable, linked with enormous challenges, or risk producing profound
negative externalities. Although these strategies may appear to provide
simple and practical fixes, they ultimately cultivate dangerous
illusions among the actors involved, leading to unrealistic
expectations. Moreover, while the Trump administration introduces
significant and unsettling uncertainties, it remains likely that
extended deterrence will endure through the president's four-year term
in office---an assessment that numerous German and other European
officials seem to share, despite the alarm politicians expressed at the
beginning of the year and the rather excitable expert debate that
followed it.

Therefore, Europeans should bide their time and focus on enhancing their
conventional forces. Four points stand out. First, while addressing the
Trump administration's demands will be challenging, Europeans should
nonetheless strive to keep Washington engaged in European affairs. The
planned increases in defense spending and the growing contributions to
NATO's defense planning are part of this strategy. Second, Europeans
should dedicate resources to building the capabilities necessary for
both preventing Russian aggression and ensuring that any escalation
under the nuclear threshold leads to unacceptable costs for Russia.
Third, Europeans should consider strengthening the nuclear deterrent
role of France and the U.K.---not as a substitute for U.S. capabilities,
but as a strengthened complementary pillar of collective defense.
Lastly, Europeans should promote robust nuclear dialogue across the
continent to explore worst-case scenarios. This includes adapting
current nuclear doctrines, expanding existing technological
competencies, and assessing the paths to acquiring additional nuclear
capabilities.

Despite their efforts, Europeans may one day find themselves in a
situation where the United States is no longer willing to provide
nuclear deterrence. Therefore, the biggest challenge today is shaping
current developments so that Europe does not fall into a "deterrence
gap" as a result of U.S. repositioning. The key question is how to
maintain the United States' role in European deterrence and defense
while developing alternatives---without giving Washington the impression
that it is no longer needed. Ultimately, however, Europeans must
recognize that any change in the nuclear order will imply insecurity for
allies and enemies alike and that any **[[new]{.mark} European [regional
model]{.mark} is likely to [offer less stability than]{.mark} the
[current one]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

//adiiiiG

[Since the beginning of Donald Trump's second term as president of the
United States]{.underline}, transatlantic [relations have
deterio­rated]{.underline} markedly. Against this backdrop, some
[[European leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} have expressed [[doubt]{.mark}s
about [US extended nuclear deter­rence]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that is,
about Washington's will­ingness to use American nuclear weapons in a
crisis to defend its allies in Europe. Others have maintained that [the
[role]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [play]{.mark}s in
nuclear deterrence [remains **uncontested**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, a grow­ing number of analysts are arguing that Europe must
develop its own nuclear deter­rence capability. Most observers look to
France (some to the United Kingdom as well) when pondering how to fill
this per­ceived gap. The debate centres on which security needs Paris
(and London) could cur­rently meet and what additional
political commitments, military capabilities and
insti­tutional frameworks would be required to ensure credible deterrence
against Russia.

A binary view -- according to which US protection is either beyond doubt
or with­drawn entirely -- is unhelpful in this con­text. Rather, it is
necessary to examine the assumptions and consequences associated with
the various degrees of European con­fidence in US security guarantees. In
each case, the fundamental link between con­ventional and nuclear
deterrence must be considered. The interplay between different levels of
trust and the available military op­tions generates a complex set of
contingencies and a broad spectrum of potential re­sponses. Below, three
scenarios are outlined: a crisis of trust, a breach of trust and the
perception of a full US withdrawal from Europe.

Scenario 1: Crisis of trust

In this scenario, European states would continue to assume that
Washington's security guarantees remain valid in most circumstances.
[[Abandoning]{.mark} extended nu­clear [deterrence]{.mark} would be [seen
as **running**]{.mark} [**counter to the core interests** of]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline}. For its part,
[[Washington]{.mark} has]{.underline} [[long viewed]{.mark} [extended
deterrence as an **important instrument** for reducing]{.mark} the [risk
of]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[preventing]{.mark}
[hostile]{.mark} [power]{.mark} [projection]{.mark} in strategically
important regions and ensuring the stability needed to main­tain
political and economic relations at the global level]{.underline}. [This
[view]{.mark} appears to]{.underline} [[remain **intact** under the
**second Trump**]{.mark} **administration**.]{.underline} [Moreover,
[countering]{.mark} the rise of [China]{.mark} continues to be a
[key]{.mark} strategic [priority of]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}
government.]{.underline} [[If Trump were to aban­don]{.mark} extended
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Europe's]{.mark} [willing­ness
to]{.mark} support US efforts to [contain the People's Republic]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} likely [wane]{.mark} -- a development that would not go

nonproliferation regime will surely [[lead to more states seeking
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. The examples of
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and **[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}** illustrate. the [[danger]{.mark}
posed by WMDs [proliferating to aggressive]{.mark}, unstable [states and
terrorist organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The [current nuclear nonproliferation regime under the Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT) will have to contend with an increasing number of
challenges in the coming years]{.underline}. Many members of the
international community question the commitment of nuclear weapon states
to disarmament, which has led to the creation of the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons(TPNW) \[1\] . The TPNW has been
criticized by the United States as divisive to the broader
nonproliferation regime \[2\]. While the TPNW is a sign of an effort to
speed up the process of abolishing nuclear weapons, rational deterrence
theory suggests that, today's international security landscape, in part,
depends on the presence of nuclear weapons for stability. Well known
nuclear scholars such as Matthew Kroenig posit that, at least for the
moment, **[the [world is a safer place with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [retaining its vast nuclear
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[3\]. In essence, the slow steps
taken by nuclear weapons states towards disarmament, hinders their
ability to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. As this process
continues, it is possible that more states abandon the prospect of
nuclear arms reduction and seek to acquire WMDs themselves. Amidst the
uncertain future of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, [[new]{.mark}
potential nuclear [weapons states are emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[North Korea has spent most of its recent history first acquiring
nuclear weapons and then building up its nuclear arsenal and delivery
systems]{.underline}. Likewise, [Iran has sought a nuclear arsenal to
contend with its regional rival Israel and the United
States]{.underline}. Part of the difficulty in dealing with rogue states
is that each will require a different diplomatic approach. While a
proponent of deterrence might argue that mutually assured destruction
will ensure global stability, North Korea's nuclear capabilities coupled
with its belligerent rhetoric towards its neighbors, such as South Korea
and Japan, as well as the United States, is nevertheless concerning. In
addition, the anti-U.S. and anti-Israeli contingent in Iran that
characterizes much of its foreign policy underscores why the potential
for them to acquire nuclear weapons should be particularly concerning
\[4\]. The role of nuclear weapons as a coercive tool suggests that
there is a wide array of aggressive behaviors for which both states can
use nuclear weapons without even launching them \[5\]. Additionally,
rogue states, particularly North Korea, that are seemingly on the brink
of collapse could fall victim to the 'use them or lose them' logic.
According to this logic, the North Korean leader may feel compelled to
use his arsenal if his demise is in sight.

In addition to being problematic and destabilizing states, [[Iran and
North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} are both on the United States list of
[[state sponsors of terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} \[6\]. Another
prominent member of that list, [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, has
[[used]{.mark} chemical [weapons against its own population]{.mark} in a
civil war]{.underline}, which involves the terrorist group ISIS \[7\].
**[[Links between WMDs and terrorism pose a significant
danger]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because [most [terrorist groups do
not]{.mark} [have]{.mark} a [clear territory]{.mark} where a counter
nuclear strike could occur, which calls into question whether deterrence
would hold]{.underline}. Terrorist actors and rogue states that [[do not
have]{.mark} civilian [control]{.mark} over their military [and have
less sophisticated command and control systems]{.mark} are [more likely
to fall victim to nuclear accidents]{.mark}]{.underline} \[8\]. Each of
these situations will require a unique diplomatic strategy to address
the danger of proliferation. What we know for certain is that the spread
of WMDs to unpredictable states such as Iran, North Korea, and Syria is
a threat to the international security landscape, to the national
security of the United States and its allies, and an impediment to the
end-goal of disarmament. Until the nuclear nonproliferation regime can
more effectively wed the concepts of deterrence providing temporary
stability and a viable path to nuclear zero, [[nuclear cooperation
will]{.mark} continue to [fracture]{.mark}, [leading **more** states to
seek nuclear weapons]{.mark} programs.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--1AR

**Zedillo 25** \[Ernesto Zedillo, Former President of Mexico and a
renowned economist;5-7-2025, \"Nuclear weapons pose a terrible danger to
us all\", The Elders,
https://theelders.org/news/nuclear-weapons-pose-terrible-danger-us-all\]
//adiiiiG

The Elders have long been advocates for nuclear disarmament and
minimising the risks these weapons pose for humanity at large. This
year, as we approach the 80th anniversary of the infamous bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the need to raise awareness of nuclear weapons
as an existential threat to humanity is more acute than ever. That
[[risk]{.mark} is [increasing because of]{.mark} immense geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark} and volatility]{.underline}. Incredibly, [we are
witnessing a growing salience of those weapons]{.underline}, a
circumstance well illustrated by the open threats by Russia to use them
in the conflict triggered by its unlawful and inhumane invasion of
Ukraine.   

Eighty years after they were first used, the bottom line remains simple:
[[nuclear weapons pose a terrible danger]{.mark} to us all]{.underline}.
As long as they remain in existence, it is highly likely that they will
eventually be used -- if not by design, then by mistake or
miscalculation. **[The [more]{.mark} [countries that possess these
weapons]{.mark}, the [more these dangers
increase]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Nuclear [warheads]{.mark} today [are much larger than the bombs]{.mark}
that were dropped [in 1945]{.mark}]{.underline} -- even **[[a single
nuclear weapon can cause]{.mark} [unimaginable
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [nuclear [war would be the **end

Yet even in the face of this danger, nuclear states continue to expand
and modernise their arsenals, reaffirming their role within their
security planning. [As [nuclear powers compete for supremacy]{.mark}, a
[new arms race]{.mark} is [underway]{.mark} and this time, it's

[U.S. President Donald [Trump's recent]{.mark} foreign-policy
[moves]{.mark} have **[alienated]{.mark}** the country's **[traditional
allies]{.mark}** in Europe while stirring glee in Moscow]{.underline}.
While it's a catastrophic development for Ukrainian security and
democracy, this paradigmatic shift portends much larger risks for global
security. The most pressing is the threat of rampant nuclear
proliferation that the Trump administration's actions will elicit.

While on the surface it might seem as though a warmer relationship
between two of the world's largest nuclear powers could reduce the risk
of nuclear war, the opposite is true. [We are [on]{.mark} the
[**precipice** of]{.mark} a global [turn toward **nuclear
instability**]{.mark}, in which [many countries]{.mark} will be newly
[incentivized to]{.mark} [build]{.mark} their [own arsenals]{.mark},
[increasing]{.mark} the [risk of nuclear use]{.mark}, [terrorist
subversion]{.mark}, [and accidental launch]{.mark}. Countries like
[South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia]{.mark} [are]{.mark} all
so-called [nuclear latent]{.mark} states that could **potentially build
nuc**lear weapon**s** quickly---[as are Germany, Belgium, Italy,
Spain]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [Netherlands]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[FOR]{.mark} THE LAST [EIGHT DECADES]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [served as a security guarantor]{.mark} to many
countries in both Europe and Asia.]{.underline} [[Trump
insists]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Washington]{.mark} has
[received]{.mark} the **[short end of the stick]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from these arrangements, [since it was the U.S. nuclear arsenal that
served as the ultimate deterrent in defense of the United States'
allies.]{.underline} [The [massive upside]{.mark}]{.underline} of U.S.
security guarantees, however, including for Americans, [[has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} the [astonishing [containment of]{.mark}
**nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration** elsewhere]{.underline}.

[Only nine countries]{.underline} around the world [have nuclear weapons
today]{.underline}: the United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France,
China, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea. (South Africa gave up
its nuclear weapons and then signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
in 1991.) Today, 190 countries are parties to the treaty, which went
into effect in 1970. The only non-signatory states are India, Israel,
Pakistan, and South Sudan. (North Korea withdrew from the treaty in 2003
to pursue its nuclear weapons program.)

[Many [countries signed]{.mark} the [NPT because]{.mark} of
[U.S.]{.mark} assurances about their security---what is commonly known
as the **[nuclear umbrella]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
countries [include **NATO**]{.underline} members in Europe (such as
Germany, Italy, and Belgium), [along with other U.S. allies like
**Japan** and **South Korea**]{.underline}. When Ukraine, Kazakhstan,
and Belarus inherited a large number of nuclear weapons and delivery
systems in the early 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed, [U.S.
security assurances helped [convince]{.mark} them to [give up their
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The confinement of this deadly technology to relatively few countries
has been a massive boon to global security and allowed for much greater
prosperity. Without U.S. security assurances, the world might have been
far more insecure, with several additional nuclear weapons states across
Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Nuclear safety and inadvertent
escalation concerns about the possession of nuclear weapons mean that we
might even have seen potential nuclear use---deliberate or
accidental---which would have had catastrophic consequences.

[[U.S. security guarantees]{.mark}, long perceived as highly credible,
[have been]{.mark} a [**pillar** of]{.mark} the **[global
nonprolif]{.mark}**eration regime [that]{.mark} has [reduced]{.mark} the
[likelihood of nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark} and nuclear
accidents]{.underline}, and allowed countries to devote resources to
other purposes---including economic prosperity.

[The [credibility]{.mark} of the U.S. nuclear umbrella has now been
[**shattered** **by Trump**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why would NATO allies
in Europe---recent targets of intense criticism by the Trump
administration---believe that the United States would stand by them in
the case of a nuclear threat from Russia?

[Among U.S. allies threatened by China or North Korea's nuclear weapons,
Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea are undoubtedly asking themselves this
same question]{.underline}. The broader concern here is that even
[[if]{.mark} just [**one** of]{.mark} these [European or East Asian
allies]{.mark} [decides to]{.mark} secure themselves by
[build]{.mark}ing their [own nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}, [there
might be]{.mark} a **[domino effect]{.mark}** leading to several more
nuclear states]{.underline}. This would sound the death knell of the
nuclear nonproliferation regime.

There may be [**[higher risks]{.mark}** of nuclear proliferation **[in
Asia]{.mark}** than in Europe]{.underline} because both France and the
U.K. have nuclear arsenals that could provide extended deterrence to
NATO. [[Even in Europe]{.mark}, however, [political conditions]{.mark}
are [concerning]{.mark}]{.underline}. The parties garnering the
second-most popular [support]{.underline} today [in [France]{.mark},
[Germany]{.mark}, and [Poland]{.mark}]{.underline} are [[all
**right-wing nationalists**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Marine Le Pen, who
could potentially become the next French president, recently said that
France should not share the country's nuclear weapons, "let alone
delegate" their use to other European countries.

There have also been [calls for Germany to recommit to civilian nuclear
research, with the aim of developing its **ability to build**
**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}. Poland is also considering its
nuclear options. The stability of the erstwhile European security
architecture that used to be upheld by the promise of U.S. nuclear
assurances is now rapidly fraying and giving way to a path of nuclear
proliferation on the continent.

Some scholars have argued that more nuclear weapons around the world
would actually enhance security. They cite the absence of nuclear use
between the United States and Soviet Union over the course of the Cold
War, inferring that because the consequences of nuclear use are so dire,
states are almost never willing to take that risk.

According to this reasoning, we don't need to fear nuclear proliferation
because that will not necessarily increase the risk of use. This school
of thought argues further that nuclear proliferation could even reduce
the incidence of conventional war since the dangers of nuclear
escalation would always lurk in the background.

Unwittingly encouraging widespread nuclear proliferation is a highly
reckless move, however. [The introduction of nuclear programs is known
to create fear, distrust, and competition---**even** among
**allies**]{.underline}. France's development of nuclear weapons in 1960
led to an acrimonious relationship with the United States that prompted
Paris to withdraw from NATO's integrated military command in 1966.
China's development of nuclear weapons in 1964 also hastened its split
from the Soviet Union in the 1960s, eventually leading to a nuclear
crisis by the end of the decade.

Security dilemmas would replace alliances. [The **[risks]{.mark}** [of
accidental launch]{.mark} [**exponentially increase** if]{.mark} [more
countries possess]{.mark} nuclear weapons. [Not every state has]{.mark}
the [resources to maintain safe]{.mark} and secure nuclear
[arsenals]{.mark}, [raising]{.mark} huge [concerns]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} command, control, and vulnerability to [terrorist
sabotage]{.mark} or theft. For example, [in Pakistan,
**terrorists**]{.mark} have [attacked]{.mark} a [nuclear]{.mark} missile
[storage facility]{.mark}, a nuclear [airbase]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} one
of the country's main nuclear weapon [assembly
site]{.mark}s]{.underline}.

Although countries that perceive themselves as thoroughly ensconced
within the U.S.-led security order might be the first to proliferate,
they most certainly would not be the last. [A range of regimes would be
**tempted** to secure their futures with nuclear weapons, and the [end
result]{.mark} would [be]{.mark} that [**everyone** is significantly
**less secure**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

the RAND Corporation in 2023, [North Korea could [increase]{.mark} its
nuclear fissile stockpile for up [to **300**]{.mark} nuclear warheads
**[by 2027]{.mark}**.]{.underline}3 North Korean leader [Kim Jong
Un]{.underline} stated in January [2024]{.underline} that [he would
"exponentially" increase the number of nuclear warheads, and revealed a
**uranium enrichment facility** in September.4]{.underline}

North Korea has diversified not only its nuclear warheads but also the
delivery means. Since North Korea's nuclear program was discovered in
the early 1990s, [[South Korea]{.mark} has been **within** the **range**
of North Korea's short- [and]{.mark} medium-range **ballistic
missiles**, including the Scud and the Rodong missiles.
**[Japan]{.mark}** also became a **potential target** of North Korea's
nuclear weapons since the mid-to-late 1990s when Rodong missiles with a
maximum range of 1,300 km were deployed for operational
use]{.underline}. North Korea has showcased various short- and
medium-range nuclear-capable missiles. These include the KN-23 (North
Korea's version of the Russian Iskander SRBM), KN-24 (North Korea's
version of the U.S. ATACMS TBM), KN-25 ("super-large" SRBM), Haeil
"Tsunami" (a nuclear-armed UUV), Hwasal "Arrow" (strategic cruise
missile), and Pulhwasal "Fire Arrow" (submarine-launched cruise
missile). [Japan is also [within]{.mark} the [range of]{.mark}
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea['s]{.mark} medium-range [ballistic and
cruise missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the Hwasong-9
(Scud-Extended Range variant) and Hwasong-12

The Eurasian Nuclear Axis

[It is not only North Korea's nuclear weapons that pose a threat to
South Korea and Japan]{.underline}. [In 1961, China and Russia each
signed **mutual defense treaties** with North Korea that provided for
military intervention]{.underline}. Russia signed the **[[North
Korea-Russia Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership [[in 2024]{.underline}]{.mark} and the two countries are
[[strengthen]{.mark}ing their [alliance through No]{.mark}rth

**support** of]{.mark} Russia's invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly
signaled its nuclear intentions in February 2023 by [[declar]{.mark}ing
its [withdrawal from]{.mark} the]{.underline} New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty ([**[New START]{.mark}**), a U.S.-Russia nuclear arms
reduction treaty]{.underline}. According to the Federation of American
Scientists (FAS), Russia possesses 5,580 nuclear warheads as of 2024.5
[[Russia **threatened**]{.mark} to use [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
as part of its invasion of Ukraine [and]{.mark} it has
**forward-[deployed]{.mark}** its own [tactical **nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}** [in Belarus]{.mark}]{.underline}.6

[Meanwhile, [China]{.mark} has begun an ambitious nuclear weapons
modernization program of its own]{.underline}. [It currently [has 600
operational]{.mark} nuclear [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} in its
stockpile which will grow to 1,000 by 2030, [and]{.underline} it [is
also [diversifying]{.mark} its nuclear [delivery
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}.7 In addition, [there remain concerns about
a **[potential]{.mark}** Chinese **[attack against Taiwan]{.mark}** that
could [involve]{.mark} the threat or [use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons,
similar to Russia's threats against Ukraine, [to deter]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} from
coming to its defense]{.underline}.8

[[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer feel the need for the
"complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," which they have
nominally supported. Instead of trying to solve the North Korean nuclear
issue, they now [[aid]{.mark} and abet [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea['s]{.mark} [illegal nuclear arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Concerningly[, China and Russia are [signaling]{.mark} their
[collective]{.mark} nuclear [strike capabilities]{.mark} [by
conducting]{.mark} [**combined bomber task force** patrols
through]{.mark} the [East Sea]{.mark} **[between South Korea and
Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These air patrols have included Chinese
Xian H-6K bombers and Russian Tu-95MS Bear bombers, which are capable of
carrying nuclear weapons.9 [The so-called [**"CRINK" axis** of
China]{.mark}, [Russia, Iran]{.mark}, [and No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea
has [emerged as]{.mark} a [**dangerous** coalition of **authoritarian
regimes**]{.mark} [unafraid of using]{.mark} [nuclear threats and
coercion]{.mark} [to achieve]{.mark} their strategic
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}.10

[The opaque command and control authority in these authoritarian regimes
[makes]{.mark} [their nuclear arsenals **more dangerous**]{.mark}
[than]{.mark} those possessed by [democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea has **[authorized]{.mark}** the [**use**

[approved]{.mark} a [**new nuclear doctrine** in]{.mark} November
[2024]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} has significantly [**lowered** the
**threshold** for nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark} by stipulating
that Russia could use nuclear weapons even in response to non-nuclear
attacks if they pose a "threat to Russian sovereignty."]{.underline}12
His invasion of Ukraine is but the latest in a long history of
unilateral military actions in which deterrence has failed to work.

[The world has therefore been transformed from one in which

Goodbye [[nuclear optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}

With the end of the Cold War in 1991, a second nuclear age dawned. The
Russian Federation inherited the nuclear stockpile of the Soviet Union.
America unilaterally and through arms control with Russia reduced the
size of its nuclear arsenal, drawing back its nuclear weapons deployed
to Asia and nearly all of its nuclear weapons deployed to Europe.

The 1990s, despite crises in South Asia and the Korean Peninsula, was a
moment of nuclear optimism. Global governance on nonproliferation and
nuclear disarmament grew stronger as the NPT was extended indefinitely
and a global Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty agreed. Between the
mid-1980s and 2000, the global stockpile of nuclear warheads fell from
70,000 to around 12,500, where it remains today.

That optimism [[is]{.mark} now [a distant memory]{.mark}. [Relations
between Russia and]{.mark} the [West are the worst]{.mark} they have
been [since the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine has been backed by overt and covert nuclear threats.
[After February 2026, when the 2010 New **START** strategic arms treaty
between the US and Russia **expires**, the two countries will be without
limits on the size of their nuclear arsenals for the first time in more
than 50 years.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[China]{.mark} is **[rapidly expanding]{.mark}** its
**[nuc]{.mark}lear [forces]{.mark}**, [aiming for]{.mark} an arsenal of
up to [1,500 warheads]{.mark}, [bringing]{.mark} it [closer to parity
with the US]{.mark} and Russia, which each possesses about 5,000
warheads]{.underline}. Arms control theorists continue to struggle to
devise a plausible pathway to an equilibrium between Russia, America and
China. A three-way arms race is likely.

The deterrence problem

In this third nuclear age, new and complex dynamics are emerging. North
Korea is no longer a nonproliferation challenge, but a nuclear
deterrence problem for the US. In April and May, India and Pakistan
engaged in the most serious military exchange since their arrival as
nuclear powers in 1998. Moreover, novel technologies, from cyber-weapons
to artificial intelligence, have increased anxieties about new pathways
to nuclear war.

In this third nuclear age, North Korea is no longer a nonproliferation
challenge, but a nuclear deterrence problem for the US.

For American allies in Europe and East Asia, these developments are
leading to greater insecurity and anxiety. [The world is more dangerous
and, with it, [the **threat** of]{.mark} conventional war between states
and an ensuing [**nuclear conflict** is **high**]{.mark}er than it has
been in decades.]{.underline} An America that was faithful to the
essential insight of the Gilpatric committee would respond to this with
reassurance. [Instead, at the Munich Security Conference in February, US
Vice President [JD Vance]{.mark} excoriated European values,
[suggest]{.mark}ing a [US]{.mark} administration that is [uninterested
in Europe's sovereignty]{.mark} -- perhaps even its survival. His speech
echoed what [Trump]{.mark} has long [stated]{.mark}: that **[America's
allies]{.mark}** have been taking Washington for a ride for decades,
[were undeserving of]{.mark} its [protection and **must 'pay their fair
share'**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[At [question]{.mark} now is [America's **commitment to**]{.mark} NATO
and the [**Article 5** collective defence clause]{.mark},
[including]{.mark} its [willingness to maintain]{.mark} the US
**[nuclear umbrella]{.mark}** under which [member states have
sheltered]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ambivalence is underscored by
[[Trump's inconsistent pronouncements]{.underline}]{.mark}. Campaigning
in the run-up to his first presidency, [[Trump suggested **South Korea**
and **Japan**]{.mark} might [need to **acquire nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**, for instance. At [other times]{.mark} he has
[termed]{.mark} the spread of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [the
'single biggest threat']{.mark} [to the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Like his predecessors, Trump appears to believe that American
adversaries such as Iran should remain non-nuclear. Yet in 2018 during
his first presidential term, Trump chose to withdraw the US from the
2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which limited Iran's nuclear
weapons programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran is now believed
to be closer than ever to developing its first nuclear weapon.

Trump contradictions

At the same time, Trump has shown an interest in deep arms reductions
with Russia and China, an objective that would become far more difficult
should American ambivalence towards its allies push them to acquire
nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Germany, Poland, South
Korea and Japan may be unlikely -- but should it take shape and impinge
upon the security interests of Moscow and Beijing, arms control and
reduction among the major powers would be nigh-on impossible.

[For America's allies, these contradictions may be beside the point.
[America]{.mark} can [no longer]{.mark} be [treated as]{.mark} the
[cornerstone of]{.mark} their [national defence]{.mark}, and [relying on
Washington]{.mark} for deterrence [may be more of a
**liability**]{.mark} [than an asset]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's
predecessor, Joe [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**failed to persuade**
allies that]{.underline}]{.mark} their experience in Trump's first term
was an aberration and that [[the US was]{.mark} fundamentally [ready to
'repair]{.mark} our [alliances]{.mark} and engage with the world once
again'.]{.underline}

Among the main drivers of the deepening spiral in East Asia is fear of
efforts to change the status quo, whether through compellence or efforts
to subvert political regimes. [For example, [Chinese leaders]{.mark}
appear [worried]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is
slowly [walking back its]{.mark} long-standing **"[three no's]{.mark}"
[policy]{.mark}** that has governed US--Taiwan relations for decades
[and instead]{.mark} is [enabling Taiwan to]{.mark} take steps toward
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, it appears
probable that [China is concerned that [America's]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological [advances could **undermine** Beijing's ability
to maintain]{.mark} a [reliable, **retaliatory nuclear force**]{.mark}.
[This]{.mark}, in part, appears to be [driving]{.mark} China's [nuclear
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zhao Citation2024, 7).

For their part, [[Washington and Taipei fear]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}
is [on course to]{.mark} attempt to [**forcibly destabilize
Taiwan**'s]{.mark} current [autonomy]{.mark}, ostensibly **[by
2027]{.mark}**, as part of broader aggressive actions by China [to
revise]{.mark} the [security paradigm]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. They tend to view China's nuclear build-up as part
of a grand plan to amass overwhelming force in and around Taiwan, backed
by strike capabilities against the United States, to force Taipei and
Washington to realize the futility of a fight and simply capitulate.
[American planners [specifically]{.mark} fear [potential Chinese nuclear
use]{.mark} in a Taiwan contingency [to keep]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [out of]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark} by hindering the

The Russia Variable

[There is [justifiable concern]{.mark} that [recent dev]{.mark}elopments
[in **Russian-No**rth **Ko**rean **relations**]{.mark} could
[enhance]{.mark} North Korea's [**WMD** and **conventional
forces**]{.mark}, **[expand provocation options]{.mark}** for
Kim]{.underline}, and embolden him to believe he has, if not a green
light from Russia, at least a flashing yellow light to act more
aggressively toward South Korea. [The Wh[ite House]{.mark} has
[revealed]{.mark} that [Pyongyang]{.mark} "is [seeking **military
assistance** from Russia]{.mark}, including [fighter aircraft]{.mark},
surface-to-air [missiles]{.mark}, [armored vehicles]{.mark}, [ballistic
missile]{.mark} production equipment or [materials]{.mark}, [and other
**advanced tech**]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}." Glenn Snyder's
stability-instability paradox asserts that when two countries each have
nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war between them greatly
decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between
them increases. [One must conclude that [**any improvement** to]{.mark}
North Korea's [conventional capabilities]{.mark} achieved through its
growing military cooperation [with Moscow **raises**]{.mark} the
[**possibility of conflict** that]{.mark} would [include]{.mark} either
the [**use** or threat]{.mark} of use [of **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.mark}. There is no separating North Korea's nuclear threat
from its conventional threat.]{.underline}

Inter-Korean Trainwreck Ahead?

Concerns are also growing about the state of inter-Korean relations
given [[Kim's recent pronouncement that]{.mark} South Korea is the "most
hostile state" to North Korea,]{.underline} that reconciliation and
reunification between the two Koreas are no longer goals, and that [[in
case of war No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [would]{.mark} seek
to]{.underline}, in Kim's own words, "[**[completely occupy]{.mark}**,
subjugate, and [reclaim the ROK and **annex** it]{.mark} as a part of
the territory of our Republic]{.underline}." A debate has ensued as to
the practical implications of this action: Does this imply that Kim is
laying the groundwork for justifying an attack on South Korea based upon
South Koreans no longer portrayed as being "fellow countrymen?" Or does
this two-state solution justify Kim simply ignoring South Korea until a
friendlier government replaces the Yoon administration in 2027? Perhaps
just as Kim had to moderate any domestic enthusiasm for a breakthrough
in U.S.-North Korea relations following his failed Hanoi gambit, growing
affinity for South Korean culture, particularly among younger North
Koreans, requires Kim to direct ideological and cultural education
efforts to avoid giving the impression that South and North Koreans are
"fellow countrymen," reminding his citizens that South Korea is their
primary foe and invariable principle enemy. Public executions and prison
camp sentences for young North Koreans with an affinity for South Korean
music, culture, clothing, and hair styles already reflect that the North
Korean regime perceives South Korea ontologically as an existential
threat: South Korea is a living model to North Koreans of what their
country might be without the Kim family's regime. [Regardless of the
motivation, the [move to]{.mark} lay aside [denucleariz]{.mark}ation [is
not]{.mark} a predictively [helpful]{.mark} event [to assess]{.mark} the
what, when, and where of [future No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean
[provocations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The China Variable

[[China remains]{.mark} an additional [important]{.mark}
variable]{.underline}. Long gone are the days of hoping that Beijing
would finally cooperate with the level of pressure necessary to bring
North Korea to the negotiating table: it will not. [China
[dismissed]{.mark} calls for pressure on [Pyongyang]{.mark} as risking
destabilization of the region with no guarantee of success. The United
States countered by warning that Chinese inaction toward North Korea
would lead to an exponentially greater destabilization risk as North
Korea's nuclear program grows.]{.underline} That day is now here,
particularly if Kim is emboldened by developments in North
Korean-Russian military cooperation. [[Expansion of No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rean [nuclear]{.mark} and missile [capabilities has]{.mark}
so far [**not** been **seen**]{.mark} by Beijing [**as a threat** to
China's interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, a war on the Korean
Peninsula that would reach the nuclear threshold quite quickly would
pose a direct threat to China's interests, even if it cannot envision
such an outcome at this point in time. [The United States should use all
diplomatic means possible to push Beijing to use its
influence]{.underline}, with both Moscow and Pyongyang, [to prevent such
a scenario from unfolding in the years ahead]{.underline}.

The late Henry Kissinger, in describing why the international community
was unable to take action to counter Hitler during the interwar period,
wisely noted, "[[Statesmen]{.mark} always [face]{.mark} the
[dilemma]{.mark} that, [when]{.mark} their [**scope for action** is
**greatest**, they have]{.mark} a [**minimum** of **knowledge**]{.mark}.
By the time they have garnered sufficient knowledge, the scope for
decisive action is likely to have vanished]{.underline}." He added, "Had
the democracies forced a showdown with Hitler early in his rule,
historians would still be arguing about whether Hitler had been a
misunderstood nationalist or a maniac bent on world domination."

Key Challenges

According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy document
titled Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Diplomacy of Japan, [[Japan's
disarmament]{.mark} and nonproliferation [diplomacy is based on]{.mark}
a position of **[active pacifism]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the mission of
Japan is to achieve a "world without nuclear weapons" for the sake of
international peace and stability by pursuing practical and concrete
measures to minimize nuclear risks. It is founded on the need to
implement measures to contribute to Japan's security environment through
disarmament, consider the inhumanity of nuclear weapons, and recognize
that nuclear disarmament is essential to the realization of human
security. It is not easy to reconcile how to guarantee the country's
security in an increasingly severe security environment and at the same
time reduce threats and promote nuclear disarmament.

**[[The Widening Gap]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between the U.S.-Japan
Alliance and China as a Challenge to Strengthening
Deterrence]{.underline}

When considering Japan's security strategy toward China, [a gap [between
Japan and China]{.mark} [needs to be addressed]{.mark} [in terms
of]{.mark} each country's [ability to mobilize]{.mark} [financial and
military resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Japan's defense spending was
roughly the same size as China's in 1998, but the gap has widened over
the years. [[In **2022**]{.mark}, [**China's** defense]{.mark} [spending
was]{.mark} more than **[six times]{.mark}** that of **[Japan]{.mark}**
and nearly half that of the United States.]{.underline} [Chinese
[military spending]{.mark} [grew by]{.mark} a [factor of 10.7]{.mark}
between 1998 and 2022, [while U.S. and Japanese]{.mark} defense spending
[only rose by]{.mark} factors of [2.9 and 1.8]{.mark},
respectively.]{.underline} Although dependent on future economic growth,
[[if]{.mark} the [current level]{.mark} is [maintained]{.mark}, [China
will spend **10 times** as much as Japan]{.mark} on defense
**[by]{.mark}** the **[2030]{.mark}**s]{.underline}. The implications of
this trend for procurement of new weapon systems suggests that [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Japan]{.mark} will [have difficulty
maintaining superiority]{.mark} over China [in]{.mark}
**[conventional]{.mark} naval** and **air [forces]{.mark}** in the
region.]{.underline}

[[Assuming]{.mark} this [power gap]{.mark}, the [emphasis]{.mark} will
[shift]{.mark}]{.underline} from conventional fighting focused on
gaining maritime and air superiority through large-scale forces,
including fighter aircraft and aircraft carriers, [[to]{.mark} a denial
strategy of **asymmetrically [hindering]{.mark}** the [opponent's
**operational capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It will be critical
in this context to establish asymmetric superiority by strengthening
cross-domain operational capabilities, combining submarine-based
underwater warfare, and investing in dominance in electronic warfare as
well as space and cyber. By doing so, Japan and the United States can
avoid giving China a "window of opportunity" to raise its expectations
of achieving strategic objectives by force.

[The 2022 U.S. National Defense Strategy]{.underline}, published in
October, [lists]{.underline} deterrence by denial, deterrence by
resilience, and deterrence by direct and collective cost imposition as
necessary elements to form the contemporary deterrence architecture (or
"[integrated deterrence]{.underline}"). It suggests the need for a
deterrence posture that mobilizes more diverse means, including economic
and information-based means, rather than the former deterrence
mechanisms centered on deterrence by punishment. Several issues need to
be addressed in the development of a deterrence posture that uses
multiple layers and diverse means. A first question is how non-strategic
deterrence can be integrated with strategic deterrence. Second, when the
integration of non-strategic and strategic deterrence is required, a
question emerges of how to define the division of roles between the
United States and its nonnuclear allies amid the nuclear, nonnuclear,
and nontraditional domains. Third, there is the question of whether it
is possible to find a formula for a sustainable and agreeable
threat-management mechanism (what used to be called strategic stability)
among China, the United States, and Japan in this complex relationship
between the strategic and nonstrategic levels.

Naturally, China would take steps to reduce the effectiveness of such a
strategy. Mutual arms escalation will also increase the risk of
accidental conflict. Arms control processes are one means of managing
such risks. [However, [China]{.mark} has [not express]{.mark}ed
[interest in]{.mark} nuclear [arms control]{.mark} with the United
States at this time. Despite having acquired a certain level of
deterrence against the United States, China is [actively looking to
**enhance**]{.mark} its **[nuclear capabilities]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
which are currently inferior to those of the United States at the
strategic level. By establishing (or making the United States recognize)
"mutual vulnerability" with the United States at the strategic level,
China aims to achieve greater flexibility in its actions at the
sub-strategic and regional levels.

Such [[strategic asymmetries]{.underline}]{.mark} and complexities [will
[make]{.mark} it even more [difficult to resolve]{.mark} the U.S.-China
security dilemma]{.underline}. In addition, [resolution of such a
situation must take into account [**Japan's security concern**
regarding]{.mark} the **[stability-instability
paradox]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is in Japan's vital interest to
envision how to manage strategic competition in terms of both an
escalation crisis and an arms race. [In particular, [given]{.mark} the
challenge of how Japan and the United States can **favorably shape**
**strategic competition** with [China]{.mark}, [which has
**more**]{.mark} [gov]{.mark}ernment discretion and [**flexibility** in
allocating resources]{.mark}, including finances,]{.underline} it is
necessary to deepen discussion about the role of arms control and
specific measures to be taken.

The Main Argument

Discussions of the issue almost always focus on Seoul's decision. Would
it make sense for the ROK to develop nuclear weapons?

The arguments against it are obvious and many---the cost, the impact on
the U.S. alliance, the potential for sanctions, possible damage to the
nuclear energy industry, the possibility of triggering a Japanese
program in response, the effect on relations with China, and the
potential North Korean response.

There is one major counterargument: [the diminishing reliability of
[Washington's promise]{.mark} to [risk American cities for
Seoul]{.mark}.]{.underline} That assurance sounded good to both sides
when [North Korea had no means to retaliate]{.underline} against U.S.
territory. [The promise [looks]{.mark} much [**less reliable**
as]{.mark} the [North develops]{.mark} that [capacity]{.mark}. There is
no reason to assume that Pyongyang won't succeed, [**especially** if
**Moscow** lends]{.mark} a [hand]{.mark}]{.underline}. And with America
arming Ukraine to kill Russian soldiers, Vladimir Putin might have done
so. Under these circumstances, would Washington live up to its promise?

Yoon has acknowledged: "[What we call **[extended deterrence]{.mark}**
was also the U.S. telling us not to worry because it will take care of
everything, but [now]{.mark}, it's **[difficult to convince]{.mark}**
our [people with]{.mark} just that]{.underline}." Solemn promises are
cheap. [Angry Ukrainians cite the assurances contained in the Budapest
Memorandum, which encouraged them to yield their Soviet-era nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Alas, there was no enforcement of any security
assurances attached to Budapest, and the Washington Declaration provides
no better guarantees. [Perhaps for this reason, [Cheong says]{.mark} the
[ROK shouldn't]{.mark} even [ask America to take]{.mark} this
[risk]{.mark}. "We **[cannot expect]{.mark}**---and should not ask---the
**[American pres]{.mark}ident** [to use]{.mark} his [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s to **defend an ally** at]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark}
sacrificing his [own people]{.mark}."]{.underline}

For the first time, [[more South Koreans **favor** developing]{.mark} a
[**nuke** than preserving U.S. troop]{.mark} presence]{.underline}. Left
out of this discussion, however, is the most important question, from
Washington's standpoint. Why should the U.S. prefer exercising extended
deterrence over the ROK to an independent South Korean deterrent? Robert
E. Kelly of Pusan National University and Min-Hyung Kim of Kyung Hee
University argue that it should not: "American opponents of South Korean
nuclearization exaggerate the policy's downsides, underappreciate its
benefits, and ignore the United States' own liberal values that call for
Washington to tolerate a democratic partner's national security choices,
even when it dislikes them."

The Burgeoning Risk to the U.S.

Of course, the U.S. typically claims the dominant role in any defense
relationship. That made sense in Korea during the 1950s, when the South
lagged behind the North. But the case for an American conventional
defense of South Korea disappeared long ago. South Korea possesses an
economy more than 50 times that of the DPRK, and a population twice as
large. The ROK has a vast technological lead and far stronger diplomatic
network. In distress, Seoul could call on most of the industrialized
world for support, while Beijing almost certainly would not support a
North Korean attack on South Korea. Nor would Russia, despite the
latter's new relationship with the DPRK.

[With an independent nuclear deterrent, [South Korea]{.mark} could
[deter Pyongyang]{.mark} from using nukes
**[offensively]{.mark}**.]{.underline} That is a far better option than
the U.S. having to do so. Defenders of the status quo respond that
America has nothing to fear, since North Korea wouldn't dare use its
nukes. [But [Pyongyang's weakness]{.mark} in a conventional contest
would [leave]{.mark} it [**little choice** but]{.mark} to
[threaten]{.mark} a [nuclear response to]{.mark} a [conventional
American attack]{.mark}. If deterrence failed, it would have no reason
not to **spread the doom**, like the Israelite warrior
Samson.]{.underline}

The burgeoning risk to America is causing U.S. analysts to question the
long-term viability of the alliance with South Korea. The Hoover
Institution's Michael Auslin has called out the importance of the
growing DPRK threat: "While few believe Kim Jong Un would launch an
unprovoked nuclear strike, most seasoned Korea watchers believe that he
would no doubt use his arsenal once it became clear he was about to lose
any war that broke out. As this risk increases, Washington will find it
increasingly difficult to avoid reassessing the country's multi-decade
alliance with South Korea. The threat to American civilians will be
magnified to grotesque proportions, simply because Washington continues
to promise to help South Korea."

How Long Can Such a Situation Last?

[**Prolif**eration may not be desirable, but it is [**better** for
Americans not]{.mark} to **[risk]{.mark}** their [**society** to defend
non-nuclear states]{.mark}. America's economic and cultural ties with
the ROK are substantial, but **not existential**]{.underline}. During
the Cold War, Washington could brandish nuclear weapons against North
Korea without consequence, since the latter could not respond in kind.
[No longer---[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea is [preparing to join]{.mark}
the small [band of nations that have]{.mark} the [ability to
**incinerate American cities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And nothing at
stake on the Korean Peninsula warrants the sacrifice of American cities
and potentially millions of Americans.

Of course, every breach of the global nonproliferation standard is
undesirable. [However, **No**rth **Ko**rea has [already **broken** its
**pledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the U.S. has encouraged, accepted,
or accommodated proliferation elsewhere. No sanctions were applied
against the United Kingdom, France, or Israel. Washington tried, but
failed, to prevent India and Pakistan from joining the nuclear club and
eventually accepted the new reality. South Korea's entry would only
reinforce past breaches.

#### North Korea's [geopolitical repositioning]{.underline} increases the [risk]{.underline} and severity of a Korean war.

This past January, Robert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, both experienced
Korea-watchers, caught many by surprise when they wrote that North
Korean leader [Kim Jong Un is preparing for war]{.underline}. That may
be an exaggeration, but the concern is not misplaced. I have worked on
the Korea nuclear problem in and out of government over the past three
decades, and [[the Korean Peninsula]{.mark} seems **[more
dangerous]{.mark}** and volatile [than]{.mark} at [any time since
1950.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Since 2019]{.underline}, there have been [three interrelated strategic
shifts]{.underline} around the North Korean nuclear problem that have
invalidated the core assumptions guiding United States and South Korean
diplomacy since 1992. First, following the failed 2019 summit in Hanoi
between Kim and former U.S. President Donald Trump, [[Kim
revealed]{.mark} a **[five-year plan]{.mark}** in 2021 [for]{.mark} a
[major nuclear and missile buildup]{.mark}, including solid-fuel ICBMs,
miniaturized warheads, tactical nuclear weapons, and hypersonic
missiles. [No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea['s]{.mark} [investment
in]{.mark} its [nuclear-industrial complex]{.mark}, along with Kim's
emphatic [statements]{.mark} that [it will **not give up**]{.mark} its
**[nukes]{.mark}** (which is [embodied in]{.mark} its [constitution
and]{.mark} preemptive [nuclear doctrine]{.mark}) [underscore]{.mark}
the [strategic shift]{.mark} in posture.]{.underline}

These new capabilities and stated intentions have changed the strategic
balance in Northeast Asia, [[posed]{.mark} **new [credibility
questions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[extended deterrence]{.mark}, and [fueled South Korea's desire]{.mark}
to [obtain]{.mark} its [own nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Then there's [Pyongyang's geopolitical repositioning]{.underline}. It
began with [[Kim **discard**]{.mark}**ing** the [long-term]{.mark} North
Korean [goal of **normalizing ties** to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, aimed at balancing major powers.]{.underline} This
[[underpinned]{.underline}]{.mark} the logic of [[**three decades**
of]{.mark} nuclear [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At the same time, [[Pyongyang bolstered ties with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which had become tense after Beijing backed
tough United Nations economic sanctions after North Korea's nuclear
tests in 2016 and 2017. Kim visited Beijing in January 2019, and Chinese
President Xi Jinping followed with an exchange visit to Pyongyang that
June. [[China]{.mark}, along with Russia, has since [**blocked**
U.S.]{.mark} efforts to impose new [**sanctions** for No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea['s ICBM tests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The geopolitical shift intensified as Russia formed its new security
partnership with North Korea after the Ukraine invasion, trading
economic and military aid for ammunition and missiles. This move made
China uncomfortable, as conveyed in private discussions with Chinese
officials and thinktank experts. They fear Russian President Vladimir
Putin is displacing Beijing's leverage and creating a situation much
like the 1950s and '60s, when Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, played the
two communist powers against each other.

The third shift is no less profound: In January, [[Kim
**abandoned**]{.mark} a [70-year-old **policy of reunification**]{.mark}
of what both North and South Korea defined as one familial nation
divided by history, and [declared South Korea as]{.mark} a **"[principal
enemy]{.mark}."**]{.underline} [He called for a [change]{.mark} to North
Korea's [constitution]{.mark}---[erasing]{.mark} a [commitment]{.mark}
to reunification---dismantled agencies that handled North-South
reconciliation, and tore down a reunification monument in Pyongyang that
his father built.]{.underline}

Recent events reinforce these changes. [For Kim, U.S. election cycles
are often fun messaging opportunities. In September, Pyongyang launched
a barrage of short-range ballistic missile tests, Kim vowed to make his
nuclear force ready for combat with the United States, and then, for
good measure, he published a rare photo of himself strolling through a
top-secret uranium enrichment plant and pledged to build more nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} But this is just a sneak preview of what we can
expect.

Why does all this matter? For now, at least, Kim has taken both
denuclearization and North-South reunification off the
table---regardless of the fact that those remain the policy goals of the
United States and South Korea, respectively.

[The [Korea problem is]{.mark} now embedded in [**zero-sum**,
**great-power competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The trend is toward
two opposing blocs in Northeast Asia: There's China, Russia, and North
Korea, and then there's the United States, South Korea, and Japan. [The
[shared **concerns** about]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [that
enabled]{.mark} China and Russia to cooperate in the [Six Party
Talks]{.mark} (involving the United States, China, Russia, Japan, South
Korea, and North Korea) **[are no more]{.mark}**. [Kim]{.mark} is now
**[emboldened]{.mark}** as never before [by]{.mark} his evolving
[nuclear]{.mark} and missile [arsenal]{.mark}, [support from Putin,
and]{.mark}, at worst, indifference from [China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But don't take my word for it. A 2023 report from the National
Intelligence Council on North Korea outlined the new risk environment.
Its judgment:

[[North Korea]{.mark} most [likely]{.mark} will continue to use its
nuclear weapons status to support coercive diplomacy, and almost
certainly will [consider]{.mark} **[increasingly risky]{.mark}**
coercive [actions as]{.mark} the quality and quantity of its nuclear and
ballistic missile [arsenal grows.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While the report assessed that [[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} will not use
nuclear weapons unless he "believes the regime is in peril," it [[hinted
at]{.mark} the specter of **[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation by
[stating]{.mark}, "He may be [willing to take **greater**]{.mark}
conventional **[military risks]{.mark}**, believing that nuclear weapons
will deter an unacceptably strong US or South Korean
response."]{.underline}

While the report said "an offensive strategy that seeks to seize
territory and achieve political dominance over the Peninsula" by force
is "less likely than the strategy of coercion," it makes an important
caveat that I suspect the council might revise in hindsight:

[An **[offensive strategy]{.mark}** would become more
**[likely]{.mark}** if Kim believed he could overmatch South Korea's
military while deterring US intervention and maintaining China's
support, or if he concluded that a domestic or international crisis
presented a last chance to accomplish revisionist goals.]{.underline}

What scenarios might result from such a strategy? One flashpoint that
could escalate is the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the maritime border
between North and South Korea. The NLL was delineated by the U.N.
Command around the time of the armistice in 1953, but it is disputed by
North Korea and is the source of long-standing grievances and episodic
military clashes. In 2010, Pyongyang fired on Yeonpyeong, one of the
five islands that the NLL defines as South Korean. The attack killed two
Republic of Korea (ROK) Marines and also sunk a South Korean ship. North
Korea also fired artillery shells near the island earlier this year.

In the same January speech where Kim called for the constitution to be
changed and declared South Korea as his "principal enemy," he also
alluded to revising NLL border claims at a future Supreme People's
Assembly (SPA) meeting: "As the southern border of our country has been
clearly drawn, the illegal 'northern limit line' and any other boundary
can never be tolerated, and if the ROK violates even 0.001 mm of our
territorial land, air and waters, it will be considered a war
provocation." Kim has scheduled an SPA meeting for Oct. 7.

The risks arising from these realities on the Korean Peninsula and the
geopolitical predicament in Northeast Asia suggest some dangerous, but
plausible scenarios. First, there is the nuclear shadow scenario
foreshadowed in the National Intelligence Council report and by South
Korean analysts:

After denouncing a US-ROK military exercise, Pyongyang begins what
appear live fire drills near two of the islands, then fires a barrage of
artillery shells at them followed by troops landing on Yeonpyeong
island. US efforts to restrain South Korea fail, and Seoul sends air and
naval forces to the area, firing on North Korean ships and lands Marines
on the island. As fighting ensues, Pyongyang fires a tactical nuclear
weapon on a nearby uninhabited island.

Would the United States or South Korea respond militarily and risk
escalation? Would China veto a U.N. Security Council resolution in the
face of the first nuclear use since Hiroshima---or work with the United
States to contain the situation[? At a time when both the United States
and South Korea **lack** reliable **diplomatic** or military
**channels** of communication with Pyongyang, it could easily **spin out
of control**.]{.underline}

[A still more [alarming scenario is]{.mark} a **[two-front war]{.mark}**
in Asia [involving]{.mark} simultaneous [Korean and Taiwan
crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an in-depth 2023 report based on
wargaming, interviews with officials, and workshops, [Markus Garlauskas,
former national intelligence officer for North Korea]{.underline},
detailed how [deterrence could fail, and the logic and dynamics that
could, for example, lead Kim to attack South Korea if China invaded
Taiwan and the United States intervened militarily, diverting focus and
resources]{.underline}. Or, conversely, the possibility of coordinated
simultaneous offensives, where both China and North Korea launch attacks
on Taiwan and South Korea.

Three nuclear weapon states in conflict (and one might speculate how
Putin would act) may sound fantastical or, as some fear, sleepwalking
toward Armageddon. While such worst-case scenarios are unlikely to occur
anytime soon, [[North Korea's]{.mark} geopolitical
[repositioning]{.mark} has [raised]{.mark} the [possibility of]{.mark} a
**[dramatic move]{.mark}** by Pyongyang [in the next **six to 18
months**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Both the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and China **[lack]{.mark}** a
sense of [**urgency** around the Korean Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Beijing, as Chinese officials tell me, sees Pyongyang's actions as the
fault of U.S. sanctions---not their problem. With conflict in Ukraine
and the Middle East raging, and zero-sum competition with China high on
the agenda, North Korea is and will likely continue to be on the back
burner. But Kim Jong Un may have something to say about that.

#### Absent [communication]{.underline} channels, misunderstandings escalate into [nuclear war]{.underline}.

**Dreazen 18** -- Former Deputy Managing Editor at Vox. Former Senior

2-8-2018; Accessed 7-23-2025)//ILake-JuY

But here's the bad news, and the reason hours of conversations with some
of the people who know North Korea best have left me feeling profoundly
unsettled: [It's easy to imagine a **[misunderstanding]{.mark}** or
accidental run-in [between]{.mark} the two skittish [countries
lead]{.mark}ing [to a **full-blown war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"I have queasy feeling that we're in 1914 stumbling towards Sarajevo,"
Sen. Angus King (I-ME) said during a Senate Armed Services Committee
hearing last September, a reference to the assassination of an Austrian
archduke that triggered the devastation of World War I. ["And what
worries me is [not]{.mark} an [instantaneous]{.mark} nuclear
[confrontation]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} an **[accidental
escalation]{.mark}** [based]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} the [rhetoric]{.mark}
that's going back and forth."]{.underline}

King continued:

[That's what worries me, is a [misinterpretation]{.mark}, a
misunderstanding, an event: a shooting down of a bomber, a strike on a
ship that leads to a countermeasure, that leads to a countermeasure, and
the end result [is that if Kim]{.mark} Jong Un **[feels]{.mark}** his
[regime is **under attack**]{.mark}, then the unthinkable
happens.]{.underline}

He then asked Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford, who
was testifying at the session, if the US and North Korea had any direct
lines of communication that could be used to defuse a tense situation
before it spirals out of control.

"We do not," Dunford replied.

And that's the most dangerous aspect of the current standoff, and the
issue that could most easily lead to a conflict whose potential human
costs are so high --- millions dead, millions more wounded, major cities
lying in ruins --- as to be almost unimaginable.

[[With no lines of communication]{.mark}, a [simple mistake
could]{.mark} ultimately [lead to all-out war]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [US]{.mark} is led by a hotheaded [president]{.mark} who **[lacks
military experience]{.mark}**, is prone to [**unpredictable** flashes of
rage]{.mark} and fury, [talks openly of destroying]{.mark}
[another]{.mark} sovereign [country]{.mark}, and [has alarmed
advisers]{.mark} with his ignorance about America's massive number of
nuclear weapons and seemingly blasé attitude toward their
use]{.underline}. (Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's comment that Trump
was a "fucking moron" came after the president told his top advisers
that he wanted a tenfold increase in the size of the US nuclear
arsenal.)

[North Korea is led by [Kim]{.mark}, a man who rarely leaves his own
country, has executed scores of relatives and high-ranking officials,
literally [starves]{.mark} his [own people]{.mark} to free up money
[for]{.mark} his country's [nuclear program]{.mark}, and
[regularly]{.mark} [uses apocalyptic language to describe]{.mark} what
he sees as a [coming war]{.mark} with the US and South
Korea.]{.underline}

Maybe next week Kim will test-fire a missile that flies too close to
Guam or Hawaii and Trump will decide enough is enough. Or maybe a US
ship will accidentally drift into North Korean waters and Kim's navy
will open fire. [With no lines of communication, a simple
[mistake]{.mark} could [set off]{.mark} a **[cascading]{.mark}** series
of [responses]{.mark} that [ultimately lead to all-out war]{.mark}. In a
situation this combustible, there are an [enormous number of
moves]{.mark} --- some intentional, some accidental --- [that could
light the match]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Prolif Solves

#### South Korean prolif initiates [arms reduction negotiations]{.underline} with North Korea and [deters attacks]{.underline} on the U.S. homeland.

**Cheong 22** -- Cheong Seong-Chang, Senior Research Fellow at the

In order to de-escalate tensions and to prevent nuclear war with North
Korea, American policy decision-makers and academics need to consider
the nuclear armament of South Korea as an option. [A [nuclear-armed
South Korea]{.mark} will be able to [**start negotiations** for]{.mark}
**nuclear [arms reduction]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the [North]{.mark}.
According to various polls conducted in 2021 and 2022, [more than 70
percent of South Koreans]{.mark} -- 74.9 percent, according to the SAND
research institute's figures released last June -- **[support]{.mark}**
the country's [**indigenous nuclearization** out of]{.mark} the [fear of
North]{.mark} Korean [nuclear bombs]{.mark}.]{.underline} That figure
may exceed 80 percent if North Korea carries out a seventh nuclear test.

While some Korean right-wing politicians demand redeployment of U.S.
tactical nuclear weapons to address the North Korean nuclear threat,
[the South Korean [public prefers developing]{.mark} their country's
[own nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} Last December, the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs conducted a survey of 1,500 South
Koreans and [**[67 percent]{.mark}** of them replied that they
[prefer]{.mark} "[indigenous nuc]{.mark}lear weapons
[development]{.mark}" to "deployment of American nuclear weapons." Only
9 percent of the respondents prefer the latter.]{.underline}

[[Some]{.mark} American experts are [concerned]{.mark} that South
Korea's nuclear weapons [development]{.mark} would lead to a
[weaken]{.mark}ed South Korea-U.S. [alliance and]{.mark} [bring South
Korea closer to China]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [scenario is not
likely]{.underline} to be realized. [According to the "Unification
consciousness survey 2022" published on September 22 by the Institute
for Peace and Unification Studies (IPUS) at Seoul National
University]{.underline}, when asked the question "Which country do you
feel the closest to?" 80.6 percent of the respondents chose the U.S.,
while 9.7 percent replied North Korea, followed by Japan (5.1 percent),
China (3.9 percent), and Russia (0.5 percent). [The **[absolute
majority]{.mark}**, which accounts for the four-fifths of the
respondents, [feel close]{.mark} ties [to]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [while]{.mark} South Koreans' [affinity for China is
very low]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to expect that South Korea's
nuclear armament will reverse these sentiments, either toward the United
States or China.

[[Rather]{.mark}, South Koreans' [confidence in]{.mark} the
[alliance]{.mark} will [collapse if]{.mark} the [U.S. exhibits]{.mark} a
[reluctance to retaliate with nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} against
North Korean nuclear attacks on the South]{.underline}. On the contrary,
[[if South Korea pursues nuclearization]{.mark}, the country can respond
to the North's nuclear attacks with its own nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} will [**free** the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [from]{.mark} the [**conundrum** of whether to]{.mark}
use nuclear weapons to [defend]{.mark} its East Asian [ally]{.mark}. In
the end, the [U.S. **homeland**]{.mark} and its citizens' lives will be
also **[free from]{.mark}** the [threat of]{.mark} North Korea's
[nuclear **bombs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Additionally, a nuclear-armed
South Korea will]{.underline} make North Korea approach using its
nuclear weapons with more prudence, [[raising]{.mark} the [threshold for
using nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To sum up, Seoul's nuclearization will benefit both South Korea and the
United States by lowering the possibility of North Korea's use of
nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and sparing the U.S. from a
nuclear war with North Korea. Nevertheless, the South Korean
administration has failed to seriously consider the option of
nuclearization, fearing the possible strong opposition and severe
sanctions imposed by Washington. It is thus recommended that the U.S.
administration suggest closed-door talks through bilateral high-level
meetings to discuss this issue for mutual benefit.

[The "South Korean nuclearization card" will]{.underline} deter North
Korea's nuclear threats; it will [[also]{.mark} [encourage China to
engage]{.mark} itself more actively in resolving North Korea-related
issues.]{.underline} Therefore, it is very irrational for South
Korea-U.S. alliance not to play with this card. [If South Korea declares
that "we have no choice but to withdraw from the NPT in case of North
Korea's seventh nuclear test,"]{.underline} the North will be more
strained since the South has the raw materials to produce more than
4,000 nuclear warheads. In this case, [[China will]{.mark} also
[pressure No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea [not to carry out]{.mark} the
[seventh]{.mark} nuclear [test]{.mark} [because China does not
want]{.mark} a worst-case scenario in which Seoul's nuclearization leads
[**Tokyo** and **Taipei** to **also develop nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[America First]{.mark} foreign

administration is [willing to throw its oldest and closest allies in the
North Atlantic under the bus, there is little reason for South Koreans
to place their continued faith in the U.S.]{.underline}

As important as [[South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} has been to an
American grand strategy, it [has [always]{.mark} been a [second-tier
ally]{.mark} and its bilateral alliance with the U.S. was never as
important as NATO or as special as the Canada-U.S.

To the horror of many South Koreans, [**Donald [Trump]{.mark}** has
**[returned]{.mark}** to the White House]{.underline}. No one, including
perhaps President Trump, knows what he ultimately hopes to achieve on
the Korean peninsula, but [[his **rhetorical war** on **NATO**
offers]{.mark} a dire [warning for]{.mark} the Republic of
[Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Trump already has indicated that he wants the ROK to contribute
more---\$10 billion annually---toward the deployment of U.S. troops in
South Korea. That request is not likely to be received warmly in
Seoul]{.underline}. To start, that would mean tearing up the agreement
South Korea reached with the Biden administration.

One doubts that there will be any karaoke rounds when Trump meets
whoever ends up as president of the ROK if Yoon Suk-Yeol is ultimately
removed from office.

Proliferation may not be desirable, but it is better for Americans not
to risk their society to defend non-nuclear states.

Concern over the Trump administration could have a more profound impact
on the alliance than just an argument over money.

Shortly after Trump's victory, South Korean political analyst Cheong
Seong-chang declared: "[The reelection of Trump is an **opportunity**
for South Korea to **create** its **own** nuclear weapons." Cheong, who
formed the ROK Forum for Nuclear Strategy, which promotes South Korea
developing its own nuclear deterrent, explained that "[**mistrust**
of]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} is **[growing]{.mark}**."]{.underline} His
argument looks more prescient after Trump's inauguration.

Mason Richey from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies made a similar
point: Interest in nuclear weapons "will be significantly affected by
how the Trump administration approaches the alliance with South Korea
and how it approaches the relationship with North Korea." [[Trump
**denigrating**]{.mark} the **[bilateral alliance]{.mark}** and
"[wanting]{.mark} to reach an **[arms control]{.mark} deal** [with
**No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea that [provides Pyongyang with
nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons status]{.mark}," Richey said, [will
increase]{.mark} the [ROK's interest in]{.mark} "[obtaining]{.mark} its
[own nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[There [long]{.mark} has [been]{.mark} a popular [majority in favor of
South Korea producing]{.mark} its [own deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
June survey found two-thirds in favor; that proportion recently reached
as high as 76 percent. Critics complain that the simple yes/​no question
ignores the issue's complexity, including the political and economic
costs of going nuclear. The share of "strategic elites," as a recent
CSIS report labeled them, who support development of nuclear weapons is
only about half as great.

Explained CSIS: "The main reason South Korea's strategic elites do not
favor nuclearization is the consequences in terms of international
condemnation, reputational costs, and sanctions, highlighting the value
that elites place on South Korea's global status in the rules-based
international order."

However, there was a notable condition. [More than half of
[those]{.mark} express[in]{.mark}g [opposition said they could
change]{.mark} their [position in response to]{.mark} the rise of
"**[abandonment]{.mark} fears** regarding the United States, [attendant
with policies]{.mark} that denigrate allies and call [for troop
withdrawals]{.mark}]{.underline}." Nine of 10 supporters of nuclear
weapons said such a development would increase their backing. [CSIS
cited belief in the alliance as the most significant factor in support
levels, warning that "the [return of]{.mark} Donald [Trump]{.mark} to
the White House [and]{.mark} a [renewal of **decoupling
rhetoric**]{.mark} or actual policies to withdraw U.S. ground troops
from the peninsula [could]{.mark} **[significantly impact]{.mark}** the
**[nuclear debate]{.mark}** in South Korea."]{.underline}

Nuclear Movement

[[Trump's election]{.underline}]{.mark} cannot help but
[[reinforce]{.mark} South Korean [fears about]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[volatility of American politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, Trump
no longer can be dismissed as an accidental president elected by the
Electoral College rather than the American people. He won the popular
vote this time, and he did so running against an administration that
prided itself on its handling of foreign policy. [With a
[Republican-controlled Congress]{.mark}, Trump will have wide latitude
in [shap]{.mark}ing [U.S. foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. And his
behavior toward Europe demonstrates that he means to make radical
changes.

South Korean interest in building an atomic bomb goes back to the 1950s.
President Park Chung-hee set the goal of developing a weapon by 1977,
but abandoned the program under strong U.S. pressure. North Korea's
program reignited ROK interest in creating a deterrent. In January 2023,
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol cited the North Korean nuclear
threat, suggesting a return of American tactical weapons, or, "if the
issue becomes more serious, we could acquire our own nuclear weapons."

U.S. policymakers have consistently reacted in horror at the prospect of
a South Korean bomb. [Yoon's office insisted that there had been no
change in South Korean policy, but his comment spurred the Biden
administration's efforts to reassure Seoul that it would indeed risk
U.S. cities to save Seoul]{.underline}. At the April 2023 Biden-Yoon
summit, Washington piled higher and deeper the arguments and proposals
promoting extended deterrence. Central to the meeting was the Washington
Declaration, reaffirming the administration's nuclear commitment to the
South. The U.S. offered more meetings and consultations, while refusing
to approve formal nuclear sharing. Then-Deputy Secretary of State Kurt
Campbell explained "that the mechanisms that we've put in place ... the
Washington Declaration and the strategic initiatives that have been
launched to underscore the added signification of American extended
deterrence, particularly in situations like Korea, I think it's given us
what we need to work with now." However, Biden insisted that only he
would be responsible for any decision to use nuclear weapons.

[Despite these efforts, a number of primarily **[conservative
politicians]{.mark}** have discussed or [**endorsed** South Korea
developing]{.mark} an [indigenous weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Burgeoning military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, with the
possibility of Russian support for North Korean nuclear and missile
programs, has raised political temperatures further. Allison Hooker, who
served on the Trump National Security Council staff, warned: "[I think
we cannot rule out the fact that South Korea continues to move, maybe
more rapidly, towards its own nuclear program."]{.underline} If a
progressive wins an election to replace Yoon, as seems likely, the
government is more likely to oppose the idea. But changes in U.S. policy
might force even the South Korean left to reconsider its position.

Why Domestic Nuclear Weapons Programs Harm Japanese and ROK Security

[[With]{.mark} the United States' turn toward [isolationism and]{.mark}
President [Trump]{.mark}'s unpredictable approach to U.S. alliances,
[nuclearization may seem]{.mark} like an [attractive]{.mark} option [for
the ROK and Japan]{.mark}. [However]{.mark}, the [development of]{.mark}
their [own nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} programs could further
destabilize the already tense regional environment. First, pursuing
nuclear weapons [could **accelerate**]{.mark} the [**deterioration**
of]{.mark} the U.S.-ROK and [U.S.-]{.mark}Japan
[alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both alliances have deep historical
roots. [Going back on their commitment]{.underline} to the United States
not to pursue nuclear weapons [would damage both countries'
**credibility** and bilateral relationships and give Trump fuel to
divest from their defense. Second, it could [launch]{.mark} a
**[regional arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Third, it would
**[erode]{.mark}** both states' [internat]{.mark}ional [reputations as
members of]{.mark} the Non-Proliferation Treaty (**[NPT]{.mark}**) and
could [prompt]{.mark} other [small non-nuclear]{.mark} weapons [states
to pursue]{.mark} nuclear [capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The U.S.-ROK alliance originated in the aftermath of the Korean War.
Initially designed to counter the threat posed by the DPRK, the alliance
has since evolved into a robust strategic partnership. The United States
sustains a presence of over 28,500 military personnel, conducts annual
joint military exercises, and sells military equipment to the ROK to
boost its defense modernization. These elements contribute to the ROK's
defense posture against both the DPRK and the PRC. The partnership also
serves as a key component of the United States' regional alliance
network that is critical in countering the PRC's aggressive actions and
projecting American power in the Indo-Pacific region. [[In 2023]{.mark},
in response to concerns from the ROK about the U.S. commitment to Korea,
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and the ROK signed]{.mark} the
[Washington Declaration]{.mark} establishing the U.S.-South Korean
Nuclear Consultative Group.]{.underline} The United States agreed to
deploy nuclear-armed submarines to the ROK periodically and include the
South Koreans in the United States' nuclear planning for the region.
[[In exchange]{.mark}, the [ROK committed to not]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}ing its [nuclear capabilities]{.mark}. [Breaking]{.mark}
this [agreement]{.mark} so quickly after its establishment would [likely
**threaten**]{.mark} the [stability of]{.mark} the [U.S.-ROK **security
partnership**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The U.S.-[Japan]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}, initially imposed on
Japan as a condition for the end of U.S. military occupation following
WWII, [has evolved into one of the core aspects of U.S. strategic
posture in East Asia. While the JSDF is a powerful military force, its
[**reliance** on U.S.]{.mark} forces [for **decades**]{.mark} has [left
it]{.mark} with key [weak]{.mark}nesses, most [notably]{.mark} its [size
and ability to conduct joint operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
[Japanese Constitution "renounces war" as a tool of the state and
thus]{.mark} significantly **[limits]{.mark}** the [**role** of]{.mark}
the [JSDF to solely defensive]{.mark} activities]{.underline}. Due to
Japan's experience in WWII and the following rise in pacifism, the
[Japanese public historically held negative views of the
JSDF]{.underline}. Public opinion has warmed in the decades since, but
the [JSDF's mission as a purely defensive force has [resulted in]{.mark}
a [lag in recruitment]{.mark} [and]{.mark} development of
[advanced]{.mark} weapons [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. The JSDF
has fewer servicemembers than its regional peers; roughly 250,000
active-duty personnel comprise the JSDF, whereas the ROK has over
500,000 active-duty personnel. [The [ground, air]{.mark}, and [maritime
services]{.mark} are [not well-integrated to conduct]{.mark} joint
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [across **multiple domains**]{.mark}. In
large part due to growing regional threats from the PRC and the DPRK,
[Japan]{.mark} has [focused]{.mark} **more [resources]{.mark}** in
recent years [on building]{.mark} up its [national defense]{.mark}
capabilities. [Pursuing]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
program could drive the United States away from the alliance,
[leav]{.mark}ing [Japan even more vulnerable than]{.mark} it was
[before]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Japan and the ROK pursuing nuclear weapons could trigger an
unpredictable arms race that would increase regional instability. [Both
the PRC and the DPRK have made significant moves to develop their
nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. In 2021, open-source imagery
intelligence in China revealed a massive nuclear modernization campaign
through the construction of hundreds of new missile silos intended for
ICBMs. The DPRK has grown increasingly aggressive in demonstrating its
nuclear capabilities and has accelerated its ballistic missile tests in
recent years; its most recent test of an ICBM was conducted just days
before the 2024 U.S. election. [The [PRC and]{.mark} the [DPRK]{.mark}
have [cited]{.mark} countering [**perceived threats** from]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as [a **key motivator** in]{.mark} their
nuclear [modernization]{.mark} efforts. Both countries would likely view
[Japan and]{.mark} the [ROK pursuing nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} as
a threat. This would [provide]{.mark} them with a [**justification**
for]{.mark} an [even more rapid expansion]{.mark} of their capabilities
[or]{.mark} other [aggressive behavior]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[If the ROK and Japan pursued nuclear weapons, they would undermine the
entire non-proliferation regime]{.underline}. It would [**weaken** the
ROK and Japan's international reputations as members of the **NPT** and
could prompt other **non-nuclear** weapons **states** to pursue nuclear
programs]{.underline}. As the only country to have experienced a nuclear
detonation on its territory, [[Japan has been]{.mark} a [staunch
advocate of]{.mark} global [nuc]{.mark}lear
[disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [**Three Non-Nuclear
Principles**]{.mark} serve as the foundation of Japan's nuclear policy
and [commit it to not possessing or manufacturing nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}, nor allowing them on Japanese territory. The [ROK made
similar commitments in]{.mark} the Joint Declaration on the
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in [1992]{.mark} and has [since
relied on]{.mark} its [non-nuclear status]{.mark} [when
condemning]{.mark} the [DPRK]{.mark}'s nuclear program]{.underline}. A
reversal of either state's nuclear policies would erode their
international legitimacy and the global nonproliferation regime. [[It
would]{.mark} also [give]{.mark} the [PRC and No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea [**rhetorical leverage** by claiming]{.mark} that the
United States, Japan, and the ROK are [escalating tensions and]{.mark}
creating [instability]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}, thus
justifying their own nuclear build-ups.

The [economic costs of pursuing a nuclear weapons program would also
likely be significant, as both [internat]{.mark}ional [agreements and
U.S. law]{.mark} could [lead to]{.mark} the imposition of
**[sanctions]{.mark}** and other restrictions]{.underline}. While it is
possible that the United States could offer some sanctions relief, this
would be far from certain, especially if nuclearization were carried out
without U.S. consultation or approval. [Even if the United States
blocked some sanctions, **[key trade partners]{.mark}** such as the PRC
and the EU would [also]{.mark} be able to **[apply significant]{.mark}**
economic **[pressure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The [sanctions levied
against Iran and]{.mark} the [DPRK]{.mark} for their nuclear programs
[decimated their economies]{.mark}. The [ROK and Japan are far more
integrated]{.mark} into the global economy and [thus]{.mark} would
[likely **suffer more**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In addition, [Japanese or South Korean [nuclearization]{.mark} could
[**jeopardize Trump's** arms control **plans** with Russia and]{.mark}
the [PRC]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would strain their bilateral
relations with the United States. Since assuming office in January,
[Trump has called for denuclearization and arms control efforts with
Russia and the PRC as a way to reduce military spending]{.underline}.
While it is unclear how viable these efforts are, [[Russia or]{.mark}
the [PRC could use Japanese or South Korean nuclear ambitions as]{.mark}
an [excuse to]{.mark} [back out]{.mark} of arms control talks with the
United States, arguing that they should not have to play by the rules if
U.S. allies are not.]{.underline} Alternatively, [Russia and China
[could use]{.mark} Japan or the ROK's [nuclear ambitions as]{.mark} a
[bargaining chip]{.mark} in arms control talks in an attempt [to **gain
concessions**]{.mark} from the United States that are favorable to their
positions]{.underline}. Either way, the [[pursuit of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} by key U.S. allies]{.underline} [[would
complicate]{.mark} any [already complex]{.mark} trilateral [arms control
efforts]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the [great powers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unrestrained Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals would not serve
Japan's or the ROK's security interests.

deterrence]{.mark}---commonly known as the nuclear umbrella---[amid
China\'s military buildup]{.mark}, a State Department official told
Newsweek]{.underline}.

Newsweek has contacted the Chinese defense and foreign ministries for
comment by email.

Why It Matters

The U.S. has committed to defending Japan through extended deterrence,
which refers to the pledge to deter and respond to nuclear and
non-nuclear threats against allies and partners, including, if
necessary, through the use of nuclear weapons. [Over 30 countries are
protected by America\'s nuclear umbrella, a recent Congressional
Research Service (CRS) report stated.]{.underline}

According to the Pentagon, [[China continues]{.mark} its [rapid nuclear
expansion]{.mark} and is estimated to possess [over 600 warheads in its
nuclear arsenal]{.mark}---making it the third largest in the world. The
Chinese military has significantly expanded its medium-range ballistic
missile fleet, which is [capable of striking Japan]{.mark} as well as
U.S. military bases located there.]{.underline}

What To Know

[[The Extended Deterrence Dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} was held from
June 5-6 at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, the U.S. State
Department and the Japanese Foreign Ministry said on Monday. The
bilateral dialogue was hosted by the U.S. Air Force Global Strike
Command.

The U.S. side was represented by officials from the State Department and
the Pentagon, while the Japanese delegation included officials from
Japan\'s foreign and defense ministries, as well as the Japanese Embassy
in Washington, D.C., according to the command.

Established in 2010, [the [**bilateral** discussion allows both
gov]{.mark}ernment[s]{.mark} [to address **strategic
deterrence**]{.mark}, [including nuclear]{.mark} and missile defense
[policy]{.mark},]{.underline} Japan\'s foreign ministry said.

\"Our tailored dialogues with allies in the Euro-Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific have become deeper and broader,\" the U.S. Air Force Global
Strike Command told Newsweek, adding that these efforts strengthen
allied understanding of U.S. nuclear deterrence posture and
capabilities.

This iteration, which was the first held under the second Trump
administration, included a visit to the U.S. Air Force Global Strike
Command\'s training facilities. Officially released photos show the
Japanese delegation taking a close look at America\'s B-52H strategic
bomber fleet.

The U.S. Air Force operates 76 B-52H bombers, according to the
Federation of American Scientists, 46 of which are capable of carrying
nuclear cruise missiles. This type of bomber was deployed to Guam---a
U.S. military hub in the western Pacific Ocean---last month.

[Since 2022, this dialogue between Washington and Tokyo has taken place
at key locations of the U.S. nuclear triad, which comprises strategic
bombers, ballistic missile submarines, and intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), the U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command
added.]{.underline}

Last year, American and Japanese officials met at Francis E. Warren Air
Force Base in Wyoming, where the Japanese delegation visited the U.S.
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) mission. The base operates
Minuteman III ICBMs on full alert around the clock.

What People Are Saying

[A U.S. State Department official told Newsweek: \"[This]{.mark}
\[**Extended Deterrence [Dialogue]{.mark}**[\] advanced]{.mark}
President [Trump\'s **determination** to pursue]{.mark} a new [golden
age for U.S.-Japan relations]{.mark} and to [further enhance U.S.

What Happens Next?

[The [U.S.]{.mark} is also [**likely** to enhance]{.mark} its [extended

[[costs]{.underline}]{.mark} of building nuclear weapons [would be

Korean government analysis estimated that it cost North Korea between
\$1.1 billion and \$3.2 billion to develop its nuclear weapons program
(Pearson and Park 2016). However, accurate estimates are difficult to
obtain given the secrecy surrounding the program, and the exact figures
for Japan would be determined by the size of the project. To provide an
approximating estimate, it is possible to estimate Japan's potential
nuclear stockpile through a comparison in American and Japanese military
expenditures. For the fiscal year of 2023, the U.S. Department of
Defense (DoD) has allocated \$773 billion, and the JSDF has allocated
approximately \$52 billion (U.S. Department of Defense 2022; Tian &

arsenal (5,428), [Japan]{.mark} would [likely]{.mark} end up
[compil]{.mark}ing [300--400]{.mark} nuclear [warheads]{.mark} in its
arsenal]{.underline} (Kristensen & Korda 2022). [If Japan were to
utilize the modernized W87-1 nuclear warheads [(\$14.8 billion per
warhead]{.mark} as of 2020) for their arsenal, it could
**[cost]{.mark}** anywhere from \$4.4 trillion to \$**[5.9
trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline} (U.S. Government Accountability Office
2020). [Even if]{.underline} Japan were to confine the [size
of]{.underline} its arsenal to that of the [DPRK]{.underline} ([20
warheads]{.underline}), it would still [cost approximately \$300
billion]{.underline} (U.S. Government Accountability Office 2020;
Kristensen & Korda 2022). To account for these costs[, [there would need
to be]{.mark} a [**significant increase** in]{.mark} Japanese [defense
spending]{.mark} [in Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}, which was already
increased from 1% to 2% by the Kishida administration in 2022 (Kajimoto
and Yamaguchi 2022).

In addition to the direct costs of building and maintaining a nuclear
weapons program, there are indirect costs associated with increased
defense spending.

This includes the opportunity cost of developing a nuclear weapons
program instead of allocating resources to sustainable nuclear energy.
[The [cost]{.mark} of establishing a nuclear weapons regime would be
[twofold]{.mark}: the [**implicit cost** of]{.mark} building [new
facilities]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [opportunity cost of]{.mark} the
[energy]{.mark}. Given that military spending directly diminishes the
spending power of the government, [spending]{.mark} a greater amount of
money [on defense]{.mark} would likely cause a **[decrease]{.mark}d
availability** of [funding for other]{.mark} important **gov**ernment
**[infra]{.mark}**structure [and **social**]{.mark} **welfare**
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. capacity lost due to the transfer to the
procurement of nuclear weapons. [Developing [nuclear energy]{.mark} has
been a [priority of Japan's]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a [long
time]{.mark}]{.underline} --- given its limited natural resources and
high energy needs. [However, [investing in nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [would divert resources]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the
development of [sustainable energy]{.mark} solutions]{.underline}. As
sustainable energy becomes an international priority to slow the effects
of climate change, [it is [important]{.mark} that [Japan continue to
devote]{.mark} resources [to]{.mark} the [nuclear energy]{.mark} sector
[to further]{.mark} the domestic and [global initiative for]{.mark}
[sustainable energy]{.mark} practice]{.underline}, and to divert these
resources to a nuclear weapons program would significantly hinder
Japan's ability to accomplish those objectives.

Therefore, [the estimated **direct** and **opportunity costs** of
proliferation are too costly for Japan given the other significant
consequences of proliferating]{.underline}. Serving as a hindrance to
other federal programming, a Japanese nuclear weapons program would
[significantly detract]{.underline} from its current nuclear energy
program and the [overall national energy supply]{.underline}.

#### [TRADE IMPLICATIONS]{.underline}.

The impact of trade sanctions can be severe, especially on countries
that rely heavily on imports as is the case with Japan. [[If]{.mark}
[Japan]{.mark} were to [pursue]{.mark} a [nuclear weapons]{.mark}
program, [it would face]{.mark} serious economic
consequences]{.underline} from its trade partners, which has the
potential to be devastating for Japan\'s economy. [[Trade
sanctions]{.mark} such as tariffs, quotas, and embargoes would lead to
increased costs for Japanese businesses, [resulting in]{.mark}
[**increased prices** for]{.mark} Japanese
[consumers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, [a decline in purchasing
power and a **[reduction]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} overall consumer
[**spending** would]{.mark} be likely, which, in turn, could cause a
**[decrease]{.mark}** in economic [**growth** and]{.mark} an
[increase]{.mark} in [unemployment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Export revenue
would decrease, and imports would be significantly more expensive --- if
accessible at all in the case of embargos. The Japanese current account
balance would deteriorate resulting in a loss of the account surplus it
has dedicated itself to maintaining for years. [[This]{.mark} would be
particularly [damag]{.mark}ing to the [Japanese econ]{.mark}omy, where
the country's account **[surplus]{.mark}** [has been a **symbol
of**]{.mark} **"[export might]{.mark}"** [and]{.mark} a "source of
[confidence]{.mark} in the safe-haven yen"]{.underline} (Kajimoto 2023).

Similarly, [Japanese [prolif]{.mark}eration would likely [jeopardize
**existing** trade **agreements**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
([[CPTPP) and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations ([[ASEAN]{.underline}]{.mark}) [are [key]{.mark} trade
partnerships for Japan [that might]{.mark} otherwise [be]{.mark}
[negatively impacted by prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. The CPTPP, a
trade agreement between 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, aims to
boost economic integration and growth. [Japan\'s
[membership]{.mark}]{.underline} in the agreement [[provides]{.mark} the
country with [access to]{.mark} a [large]{.mark} and dynamic
[market]{.mark}, and serves as a strategic tool to [**counterbalance
China**\'s influence]{.mark} in the region. [In]{.mark} November of
[2019, Japan exported]{.mark} just over **[800 million yen]{.mark}**
[worth of goods]{.mark} [to]{.mark} CPTPP [member
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} (Jaramillo 2020).

Similarly, [Japan\'s partnership with [ASEAN]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
regional intergovernmental organization, aims to strengthen economic
ties and promote peace and stability in Southeast Asia. Japan\'s
participation in the CPTPP and ASEAN has significant implications for
the country\'s economy. The agreements provide Japan with opportunities
to promote its businesses, technology, and culture in the region.
Japan\'s membership in the CPTPP, in particular, [has the potential to
stimulate economic growth and innovation by lowering tariffs,
harmonizing regulations, and [facilitat]{.mark}ing the [flow of
goods]{.mark} and services]{.underline}. The
[[CPTPP]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[eliminates]{.mark}** an estimated
[**95%** of **tariffs**]{.mark} for trade]{.underline} of goods [between
CPTPP countries, which]{.underline} contributes to [reduced business
costs]{.underline} allowing consumers to benefit from [lower
prices]{.underline}. (US-ASEAN 2021).

[[If Japan]{.mark} were to [adopt nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} [[this]{.mark} could [result in]{.mark}
their **[removal]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the treaties,
[or]{.underline} alternatively, the [treaty members might form a new
agreement without Japan]{.underline}. Thus, [Japan would no longer
benefit from lower tariffs and regulations]{.underline}. This would
increase transaction and business costs, stunting economic growth. Japan
would lose access to important regional markets and its exported goods
would become less competitive.

[The [deterioration of trade relation]{.mark}ship[s]{.mark} would also
[have]{.mark} a **[negative effect on]{.mark}** the Japanese [**energy**
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned in Chapter I Section V of
the report, Japan is heavily reliant on imported oil, particularly from
Russia, who provided 8% of Japan\'s oil imports in 2020 (U.S. Energy
Information Administration 2020). [Japan\'s [dependence on]{.mark}
imported [oil]{.mark} is primarily [due to]{.mark} a [lack of
domestic]{.mark} [natural resources]{.mark} with only a few small oil
fields in the country]{.underline}. [If Japan were to
pursue]{.underline} a [nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline}
program, [it would **[jeopardize]{.mark}** its **[relation]{.mark}ship
[with]{.mark}** key trade partners such as
**[Russia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This could cause Russia to implement
export quotas that would make it difficult for Japan to import the oil
it needs. Oil imports are critical inputs for many sectors of the
Japanese economy including transportation, industry, and agriculture.
[According to the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation
(JOGMEC), crude oil and natural gas together account for more than
**60%** of Japan\'s **primary energy consumption** (JOGMEC
2021).]{.underline} Therefore, any disruption in this import supply
chain could have serious consequences for the country\'s economic
well-being. [The [price of oil]{.mark} in Japan [would]{.mark} [sky
rocket, generating inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Worse still,
shortages of oil caused by embargoes could lead to an energy crisis.
[[Due to]{.mark} the Japanese [reliance]{.mark} on imported oil, trade
[sanctions]{.mark} and embargoes on Japan would destabilize the Japanese
energy supply and [likely cause an energy]{.mark}
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was [[exemplified by]{.mark} the
**[Arab oil embargo]{.mark}** of 1973]{.underline} --- during which Arab
countries implemented oil export restrictions on pro-Israeli
governments, causing oil prices to jump from \$2 per barrel to \$11 per
barrel (Schneider, n.d.). This [caused an economic [recession]{.mark} in
Japan]{.underline}, [[mark]{.mark}ing]{.underline} the [[end of]{.mark}
a period of rapid [growth]{.mark} in the Japanese economy]{.underline}.
[Thus, it is clear that trade [sanctions]{.mark} on oil imports to Japan
could [have disastrous effects]{.mark} on the Japanese
economy,]{.underline} and Japanese proliferation would
[likely]{.underline} cause such sanctions to [occur [due to]{.mark} the
international [backlash]{.mark} inherent [in]{.mark} **backing out** of
the **N**on-**P**roliferation **T**reaty and **[obtaining
nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### [DECREASED FDI]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [[Japanese prolif]{.mark}eration could [negatively
affect]{.mark} its investment relationships with foreign
companies]{.underline}. [Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI)
primarily occurs as capital outflows from Japan to other large
industrial nations]{.underline}. However, it is difficult to predict how
Japanese FDI outflows would be affected by proliferation. [Japanese
[FDI]{.mark} inflows are smaller than outflows, but still account for an
[important source of capital]{.mark} in Japan\'s economy]{.underline}.
According to the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), FDI inflows
to [Japan totaled ¥7.1 trillion [in 2020]{.mark} --- a
[61]{.mark}.8[%]{.mark} [increase from]{.mark} the [previous
year]{.mark}]{.underline} (JETRO 2021 (B)). [[FDI]{.mark} is an
**[essential]{.mark}** source of capital [for]{.mark} Japan\'s economic
[development]{.mark}, **[particularly]{.mark}** in the **[manufacturing
and service]{.mark}** sectors]{.underline}.

[[Companies]{.mark} worldwide may be [hesitant to invest]{.mark} in
Japan [if]{.mark} they feel that the [country]{.mark} is [becoming
**more militarized**]{.mark} and could pose a **threat** to regional or
international **security**]{.underline}. [[Decreased FDI]{.mark} would
lead to a [decline]{.mark} in Japan\'s [balance of
payments]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is the sum of the country\'s
financial account, capital account, and current account. A decline in
Japan\'s balance of payments [would likely [lead to]{.mark} a
depreciation of the yen, which would make imported goods more expensive
and lead to **[higher inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Additionally, a
decrease in foreign direct investment would limit Japan\'s access to
capital and could make it more difficult for the country to finance its
economic development. [[Japan]{.mark} would have to [rely]{.mark} more
heavily [on **domestic savings**]{.mark} to finance investment, which
could [lead to higher]{.mark} [interest rates]{.mark} [and lower
economic growth]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### \*SOUTH KOREA\*

### South Korean Prolif Bad

#### South Korean prolif mandates [sanctions]{.underline} -- that decks South Korea's [energy security]{.underline} and creates a window for North Korean [adventurism]{.underline}.

**Parkin 25** -- Undergraduate Research Fellow at the James Martin

However, [[South Korea]{.mark} would [face **heavy**]{.mark} strategic
and economic [**costs** if it]{.mark} chose to [develop a
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} costs]{.underline}
would not be bearable by the Republic alone, and [would necessitate the
**U**nited **S**tates taking on **more** of a **burden** in the
country's defense in the short term]{.underline}. Therefore the United
States should continue to oppose a South Korean bomb, as it would
neither further burden-sharing goals nor facilitate an effective China
policy.

Embarking on the journey to [[nuclear dev]{.mark}elopment would [make
South Korea's security]{.mark} conditions even [more perilous]{.mark}
and demanding. Firstly, [**mandatory sanctions** from
internat]{.mark}ional [org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark} [in response
to]{.mark} the [ROK **breaking**]{.mark} its [**NPT**
obligations]{.mark} would [have]{.mark} [harsh consequences]{.mark} for
the Republic]{.underline}. [The [Nuclear Suppliers
Group]{.mark}]{.underline}, an international organization of nuclear
materials exporters, [[prohibits]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[members from
providing materials to nations]{.mark} [that]{.mark} have
[breach]{.mark}ed]{.underline} or terminated their
[[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} with the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA). [As [**nuclear energy** provides]{.mark} roughly
[**one-third** of South Korea's]{.mark} [electricity]{.mark}, [falling
out of]{.mark} favor with nuclear materials [exporters]{.mark} would
[harm]{.mark} not just the [nation's]{.mark} budding nuclear weapons
program, but its ability to **meet** its **[energy
needs]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Additionally, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [South Korea's foremost
trading partner, has voiced and demonstrated an interest in maintaining
a status quo on the Korean Peninsula, and would [likely **levy
sanctions**]{.mark} in an attempt [to **avoid**]{.mark} the
**[escalation]{.mark}** that South Korean [nuclear development could
cause]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Given]{.mark} South Korea's relative
[economic dependence]{.mark} on China, these [sanctions]{.mark} would
prove a knife in the side of the Republic's economy, [further
**imperil**]{.mark}**ing** its **[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Despite the advanced nature of South Korean nuclear technology,
[[developing]{.underline}]{.mark} and fielding [a meaningfully deterrent
[nuclear arsenal is]{.mark} technologically and bureaucratically
[complex]{.mark}, and [takes time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A
**[window]{.mark}** would follow]{.underline} its decision to nuclearize
[in [which South Korea]{.mark} would [be]{.mark} **[politically
isolated]{.mark}** on account of that decision, [economically
weakened]{.mark} by likely sanctions from China and the Nuclear
Suppliers Group, [and not]{.mark} yet [in possession of]{.mark} a
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon. [This]{.mark} would [be]{.mark} a [situation of
extreme risk]{.mark} for the Republic [and]{.mark} could [invite **DPRK
adventurism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Ostensibly, [a [South Korean bomb]{.mark} would [be]{.mark} a [boon
for]{.mark} President [Trump's]{.mark} [burden-shifting
priorities]{.mark}, possibly allowing the United States to reduce its
role in South Korea's defense]{.underline}. However, during this window
of vulnerability, it's unlikely that South Korea would help their main
security guarantor out the door. [[Domestic support]{.mark} in the
Republic [for nuclearization drops]{.mark} to 35-40% in scenarios
[where]{.mark} [support from]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is]{.mark} [absent]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[South Korea]{.mark} simply
[wouldn't develop]{.mark} the [bomb **without U.S. protection**]{.mark}
during its window of vulnerability]{.underline}. In addition, the
considerable resources needed for a nuclear weapons capability would not
be available for other defense purposes, leaving the ROK paradoxically
less able to defend itself in exchange for a capability it would hope
never to use.

South Korea represents an important case study in this regard. [There
have been more [frequent calls]{.mark} in recent years by Americans and
South Koreans for the United States [to]{.mark} reverse decades of
practice and re[deploy]{.mark} theater [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
[to South Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}, primarily as a means of assurance
rather than to deter specific threats. [[Even if]{.mark} such a
[deployment]{.mark} would [provide greater assurance]{.mark} to South
Korea, [it could]{.mark} well [**spur responses** by No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea, as well as [China and]{.mark} possibly
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is, of course, plausible that those
adversaries would not alter their ongoing military build-up. [Yet, they
could also adopt different strategies or pursue additional capabilities
beyond those they are building today, which could have far worse
implications for US and ROK security. For instance, it is conceivable
that North Korea or China would [respond]{.mark} to US forward
deployment of theater nuclear forces [by **increasing**]{.mark} their
[own **reliance** on nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [early in a
conflict or **decreasing**]{.mark} the [**timelines** for nuclear
employment]{.mark} decisions (e.g. through a launch under attack
posture) [compared to]{.mark} their [current
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a reaction would inevitably prompt
calls for the United States and South Korea to take further steps to
restore deterrence and augment assurance. The point is that defense and
security officials need to look not only at the deterrence or assurance
effects of specific steps, such as forward deployment, but also to
consider the range of "then what" questions to assess their downstream
implications. For many years, the answer was "not much", but that is no
longer the case. Adversaries get a vote in security outcomes, too.

A more effective means of approaching the deterrence, assurance and
nonproliferation conundrum is to pursue great reliance on conventional
deterrence. [Indeed, there is broad consensus among US defense experts
that the [best way to deter]{.mark} a [nuclear conflict]{.mark} with
Russia, China or North Korea [is to **deter all conflict**]{.mark},
[which requires]{.mark} ensuring that the United States and its allies
have **effective [conventional capabilities]{.mark}** to prevent a clash
from occurring in the first place]{.underline}. Escalation from a
conventional conflict is widely considered the most likely path to a
nuclear exchange. Thus, deter the conventional conflict, and one can
deter the nuclear conflict. [Conventional deterrence is [a]{.mark}
**[more]{.mark} usable** (and therefore credible) and [effective way to
achieve]{.mark} that [goal]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Of course, [pursuing [conventional deterrence can still further]{.mark}
the regional [security spiral]{.mark} dynamic and lead to greater
instability. Notably, US-Japanese efforts to enhance their conventional
integration and missile defense capabilities have been lauded as an
important set of initiatives that strengthen regional defense
capabilities]{.underline}. However, these actions are likely interpreted
in North Korea and China as requiring some further steps on their own
part to return the capability status quo. The [point is that
[absent]{.mark} a broader [political settlement]{.mark}, this
[**action--reaction cycle** will continue]{.mark}, [regardless of
how]{.mark} the United States and its [allies pursue]{.mark} security
through [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The nations of the region need to recognize that they are part of a
multipolar nuclear vortex of potential conflict among four states with
nuclear weapons, and two states with advanced conventional capabilities
that could trigger (intentionally or otherwise) a conflict with global
dimensions. The risks of conflict in the region are as grave as they
have ever been, and concerted, reasoned and multi-faceted efforts to
manage the nuclear risks inherent in the region are required.

As long as nuclear weapons exist, there will be an inherent risk that
they will be used, and indeed multiple nations continue to rely on
nuclear deterrence as a basis for their security. [However, all leaders,
[planners]{.mark} and officials should [seek to avoid]{.mark} accepting
[unnecessary nuclear risks associated with]{.mark} [accidents and
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Defining unnecessary is,
naturally, a matter of perspective and the basis of long-running policy
debates. As states seek to project their ability to use and manage
escalation to their own benefit, there needs to be greater work invested
to understanding escalation dynamics among states in the region and time
spent avoiding the risk of uncontrolled or runaway escalation pressures.

The period ahead is thus marked by great uncertainty, and it is likely
that calls for the development of a national South Korean nuclear
program are going to intensify. Such pressures are concerning,
particularly from the point of view of the robustness of the
nonproliferation regime. Nonetheless, [potential South Korean
[nuclearization]{.mark} [faces several obstacles]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[First, [withdrawing from]{.mark} the [NPT]{.mark} and developing a
military nuclear program would carry enormous risks of fracturing the
alliance with the United States, and thus [entail **immediate**]{.mark}
major **[security costs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some South Korean
experts are convinced that the United States -- especially members of
Donald Trump's inner circle -- might ultimately show some tolerance
toward Seoul and refrain from imposing severe sanctions. [However, it is
quite [possible]{.mark} that [Washington]{.mark} [would oppose]{.mark}
such a [status change,]{.mark} including through automatic [application
of]{.mark} its domestic legislation such as the **[Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Act]{.mark}** of 1978, [which **prohibits
coop**]{.mark}eration [with proliferating states]{.mark}, and the
Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, which **[requires
sanctions]{.mark}** against proliferating entities.]{.underline} Beyond
the risk of a withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea,
[[Seoul]{.mark} would almost [certainly]{.mark} also [face
econ]{.mark}omic [and tech]{.mark}nological [repercussions]{.mark}.
[Even]{.mark} in the [best-case]{.mark} scenario -- where the United
States tacitly accepts the situation --, [many countries would impose
**sanctions**]{.mark} on South Korea. [Given]{.mark} its [deep
integration into]{.mark} the [global econ]{.mark}omy, the
[country]{.mark} would [suffer **severe**]{.mark} economic
**[consequences]{.mark}**. [Due to extensive coop]{.mark}eration with
multiple countries, including the United States, in the nuclear sector,
such a [decision]{.mark} would [have **significant**
tech]{.mark}nological **[consequences]{.mark}**, especially [regarding
**nuclear fuel** supply]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### N/!! -- Korean War

#### North Korea won't invade -- [deterrence]{.underline} characterizes Kim's actions.

**Roy 24** -- (Denny; \"North Korea is not about to start a war\"; Lowy

[Many [observers think]{.mark}]{.underline} it is likely [[No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea is [planning]{.mark}]{.underline} and preparing [[to
start a war]{.mark} this year]{.underline}. Pyongyang has indeed made
bellicose noises in the last few months. But the main trigger for the
spate of commentaries giving serious consideration to the idea of an
imminent attack by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a
11 January article in 38 North by two respected North Korea experts,
former senior US State Department official Robert L. Carlin and
Middlebury Institute of International Studies Professor Siegfried S.
Hecker. "We believe that, like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong-un has
made a strategic decision to go to war," Carlin and Hecker write.

[There's a problem]{.underline} here: Carlin and Hecker's analysis, the
foundation of the war scare, is unconvincing.

Their case rests on three points. First, the DPRK has abandoned its
previous goal of improving relations with the United States since Kim's
"traumatic loss of face" at the failed 2019 Hanoi summit meeting with US
President Donald Trump. Second, Pyongyang believes US global influence
is receding relative to the power of China and Russia. And third, the
DPRK government has recently made official statements indicating
readiness to go to war against South Korea.

Carlin and Hecker say Kim Jong-un has chosen "a military solution"
because there are "no good options left" -- but the authors don't say
what problem Kim is trying to solve, nor how an elective war would solve
it.

Alternatively, Carlin and Hecker's analysis is far better suited to a
more reasonable conclusion: that since 2019, Kim's government has
shifted its efforts, to court outside assistance in the pursuit of its
security and economic objectives away from reaching agreements with the
United States and South Korea and toward a closer partnership with the
China/Russia Bloc. That conclusion implies continued tensions on the
Korean Peninsula, but not a second Korean War.

[[Even with]{.mark} all [Pyongyang\'s bluster]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
[combined]{.mark} [might of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and South Korea]{.mark} [would **overwhelm** its
**military**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Kim gave a lengthy speech to the DPRK legislature on January in which he
elaborated about relations with South Korea. As widely reported,
[[Kim]{.mark} said the DPRK will [**no longer** work toward
**reunification**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} will henceforth
[characterise]{.mark} the [South as]{.mark} the "invariable [principal
enemy]{.mark}" rather than "consanguineous".]{.underline} [[He]{.mark}
called for **[revis]{.mark}**ing the DPRK [**constitution** to remove
verbiage]{.mark} [implying]{.mark} that [North and South are]{.mark}
parts of the [same country]{.mark} and calling South Koreans
"compatriots."]{.underline}

As [[some]{.mark} analysts have [point]{.mark}ed
[out]{.mark}]{.underline}, [re[casting]{.mark} South Koreans [as
enemies]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than cousins might [[reduce]{.mark}
the [psychological dissonance]{.mark} that would accompany]{.underline}
a [decision [to go to war]{.mark}. [For decades]{.mark} up to now,
[however]{.mark}, [Pyongyang's]{.mark} official [policy]{.mark} of
striving [for]{.mark} [reunification did **not prevent**]{.mark} the
DPRK [gov]{.mark}ernment [from]{.mark} [making **threats of mass
violence** against South Koreans]{.mark} (see, [for example,]{.mark} the
threat make Seoul a "[sea of fire]{.mark}").]{.underline}

Kim Jong-un would not be sending stocks of ammunition and missiles to
Russia if he planned to fight a war on the Peninsula in the immediate
future.

Furthermore, in the same speech, [[Kim said]{.mark} plainly that
[he]{.mark} does not plan to start a war]{.underline}. "[We [will
**never unilaterally** unleash a war if]{.mark} the [enemies do not
provoke us]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "There is no reason to opt
for war, and therefore, there is no intention of unilaterally going to
war."

[Kim [says]{.mark} the [policy change]{.mark} on reunification
[is]{.mark} a [**reaction** to]{.mark} an "[escalation" in
hostility]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the DPRK's
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [He]{.underline} specifically [[cites
South Korean discussion]{.mark} about]{.underline} the possible
"[collapse" of]{.underline} the [North Korea]{.underline}n state,
"[[remarks]{.mark} made [by]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}]{.underline}
authorities [about the 'end of our regime'",]{.underline} US-South Korea
[[joint military exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, the US policy of
nuclear-weapons-capable platforms regularly visiting South Korea, [and
enhanced [trilateral coop]{.mark}eration [between]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [South Korea and]{.mark} hated
[Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Relatedly, [**[South Korea]{.mark}** has
[announced]{.mark} it is **[building]{.mark}** a [**capability to**
pre-emptively **kill Kim**]{.mark} and other top North Korea officials.
[Pyongyang's]{.mark} seemingly [warlike behaviour is]{.mark} partly
[reactive]{.mark}.]{.underline}

We don't need to rely on Kim's word. He would not be sending stocks of
ammunition and missiles to Russia if he planned to fight a war on the
Peninsula in the immediate future.

[An even stronger reason to doubt]{.underline} the Carlin-Hecker [thesis
is]{.underline} this: [the **[combined]{.mark}** [forces]{.mark} of the
United States and South Korea [give]{.mark} them [**overwhelming**
military **superiority**]{.mark} over the DPRK [at both]{.mark} the
[conventional and nuclear levels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This year will see important elections in both the United States and
South Korea. A return of Donald Trump to the White House is possible.
Pyongyang might hope that a sharp jolt will force an overstretched
Washington to return to negotiations ready to offer concessions, such as
relief from economic sanctions, to reduce the number of global hotspots.
[Therefore, it might make sense for [Kim]{.mark} to [order]{.mark} a
[lethal military action]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a means of gaining
[political leverage]{.mark} -- [but **only**]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [he was
**confident**]{.mark} [Seoul and Washington would understand]{.mark} the
[attack]{.mark} [as **limited and isolated**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This leads to an important observation: it is likely that much of the
credibility of the Carlin-Hecker thesis rests on the widely-held but
questionable assumption that Kim's decision-making is "erratic," and
therefore need not make sense.

[[Kim needs to **deter**]{.mark} his **[enemies]{.mark}**, which
explains his military build-up and missile test]{.underline}s. [[He
fears political contamination]{.underline}]{.mark} from South Korea,
which may have pushed him to make official his de facto
non-reunification policy. [[Welcoming]{.mark} a general [war]{.mark},
however, [would not solve any]{.mark} of Kim's
[problems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### International repercussions and legal barriers [overwhelm]{.underline} public support.

Meanwhile, [any [pursuit of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [by South
Korea]{.mark} would [have severe internat]{.mark}ional, [legal]{.mark},
[and alliance repercussions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[South Korea is]{.mark} a [signatory to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) [and would [face global condemnation
and]{.mark} likely [sanctions]{.mark} for violating it. Such a move
would [erode]{.mark} global [nonprolif]{.mark}eration [norms]{.mark} and
could [trigger]{.mark} a **[domino effect]{.mark}** in the
region.]{.underline}

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, [it could [strain]{.mark} the [U.S.-ROK
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically, [Washington has opposed
allied nuclear armament, as seen in its pressure on South Korea and
Taiwan in the 1970s]{.underline}. [A [nuclear-armed South Korea]{.mark}
could be [interpreted as]{.mark} a **[loss of confidence]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} U.S. [extended deterrence]{.mark}, potentially leading to a
**[rupture]{.mark}** in **[strategic coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}.

[Third, [regional backlash]{.mark} would be [swift]{.mark}.
[China]{.mark} might respond with **[economic retal]{.mark}**iation [or
increase]{.mark}d [military deployments]{.mark}. [Japan]{.mark} could
[reassess]{.mark} its own nuclear [posture]{.mark}, possibly
[lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} a [Northeast Asian arms race]{.mark}.
[ASEAN]{.mark} [states and Australia]{.mark} might view the development
as destabilizing and **[escalate]{.mark}** their own **[defense
postures]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Domestic constraints are also significant. [[While public
opinion]{.mark} is [shifting]{.mark}, **[legal barriers]{.mark}** [such
as]{.mark} South Korea's [Atomic Energy Act]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
political resistance from civil society and [opposition parties]{.mark}
could **stall** or [derail]{.mark} any [attempt at
**nuclearization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Policy Implications and What to Watch

Even if South Korea never chooses to pursue nuclear weapons, [the
[growing support]{.mark} for such a move [is a **warning
signal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To avoid a strategic rupture, [the United
States and South Korea should **deepen** nuclear **consultation**,
increase transparency in deterrence planning, and accelerate
interoperability in missile defense and counterforce
capabilities]{.underline}.

#### Biases from older generations [inflate support]{.underline} for nuclear weapons -- it's likely to die out.

**Kim 24** -- James D. Kim is Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Security Studies Program. (James
D.; \"Dousing South Korea's nuclear desires\"; East Asia Forum;

[The fundamental [cause of]{.mark} [South Koreans' desire]{.mark} [to go
nuclear is]{.mark} their **[fear of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is
why it is hard to reassure South Koreans by simply promising more
security. The [[experience]{.mark} of a full-scale
[invasion]{.mark}]{.underline} of the south [[during]{.mark} the [Korean
War]{.mark} continues to [have]{.mark} a strong [influence on]{.mark}
South Korean **[psychology]{.mark}** today]{.underline}. [They [fixate
on]{.mark} the **[worst-case]{.mark}** scenario]{.underline} --- another
catastrophic war breaking out on the Korean peninsula. The horror of war
[[inflates]{.mark} South Koreans' [feelings of insecurity]{.mark} and
drives them to seek the ultimate military weapon that has proven
effective in deterring high-level conflicts like nuclear
attacks]{.underline}.

It is well known that [[older generations]{.mark} in South Korea [are
more supportive]{.mark} of nuclear armament, [with]{.mark} a much
[**greater gap** between]{.mark} [wartime and post-war
gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. But because there are so many
underlying differences between these two generations, it is inconclusive
whether their behavioural differences are caused by wartime trauma.

[[People who **lived** through]{.mark} the **[terrible
violence]{.mark}** of the Korean War [are more fearful]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the current [North Korean]{.mark} nuclear [threats]{.mark}
than those who remained relatively safe during the war]{.underline}.
They [[do not want]{.mark} to [rely on]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} alliance
[for security]{.mark}]{.underline} and prefer to build up their own
military power to defend themselves against external threats. [As a
result, they are more supportive of the acquisition of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

Many polls have shown that [[older men]{.mark} are the [most
vocal]{.mark} supporters]{.underline} of nuclear weapons. This is
because this demographic saw firsthand just how disastrous war can be.
People who lived through the Korean War overestimate both the
possibility of the peninsula becoming a battleground again and the
chances that the United States will abandon South Korea in a security
crisis. [[This is why]{.mark}, even after controlling for the effect of
political ideology, [their desire]{.mark} to possess nuclear weapons
[remains unwavering]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Younger people believe]{.mark} [war]{.mark} with North Korea is [less
likely]{.mark}]{.underline} and are less scared when faced with the same
level of threat. [They have [grown up]{.mark} [witnessing]{.mark} many
North Korean [provocations and]{.mark} are [**comforted** by]{.mark}
their [experience that]{.mark} these **[provocations never
escalated]{.mark}** into an all-out war.]{.underline}

The evidence suggests that one possible nuclear non-proliferation
strategy in South Korea is to maintain the status quo and wait for the
war generation to die off. By 2033, the war generation will make up only
4.2 per cent of the population, down from 2023's 16.8 per cent. Most of
the war generation will be in their 80s by the 2030s, causing a sharp
decline compared to the previous decade's 4.9 per cent point drop.

South Korea elected its first post-war generation president in 2022 and
this trend is expected to continue. As the war generation's influence
declines, South Korea will be less determined to develop its own nuclear
weapons.

Undoubtedly, [South Koreans' current support for nuclear armament goes
beyond just the war generation. But the [war generation]{.mark} are the
ones who provide unwavering support and their [position]{.mark} on
nuclear armament [is less affected by external
factors]{.mark}.]{.underline} Younger cohorts are more likely to
strategically alter their views about nuclear weapons in response to the
evolving security environment. [[According to]{.mark} a [recent]{.mark}
[K]{.mark}orea [I]{.mark}nstitute for [N]{.mark}ational
[U]{.mark}nification [report, more than **half**]{.mark} of [respondents
**withdrew**]{.mark} their **[support]{.mark}** for nuclear development
[after]{.mark} [learning about]{.mark} its [costs, such as]{.mark} the
possibility of **economic [sanctions]{.mark}** on South
Korea.]{.underline}

[[As]{.mark} the [war generation declines]{.mark}, South Koreans' [views
on nuclear armament]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} [increasingly
contingent]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the secu[rity
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This dependence will [[open
up]{.mark} the [possibility]{.mark} that US and South Korean
[policy]{.mark} decisions may be able to somewhat **[control]{.mark}**
the South Korean [**public's desire** for nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Kenneth [[Waltz was an advocate of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}. He was a strong supporter of
"Rational Deterrence Theory". He believed the world would be safer if
more countries had nuclear weapons. According to Waltz, [[proliferation
would bring more peace for the following reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Nuclear weapons make war less likely because nuclear weapons [[encourage
both defense and deterrence]{.underline}.]{.mark} The possibility of
total annihilation in a nuclear war makes states more careful and
miscalculation more difficult. Nuclear weapons dissuade attack both on
home territory and on vital strategic interests. [[Weak and small
countries will not use nuclear weapons
irresponsibly]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is a good chance that they
will be defeated in a conventional war. Nukes are their last resort, so
they will save their nukes for final battles. They will only use those
nukes if survival is at stake, certainly not for reckless invasion. It
is not possible to completely stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons
because states will continuously attempt to improve their security
environment. [[In a nuclear war both parties will be destroyed, so no
one will be tempted to use nuclear weapons in a war.]{.mark}
[Nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [act as a deterrent force]{.mark};
meaning, if you have nuclear bombs other countries will be discouraged
to initiate a war in the first place for the fear of nuclear
annihilation. [A state calculates the costs and benefits before going to
war]{.mark}. If costs outweigh benefit then there will be no incentives
to start a war[. In a nuclear war, there are no benefits; it will only
increase your costs, so nuclear weapons can prevent wars.]{.mark} The
acquisition of [nuclear]{.mark} weapon[s]{.mark} [make]{.mark}s [states
"exceedingly cautious"]{.mark} [and they will not fight if they can't
win much and stand to lose everything]{.mark}. Prominent realist thinker

[Several months ago, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists published [an
article by]{.mark} Zak [Kallenborn in which he defended nuclear weapons
and their utility]{.mark}. [Rebuttal]{.mark} articles published made two
fundamental arguments.]{.underline} First, realism predicts the
unavoidability of war, which requires the elimination of nuclear
weapons. Second, deterrence is unreliable because previous close calls
predict future failure. The [[authors believe that reducing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} to \[near\] zero limits the danger in
inevitable future wars because future cheating or proliferation would
only take place in small numbers, thereby limiting the damage of nuclear
use. [History and game theory [prove this argument dangerously
flawed]{.mark}. [For two millennia, major power wars occurred several
times per century]{.mark}. [Oxford]{.mark}'s Max Roser [charts]{.mark}
this bloody [cost over the past 600 years. In that time 5--10 people per

Beyond this regional challenge in the Middle East lurks a global threat

Nearly sixty years after the Cuban missile crisis and thirty years after

research that went into his new book, Nuclear Folly: A History of the
Cuban Missile Crisis. [As he [argues]{.mark} in the book, more often
than not, the [Americans and Soviets]{.mark} misread each other,
[operated under false information]{.mark}, [and came]{.mark} perilously
[close to nuclear catastrophe]{.mark}. [Despite these errors, the
military conflict was ultimately avoided for]{.mark} one central reason:

[Still, [MAD is influential in a number of ways]{.mark}. First, other
countries, like [China]{.mark}, have [not abandoned the idea that
holding their adversaries\' cities at risk is necessary to assure their
own strategic security]{.mark}. [Nor have U.S. and allied security
officials]{.mark} and experts fully abandoned the idea. At a minimum,
[acquiring nuclear weapons is still viewed as being sensible to face off
a hostile neighbor that might strike one\'s own
cities.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, our diplomats have been warning China
that Japan would be under tremendous pressure to go nuclear if North
Korea persisted in acquiring a few crude weapons of its own. [Similarly,
[Israel]{.mark}i officials have long [argued]{.mark}, without criticism,
that [they would]{.mark} not be second in [acquir]{.mark}ing
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} in the Middle East. Indeed, [given
that]{.mark} Israel is surrounded by [enemies]{.mark} that [would not
hesitate to destroy its population if they could]{.mark},]{.underline}
Washington finds Israel\'s retention of a significant nuclear capability
totally \"understandable.\" [Then, there is the case of [India and
Pakistan]{.mark}, two countries allied with the United States in its war
against terror. Regarding these countries\' nuclear arsenals, U.S.
experts argue, is to help these nations [secure their nuclear
capabilities against theft]{.mark}. [To]{.mark} help \"[stabilize\"
the]{.mark} [delicate]{.mark} nuclear [balance]{.mark} between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}, they argue, it might be useful for the United
States to help enhance each country\'s nuclear command and control
systems. Yet, U.S. officials have opposed these two nations\' efforts to
perfect their arsenals for battlefield applications and nuclear
war-fighting use. Instead, U.S. officials have urged both India and
Pakistan to keep their forces to the lowest possible levels and develop
them only for deterrent purposes. This is understood to mean only
targeting each others\' major cities.

enough to weigh in (19%), and 9 percent say they make the United States
less safe. Interestingly, Republicans are much more likely than
Democrats to say that nuclear weapons make the United States safer (60%
vs. 44%). This disparity may be due to stronger beliefs among GOP
supporters that maintaining military superiority is a very effective way
to achieve US foreign policy goals (66% of Republicans vs. 42% of
Democrats, per the 2022 Chicago Council Survey). Perhaps [the result of

Suppressing Vertical Proliferation

[hoarded]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [for years]{.underline} in an attempt
[[to remain]{.mark} **militarily [ahead]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
rest of the world. Since 1945, these states have worked tirelessly to
develop and advance their nuclear weapons programs, while forbidding
other states from creating nuclear weapons.

[These states]{.underline} have always [strive]{.underline}d [to
maintain their **superiority** [over]{.mark} the **[nuclear
"have-nots,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} most prominently [through
the]{.underline} Non-proliferation Treaty
(**[[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Articles I, II, and III of the treaty
expressly discourage the exchange of fissile material with]{.underline}
NNWS ([non-nuclear weapon states]{.underline}) for the purposes of
nuclear armament. On the other hand, [the clause for
disarmament]{.underline} -- Article VI -- [has
**[intentionally]{.mark}** been kept [**ambiguous** to
grant]{.mark}]{.underline} the NWS ([[nuclear weapon
states]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[a **means to retain** their
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} without violating the terms of the treaty.

In this scenario, Kenneth Waltz outlines the significance of existential
deterrence whereby the mere presence of nuclear weapons serves as an
adequate deterrent for full-scale war. He argues that [a system driven
by nuclear exploitation can only exist in [harmony]{.mark} if nuclear
parity remains]{.underline}, and [parity can [only]{.mark} be [attained
through]{.mark} the [**horizontal proliferation** of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s across the **globe**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Kenneth Waltz points out that [the attainment of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} will work as a means to [lower the security dilemma
at a strategic level that will **inhibit** the states from engaging in
full-scale war with each other]{.underline}. He does recognize that
limited or conventional skirmishes will continue inevitably, but [the
[presence of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} will considerably **[lower
the chances of World War III]{.mark}** breaking out]{.underline}.

The World After 1945

Through [Waltz]{.underline}'s lens, the world has seen strategic peace
for the past sixty years since the United States bombed Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. He [attributes]{.underline} this "[peace]{.underline}"---which
he defines as the "general absence of war among the major states of the
world"---[to the invention of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. He
recognizes, however, that the use of nuclear weapons for offensive
purposes will be nothing short of catastrophic for the world, but that
[these [weapons serve as a]{.mark} great **[defensive tool]{.mark}** to
**inhibit** the **escalation** to full-scale war]{.underline}.

Also Read: Alexander Dugin and His Idea of Russia

Furthermore, he calls attention to the fact that [[conflict is a
constant feature of the **anarchic world**]{.mark} that cannot be
discarded [but]{.mark} that the presence of [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} as a deterrent aids in [maintain]{.mark}ing
**[strategic stability]{.mark}** among states at a global
level]{.underline}. [The Cold War is]{.underline} perhaps [the biggest
evidence to support this]{.underline} claim. Though there was a war
between two global superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union)
who had a large plethora of nuclear arsenals at their disposal, [it did
not witness the rivals utilize these weapons against each
other]{.underline}.

The war lasted nearly four decades; however, [neither]{.underline} of
the [state]{.underline}s [dared to employ these WMDs]{.underline} for
their own benefit. Instead, they engaged in proxy wars centered on other
developing states, such as Vietnam, Cuba, and South Korea. Why did they
choose to do that?

Kenneth Waltz answers this through the concept of mutual assured
destruction (MAD). He states that [an attack of such a magnitude as
observed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki would lead to complete annihilation,
and that was not the goal of the war]{.underline}. [The goal was to
establish a unipolar world with either one of these two states acting as
the hegemon]{.underline}. If the United States had deployed nuclear
weapons on the Soviet Union's territory, the massive retaliatory nuclear
attack would've wiped out the USA. This [**mutual destruction** deterred
the two states from engaging in a nuclear war]{.underline}.

Moreover, the world had already seen the horrific consequences of a
nuclear attack on Japan, and the United States was already under
scrutiny for launching the attack in the first place. If the USA were to
use nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union, its integrity as a
rational state would be in jeopardy and its status as the hegemon would
be challenged on the grounds of erratic military decisions.

The Hoax of the Nuclear Umbrella

[NATO]{.underline} (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) has [cemented
itself as the key provider of nuclear security to states that do not
have their own nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. These states rely upon the
United States to grant them nuclear support in case of conflict with
states that have their own nuclear weapons. This "nuclear umbrella" has
been seen as a monumental step towards curtailing the horizontal
proliferation of nuclear weapons all the while granting nuclear security
to states that are in need of it. It goes to show that even NWFS that
promote Sagan's view of "more may be worse" recognize the perks of
nuclear weapons as a mode of deterrence and security.

Unfortunately, the foolproof [[efficacy of the **nuclear umbrella**
exists **solely in theory**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The recent
[Russia-Ukraine]{.underline} conflict has [shed light on America's
hesitation to employ nuclear weapons]{.underline} in order
[to]{.underline} offer [support]{.underline} to [Ukraine]{.underline}.
Although international scholars do point out that Ukraine was not an
explicit member of NATO when the conflict broke out, they also
acknowledge the extensive extent of American encouragement to join NATO
despite Putin's vehement discouragement regarding the endeavor.

As a result, Ukraine was left to fend for itself in the face of attacks
from the conventionally stronger Russia without any nuclear help from
NATO. This fateful encounter has left deep doubts about the efficacy and
reliability of the nuclear umbrella. Japan and South Korea, especially,
have realized the gravity of this situation and wish to establish their
own nuclear plants to avoid such a fate as Ukraine in the future by
China or North Korea.

This debacle consolidates Waltz's positive view of states acquiring
nuclear weapons for their own security. [[If **nuclear optimism** had
prevailed]{.underline}]{.mark} in accordance with Waltz's principles,
[**[Ukraine would not be suffering]{.mark}** at the hands of Russia and
would be at the mercy of the USA for nuclear support]{.underline}.
Ukraine must also regret liquidating its own nuclear weapons with the
recent resurgence of conflict.

In 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukraine was left
with nuclear arsenals and nuclear plants on its territory that
previously belonged to the USSR. In 1994, however, Ukraine signed the
NPT and liquidated its nuclear weapons in an attempt to ensure a
nuclear-free future. In light of the recent events that have taken place
between Russia and Ukraine, the latter would have greatly benefited if
it had held onto its nuclear weapons, as it would have acted as a means
to deter Russia from attacking Ukrainian territory.

The Peril of Non-State Actors and Rogue Nations

The international community has, for decades, pondered over the adverse
effects of normalizing nuclear weapons across the globe. [The most
prominent issue with proliferation]{.underline}, they argue,
[is]{.underline} what would happen if [non-state actors or rogue
states]{.underline} acquired these monstrous weapons. The [**pessimists
insist** that this would lead to]{.underline} a new wave of terrorism
that they categorize as **[[nuclear terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The presence of nuclear weapons, coupled with the irrational nature of
non-state actors, increases the prospect of a nuclear war tenfold.
Moreover, Sagan points out the lingering threat of non-state actors
stealing fissile materials and generators to build their own nuclear
power plants; or, they could craft dirty bombs with uranium and deploy
them on state territories.

Kenneth Waltz disagrees with this narrative. [The **[lack]{.mark} of
[precedents]{.mark}** for such an event ever happening in
history]{.underline}, he states, [disproves the severity of the threat
at hand]{.underline}. [[Rogue states]{.underline}]{.mark} and non-state
actors [[have **never hijacked** any]{.mark} other state's [nuclear
program]{.mark}]{.underline}. Waltz argues that this is [[due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} these actors [[**limited intellectual
capabilities** and the **vast structure** of a nuclear
plant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[A nuclear plant is seldom centered in one spot]{.underline}. It's a
dismantled system spread across different areas; therefore, a non-state
actor would have to acquire all the parts of a nuclear plant from
various securely guarded areas, which would be close to impossible due
to the technical expertise required for the task. Additionally,
[all]{.underline} these [parts are marked with a tracking device that
monitors their movement]{.underline}. [If a theft]{.underline} of this
[nature were to occur]{.underline}, [[it would be **incredibly easy** to
**capture**]{.mark} the [assailants]{.mark} before disaster]{.underline}
struck.

[In a hypothetical scenario where these actors can somehow successfully
steal parts of a nuclear plant, the assembly process would be too
intricate for them to carry out]{.underline}. Additionally,
[HEU]{.underline} (highly enriched uranium)---needed to start a chain
fission reaction---needs to be stored at an [optimum temperature in a
specific container to ensure it works properly in the
reactor]{.underline}, which the non-state actors do not know of.

Concerning dirty bombs, Kenneth Waltz argues that they do not cause
total annihilation or a catastrophe of a level recorded in Japan. Dirty
bombs' entire purpose is to spread radioactivity in an area. Its scope
is rather limited, which inhibits it from causing mass destruction.
Waltz affirms that [the threat of nuclear weapons being used by
non-state actors is a **deluded hogwash** that is **unsupported** by any
evidence]{.underline}.

Rogue states such as North Korea have been dragged into the
international system for being too irrational to have nuclear weapons.
Waltz highlights that [rationality is a contested concept that does not
have a codified set of instructions]{.underline}.
**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [[may
be labeled as]{.mark} an [irrational]{.mark} rogue state]{.underline},
[[but it has **never engaged** in a nuclear war with any
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It has utilized]{.underline}]{.mark}
nuclear weapons for what they are worth: as [[a
**deterrent**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Inadvertent Nuclear War

[Sagan claims that horizontal proliferation will pave the way for
inadvertent nuclear war among states]{.underline}, even if they did not
intend to engage in nuclear conflicts among each other. He asserts that
miscalculation and miscommunication may lead to an accidental nuclear
war that could destroy the world. Waltz agrees that human error may play
a crucial role in the utilization of nuclear weapons for offensive
purposes and instances such as the Cuban missile crisis and the Pulwama
crisis highlight the apparent risk of accidental full-scale war among
states.

However, Waltz also points out that [[in each
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}, [both the conflicting [states had
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} at their disposal [but chose not to
deploy]{.mark} them,]{.underline} [even though]{.underline} their
[animosity]{.underline} for each other [ran]{.underline} very
[deep]{.underline}. Waltz attributes this restraint to the cost-benefit
of engaging in a full-scale nuclear war. [Even if a miscellaneous
**[accidental attack]{.mark}** does take place, it [would]{.mark} most
likely [be at the **conventional level**]{.mark} without nuclear
weapons]{.underline} (as was observed in the Pulwama crisis). In this
situation, the response inarguably dictates the outcome of the conflict.
[[A state would **rationally avoid nuclear escalation** as it is
**cost-inefficient**]{.mark}, **[mutually destructive]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} largely **[counterintuitive]{.mark}** to the goals of the
war]{.underline}.

[The Cuban missile]{.underline} crisis has been dubbed as a classic
representation of miscommunication in a war-like scenario. Waltz
iterates that the crisis [did not lead to nuclear escalation due to
miscommunication]{.underline}, but Sagan argues that it just as easily
could have. In response, the optimist asserts that such a
miscommunication could exist in a centralized form of C&C (command and
control). Furthermore, [the threat of accidental war could be diminished
through betting the C&C systems by incorporating a decentralized form of
communication that requires a unanimous decision by all the people
involved]{.underline}. This would take away the risk of miscommunication
in a war-like scenario and pave the way for a peaceful use of nuclear
weapons.

Ukrainian and European nuclear deterrence

Notwithstanding, the evolving security landscape in Europe has
introduced new uncertainties. In particular, [the **growing divide**
between the **U**nited **S**tates and its **European partners** has
reignited discussions on European nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.\[15\]
[[Smaller powers]{.underline}]{.mark} seem to [[no longer trust]{.mark}
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}'s promises.\[16\] On 5 March, French
President Emmanuel Macron reiterated the idea of extending France's
nuclear deterrent to European partners.\[17\] Friedrich Merz, likely to
be the next German chancellor, expressed his openness to the idea.\[18\]

In our view,\[19\] [concerns exist as to whether expanding France's
deterrent]{.underline} -- currently considered minimal compared to
Russia's -- [would result in a credible enough force]{.underline}.\[20\]
So, the question remains: will this evolving idea of a European
deterrent serve to protect Ukraine?

The Polish factor

[[In the emerging global]{.mark} nuclear [order]{.mark}, [**European
nuclear deterrence** is no longer the]{.mark} sole [concern of
**France**]{.mark}, [**Germany** or the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[K]{.mark}**ingdom]{.underline}. [[Poland]{.mark} has recently
[voiced]{.mark} its [interest in nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear
weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} on two occasions -- either [[by
developing its own arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark} or by hosting US nuclear
weapons.\[21\]

Would President Trump consider deploying US tactical nuclear weapons on
Polish territory, particularly given that such a move would be
unacceptable to Putin? [[Russia has]{.mark} consistently
[insisted]{.mark} on [the **removal**]{.mark} [of **NATO military
infrastructure** from the **territories** of new member states as a key
condition for peace with Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Deploying
**[American]{.mark}** nuclear [weapons in **Poland**]{.mark} would
**[directly challenge]{.mark}** these [demands]{.mark},]{.underline}
potentially **[[escalating tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Against this backdrop, [[could Poland]{.underline}]{.mark} -- one of
Ukraine's staunchest allies in the war -- [[become]{.mark} instead
[Kyiv's partner in **nuclear cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}?
[Ukraine possesses the necessary materials and expertise, while [Poland
offers]{.mark} relative **[security]{.mark}**, **[political
ambition]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a rapidly **expanding [defence]{.mark}**
sector, with military spending reaching 4.7 per cent of
GDP]{.underline}.

Most importantly, [[both]{.mark} Poland and Ukraine [have expressed
interest in nuclear capabilities as a **response** to perceived
**Russian aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in order [to
establish]{.mark} a [**credible defence** against]{.mark}]{.underline}
potential [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n military action[s]{.underline}.
Both countries have historical experiences of Russian domination and
view nuclear weapons as a potential equaliser in the face of Russia's
superior conventional forces.

The Polish prime minister cited a similar assessment by NATO\'s new
Supreme Allied Commander, Alexus Grynkevich, with whom he had spoken a

Tusk of Poland on Friday said his country must drastically increase the
size of its military and even "reach for opportunities related to
nuclear weapons."

Mr. Tusk, in a detailed speech on security to the Polish Parliament, did
not explicitly propose developing a nuclear arsenal, but said that "it
is time for us to look boldly at our possibilities of having the most
modern weapons" and explore options for nuclear and "modern
unconventional weapons."

He added that his government was "talking seriously" with France,
Europe's only nuclear power aside from Britain and Russia, about the
possibility of extending the French nuclear umbrella to other European
countries. In addition, he said, Poland needs to ensure that all adult
men are "trained in the event of war."

Poland is a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which
prohibits countries that were not among five declared nuclear powers in
1970, when the treaty took effect, from acquiring atomic weapons.

But Israel, India and Pakistan, which never signed onto the ban, and
North Korea, which withdrew from the treaty, have all developed nuclear
weapons, and there has been sporadic discussion in Poland of trying to
join the nuclear club. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of Poland's former
governing party, said in 2022 that he would, "as a citizen," like to see
Poland acquire nuclear weapons but added: "As a responsible politician,
I must assess this idea as unrealistic."

Russian officials have suggested repeatedly that they could use nuclear
arms in the fight against Ukraine, which is not a NATO member,
particularly if the West ramps up its military aid to Ukraine. But
repeated escalations in that aid so far have not prompted such a
response.

The French Institute of International Relations warned in a report last
year that "the war in Ukraine has the potential to increase
proliferation risks, as it signals that nuclear powers can attack an
adversary with conventional capabilities while backing its actions with
nuclear threats to deter third-party intervention."

"The war also sends the message that nuclear weapons are a necessary
guarantor of national security," the report said.

When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991, Ukraine held on its territory
the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal but relinquished it in 1994,
in return for a pledge from Russia, as well as the United States and
Britain, to respect Ukrainian borders and refrain from the use or threat
of military force. Many Ukrainians now regret giving up this arsenal, as
their government has appealed in vain for NATO membership and direct
involvement of Western forces in the war.

Poland is the biggest military power among former members of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance that are now members of NATO.
But those nations have long looked to the United States, with its
nuclear arsenal and thousands of troops stationed in Poland and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, as the guarantor of its security.

Poland has a long tradition of nuclear expertise, dating to Marie
Sklodowska-Curie, the Polish-born French scientist who won Nobel Prizes
in physics and chemistry for her pioneering work in discovering
radioactivity --- a word she coined --- and radioactive elements in the
early 20th century. Stanislaw Ulam, a Polish mathematician and
physicist, played an important role in the Manhattan Project, the United
States' secret atomic bomb program during World War II, and in the
subsequent invention of the hydrogen bomb.

Under Communism, Poland trained a large group of nuclear engineers in
preparation for a nuclear power plant that it started building with
Soviet assistance but never finished. Poland last year approved plans
for the construction of its first atomic power station under a contract
with America's Westinghouse Electric.

Mr. Tusk dedicated most of his speech to the new security situation
created by Mr. Trump's abrupt upending of what had been the pillars of
American foreign policy since the end of World War II.

"We cannot deny these facts: Today, Poland's situation, objectively, and
Ukraine's situation, in particular, is more difficult than it was a few
months ago, and we must deal with this fact," he said.

"[**[Washington's]{.mark}** much more [symmetrical **attitude** toward
Moscow and Kyiv]{.mark}, much more symmetrical than we had become
accustomed to, [is]{.mark} a little **[different]{.mark}** --- I am also
**[putting it mildly]{.mark}** --- [from what we feel in
**Poland**]{.mark} or in Europe]{.underline}," he said.

But Mr. Tusk avoided criticism of Mr. Trump and said the "closest
possible ties" with the United States remained essential.

At the same time, he said Poland would expand its military to around
half a million personnel, including reservists, more than double its
current size, and raise spending on defense to 5 percent of its economic
output.

But Mr. Tusk ruled out sending Polish soldiers to Ukraine "as part of
some contingent," an apparent reference to French proposals that
European countries provide troops for a future security force if U.S.
efforts to broker a peace deal bear fruit.

Poland is already one of Europe's biggest spenders on defense, spending
around 4 percent of gross domestic product last year, double the 2
percent minimum set by NATO for its member nations. Most NATO countries
are above that threshold now, unlike during Mr. Trump's first term, when
he berated them for not spending more, but he continues to question the
U.S. obligation to defend its allies.

Poles, Mr. Tusk said, "will not accept the philosophy that we are
powerless and helpless, that [if President Trump decides to change his
policy]{.underline}, [we have no chance]{.underline}."

"I will repeat once again what seems incredible but is true: [[**500
million Europeans** are **begging 300 million Americans** to protect us
from]{.underline}]{.mark} 180 million [Russian]{.mark}s who have not
been able to cope with 40 million Ukrainians for three years," he said.

Europe has the means to defend itself but needs to "eliminate one
important deficit," he added --- "the lack of will to act, uncertainty
and, sometimes, even cowardice."

## China Deterrence Turn

### Proliferation Good\-\--China Deterrence\-\--Toplevel

Taiwan?\", Week,

[[China\'s attempt to **conquer Taiwan**]{.mark} by force \"[could be
**imminent**]{.mark}\"]{.underline}, US Secretary of Defence Pete
Hegseth has warned.

\"There\'s no reason to sugarcoat it: [the threat China poses is
real]{.underline},\" he said, speaking at the 2025 Shangri-la Dialogue
defence summit in Singapore. [[Beijing is]{.mark} \"**[credibly
preparing]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} potentially use military force to
[**alter** the **balance of power** in the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}]{.underline}\". And, \"to be clear: [any
attempt by Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would result in
devastating consequences for the Indo-Pacific and the
world.]{.underline}\"

[[Beijing views Taiwan as a **rogue breakaway**]{.mark} **territory** to
be brought back under control]{.underline}, by force if necessary,
making it arguably \"the most dangerous place on Earth\", said The
Economist.

How likely is an invasion?

Experts \"disagree about the likelihood and timing of a Chinese
invasion\", said the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

[[China]{.mark} has been [engaging in]{.mark}]{.underline}
\"unprecedented [[**aggression** and **military
modernisation**]{.underline}]{.mark}\", Admiral Samuel Paparo, the
commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the US Congressional Armed
Services Committee in April. Underscoring the seriousness of this
escalation, he said China\'s drills around Taiwan are \"[[not]{.mark}
just [exercises]{.mark} -- **[they are
rehearsals]{.mark}**]{.underline}\".

While \"alarming\", said the Atlantic Council, this \"unfortunately
reflects a broader, consistent trend\" of escalating activities by the
People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), including persistent crossings of the
Taiwan Strait\'s median line.

Data from Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defence found that sorties
across the Taiwanese-declared dividing line between Taiwan and China
have increased from 953 incidents in 2021 to 3,070 in 2024.

There are other indications Beijing is preparing to move on Taiwan.
[[China has been **stockpiling**]{.mark} **record amounts of
[gold]{.mark}**, which could be part of a strategy [to
**defend**]{.mark} itself [from **Western sanctions**]{.mark} in the
event of an attack on Taiwan]{.underline}. [[It has also been
building]{.mark} a s**olid [legal ground]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} a
potential [invasion]{.mark}, aiming to **frame the attack** as a
legitimate **internal matter**.]{.underline}

\"This will help the country to delay a collective security and economic
response from the West,\" said The Sun.

When could an invasion happen?

Paparo told members of Congress that the PLA are \"stretching their
legs\" to meet President [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping\'s military readiness goal
of being [**capable** of taking Taiwan by force by
**2027**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That year is seen as \"magical\" because
it marks the centenary of what was to become the People\'s Liberation
Army, said Robert Fox in London\'s The Standard.

\"Others believe 2049 is a critical date,\" said the CFR, as Xi Jinping
has \"emphasised that unification with Taiwan is essential to achieving
what he calls the Chinese Dream, which sees China\'s great-power status
restored by 2049\".

How could an invasion start?

Chinese military drills last year surrounded Taiwan\'s main island with
joint exercises by all branches of the PLA and \"for the first time, the
increasingly militarised Coast Guard\", said The Guardian.

In January, Naval News first reported the construction of new amphibious
barges at Guangzhou Shipyard, in southern China.

These [[new]{.mark} barge-like [**Shuiqiao** ships
are]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[a
**game-changer**]{.underline}]{.mark} for Beijing and provide \"insight
into China\'s integration of its military, paramilitary and civilian

Guardian.

[The barges feature bridges [that]{.mark} could be used to [**transport
tanks** and **supplies** over previously **uncrossable
land**]{.mark}]{.underline}, said The Telegraph, giving them multiple
fronts for an invasion and [\"**thinning out**\" Taiwan\'s line of
**defence**.]{.underline}

The likely strategy is to overwhelm Taiwan with a massive attack with
little warning.

That would mean in the early hours of a Chinese invasion, the narrow
strait separating the island from the mainland would likely be
\"transformed into a ferocious battlefield\", said Business Insider.
Aside from deploying more traditional weapons such as missiles or
warships, \"vast fleets of unmanned aerial and naval drones will likely
darken the skies and hide beneath waves, bringing with them a deadly
threat that Taiwan and its allies are ill-prepared to counter\". During
Joe Biden\'s presidency, the US strategy to counter this -- dubbed
\"Hellscape\" -- hinged on deploying thousands of new drones that would
swarm the Taiwan Strait and keep China\'s military busy until more help
could arrive.

How would it play out?

[[Chinese action]{.mark} against Taiwan [would]{.mark} be an \"**act of
war that [spark]{.mark}s a [global crisis]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}, said
The Wall Street Journal. \"[It would provoke a military response by
Taiwan, force President Trump to decide whether the US military should
help defend the island, disrupt global trade and impel European nations
to impose punishing sanctions on Beijing]{.underline}.\"

If [[a conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} were to break out it [[would
b]{.mark}e \"a **[catastrophe]{.mark}**\",]{.underline} said the
Economist. This is first because of \"the bloodshed in Taiwan\", but
also [because of the [risk]{.mark} of \"[**escalation** between two
**nuclear powers**]{.mark}\"]{.underline}, namely the US and China.

Beijing massively outguns Taiwan, with estimates from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute showing that China spent about 23
times more on its military in 2021. The PLA also boasts more than two
million active soldiers. The US is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to
\"provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character\" and discourage
China from using force or coercion to achieve its goals regarding the
island. This could see Washington drawn into any conflict -- although
there is growing scepticism in Taipei that Trump would intervene
militarily in the event of a full-blown Chinese attack.

That means [any invasion \"would be one of the **most dangerous** and
**consequential events** of the **21st century**\"]{.underline}, said
The Times, and \"[would make the Russian attack on Ukraine look like a
sideshow by comparison\"]{.underline}.

weapons.4 Given this evidence, it appears likely that [China's

Horizontal Proliferation Before and After an Invasion of Taiwan

Should China attempt invading Taiwan, current non-nuclear states may
seek their own independent arsenals as a response to a seismic shift in
threat perceptions.5 As detailed below, each potential nuclear power is
unique, with varying degrees of capabilities and intentions, but each
state's leadership could reasonably conclude that the overriding lesson
of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is: those without nuclear weapons risk
Chinese military coercion and attack.

Japan

The U.S. government and outside analysts have long recognized that
[[**Japan** is a **latent nuclear power**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
**[technical means]{.mark}** and materials needed to achieve nuclear
weapons design and production]{.underline}.6
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} long
[[recognized Japan's]{.mark} latent nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} and has often criticized Japan for
retaining stockpiles of fissile material.7 Given a latent Japanese
nuclear capability, [China's leadership should recognize that
[any]{.mark} [attempt to invade Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, regardless
of success, [[would **incentivize Japan** in this
direction]{.underline}]{.mark}. While some analysts might argue that
Japan's anti-nuclear legacy will prevail and stymie any nuclear weapons
ambitions, China should be reminded that this predisposition has been
undermined in recent years, including by China. Japanese strategists are
well aware that [the threat to Japan from China has increased
dramatically]{.underline} in the past two decades. For example,
strategists in China have openly written about how a successful invasion
of Taiwan would allow the PLA Navy far greater access to the first
island chain with the resulting potential to break the Japan-U.S.
alliance because of the difficulty the United States would have in
supporting Japan from overseas.8 Indeed, [Japanese politicians have
begun openly to discuss not only rearming Japan]{.underline}, but have
raised the topic of nuclear deterrence.9 Japan views nuclear deterrence
as an essential element of its security strategy, although currently
that deterrence is supplied solely by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. As the
2021 annual Japanese Ministry of Defense report states, "In dealing with
the threat of nuclear weapons, U.S. extended deterrence, with nuclear
deterrence at its core, is essential: Japan will closely cooperate with
the United States."10 While Japanese officials typically do not
spotlight Japan's latent nuclear capabilities in public remarks, [former
Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba said]{.underline}, "[Japan should have
the technology to build a nuclear weapon if it wants to do
so.]{.underline}"11 If China were to use the threat of nuclear
escalation as an element of its invasion of Taiwan, Japanese leaders
would undoubtedly seek to increase their defense options, including
possibly acquiring nuclear weapons. As further evidence of the
possibility of proliferation, [[**Japanese leaders** have become
increasingly vocal about the **importance** of **Taiwan** for Japan's
security]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 For example, shortly after [[Shinzo
Abe]{.underline}]{.mark} resigned as Prime Minister of Japan, he
[[stated]{.mark} that even [an attack on]{.mark} an American vessel
transiting the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [could be considered the
**necessary trigger** for Japanese **self-defense actions**]{.mark} in
the region]{.underline}.13 [He]{.underline} then [stated]{.underline},
as noted previously, ["**[A Taiwan emergency is a Japan
emergency]{.mark}**. That is, it's an emergency for the US-Japan
alliance as well."]{.underline}14 Or, as Japan's deputy Defense Minister
Yasuhide Nakayama recently stated, "\... [[we have to protect Taiwan as
a democratic country]{.underline}]{.mark}."15 In addition, the 2021
Defense of Japan report notes that, "Stabilizing the situation
surrounding Taiwan is important for Japan's security\..."16 Potentially
adding to Japan's proliferation calculus, officials in China have
claimed parts of Japanese territory, such as the Senkaku Islands and
even the island of Okinawa---the host of a large U.S. military
base---establishing a justification for territorial aggression against
Japan.17 Adding even greater incentive, China could conceivably assert
its perceived historical claim on Okinawa in an attempt to eliminate the
island as a potential base for military operations against Beijing.
[Faced with such a prospect]{.underline}, [and perhaps a diminished
level of faith in U.S. conventional power and/or extended
deterrence]{.underline}, [Japan's leadership could decide that building
a nuclear arsenal is the best chance for ensuring Japan's national
survival]{.underline}. In fact, as Amb. Robert Joseph, former Under
Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, recently
stated, "Based on my discussions with Japanese officials, it would not
be surprising if a combination of an aggressive North Korea and a
successful Chinese invasion of Taiwan caused a fundamental shift in
Japanese views on the utility and desirability of nuclear weapons."18

Taiwan

Perhaps [[the ultimate **Chinese nightmare** future scenario
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} a failed invasion attempt against
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which, in response, restarts [efforts
to build its own [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taiwan
has reportedly independently explored the possibility seriously at least
twice before---first beginning in the early-to-mid 1970s, and again in
the mid-to-late 1980s.19 U.S. pressure apparently led Taiwan to cease
the program but, in the wake of an unsuccessful Chinese invasion
attempt, U.S. officials would be hard-pressed to tell Taiwan once again
to refrain. In fact, international pressure to call on Taiwan to cease
such a program might be lacking after an unsuccessful Chinese invasion.
Admittedly it is unknown how the Taiwanese leadership would act after a
failed Chinese invasion attempt, and Taipei might decide that the
difficulties and dangers of pursuing its own nuclear program would be
too costly to overcome---such as the lack of fissile material and
potentially endangering international support by pursuing a nuclear
weapons program. Additionally, much of the military and civilian
infrastructure that could contribute to a nuclear weapons program would
likely be destroyed during a failed Chinese invasion attempt. Yet China
cannot dismiss out of hand the possibility that following a failed
attempt to invade, Taiwan might try either to restart its nuclear
weapons program, or to obtain such weapons with the help of neighbors
who greatly fear China's expansionism.

South Korea

[[**South Korean** officials would likely have **multiple concerns**
about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, there
would be concern about the collapse of U.S. extended deterrence
credibility. Given its geographic location and its dependence on open
sea lanes, South Korea would likely fear a reduced or contested U.S.
naval presence in the Sea of Japan and East China Sea. Additionally,
[Seoul might fear that China's action against Taiwan would embolden
North Korea to use its nuclear threat to coerce or even invade South
Korea]{.underline}. In such a case, the **[[So]{.underline}]{.mark}**uth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean leadership might decide that having
its own nuclear [[deterrent would be essential]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
notion of enhanced nuclear security is already much on the minds of the
public in South Korea. According to polls, the majority of the South
Korean populace consistently approves of either re-deploying U.S.
nuclear weapons in South Korea, or South Korea developing its own
nuclear weapons---mostly with respect to deterring a North Korean
attack.20 Yet there is a growing sentiment in South Korea that China is
the greater threat to peace on the Korean peninsula.21 In fact, a recent
major study indicates that a majority of the population would support a
domestic nuclear weapons program that is focused on the threat from
China.22 Thus, from the standpoint of political will, [South Korea's
leadership may face little domestic resistance should it decide to
embark on a nuclear weapons program]{.underline} in the wake of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan. In addition, should Japan initiate a nuclear
weapons program, it would place additional pressure on South Korea's
leadership to pursue the same course, given the historical animosity
between the two states. As was the case with Taiwan, U.S. officials
reportedly have encouraged South Korean leaders in the past to refrain
from pursuing their own nuclear program but may be hard-pressed to do so
again following a successful Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the
potential Japanese response.23

Australia

[[**Australia** is a **key** U.S. ally with vital interests in the
**Indo-Pacific region**]{.underline}]{.mark}---factors that might prompt
Canberra to reassess its current non-nuclear weapon power status
following an invasion of Taiwan. Fearful of a waning U.S. presence in
the region and the degraded credibility of U.S. extended
deterrence---and having been the target of Chinese coercive economic
sanctions---Australian strategists have begun debating what once were
considered non-viable options: a nuclear weapon-sharing program with the
United Kingdom or United States, or development of its own domestic
nuclear weapons program.24 Home to a number of uranium mines, including
the world's largest uranium deposit, Australia has the material
necessary to become a nuclear weapon power should it choose to pursue
the necessary technology and delivery systems.25 Although the recent
official announcement of Australia's plans to purchase submarines
stressed that they will only be nuclear powered, China should account
for the possibility that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could prompt
Australia to reassess the submarines' conventional-only role.26

\...and Beyond

An invasion of Taiwan could spark [[additional
states]{.underline}]{.mark} to consider [[building their own nuclear
weapon programs]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond those examined above. The
pursuit of nuclear capabilities by Australia, Taiwan, Japan, or South
Korea could lead to a general breakdown in the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT), leading other states to seek a nuclear weapons
capability.27 Obviously, there are numerous uncertainties involved in
this possibility, but an invasion of Taiwan could certainly spur a
foundational reassessment of the threat environments that could catalyze
a vast new expansion of nuclear weapon states in the world---many of
which [[would be **opposed** to China]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or in
alliances with the United States. [[This prospect should be a
**deterring factor** in the **CCP's calculations** of costs versus
benefits]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[that can wreak havoc on any invading force]{.underline}, [regardless of

[As seen from the ongoing Russo-Ukraine War]{.underline}, [[a defending
party can still fight a war of **attrition**]{.underline}]{.mark},
utilizing cheap and effective asymmetric means of warfare to battle a
superior attacker to a standstill. This would be further aided by the
John Mearsheimer's 'stopping power of water' theory (large bodies of
water inhibit power projection by would- be hegemons), giving providence
to Japan's strategic location and need to invest in naval and air assets
as opposed to land assets, with South Korea centering its defense around
the DMZ.20 [This would therefore aid the concept of **[acquiring
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [as a **proven deterrent**]{.mark}
that [can be an ultimate **trump card**]{.mark} when combined with
effective **military procurements**]{.underline}.

In addition to hindering an offensive action, [[a nuclear deterrent

adopt an unorthodox strategy that would cause it to split its forces to

[[weakening]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential [[invasion
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[**raises** the **stakes** for any invading

at a time when global trade has reached record levels, thereby stifling
its economy and potential growth opportunities. While it is entirely

standing, its main [benefactors of [**Russia** and **China**
have]{.mark} significantly **m[ore to lose]{.mark}**]{.underline} if
they wish to maintain their export- based economies.

Even factoring in that North Korea's Kim dynasty has demonstrated an odd
preponderance for calculated unpredictability, [risking an invasion of
the South would be a **suicidal endeavor**]{.underline}. Unless the PRC
or Russia were willing to enable this, it would isolate North Korea to a
degree unprecedented in its history. [[Nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear

**[mitigate]{.mark}** the **risk** of **[No]{.mark}**]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea['[s]{.mark} [advantage]{.mark} in
military manpower while also forcing the North to risk a strategy that
may not work]{.underline} (such as Russia's belief that a decapitation
of Kiev would end the war early), concentrating on one central thrust
south that could be easily countered. Notwithstanding an invasion,
unmitigated aggression would almost certainly galvanize the democracies
of East Asia and the Pacific to form some sort of defensive alliance,
akin to NATO, balancing against the aggressor. This would have an
opposite effect, thereby pushing countries to adopt immediate
containment on aggression and force any invading party to consider a
fight against multiple militaries as opposed to just one.

[[With]{.mark} **President [Trump's hostility]{.mark}** [towards]{.mark}
the **[BRICS]{.mark} currency alliance**]{.underline}, [[it

[Russia and China]{.mark}]{.underline}. If North Korea, the PRC, or
Russia were to hedge their bets on avoiding international sanctions by
using a new currency, it would prove unlikely with the Trump
Administration's open hostility and desire to end the currency alliance.
This would adversely affect the market access of these countries,
thereby stopping the core enabler of a state to wage war: money.21

*\-\--mathematical symbols excluded due to text format*

Membership in the nuclear club has grown more slowly than many expected
during the Cold War (Yusuf 2009: 4). Robert McNamara, for instance,
predicted in 1963 that at least eight new states might develop weapons
within a decade1 and President Kennedy predicted that 15--25 new nuclear
powers could emerge by the 1970s (Yusuf 2009). Likewise, following
India's first explosion in 1974, the CIA listed 10 potential (and
likely) proliferators2 (Yusuf 2009: 19). The "Nth country" problem was a
central focus of the intelligence community and policymakers, yet the
status quo remains largely non-nuclear. We have seen far less horizontal
proliferation than expected---few new states have acquired nuclear
weapons---largely owing to the non-proliferation efforts of the nuclear
powers. It is clear that the structure of alignments in the
international system shapes proliferation, or the lack thereof; as Coe
and Vaynman (2015) show, superpower collusion to keep non-nuclear states
in compliance with the non-proliferation regime has been crucial to that
regime's success. Great powers' preferences over their protégés' nuclear
capabilities play a critical role in whether those protégés acquire
weapons in the first place. Yet without considering how these great
power preferences continue to come into play once other states do
acquire the bomb, we are only seeing part of the story of the effect
that nuclear weapons have on interstate relations. [How do the
[**incentives** of great power patrons]{.mark} [change in light of
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}? Put another way, how does expanding
the circle of nuclear-armed states affect the structure of the
international system? I show that, [in addition to the structure of
alignments shaping proliferation]{.underline},
[**[proliferation]{.mark}** itself [can]{.mark} also [shape]{.mark}
these **[alignment structures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and thereby the
international system itself, [[by **tightening
hierarchies**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This new claim is based on the introduction of great powers' preferences
regarding nuclear acquisition by their subordinates. I argue that, all
else equal, [[great powers pay a higher cost for the defeat of a
nuclear-capable ally than for the defeat of a non-nuclear
ally]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This higher cost leads [great powers]{.mark}
to [prefer]{.mark} that, [if an ally loses a conflict]{.mark}, [it is
not armed with nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. This new assumption
regarding great power preferences can allow us to theorize about how
these powers may be expected to respond not just to subordinate states'
nuclear pursuit, but also to their acquisition of a working weapon, and
in doing so tell us what the result for their hierarchical relationship
may be. The increased potential costs that arise with the emergence of a
nuclear-capable subordinate (caused by higher risks and costs of
conflict escalation, a greater likelihood of low-level conflict owing to
nuclear possession, or loss of control of vulnerable nuclear materials)
suggest that, [[once a state goes nuclear]{.underline}, [its patron may
have greater incentives to protect it]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[nuclear
states]{.mark} that pose a greater risk to the stability of a region may
[prompt]{.mark} a [heightened willingness to get involved from great
powers with]{.mark} a **vested [interest]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} that
**[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When great powers find the defeat
of a nuclear protégé costlier than the defeat of a non-nuclear one, I
find that [the protégé's proliferation may make a great power more
likely to intervene in a conflict on the subordinate's behalf,
transforming a previously incredible defensive commitment into a
credible one]{.underline}. [Where a great power is not expected to aid a
non-nuclear ally, it may do so for one that possesses a nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}.

The purpose of any weapons, nuclear or otherwise, is to influence the
actions of others, either through deterrence or compellence. It stands
to reason that the [acquisition of a weapon with as much potential for
devastation as an atomic bomb will influence what states in the system
will and will not do]{.underline}, or even consider doing.
[Relationships]{.underline} among not only adversaries but also allies
[will be altered whenever a **party joins** the **nuclear
club**]{.underline}. Much of the literature on nuclear proliferation has
considered the motivations of would-be nuclear powers and existing major
powers independently, and threatening states have often not been treated
as strategic actors in the process. Debs and Monteiro (2016) analyze a
model explicitly considering the interactions among these three actors,
creating a more comprehensive framework that considers states'
opportunity and willingness to build nuclear weapons as products of
their great power relationships and their threat environments. However,
[the role of the great power ally in their model is to provide cover for
a proliferator]{.underline}, potentially allowing a state to acquire a
weapon when it might not otherwise have been capable of doing so. Great
powers' incentives remain largely unexplored,3 particularly as they may
be altered by their protégés' nuclear pursuit. I show that while these
powers exert their influence within the distribution of alignments, they
in turn are also influenced and bound by it. Through proliferation,
subordinate states can shape this structure of alignments, which can be
seen in how they are able to change great powers' incentives with their
nuclear acquisition.

Working within this framework of proliferators, allies, and adversaries,
I develop a formal model that considers how **[[horizontal
proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in [which new states acquire
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [can shape the preferences of great power
patrons]{.underline}. I find that [proliferation by a subordinate state
[can make a great power **more likely to intervene**]{.mark} in a
conflict on the subordinate's behalf]{.underline}, [[**transforming** a
previously incredible **defensive commitment** into a credible
one]{.underline}]{.mark}. This suggests that, in acquiring nuclear
weapons, [states may]{.underline} not only [be]{.underline} providing
for their own security, but also [enhancing a great power's commitment
to that securit]{.underline}y. In addition to their defensive and
deterrent potential, nuclear weapons can have the previously unexamined
benefit of drawing great power allies closer to their protégés. Further,
[a credible defensive commitment cannot be made incredible through
nuclear acquisition]{.underline}, meaning that [[proliferators need not
fear that they will be abandoned after achieving nuclear
status]{.underline}]{.mark}. This possibility is driven by the
consideration of a particular incentive on the part of great powers: all
else equal, I posit that a loss by a nuclear ally is costlier for a
great power than a loss by a non-nuclear one. These results show that
the consequences of proliferation decisions are not only dependent upon
a state's existing relationships and position in the international
system, but they can in turn alter that very system.

Within this discussion[, I use the term "**ally**" to denote a state
that **falls within the hierarchy or sphere of influence of a great
power** or might otherwise be in a non-adversarial relationship with it,
but not necessarily one with any formal defense pact in
place]{.underline}. A more appropriate but also more cumbersome
descriptor might be "ally or potential ally," as I am really interested
in states that might reasonably expect a great power to come to their
assistance. Indeed, it is quite possible that this mechanism of drawing
in a great power and strengthening its formerly incredible defensive
commitment is most likely in cases that lack a formal alliance
agreement. Where defense pacts are already in place, they may in some
cases be structured so as to create credible commitments that do not
require further reassurance, and they may in other cases be part of a
strict hierarchical relationship in which the guarantor possesses
leverage over a subordinate to prevent proliferation. In neither of
these cases should we expect to see a great power's commitment altered
through nuclear acquisition (in the former because it is not necessary
and in the latter because it is not possible), and so it is reasonable
to think that this mechanism may be most visible where looser
relationships exist to begin with.

Causes and consequences of nuclear possession

Consideration of the effect of nuclear weapons on the international
system must involve both the causes and consequences of nuclear
proliferation. Regarding its causes, recent years have seen a
proliferation of studies on the determinants of nuclear weapons pursuit
and acquisition. Jo and Gartzke (2007) employ an "opportunity and
willingness" framework, laying out some of the factors commonly
associated with nuclear proliferation.4 Another way to frame this is as
a divide between the supply side and the demand side of proliferation:
whether states are able to acquire nuclear weapons, and why they might
want to.

On the supply side, the degree to which states can withstand military or
economic sanctions affects their ability to acquire nuclear weapons.
South Korea, for instance, relied heavily on US military and financial
assistance, including the presence of US troops, to ensure its security
following the Korean War, placing it in a position where threats of US
withdrawal effectively ended its efforts. Even if states find nuclear
possession attractive, they may be unable to develop a program to the
point of a working weapon if another state is able to impose
unacceptably high costs for doing so. Nuclear acquisition is an
expensive process, and opposition by great powers can render it even
more so. In addition to direct sanctioning, the act of nuclear pursuit
itself may also provoke preventive strikes and wars (Fuhrmann and Kreps
2010; Bas and Coe 2016; Debs and Monteiro 2016), which states must take
into account in their decision-making.5 The ability to proliferate
therefore depends not only on the resources and capacity of a state
seeking a weapon, but also on the interest and ability of other members
of the international system to oppose it in this pursuit.6

Relationships with other members of the international system also
underpin the demand-side literature, and in particular relationships
with adversaries and with great power allies. Security considerations
driving the perceived need for nuclear weapons center on external
threats and fears of abandonment. States with a high and persistent
level of threat, such as those in enduring rivalries or with
historically hostile neighbors, are more likely to find nuclear weapons
attractive for their deterrent and defensive purposes than those lacking
such an existential threat7. In line with Powell's (2003) argument that
nuclear weapons may allow small states to deter major powers in issues
where a small state is clearly more resolved than its opponent (such as
issues of "regime survival"), states facing threats to their survival
should find nuclear weapons more useful than states taking offensive
action. Fears of abandonment by a great power protector are also an
oft-cited impetus for states to pursue a nuclear capability (Reiter
2014; Debs and Monteiro 2016; Lanoszka 2018), and Gerzhoy (2015)
describes this abandonment as a threat often leveraged in attempts to
prevent proliferation. If the costs of defending a protégé are high,
great powers have incentives to renege on their security commitments in
the event of an attack, making them unreliable defenders. Subordinate
states may therefore wish to pursue nuclear weapons in order to provide
for their own defense.

[Regarding]{.underline} the [consequences]{.underline} of nuclear
possession, the [literature tends to focus on potential effects on
interactions between adversaries]{.underline}. Lines of inquiry on the
consequences of nuclear weapons examine how possession affects crisis
outcomes (Beardsley and Asal 2009; Kroenig 2013; Sechser and Fuhrmann
2013), how possession affects the probability of conflict (Rauchhaus
2009), and how nuclear postures might affect the likelihood of conflict
(Narang 2012). This work highlights the effect that nuclear weapons have
on relationships between opposing states, but [we should **also
consider** how these weapons might affect **less adversarial
relationships**]{.underline}, and how the nature of these relationships
might be changed over time. As Powell (2003) points out, small states
might use a nuclear capability to lessen the influence of a great power
over them, and I argue that they might sometimes also be able to exert
some power of their own in return.

Patron incentives

What is missing from this discussion is an explicit consideration of
great powers' incentives regarding nuclear acquisition by those within
their hierarchies or spheres of influence. I use the existing framework
of security concerns, particularly external threats and fears of
abandonment by great powers, to construct a model in which great power
protectors' preferences interact with these existing motivations for
proliferation by non-nuclear states. In this way, the model setup is
consistent with Debs and Monteiro's (2016) framework but adds an
explicit consideration of patrons' incentives within it. Works that do
consider the preferences of great power allies consider how protégés may
use their developing nuclear programs to leverage concessions from great
power allies. Bas and Coe (2018) present a model in which a state (such
as the US) can use a more generous deal than it would otherwise offer in
order to prevent another state from developing a nuclear weapon, while
Volpe (2017) considers the conditions under which a proliferating state
is best positioned to extract concessions in exchange for its program.
Their emphasis is on what proliferators may gain from great powers by
scaling back or giving up their nuclear programs, whereas I examine what
they may gain from those great powers by bringing their weapons programs
to fruition.

I suggest that, all else equal, [great powers prefer that if their
allies lose a conflict, those allies are not nuclear-armed]{.underline}.
That is, [great powers pay a higher cost for the defeat of a
nuclear-capable ally than for the defeat of a non-nuclear
ally]{.underline}. Concerns for regional stability help show why we
should expect this to be the case. [When nuclear-armed states are
involved]{.underline}, [there is an increased potential for escalation
to unacceptably costly levels]{.underline}. This may be especially
salient for a great power when the ally is of significant strategic
importance or is in a strategically important region that may be
destabilized. When nuclear weapons are involved, credibly threatening to
use them requires invoking an element of risk, Schelling's (1960)
"threat that leaves something to chance." As Powell (2003, 2015) frames
it, crises between nuclear states involve "bidding up the risk" until
the situation ends with either a side backing down or the crisis
escalating out of control, with the risk of such loss of control
increasing the longer both parties hold out. [In the face of a
conventionally superior]{.underline} opponent, [there is also the
possibility that a state will see a nuclear weapon as a last resort
option]{.underline}; Powell (2003) also demonstrates that [the balance
of [resolve can favor small states]{.mark} when it comes to nuclear use,
[making their **threats more credible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Any or
[all of these elements may be in play when a nuclear subordinate is
involved in a conflict]{.underline}, [causing great powers to expect
greater costs if that state suffers a defeat]{.underline}.

\[Pause paragraph breaks\]

In addition to the higher potential for escalation to catastrophic
levels that nuclear weapons introduce to a conflict, Rauchhaus (2009)
finds empirical support for the idea that, while nuclear weapons can
reduce the risk of large-scale war, they can increase lower-level
conflict. Although the casualty counts in these wars may be lower than
in higher-level conflicts, this implies an increased regional
instability, such that peace settlements from these conflicts may be
expected to be less durable and more open to revision. Great powers with
a preference for stability in these regions (owing to alliance
commitments, having their own forces deployed there, a reliance on
exports from the area, etc.) may anticipate that a nuclear-armed ally
that loses in a conflict will be less restrained in attempting to secure
a better outcome in the future. Even when nuclear weapons are not used
in a war, their presence may encourage conflicts that entail more
frequent losses. Similarly, Bell and Miller (2015) find that
nuclear-armed dyads are not less likely to go to war, but that dyads
with one nuclear state are more prone to conflict. If, as they argue,
nuclear acquisition encourages states to expand their interests, the
idea that nuclear-armed states may be more prone to retry their luck in
a new conflict after suffering a defeat holds. A further cause for
concern over regional stability is the potential for loose nuclear
material, or "loose nukes." In April 2009, then-President Obama called
for "an international effort to secure vulnerable nuclear material" (The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary 2009), making nuclear
security and preventing nuclear terrorism a focus of the Nuclear
Security Summit the following year. The US remains concerned about the
security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, for instance, even during
peacetime. These concerns stem primarily from fears of nuclear
trafficking and nuclear terrorism, and the security of this material
comes into further doubt during war.Model States may pursue nuclear
weapons in an attempt to ensure their own security when they lack a
credible great power commitment to defend them.8 Great powers,
meanwhile, can use sanctions or otherwise withdraw support to deter such
nuclear pursuit. My formal model shows that some states can be dissuaded
from building nuclear weapons by the potential for a patron to impose
costly sanctions. Further, even states with a credible security
commitment cannot always be prevented from building nuclear weapons; in
the face of a threat, states may still opt to proliferate if the cost of
sanctions is outweighed by the military boost from nuclear weapons or if
proliferation can deter an attack. These results are consistent with
existing theories of proliferation. What is unexpected by current
theories, however, is that even with complete information, nuclear
weapons acquisition by a subordinate state can sometimes make a great
power more likely to intervene on the subordinate's behalf, transforming
a previously incredible defensive commitment into a credible one.
Therefore, some states may pursue nuclear weapons not only to provide
for their own security directly but also to enhance a great power's
commitment to their security. Further, a credible defensive commitment
cannot be made incredible through nuclear acquisition, meaning
proliferators need not fear that they will be abandoned after achieving
nuclear status. Proliferation decisions are not one-sided, but rather
depend upon a state's existing relationships and position in the
international system, and such decisions can in turn alter this
structure. Two assumptions underlie the model. First, all else equal,
great powers find the military defeat of their allies more costly if
those allies are nuclear armed, owing to the heightened security
concerns involved. Second, proliferation decisions are observable by
both a state's patron and its adversaries. Although states may in
practice begin to develop nuclear technology in secret, there is usually
some observable hint of this endeavor. In this discussion, the decision
to build nuclear weapons may be considered the moment this decision
becomes known by the relevant actors, whether through announcement or
discovery by another. Although nuclear programs can be, and have often
been, conducted in secrecy of varying degrees, I use complete
information in this game, for two reasons. First, I am interested in the
acquisition of nuclear weapons, rather than in the process of
acquisition. The issue at hand is what states can gain from possessing
nuclear weapons, and complete information helps avoid situations in
which nuclear programs are for show (i.e. in an attempt to extract
concessions or security assurances for ceasing pursuit).9 Allowing for
uncertainty over, for instance, whether a proliferator is truly pursuing
a weapon, or over its costs or ability to do so, might more exactly
describe the world, but at the cost of isolating the particular
mechanism in which I am interested. With complete information, there is
no ambiguity about a proliferator's intentions or abilities. Second,
using complete information shows that this mechanism exists even in the
absence of uncertainty. It is not driven by miscalculations, inaccurate
information, or mistaken beliefs. Even when great powers are completely
informed about their allies' actions and preferences, they may be pulled
into tighter commitments if they are unable to exert enough influence to
prevent proliferation. Adding incomplete information to this model would
change ranges of the parameters over which some equilibria exist, but it
would not fundamentally change the mechanism in which I am interested or
the reason the equilibria I discuss hold. Setup Consider a model with
three players: a non-nuclear Protégé (P), a Great Power defender (G),
and a potential Attacker (A). The model is set up with complete and
perfect information; all payoffs and actions are observable by all
players. Figure 1 shows the setup of the game. Figure 1. Game Tree To
begin, P decides to build or not build nuclear weapons, starting down
the path to proliferation (or not). If P chooses to build, G then
imposes a level of sanctions s.10 If P does not build, s is not
declared. Once P has made her building choice and G has made its
sanctions choice, A chooses to attack or not attack P. If A chooses not
attack, the game ends in either the original status quo (if P has not
chosen to build nuclear weapons) or a new state of affairs with another
nuclear actor on the scene (if P has chosen build). If A chooses to
attack, then G chooses to defend or abandon its protégé. If G defends,
there is a multilateral war in which P possesses or lacks nuclear
capability, depending on her proliferation decision. If G abandons,
there is a bilateral war, where P again possesses or lacks nuclear
weapons according to her decision. This means there is a war, modeled as
a costly lottery, at every node in which A has chosen to attack, after
which the game ends. P wins the costly lottery of war with probability ,
which is a function of her own military power , her defender's power ,
her attacker's power , and the level of sanctions s imposed on her.
Formally, where 11 The level of P's military capability increases with
nuclear acquisition, such that in the absence of nuclear weapons and in
their presence, where . The parameter takes a value of 1 if G comes to
's aid and 0 if not. Thus p takes four possible values according to P's
nuclear status and G's involvement in a war, which I abbreviate as:
(non-nuclear P alone), (non-nuclear P with G), (nuclear P alone), and
(nuclear P with G).Although s can represent assistance rather than
sanctioning, here I deal with the latter to represent non-proliferation
preferences. There is an upper bound, , representing the highest level
of sanctioning G is actually capable of imposing, as determined by the
extent of the subordinate state's autonomy, such that . P begins the
game in possession of some good or item, valued at 1, which A can
capture through war. This good may be tangible, such as a piece of
territory that can be physically captured, or it may be intangible, as
in a policy that may be overturned or a regime that may be overthrown.
Therefore 's value for the status quo is 1 and 's is 0. If P wins a war,
she keeps the item in dispute (1), while attacker A receives nothing
(0). Conversely, if A wins, he receives the disputed item (1), while P
receives nothing (0). 's value for the status quo is SQ; G receives no
share of the disputed good. Because war is costly, any state entering a
war incurs a cost for doing so, regardless of the outcome. If P chooses
to build nuclear weapons, she pays a proliferation cost v for the
process, capturing the time and resources necessary to develop such a
program. Meanwhile, if P loses a war, her patron G pays some cost k for
this loss. Under the assumption that great powers prefer losses by
non-nuclear subordinates to losses by nuclear subordinates, this cost is
higher when P has built nuclear weapons ( ) than when she has not ( ),
where .The payoff functions for each player are as follows: It is worth
noting here that, although this is not a bargaining model, in that the
setup does not allow for negotiations between A and P before a decision
to go to war is made, such a model would not be inconsistent with the
theory here. If A were allowed to make an offer, which P could accept
(ending in a peaceful settlement) or reject (ending in war), we would
not reach a war outcome with complete information. However, the size of
the maximum possible demand would still depend on the incentives of G,
whose decision-making calculus would remain unchanged. As long as G was
still not assumed to have a direct stake in the division of the good in
question, its costs of war and its thresholds between following a
reliable, unreliable, or entrapped strategy would be the same as in the
current setup, meaning the underlying mechanism of interest would hold.
Analysis I solve for the model's subgame perfect equilibria, and in
particular those in which a great power's commitment to an ally can be
altered through that ally's decisions. Specifically, this means that,
owing to the costs it would pay from a conflict, a great power would not
defend a non-nuclear subordinate in the event of an attack, but would
defend one armed with nuclear weapons. The potential defeat of a
nuclear-armed ally increases the patron's expected costs of war enough
that getting involved becomes the better option, in order to help
prevent this loss. Therefore, when a state (P) chooses not to build a
nuclear weapon, she does not have a great power's (G's) support if A
attacks, but when P chooses to build, she can also expect G to fight
along with her if attacked. In this instance, the great power's costs
for fighting fall into a range for which proliferation can make a
previously unreliable great power decide to defend its ally, and this
great power is considered "entrapped." More generally, there are three
strategies available to a great power defender, and its choice of
strategy is characterized by its costs for fighting on behalf of its
protégé. In the first strategy, above, the great power's commitment is
changeable and can be altered by its ally's proliferation; it will not
defend an ally armed only with conventional weapons, but it will defend
one armed with nuclear weapons. In the other two strategies the great
power's commitment decision is fixed. Some defenders are reliable, while
others are unreliable. A great power follows a "reliable" strategy when
its costs of fighting are sufficiently low that its defensive commitment
to a protégé is always credible, regardless of the latter's nuclear
status. The great power has no incentive to defect and abandon its
partner. Conversely, a great power follows an "unreliable" strategy when
its costs of fighting are high enough that it is never expected to come
to its protégé's defense, with or without the latter's nuclear
possession. The Supplemental Materials contain discussions of these two
strategies. My focus is on those equilibria where deterrence or defense
occurs---that is, where proliferation draws in a great power whose added
military capability helps deter an attack that would have otherwise been
launched, or where an attack occurs and a great power defends its
ally.12 In both instances, the act of proliferating provides a
substantive benefit that is a direct result of a great power's changed
incentives, as well as the standard deterrent or defensive boost that
results from possessing a nuclear weapon of one's own. They are
different benefits, but they stem from the same underlying mechanism of
rearranging a patron's incentives in an ally's favor. As such, both show
the potential for proliferation to change the structure of alignments in
the international system, binding great powers to their subordinates.
Changeable Commitments In this set of equilibria, G's decision to defend
or abandon its partner depends upon P's decision to build nuclear
weapons.13 This occurs when the great power's expected costs of war fall
into a middle range, entrapping it. The cost of a potential defeat by a
nuclear-armed P is great enough to sway G to her defense. The additional
motivation of drawing in a great power comes into play here; nuclear
weapons become attractive not only for their defensive military
potential, but also for their potential to increase the credibility of a
patron's defensive commitment. This results in a new dimension of
security concerns involved in proliferation decisions. In some instances
this strengthened security commitment will reinforce the deterrent
capacity of nuclear weapons. Proposition 1 summarizes the players'
strategies in this equilibrium. Proposition 1. When , and , P will build
nuclear weapons if . A will not attack if P builds nuclear weapons and
will attack if she does build them. G will defend if P builds nuclear
weapons and will not defend if she does not build.When A is deterrable,
such that his costs of war ( ) are low enough that he will attack in the
absence of nuclear weapons but high enough that he will not attack in
their presence, proliferation can not only deter an attack, but also
reinforces G's commitment. P will build when her ex ante probability of
winning a war is low enough, , where . Here, if the proliferator were
attacked, her patron would come to her defense, but in equilibrium this
is not observed because the attack is deterred by the presence of
nuclear weapons.The other interesting result in this set of equilibria
occurs when an adversary is undeterrable (A's cost of war is low enough
that he will attack, regardless of P's nuclear status) and a
proliferator builds a nuclear weapon, drawing her great power ally into
defending her when it would not have otherwise. This equilibrium is
shown in Proposition 2.Proposition 2. When , and , P will build nuclear
weapons if . A will attack whether or not P builds nuclear weapons. G
will defend if P builds nuclear weapons and will not defend if she does
not build. Here, a potential proliferator may again choose to build in
the face of an imminent threat, this time from an undeterrable
adversary. When her ex ante probability of winning alone against an
attacker is low ( , where ), proliferation increases her own military
capability, but also brings the added benefit of drawing her patron into
the fight on her behalf, further increasing her probability of victory.
The addition of G's military capability to this calculation also
increases the likelihood that the great power is unable to impose costly
enough sanctions to dissuade proliferation; to prevent nuclear pursuit,
such sanctions must now outweigh both the additional military boost of
nuclear weapons and the benefit of the great power's own military. The
equilibrium space appears in Figure 2. The Deterrence equilibrium
characterizes the area in which proliferation staves off an attack and
draws a great power ally closer, and the Defense equilibrium illustrates
the case when a great power that would not have otherwise defended its
ally does so as a direct consequence of the ally's nuclear acquisition.
These are the two areas in the equilibrium space where a patron's
incentives are changed through proliferation, causing it to defend an
ally that is attacked as part of its strategy where it would not
otherwise have done so. Figure 2. Equilibrium space in which the great
power\'s costs of war fall into the middle range, , such that it would
not defend a non-nuclear ally but would defend a nuclear ally.The
ability of the great power to set a level of sanctions high enough to
dissuade proliferation is crucial; a patron may be unable to prevent a
protégé from pursuing nuclear weapons, meaning it may be unable to
prevent that protégé from taking actions that change the patron's
incentives. Propositions 1 and 2 above hold when this is the case, such
that proliferation remains an option for P. In all cases, if G is unable
to impose sanctions at the threshold that can prevent P from acquiring a
weapon, then its strategy involves not imposing any sanctions (i.e.
setting ). If P will build regardless,14 then sanctions only serve to
lower her military capability when she does so. This decreases P's
probability of winning a war, thereby also directly decreasing G's own
expected utility. On the other hand, when G is able to set s above this
threshold, weakening P enough to actually decrease her probability of
victory and make pursuit unprofitable, G will do so, taking
proliferation off the table. In short, if G is unable to impose
sufficiently burdensome sanctions and shape its ally's proliferation
choice, P may be able to exploit this by altering G's incentives to come
to her defense through nuclear acquisition.

Patterns of proliferation

[The strategies of proliferating states show some broad
patterns]{.underline}. First, [in]{.underline} those [cases where an
adversary is undeterrable]{.underline}, we see the level of sanctions
imposed by a great power providing the binding constraint. When G's
commitment cannot be changed (it always follows either a reliable or
unreliable strategy), P will build when the sanctions imposed fall below
the threshold .15 However, when G's commitment can be made credible
through proliferation, P will build when the level of sanctions is below
the higher threshold. The difference between these two threshold values
( and ) is the added benefit of G's military power ( ), which can be
obtained through proliferation. When P is faced with an undeterrable
adversary and the potential to make G's commitment credible, [it is more
likely that the sanctions G is able to impose will fall below the
threshold at which P finds proliferation advantageous]{.underline}.

Second, [in cases where A will be deterred by P's nuclear
possession,]{.underline} [P's decision is predicated directly upon her
ex ante probability of victory in a conflict]{.underline}. [When she
knows A will not attack if she builds nuclear weapons, she will build
only if her probability of victory without them is low
enough]{.underline}. When G's strategy is reliable, this condition is
met when her chance of winning with the help of her ally is low ( ).
When G's strategy is unreliable, P's chances of winning alone ( ) must
be below this threshold. [As]{.underline} , [this constraint is easier
to meet]{.underline}, and proliferation is more attractive. However,
when G's commitment can be made credible through proliferation, it is
again this lower constraint that binds. When [proliferation can **draw a
great power ally closer**]{.underline}, a state is also more likely to
build nuclear weapons when faced with a deterrable adversary than she is
when her patron is always reliable.

The cases in which A is undeterrable, however, are defined in part by
the level of sanctions imposed, as the level of costs of war below which
he will always attack is (or with G's aid). [Because]{.underline} and
are in , higher levels of sanctions that weaken P's ability to fight
increase this critical value, making it more likely that A's costs will
be low enough to attack regardless of P's decision. Therefore, below the
threshold at which they deter proliferation, great power sanctions may
increase the external threat faced by their partners. Similarly, as
increasing the level of sanctions imposed ( ) increases the threshold
for A's costs of war ( ) below which A will attack, but does not factor
into P's ex ante probability of victory ( ), increasing sanctions also
decreases the range of values within which A can be deterred through
proliferation. It becomes easier for an adversary's costs of war to be
low enough that he will always attack without affecting the value above
which he will not.

Theory in practice

[The cases of South Africa and Israel as states that acquired nuclear
weapons over US objections provide illustrative examples of the logic
laid out in the formal model]{.underline}. In each,
[leaders]{.underline} and military decision-makers [saw the potential
for nuclear capability to increase US commitments to ensure their
survival in the event of attack]{.underline}. These may be contrasted
with other instances of (attempted) proliferation where the values of
the relevant parameters fell outside the ranges in which the potential
to draw a great power closer would have emerged; in France we see a case
where the costs to the US would have been too high to draw it in, while
in South Korea we see a case where the US's ability to impose sanctions
was high enough to thwart nuclear ambitions.

South Africa

South Africa gives us the clearest example of this line of thinking at
play during the nuclear weapons development process. As a state without
a great power defensive commitment, South Africa differs from others in
two important ways. First, the absence of a great power commitment was
associated with a lack of great power influence, and so the ability of
any state (including the US) to impose costly enough sanctions to deter
proliferation was also absent. The Special Project Division at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in the US noted in a 1980 assessment that
"\[u\]nlike other current pariahs, [**South Africa** has **no patron**
with any commitment towards the maintenance of a regional military
balance, a situation in which the absence of arms self-sufficiency is
especially worrisome]{.underline}" (Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory 1980: 10). [[South Africa's independent **development of a
small nuclear arsenal**]{.mark} during the 1970s and 1980s [was]{.mark}
probably [facilitated by its position outside the **sphere of
influence** of]{.mark} either [the **US**]{.mark} or
**USSR**]{.underline}.16 With neither superpower in a position to
adversely affect its military strength, nor committed to its survival,
South Africa's decision to pursue a nuclear program was tempered only by
the cost of proliferating itself.

Second, [because a great power commitment was completely
absent]{.underline}, [the potential to create one existed]{.underline}.
In a strategy termed "**[[catalytic deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
Reiss (1995) [[describes South Africa's]{.mark} nuclear
[strategy]{.mark} as consisting of three phases]{.underline}:

Strategic uncertainty characterized phase 1: [the government would
neither confirm nor deny whether it possessed a nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}. If the country was threatened militarily, phase
2 required that [South Africa would quietly reveal its nuclear
capability to leading Western governments]{.underline}, principally the
US. This phase of the strategy aimed to provoke Washington, which would
be so disturbed at the potential use of nuclear weapons in the region,
and so sensitive to the implications for its global nonproliferation
agenda, that it would intervene on South Africa's behalf before the
country was overrun ... As a last resort, South Africa would reveal its
nuclear arsenal. (p. 15)

Put succinctly, [South Africa's nuclear plan was "[to elicit U.S.
security assistance in the event of a crisis]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Debs
and Monteiro 2016: 270). Although never reaching the point of use in
this way, this [provides clear evidence that the potential to draw in US
assistance that otherwise might not be forthcoming in the event of
military attack was a driving force in South Africa's nuclear
development]{.underline}. Goodson (2012) notes that this strategy may be
a new option for proliferators. The country's proliferation has been
described as driven by its "perception of an intense security threat,
coupled with international isolation" (Debs and Monteiro 2016: 271). I
do not disagree with this characterization, but it does not account for
South Africa's particular intended use of its nuclear weapons. Why would
South Africa build weapons it, by many accounts, did not intend to
deploy? My model fills in a missing piece of this puzzle, suggesting
that South Africa's calculations were not unreasonable.

Israel

Cohen (2008) argues that the absence of a great power alliance combined
with the existential fear generated by its creation in the aftermath of
the Holocaust sparked the beginning of Israel's nuclear program under
Ben-Gurion[. Given **[Israel]{.mark}**'s size and location]{.underline},
the acquisition of nuclear weapons not only provided a significant boost
to its defensive military capabilities, but it also [[**drew the US**
into a closer relationship in which the possibility of a nuclear
Israel's defeat became unacceptably costly]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
Israel, it does not appear to be the case that securing US support was a
driving factor in the development of their nuclear arsenal, but it does
seem that Israel's leaders attempted to capitalize on this effect.

Debs and Monteiro (2016: 232) claim that "the United States need not
fear entrapment resulting from a putative preventive strike against
Israel's nuclear program." This focus, however, is specifically on a
preventive strike on the nuclear program itself, rather than a strike on
an Israel armed with a functional nuclear arsenal. Here we differ, as I
argue that it was not during the development process that the US
commitment could be strengthened, but rather in the aftermath.

Goodson (2012: 209) similarly suggests that the example of South Africa
may be relevant in the future for "similar opaque arsenals," such as
Israel, and the possible ends to which they might be used. This
possibility becomes even more distinct when one considers that there is
evidence suggesting this has already been considered. Following the
opening strike of the 1973 Yom Kippur War on Israel by Egypt and Syria,
Hersh (1991: 225) describes a scene in which the Israeli leadership
resolved to arm and target its nuclear weapons, then inform the US of
this action in order to force an emergency military resupply. The first
plan for the nuclear weapons was not to deploy them, but to use them to
provoke US military assistance. In line with my theory, this was part of
what was termed the "Samson Option," in which Israel would use its
nuclear weapons as a last resort in the event of overwhelming attack,
thereby bringing their enemies down with them as the biblical Samson did
with the Philistines (Hersh 1991: 137).

In and of itself, the Samson Option suggests that, unlike South Africa,
Israel's nuclear arsenal was created in part for directly defensive
purposes. Where South Africa does not seem to have really considered
using its own nuclear weapons a viable strategy, similar evidence to
suggest Israel's weapons exist solely for the purposes of nuclear
blackmail is lacking. However, the decision to inform the US that it was
actively preparing for the Samson Option strongly indicates that Israel
was not unaware of the interests the US had in the Middle East and
believed the superpower might step in to prevent nuclear war from
beginning in the region.

[There is also evidence that the US response was considered early in the
process]{.underline}. Hersh (1991) discusses a recollection by Bertrand
Goldschmidt, of France's Atomic Energy Commission, regarding a 1956
meeting on Israel's appeal for French help with building a heavy-water
reactor. According to Bertrand, "They \[Shimon Peres and Ernst
Bergmann\] said that when the Americans will realize we have a nuclear
capacity, they will give us the guarantee of survival. All of this was
decided before the Suez affair" (quoted in Hersh 1991: 39). Hersh also
reports a discussion with Francis Perrin, the High-Commissioner of the
French Atomic Energy Commission, regarding a dinner with the Israeli
delegation shortly after the meeting with Bertrand. As Perrin recalled,
"[We thought the Israeli bomb was aimed against the Americans ... Not to
launch it against America but to say, 'If you don't want to help us in a
critical situation we will require you to help us. Otherwise we will use
our nuclear bombs]{.underline}"' (quoted in Hersh 1991: 40).

Scope of the mechanism

To more clearly understand where we should expect to see this new
mechanism at work, it is helpful to identify its scope. [**[A great
power can only be drawn into a tighter commitment]{.mark}** against its
will [when]{.mark}]{.underline} (1) [its [costs]{.mark} for entering a
conflict to defend an ally [are neither too high nor too
low]{.mark}]{.underline}, falling into a middle ground [where [it will
pursue]{.mark}]{.underline} an "entrapped" strategy (**[[defending a
nuclear ally but not a non-nuclear one]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
[and]{.underline} (2[)]{.underline} [it lacks sufficient leverage over a
potential proliferator to dissuade a nuclear program]{.underline}
through military or economic sanctions. When values for either or both
of these parameters (the costs of war and the ability to impose
sanctions) fall outside the ranges defined above, states pursue
different strategies and so wind up in different equilibria. Such cases
are covered by the model and are fully consistent with the theory, but
in some of them the new mechanism of binding a great power more tightly
is not at play, and in others it is not directly observed in the outcome
but remains relevant for explaining what is observed. France provides an
example of a case where the US costs of war were high and its ability to
deter via sanctions was low; South Korea gives us but one of many
instances where the US ability to use sanctions to impose its will was
sufficiently high.

\[Pause paragraph breaks\]

When a great power's costs of war are high enough, even a successful
proliferation attempt should not be expected to compel it to defend
another.17 The cost to the US of coming to France's defense was high
enough to put it outside the range in which France could have made a
significant impact on US decision-making. Put another way, France could
not expect to rearrange US preferences via nuclear acquisition; the
potential cost to the US for defending France would probably involve a
direct confrontation with a nuclear-armed USSR and would be unacceptably
high, making a credible commitment to France's security difficult to say
the least. As such, the US could be expected to follow an "unreliable"
strategy, failing to come to its ally's defense with or without a French
nuclear arsenal.18 As the US had neither the ability to make its
commitment to France credible owing to its own high costs for defense
nor the leverage to compel France to cease its program via sanctions,
the case falls within an equilibrium in which acquiring a nuclear weapon
has only a direct deterrent or defensive application, without invoking
the additional, indirect benefits of drawing a great power closer. Such
cases do not fall within the range of parameters where we should expect
to see this new mechanism at play, but they do fall squarely within the
broader theoretical framework in which the new mechanism exists.
Although cases in which the second criterion (high sanctioning ability)
is not met ultimately do not result in nuclear weapons acquisition, and
as such might be considered outside the scope of interest of this paper,
they are worth mentioning for two reasons. One is to underscore the fact
that they are also consistent with the model; the ability of a great
power to pressure another state into abandoning a nuclear program via
some form of sanctions results in one of the "Status Quo" equilibria
that emerge. The second, more theoretically interesting reason to
consider them is that they may nevertheless be driven by this mechanism
of entrapping great powers, even when it is not directly observed in the
outcome. Great powers who look ahead and anticipate that they may become
entrapped by an ally's nuclear acquisition in the future may have
greater incentives to pressure that ally in the present, in order to
avoid the realization of this outcome. That is, the existence of this
possibility off the equilibrium path may in some cases help support
nonproliferation on the "Status Quo" path.19,20 Because this mechanism
of drawing great powers closer revolves around great powers' preferences
(and the ability to change them), we should keep in mind that these
preferences are as critical in determining great powers' strategies as
those of their allies. This mechanism can help explain what some states
hope to get from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and it can also help
explain why great powers might prefer to prevent that acquisition.21 To
see an example of when the second criterion is not met, we can look to
the case of South Korea, where the amount of pressure the US could bring
to bear was within the threshold required to halt the South Korean
nuclear program. Whether the US costs for defending the peninsula were
in the upper range (in which it would be expected to follow an
"unreliable" strategy and fail to defend its ally) or in the middle
range (where it should follow a "changeable" strategy and defend a
nuclear, but not a non-nuclear, ally), it could, and did, prevent the
program from reaching that point by threatening to withdraw its troops.
In the model's terms, the upper bound of sanctions that the US could
impose was sufficiently high to make proliferation costly enough for
South Korea to abandon its pursuit. The South Korean proliferation
attempt therefore falls within one of the model's "Status Quo"
equilibria. A close examination of the historical record surrounding the
US response to South Korean proliferation attempts might reveal which
equilibrium was expected to emerge in the event that a nuclear
capability was acquired (i.e. whether the US would have defended a
nuclear-armed South Korea where it was expected to abandon a non-nuclear
one, or whether the US commitment was sufficiently low that it would
have abandoned its ally regardless), but in either case the US ability
to exert pressure to halt the program proved sufficient to do so.
Conclusions The relationship between nuclear proliferation and the
reliability of great (nuclear) powers as defensive allies is
multifaceted. The hierarchy between two states suggests that the
anticipated response of a dominant power can dictate when a subordinate
will choose to engage in nuclear pursuit, and those states able to
withstand the cost of proliferation can sometimes use this to bind great
powers more firmly to their defense. States with a fear of abandonment
in the face of an external threat have a greater incentive to pursue
nuclear weapons than others, and the level of great power influence
becomes a critical factor in determining their ability to acquire them.
Those that are secure in their defense, however, may find nuclear
weapons acquisition an unnecessary and costly venture, disinclining them
to undertake such pursuit unless they can acquire these weapons very
cheaply or find that their effect on battlefield outcomes when faced
with an undeterrable adversary will be quite large. This may be the case
when states are engaged in enduring rivalries where their existence is
threatened, for instance, allowing for what could be perceived as a
legitimate use of the nuclear option. Together, the fear of abandonment
in the face of an external threat and the level of great power
influence, either direct or indirect, over the military power of a
subordinate state in its hierarchy help illuminate some of the
proliferation choices that states make.

### Taiwan War Now

#### Expert consensus agrees China is more prepared than ever to invade Taiwan.

[[**Tensions** in the Taiwan Strait are
**growing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even before Taiwan elected William Lai
as its president, in January 2024, China voiced strong opposition to
him, calling him a "separatist" and an "instigator of war." In recent
months, [[Beijing]{.mark} has **[ramped up]{.mark}** its
[broadsides]{.mark}]{.underline}: in mid-March, the spokesperson for
China's Taiwan Affairs Office labeled Lai a "destroyer of cross-Straits
peace" and accused him of pushing Taiwan toward "the perilous brink of
war." Two weeks later, [[as]{.mark} [**Beijing** launched a
large-**scale military exercise** around Taiwan]{.mark}, the People's
Liberation Army (**PLA**) circulated cartoon images that portrayed Lai
as an insect]{.underline}. One image depicted a pair of chopsticks
picking the "parasite" Lai out of a burning Taiwan.

This effort to dehumanize Lai reflects Beijing's deep anxiety about the
trajectory of cross-strait relations, particularly what China views as
Lai's desire to push Taiwan toward independence. Compared with his
predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen, Lai has taken a stronger and more defiant
stance in the face of growing Chinese threats to the island, as evident
in his rhetoric and new policy measures. This March, Lai characterized
Beijing as a "hostile foreign force" and announced a plan to implement
17 wide-ranging strategies to defend the island from Chinese
infiltration.

China's vilification of Lai echoes Beijing's denunciations, roughly two
decades ago, of Chen Shui-bian, then president of Taiwan. Beijing
labeled Chen a "die-hard separatist" and "a troublemaker" who "is riding
near the edge of the cliff, and there is no sign that he is going to
rein in his horse." Beijing escalated external pressure against Chen and
worked with opposition parties within Taiwan to frustrate his political
agenda. China did come dangerously close to using military force against
the island in 2008 and might have gone through with it if Chen had been
more successful in winning Taiwan's public support for his referendum.

[[Beijing's attitude]{.mark} now **[should]{.mark} very much [concern
Washington]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China does not view Lai's rule as
merely a continuation of that of Tsai. Instead, [Beijing sees Lai as a
disruptor like Chen and is treating him much in the same
way]{.underline}. Since Lai became president, [Beijing has [demonstrated
**growing willingness** to use **military might**]{.mark} to intimidate
and punish the island]{.underline}. [[And]{.mark} it [is]{.mark} far
more **pre[pared]{.mark}** [to use force]{.mark} against Taiwan
**[today]{.mark}** than it was 20 years ago]{.underline}.

Apparent divisions within U.S. President Donald Trump's administration
about how to approach Taiwan compound these risks. If Beijing doubts
U.S. commitments to the island, that could encourage China to engage in
more coercive actions against Taiwan. All these factors dramatically
increase the chances that Beijing will miscalculate---and that it could
very well use force against the island around 2027, as China approaches
critical military modernization milestones and Taiwan gears up for its
next presidential election.

ESCALATION SPIRAL

[[China's **official narratives**]{.mark} have long [emphasize]{.mark}d
that its peaceful **[unification]{.mark}** with Taiwan [is
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in recent months, [anxiety has
mounted in Beijing that Lai intends to systematically decouple Taiwan
from China]{.underline}. [Chinese media outlets]{.underline} have
accused Lai of militarizing Taiwanese society as Lai prioritized efforts
to increase Taiwan's defensive resilience, reinstated the military court
system to handle espionage and treason by Taiwan military officials, and
[accelerated training and preparations for the possibility of a Chinese
invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}. Beijing is highly critical of Lai's
efforts to thwart Chinese infiltration and to counter Chinese cognitive
warfare, arguing that Lai is preventing the resumption of tourism,
suppressing and prosecuting pro-Chinese groups and individuals,
discouraging Taiwanese citizens from applying for Chinese identification
documents, imposing barriers on academic collaboration between
universities in China and Taiwan, and altering Taiwan's textbooks to
undermine historical and cultural affinity.

In March, a Chinese government spokesperson claimed that Lai's 17
strategies were aimed at "obstructing exchanges and cooperation across
the Taiwan Strait." China has also denounced Lai's efforts to encourage
Taiwanese businesses to invest more in democratic countries, including
in the United States. Beijing has cast these measures as doomed to fail
and mocked Taipei when the United States threatened to impose high
tariffs on the island in April.

Many Chinese analysts believe that Lai's political position is weak
compared with that of his predecessor, Tsai. But they worry that this
weakness may make Lai bolder, as he might want to ramp up confrontation
with China to try to win public support.

Based on this analysis of Lai and domestic conditions in Taiwan, hawkish
voices within China are urging an ever more aggressive approach toward
Taiwan. Some are calling for the use of military force against the
island or the resurrection of so-called civil war operations,
nonpeaceful ways for Beijing to unify with the island, such as by
imposing a maritime blockade of the island. Other hawks have publicly
wondered whether Beijing can engineer a crisis in Taipei similar to the
1936 Xian incident, in which generals serving under Chiang
Kai-shek---who was leading the government of the Republic of China and
its Nationalist forces---seized Chiang and forced him to ally with the
Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japanese forces that had
invaded northern China.

[[The **pace** and **scale** of Chinese **military activities** are
increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A more resonant parallel may be to one of the most dangerous periods
during Chen's tenure. To boost turnout in Taiwan's March 2008
presidential election, Chen paired that vote with a popular referendum
on whether the island should join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan instead of the Republic of China.

This proposal came perilously close to crossing a redline for Beijing:
in 2005, Beijing had passed the Anti-Secession Law, which established
China's right to use military force against Taiwan under several
conditions, including if "major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession
from China should occur." When the law was passed, a spokesperson for
the Chinese government suggested that an island-wide referendum could be
considered a major incident. And in 2007, after Chen proposed the
referendum, Chinese President Hu Jintao warned U.S. President George W.
Bush that Beijing interpreted the Taiwan referendum in this way.

[Beijing accompanied these warnings with significant military
signaling]{.underline}. [China increased its deployment of short-range
ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan sevenfold from the beginning of
Chen's term in 2000 to early 2008]{.underline}. Before the referendum,
the Bush administration detected that the PLA had put mobile short-range
missile units near the Taiwan Strait on heightened alert. The U.S.
military and intelligence community believed that China could fire
missiles around Taiwan, as it had during the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis---or, worse, China could actually attack the island.

Fortunately, the 2008 crisis passed without bloodshed. Low voter turnout
invalidated Chen's referendum, and the opposition Kuomintang candidate
beat the candidate from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party in the
presidential race. U.S. deployment of significant forces near Taiwan may
also have given Beijing pause. Taking the risk of escalation seriously,
Washington had publicly opposed Chen's referendum and positioned two
aircraft carriers to the northeast and southeast of Taiwan, and a third
near Singapore, ahead of the vote. Nevertheless, [the episode suggested
that Beijing was serious about using force if provoked by what it viewed
as "pro-independence" activities]{.underline}.

BAD OMENS

[Since the 2008 crisis, China's military capabilities have grown
significantly]{.underline}. [Its army, navy, and air force have rapidly
modernized, and its conventional rocket forces now field a far more
capable array of longer-range missiles, including advanced hypersonic
and antiship ballistic missiles]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} has
also [doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past five
years]{.underline}. Beyond advances in hard capabilities, Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping has [launched sweeping organizational
reforms to enable the PLA to conduct more joint high-tech
operations]{.underline}, and he has waged unparalleled anticorruption
campaigns to root out obstacles to military readiness.

[Beijing's willingness to use its military is growing]{.underline}, too.
China has long engaged in military exercises to hone its capabilities
and intimidate Taiwan. During Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou's tenure
from 2008 to 2016, Beijing limited these provocations as it sought to
encourage greater cross-Strait engagement. But China resumed major
exercises when Tsai, who emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty and security,
succeeded Ma. In August 2022, toward the end of Tsai's term, China
mounted larger and more provocative drills near Taiwan than it had ever
held before.

Now the pace and scale of Chinese military activities are increasing.
Not even a year into Lai's term, [[China has **broken precedent** by
staging three large-scale exercises, which were given names to]{.mark}
raise their profile and [**distinguish** them from smaller
drills]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In a significant shift, the PLA is now using such large-scale military
exercises to punish Lai's administration for domestic political acts.
All of China's past major exercises---in 1995--96, 2022, and 2023---were
launched after Taiwan's leaders traveled to the United States or met
with senior U.S. officials. Last December, China did engage in a
major---but unnamed---drill after Lai made stops in Hawaii and Guam on a
tour of the Pacific. But all three recent large-scale exercises
responded to domestic speeches or statements by Lai.

[These military activities have become markedly more provocative,
unpredictable, and complex]{.underline}. In April's exercise, named
Strait Thunder-2025A, PLA naval vessels reportedly ventured within 24
nautical miles of the island's shores. [China is engaging in large-scale
operations around Taiwan year round and increasing activities to the
east of Taiwan]{.underline}. In a break with the past, [[the PLA now
provides little or no advance warning of its
drills]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has raised concerns in Washington and
Taipei about how much lead time the United States and Taiwan might have
should China decide to use force to seize the island.

Washington must ensure that China clearly understands the resolve of the
United States.

In another shift from earlier years, recent rounds of exercises have
witnessed China's coast guard joining with the navy to practice
blockading Taiwan. China's maritime militia, a state-backed network of
civilian vessels often deployed to assert Chinese territorial claims,
has also become increasingly involved. The participation of these new
actors suggests that China is preparing to conduct a broad variety of
operations, such as an invasion, a PLA navy--led blockade, and a Chinese
coast guard--led quarantine of Taiwan.

Finally, China is also operating across a bigger geographic range: its
exercise in December involved one of the largest-ever deployments of
maritime forces from all three of the PLA's coastal commands. China
conducted operations around Taiwan and in the East China and South China
Seas, demonstrating its ability to dominate areas within the first
island chain---an arc of islands and countries in the Western Pacific
stretching from Japan to parts of Indonesia---and block external forces
from entering to assist Taiwan.

Apart from such major operations, [China now conducts near-daily
military incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone, a
self-declared area that extends beyond the island's official
airspace]{.underline}. In 2024, [the Chinese military flew a
record-shattering 3,075 sorties into this zone, an increase of over 80
percent from 2023]{.underline}. These [operations aim to delegitimize
Taiwan's claims to its surrounding air and seas and complicate Taiwan's
ability to monitor and track activities around the island]{.underline}.

Some of these air incursions occur as part of "joint combat readiness
patrols," involving not just air assets but also coordinated maritime
operations. These patrols are now occurring on a near-weekly basis and
offer China opportunities to quickly step up coercion against Taiwan
short of much larger-scale exercises. Days after Lai unveiled his 17
strategies in March, for instance, China launched two joint combat
readiness patrols and then followed up two weeks later by holding its
Strait Thunder-2025A exercise.

WILD CARD

U.S. officials are issuing warnings about these remarkable Chinese
military activities. In February, [Samuel Paparo]{.underline}, th[e head
of the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command]{.underline},
[asserted]{.underline} that China's "[[**aggressive maneuvers** around
Taiwan right now are **not exercises**]{.mark}. . . .[They are
**rehearsals**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Yet as China increases its military activities against Taiwan, many in
Beijing don't know where Washington stands. Beijing is relatively
confident that the Trump administration wants to intensify competition
with China, with a particular focus on the economic relationship.
Chinese analysts also generally believe that Trump will try to use
Taiwan as a card in this competition, but there is no consensus on how
he will do so.

Chinese experts assess that Trump and his team are divided on Taiwan.
Many believe that Trump wants to negotiate deals with China and that he
and many of his supporters want to avoid foreign military entanglements.
But national security hawks in the administration, such as Secretary of
State Marco Rubio, are still focused on checking Chinese aggression and
influence. Chinese interlocutors note that Trump's national security
team is not receptive to Chinese concerns about Lai, and they worry that
when it comes to day-to-day Taiwan policy, this administration will
likely strengthen relations with Taipei through deepened cooperation and
increased arms sales.

The lead article in the July/August 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs is
titled "Why Iran Should Get the Bomb." The author, [Kenneth
**Waltz**]{.underline}, a former president of the American Political
Science Association, [argues]{.underline} that the world should stop
worrying about Iran getting the bomb. He sums up his basic argument this
way: "If Iran goes nuclear, Israel and Iran will deter each other, as
nuclear powers always have. [There has never been a full-scale war
between two nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. [Once Iran crosses the
nuclear threshold, deterrence will apply, even if the Iranian arsenal is
relatively small]{.underline}."

In essence, [[Waltz puts his faith in **nuclear deterrence**]{.mark} and
justifies this in historical terms]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} the
[**history** is short and there have been]{.mark} many **[close
calls]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During the 67-year period since the dawn
of the Nuclear Age [there have been numerous **accidents**]{.underline},
[[**miscalculations** and **threats** to use nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Fifty years ago, the US and Soviet Union
stood at the precipice of nuclear war during the **Cuban Missile
Crisis**]{.underline}. [[Waltz's faith]{.mark} in nuclear deterrence
[reflects]{.mark} a [belief in **rationality**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
belief that all leaders will behave rationally at all times, including
under conditions of extreme stress. [[This defies]{.mark} our
[understanding of **human behavior**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
ever-present potential for human **[fallibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Another way to view the historical data from which Waltz finds comfort
is by an analogy of a man jumping off a hundred-story building. As he
passes floor after floor, he wonders why people on the ground are
showing concern for his well-being. He ignores the approaching ground
and focuses his attention on the fact that nothing bad has happened to
him yet. [[In]{.mark} Waltz's theory of **[nuclear deterrence]{.mark}**,
[there is no hard ground below, nor gravity acting]{.mark} upon the
jumper]{.underline}. He argues that "history has shown that where
nuclear capabilities emerge, so, too, does stability. When it comes to
nuclear weapons, now as ever, more may be better." While [[having
more]{.underline}]{.mark} may be better, it [[may also be **far
worse**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Martin Hellman, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at
Stanford University and an expert in risk analysis, argues that a child
born today has a ten percent or greater chance of having his or her life
cut short by nuclear war. Unlike Waltz's analysis, [**risk analysis**
takes into account the odds of an event occurring and doesn't base its
analysis of the future simply on what the historical record shows at a
given point in time]{.underline}. [Ten coin flips may produce ten
straight "heads," but it would be **unwise** to **assume** that the
results between heads and tails would not even out over
time]{.underline}. [[With nuclear weapons, the consequences of being
wrong in one's projections are]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, far
[**[more dire]{.mark}** than with coin tosses]{.underline}.

Another analogy that has been used to describe the standoff between
nuclear-armed powers, particularly the US and Soviet Union during the
Cold War, was of two men standing up to their waists in the same pool of
gasoline and each man being ready to strike an unlit match. If either
man struck the match, both men would be consumed by the fire that would
result. With nuclear weapons, the conflagration would not stop at the
two men -- it would include their families, their communities, their
countries and the world.

[[Waltz makes the bet that no leader]{.mark} of a nuclear weapon state
[will ever]{.mark} strike the match or [allow the]{.mark} match to fall
into hands that will [strike]{.mark} it]{.underline}. [[It
is]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[foolish]{.underline}]{.mark}** bet to
make. The two men, and the rest of us, would be far safer if the
gasoline were drained from the pool. In the same way, the world would be
much safer if nuclear weapons were abolished, rather than shared in the
hope they would enhance security in the Middle East or elsewhere.

[Waltz may believe that it is precisely the threat of conflagration that
keeps the men from striking the matches]{.underline}. For many, even
most, men he may be correct, but the fact is that [neither Waltz
**[no]{.mark}**r any**[one]{.mark}** else [can **predict human
behavior** under **all conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There may be
some leaders in some circumstances for whom striking the match would
seem rational. In addition, even if neither man were to strike a match,
lightning may strike the pool of gasoline or other sparks may ignite the
pool from unforeseen causes. Instances of accidents, madness and human
fallibility abound.

[[**Nuclear weapons** have brought humankind to the
**precipice**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These weapons
**threaten**]{.underline} cities, countries, civilization and [**complex
life** on the planet]{.underline}. It is the responsibility of those of
us alive on the planet now to abolish these weapons of mass
annihilation, not justify their spread, as Waltz would have us do.

#### Proliferation optimism is flawed\-\--it reproduces conservatism and pessimism.

Employing conservatism and its admonitions as a lens through which to
view neorealism helps to answer our question, since indicating how
neorealism resembles conservatism indicates how neorealism retains a
pessimistic view of human nature. This illuminates the way proliferation
optimism reproduces proliferation pessimism and, by associating
neorealism and pessimism, reconciles the division within Shimko's
argument while it hinders the post-Cold War effort to recharacterize
neorealism as liberalism. The claim is that [**conservative
reservations** about the spread of nuclear weapons evince an unheralded
but clearly **pessimistic view** of **human nature** operating within
**neorealist proliferation optimism**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
unrecognized [belief]{.underline} ultimately [prevents optimism from
embracing unqualified nuclear proliferation]{.underline}---despite the
presence of its like-units, rational fear, same conditions, nuclear
clarity and market (survival) imperatives---[and so reveals 'optimism'
to be an essentially empty dimension of neorealism]{.underline}. This
claim does not join the chorus of scholarship that says optimism uses
unrealistic assumptions and is thus unsound.99 It maintains that working
[optimism **reproduces unintentionally** what it seeks to eliminate:
proliferation pessimism]{.underline}. The presence and influence of
imperfect human nature (rather than its posited irrelevance within
structural analysis) compels neorealism as optimism to reproduce
proliferation pessimism via conservative reservations regarding the
unqualified spread of nuclear weapons.100

[Optimism resembles conservatism in several ways]{.underline}. First,
[its rendition of a proliferated world approximates **conservatism's
good society**]{.underline}. Current nuclear-weapon states are its
experienced leaders, [**deterrence** is its main enduring institution
and all other states are the ordinary actors to which the power to rule
may be delegated]{.underline}. [Stability typifies this good society for
several reasons: current nuclear-weapon states are examples for
**ordinary states** to **imitate**, rejecting their history only invites
**disaster**]{.underline}. 101 Current conditions remain the same as
previous conditions, meaning non-nuclear states may regard the
experiences of the current nuclear states as lessons and thereby achieve
the same stability. As a prescriptive institution, [strategic deterrence
is an accessible archive of organic injunctions and past
achievements]{.underline} (for example, prejudices, humanity's 'second
nature') [that]{.underline}: [induces and is renewed by right
behaviour]{.underline} (revives extended deterrence); denies the need
for inquiry into its practical origins (persistence begets
naturalization)102 ; [and]{.underline}, [absolves current leaders of the
on-going need to legitimize either their inherited
privileges]{.underline} (say, permanent security council seats) and
property (nuclear arms) or their social duties (say, retaliation).
[Nucleonics is an encompassing]{.underline}, [**quasi-religious
authority** which compels universal submission]{.underline}. When change
does occur, nuclear weapons render novel multipolar arrangements akin to
enduring, traditional bipolar ones. The main threat to this good society
is an idea that inverts the natural order of things: just as the
Revolution instructs humans to not do what they must, namely submit, the
nonproliferation movement tells states to not do what they must, that
is, acquire what they need to survive.103 And last, among others,
instinct as fear overrules abstract, contrived designs, and is
ultimately what precludes nuclear use. Mannheim observes: 'The
peculiarity of the conservative way of putting things into a wider
context is that it approaches them in some way from behind, from their
past\... . The conservative \... sees all the significance of a thing in
what lies behind it\... . Where the \[liberal\] progressive uses the
future \[utopia\] to interpret things, the conservative uses the past.'
104 Alone, leadership and institutions allow optimism to pronounce that
with proliferation the potentially unruly present assumes the shape of
the quiescent past. As Waltz intones: 'In a nuclear world, conservative
would-be attackers will be prudent'.105

Contemporary optimism resembles conservatism in a second and more
surprising way, given its origins in microeconomic theory. It regards
actors as unequal in their capacity to rule, where rule is the
possession of nuclear weapons. Optimism cautions that while some states
are qualified, many more states are unqualified and so must be denied
nuclear weapons. It implicitly casts such states as somehow immune to
the universal constraining elements neorealism promotes, while being
driven by a will to power or just doomed by their internal inadequacies.
While unheralded in the literature, this general reservation about the
spread of nuclear weapons to unfit states recurs in each wave of
optimism. In 1959, for instance, Knorr acknowledges it is: 'Very likely
the possession of nuclear arms will have a chastening effect on the
leaders of those states instead of encouraging them to rash actions \...
\[but\] the very idea of atomic bombs at the disposal of, say, Egypt or
Israel conjures up a nightmare in American minds.' 106 And in 1962,
Wildavsky embraces proliferation since:

[A policy of spreading nuclear weapons]{.underline} presents the
possibility of defense against nuclear blackmail \... \[But\] Obviously,
possession of atomic weapons [should not be encouraged]{.underline} in
nations which are unstable, trigger-happy, in the mood for vendettas, or
what have you. [Many nations]{.underline} \... [are **not good
candidates**]{.underline} \... other nations---Sweden, Switzerland,
Australia, Canada, and Turkey are a few that come to mind---should be
encouraged to acquire nuclear weapons if they wish to do so.107

'[If there is one area in the world where the big powers have an
obligation to block the introduction of nuclear arms, it is certainly
the Middle East]{.underline} \... \[similarly\] [China's acquisition of
an atomic force will probably lead to consequences that are distinctly
unpleasant to contemplate]{.underline}.'108 'Thus we have an example of
the possibility of stabilizing the present world political system in
part by the discrete diffusion of atomic arms,' Wentz writes
optimistically. Yet, 'This does not imply the [offering of nuclear
weapons to all takers]{.underline}. Such a policy [would]{.underline}
clearly [**deteriorate** American **security'**]{.underline}.109 Similar
conservative reservations appear in the latest waves of optimism, as
well.110 As a prominent structural realist and optimist, Mearsheimer
counsels in 1990 that Germany alone, among non-nuclear European states,
is qualified to receive nuclear arms. He explains:

The most likely scenario in the wake of the Cold War is [further nuclear
proliferation in Europe]{.underline}\... . Mismanaged proliferation
[could]{.underline} produce d[isaster]{.underline}, while well-managed
proliferation could produce an order nearly as stable as the current
order. Unfortunately, however, [**any proliferation** is likely to be
**mismanaged**]{.underline} \... [a stable nuclear competition might not
emerge between the new nuclear states]{.underline} \... [elites and
publics of]{.underline} the [emerging nuclear European states might
not]{.underline} quickly develop doctrines and attitudes that reflect a
[grasp of the **devastating consequences** and]{.underline} basic
[unwinnability of nuclear war]{.underline} \... widespread
[prolif]{.underline}eration [would increase the number of fingers on the
nuclear trigger]{.underline}, [which in turn would increase the
likelihood that nuclear weapons could be fired due to **accident**,
**unauthorized use**]{.underline} \... [or **irrational
decision-making**]{.underline}\... . It would be best if proliferation
were extended to Germany but not beyond.111

In 1993, Posen writes that nuclear weapons tempered the disintegration
of the Soviet Union but would have inflamed the conflict associated with
the disintegration of Yugoslavia. 'In some cases, \[but not all\]
nuclear weaponry may be an effective way of protecting the weak from the
strong'. 112 Finally, Bandow cautions in 1994 that: 'mutual possession
of nuclear weapons may deter possible aggression. Yet as one moves away
from Europe to regions with a higher propensity for war, and where
potential strife is multilateral, the risks grow. This is why North
Korea is so unsettling.' 113 Clearly, [proliferation optimism **regards
states as unequal** in their capacity to rule in international
society]{.underline}. In this regard, it agrees with Burke when he
writes: 'all men have equal rights; but not to equal things \... and as
to the share of power, authority, and direction which each individual
ought to have in the management of the state, that I must deny to be
amongst the direct, original rights of man in civil society.' And when
he warns: '[The effect of liberty to individuals is]{.underline}, [that
they may do what they please]{.underline}; we ought to see what it will
please them to do, before we risk [congratulations]{.underline}, which
[may be soon turned to **complaints'**]{.underline}.114

Optimism resembles conservatism in a third way. It underscores deep
respect and slow change as conditions essential to realizing the good
society. Within optimism, qualified states have leaders whose defining
trait is actually not, as Waltz describes, 'rational fear' but
conservative 'respect' (qua the manners of a gentleman): respect for
nuclear arms, the lessons of history, previous achievements and the
unborn future. Introducing the notion of 'respect' better captures the
sharp distinction between pedestrian hysteria and elite fear implied in
the optimist literature. In other words, because hysteria and fear share
an emotional heritage that respect and hysteria do not, it is
respect-as-manners, not fear, that separates the dutiful leadership from
the quivering populace. And respect for the authority vested in nuclear
technology obviates the need for artificial social institutions, or
forms of control, such as the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, the
implementation of which can only make matters worse. 115 When respect
and gradual change coincide, the good society may be achieved. In this
vein, Bull writes in 1968 that: 'short of a revolution in the present
organization of world politics, the spread of the capability to make
nuclear weapons is inevitable \... \[mitigating this\] requires slowing
down the pace of the spread so that the international political system
is able to absorb its impact." 116 Waltz, the consummate optimist,
voices similar reservations over the next three decades. In 1995 he
reiterates a position he first expresses in 1979: 'I have argued that
the gradual spread of nuclear weapons is better than either no spread or
rapid spread \... Since rapid changes in international conditions can be
unsettling, the slowness of the spread of nuclear weapons is
fortunate.'117

Provided the claim in this article, optimism resembles conservatism in
two final ways. It ultimately preserves prevailing social or community
opinion. Canavan notes conservative 'Prejudice is not only old opinion.
As a social force it is common or social opinion. When such opinion was
founded on long popular experience, Burke had great faith in it.' 118
Quester, in an introduction, reveals that non-proliferation endeavours
rest on subjective feeling---social opinion---rather than objective
truth. He writes: 'consistent with the general opposition to further
proliferation, most of us as authors simply view a proliferated world
with unrelieved dread \... \[it is\] a common sense, which is
increasingly affecting the world on the proliferation issue, that such
proliferation would simply be bad.' 119 [Proliferation optimism
ultimately succumbs to prevailing international social
opinion]{.underline}---[the way things are or should
be]{.underline}---[when it reproduces pessimism]{.underline}. Lastly,
[when Waltz]{.underline} and his followers [qualify their view of
nuclear proliferation they distance themselves from abstract neorealism
and its main classical figure]{.underline}, Rousseau 120 , just as does
Burke throughout the Reflections. Waltz concedes that states are not
abstract units free to act on their assessment of the future in a
self-help environment, but are bound to the past and its institutions:
'To give therefore no more importance, in the social order, to such
descriptions of men, than that of so many units, is a horrible
usurpation.'121

Optimism resembles conservatism. It views states as unalike in their
capacity to handle nuclear weapons, counsels gradual spread to qualified
states and denies unfit states the means to rule in global society.
Recalling the microeconomic analogical reasoning that allows Waltz to
develop sequentially his Theory of International Politics and
proliferation optimism, it is reasonable to wonder why optimism
confronts the spread of nuclear arms with such dismay and hesitancy. A
conservative lens provides the answer. Since conservatism emanates from
a determinative and pessimistic view of human nature, and since optimism
abandons its faith in microeconomics (through qualifications on
self-help units, reciprocal relationships and likely behaviour in favour
of denial, leadership and authority) yet reproduces quite conservative
admonitions, it is clear that optimism as neorealism retains a deeply
pessimistic view of humankind. In this way, since all humanity is flawed
and human nature shapes society (which neorealism admits via its
conservative reservations) all proliferation is dangerous as imperfect
human nature determines all political leaders and social institutions,
not merely the so-called depraved or rogue members of international
society. When the question is the actual spread of nuclear weapons,
Waltz and his optimists come to resemble Burke much more than, say,
Friedman.

Conclusion

Proliferation optimism, which asserts that the wide spread of nuclear
arms leads to nuclear peace, is the controversial theoretical and
practical product of neorealism. To hinder optimism and so the continued
proliferation of nuclear weapons, most scholars criticize as
inappropriate, unrealistic or just plain wrong, the basic yet prominent
assumptions of proliferation optimism and neorealism. This article uses
a different approach. Rather than preserving pessimism by disproving
optimism, it embraces a basic principle of critical theory and asks how
[proliferation optimism reproduces what it seeks to explain away:
proliferation pessimism]{.underline}. [It interprets optimism through
the lens of Burkean conservatism and contends that, as the ideal nuclear
society which optimism envisions resembles the ideal conservative
society Burke depicts in the Reflections, so optimism reproduces a
central tenet of conservatism: flawed human nature]{.underline}. This
article argues that [an unheralded view of human nature operates within
proliferation optimism to produce its reservations about the wide spread
of nuclear weapons, which in turn, indicates its essential
pessimism]{.underline}. [Since the irrelevance of human nature is a
first principle for neorealism, as delineated in Waltz's Man, the State
and War, its presence and effect are unexpected and
noteworthy]{.underline}. By illuminating how optimism is pessimism the
article diminishes its theoretical and practical allure---it is an empty
rather than viable theoretical or practical choice---and second,
illustrates how Burke influences a version of contemporary international
theory.

# Impact\-\--Arctic Warming Good

## Notes

Didn't do much on shipping routes because I heard BFHR was already doing
something there, but the Mahmoud evidence is really good for that
scenario.

You can turn some of the arguments on the shipping routes part into
'transportation increasing with warming good' as another warming good
reason. Maybe a trade impact in another file could work too.

You should argue no warming impact + an external impact at least. REMs
solve warming is sort of a trick/even if claim. The Bidgood card and
'Arctic Paradox' evidence should be fine.

Other files that can work:

- Biodiversity/Environment DA cards can be used here for mining
  good/bad.

- Independence/Greenland Secession DA can help a 'Greenland mining bad'
  debate.

- Impact defense should be in CMSW's impact defense file.

- DSM AFF/NEG has some "REMs key" and "REMs bad" cards/warrants.

Green tech

- You might also be able to leverage green tech holistically

- I think at least you have to defend renewables solve if you're saying
  Arctic Paradox.

[Discussion and conclusion]{.underline}

\<\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

This investigation provides significant contributions to the scholarly
comprehension of the ramifications of climate change on Arctic
navigation, extending its relevance to the formulation of environmental
policies and the operational strategies of maritime industries. It
offers a valuable predictive framework for elucidating future
trajectories in Arctic shipping routes. Furthermore, this study lays the
groundwork for subsequent research aimed at optimizing maritime routes,
incorporating a comprehensive consideration of the diverse requisites of
various maritime sectors. Additionally, the inclusion of an array of
ship categories in this analysis facilitates a deeper exploration into
the economic dimensions of Arctic navigation, presenting opportunities
for further detailed economic assessments. Moreover, this research
distinctly advances our understanding by conducting analyses for each of
the 14 sections of the Arctic routes, tailored to accommodate varying
types of ships. This segmentation of the route into discrete sections
and their subsequent individual analysis is a novel approach not
previously explored in existing studies. This detailed breakdown enables
future research to meticulously examine each section in relation to
different ship categories, thereby offering a more granular and precise
understanding of Arctic navigation. Such an approach has the potential
to yield unprecedented insights into the interaction between specific
route sections and various ship types, facilitating a more targeted and
efficient assessment of navigational strategies and risks in the Arctic
context.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>\>

The [consequences of climate change on the NSR are]{.underline} of
substantial and **[multifaceted]{.underline}** significance. The
[[diminishing sea ice]{.underline}]{.mark} in these regions has
[[ushered]{.mark} in [**novel** shipping
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit with attendant complexities.
Polar vessels are particularly susceptible to temperature fluctuations
and variations in sea ice thickness, which introduce risks and
difficulties in the demanding Arctic and Antarctic environments.
Temperature fluctuations influence the melting and formation of sea ice,
consequently impacting navigational conditions, either facilitating or
hindering maritime transit. Ships operating in polar regions must be
attuned to these environmental fluctuations and adapt their routes
accordingly, as thicker ice necessitates specialized navigation
capabilities, whereas thinner ice conceals latent hazards.

Furthermore, the [composition of Arctic Sea ice]{.underline} has
[undergone a]{.underline} noteworthy
[[transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}, shifting [[from]{.mark}
predominantly [thick multi-year ice to **younger**]{.mark} and
[**thinner** seasonal ice]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [likelihood of an
[ice-free]{.mark} [Arctic summer increases]{.mark} in **tandem** [with
**global warming**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under the scenario of
stabilizing global warming at 1.5°C, there is an approximate 2% chance
of an ice-free summer occurring in any given year, with this probability
rising to 19--34 percent at 2 °C. Some [computational
models]{.underline} even [project that the [Arctic Ocean could become
**seasonally ice-free**]{.mark} within the coming decades]{.underline}
10.

The observations generated by this study align with the findings of
[Chalecki]{.underline} 9, who previously [reported]{.underline} [that
contemporary [models suggest]{.mark} a transition from [**gradual** ice
thinning to **rapid ice loss**]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
[resulting in a virtually [ice-free]{.mark} Arctic during the summer [by
2040]{.mark}, an [**earlier timeframe** than previously]{.mark}
[anticipated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, both
[Ravindran]{.underline} et al., 50 [and Notz and Community]{.underline},
2020 31 have [indicated]{.underline} the likelihood of [an ice-free
Arctic surface during September occurring **prior to
2050**]{.underline}: a substantial reduction or absence of sea ice cover
during that specific period.

This study examines the accessibility of the NSR to different ship
categories under two climate change scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 for
50 years. The ship categories considered are Polar class 1, Polar class
3, Polar class 5, Polar class 7, Type IB, and Pleasure crafts. Polar
class 1 and Polar class 3 vessels consistently maintain accessibility
throughout the year for both scenarios. Polar class 5 vessels experience
fluctuations in their availability, initially marked by unavailability
followed by subsequent periods of accessibility. Polar class 7 ships
predominantly exhibit unavailability during specific trimesters but
subsequently become accessible during other months for SSP2-4.5
scenario. Type IB ships and Pleasure crafts consistently register
unavailability, with sporadic windows of accessibility in particular
months for SSP2-4.5 scenario, while they ensure continuous accessibility
throughout the year for SSP5-8.5. These findings yield valuable insights
for the strategic planning of shipping route availability and the
potential allocation of resources along these routes.

Lin et al.,51 delineated the [primary [**challenges** and **hazards**
confronting ships]{.mark} traversing Arctic shipping
route]{.underline}s, encompassing:

Factors related to [low temperature]{.underline}

Factors related to [sea ice]{.underline}

Factors related to [poor visibility]{.underline}

Factors related to [communication]{.underline}

[Lack of infrastructure]{.underline}

[Lack of navigational experience]{.underline}

[Lack of historical data]{.underline}

[High risk of collision]{.underline}

[Complex navigational conditions]{.underline}

These [factors]{.underline} have been [[**scrutinized** in the context
of]{.mark} the [climate change]{.mark} scenarios delineated in the
study.]{.underline} Observations indicate that [[**reduced**
temperatures]{.mark} could]{.underline} potentially [[**impair** crew
performance]{.underline}]{.mark}, attenuating their responsiveness to
external conditions and decreasing precipitation, as corroborated by
Zhang et al. 52. However, [an **[incre]{.mark}a[se]{.mark}** [in
**ambient** temperatures]{.mark} along]{.underline} the selected route
could potentially [[**ameliorate** these risks]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In the context of sea ice factors, Eq. (1), which quantifies
navigational risks for ships, has been employed in this study. This
equation encapsulates the hazards associated with floating ice, as
documented by Li et al.53 and Xu et al.54. The [Arctic
region]{.underline} is characterized by [[poor visibility
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}, primarily [[attributable to **sea ice and
snow**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as noted by Goerlandt et al.55. Projections
under both climate change scenarios indicate a slight increase in
precipitation over the recommended path (Fig. 5), suggesting that the
risk associated with poor visibility is unlikely to diminish.

[[Communication deficiencies]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of the
[**leading** [causes of **ship collision**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Arctic shipping routes 54,56, can be attributed to the limitations of
mobile data collection equipment, such as unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs), under low-temperature conditions 51,57. These devices encounter
operational restrictions, resulting in constrained data acquisition
measures. However, under the projected climate change scenario, [a
[**marginal** increase in **temperature**]{.mark} could]{.underline}
potentially [[**alleviate** these]{.mark}
[constraints]{.mark}]{.underline}. The anticipated rise in ambient
temperatures along the selected trajectory could [serve as a
**[mitigating]{.mark} factor** against these
[risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is also noteworthy to mention that the mobility of ice floes, which
are persistently influenced by wind patterns, poses a significant
challenge for ship-based communication58. This dynamic nature of the ice
floes further exacerbates the communication difficulties experienced in
these environments.

In relation to the potential hazards associated with the [[absence of
infrastructure, lack of navigational experience, and deficiency of
historical data]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is hypothesized that these
risks [will]{.underline} likely **[[diminish]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
correlation [[with an]{.mark} [**increase** in **maritime
voyages**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[predicted by]{.mark} climate change
[models]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [assertion]{.underline} is
[predicated on the assumption that [increased]{.mark}]{.underline}
frequency of [[ship trips will **contribute** to]{.mark} the
[**accumulation** of experience]{.mark} [and data]{.mark}]{.underline},
thereby [**[mitigating]{.mark}** these]{.underline} identified
[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}. Further empirical investigation is
warranted to substantiate this hypothesis.

[[Incidents involving collisions]{.mark} between icebreakers
and]{.underline} the [vessels they escort]{.underline} represent the
most frequently reported accidents in the context of polar ship
formation navigation59,60. It is anticipated that the [**frequency** of
such incidents [will **decrease**]{.mark} significantly [in
response]{.mark} to the [**reduced deployment** of
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [trend]{.underline} that [is
projected to [**continue** under]{.mark} various [climate change
scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore, [the [risk associated
with]{.mark} complex [navigational conditions]{.mark} is expected to be
**[substantially mitigated]{.mark}**]{.underline} by the selection of
the route proposed in this study, which avoids areas of narrow or
shallow water depth.

Projected Navigation Feasibility of the NSR

The [[reduction in sea ice thickness]{.underline}]{.mark} bears
significant implications for transpolar shipping operations, primarily
[[influencing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**suitability** of
vessels]{.mark} capable of navigating ice-covered waters]{.underline}.
The [[diminishing sea ice]{.underline}]{.mark} permits the utilization
of polar-class vessels with lower ice class designations, [[leading to
**reduced fuel consumption** and **emissions**]{.underline}]{.mark} 8.
This study investigated the impact of climate change on the navigation
feasibility of the NSR for different ship categories. Figure 6 presents
a detailed analysis for each of the 14 sections constituting the
navigation route. It delineates the number of months per annum during
which a specific type of vessel can navigate through a given segment of
the route, as per the projected climate change scenarios for the years
2030, 2040, and 2050. The examined ship categories encompass Polar class
1, Polar class 3, Polar class 5, Polar class 7, Type IB, and Pleasure
crafts. Within the SSP2-4.5 scenario in 2030, Polar class 1 and Polar
class 3 vessels consistently demonstrate availability throughout the
year. Polar class 5 ships initially experience unavailability in the
first seven months, with subsequent accessibility from August to
December. Conversely, Polar class 7 ships are unavailable for ten months
and will only be accessed in September and October. Type IB ships and
Pleasure crafts uniformly remain unavailable throughout the year. For
the SSP5-8.5 scenario in 2030, Polar class 1 and Polar class 3 ships
maintain continuous availability. Polar class 5 ships operate during the
first trimester, followed by inoperability from April to June, with
functionality from July to December. Polar class 7 ships lack
availability during the first trimester but subsequently become
accessible from August to December. Type IB ships exhibit limited
availability, excluding August to December. Pleasure crafts remain
nonoperational in the initial nine months but become viable in
September.

**[[decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** going through the 21st century to

routes because the distance saved via the Arctic relative to Panama is
relatively modest. [[For a **high-emissions**

The [[reduced transit times]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[lead to

and [lower]{.mark} [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}, in addition to
potentially **[[reducing global shipping

[**fastest** and **shortest**]{.mark} route, and [avoids Russian NSR

utilize Arctic routes face choices about whether to invest in
technologically advanced ice-capable ships enabling a longer and more
reliable shipping season (Figure 4). These choices should consider the
changing Arctic environment and the risks and opportunities this will
offer. In addition to the dramatic changes to the sea ice pack,
[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} is likely to [[**modify**
other]{.underline}]{.mark} climatic [[hazards]{.underline}]{.mark} to
shipping not assessed here such as ice ridging, fog, waves, and icing as
discussed by Aksenov et al. \[2015\]; developing the full potential for
trans-Arctic shipping will require knowledge of these along with
comprehensive en route infrastructure, providing incentives for
substantial investment in Arctic regions. It should be noted that
despite these climatic opportunities, economic studies are mixed as to
whether trans-Arctic shipping will become a reality due to the vagaries
and seasonal nature of Arctic navigation \[Bensassi et al., 2016;
Lasserre, 2014; Lasserre and Pelletier, 2011\]. However, [emergent

For bears of both the market and polar kind, a planet without an ice cap
is a tragedy. [The Arctic is warming four times faster than the world at
large, causing ice to shrink by an area the size of Austria each
year.]{.underline} Since the 1980s the volume of ice has fallen by 70%
or more. The Arctic's first ice-free day may occur before 2030.

A [[warming Arctic should yield **enormous
dividends**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Retreating ice will [create
**[shipping shortcuts]{.mark}**. Maritime access [and]{.mark} melting
glaciers will make it easier to extract **[minerals]{.mark}**, just when

geology]{.underline}. [Warming waters may entice hordes of
**fish**]{.underline}. This [could upend trade, energy and
geopolitics]{.underline}. The prospect has sparked a rush of diplomats
and miners. In December China set a world record, unveiling a
"polar-ready" 58,000-tonne cargo ship. One red-hatted politician has
talked of seizing Greenland. The obstacles, though, are as big as the
opportunities. Last month Norway paused plans for deep-sea mining;
Russia's own efforts have halted. Can the prize be grasped? And on what
timescale?

[[One benefit]{.mark} already on offer [is **bigger
catches**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some species, such as snow crab and
Alaska's king salmon, are struggling in warmer, somewhat acidified
water. And an international agreement has restricted fishing in the high
seas. But this is more than balanced by the fact that [[species from
southern and temperate waters, including Atlantic cod, are moving
to]{.mark} areas such as [the Barents and Bering
seas]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nutrient-rich water could also help
populations grow faster, while]{.mark} receding [ice opens up new
grounds and lengthens fishing seasons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mackerel did
not arrive off Greenland until 2011. By 2014 the oily fish represented
23% of the island's total export earnings.

Such benefits may pale in comparison to those offered by [new shipping
routes]{.underline}. To grasp how climate change may transform them, see
the map below. [[Melting ice]{.mark} could open [three
paths]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first, known as the Northern Sea Route
([[NSR]{.underline}]{.mark}), hugs the Russian coast to connect the
Barents Sea with the Bering Strait. A second, dubbed the North-West
Passage ([[NWP]{.underline}]{.mark}), runs along the North American
Arctic coastline, from the Beaufort Sea to Baffin Bay. Last comes the
Transpolar Sea Route ([[TSR]{.underline}]{.mark}), which runs over the
North Pole.

\[IMAGE OMMITTED\]

[[All]{.underline} [three could shorten trips between Asia, North
America and Europe, which account for most shipping, **saving on fuel
and wages**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} They could also [avoid
chokepoints]{.underline} such as the Panama and Suez canals, [which are
busy]{.underline}, charge fees [and]{.underline}, in the case of Suez,
[link to dangerous waters.]{.underline}

Exactly when these promises might be fulfilled depends on the route.
The NWP, which runs through Canada's Arctic Archipelago, consists of
narrow, winding channels. It is melting more slowly than the NSR.
Although it stretches 1,500km, it has only one deep-water port and lacks
emergency facilities. Canada claims the NWP is in its waters; America
and Europe deem it an international strait. The route is also shallow,
limiting the size of vessels.

The TSR dodges many of these problems. It traverses the Central Arctic
Ocean, which is much deeper. It avoids territorial waters, cooling the
political temperature. And it provides the shortest route from the North
Atlantic to the Pacific. Proponents foresee thousands of vessels a year
shuttling between North America and Asia, stopping en route at Alaska's
Dutch Harbour. Even when the ice is gone, though, the route will be
littered with icebergs, making it navigable only by icebreakers. The
vision of thousands of ships may have to wait until 2050 or so.

Sea change

That makes the NSR the most promising option available. The route has
been open to ice-resistant ships in the summer almost every year since
2005. Sections are navigable all year, albeit with the help of an
icebreaker escort, which is expensive. Traffic is rising nevertheless: a
record 92 ships navigated the NSR last year, up from 19 in 2016. As ice
continues to melt, the NSR could appeal to two types of voyages. One is
traffic focused on the transport of resources from Russia's far north.
The country has long aimed to secure year-round energy exports by
shipping liquefied natural gas to Europe in the winter (for heating) and
Asia in the summer (for cooling). Although that grand vision receded
after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, when Europe cut some links
with its neighbour, the NSR could still help Russia ship coal, gas and
metals to China and India.

The route may also lure some of the traffic connecting Asia to Europe.
It is unlikely to be used much for container ships, which tend to hop
along hubs in the Gulf or South-East Asia rather than travel the whole
route between Europe and Asia, says Rasmus Bertelsen of the UiT The
Arctic University of Norway. The north's rough seas also risk thwarting
the just-in-time logistics of the modern goods trade. However, it could
reduce the distance between Rotterdam and Shanghai by 5,000km, or 25%,
and slash the journey from 30 to 14 days. As a consequence, despite the
route's defects, it could still boost overall trade between Asia and
the EU by 6%, according to Eddy Bekkers, now at the World Trade
Organisation, and colleagues.

The [[Arctic's last prize]{.mark} concerns commodities. This used to
mean **[hydrocarbons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The region is thought to
hold 13% of the world's undiscovered oil and 30% of untapped natural
gas. But its deposits are among the costliest to exploit---not ideal
when demand for oil is flagging and a glut of natural gas, produced more
cheaply in America and Qatar, is on the way.

Instead, [[the hope lies with]{.mark} the [Arctic's "green" minerals,
which]{.mark} global [warming is making more accessible]{.mark}. They
include cobalt, graphite, lithium and nickel, important
[ingredients]{.mark} in electric-car batteries; zinc, [used in **solar
panels and wind turbines**]{.mark}; copper, [required for all sorts of
things electric; and rare earths, crucial to many types of green and
military equipment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Niche metals including
titanium, tungsten and vanadium, used to make "super-alloys", are also
prized. Greenland looks especially well resourced in this regard. The
island has reserves of 43 out of 50 minerals deemed "critical" by the
American government. Its known rare earths amount to 42m tonnes, some
120 times more than the world mined in 2023.

Most of the Arctic's minerals have not been mapped out in detail, notes
Per Kalvig, who co-wrote a geological survey of Greenland. As such, any
exploitation could be at least a decade away. But the International
Energy Agency, an official forecaster, reckons that the global market
for such minerals will double in value by 2040, if countries stick to
existing climate pledges. Western countries are also eager to discover
new sources so as to bypass China, which dominates supply.

## Minerals

### Minerals\-\--1NC

#### Mining's key to China [decoupling]{.underline} and a [clean energy]{.underline} transition. Continued warming is [key]{.underline}.

**Evans '25**, \[Scarlett Evans, \"Mining the Arctic: a rare earth
'cold' rush'?,\"
https://www.mining-technology.com/features/mining-arctic-rare-earth/Sino-Russia,
Published February 3^rd^, 2025, Accessed July 10^th^, 2025 // ajap\]

In its 2024 Economic Report, the Arctic Economic Council
([AEC]{.underline}) [highlighted]{.underline} the potentially [pivotal
role **[mining in Arctic]{.mark} nations** could play in
[fuelling]{.mark} the world's **[increasing demand]{.mark} for critical
raw materials**]{.underline}.

It stated that the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region, which
encompasses parts of eight separate countries, is [[home to **31**
of]{.mark} the [34 materials]{.mark} identified as [essential for clean
energy technology]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Of note within these are rare earth elements
([[REEs]{.underline}]{.mark}), [materials necessary for a range of clean
energy technologies including]{.underline} electric vehicles
([EVs]{.underline}), [batteries and wind turbines]{.underline}. REEs in
particular are being eyed up in Norway, Sweden and Greenland.

Mining is not new to the Arctic region. [[Alaska]{.mark} is home to the
[**largest zinc** mine]{.mark} in the world and [Sweden]{.mark} to the
[largest iron]{.mark} ore [mine]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}. However,
[high wages and strict regulatory frameworks have been something of a
deterrent to mining companies' activity in the region as they typically
want to extract as much as possible with minimal overheads.]{.underline}

Short daylight hours and extreme cold have also proven to be a hurdle to
investors looking to build infrastructure in the Arctic, as well as
companies that must provide high wages to attract any kind of workforce.
The result is that the [region's [mineral]{.mark} [potential]{.mark} has
remained relatively [untapped]{.mark} despite its resources]{.underline}
-- something the AEC, among others, is looking to change.

With projections that [[critical minerals needs]{.underline}]{.mark},
including those for [REEs]{.underline}, are [set to **[rise
exponentially]{.mark}**]{.underline}, coupled with mounting [[fears of
an **overreliance** on]{.mark} rare earth superpower
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}, a renewed [spotlight is being put on the
[Arctic]{.mark} as a potential [mining hotspot]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The minerals appeal of the Arctic

"The Arctic region has three things that have always (and will always)
be exported," says Mads Qvist Frederiksen, executive director at AEC.
"Fish, energy and raw materials --- with the latter going back to the
1600s.

"Fast forward, and with the rise of industrialisation the world needs
more and more minerals as it needs more technologies, meaning the
[Arctic's [raw materials]{.mark} are [getting **renewed**
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency, [[demand]{.mark}
for critical minerals will **[nearly triple]{.mark}** by
2030]{.underline}, growing to more than 3.5-times the current levels by
2050. This, alongside the fact that the [[Arctic]{.mark} is feeling the
effects of climate change more keenly than anywhere else]{.underline} --
[[warming **four-times faster**]{.underline}]{.mark} than the rest of
the world, according to research in Nature -- [has [given]{.mark} some
**[urgency]{.mark}** to the Arctic focus]{.underline}.

Currently, no REEs are mined in Europe, although the landscape is
shifting, and exploration of the Arctic has already proven it is home to
significant deposits of the materials.

According to the Arctic Review, [[Greenland]{.mark} has enough
[reserves]{.mark}]{.underline} of minerals such as neodymium and
dysprosium [to [meet]{.mark} at least a **[quarter of future global
demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}, around [38.5 million tonnes]{.underline}
(mt).

Additionally, in 2023, Swedish miner LKAB made headlines by announcing
it had identified a [REE deposit in Kiruna that exceeds 1mt of rare
earth oxides]{.underline}. The discovery was, briefly, the [largest
deposit of its kind in Europe]{.underline}, before being overtaken in
2024 by Norway's Fen Carbonatite Complex in Telemark.

While LKAB is still conducting research into the Kiruna deposit, the
[discovery adds to the perception of the Nordic Arctic as a **[viable
supply alternative]{.mark}** to China]{.underline} -- evidenced by
Donald Trump's renewed mission to gain control of Greenland's minerals.

"The two [main [drivers]{.mark} for people looking to the region are
[**climate change** and **geopolitics**]{.mark}]{.underline}," explains
Frederiksen. "Of course, [we need [critical raw materials]{.mark} to
[pursue]{.mark} a [green transition]{.mark}]{.underline}, but people are
also looking for control, and with nations like [China stockpiling
materials including rare earths, people are becoming [**concerned**
about **resource control**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

#### Arctic warming is [paradoxical]{.underline}. Solutions to warming require [temporary]{.underline} environmental damage.

Climate Change and the Arctic Paradox

Traditionally, [[barriers to exploration in the Arctic]{.mark} have
[included]{.mark} significant cover by **[glacial
deposits]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[sediments, **permafrost**]{.mark},
and **ice**]{.underline}, as well as [[barriers to access]{.mark} such
as [**extensive sea ice**, large areas and]{.mark} **[harsh
environments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [the search for the
[north-east passage]{.mark} began in the 16th Century]{.underline} [but
was [not traversed until]{.mark} the [late 19th Century owing to the
**extensive** ice cover]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, barriers such as
lack of infrastructure, lack of data and high cost of exploration are
still significant. Despite this, [there have been **tremendous** efforts
to expand our **knowledge** of the Arctic resulting in]{.underline}
examples such as [small-scale geological maps]{.underline} (e.g.,
Harrison et al., 2011; Behnia et al., 2013; Petrov and Smelror, 2015;
Petrov et al., 2021).

The [Arctic]{.underline} is [experiencing]{.underline} the impact of
[climate change **much** faster than other parts of the
world]{.underline}. Whilst [[warming climates **expand**]{.mark} access
to **[navigation]{.mark}** opportunities [and **untapped** mineral
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, they at the same time bring lasting
impacts on the wellbeing of its people and the environment.
Additionally, resource extraction, including raw materials for low
carbon technology, has the potential to disrupt the social, cultural,
and ecological wellbeing in project-affected areas (Larsen and
Ingimundarson, 2023). This is the **[[Arctic
paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where our need for [[**solutions** to
combat climate change have]{.mark} the potential to have [negative
impacts on]{.mark} the [people and environments]{.mark} most
[affected]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Although [mining]{.mark} has the **potential** to have negative
effects]{.underline} on the local environment and people, [it can also
[bring]{.mark} **positive effects** and **opportunities**, such as
[**infrastructure** and **jobs**]{.mark}, [to]{.mark} these [remote
regions]{.mark}]{.underline}; development which is often looked on
favourably, and even in some cases invited by local communities
(Langston, 2021). [[Mining]{.mark} is]{.underline} therefore
[**[inexorably]{.mark}** linked to [**sustainable**
development]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[touching]{.underline}]{.mark} on
[[**all 17** of]{.mark} the UN's [s]{.mark}ustainable
[d]{.mark}evelopment [g]{.mark}oal[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (Monteiro et
al., 2019). Arctic peoples have traditionally protected the environment,
maintaining and enhancing the environment for future generations
(Ahtuangaruak, 2018). Socio-environmental conflicts, primarily involving
extractive industries and infrastructure development, often overlap with
Indigenous peoples' territories (Hanaček et al., 2022). Arctic residents
are therefore seeking to have a bigger say when it comes to Arctic
decision-making, incorporating the rich knowledge of local environments
and a long history of interaction with mining and industrial
development.

**[increase]{.mark}** in the decades ahead]{.underline}. A 2020 World

[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[geoeconomics]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the 21st century. The classification of these materials as 'critical'
generally considers their economic significance, supply risks and the
availability of substitutes. Criticality is determined by how essential
a resource is to a region's or State's economy and its vulnerability to
supply disruptions due to geopolitical, environmental or market factors.
In simple terms, CRMs are 'securitised' raw materials, Footnote 4
indicating how indispensable a material is for various industries and

Early stages

Jakob Kløve Keiding, senior consultant at the Geological Survey of
Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), said a 2023 survey of
[[Greenland's]{.mark} resource [potential]{.mark}]{.underline} evaluated
a total of **[[38 raw materials]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the island,
the [**vast** majority]{.underline} of which [have a [relatively]{.mark}
**[high]{.mark}**]{.underline} or moderate
[[potential]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These [materials [include]{.mark} the [r]{.mark}]{.underline}are
[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}arth [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}etals graphite,
niobium, platinum group metals, [molybdenum]{.underline}, tantalum and
[titanium]{.underline}. Greenland is also known to have significant
[[lithium]{.underline}]{.mark}, hafnium, [[**uranium** and **gold
deposits**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark} refer to a subset of materials
considered [[**essential** to]{.mark} the **[energy
transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The end-use of these materials, which
[tend to [have a **high risk** of **supply chain
disruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}, are wide-ranging and include
[e]{.underline}lectric [v]{.underline}ehicle batteries, [[**energy
storage** technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[**national security**
applications]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"There is huge potential \[in Greenland\] but, at the moment, there is
[not]{.underline} actually [much [mining]{.mark} going]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}," Keiding told CNBC via telephone.

"[Greenland]{.underline} is what we would call a greenfield exploration
area. So, \[it is\] [[in]{.mark} the **[early stages]{.mark}** of
exploration]{.underline} where, for many of the deposits, we don't have
that much data. But [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[**[large]{.mark}** and **well-established** [deposits with
**known**]{.mark} **[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Keiding issued a note of caution when asked about the prospect of a
mineral gold rush, saying that while Greenland's retreating ice may
remove some logistical hurdles, progress in terms of extraction will
likely take "quite some time."

Meeting The Global Supply Chain Challenge

[Global [demand for r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth[s]{.mark} is **[rising
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the International Energy
Agency ([IEA]{.underline}), the [[production]{.mark} of rare
earths]{.underline} will [[need to **increase sevenfold**]{.mark} by
2040 [to meet]{.mark} the [needs of]{.mark} the [clean energy
sector]{.mark} **[alone]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However, [[supply
chains]{.mark} remain **[highly centralized]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with
[[China]{.mark} accounting for more than [**60%** of]{.mark} global
**r**are **e**arth [mining]{.mark} and]{.underline} nearly [[**90%** of
refining]{.underline}]{.mark}. This concentration heightens [[supply
chain risks]{.mark}, especially [as **geopolitical tensions**
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. This creates a unique challenge: how to
secure a reliable and sustainable supply of rare earths in a highly
competitive global economy where supply chains are becoming increasingly
strained.

The [need to expand the global rare earth supply chain]{.underline} has
become increasingly **[urgent]{.underline}**. To address these risks,
many [[countries]{.mark} are **[actively diversifying]{.mark}** their
rare earth supply chains]{.underline}. Western nations like the

[[should **act quickly**]{.underline}]{.mark} and reestablish a robust
strategic rare earth element reserve.

From 1939 to the 1980s (prior to World War II through the end of the
Cold War), the United States maintained stockpiles of rare earth
elements to create a buffer against shortages and allow for
uninterrupted defense production through the Strategic and Critical
Materials Stock Piling Act. With the relative global calm following the
Cold War, the United States sold off its stockpiles, accepting the
theory that global supply chains would support rapid scaling in times of
conflict. However, [the [Covid]{.mark}-19 pandemic starkly
**[illuminated]{.mark}** a [U.S. **vulnerability**, exposing
**critical**]{.mark} supply [chain disruptions]{.mark} that severely
impacted]{.underline} the United States' [ability to procure
**necessary** materials in a **timely manner**]{.underline}.

The idea of a strategic stockpile isn't new. The United States already
maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established in the aftermath
of the 1973 oil embargo, to safeguard against severe energy disruptions.
It serves as an emergency buffer to stabilize markets and protect the
country from the economic shocks that tend to follow geopolitical
crises. The Department of Defense has consistently identified rare earth
elements and critical minerals as essential to virtually every major
weapons system, from fighter jets to precision-guided munitions.

A robust [reserve of **r**]{.underline}are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[e]{.underline}**lement**[s]{.underline}** is [necessary to
support]{.underline} a policy of **[global deterrence]{.underline}**, as
[it would signal to adversaries that]{.underline} economic coercion
through [supply chain disruption cannot prevent]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from scaling up the
**d**]{.underline}efense **[i]{.underline}**ndustrial
**[b]{.underline}**ase production [during a crisis. [Reliance on]{.mark}
foreign suppliers, particularly [China, exposes the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[allies to **strategic
vulnerabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent history provides
precedent to underscore the risk.

[In 2010, [China suspended]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[exports]{.mark} of
**r**]{.underline}are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[e]{.underline}**lement[**s** [to Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. During a
period of increased diplomatic tensions, [this [caused **immediate
disruptions** in]{.mark} Japan's [high-tech and automotive
industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This coercive [maneuver highlighted how
quickly [economic security can be **compromised**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in an age of global supply chains. Drawing a parallel to the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, a similar initiative for rare earth elements would
demonstrate to potential adversaries that the United States possesses
the strategic depth to sustain prolonged conflict, thereby reducing the
likelihood that those adversaries would initiate hostilities in the
first place.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} near [[monopoly]{.mark}]{.underline} on
global **[r]{.underline}**are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[e]{.underline}**lement [processing places the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its [allies in a
**[precarious]{.mark}** strategic position]{.underline}. Previously, the
United States stockpiled up to five years of strategic materials to
account for a protracted conflict and mitigate unforeseen contingencies.
The stockpile also provided options to establish alternative supply
routes and stand-up domestic production. Returning to a robust strategic
rare earth element reserve would enhance U.S. standing in global
negotiations, affirming the United States' readiness and
self-sufficiency, thereby deterring potential adversaries from utilizing
resource manipulation as leverage.

Establishing such a reserve raises concerns over cost and environmental
impact. While the Strategic Petroleum Reserve required billions over
decades, a rare earth reserve should cost substantially less, given the
smaller quantities needed while providing outsized strategic value.
Critics argue investments should target supply chain diversification or
alternative technologies instead. These long-term strategies have merit
but cannot address immediate threats, and technological shifts away from
rare earth dependency remain speculative. As for environmental impact,
the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[must pursue **responsible** domestic production]{.mark} rather than
perpetuate]{.underline} its dangerous [**dependence** on
China.]{.underline} [[**Modern** extraction
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[**minimize** environmental
costs]{.underline}]{.mark} while [[eliminating]{.underline}]{.mark} the
far greater [[risks of **economic coercion** and **military
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} invited [by]{.underline} the United
States' **[current vulnerabilities]{.underline}**.

[The question is not **whether** to act, but how quickly the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can implement this
**critical safeguard**.]{.underline} Congress already passed legislation
through Section 1411 of the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act,
mandating rare earth independence from China, Russia, North Korea, and
Iran by 2035. The legislative foundation exists---what's missing is the
urgency to address the United States' dependency on foreign suppliers
that demand immediate action beyond statutory deadlines. There are also
other ways, such as the recently announced Pentagon investment in MP
Materials, which operates an operational rare earth mine and is in the
process of building a second magnet manufacturing facility.

A strategic rare earth element reserve is not a luxury---it is a
necessity. The ability to deter, respond, and win in future conflicts
will depend on it. The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should act with **clarity**, **speed**, and
**strength**]{.underline}---in the next fight, the availability of rare
earth elements for defense production will be as decisive as soldiers on
the battlefield.

Sustainability in Mining

Looking to the future of mining in the Arctic: can this industry provide
an opportunity for sustainable development and reconciliation?
Sustainable development has been defined as "development which meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Commission, 1987).
Whilst sustainable mining may be an oxymoron, [[sustainability in
mining]{.mark} [leading to]{.mark} the [**development** of **sustainable
outcomes**]{.mark}, is a legitimate concept]{.underline} that we should
be working towards. [[Sustainability]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[mining]{.underline}]{.mark} industry
[can be **[multifaceted]{.mark}**]{.underline}, encompassing
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} which [aim to]{.underline} not only
[[reduce]{.mark} the [environmental and social impacts]{.mark} of mining
[through **stewardship**]{.mark} of the natural environment]{.underline}
but [to]{.underline} also [add **value**, [creating something
**sustainable** in the **long term**]{.mark}. Sustainable
goals]{.underline} must also [include]{.underline} the [development
of]{.underline}, and continued effort towards, building [long-term
relationships with communities]{.underline} who are [**impacted**
by]{.underline} the [mining]{.underline} process. [Ensuring]{.underline}
that [mining is sustainable]{.underline} is not just reliant upon
ethical extraction but also [protecting]{.underline} the [long value
chain that occurs after the mining has taken place]{.underline}. This
process creates environmental, social, and economic value which can
positively benefit the local communities.

For example, [**despite** being built on **environmental disaster**,
[Faro mine in Canada]{.mark} is [now home to]{.mark} the [Faro]{.mark}
[Mine]{.mark} Remediation [Project]{.mark}, a government and
Indigenous-led program]{.underline}. This program provides employment
and training opportunities for Kaska and other Indigenous citizens (FARO
Mine Remediation Project, 2022) and is an example of a long-term project
which provides opportunities for locals whilst at the same time
rehabilitating the environment. Incorporating sustainability principles
into the lifecycle of a mining operation and beyond, has the potential
to have a positive impact on communities and, if incorporated into the
early planning stages, could contribute to the long-term sustainability
of the local area.

These [[questions]{.mark} are]{.underline} also [particularly
[**pertinent** in **Greenland**]{.mark}, a country
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} 92% Indigenous population, [a **great
potential** for [mineral resources]{.mark}, a **large expanse** of
[unexplored land and]{.mark} a **[limited]{.mark}** history of resource
[development]{.mark}]{.underline} (In 2020 there were 2 active mines in
Greenland compared to 1001 in Canada). Despite the small number of mines
in Greenland, some areas (such as in South Greenland) have been mined
for more than a century and a [significant proportion of the [population
of Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} have some experience of exploration
and mining operations and [are [positive towards
mining]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Agneman, 2018; Thaarup et al., 2020).
As Greenland continues to be explored, [[coastal
regions]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[becoming more]{.mark} and more
**[prospective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the [number]{.underline} of
**[[exploration licences]{.underline}]{.mark}** is slowly
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The government and people of Greenland are currently battling with
questions of environmental, economic, and political opportunities. For
example, the controversial [[Kvanefjeld]{.mark} rare earth
[deposit]{.mark}]{.underline} is one of the most significant rare earth
deposits globally and [presents an [opportunity for Greenland to
become]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[internationally
significant]{.underline}]{.mark}** supplier of raw materials and perhaps
establish economic independence from Denmark. Many [[local residents
support the project]{.mark} as [it offers **greater
employment**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}whereas other have raised
concerns about disruptions to the environment and the lack of adequate
information, particularly surrounding the potential radioactive
pollution, and failure to consult and seek local community's free, prior
and informed consent (FPIC) (Orellana et al., 2021). It should be noted,
however, that [the main concerns around the **Kvanefjeld** deposit are
related to the presence of **uranium** in the ore]{.underline}. This is
[not reflective of the "typical" concerns to other exploration and
mining operations elsewhere]{.underline} in Greenland,
[many]{.underline} of which [are seen]{.underline} largely
**[positively]{.underline}**. A recent report on sand mining in
Greenland surveyed almost 1,000 Greenlanders (\>1.5% of the population)
and found that large majorities support extraction but oppose foreign
involvement (Bendixen et al., 2022).

Greenland's Part in the Picture

As part of its plan to reduce rare earth dependency, the EU has been
seeking to establish mining projects within the bloc itself. Various
economically exploitable deposits have been found within the EU's
borders. Most recently, mining company LKAB announced that it had found
a deposit of over 1 million tons of rare earth oxides in northern
Sweden. Other areas in Southern Europe, such as the Balkans, may also
contain considerable resources, but remain largely underexplored at
present.

Here, [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} enters the picture. The largest
island in the world is not part of the EU per se. It joined the European
Community with Denmark in 1973 but chose to leave after a dispute
regarding fishing quotas just over a decade later. It is still, however,
a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories Association of the
EU.

The island [[holds **significant reserves**]{.underline}]{.mark} of
these materials, believed to amount to [[1.5 million
tonnes]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to a report by the European
Commission's Joint Research Centre, Greenland's reserves [make
up]{.underline} almost [[20 percent of]{.mark} the [available]{.mark}
[reserves]{.mark} and]{.underline} nearly [10 percent of the overall
global resources.]{.underline} It has been suggested that its potential
[[world-class]{.mark}s]{.underline} deposits could be [capable of
[meeting **25 percent** of current global r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth[s
demand]{.mark}]{.underline}. Located in southern Greenland, the
Kvanefjeld mining project, one of the largest rare earths deposits in
the world, has particular potential to become a [[globally significant
supplier]{.mark} of rare earths [for many
**decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It is therefore no surprise that the EU has been eyeing Greenland as a
possible piece of the puzzle when it comes to reducing EU dependence on
rare earths imported from beyond the Union's borders. When the island
was granted increased self-governance in 2009, it was agreed that issues
of national security would fall to Denmark, whereas resource
exploitation would be under the remit of the Greenlandic authorities.

What this meant for mining activities on the island was that Denmark
effectively retained the power to make decisions on uranium mining,
whereas rare earths fell to Greenland. Many members of the Greenlandic
political establishment saw the mining projects as an opportunity for
job creation, economic development, and even a stepping stone on the
path to independence from Denmark.

Major [[ice loss from Greenland]{.mark} is [exposing]{.mark} the
island's natural resources]{.underline}, inadvertently making some of
the world's largest untapped **[[critical mineral reserves]{.mark} more
accessible.]{.underline}**

[Greenland]{.underline}, a vast but sparsely populated island situated
between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, has been [transformed by
the climate crisis in recent decades]{.underline}.

A major analysis of historic satellite images, published last year by
researchers at the U.K.'s University of Leeds, showed that the
autonomous Danish territory is turning increasingly green due to
human-caused global warming.

The [[changing environment]{.mark} has seen parts of Greenland's [ice
sheet and glaciers replaced by wetlands]{.mark}, areas of shrub and
barren rock.]{.underline}

Scientists have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the melting snow and
ice on the island, warning the loss of ice mass risks increased
greenhouse gas emissions and rising sea levels.

[For mining companies]{.underline}, Greenland's [[ice retreat]{.mark}
could [facilitate]{.mark} the start of a [mineral]{.mark}]{.underline}
"[[gold rush]{.underline}]{.mark}."

"What's happening now is interesting because the [waters around
Greenland are opening up earlier and earlier each year and closing down
later and later each year]{.underline}. And the ability to get into
these far-flung places is a lot easier than it was 20, 30, 40 or 70
years ago," Roderick McIllree, executive director of U.K.-based mining
company 80 Mile, told CNBC via video call.

"Now, the ice probably only really forms for three or four months in the
very northern latitudes and the rest of the country is seeing receding
ice caps that is exposing rocks and potential mineral deposits that
haven't been seen before," he added.

80 Mile currently has three [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} it is
**[[actively developing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Greenland, including a
[[large oil concession]{.underline}]{.mark} on the island's east coast,
a [[titanium project]{.underline}]{.mark} near the U.S. Pituffik Space
Base in the northwest and its [[D]{.mark}isko-[N]{.mark}uussuaq
[project]{.mark}]{.underline} in the southwest.

Underlining the island's strategic potential as a globally significant
mining hub, McIllree said the firm's Disko project could be one of the
largest occurrences of nickel and copper on the planet.

[Trump]{.underline} has [**[integrated]{.mark}** them [into]{.mark} key
[foreign policy]{.mark} discussions]{.underline}, including those
[[involving Ukraine, Greenland]{.mark}, and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
His first [state [visit to Saudi]{.mark} Arabia resulted in the
[signing]{.mark} of a [memorandum of **cooperation** on **critical
minerals**]{.mark}, alongside]{.underline} a memorandum of
[understanding]{.underline} between U.S.-based MP Materials and Saudi
Arabia's Ma'aden [to advance a complete mine-to-magnet rare earth
**supply chain**]{.underline}.

[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark} will be an
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark} ally [[in **reducing reliance**]{.mark}
on China]{.underline}. Australia is currently the [world's
[fourth-largest]{.mark} [producer]{.mark} of rare earth
elements]{.underline} and is actively [expanding]{.underline} its
[domestic processing capabilities]{.underline}. Among the key projects
is Iluka Resources' Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery in Western Australia,
supported by a \$1.25 billion government loan. The facility will produce
separated rare earth oxides---including neodymium, praseodymium,
dysprosium, and terbium---and is scheduled to begin operations next
year. Another major development is Arafura Rare Earths Limited's Nolans
Project, which has secured \$840 million in federal funding and is
projected to supply 4 percent of the global demand for neodymium and
praseodymium starting in 2032. Overall, [[Australia]{.mark} is [on track
to **triple**]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[output]{.underline}]{.mark} of
mined rare earth oxides between 2025 and 2027.

[development of U.S. mineral projects]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
invoking the Defense Production Act (DPA) [to prioritize and fund the
mining and processing of critical minerals on public lands]{.underline}.
Currently, there is [no heavy rare earth separation capacity in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, though efforts to build this
capability are underway. The Department of Defense (DOD), in its 2024
National Defense Industrial Strategy, set a target to establish a fully
integrated mine-to-magnet rare earth supply chain capable of meeting all
U.S. defense requirements by 2027. Since 2020, the DOD has invested over
\$439 million to strengthen domestic supply chains. This includes a
\$9.6 million award to MP Materials in 2020 under the DPA Title III
program to develop a light rare earth separation facility at Mountain
Pass, California, followed by a \$35 million award in 2022 for a heavy
rare earth processing facility. These would be the first fully
integrated rare earth facilities in the United States, spanning mining
and separation at Mountain Pass to refining and magnet manufacturing in
Fort Worth, Texas. However, even once operational, [MP Materials is
projected to produce only 1,000 tons of neodymium-iron-boron magnets

Major [[ice loss from Greenland]{.mark} is [exposing]{.mark} the
island's natural resources]{.underline}, inadvertently making some of
the world's largest untapped **[[critical mineral reserves]{.mark} more
accessible.]{.underline}**

[Greenland]{.underline}, a vast but sparsely populated island situated
between the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, has been [transformed by
the climate crisis in recent decades]{.underline}.

A major analysis of historic satellite images, published last year by
researchers at the U.K.'s University of Leeds, showed that the
autonomous Danish territory is turning increasingly green due to
human-caused global warming.

The [[changing environment]{.mark} has seen parts of Greenland's [ice
sheet and glaciers replaced by wetlands]{.mark}, areas of shrub and
barren rock.]{.underline}

Scientists have repeatedly sounded the alarm over the melting snow and
ice on the island, warning the loss of ice mass risks increased
greenhouse gas emissions and rising sea levels.

[For mining companies]{.underline}, Greenland's [[ice retreat]{.mark}
could [facilitate]{.mark} the start of a [mineral]{.mark}]{.underline}
"[[gold rush]{.underline}]{.mark}."

"What's happening now is interesting because the [waters around
Greenland are opening up earlier and earlier each year and closing down
later and later each year]{.underline}. And the ability to get into
these far-flung places is a lot easier than it was 20, 30, 40 or 70
years ago," Roderick McIllree, executive director of U.K.-based mining
company 80 Mile, told CNBC via video call.

"Now, the ice probably only really forms for three or four months in the
very northern latitudes and the rest of the country is seeing receding
ice caps that is exposing rocks and potential mineral deposits that
haven't been seen before," he added.

80 Mile currently has three [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} it is
**[[actively developing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Greenland, including a
[[large oil concession]{.underline}]{.mark} on the island's east coast,
a [[titanium project]{.underline}]{.mark} near the U.S. Pituffik Space
Base in the northwest and its [[D]{.mark}isko-[N]{.mark}uussuaq
[project]{.mark}]{.underline} in the southwest.

Underlining the island's strategic potential as a globally significant
mining hub, McIllree said the firm's Disko project could be one of the
largest occurrences of nickel and copper on the planet.

The Geopolitics of Greenland

The [push to unlock [Greenland\'s rare earth
deposits]{.mark}]{.underline} is [playing out [against a **complex
backdrop**]{.mark}]{.underline} of international relations. Denmark
provides about \$500 million annually to Greenland---more than \$8,000
per resident---making the world\'s largest island heavily dependent on
Danish support.

However, this hasn\'t stopped [other [global powers]{.mark}]{.underline}
from [[eyeing]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[strategic
value]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Trump has revived interest in acquiring
the territory, with his Republican allies in Congress working to
authorize negotiations with Denmark.

But [Greenland\'s value]{.underline} extends far [**[beyond]{.mark}**
its [mineral wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[island\'s location
along]{.mark} the **[shortest route]{.mark}** [between Europe and
N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}merica]{.underline} makes it [[crucial for U.S.
**military interests**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [for
**[ballistic]{.mark} [missile warning]{.mark}**
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. already maintains a permanent
presence at Pituffik air base in northwest Greenland under a 1951
agreement with Denmark and has previously looked to expand its military
footprint to monitor Russian naval activities in the waters between
Greenland, Iceland, and Britain.

While [Greenlandic Prime Minister]{.underline} Mute Egede has
[emphasized]{.underline} that \"[Greenland is not for
sale]{.underline},\" a 2023 survey revealed that [Greenland possesses 25
of the 34]{.underline} minerals the European Commission deems
\"[critical raw materials]{.underline}.\"

This has led to [competing interests from **multiple powers**: [China

270 billion tons of frozen water each year as winter snowfall failed to

contributor of sea level rise globally, which is now at a quarter of an

[[Recycling]{.underline}]{.mark} could **[[significantly

a process]{.underline} that is [riddled with [human rights and
environmental concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the reliance on
open pit mines in developing countries. Even beyond those worries, the
Earth contains a finite source of minerals, and skyrocketing demand will
squeeze supplies. The world currently extracts about 180,000 metric tons
of lithium each year --- and demand is expected to hit nearly 10 times
that by 2050, as adoption of electric vehicles, battery storage, and
other technology needed for a green transition surges. At those levels,
there are only enough known reserves to last about 15 years. The

Are Rare Earth Elements Sustainable?

[Given]{.underline} the [**demand** for REEs]{.underline}, the question
is, [how can we recycle products that contain REEs to make
this]{.underline} a **[more sustainable]{.underline}** practice?

With hundreds of thousands of tonnes of REE-containing products being
produced each year, [[recycling]{.underline}]{.mark} [remains the
**[most]{.mark} [sustainable]{.mark}** [strategy to reduce **primary
demand**]{.mark}. Recycling]{.underline} not only helps in
**[[conserving]{.underline}]{.mark}** these [[critical]{.mark}
[materials]{.mark}]{.underline} but also [[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[environmental impact]{.mark} associated [with **mining** and
**processing**]{.mark} new REEs]{.underline}.

Opportunities in Battery Recycling

[Recycling metals from end-of-life batteries]{.underline} presents a
significant opportunity to **[[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[demand for battery]{.mark} [metals]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
cobalt, lithium, nickel, and manganese. For instance, the recycling of
lithium-ion batteries can [[recover]{.mark} [valuable
materials]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [[**essential** for]{.mark}
manufacturing [new batteries]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[process]{.underline} not only [[conserves]{.mark}
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} but also
**[[mitigates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[environmental hazards]{.mark}
posed [by **battery disposal**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

An ideal solution to reduce the demand for REEs in wind power and
electric vehicle (EV) markets is to [reuse and recycle [existing
rare-earth magnets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Retired [[wind
turbines]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[EV motors]{.underline}]{.mark} are
[[excellent sources for recycled REEs]{.underline}]{.mark} because their
[magnets are]{.underline} relatively **[large]{.underline}** and can be
recovered with ease. In some cases, large magnets can be reused directly
without undergoing the recycling process.

Many [[EV and battery manufacturers]{.mark} have been [**proactive** in
establishing **recycling**]{.mark} **initiatives**]{.underline} and
[[improving]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**efficiency** of battery
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, companies like [[Tesla
and BMW]{.underline}]{.mark} are [investing in closed-loop recycling
systems to [**recover** REEs]{.mark}]{.underline} and other critical
materials from used batteries. These [initiatives are **crucial** for
creating a **sustainable** supply chain and reducing reliance on new
mining.]{.underline}

### Minerals\-\--U\-\--Mining\-\--AT: Recycling\-\--2NC

Published April 22^nd^, 2024, Accessed July 27^th^, 2025 // ajap\]

[[For other]{.mark} energy transition [metals, recycling rates are **far
lower**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Take the rare-earth element
**[[neodymium]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which is [[used in]{.mark} the
permanent **[magnets]{.mark}**]{.underline} found [in everything from
iPhone speakers to]{.underline} **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**lectric
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle [[motors]{.mark} to offshore [wind
turbine generators]{.mark}]{.underline}. Worldwide, Baldé and his
colleagues estimated there were [[7,248 metric tons of]{.mark}
[neodymium]{.mark} locked away [in e-waste]{.mark} in
2022]{.underline}---roughly [[**three-quarters** of]{.mark} the
9,768]{.underline} metric [tons]{.underline} of neodymium the wind and
EV sectors [[required]{.underline}]{.mark} that year, per the IEA. Yet
[[**less than 1 percent** of]{.mark} all [rare earths in e-waste
are]{.mark} [recycled due to]{.mark} the [**immaturity** of]{.mark} the
underlying [recycling technologies]{.mark}, as well as]{.underline} the
[[**cost** and]{.mark} [**logistical** challenges of
**collecting**]{.mark}]{.underline} rare earth-rich [[components from
technology]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"It's a lot of [[**hassle** to collect and separate]{.underline}]{.mark}
out" [[rare-earth magnets for recycling]{.underline}]{.mark}, Baldé
said. Despite the EV and wind energy sectors' fast-growing rare-earth
needs, "there is [[**no push** from the market or legislators]{.mark} to
recover them.]{.underline}"

The metals present in e-waste aren't necessarily useful for every
climate tech application even when they are recycled. Take nickel. The
lithium-ion batteries inside electric vehicles gobble up huge amounts of
the stuff---over 300,000 metric tons in 2022. The amount of nickel
required for EVs could rise tenfold by 2050, according to the IEA. But
while the world's e-waste contained more than half a million metric tons
of nickel in 2022, most of it was inside alloys like stainless steel.
Rather than getting separated out, that nickel gets "recycled into other
steel products," said Kwasi Ampofo, the lead metals and mining analyst
at energy consultancy BloombergNEF. [Some of that recycled steel could
wind up in wind turbines and other]{.underline} zero-emissions
[technologies. But [it won't **directly**]{.mark} help to [fill the
**much larger**]{.mark} [**nickel demands** of the EV battery
market]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It's not just rare earths, as my colleague Max Bearak and I reported
this week. [[China supplies]{.underline}]{.mark} more than [[**half**
of]{.mark} the 50 [minerals]{.mark} the U.S. government has [deemed
**critical** to national **security** and the
**economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Among those critical minerals are [[lithium]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[cobalt]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[nickel]{.underline}]{.mark},
components of the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles
and store energy on the grid when the weather is unfavorable for wind
and solar generation. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} refines or [[mines
**significant**]{.mark} **[portions]{.mark}** of the world's supply of
**all three**]{.underline}, and Chinese companies have acquired major
stakes in mineral-rich countries: [nickel in Indonesia, cobalt
in]{.underline} the Democratic Republic of [Congo, lithium in
Zimbabwe]{.underline}.

"[China's influence]{.underline} over critical mineral supply chains is
[**far greater** than trade data]{.underline} alone
[suggests]{.underline}," said Krista Rasmussen, director of natural
resource security at C4ADS, a research organization based in Washington
that has traced Chinese companies' hidden ownership of Indonesian nickel
refineries. "Chinese [[firms exert substantial control across]{.mark}
nearly [**every stage** of the]{.mark} [supply
chain]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Some critical minerals are far more abundant than rare earths, and
[American mining companies have been engaged for **years** in
extracting]{.underline} them domestically and around the world, though
[at a **fraction** of the **scale** of Chinese companies]{.underline}.

Mr. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has sought to
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** American [access to]{.underline}
certain [[critical minerals through **deals**]{.underline}]{.mark} with
Ukraine and Congo, and [there are deposits in Canada and
Greenland]{.underline}, two places he has mused about annexing.

[[Rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[have
**narrower** supply chains]{.mark} and are]{.underline} often [**more
difficult** to extract]{.underline}, requiring more cumbersome processes
to separate them from other minerals (as Lecoq de Boisbaudran learned).
The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline} just
[**one operational** rare earth mine]{.underline}, in Mountain Pass,
Calif., [which produces around **15 percent** of global rare
earths]{.underline}.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} rare earths export [[ban applies to **all
countries**]{.mark}, not just the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [meaning the [U.S. will]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[be]{.mark} **[unable to acquire]{.mark}** the [banned commodities
through **intermediaries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S.
[companies]{.underline} have [stockpiled]{.underline} rare earth
inventories that can tide them over, [but they will **not last
forever**]{.underline}, said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond
James who specializes in the mineral trade.

Q2: What is the significance of the focus on heavy rare earths given
U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities?

A2: The [[restrictions]{.mark} apply to [**seven** medium and heavy rare
earths]{.mark}]{.underline}: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,
lutetium, scandium, and yttrium. The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [is]{.underline} particularly
[[**vulnerable** for]{.mark} these [supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Until 2023, [[China]{.mark} accounted for [**99 percent** of global
**heavy** REEs]{.mark}]{.underline} processing, with only minimal output
from a refinery in Vietnam. However, that facility has been shut down
for the past year due to a tax dispute, effectively [giving China a
[**monopoly** over supply]{.mark}]{.underline}. China did not impose
restrictions on light rare earths, for which a more diverse set of
countries undertake processing.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[used]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rare
earths]{.mark} market [as an **economic** and **political**
weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}. In [[2010]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
so-called [Rare Earths Trade Dispute]{.underline} broke out, [when
[China **refused to ship**]{.mark} the [minerals to
**Japan**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [a country famous for its
**manufacturing** of technologies]{.underline}. (However, some
[researchers question whether this was]{.underline} a
**[deliberate]{.underline}** embargo or a Chinese effort to reduce rare
earth exports generally.) More subtly, [[China can
**manipulate**]{.mark} the [market]{.mark} on rare earths
by]{.underline}, say, [increasing **production** [to drive down
prices]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[makes it less economically
**feasible** for **other mining outfits**]{.mark} to get into the game,
[given]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**cost** and **difficulty**]{.mark} of
extracting]{.underline} the [minerals, **[solidifying]{.mark}** [China's
**grip**]{.mark} on rare earths]{.underline}.

"[[They control **every stage**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the
[[mining]{.underline}]{.mark} of it, and then the [intermediate
[processing]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} then the more
[sophisticated final product processing]{.underline}," said Heather
Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources, and environment at
the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a think tank in Canada. "So [[they can
intervene]{.mark} in the market [at **all**]{.mark} these
**[levels]{.mark}**.]{.underline}"

This is a [[**precarious monopoly** for West]{.mark}ern economies and
governments [to navigate. Military aircraft and]{.mark} [drones

[[**relies** on rare]{.mark} [earths]{.mark}, as do [**flatscreens** and

but **modern life itself**]{.underline}.

China: tightening the reins

The media often characterize the PRC's rare earths dominance as the
"trump card" of wolf warrior diplomacy, but Xi Jinping likely
understands that the implicit threat of applying this leverage outweighs
the cost-benefit of its actual use.

The [[international environment of today]{.mark} is **far [less
forgiving]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} that of [2010]{.mark}]{.underline},
and [a rare earths embargo]{.underline} applied tomorrow on a nation
like Japan or the United States [would easily spark a **bellicose trade
dispute** and push a tsunami of funding toward emerging
**competitors**.]{.underline}

However, there exists a [dangerous window during the next several
years]{.underline}, when [the [PRC's influence]{.mark} over the global
industry is **diminishing** but still [**overwhelming** enough to put
importing nations in a **bind**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this sense,
[[Beijing]{.mark} could still use its "[trump card]{.mark}" over a
**critical political moment**]{.underline} -- something that would
become even more tempting once its monopoly's decline started to seem
inevitable.

Beijing's cognizance of this scenario is reflected in its recent merger
of three state-owned mining giants into the [China Rare Earth
Group]{.underline}. This massive consolidation [allows the party
to]{.underline} more easily [control the market]{.underline} and develop
synergies [to bring costs **even lower**, which will **hamper** foreign
upstarts.]{.underline}

Realist conclusions in a global market-based system

In the long run, [monopolistic behavior will be solved by the
interconnected markets on which modern society is built.]{.underline}

The strategic calculus and narratives between great powers may be
swiftly changing, but the fundamental rules of the game remain. The more
likely the world perceives the weaponization of the rare earths industry
by Beijing, the more pressure will be applied on the two competitive
market forces already working towards solutions.

The first is the potential for new market entrants. [Rising Chinese
[**export tariffs** and **spiking prices** signal
**opportunity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada, India, and the United
Kingdom have all recently announced their intent to develop their first
domestic refineries for rare earth elements, with [[national security
interests]{.mark} undoubtedly [providing
propulsion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Relatively small investments now could pay off big by shaking up market
dynamics later this decade, so [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [could [seed]{.mark} **promising [ventures
abroad]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and consider this high-profile sector an
opportunity to build up "friendshoring" partnerships with alternate
producers.

#### [Overdependence]{.underline} causes [Taiwan invasion]{.underline}.

Aside from pressing into the two competitive market forces of new
entrants and substitution, [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should continue]{.mark}
**[subsidizing]{.mark}**]{.underline} the rapid [[development of]{.mark}
its [rare earths supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly the
midstream layers: ore processing, mineral refining, and alloying.

Rare-Earth Mine in National Elections,"
https://www.courthousenews.com/greenland-rejects-huge-rare-earth-mine-in-national-elections/\]

On Wednesday, election results showed Inuit Ataqatigiit, a left-wing
environmental party, winning Tuesday\'s snap election with about 37% of
the vote. The election for Greenland\'s tiny 31-seat parliament garnered
international attention because [it carried **geopolitical
implications**]{.underline}.

[[Greenland is]{.mark} seen as [a]{.mark} potential [**major source**
for **r**]{.mark}**are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements**, a market now
[**dominated** by China]{.mark}]{.underline}, which accounts for
two-thirds of rare earth mining and about 90% of global production.
[Rare earth elements are a set of 17 [soft]{.mark} heavy
[metals]{.mark}, such as neodymium and scandium, [that go into]{.mark}
the making of]{.underline} smartphones, lasers, electric cars, wind
turbines and [[**military hardware** such as]{.mark} the **[F-35]{.mark}
fighter jet**]{.underline}.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
and its allies [are seeking to develop alternative sources from China
and [are **eying Greenland** as a]{.mark} **potential
[trove]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2019, former U.S. President Donald
Trump even proposed buying Greenland, but his offer was rejected.
Greenland is an autonomous and unspoiled massive Arctic island three
times the size of Texas. It is part of Denmark with about 56,000
inhabitants.

The election served as a referendum on a 15-year-long effort by
Greenland Minerals, an Australian company, to develop a mining complex
at Kuannersuit, one of the world\'s largest deposits of rare earth
metals and uranium. The project became more controversial after a
Chinese firm partly owned by the Chinese government, rare-earth giant
Shenghe Resources, became the main investor.

Kuannersuit (known also by its Danish name Kvanefjeld) is located next
to a fishing town in southern Greenland, where contamination fears have
driven opposition to the mine. Locals worry the mine would transform the
tranquil town of Narsaq into an industrial hub contaminated by
radioactive dust.

Greenland\'s government, led by the social democratic Siumut party,
supported the project and argued it would become a windfall allowing
Greenland to cut ties with Denmark and become independent. Denmark,
which does not oppose Greenland\'s independence, sends about \$625
million in subsidies to the island, accounting for up to half of its
budget.

Tuesday\'s snap election was brought about by disagreements between
Greenland\'s politicians over the mine and accusations that it was being
fast tracked without public hearings.

By backing the opposition Inuit Ataqatigiit, the mine seems doomed. The
left-green Inuit Ataqatigiit campaigned against it and backs a
moratorium on uranium mining. It also has pledged to join the Paris
climate agreement, a move that could preclude Greenland from developing
rare earth mines.

"Now it will be distinctly uphill for the large and controversial mining
projects," said Carl Bildt, the co-chair of the European Council on
Foreign Relations and a former Swedish prime minsiter, on Twitter.

Instead of mining, Inuit Ataqatigiit advocates fishing and tourism as
the best fit for Greenland\'s future development. About 90% of
Greenland\'s population is made up of Inuits, many of whom fish for a
living.

However, Inuit Ataqatigiit has not ruled out mining in other locations.
It is expected to form a coalition government with smaller parties.

Siumut won about 29% of the vote, marking a turning point in
Greenland\'s politics. Siumut has ruled the island almost without
interruption since 1979 when Greenland\'s parliament --- known as the
Inatsisartut --- was established as part of the Danish territory\'s
autonomy.

[In recent years, [Greenland]{.mark} has [approved]{.mark} numerous
[mining]{.mark} exploration [licenses]{.mark}. Scientists say **[many

THE UNITED STATES AS AN AEROSPACE NATION: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

In his address opening the conference, General Norton A. Schwartz, Chief
of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF), pointed out how, [[with]{.mark} its
inherent characteristics of [**speed**, **range**, and **flexibility**,
airpower]{.mark} has forever changed warfare]{.underline}. Its advent
rendered land and maritime forces vulnerable from the air, thus adding
an important new dimension to warfare. [Control of the air [has become
**indispensable**]{.mark} to national security because it allows the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and friendly forces to
maneuver and operate free from enemy air attack. With control of the air
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can leverage the
advantages of air and space as well as cyberspace. In these
interdependent domains the [Air Force possesses unique]{.mark}
capabilities for ensuring [**global mobility**, **long-range strike**,
and]{.mark} intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(**[ISR]{.mark}**). The benefits of airpower **extend beyond** the air
domain, and operations among the [air, land, maritime]{.mark}, space,
[and cyber]{.mark} domains [are]{.mark} **increasingly
[interdependent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

General Schwartz stated that the Air Force's challenge is to succeed in
a protracted struggle against elements of violent extremism and
irreconcilable actors while confronting peer and near-peer rivals. The
Air Force must be able to operate with great precision and lethality
across a broad spectrum of conflict that has high and low ends but that
defies an orderly taxonomy. Warfare in the twenty-first century takes on
a hybrid complexity, with regular and irregular elements using myriad
tools and tactics. Technology can be an enabler but can also create
weaknesses: adversaries with increased access to space and cyberspace
can use emerging technologies against the United States and/or its
allies. In addition, the United States faces the prospect of the
proliferation of precision weapons, including ballistic and cruise
missiles as well as increasingly accurate mortars, rockets, and
artillery, which will put U.S. and allied/coalition forces at risk. In
response to mounting irregular warfare challenges American leaders have
to adopt innovative and creative strategies. For its part, the USAF must
develop airmen who have the creativity to anticipate and plan for this
challenging environment. Leadership, intellectual creativity, capacity,
and ingenuity, together with innovative technology, will be crucial to
addressing these challenges in a constrained fiscal environment.

System Versatility

In meeting the broad range of contingencies -- high, low, regular,
irregular, and hybrid -- the Air Force must maintain and develop systems
that are versatile, both functionally (including strike or ISR) and in
terms of various employment modes, such as manned versus remotely
piloted, and penetrating versus stand-off systems. General Schwartz
emphasized the need to be able to operate in conflict settings where
there will be demands for persistent ISR systems able to gain access to,
and then loiter in, contested or denied airspace. The targets to be
identified and tracked may be mobile or deeply buried, of high value,
and difficult to locate without penetrating systems. General Schwartz
also called attention to the need for what he described as a "family of
systems" that could be deployed in multiple ways with maximum
versatility depending on requirements. Few systems will remain
inherently single purpose. Indeed, he emphasized that the Air Force must
purposefully design versatility into its new systems, with the majority
of future systems being able to operate in various threat environments.
As part of this effort further joint integration and inter-service
cooperation to achieve greater air-land and air-sea interoperability
will continue to be a strategic necessity.

Space Access and Control

Space access, control, and situational awareness remain essential to
U.S. national security. As potential rivals develop their own space
programs, the United States faces challenges to its unrestricted access
to space. Ensuring continuing access to the four global commons --
maritime, air, space, and cyberspace -- will be a major challenge in
which the USAF has a key role. The Air Force has long recognized the
importance of space and is endeavoring to make certain that U.S.
requirements in and for space are met and anticipated. Space situational
awareness is vital to America's ability to help evaluate and attribute
attacks. Attribution, of course, is essential to deterrence. The USAF is
exploring options to reduce U.S. dependence on the Global Positioning
System (GPS), which could become vulnerable to jamming. Promising new
technologies, such as "cold atoms," pseudolites, and imaging inertial
navigation systems that use laser radar are being investigated as means
to reduce our vulnerability.

Cyber Capabilities

The USAF continues to develop cyber capabilities to address
opportunities and challenges. Cyber threats present challenges to
homeland security and other national security interests. Key civilian
and military networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Preparing for
cyber warfare and refining critical infrastructure protection and
consequence management will require new capabilities, focused training,
and greater interagency, international, and private sector
collaboration.

Challenges for the Air Force

General Schwartz set forth a series of challenges for the Air Force,
which he urged conference participants to address. They included:

• How can the Air Force better address the growing demand for real-time
ISR from remotely piloted systems, which are providing unprecedented and
unmatched situational awareness?

• How can the USAF better guarantee the credibility and viability of the
nation's nuclear forces for the complex and uncertain security
environment of this century?

• What is the way ahead for the next generation of long-range strike and
ISR platforms? What trade-offs, especially between manned and unmanned
platforms, should the USAF consider? How can the USAF improve
acquisition of such systems? How can the USAF better exploit the
advantage of low-observables?

• How can the Air Force better prepare itself to operate in an opposed
network environment in which communications and data links will be
challenged, including how to assure command and control (C2) in
bandwidth-constrained environments?

• In counter-land operations, how can the USAF achieve improved target
discrimination in high collateral damage situations?

• How should the USAF posture its overseas forces to ensure access? What
basing structure, logistical considerations, andprotection measures are
required to mitigate emerging anti-access threats?

• How can the Air Force reduce its reliance on GPS to ensure operations
in a GPS-denied environment?

• How can the USAF lessen its vulnerability to petroleum shortages,
rising energy prices, and resulting logistical and operational
challenges?

• How can the Air Force enhance partnerships with its sister services
and the interagency community? How can it better collaborate with allies
and coalition partners to improve support of national security
interests?

These issues were addressed in subsequent conference sessions. The
opening session focused on the multidimensional and dynamic security
setting in which the Air Force will operate in the years ahead. The
session included a discussion of the need to prioritize necessary
capabilities and to gauge "acceptable risks." Previous Quadrennial
Defense Reviews (QDRs) rested on the basic assumption that the United
States would be able to support operations simultaneously or nearly
simultaneously in two major regional contingencies, with the additional
capacity to respond to smaller disaster-relief and/or stability
operations missions. However, while the 2010 QDR1 maintains the need for
U.S. forces to operate in two nearly simultaneous major wars, it places
far greater emphasis on the need to address irregular warfare
challenges. Its focus is maintaining and rebalancing U.S. force
structure to fight the wars in which the United States is engaged today
while looking ahead to the emerging security setting. The

QDR further seeks to develop flexible and tailored capabilities to
confront an array of smaller-scale contingencies, including natural
disasters, perhaps simultaneously, as was the case with the war in
Afghanistan, stability operations in Iraq, and the Haiti relief effort.

The 2010 QDR highlights important trends in the global security
environment, especially unconventional threats and asymmetric
challenges. It suggests that a conflict with a near-peer competitor such
as China, or a conflict with Iran, would involve a mix, or hybrid, of
capabilities that would test U.S. forces in very different ways.
Although predicting the future security setting is a very difficult if
not an impossible exercise, the 2010 QDR outlines major challenges for
the United States and its allies, including technology proliferation and
diffusion; anti-access threats and the shrinking global basing
infrastructure; the possibility of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) use
against the U.S. homeland and/or against U.S. forces abroad; critical
infrastructure protection and the massed effects of a cyber or space
attack; unconventional warfare and irregular challenges; and the
emergence of new issue areas such as Arctic security, U.S. energy
dependence, demographic shifts and urbanization, the potential for
resource wars (particularly over access to water), and the erosion or
collapse of governance in weak or failing states.

TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION

Technology proliferation is accelerating. Compounding the problem is the
reality that existing multilateral and/or international export regimes
and controls have not kept pace with technology, and efforts to
constrain access are complicated by dual-use technologies and
chemical/biological agents. The battlefields of the future are likely to
be more lethal as combatants take advantage of commercially based
navigation aids for precision guidance and advanced weapons systems and
as global and theater boundaries disappear with longer-range missile
systems becoming more common in enemy arsenals. Non-state entities such
as Hezbollah have already used more advanced missile systems to target
state adversaries. The proliferation of precision technologies and
longer-range delivery platforms puts the United States and its partners
increasingly at risk. This proliferation also is likely to affect U.S.
operations from forward operating locations, placing additional
constraints on American force deployments within the territories of
allies. Moreover, as longer-range ballistic and cruise missiles become
more widespread, U.S. forces will find it increasingly difficult to
operate in conflicts ranging from irregular warfare to high-intensity
combat. As highlighted throughout the conference, this will require that
the United States develop and field new-generation low-observable
penetration assets and related capabilities to operate in non-permissive
environments.

PROLIFERATION TRENDS

The twenty-first-century security setting features several proliferation
trends that were discussed in the opening session. These trends, six of
which were outlined by Dr. Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, Jr., President of the
Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis, and Shelby Cullom Davis Professor
of International Security Studies, The Fletcher School, Tufts
University, framed subsequent discussions.

First, the number of actors--states and armed non-state groups--is
growing, together with strategies and capabilities based on more widely
available technologies, including WMD and conventional weapons. This is
leading to a blurring of categories of warfare that may include state
and non-state actors and encompass intra-state, trans-state, and
inter-state armed conflict as well as hybrid threats.

Second, some of these actors subscribe to ideologies and goals that
welcome martyrdom. This raises many questions about dissuasion and
deterrence and the need to think of twenty-first-century deterrence
based on offensive and defensive strategies and capabilities.

Third, given the sheer numbers of actors capable of challenging the
United States and their unprecedented capabilities, the opportunity for
asymmetric operations against the United States and its allies will
grow. The United States will need to work to reduce key areas of
vulnerability, including its financial systems, transportation,
communications, and energy infrastructures, its food and water supply,
and its space assets.

Fourth, the twenty-first-century world contains flashpoints for
state-to-state conflict. This includes North Korea, which possesses
nuclear weapons, and Iran, which is developing them. In addition, China
is developing an impressive array of weaponry which, as the Commander of
U.S. Pacific Command stated in congressional testimony, appears
"designed to challenge U.S. freedom of action in the region and, if
necessary, enforce China's influence over its neighbors -- including our
regional allies and partners' weaponry."2 These threats include
ballistic missiles, aircraft, naval forces, cyber capabilities,
anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, and other power-projection capabilities.
The global paradigm of the twenty-first century is further complicated
by state actors who may supply advanced arms to non-state actors and
terrorist organizations.

Fifth, the potential for irregular warfare is rising dramatically with
the growth of armed non-state actors. The proliferation of more lethal
capabilities, including WMD, to armed non-state actors is a logical
projection of present trends. Substantial numbers of fractured,
unstable, and ungoverned states serve as breeding grounds of armed
non-state actors who will resort to various forms of violence and
coercion based on irregular tactics and formations and who will
increasingly have the capabilities to do so.

Sixth, the twenty-first-century security setting contains yet another
obvious dimension: the permeability of the frontiers of the nation
state, rendering domestic populations highly vulnerable to destruction
not only by states that can launch missiles but also by terrorists and
other transnational groups. As we have seen in recent years, these
entities can attack U.S. information systems, creating the possibility
of a digital Pearl Harbor.

Taken together, these trends show an unprecedented proliferation of
actors and advanced capabilities confronting the United States; the
resulting need to prepare for high-end and low-end conflict; and the
requirement to think of a seamless web of threats and other security
challenges extending from overseas to domestic locales.

Another way to think about the twenty-first-century security setting,
Dr. Pfaltzgraff pointed out, is to develop [scenarios]{.underline} such
as the following, which [are]{.underline} more
[illustrative]{.underline} than comprehensive:

• [A **[nuclear Iran]{.mark}** that engages in or supports terrorist
operations in a more assertive foreign policy]{.underline}

• [An **[unstable Pakistan]{.mark}** that loses control of its nuclear
weapons, which fall into the hands of extremists]{.underline}

• [A **[Taiwan]{.mark} Straits** [crisis]{.mark} that escalates to

Rare earth elements [(REEs) are not]{.underline} as [rare]{.underline}
as their name indicates. [However, there [aren't many **mineable**
deposits]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most of the mineable deposits have been
found in China, America, South Africa and Australia. [Currently, [China
produces]{.mark} over [95 per cent of]{.mark} the world's [REE]{.mark}
production and supplies about 97 per cent of the world's
demand]{.underline}. The United States used to be the dominant supplier
prior to the 1980s via the Mountain Pass deposit in California, but
because of environmental issues around the complex production process
and lower market value, the mine was closed in 2000. REEs include the 15
lanthanide elements, plus yttrium and scandium. The lanthanide elements
are normally categorized in two groups:

Light rare earth elements (LREEs), i.e. lanthanum through europium
(atomic number (Z) = 57 through 63)

Heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), i.e. gadolinium through lutetium (Z =
64 through 71)

These two groups are often found together in a rare earth deposit due to
their similar physical and chemical properties.

WHERE ARE RARE EARTHS USED?

REEs have a wide range of applications, including use in catalysts,
phosphors, permanent magnets, batteries, medical devices, electrical and
electronic components, and generators. [[REEs]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[have **important defense applications**, such as]{.underline}]{.mark}
jet fighter engines, [missile **[guidance]{.mark}** systems,
**[anti-missile defense systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, space-based
satellites and communication systems.

[The [versatility]{.mark} and specificity [of]{.mark}]{.underline} rare
earth elements [[(REEs)]{.mark} have [led to]{.mark} their use in an
ever-increasing variety of applications in new technologies.
Consequently, [demand]{.mark} for REEs has increased
significantly]{.underline}. Everybody wants to extract rare earths
because they're so important, but metallurgical processing is
complicated and comes at a high cost.

WHY RARE EARTHS AREN'T CHEAP TO PRODUCE

Over 250 companies outside of China are trying to develop rare earth
element properties. The reality is rare earths are a small volume
commodity -- not like potash or iron ores -- so no major mining
companies are in rare earths because revenues are relatively small.

The processes to produce rare earth elements are complicated, involving
many stages of physical and chemical treatment. The energy and reagent
consumption are high. The treatment of waste gas, water and tailings is
difficult. The cost to produce rare earths is very high, which makes it
difficult for other companies to compete with Chinese producers. China
is able to control the market and the production for several reasons:

They have the largest rare earth resource and the largest rare earth
production mine.

They have a very unique heavy rare earth resource of ionic adsorption
clays.

They have done extensive research and development work for many decades
to process their rare earth resources.

They have more relaxed environmental regulations than other countries.

Powdery rare earth element

[Processing rare earths is]{.underline} much more
**[complicated]{.underline}** than potash or iron ore. Rare earth
deposits are different from area to area with unique characteristics
that make the processing challenging. For example, the process and
reagents that work well for the Chinese deposits don\'t work for those
[[deposits in]{.underline}]{.mark} Canada and
**[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Research and development [[is
**important** to develop]{.mark} a]{.underline} rare earth deposit

#### Extinction\-\--miscalculation [AND]{.underline} nuclear war. 

**Obering and Heinricks '19** \[Henry and Rebeccah; 2019; Executive vice
president and Directed Energy lead at Booz Allen Hamilton and former
director of the Missile Defense Agency + senior fellow @ Hudson
Institute; Air University, "Missile Defense for Great Power Conflict:
Outmaneuvering the China Threat,"
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-13_Issue-4/Heinrichs.pdf\]

Offensive capabilities have many advantages, especially when it comes to
cost. But [the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [must]{.mark} also
**prudently [invest]{.mark}** more heavily [in **missile
d**]{.mark}**efense capabilities**]{.underline} to capitalize on
technological advances that help meet the security dynamics of the
twenty-first century in a way that bolsters deterrence. Missile defense
has a large role to play in deterrence. To be clear, it is not necessary
to create an impenetrable missile defense shield for defenses to be
effective for deterrence. Deterrence by denial requires convincing the
adversary that its odds of successfully achieving a desired outcome are
too low relative to the cost and risk of launching an attack and failing
to achieve the desired military objective. In other words, [missile
defense need only be effective enough to create doubt in the mind of the
adversary about the success of the attack]{.underline}. Of course, [the
more the **[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [can convince
**adversaries**]{.mark} that **[defenses]{.mark} are
[credible]{.mark}**, the more the **[adversary]{.mark}** might
**[hesitate]{.mark} to attack**]{.underline}.

[**[Missile]{.mark} defense** can also **[safeguard]{.mark} critical
[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or at least limit the damage of an
attempted strategic attack so that a counterstrike is possible. In doing
so, it helps to maximize the options for US responses to an attack.
Additionally, a more robust defense of strategic assets would raise the
number of offensive missiles an adversary would need to get through to
its desired target, thereby taking away the "potshot" option, so to
speak. Moreover, unlike offenses, US defenses do not have to tailor
their military impact to proportionality. [**The [stronger]{.mark}**
they are]{.underline}, however, [**[the better]{.mark}**. If deterrence
fails, **missile [defenses]{.mark}** also have value in that they are
**inherently [de-escalat]{.mark}**ory and contribute to **escalation
management**]{.underline} during a conflict. By having the ability to
protect US strategic assets and to limit damage of a potential attack,
strong missile defense also gives the US increased decision time when
determining a retaliatory response. As so aptly stated by Brad Roberts,
director of the Center for Global Security Research at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, "Ballistic missile defense helps to put
the burden of escalation in an emerging crisis onto the adversary, thus
helping to free the US and its allies from escalation decisions that
might seem premature.

[We can imagine a **plausible scenario** in which **[lacking]{.mark}
defenses** [tempts **aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}; if, for
instance, the United States does not have the ability to intercept an
HGV (and currently we do not), China might calculate that it can attack
US assets on Guam with HGVs, thereby successfully hobbling the United
States' capability to intervene in a larger regional war. Consider a
Chinese attack on US bombers. China could assess that destroying the
deployed US nuclear bombers is an effective way to complicate or even
eliminate politically feasible response options for the United States.
It might rationalize that without proximate, proportional options that
would have a de-escalatory effect, the United States might simply decide
that the best option is to sue for peace. Or China could determine that
the United States would respond to a conventional attack against
vulnerable strategic targets with conventional weapons against Chinese
nonstrategic targets, and that the targets of those attacks are worth
sacrificing. It is still possible, however, that the US would respond to
a preemptive strategic attack---even if carried out by Chinese
conventional weapons ---with nuclear weapons. Across Republican and
Democratic administrations, the US has conspicuously and correctly
reserved that right so as not to communicate to adversaries that the
United States is more tolerant of conventional attacks even with
strategic consequences, which could inadvertently incentivize one.23
Still, [what matters is what the adversary believes the United States
would do, [setting up]{.mark} a potential **Chinese
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation** [that]{.mark} could [result in]{.mark} a
**disastrous [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But if the United States
has a credible ability to protect carriers and US deployed assets on US
territories and in Japan---for example, by intercepting increasingly
complex ballistic and cruise missiles and even highly capable HGVs---and
China believes this, that perception would powerfully contribute to
deterrence and defense if deterrence fails. It is one thing to be on the
receiving end of a US retaliatory strike after knocking out a crucial
target, but it would be another thing entirely to be on that receiving
end after having launched an unsuccessful attack against US strategic
interests and gaining little or nothing at all.

Likewise, even though a Chinese attack against targets on the US
homeland is far less likely than an attack against US forces and assets
in the regional context, the advancements of missile defense and modern
technology should be leveraged to close vulnerabilities.
[**[Building]{.mark} up** and configuring the **US homeland [missile
d]{.mark}efense** architecture such that **China** would not be sure it
could successfully land a **few ICBMs**]{.underline} on US soil [only
**[decreases]{.mark}** the **[likelihood]{.mark} that [China]{.mark}**
would **[attempt it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Modern missile defense must
seek to more thoroughly disabuse China of the notion that it could
easily accomplish a successful first strike. If deterrence fails,
missile defense will limit the damage of the attack and allow the United
States more options to respond with offensive weapons undamaged by the
attack and to carry out the military campaign successfully--- ending the
war on terms most favorable to the United States. A missile defense
strategy that rightfully integrates attack operations would then seek to
destroy an adversary's missiles or its ability to launch them. If done
successfully, this approach gives US defensive systems a greater
advantage as they have fewer missiles to track, discriminate, and
intercept.

### Minerals\-\--Impact\-\--Readiness

#### Only reducing [dependence]{.underline} can solve [military readiness]{.underline}.

**Hanson 21**, \[Evan Hanson, \"Winning Without War: Chinese Supremacy

Published June 29^th^, 2021, Accessed July 27^th^, 2025 // ajap\]

Since the end of World War II, [[technological superiority]{.mark} has
been the [**cornerstone** of American military
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past 80 years, the [U.S.
**restrained** the all-out world war conflict]{.underline} of the
twentieth century with sufficient numbers, highly capable weaponry, and
logistical agility to timely deliver force en masse. The [success of
this strategy]{.underline} has also [**shaped** how [China]{.mark} is
**[challenging]{.mark}** the existing [U.S.]{.mark}-led world
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}. Violent [[confrontation]{.mark} while the
U.S. maintains this technological advantage with a network of alliances
[would mean **ruin**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [China seeks to win
on a battlefield **more discrete** but **as consequential** to American
interests: **supply chains**]{.underline}.

Framing this [[global supply chain competition]{.underline}]{.mark} in
militaristic terms [is **important**]{.underline}, given the potential
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[U.S. **military readiness** and
**power projection**]{.mark} capabilities
**[globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While generations of U.S. scholars
and government officials previously held up China as a model for
countries seeking to integrate with the global economy through
cooperation and peace, it is becoming increasingly clear that [leaders
in the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty seek outcomes
that]{.underline} run [**[counter]{.mark}** to [American
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[1\] The systematic
[[suppression]{.mark} of dissent [in Hong Kong]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
consistent [threats from the P]{.underline}eople's
[L]{.underline}iberation [A]{.underline}rmy to [conquer
**[Taiwan]{.mark}**, and the [persecution of Uighur Muslims]{.mark}
are]{.underline} all [examples of how China will]{.underline} likely
[use its influence]{.underline}, particularly [as the country expands an
**already dominant role** in global supply chains]{.underline}.\[2\]

IN ADDITION TO SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION, CHINA HAS INVESTED
SUBSTANTIALLY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS TELECOMMUNICATIONS
INFRASTRUCTURE.

To what extent does China control supply chains and how will this impact
the U.S. military? [In microchips and semiconductors]{.underline}, which
are used in everything from iPhones to the newest F-35 fighter jets,
[China]{.underline} is [on]{.underline} [track to]{.underline} achieve
its goal to [fulfill 70% of domestic production requirements by 2025
and]{.underline} to [lead global production by 2030]{.underline}.\[3\]
While the U.S. and its allies account for more than 53 percent of these
technological building blocks and China lags at 6 percent, the [country
has earmarked **\$118 billion** to further develop its domestic
industry]{.underline}---a development which the Center for Strategic and
International Studies assesses will be used for "intelligence, military,
commercial, and political advantage."\[4\] The loss in global market
share would limit the pool of potential chip vendors that support the
production of American military equipment and weapon systems.

CHINESE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES WITH 5G WILL
EXACERBATE SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES, ENABLING GREATER TECHNOLOGY
THEFT AND EXPOSING DATA ON MATERIEL USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF U.S. AND
NATO WEAPONS SYSTEMS.

In addition to semiconductor production, China has invested
substantially in [[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline}
and its telecommunications infrastructure. This combination of data from
the country's global roll out of 5G and unprecedented processing
capability will provide the Chinese government with unrivaled power to
influence governments and control societies. \[5\] These
[capabilities]{.underline} also [make it **easier** for Chinese agents
to access **proprietary** and **confidential** information, [posing a
**threat** to supply chains]{.mark} as American businesses engage in
commerce globally]{.underline}. The current FBI Director, Christopher
Wray, has sounded the alarm on this issue, describing the scale of
Chinese intellectual property theft as "the largest transfers of wealth
in human history."\[6\] [Chinese development of artificial intelligence
capabilities with 5G will **exacerbate** supply chain vulnerabilities,
[enabling]{.mark} greater [technology]{.mark} **[theft]{.mark}** and
[exposing data on]{.mark} materiel used in the production of [U.S. and
NATO **weapons systems**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This [infiltration into supply chains that support military requirements
is **not theoretical**]{.underline}. In 2018, the
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
published a [report]{.underline} "Assessing and Strengthening the
Manufacturing and Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the
United States," which [found that the [majority of
**counterfeit**]{.mark} electronics [came from China and create
**vulnerabilities**]{.mark} in American defense
systems]{.underline}.\[7\] In 2019, the U.S. Justice Department
uncovered and prosecuted cases involving Chinese-made cameras and
surveillance equipment found on American military installations.\[8\]
The [presence of these electronics shows how **military** supply chains
may be **compromised**.]{.underline} Even with fifth generation
aircraft, autonomous naval vessels, or next generation squad weapons,
[Chinese [exploitation of supply chain
vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[**jeopardize** U.S. Military
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} by [diminishing]{.underline} the
[**readiness** and **potential production**]{.underline} of these
weapons systems.

Beyond domestic investment, China's reach extends through foreign direct
investment in the infrastructure of resource rich developing
countries---particularly in Africa. Capturing supply of these rare-earth
elements (REEs) that are critical to the production of technological
components, China is posturing to corner global markets, raising
concerns over the tremendous leverage it will have on the world economy
writ large.\[9\] Chinese companies now control or have influence over 59
percent of global lithium reserves, a mineral important for the
manufacture of batteries and other advanced electronics.\[10\] From the
development of rare-earth element mines to the Belt and Road Initiative
that aims to connect markets across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia,
China's control of supply chains and infrastructure is unmatched. \[11\]
Current estimates suggest that the Chinese government has given more
than \$1 trillion to foreign countries for this Belt and Road Initiative
investment.\[12\] China has not yet asked for payment on the debt it
holds over these countries---at least publicly---but the country's
dominant market positions and the substantial amount it is owed for
these infrastructure projects will provide economic, military, and
diplomatic leverage.\[13\]

BY EXPLOITING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN SUPPLY CHAINS TO DOMINATE MARKETS
CRITICAL TO NATIONAL SECURITY, ASSERT UNDEMOCRATIC VALUES, AND CONTROL
NATURAL RESOURCE RICH AREAS, CHINA SEEKS TO INCREASE ITS RELATIVE
POSITION GLOBALLY AND LIMIT HOW THE U.S. COULD RESPOND TO PROTECT ITS
INTERESTS.

"The ultimate achievement is to defeat the enemy without even coming to
battle" wrote Sun Tzu in the Art of War.\[14\] Some 1500 years later,
modern [China]{.underline} has embraced a derivative approach to do just
that. By [exploiting opportunities within **supply chains** to dominate
markets critical to **national security**, assert **undemocratic**
values, and control natural **resource** rich areas]{.underline}, China
seeks to increase its relative position globally and limit how the U.S.
could respond to protect its interests.

The extent of Chinese control vis-à-vis supply chains will ultimately
depend on how the Biden administration, Congress, military services, and
American businesses respond. To counter, the administration must renew
American commitment to international organizations by placing the wealth
and the credibility of the U.S. behind them. The International Monetary
Fund and World Bank are ideally positioned to offer financing options
for developing countries seeking modernization as an alternative to
China's ambiguous motivations and unsustainable lending through the Belt
and Road Initiative. By engaging the international community to ensure
borrowing countries can maintain their own sovereignty, the U.S. can
reduce dependencies on China in global supply chains. Secondly, [the
[U.S. government **must**]{.mark} partner with American businesses to
[develop **domestic**]{.mark} sources of [supply for
**r**]{.mark}are-**[e]{.mark}**arth **[e]{.mark}**lement**[s]{.mark}**
and invest in materials science initiatives to explore **alternatives**
and **mitigate dependencies**]{.underline}. In the past year, the U.S.
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense has
[invested \$13 billion]{.underline} in domestic mines, but [this is
**only a start**]{.underline}. \[15\] In 2018, the United States was
solely dependent upon imports for the seventeen elements classified as
rare-earth elements, with 80 percent sourced from China.\[16\] Every
percent of market share that can be shifted away from China will reduce
the country's leverage over the U.S. and its allies.

...THE ABILITY OF THE U.S. TO PRODUCE MORE WEAPONS TO MEET THE DEMAND OF
A WAR WITH CHINA WOULD BE LIMITED BECAUSE OF BOTTLENECKS IN MILITARY
SUPPLY CHAINS.

More than merely raw material access, the [American military services
must consider the supply chains of potential weapons systems throughout
the **acquisitions** process]{.underline}. Specifically, the services
must evaluate the critical supply chain dependencies of weapon systems
in addition to balancing cost, schedule, and technical performance.
\[17\] With respect to China as a rival, [it is]{.underline}
particularly [relevant that the U.S. military knows its **critical
dependencies** in weapon system production because of China's capacity
to **marshal** a leading industrial base for its]{.underline} own
[weapons manufacturing]{.underline}. As David Alman and Heather Venable
rightly point out, the [principle of mass in warfare still matters in
war]{.underline}, even while the U.S. maintains a technological edge
over potential adversaries.\[18\] However, the [[ability of the U.S. to
produce]{.mark} more [weapons to meet]{.mark} the [demand of a war with
China]{.mark}]{.underline} would be [[limited because of **bottlenecks**
in **military supply chains**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Scalability of
production, dependency of materials, and manufacturing facility
requirements for prospective weapon systems must be considered to ensure
government-owned and -operated facilities, such as the military's
arsenals, academic centers, and private businesses that make up the
American defense industrial base are ready to support potential
requirements of the U.S. military in conflict and maintain a
conventional military overmatch to deter China.\[19\]

[China's]{.underline} deliberate [approach to secure critical resources
abroad and leverage **vulnerabilities** in]{.underline} American [supply
chains]{.underline} simultaneously [strengthens their position and
limits]{.underline} the [potential of the U.S. technological
advantage]{.underline}. While [China]{.underline} may not overtly
confront the U.S. militarily, its [influence on the global economy
through supply chains is changing the]{.underline} equation of a formula
that has maintained a [**peace** between great powers]{.underline}. Even
if great power competition does not lead to war, China's crowning
achievement in applying Sun Tzu's maxim of victory without battle may be
the extent of its control on global supply chains.

#### Nuclear war.

**Means '21** \[Grady; 2020; Former Policy Assistant to Vice President
Nelson Rockefeller, Retired American Business Executive, MA in Economics
and Engineering from Stanford University; The Hill, "Biden Brings The
World Closer To Nuclear War,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/569732-biden-brings-the-world-closer-to-nuclear-war\]

Over the past six months, [the world has edged closer to **nuclear
war**]{.underline} than it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis. The
Doomsday Clock is ticking toward midnight. [The global power balance has
been dramatically reshuffled, and the potential for disastrous
miscalculation hasn\'t been so high in 80 years]{.underline}. The match
and fuse for this is instability --- **[a]{.underline}**n exaggerated
[sense of [U.S. **weakness**]{.mark} and lack of **capability** and
**resolve**]{.underline} --- that [[could lead to **huge**]{.mark}**,
aggressive military [miscalc]{.mark}ulations**]{.underline} and mistakes
by our enemies. The Biden administration has set the table for such a
catastrophe.

[The timing could not be more dangerous. **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}
has changed strategic direction and [[has been building its]{.mark}
**nuclear [stockpile]{.mark}**]{.underline} and delivery systems. China
also has continued to develop **[hypersonic weapons]{.underline}**,
including stand-off "carrier killers," space weapons and cyber
capabilities to blind opponents' strategic and conventional systems.
[**[Russia]{.mark}** has]{.underline} been [advertising]{.underline}
(mostly for domestic consumption, but nonetheless worrying) its
["unstoppable" delivery systems]{.underline}, and has a very capable
nuclear stockpile and military. [**[Iran]{.mark}** will continue to move
forward with building nuclear weapons. [**Pakistan** and
**India**]{.mark} both have significant nuclear capability]{.underline}
in an increasingly unstable part of the world. [Nuclear-armed **North
[Korea]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} again assuming a more [belligerent]{.mark}
posture. **Israel** has a full nuclear triad]{.underline} (land, air,
subs) [to respond to existential aggression. The **U.K.** and **France**
have significant nuclear deterrents. **[The world is a powder
keg]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In Hollywood terms, today's capacity for nuclear holocaust is thousands
of times greater than the era portrayed in the Armageddon films "On the
Beach," "Fail Safe," or "Dr. Strangelove." There would not be anything
left for "Mad Max." Climate disasters may be unfolding over the next
hundred years. Nuclear disaster is unfolding now. COVID-19 has killed
more Americans than the flu typically does. [**[Nuc]{.mark}**lear [war
could **kill us all**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our leaders must get their
priorities straight.

[The [danger lies in]{.mark} the]{.underline} growing global
[[perception of **weakness**]{.underline}]{.mark} and incompetence in
the Biden administration, combined with claims of the politicized
weakening of the FBI, CIA, State Department and Defense Department. This
has crystallized in Secretary of State Antony Blinken's unsure Anchorage
meeting with the Chinese, Biden's wooden Geneva summit with Russia's
Vladimir Putin, the colossal failure of the Afghan withdrawal, which may
devolve into a humiliating hostage crisis for America, and the budget-
and inflation-based defunding of Defense. In addition, the fully
politicized Intelligence and Armed Services committees on Capitol Hill
add to the danger. Our enemies may decide that now is the time to move.

It would be a huge miscalculation.

[Catastrophic mistakes at this scale often unfold when [**isolated
events light powder kegs**, which]{.mark} then **inexorably
[explode]{.mark}** [into **global conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[An incident in Sarajevo lit a **powder keg** of nationalistic, economic
and ambitious personality struggles in Europe to unleash World War
I]{.underline}. A century later, [possible "Sarajevos" are numerous:
China's]{.underline} overly aggressive and self-confident People's
Liberation Army pushing for the [use o]{.underline}f military [force
against Taiwan, calculating a **weak**]{.underline} and ineffective
[**U.S. response**, leading to]{.underline} the [sinking of a U.S.
carrier and a]{.underline} potential [march toward **nuclear
exchange**]{.underline}. Major [North Korean aggression against South
Korea]{.underline}, or an off-course North Korean missile hitting a
Japanese city. [A]{.underline} successful [Iranian (Hamas, Hezbollah)
terrorist attack against]{.underline} an **[Israel]{.underline}**i city.
[The seizure of]{.underline} one or more [Pakistani nuclear weapons
systems by a Taliban or]{.underline} another [terrorist-linked group.
Overt aggression or a "misunderstanding" between Pakistan and India. A
"Crimson Tide" communications error. Proof that a devastating bioterror
attack was intentional. The list of potential **doomsday scenarios** is
**endless**]{.underline}.

[The [one]{.mark} powerful [factor holding back]{.mark} such
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulations [has been]{.mark} **coherent [U.S.]{.mark}
foreign policy** and **[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}, combined with
pragmatists in Moscow and Beijing. But in the past six months, the
world's confidence in the U.S. leadership has begun to slip. An
agonizing hostage crisis would make it even more dangerous. Added to
that is the potential that [a]{.underline} stubborn and [wounded U.S.
**admin**]{.underline}istration [might **overreact** to try to show its
strength]{.underline}. The U.S. has devastating countermeasures for all
enemy strategies, and [an **enemy underestimating** that power, combined
with a White House trying to **prove itself**, could be
**disastrous**]{.underline}.

All three are part of a class of 17 elements known as

percent of its rare-earth metal consumption.

Now, the U.S. government is moving to change that equation. On Sept. 30,
President Donald J. Trump declared U.S. dependence on China for
rare-earth elements a national emergency, issuing an executive order
directing a multi-agency review and immediate action to provide loan
guarantees and grants to help stimulate domestic supply. U.S. mining
firms, and possibly some foreign-owned competitors, will be eligible for
those funds. In addition, Trump ordered environmental restrictions
relaxed to further encourage domestic mining.

"Our nation's undue reliance on critical minerals, in processed or
unprocessed form, from foreign adversaries constitutes an unusual and
extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside
the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy
of the United States," Trump wrote. "I hereby declare a national
emergency to deal with that threat."

[[Relying]{.mark} on foreign sources [for]{.mark} these [critical
materials]{.mark} poses a **[risk]{.mark}** to the **[DOD's

Department of Defense 2021 budget request

In addition to rare-earth metals, China also provides more than half of
U.S. annual consumption of 31 of 35 materials deemed critical to
national security. The administration said the [[U.S. has no]{.mark}
domestic [supply]{.mark}]{.underline} for 14 of those. U.S. dependence
on China for gallium, graphite, and barite, among other materials,
"constitutes [[an]{.underline}]{.mark} unusual and **[[extraordinary
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**," the order states, to national security
and critical U.S. industries.

Competition for access to the Arctic Ocean and the rich resources
beneath is one reason China is trying to normalize its presence there,
Air Force Secretary Barbara M. Barrett said in July. In rolling out the
service's first-ever Arctic strategy, China wants "access to regional
resources, which are said to include over 90 billion barrels of oil and
an estimated trillion dollars' worth of rare-earth metals."

Trump's September order followed five presidential determinations for
the rare-earth elements supply chain issued in July 2019, addressing:
Light Rare-Earth Separation and Processing; Heavy Ra­re-Earth Separation
and Processing; Production of Rare-Earth Metals and Alloys; Production
of Neodymium Iron Boron Rare-Earth Permanent Magnets; and, production of
Samarium Cobalt Rare-Earth Permanent Magnets.

These efforts "will establish a domestic industrial capability to
support key aspects of the rare-earth supply chain," according to the
Pentagon's 2021 budget submission. "[Relying on **[foreign
sources]{.mark}** for these **critical materials** poses a
**[risk]{.mark}** to the DOD's [**readiness** to **deter**]{.mark} and
defeat [adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline}."

### Minerals\-\--Impact\-\--Satellites

#### Price volatility [wrecks]{.underline} satellites.

**Parthermore '11** \[Christine; 2011; Fellow at the Center for a New
American Security, Director of the Natural Security Program, MA from
Georgetown's Security Studies Program; Center for a New American
Security, "Elements of Security: Mitigating the Risks of U.S. Dependence
on Critical Minerals," p. 10-13\]

For U.S. policymakers, the risks fall into two rough categories:
Disruptions, delivery lags and **[[price spikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [[affect military assets]{.mark} and place **unanticipated
strains** on defense procurement budgets]{.underline}; and lack of
affordable access to minerals and raw materials preventing important
national economic growth goals.

The defense industrial base in the modern era differs greatly from any
previous time. [Often, **[actual scarcity is not required]{.mark}** for
problems to arise, as **[concerns about future]{.mark}** scarcities
often [drive]{.mark} countries to behave as if [shortages]{.mark} are
occurring]{.underline}. The National Academies recently reported, "[The
risk of supply interruption]{.underline} arguably has increased or, at
the very least, [has become different]{.underline} from the more
traditional threats associated with the more familiar ideas of war and
conflict."14 During World War I and World War II, for example,
governments counted on domestic steel production -- and even civilian
willingness to contribute scrap materials for reuse and recycling -- for
tanks and other equipment. In contrast, [modern warfare relies on
globalized and privatized supply chains]{.underline} rather than a
primarily domestic (and often government-run) network. [Vulnerability to
mineral supply disruptions is]{.underline} likewise **[far
broader]{.underline}** and more complicated than it was in previous
eras.

Policymakers should also consider minerals that play uniquely important
roles in the American economy. Rare earths, for example, are important
in petroleum refining, which today enables the smooth functioning of the
economy. Looking to the longer term, much concern is turning toward
minerals that may see booming demand as the economy develops a greater
reliance on energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, such as
the lithium used in advanced batteries and hybrid and electric vehicles.
These minerals will directly affect U.S. economic competitiveness, and
plans for improving economic growth and job development.

This vulnerability is not a new concern. Since the early 1900s, U.S.
defense analysts and national policymakers have worried about U.S.
vulnerabilities to supply disruptions of the minerals critical to
manufacturing defense systems, from tanks and munitions to
communications equipment. These concerns were generally heightened in
wartime. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil
embargo and related oil crises of the 1970s further brought into
question the assumption that the United States could depend on imports,
as it became apparent that broader **[[global
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and political decisions by other
countries **[could [dramatically hinder]{.mark} the U.S. [ability
to]{.mark} openly [purchase]{.mark} sufficient commodities [at
affordable costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This conclusion was reinforced
when supply disruptions and threats of disruptions by apartheid-era
South Africa, the hostile Soviet Union and its satellites led to a wave
of congressional hearings, government reports and independent analysis
of the conditions contributing to U.S. vulnerability.15

Following these Cold War-era events, policymakers held hearings and
commissioned studies in order to understand which specific factors were
most important in signaling that U.S. economic and security interests
may be in jeopardy. American analysts generally agreed that the
following factors were the most important to track:

Level of substitutes and the uniqueness of specific minerals.

• Level of U.S. domestic supplies and dependence on foreign sources.

• Geographic concentration of supplies.

• Stability of producing countries and their region.

• Distances and routes of supply chains.

• Availability of technology to recover and process the minerals.

• Economic price of the resources themselves.

• Inability of foreign governments to coordinate minerals policies.

• Level of domestic demand in producing countries.

Some of these concerns remain today, but changes in technology,
economics and the international security environment will pose new
challenges as well. [[Analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[pinpoint
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark}'s rising resource demand [as the major
new cause for concern]{.underline}, yet limited transparency and the
changing nature of the defense industrial base and the broader economy
will also affect U.S. mineral supplies in the coming decades. Looking
forward, major concerns for the U.S. government will include: Lack of
sufficient information for policymakers; understanding the evolving
energy paradigm; increasing exploration of space and seabed territory;
and a changing defense industrial base.

Poor information is a major obstacle to addressing critical mineral
vulnerabilities, and it is creating conditions in which hype could drive
policy debates. For example, the media and others focused heavy
attention throughout 2009 and 2010 on Bolivia's potentially large
lithium supplies, often noting the populist, and at times erratic,
behavior of the Bolivian president as a reason for great concern over
future lithium availability. In reality, many independent experts agree
that reliable exporters such as Chile and Argentina will prove to be the
most important lithium suppliers for years, and supply gluts in the
lithium market will continue for the foreseeable future even in the face
of rising demand. Yet the popular media focus on lithium rarely, if
ever, includes this market information.16

Identifying when and how mineral supply disruptions (or threats of
disruptions) could affect U.S. defense industries or foreign relations
is further complicated by both often-long global supply chains and the
nature of transactions. In some cases, natural disasters or strikes halt
production at specific mines that produce large proportions of global
supplies. In murkier cases, [["disruptions" manifest as **long
contracting** or **legal delays**]{.mark} (often]{.underline}
intentional, [[for **pricing**]{.underline}]{.mark} or political
**[[reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}**) or long lags in delivery. [Whether
disruptions are abrupt and clear, or long and uncertain, delivery times
and prices of important energy technologies and military equipment can
**rise significantly**]{.underline}. Today's global supply chains are
incredibly efficient, as companies have worked to reduce the slack in
their transit routes and shipping plans. This efficiency can save energy
and money, but as infrastructure, routes and people are taken out of
service, it also reduces options when things go wrong.17

Four other trends are changing the ways in which minerals affect U.S.
security and foreign policy interests.

A New Energy Paradigm

Efforts to develop alternative energy sources will influence the global
demand for minerals. Governments around the world are promoting a more
sustainable, lower-carbon energy paradigm that includes increasing
adoption of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency technologies,
advanced batteries and other products. Just as rare earths and other
minerals are critical to petroleum production, developing and
manufacturing wind turbines, solar energy systems and efficient
batteries on a large scale will drive new mineral demands. In
particular, energy storage will be critical in the coming decades for
militaryspecific energy innovation, electric grid security, clean energy
development and much more. As a result, the Obama administration has
already identified energy storage as a key technology advanced energy
storage units in Afghanistan.

Such significant investments in research and development are likely to
produce new technologies that trigger major changes in global mineral
requirements over the decades ahead, making it crucial for the U.S.
government to monitor mineral supply chains.

A Ne w Space Race

Due to requirements for advanced technologies and components that can
withstand extreme conditions, the expansion of [countries' **space
capabilities**]{.underline} over the coming decades [will influence
demand for critical minerals]{.underline}. A range of nations -- from
India to Iran -- aim to bolster their reputations as space powers and
develop more advanced satellite systems and launch capabilities. The
U.S. government must therefore expect demand growth (and potentially
growth that is not linear or predictable) for minerals like rare earths
that are critical in space technologies. On the supply side, many
countries are considering the possibility of mining space objects, and
even the 2010 U.S. National Space Policy suggests that the United States
should "identify potentially resource-rich planetary objects."18

A Rev oluti on in Seabe d Explorati on

Seabed mineral exploration is high on the agenda for a range of
countries and companies and, if major new supplies are discovered, will
substantially change the global market for critical minerals. After
decades of major investments in seabed exploration by scientists,
petroleum producers and others, the world is experiencing great advances
in the technical and economic viability of undersea exploration and
exploitation. Countries seeking to mine these potentially important
seabed mineral reserves may engage in territorial disputes as a result,
even though doubt remains over whether, where and at what price seabed
mineral supplies may become economical to produce. For example,
territorial disputes over areas of the Arctic that are opening up to
exploration and in the South China Sea -- areas seen as having great
mineral supply potential -- are already concerning U.S. military
strategists and diplomats. The possibility of seabed mining is already
fueling a renewed debate about whether the United States should ratify
the U.N. Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS).

A Global De fense Industri al Base

Given the state of the modern defense industrial base, the National
Academies of Science determined in 2008, "The Department of Defense
appears not to fully understand its needs for specific materials or to
have adequate information on their supply."19 [In the information age,
the [U.S. military]{.mark} increasingly relies on dual-use equipment and
**[depends on globalized]{.mark} supply [chains]{.mark}**. Military
[equipment]{.mark} for the]{.underline} modern [battlefield
[includes]{.mark} communications technologies, robotics, computer
systems and **[space assets]{.mark}** that are used by DOD]{.underline},
civilian government agencies and private enterprises alike. Indeed, a
2008 Defense Science Board report noted, "[Military-relevant technology
will continue to change rapidly and will be **increasingly
global**.]{.underline}"20 [Defense supply chains are]{.underline},
therefore[, less distinct from those in the broader economy as they once
were, and the [dual-use nature]{.mark} of a broad range of assets also
[means]{.mark} that many supply [chains are]{.mark} more globalized than
ever. Moreover, "**[high]{.mark}er [risk]{.mark}** of and uncertainty
about **supply disruptions [owing to]{.mark}** the
**[fragmentation]{.mark}** of global supply chains"]{.underline}21
[[can]{.mark} further **[threaten]{.mark} assured [access]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} critical [minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Much of today's
defense equipment is purchased directly from civilian
vendors]{.underline} and designed to meet both civilian and military
needs. [[Consider]{.mark} modern warfare's **[dependence on]{.mark}
computer systems, [satellites]{.mark}**, radar and Global Positioning
System]{.underline}. The National Academies study notes, "The
globalization of materials production and supply has radically changed
the ability of the United States to produce and to procure materials
vital to defense needs," and that the [stockpiling]{.underline} system
[is inadequate given]{.underline} today's [global supply
systems]{.underline}.22

#### Extinction.

As world leaders meet in Copenhagen to consider drastic carbon emission

another environmental problem: **[Space junk]{.underline}**.\[1\]
[Unlike]{.underline} with [climate change, there's no difference of
scientific opinion about this problem---orbital debris counts increased
13% in 2009 alone]{.underline}, with the catalog of tracked objects

too small to see and all racing around the Earth at over 17,500 miles

### Minerals\-\--Impact\-\--Moon

#### Resource extraction from Greenland's key to [Moon basing]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

[[**Moon dust**: Greenland\'s recipe for **saving Planet
Earth**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Greenland, a mining company is betting rock similar to the one the
Apollo missions brought back from the moon can address some of Planet
Earth\'s climate change problems.

\"This [rock was created in the early days in the formation of our
planet]{.underline},\" says geologist Anders Norby-Lie, who began
exploring anorthosite at the remote mountain landscape in Greenland nine
years ago.

More recently, it has excited mining companies and investors hoping to
sell it as a relatively sustainable source of aluminium as well as an
ingredient to make fibreglass.

The government elected in April has placed it at the centre of its
efforts to promote Greenland as environmentally responsible and even the
U.S. space agency NASA has taken note.

Report ad

[The [mineral-rich island]{.mark} has become [a **hot
prospect**]{.mark}]{.underline} for miners seeking anything from copper
and titanium to platinum and rare earth minerals, which are needed for
electric vehicle motors.

That could appear an easy solution to Greenland\'s challenge of how to
grow its tiny economy so it can realise its long-term goal of
independence from Denmark, but the government campaigned on an
environmental platform and needs to honour that.

\"Not all money is worth earning,\" Greenland\'s mineral resources
minister Naaja Nathanielsen told Reuters in an interview in the capital
Nuuk. \"We have a greener profile, and we\'ve been willing to make some
decisions on it pretty quickly.\"

Already the government has banned future oil and gas exploration and
wants to reinstate a ban on uranium mining.

That would halt development of one of the world\'s biggest rare earth
deposits, named Kuannersuit in Greenlandic and Kvanefjeld in Danish
because the deposit also contains uranium.

Kuannersuit, whose operator was in the final stages of securing a permit
to mine, was a flashpoint issue in April\'s election because locals fear
the uranium it contains could harm the country\'s fragile environment.

\"As far as we are concerned, uranium is a political issue which is
being driven by exaggerated and misleading claims,\" licence holder
Greenland Minerals (GGG.AX) CEO John Mair told Reuters.

The mine could bring in royalties of around 1.5 billion Danish crowns
(\$233 million) each year, the government has said.

By contrast, revenue from two small mines operating in the country is
negligible, and Nathanielsen says the government\'s budget plans do not
assume any mining revenue.

THE DANISH MONEY TRAP

Some see little point in mineral exploitation until Greenland has
achieved independence.

A Danish colony until 1953, the semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom
of Denmark has the right to declare independence through a simple vote,
but that is likely to be a distant prospect.

Greenland has commissioned work to draft a constitution for a future
independent Greenland.

Meanwhile, Greenland\'s 57,000 people rely on fishing and grants from
Denmark.

The grants would be reduced in proportion to future earnings from
mining, prompting some to say the minerals should be left in the ground
for now.

\"Under the current agreement, large-scale mineral extraction makes no
sense,\" Pele Broberg, minister for business and trade, told Reuters.
\"Why should we do that while we\'re subject to another country?\"

Others are concerned the government is deterring investment in
large-scale mining of more conventional minerals, which they say is the
way to diversify the economy and make it capable of standing alone.

Jess Berthelsen, head of Greenland\'s labour union SIK, had hoped the
planned mine at Kuannersuit and other large-scale projects would create
jobs and said the Danish grants held Greenland back.

\"Sometimes I wish Denmark would stop sending money, because then people
in this country would start waking up. It\'s lulling us to sleep,\" he
said.

Business lobbyists meanwhile worry about government\'s plan to reinstate
a uranium ban - only eight years after it was lifted.

\"The companies are used to being under pressure from authorities, but
they are not used to this kind of instability,\" Christian Keldsen, head
of Greenland Business Association, said.

LOCAL SUPPORT

Those living nearest to the standout mineral in the government plans for
sustainable mining tend to support the pursuit of new income.

\"We have to find other ways to make money. We can\'t just live off
fishing,\" said Johannes Hansen, a local fireman and carpenter living in
Qeqertarsuatsiaat. The town of around 160 people is about 50 minutes by
boat from the planned anorthosite mine.

Greenland Anorthosite Mining, which is developing the mine, has a plan
to ship 120 tonnes of crushed anorthosite to potential customers in the
fibreglass industry where it says it has value as a more environmental
alternative to kaolin.

The company, which hopes to have an exploration permit by the end of
2022, says anorthosite melts at a lower temperature than kaolin, has a
lower heavy metal content and produces less waste and greenhouse gas
emissions.

The bigger aim is for anorthosite to be used as an alternative to
bauxite to produce aluminium, one of the minerals seen as central to
reducing emissions because it can be used to make vehicles lighter and
is fully recyclable.

Greenland Anorthosite Mining says aluminium can be produced more easily
than when bauxite ore, the primary source of aluminium, is used, and
again produces less waste compared with existing processes.

Anorthosite also fits in with European Union ambitions to diversify
mineral sources. It is found in Canada and Norway, as well as Greenland,
while bauxite is concentrated in a belt around the Equator.

Asuncion Aranda, who is heading an EU-funded research project into
anorthosite, said the technology had been seen to work although research
is needed to cut costs and minimise the environmental impact.

\"We don\'t know yet if our process will be competitive from the start
compared with the established production method,\" she said.

\"If all goes well and the aluminium industry is in, then we could see
the first commercial production in eight to ten years.\"

UNEARTHLY AMBITIONS

While the EU is focused on earthly uses and curbing emissions, [[NASA
has **ambitions** to find **new environments**]{.mark} for human
activity]{.underline}.

[It has been [using]{.mark} crushed **[anorthosite]{.mark}** powder
[from]{.mark} a **smaller** **[Greenland]{.mark}** mine already in
production]{.underline}, operated by Canadian-based Hudson Resources
(HUD.V), [[to **test equipment**]{.mark} as [part of a **space race**
that]{.mark} would [involve **mining**]{.mark} **on [the moon]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} even **[establishing communities
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"[The [deposits in Greenland]{.mark} and elsewhere [are not exactly
like the moon, but]{.mark} they\'re **pretty [darn
close]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" said John Gruener, a space scientist at
NASA\'s Johnson Space Centre.

\"[If we\'re really going [to **live off the land** at]{.mark} the south
pole of [the moon]{.mark}, which everybody is interested in now,
[we]{.mark} will **[have to learn how to deal with
anorthosite]{.mark}**, the **[dominant rock]{.mark}** that\'s
there]{.underline},\" he said. \"[Having another [supply]{.mark} of
anorthosite [from Greenland is **great**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

**Shapiro '9** \[Dr. Robert; 2009; Professor Emeritus and Senior
Research Scientist in the Chemistry Department of New York University;
Space Policy, "A New Rationale for Returning to the Moon? Protecting
Civilization with a Sanctuary," p. 1\]

1\. Introduction: two worthy causes

The Alliance to Rescue Civilization [(ARC)]{.underline} group [advocates
the establishment of a]{.underline} permanent staffed [base on the
Moon]{.underline} for the purpose of preserving the scientific and
cultural documents and objects that support our civilization \[1\]. We
believe that a unique opportunity has arisen to link two worthy causes
that have emerged in the recent past; each of which might flounder if
allowed to proceed separately.

1)  [The past decades have seen an explosion in the production of
    scientific [data]{.mark} and cultural material. By force of
    necessity they are being stored in digital form]{.underline}. Older
    materials are also being converted to digital form, allowing much of
    humanity access to a treasure of science and art that can readily be
    explored and utilized. [However, this new [storage]{.mark} medium
    [is]{.mark} **more [fragile]{.mark}** than paper, both because of
    its **inherent nature** and of its greater **vulnerability to local
    disasters and global catastrophes**. [If]{.mark} our cultural
    heritage were substantially damaged or [lost]{.mark}, our
    **[civilization could not function]{.mark}**, and [humanity
    would]{.mark} be **[reduce]{.mark}d [to a barbaric state]{.mark}**.
    A measure of protection could be gained by the construction of
    facilities which would **preserve our heritage**, and **assist in
    the reconstruction** of society after a catastrophe]{.underline}.

2)  A generation ago human beings walked on the Moon. The Apollo program
    may have resulted as a by-product of competition between nations in
    the Cold War, but it produced media coverage and images that were
    inspirational. However, no further purpose emerged from that
    presence to stimulate the imagination of the public, and no further
    human expeditions beyond Earth orbit have been launched since that
    time. Several years ago President George Bush announced the Vision
    for Space Exploration \[2\], which involved a return of humans to
    the Moon. Economically emerging nations have also indicated an
    interest in lunar exploration. But the reasons provided have not
    really justified the expenses involved. In the absence of a
    transcendent purpose, the prospects for human expansion into space
    remain uncertain. We believe however that the construction of
    [[a]{.mark} substantial [lunar base]{.mark}]{.underline} as part of
    a program [to [ensure]{.mark} the **[survival of]{.mark} human
    [civilization]{.mark}** on Earth is a goal]{.underline} that would
    link and justify purposes (1) and (2). This would literally be a
    marriage made in heaven.

The following sections briefly describe the emerging data crisis and
explain the nature of the proposed remedy.

2\. The digital age of information storage

[Digital storage is **common**]{.underline} in certain areas of science
where enormous quantities of data are being generated, [for example
by]{.underline} the various [**[genome]{.mark} sequencing
[projects]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} by the **L**]{.underline}arge
**[H]{.underline}**adron **[C]{.underline}**ollider [at
[CERN]{.mark}]{.underline}, in Switzerland \[3\]. These
[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may consist of many terabytes (1012
bytes), [[are]{.mark} generated and stored in [digital]{.mark} form,
[with **no existence** on **paper**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other huge
[compendia of knowledge]{.underline} have accumulated more gradually.
Until recently they were housed as multiple volume sets that [challenged
the storage space of university libraries]{.underline}.

For example, Chemical Abstracts Service has provided a short account of
papers published in the significant journals of chemistry, and kept [a
record of chemical substances]{.underline}. By 2007 it had [listed 27
million journal articles and patent record summaries and over 31 million
chemicals]{.underline} \[4\]. In its first year of publication, 1907,
the Abstracts required three volumes of ordinary size. I examined one in
the New York University library several years ago and found that its
yellowed and brittle pages could still be used. The library\'s shelf
collection extended through 2000, a year in which Chemical Abstracts
consisted of 95 much larger volumes. For the years 2001 and on, online
coverage was offered. A similar story applies to many original journals
from which the Abstracts were compiled. Electronic subscriptions are
replacing paper ones, and even the older volumes are being scanned and
converted to electronic form. Some [new journals are appearing only in
electronic form]{.underline}.

A [similar]{.underline} story could be told [for other areas of
science]{.underline} and most other academic disciplines as well. In
2004, for example, Google announced an agreement with a number of
outstanding research libraries to convert their holdings into digital
files that could be searched over the web. This was called "[a step on
a]{.underline} long [road toward the]{.underline} long-predicted
**[global virtual library]{.underline}**" \[5\].

The same fate may be in store for cultural materials that are objects,
rather than printed text. Images of the object may serve to preserve
some of its value, should the original be destroyed. One ongoing project
is taking place in St. Gallen, Switzerland. The collection of rare early
medieval manuscripts in the Stiftsbibliothek is being digitized,
page-by-page, by a team of scanning experts which seeks to insure that
the original objects are not damaged \[6\]. A quick visit to the
library\'s website produced a reasonable reproduction of an obviously
tattered but legible page. Natural history museums contain vast
collections of unique specimens and fossils, images of which are in some
cases being prepared for storage in digital form \[7\]. Some efforts are
also underway to prepare state-of-the-art digital representations of
paintings from major museums \[8\].

The various attempts to preserve our cultural heritage are uncoordinated
and, in many cases, unfulfilled. For example, the effort to digitize the
Harvard College Observatory\'s unique and extensive collection of
astronomical photographic plates had run out of funds by mid-2007 \[9\].
There does appear to be some gradual movement toward cohesion, but for
the most part on a discipline-by-discipline basis. As a civilization we
seem much more concerned with generating data than preserving it. This
is unfortunate, because our developing forms of storage and backup are
extremely insecure.

3\. The need for systematic backup

While some ancient and medieval texts have survived to this day,
[requiring only secure storage, computer-stored knowledge appears quite
**[perishable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the absence of the test of
reality, various estimates have been made of the [typical [lifetime
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the various discs, tapes and [[drives]{.mark}
used to store]{.underline} our [data. It varies from [less than a
**decade**]{.mark} to perhaps a **century**. Simple **[failures in
maintenance]{.mark}** pose **a**]{.underline}nother
[problem]{.underline}. A survey found that [12% of]{.underline} the
[internet addresses cited]{.underline} in three prestigious medical and
scientific journals [were extinct two years after
publication]{.underline} \[10\]. [Even if]{.underline} suitable
long-lived materials were created and websites were [maintained,
continual **[obsolescence]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the software [would
[pose a problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. We face this on a personal level,
where the VHS format for films has given way to DVD, with further
improvements yet to come. I still maintain my collection of vinyl
phonograph records because I have preserved an obsolete machine to play
them.

On a much larger scale, the Sanger Institute sequencing center, near
Cambridge, UK has left a quarter of its space vacant, in anticipation of
the next generation of data storage machines. The data in the obsolete
older machines will be migrated to the new machines in a piecemeal
fashion, with additional space created by the removal of the sections
that have given up their function \[3\]. The timely installation of new
software also appears essential. As noted by professor Clifford Lynch of
the University of California School of Information: "machines will often
be compromised if updates aren\'t applied; this can mean data
destruction or corruption" \[11\]. Unlike ancient manuscripts which have
survived for centuries in unattended storage, the data collections of
the future will require continual attention from trained staffs. Skilled
individuals will be required not only to update the software and
hardware, but to control the environment.

For example, [massive banks of supercomputers generate considerable
heat]{.underline}: "Two floors of the Sanger data center are devoted to
cooling. The top one houses the current cooling system. The one below
sits waiting for the day that the center needs to double its cooling
capacity" \[3\]. Heat represents the worst fear of computer systems
administrators. [If power was shut off]{.underline}, and emergency
backup power failed, [immediate shutdown would be needed to prevent data
loss]{.underline} and damage to components \[3\].

Such circumstances essentially compel data centers to keep copies of
their holdings. "Disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed
labs and computing facilities, are important reminders that data need to
be backed up frequently and comprehensively in diverse and distant
locations." \[11\]. An example is furnished by an internet data archive
which stores copies of public pages posted on the world wide web since
1996. The three-archive "mirrors" are housed just south of the Golden
Gate in San Francisco, at the XS4ALL data center near Amsterdam and
under the New Library of Alexandria in Egypt. \[3\] We might note that
these sites are located in an earthquake-prone zone, a flood plain and a
region of political instability.

We inhabit a world where [hurricanes, [earthquakes]{.mark}, floods,
[epidemics]{.mark}, famines, local power failures, civil disturbances
and riots, limited [wars]{.mark} and terrorist attacks [are]{.mark}
increasingly [common]{.mark}]{.underline}. The production of backup
copies of data in duplicated facilities protects the data from
destruction by such local disasters and from equipment failures. On our
current trajectory, it seems likely that much of our [data will be
backed up, but in a **haphazard** fashion, **discipline-by-discipline**,
with some collections **falling between the cracks** and left
**unprotected**]{.underline}. Some unfortunate losses may take place,
but civilization will not fall because of them.

4\. The challenge of larger catastrophes

[A number of possible events [could cause **widespread loss**]{.mark}
**of life** and property damage]{.underline}. They include dedicated
cyberterrorism, nuclear wars, asteroid and comet impacts, plagues,
supervolcanic eruptions, climate change leading to widespread famine,
and civil disturbances arising from economic collapse. A detailed
description of such catastrophes lies beyond the scope of this article
but may be found in recent books \[12\], \[13\] and on the website of
the Lifeboat Foundation \[14\]. As a result of such catastrophes power
grids and the computer-based systems that rely on them would be
destroyed. We would lose the heritage that our civilization has acquired
through enormous effort over past centuries. [Humanity would be reduced
to a **medieval condition**, or worse. [To insure us]{.mark} against
this event [we need to place]{.mark} a copy of our [vital
materials]{.mark} **well [out of harm\'s way]{.mark}** [in a]{.mark}
suitable [sanctuary]{.mark}]{.underline}. I believe the Moon could
provide such a sanctuary and in Section 6 I shall show why a lunar
location may be ideal for this purpose.

Two [[geopolitical dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} properly
[[contextualize]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[risks]{.mark}** associated
[with China's **REE dominance**]{.mark}]{.underline}: 1) [Chinese
[**tensions** with the U.S. and its allies over
**trade**]{.mark}]{.underline} and 2) [Chinese [positioning on
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[81\] Given China's REE dominance as a
stable global supplier, would Chinese officials self-sabotage during
periods of relative peace, pushing Western countries to develop
alternatives proactively? Indeed, despite aggressive posturing and
threats from Chinese officials and tabloids, China has yet to restrict
REE exports as leverage in its trade war with the United States.
[Aggression toward Taiwan would]{.underline} likely [be a **completely
different** story, especially if the U.S. provides **military
equipment** or **combat support** to Taiwan]{.underline}. With more
centralized state oversight and a leadership structure more amenable to
central coordination, the [[China]{.mark} Rare Earth Group increases the
state's ability to [**influence** and]{.mark} possibly even
[**restrict** rare earth exports]{.mark} [for **political
reasons**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Whether [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[weaponize]{.mark} their
[leverage over]{.mark} rare earth [supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline} in
direct conflicts with the U.S. and/or its allies is a matter of
speculation and debate. However, [one thing is **for
sure**]{.underline}: In such an event, the [[U.S. must
**minimize**]{.mark} [China's **ability**]{.mark} to limit sanctions
[and]{.mark} other]{.underline} collective global responses against
potential [[coercive action]{.underline}]{.mark}. Taking the invasion of
Ukraine as an example, [Russia's]{.underline} VSMPO-Avisma's strong
[positioning as the leading global aerospace-grade titanium supplier
caused]{.underline} several [EU member states to oppose sanctions on the
company, despite its role in maintaining Moscow's force
posture]{.underline}.\[82\] In order to respond adequately to Chinese
military belligerence, [the U.S. must ensure that China's consolidated
rare earth industry does not grant Beijing **undue
influence**]{.underline} over an international response. The
[U.S.]{.underline} and its allies [[must act **accordingly** to
**divorce**]{.mark} their [strategic industries from]{.mark} [Chinese
rare earths]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a result of these dynamics, U.S. government officials are under
pressure to take significant steps. They [m[ust **mitigate** short- and
medium-term supply risks from **potential disruptions**]{.mark} in
Chinese supply]{.underline} and simultaneously [[take a **long-term
approach** to]{.mark} developing [a domestic rare earths
ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline}. The former relies more on filling
strategic stockpiles, securing alternative supplies from allied
countries like Australia and decreasing product reliance on rare earths
from an engineering standpoint where possible. The latter [involves a
more **holistic approach**]{.underline} of [bolstering several nodes
along rare earths value chains simultaneously]{.underline} (so they can
be connected once fully operational) and involving foreign capital in
these efforts when the opportunities present. [[Private-sector and
government **funding**]{.underline}]{.mark} from allies like Australia,
Japan and South Korea [[can be used to develop]{.underline}]{.mark}
"friendly" [rare earth [supply chains with]{.mark} more [**secure**
supply]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the United States' sole reliance
on allies to correct domestic industrial deficiencies in rare earths
would not provide the more robust REE supply chains that are envisioned.

On a global scale, [[China]{.mark} is the [**largest supplier** of

[specializations. Even if REE production is diversified outside

The funny thing about [[rare earth elements]{.underline}]{.mark} is that
they're **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** particularly
**[[rare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Planet [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[**loaded** with them]{.underline}]{.mark} --- only in an annoyingly

The [question is whether mining companies can overcome]{.underline} the
[**[headaches]{.mark}** inherent [in extracting rare]{.mark} [earths
from Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline}'s ice-free yet still frigid edges.
An [[outfit would have to ship in]{.underline}]{.mark} all their

cost]{.mark}]{.underline}. On top of that, [it would be
[difficult]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[hire]{.mark}
enough workers [from the island's population]{.mark}]{.underline} of
laborers, [so a [mining company]{.mark} may [need]{.mark} [to **hire
internationally**]{.mark} and bring them in. Greenland]{.underline} has
a [population of 57,000]{.underline}, just [65]{.underline} of whom
[were involved in mining]{.underline} as of 2020, so the **[[requisite

Q6: Are there any international partners from which the United States
could alternatively source heavy rare earths and fill the supply gap?

A6: While [**[several countries]{.mark}** are working to
[develop]{.mark} their [**light and heavy** rare earth]{.mark}s
[deposits]{.mark}]{.underline}, China maintains a monopoly on refined
heavy rare earths for the time being. [Australia, Brazil, South Africa,
Saudi Arabia, Japan, and Vietnam]{.underline} all have initiatives and
[investments underway to **[bolster]{.mark}**]{.underline} key [[REE
mining, processing, and]{.underline}]{.mark} research and development
([[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}) as well as magnet manufacturing.
[[For]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates to build alternative sourcing partners for
long-term supply chain security, it is [important to continue to provide
financial and [diplomatic]{.mark} support to
[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[success]{.mark}** of these
initiatives]{.underline}.

[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark} is [working to develop]{.underline} its
[[Browns Range]{.underline}]{.mark} to become the [first
**[significant]{.mark}** dysprosium [producer]{.mark} outside of
China]{.underline}. The deposit has estimated dysprosium reserves of
2,294 tons, to be unlocked in a multistage process resulting in 279,000
kg of dysprosium per year. However, much work remains to be done to
build processing and refining capacity outside of China. Australia's
Lynas Rare Earths is the largest producer of separated rare earths
outside of China, but still sends oxides to China for refining.
[Australia]{.underline} is expected to be [reliant on China]{.underline}
for REE refining [until **at least 2026**]{.underline}.

[Working with [international partners]{.mark}]{.underline} can also help
to [[overcome gaps in]{.underline}]{.mark} technological know-how when
it comes to [[REE]{.mark} [**separation** and
**processing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A few countries lead the way in
developing critical minerals and REE-specific R&D initiatives to support
the development of the strategic sector. The [Australian Critical
Minerals Research and Development Hub]{.underline} is working to boost
international R&D cooperation on critical minerals. The hub includes
rare earth and downstream processing initiatives lead by government
agencies working in partnership with industry and universities to boost
technical capacity. [Japan]{.underline} has the [Center for Rare Earths
Research]{.underline} within its Muroran Institute of Technology as well
as a joint initiative with Vietnam to improve REE extraction and
processing at the Rare Earth Research and Technology Transfer Centre in
Hanoi. The initiative was launched in 2012 as Japan looked to strengthen
and diversify its REE supply chains in response to China's REE export
ban in 2010.

Q4: Is the U.S. rare earths industry ready to fill the gap in the event
of a shortfall?

A4: No. There is [no heavy [rare earths separation]{.mark} happening in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates at present. The
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark} of these capabilities is
**[[currently underway]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In its 2024 National
Defense Industrial Strategy, the Department of Defense
([[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[set a goal]{.mark} [to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} a complete [[mine-to-magnet]{.mark} REE
[supply chain]{.mark} that can meet all U.S. defense needs **[by
2027]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2020, the [DOD]{.underline} has
[[committed over \$439 million]{.mark} toward building domestic supply
chains]{.underline}. In 2020, the Pentagon awarded MP Materials \$9.6
million through the DPA Title III program for a light rare earths
separation facility at Mountain Pass, California. In 2022, the Pentagon
awarded an additional \$35 million for a heavy rare earths processing
facility. These facilities would be the first of their kind in the
United States, fully integrating the rare earths supply chain from
mining, separating, and leaching in Mountain Pass to refining and magnet
production in Fort Worth, Texas. But even when these facilities are
fully operational, MP Materials will only be producing 1,000 tons of
neodymium-boron-iron (NdFeB) magnets by the end of 2025---less than 1
percent of the 138,000 tons of NdFeB magnets China produced in 2018. In
2024, MP Materials announced record production of 1,300 tons of
neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. In the same year, China produced an
estimated 300,000 tons of NdFeB magnets.

The DOD has thrown its support behind Lynas Rare Earth's U.S.
subsidiary, Lynas USA, as well. The company was awarded a \$30.4 million
DPA Title III grant in 2021 for a U.S. separation facility for light
REEs and another \$120 million in 2022 for a heavy REE processing
facility. These DPA investments are an important step in building
completely independent supply chains for REE magnets.

[[Mining pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [is a **[major
concern]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The [accessible land along the island's
ice-free edges is]{.underline} also [where **humans** live. As [mining
equipment and ships burn fossil fuels]{.mark}, they produce **[black
carbon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When this [settles on ice]{.underline},
it [[darkens]{.mark} the [surface, which]{.mark} then [absorbs **more
sunlight**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- think of how much hotter you get
wearing a black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day. This could
[[further **accelerate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**melting** of
Greenland's]{.mark} precarious **[ice sheet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
[2022]{.underline} study also found that three [[legacy mines]{.mark} in
Greenland **[heavily polluted]{.mark}** the [local]{.mark} [environment
with metals]{.mark}]{.underline}, like lead and zinc, [due
to]{.underline} the [[lack of environmental **studies** and

found no significant pollution at mines established in the last 20

A more [immediate problem with mining is]{.underline} the potentially
[[**toxic dust** generated by]{.underline}]{.mark} so much
[[machinery]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner

are [located]{.mark} in areas [where people

What challenges lie ahead for Arctic mining?

There is a stereotypical perception of the Arctic as a vacant expanse of
ice and sea -- a polar tundra that is more like Antarctica. While the
perception is untrue, extreme temperatures, remote locations and short
days have meant working in the region is not without its challenges.

In 2019, Guggenheim Partners, an investment firm that helped develop the
Arctic Investment Protocol alongside the World Economic Forum, projected
that to establish the infrastructure needed for a connected Arctic,
\$1trn would be needed over the next 15 years.

If done correctly, a fully-fledged mining industry could bring
significant benefits to local Arctic economies and communities as well
as the global stage, but there is the caveat that it will require a lot
of work.

"Building a better Arctic -- and a better world -- requires long-term
capital that carefully weighs environmental and societal impact to
support sustainable growth," the report stated. "It demands an entirely
new framework for investment on a truly massive scale."

Significant investment is also needed to attract (and keep) a workforce.
In the Nordic regions particularly, salaries, taxes and royalties are
typically higher, and must remain so if workers are expected to work
long hours at isolated, cold mine sites.

"Private funding alone won't be enough," says Frederiksen. "LKAB is a
good example because they have attracted investment from the government
and the EU, but as this is state-owned it brings up the question of
whether it is only state-owned companies' \[projects\] that will be
developed?"

Environmental concerns

Mine development also needs to be done sustainably and with awareness of
the Arctic's unique landscapes. Environmental groups have already voiced
concerns over the impact the industry could have on a landscape already
susceptible to climate change.

While these concerns are primarily focused on deep-sea mining in the
region -- where plans to issue seabed mining exploration permits has
been paused due to environmental concerns -- they also extend to onshore
projects.

Stringent regulatory frameworks in the Nordic Arctic are expected to
help facilitate sustainable development to a degree. However, they have
proven a hindrance in the past, with large amounts of red tape often
slowing down progress, or halting it altogether.

Norway has not had a new mine in 30 years, while in 2021, Greenland's
Government banned new oil and gas licences as well as prohibited uranium
mining due to environmental concerns.

Push-back has also centred around another issue, that of ensuring local
communities receive adequate communication about the potential impacts
of mining operations.

China's Exports to the U.S.

On Feb. 1, 2025, President Trump announced a 10% tariff on Chinese goods
imported into the United States, which went into effect on Feb. 4, as
part of a broader tariff package.

In response, China announced retaliatory measures including tariffs on
select U.S. goods, export controls on critical minerals, a WTO lawsuit
against the U.S., and an investigation into Google.

Some Chinese industries will be more affected than others. This graphic
visualizes China's total exports to the U.S., the share of China's
exports that go to the U.S., and China's total exports excluding the
U.S. in billions of USD.

How Dependent is China on U.S. Trade?

Below, we show the value of China's exports (U.S. and non-U.S.) and the
share that the U.S. makes up of China's exports.

\<\<\<FIGURE 2 OMITTED\>\>\>

For decades, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has remained
[China's **dominant** export destination, importing more Chinese goods
than **any other country** in the world]{.underline}

In 2023, China's global exports reached \$3.4 trillion, with the United
States receiving \$502 billion---or 14.8%---of that total. This share
significantly exceeded that of the second-largest recipient, Hong Kong,
which accounted for 8.2% of China's exports

[[Consumer electronics represents China's **highest** U.S. **export
dependency** at **22%**]{.underline}]{.mark} of its exports. Among all
sectors, it also shows the smallest gap between U.S. and non-U.S.
exports, with non-U.S. exports (\$339 billion) only 3.5 times larger
than U.S. exports (\$96 billion).

Despite trade tensions, China maintains substantial export relationships
with the U.S. across traditional manufacturing sectors, with **[[home
appliances]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([[19%]{.underline}]{.mark}),
**[[textiles]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([[17%]{.underline}]{.mark}), [and
[optical/**medical**]{.mark} **[instruments]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[17%]{.underline}]{.mark}) [showing [**notable** U.S. market
share]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In December 2024, China's total exports to the U.S. reached \$48.83
billion, up from \$47.31 billion in November 2024, likely driven by
businesses rushing to ship goods before the anticipated tariffs increase
costs.

Looking ahead, as Donald Trump enters office in January 2025, there
could be an even stronger effort to reduce dependency on China for REEs.
During his first term, [Trump]{.underline} imposed tariffs on Chinese
goods and signed an executive order to [boost [domestic REE
production]{.mark}]{.underline}. A second term would likely intensify
these efforts, with [subsidies for U.S. mining and streamlined
regulations]{.underline}.

However, such measures [[face]{.mark} significant environmental and
community **[resistance]{.mark}**, complicating]{.underline} their
[implementation]{.underline}. Even if successful, [[domestic production
**alone** cannot meet]{.mark} the [**soaring** demand for
REEs]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly [[in]{.mark} high-tech and
[defense industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [[Trump's]{.mark}
reliance on [tariffs]{.mark} as a weapon could [trigger]{.mark}
**[Chinese retaliation]{.mark}**, escalating **[trade wars]{.mark}**
that [destabilize]{.mark} the **[global economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Strengthening alliances with REE-rich nations might further strain
relations with Beijing, risking broader geopolitical fallout. Meanwhile,
[an exclusive focus on [domestic mining]{.mark} risks
**[overlook]{.mark}ing** the [potential of alternative technologies
and]{.mark} [recycling]{.mark} innovations [that]{.mark}]{.underline}
could [[**reduce reliance** on REEs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Undoubtedly,
the global tug-of-war over rare earth elements underscores a bitter
truth: [whoever controls the **supply chains**, controls the
**future**.]{.underline}

While Western nations scramble to catch up, [[China's grip on]{.mark}
the [REE]{.mark} market remains a game-changing card, [reshaping]{.mark}
[geopolitics]{.mark} and technology]{.underline} alike. [Diversifying
sources and investing in alternative technologies are
**essential**]{.underline}, but [without bold, coordinated
action]{.underline}, these [strategies]{.underline} may [prove **too
little, too late**]{.underline}. Now more than ever, [it is time for
global cooperation to level the playing field and ensure that core
resources flow through **many hands** and not just one.]{.underline}

China: tightening the reins

The media often characterize the PRC's rare earths dominance as the
"trump card" of wolf warrior diplomacy, but [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}
Jinping likely [[understands]{.mark} that the]{.underline} implicit
[[threat of applying]{.mark} this [leverage
**outweighs**]{.mark}]{.underline} the cost-benefit of [its]{.underline}
actual [[use]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The international environment of today is far less forgiving than that
of 2010, and a rare earths embargo applied tomorrow on a nation like
Japan or the United States would easily spark a bellicose trade dispute
and push a tsunami of funding toward emerging competitors.

However, there exists a [dangerous window during the next several
years]{.underline}, when [the [PRC's influence]{.mark} over the global
industry is **diminishing** but still [**overwhelming** enough to put
importing nations in a **bind**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this sense,
[[Beijing]{.mark} could still use its "[trump card]{.mark}" over a
**critical political moment**]{.underline} -- something [that would
[become]{.mark} even [**more tempting** once its monopoly's

The second is the threat of substitutes. Necessity is the mother of
invention---and [[if substitutes can replace rare
earths]{.underline}]{.mark} in end-use products, then [[supply
fears]{.mark} may be **[sidestepped]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The embedded
risks of the elements have already been driving
[[manufacturers]{.underline}]{.mark} like Toyota and Volkswagen to
[[redesign]{.underline}]{.mark} their electric motors' [[magnets to use
**less rare earths**]{.underline}]{.mark} material -- or use alternative
(and less efficient) magnet metals.

The [[US]{.mark} Energy, Defense and Commerce departments]{.underline}
have been [[pursuing **alternatives**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
governments should also consider rewarding companies that find
innovative ways of designing their products without rare earth elements
in the style of bug bounties. Even [without implementing substitutes,
establishing [**backup** options build]{.mark}s supply chain
[**resilience** and]{.mark} [sap]{.mark}s the [power of]{.mark} a
[monopoly]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Tetrataenite]{.underline}]{.mark} is one promising breakthrough in
magnetic alternatives. Until recently, this nickel-iron alloy was only
observed in meteorite samples, but last year it was successfully
replicated in a University of Cambridge laboratory. Experts say it has
an outside chance at [[**upending** the entire rare earths
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} in the years to come.

Substituting materials

One [strategy to **reduce** the **demand** for **r**]{.underline}are
**[e]{.underline}**arth **[e]{.underline}**lement**[s]{.underline}** is
for [manufacturers and product designers to]{.underline} engineer
products that [use **less** or no rare earth elements]{.underline}, or
to [**replace** rare earth elements with new or different
materials.]{.underline} For example, [**BMW** and **Renault** have made
some of their EVs **without r**]{.underline}are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[e]{.underline}**lement**[s]{.underline}**. While this may make
batteries less powerful, cars that are mainly driven in cities may not
need as long a battery life. Recently [Tesla announced that its next
generation of electric motors would use **no r**]{.underline}are
**[e]{.underline}**arth **[e]{.underline}**lement**[s]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [since 2017, the company has]{.underline} [**reduced** its use
of heavy rare earths]{.underline} in its Model 3s [by 25
percent]{.underline}.

[Scientists]{.underline} at Northeastern University are [developing a
substitute material for rare earth magnets called
**tetrataenite**]{.underline}. Tetrataenite is only found in meteorites,
but researchers are trying to recreate a process that took nature
millions of years by rearranging the atomic structure of the material's
nickel and iron components in the lab.

The [scientists have a \$2.1 million grant from the
**D**]{.underline}epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[E]{.underline}**nergy to understand how magnetic materials made of
"non-critical elements" are created in nature.

[Researchers]{.underline} at the Critical Materials Institute of Ames
Laboratory [are]{.underline} also [studying **magnet
substitutes**]{.underline}. They have [developed ways of predicting
which materials have the **potential** to be made into
magnets]{.underline}. They identify those with some attraction to a
magnetic field, then add alloys to turn the materials into permanent
magnets. The scientists found that [this process could make forms of
cerium cobalt]{.underline} (cerium is an abundant rare earth element)
[capable of substituting for **neodymium** and **dysprosium** used in
the strongest rare earth magnets]{.underline}.

**[[Every degree]{.underline}]{.mark}** of warming up to 2°C [[will
**add**]{.underline}]{.mark} at least 1.3 meters [[to]{.mark} sea
levels]{.underline} from accelerated ice flow into the ocean [and
melting from]{.underline} the Antarctic Ice Sheet, while
**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 2°C and 6°C is predicted to
add 2.4 meters per degree (Garbe, Albrecht, Levermann, Donges and
Winkelmann, 2020).

While the IPCC Working Group III reports frequently refer to
\'cost-effectiveness\', the cost against which the effectiveness is
being assessed never includes the cost that would arise from exceeding a
climate tipping point.

It should also be noted that there are no credible technological
solutions for many climate change impacts: for example, the Arctic and
boreal permafrost contain 1460 to 1600 Gt of organic carbon, almost
twice the carbon in the atmosphere (WMO, 2020), and if gigatonnes of
methane are released from melting permafrost and warming oceans, the
process cannot be reversed.

Fact 3.2: The deadly impacts and costs of increasingly acidifying oceans
are also greatly underestimated.

When [[carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline} combines with seawater it
forms carbonic acid, which [[makes the **ocean**]{.mark} more
**[acidic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since around 1850, the oceans have
absorbed between a third and a half of the CO2 emitted to the
atmosphere. As a result, the average pH of ocean surface waters has
fallen from 8.2 to 8.1 units. This corresponds to a 30% increase in
ocean acidity, a rate of change roughly 10 times faster than any time in
the last 55 million years (CoastAdapt, 2017; Jiang et al., 2023).

If GHG emissions continue at the current rate (the RCP8.5 trajectory),
by the end of the century average pH is projected to decrease by
0.3--0.4 units (∼100%--150% increase in acidity) (Kwiatkowski et al.,
2020). Increasing acidity will make it difficult for marine organisms
such as corals, clams, mussels, crabs, and some plankton, to form
calcium carbonate, the material used to build shells and skeletal
material. [The [**survival** of]{.mark}]{.underline} many microscopic
[**marine [species]{.mark}** [will]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be
**threatened**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Bird, 2023). In addition, [ocean
acidification will [disrupt]{.mark}]{.underline} pelagic **[[food
webs]{.underline}]{.mark}** via the proliferation of toxic algal blooms
(Doney et al., 2020). The increasing degradation of marine food chains
will seriously damage fishing industries and tourism.

[**[Ocean]{.mark}** system[**s** are **not** able to **adapt**
to]{.mark} these **[rapid]{.mark}** changes in [**acidity**---a
process]{.mark} that **[naturally]{.mark}** occurs [over
**millennia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Declining ocean pH levels will
persist as long as concentrations of atmospheric CO2 continue to rise.
The stress on marine organisms will be exacerbated by rising
temperatures and exposure to multiple biogeochemical changes. [[To
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} significant [[harm to]{.underline}]{.mark}
critical marine ecosystems and [[the food]{.mark} security [of
**billions**]{.mark}]{.underline} of people, atmospheric concentrations
of atmospheric [[**CO2** must be]{.mark} rapidly
**[reduced]{.mark}**]{.underline} to at least 320-350 ppm or less (IUCN,
2017).

Fact 3.3: Virtually irreversible tipping points are already being
passed. [Acceleration of]{.underline} the rate of [**[climate]{.mark}**
change [is a real]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[**existential**
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Climate tipping points (CTPs) are irrevocable changes in the climate,
such as the melting of ice sheets, or the dieback of rainforests. [These
are points of **no return**]{.underline}: once glaciers and ecosystems
like coral reefs have disappeared, they cannot be restored. For example,
warming oceans make the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
unavoidable (Naughten, Holland and De Rydt, 2023). Evidence is all
around us that we are nearing or have already crossed CTPs associated
with critical parts of the Earth system---we see catastrophic fires in
rainforests, spreading deserts, degrading ecosystems, and shrinking sea
ice (e.g., Walsh, 2016; Bochow and Boers, 2023; Kim et al., 2023).

Another example is rainfall in Greenland, which has increased by 33%
since 1991, with flooding rain darkening and melting the ice sheet and
baring rocks (Box et al., 2023). However, the accelerating rate of melt
and the positive feedbacks of increasing rainfall and reducing albedo
are not represented in IPCC models.

Armstrong McKay and colleagues (2022) identify six **[[tipping
points]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[are **likely**]{.mark} to be
crossed]{.underline} within the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5°C - 2°C
of warming. **[These are:]{.underline}**

Greenland Ice Sheet collapse

West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse

[**[Coral]{.mark}** reef [die off]{.mark}]{.underline} at low latitudes

[Sudden **[thawing]{.mark}** of [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} in
northern regions

[[Abrupt]{.mark} sea **[ice loss]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Barents
Sea

[Collapse of ocean **circulation** in the]{.underline} high-latitude
North **[Atlantic]{.underline}**

They point out that crossing these climate tipping points can generate
positive feedbacks that will increase the likelihood of crossing other
CTPs. For example, Arctic permafrost may permanently thaw even if
warming stays between 1.1 °C and 1.5°C. Above 1.5°C of warming, losing
the permafrost becomes "likely," and we are currently on track for 2.7°C
of warming in this century. If all the permafrost thawed, [emissions
[would]{.mark} be [equivalent]{.mark} to [**51 times** all]{.mark} GHG
**[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2019.

Alarmingly, the ESCIMO climate model indicates that a self-sustaining
process of permafrost thaw has already begun, which suggests that the
world is already past a point-of-no-return for global warming. This
cycle consists of decreasing surface albedo, increasing water vapour
feedback and increasing thawing of the permafrost, which releases both
methane and carbon dioxide, resulting in even further temperature rises,
and so on. Even after no more man-made GHG are emitted, this cycle will
continue on its own until all carbon is released from permafrost and all
ice is melted (Randers and Goluke, 2020).

The likelihood of passing additional CTPs becomes non-negligible at
\~2°C and increases greatly at \~3°C. Above 2°C the Arctic would very
likely become summer ice-free, and land carbon sink-tosource transitions
would become widespread.

Scientists are detecting warning signs for many CTPs. For example,
researchers have found an almost complete loss of stability of the
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). These currents are
already at their slowest point in at least 1,600 years, and new analysis
indicates that the AMOC could collapse between 2025 and 2095, with a
central estimate of 2050, if global carbon emissions are not reduced
(Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023). This would have catastrophic
consequences, severely disrupting the rains that billions of people
depend on for food in India, South America and West Africa; increasing
storms and lowering temperatures in Europe; and raising sea levels in
the eastern North America (Boers, 2021)

The IPCC's highest-end GHG concentration pathway, RCP 8.5, remains close
to observations in many regions and may eventuate if negative feedback
loops are activated, such as emissions from melting permafrost and
forest die-backs (Schwalm, Glendon and Duffy, 2020). Both of the
high-emission pathways considered in the IPCC's most recent Working
Group I report contain 4°C increases in the "very likely" range for 2081
through 2100, temperatures that many scientists believe would pose a
significant threat to civilization (Steel, DesRoches, Mintz-Woo, 2022).

Tipping elements have been identified in all earth systems including
cryosphere, ocean circulation systems and the biosphere, and [a growing
risk is]{.underline} that even if the Paris Agreement targets are met,
[[a **cascade**]{.mark} of]{.underline} positive [feedbacks [could
**push**]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} System irreversibly
[[onto a]{.mark} "**[Hothouse]{.mark} Earth**"
[path]{.mark}way]{.underline} (Steffen et al. 2018; Klose, Karle,
Winkelmann and Donges, 2020). During the last glacial period abrupt
climate changes sometimes occurred within decades, with temperatures
over the Greenland ice-sheet warming by 8°C to 16°C at each event
(Corrick et al., 2020).

The IPCC has been cautious in its evaluation of climate tipping points.
For example, its latest report stated that there was a chance of a
tipping point in the Amazon by the year 2100. However, while most
studies only focus on one driver of destruction, such as climate change
or deforestation, in reality ecosystems are simultaneously impacted by
multiple interacting threats, e.g., water stress, degradation and
pollution. [Because [tipping points]{.mark} can]{.underline} amplify and
[[**accelerate** one **another**]{.underline}]{.mark}, more than a fifth
of [eco[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} worldwide, including the Amazon
rainforest, [are at **[risk]{.mark}** of a catastrophic [**breakdown**
within a]{.mark} single **[human life]{.mark}**]{.underline}time
(Willcock et al., 2023). Record drought in Amazonia in 2023 suggests [we
are **much closer** to these]{.underline} thresholds [than models
**predict**]{.underline}.

Fact 3.4: [[It is **impossible** to adapt]{.mark} to
irreversible]{.underline}, catastrophic [impacts]{.underline} like
species extinction, the loss of glaciers, rising sea levels, and the
release of methane from permafrost and oceans.

IPCC scenarios assume that if overshoot occurs, temperatures can be
returned to safe levels by 2100 through large-scale CDR (Anderson,
2015). The caveat is that [**many** of [the]{.mark}
proposed]{.underline} CDR [**[measures]{.mark}** may [not be
**politically** and]{.mark}]{.underline}/or
**[[techn]{.underline}]{.mark}**olog[[**ically**
feasible]{.underline}]{.mark} (IPCC, 2018). [**Most** policy
makers]{.underline} also [assume]{.underline} that most
[human]{.underline} and environmental [systems will]{.underline} be able
to **[adapt]{.underline}** to a few degrees of higher temperatures
without serious consequences. Unfortunately, both
[assumptions]{.underline} are questionable and [**don't match**
available **evidence**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2018).

Many changes will be irreversible. For example, the International
Cryosphere Climate Initiative points out that while it will only take a
global mean temperature increase of around 1.6°C to melt most of the
Greenland Ice Sheet, it will take another ice age to replace the lost
ice (ICCI, 2015; Bochow et al., 2023).

Climate change has already driven some species to extinction and is
expected to drive many more species and ecosystems towards tipping
points that are beyond their adaptive capacity (RománPalacios and Wiens,
2020). The IPCC notes that: "Extinction of species is an irreversible
impact of climate change, with increasing risk as global temperatures
rise (very high confidence). The median values for percentage of species
at very high risk of extinction...are 9% at 1.5°C rise in GSAT, 10% at
2°C, 12% at 3.0°C, 13% at 4°C and 15% at 5°C (high confidence), with the
likely range of estimates having a maximum of 14% at 1.5°C and rising to
a maximum of 48% at 5°C." (IPCC, 2022, p. 202)

For a foretaste of the future, we can look at how climate change has
already increased wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned
area (MacCarthy, Tyukavina, Weisse and Harris, 2022). For example, the
megafires that engulfed south-eastern Australia in 2019--2020 were so
intense that they burned habitats rarely exposed to fire, killing or
displacing nearly three billion mammals, reptiles, birds, and frogs
(WWF, 2020). Counting tiny invertebrates, 120 trillion creatures died in
the fires (Gibb and Porch, 2023). These fires do irreversible damage:
complex forest ecosystems cannot adapt to fires of this scale and
intensity, and their thousands of interconnected species cannot be
repopulated by human interventions.

Extinction is forever, and losing many keystone species and critical
ecosystems will do catastrophic damage not only to the environment, but
also to our human societies, which utterly depend on the biosphere for
health and sustenance. Tragically, since it is impossible to adapt to
these catastrophes, most politicians find it easier to pretend that each
crisis is an aberration, rather than early warnings of an ever more
deadly trend.

Fact 3.5: Incomplete accounting is resulting in fundamentally flawed
assessments of risks and costs.

The current approach to managing climate change risks is fundamentally
flawed because the risks and costs of failing are likely catastrophic
and therefore unacceptable (Kemp, Xu, Depledge, Lenton 2022; Kimball,
2022).

As David Spratt points out, "The fact that the IPCC incorporates in its
core business risks of failure to the Earth system and to human
civilisation that we would not accept in our own lives raises
fundamental questions about the efficacy of the whole IPCC project....
IPCC carbon budgets regularly include risks of failure (overshooting the
target) of 33% or 50%, that is, a one-in-two or one-in-three risk of
failure. Thus a 2-degree carbon budget with a 50% chance actually has a
10% risk of ending up with 4 degrees of warming, which is incompatible
with the maintenance of human civilization.

"These are risks of failure that no government or person would agree to
in any other aspect of life --- whether it be buildings and bridges,
safety fences or car seats --- where acceptable failure rates are tiny
fractions of one per cent. The fact that the IPCC incorporates in its
core business risks of failure to the Earth system and to human
civilisation that we would not accept in our own lives raises
fundamental questions about the efficacy of the whole IPCC project."
(Spratt, 2023)

Robert Pindyck argues that the integrated assessment models
(**[[IAMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) used to estimate the social cost of
carbon (SCC) and evaluate alternative abatement policies [have **crucial
flaws**: some inputs]{.underline} (such as the discount rate) [[are
**arbitrary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but have huge effects on the models'
final estimates; the [[models]{.mark}\']{.underline} descriptions of the
[impact of **climate** change [are **ad hoc**,
without]{.mark}]{.underline} theoretical or [[**empirical**
foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}; and the models ignore the most
important driver of the SCC, the possibility of a catastrophic climate
outcome. "IAM-based analyses of climate policy create a perception of
knowledge and precision, but that perception is illusory and
misleading." (Pindyck, 2013)

A major problem with [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} cost-benefit
**[models]{.underline}** is that they [[estimate]{.underline}]{.mark}
future [climate [damage based on]{.mark}]{.underline} the analyses of
[**[past weather]{.mark}** impacts]{.underline} (Pezzey, 2019). The
evaluation of climate risks needs to take into account not only linear
developments and their impacts, but also likely non-linear developments
since climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping
elements, and climate-economic shocks may be the largest contributors to
the costs of climate change (Kopp, Shwom, Wagner and Yuan, 2016). The
economist Nicholas Stern (2016) argues that while these hard-to-predict
estimates are difficult to estimate, future IPCC reports need to take
them into account as they have the most troubling potential
consequences. Another area that deserves more attention is the
higher-risk scenarios, which are less predictable but also hold more
devastating implications.

A study conducted by William Nordhaus noted, 'Natural scientists'
estimates \[of the damages from climate change\] were 20--30 times
higher than mainstream economists'' (Nordhaus, 1994, p. 49).
Nevertheless, the IPCC 2014 report reflects the economists' conservative
outlook: "For most economic sectors, the impact of climate change will
be small relative to the impacts of other drivers (medium evidence, high
agreement). Changes in population, age, income, technology, relative
prices, lifestyle, regulation, governance, and many other aspects of
socioeconomic development will have an impact on the supply and demand
of economic goods and services that is large relative to the impact of
climate change." (Arent et al., 2014, p. 662)

After summarizing the peer-reviewed economic literature, the 2022 IPCC
Report concluded that: "warming of \~4°C may cause a 10--23% decline in
annual global GDP by 2100 relative to global GDP without warming." (IPCC
2022, p. 2459) In contrast, Pearce and Parncutt (2023) argue that global
warming of even 2 °C will kill approximately 1 billion (mainly poorer)
humans, and many climate scientists argue that the impact of even a 3°C
increase could be "catastrophic" (e.g., Kemp et al. 2022).

DeFries et al. (2019) suggest that IPCC economic assessments of the
potential future risks of climate change grossly underestimate many of
the most serious consequences because these risks are difficult to
quantify precisely and lie outside of human experience.

Steve Keen suggests that it would have been prudent for the IPCC to have
climate scientists peer review the climate change assumptions made in
economic papers, as most economists have little expertise in the area.
Instead, referees with expertise only in economics approved the
publication of economic impact assessments that climate scientists would
almost certainly have disputed. As a result, the empirical components of
the vast majority of climate change economic papers are based on
scientifically false assumptions that drastically underestimate the
likely economic damages of climate change (Keen, 2023).

Keen believes that the reasons why economists' estimates of future
climate change damage have been much more optimistic than the forecasts
of scientists is because economists used three spurious methods to
estimate damage: assuming that about 90% of GDP will be unaffected by
climate change, because it happens indoors; using the relationship
between temperature and GDP today as a proxy for the future impacts of
global warming; and using surveys that dilute extreme warnings from
scientists with optimistic expectations from economists. "Correcting for
these errors makes it feasible that the economic damages from climate
change are at least an order of magnitude worse than forecast by
economists, and may be so great as to threaten the survival of human
civilization." (Keen, 2020)

Section 4: IPCC assessments are wrong

Fallacy 4: Climate models represent all possible future risks from
climate change, and IPCC assessments and international agreements are
objective and accurate

Fact 4.1: The Paris Agreement has created confusion by focusing on
maximum acceptable temperatures, rather than on the need to reduce the
EEI.

The ultimate objective of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol is "to stabilize GHG
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous
human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows
ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development."
(UNFCCC, 2023). However, the IPCC moved from an atmospheric
stabilization target to an average surface temperature target, in order
to keep having achievable targets, mostly with an "inspirational"
objective. The result is that rather than focusing attention on reducing
the EEI, the Paris Agreement negotiated temperature goals that are
dangerously high, unsafe, unstable and probably unachievable with the
proposed policies.

Temperature targets became acceptable with a scientific and political
convergence on defining 2°C as a boundary beyond which there would be
risks to many unique threatened ecosystems, a large increase in the
number of extreme weather events, sea level rise and the risk of
triggering dangerous instabilities in the climate system. The 2°C target
has become a critical part of the EU, UN Conference of Parties, and
other organizations policies, both because it provides a clear goal for
(gradual) decarbonization efforts, and because it suggests that
temperature rises below this target can be safely managed.

The IPCC's fourth assessment report from 2007 (AR4) stated that in order
to keep global average surface temperature increases at 2°C to 2.4 °C
above pre-industrial values by the end of this century, atmospheric
emissions need to be stabilized at 445 to 490 ppm of CO2e (IPCC, 2007).
AR4 also stated that in order to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of
CO2e at 450 ppm, anthropogenic CO2 emissions needed to peak in 2015, and
Annex I countries would have to make emission reductions of 25--40% by
2020, and 80--95% by 2050. Even though the 450 ppm CO2e threshold was
exceeded by 2014, this analysis provided the basis for subsequent UNFCCC
negotiations (Lucas, 2021).

Not only is the 2°C target now almost certainly unachievable, but even
the research justifying the 450 ppm CO2e/2°C target is questionable, as
it ignored paleoclimate research on the relationship between GHG
concentrations and temperatures (Hansen et al. 2020; Lucas, 2021a). (See
section 4.2)

Research by Katrina von Schuckmann et al. (2020) concluded that to
ensure a safe, stable climate, maximum concentrations of GHGes will have
to be reduced to approximately 350 ppm CO2e. Above these levels, rising
temperatures increasingly destabilize the climate system through the
introduction of positive feedbacks.

Proponents of the planetary boundary framework argue that climate change
thresholds should be framed in terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations
rather than temperature (Mathias et al., 2017). Below 350 ppm is safe,
350--550 ppm is dangerous, and above 550 ppm is catastrophic.

Fact 4.2: Most [[models do **not** include]{.mark} long-term
**[feedbacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} identified in paleoclimate research,
and thus do not simulate the full climatic responses evident in the
Earth's climatic history.

Because there is little pre-industrial data, and due to the focus on
shorter timescales, most models ignore [[the **paleo**]{.mark}climatic
**[record]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, historical evidence
[[indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [high **[GHG]{.mark}**
concentration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} are likely to
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} much [**[higher temp]{.mark}**erature[**s**
than]{.mark}]{.underline} are [indicated by [current
**modelling**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact,
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [**[present]{.mark}**
anthropogenic **[carbon]{.mark}** release [**rate** has no
precedent]{.mark} since the
**P**]{.underline}alaeocene--**[E]{.underline}**ocene
**[T]{.underline}**hermal **[M]{.underline}**aximum 66 million years
ago, some scientists argue that [[climate]{.mark}
conditions]{.underline} are increasingly entering 'no-analogue' state
that [[**cannot** be]{.underline}]{.mark} readily
**[[modelled]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Zeebe, Ridgwell and Zachos 2016;
Lear et al. 2020).

Most of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} early **[[data]{.underline}]{.mark}**
used [[in IPCC]{.mark} models [is]{.mark} from the **19th
century**]{.underline}, a time-frame that may be [[too short to
**enable**]{.mark} accurate **[forecasts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Based
on assessments of climate dynamics over the last 66- million-years,
James Hansen and his colleagues argue that more than [[**80%**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[warming from]{.underline}]{.mark} past GHG
[[emissions has **yet to emerge**]{.mark}, once]{.underline} slow
[feedbacks]{.underline} from ice sheet cover, vegetation and long-lived
GHGs other than CO2 (not all of these feedbacks are included in IPCC
models) [are taken into account]{.underline} (Hansen et al., 2023).
These findings would have two major implications: first, that committed
warming from existing concentrations of GHGs will continue to accelerate
especially as the cooling effect from man-made aerosol pollution
declines, potentially reaching 5°C above preindustrial levels by 2100
even when considering emission pathways lower than RCP8.5; and second,
that that global average temperatures will continue to rise over the
next 400 years.

The next 400 years may not matter to currently living beings, but the
period up to 2100 does. Continued global heating would intensify all the
disastrous impacts that are already occurring. The question of elevated
GHG levels has to be seriously addressed: many experts believe that
[tipping **cascades**]{.underline} caused by rising temperatures [could
be an **existential** threat to **civilization**]{.underline} (Lenton et
al, 2019).

Assessments of future risks also need to be better informed by
paleoclimatic precedents. For example, modeling, paleoclimate evidence,
and on-going observations together imply that 2 ◦C global warming above
the preindustrial level could be dangerous (Hansen et al., 2016). Levels
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are 1.5 times higher now than they
were 400,000 years ago, when a large part of Greenland was ice-free: if
Greenland's ice sheet melts completely, sea levels will rise by 7
meters, devastating coastal cities (Paddison, 2023).

125,000 years ago, a brief episode of meltwater-induced weakening of the
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) resulted in a massive
CH4 release (Weldeab et al., 2022): new research warns that there is a
risk that the AMOC may severely slow down during this century, up to the
point of a functional shut down (Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023). Rapid
global warming and accompanying ocean oxygen loss led to the
Permian-Triassic mass extinctions (Penn, Deutsch, Payne and Sperling
2018), and Rothman (2017) estimates that carbon emissions are likely to
reach the tipping point for the next catastrophic mass extinction event
by 2100.

Fact 4.3: Models incorrectly assume that rising temperatures will have
incremental impacts, and that overshoot can be managed with adaptive
measures and reversed within decades.

Due to imperfect representations, especially in the biosphere, of the
dynamics of the climate system, most models project that rising
temperatures will have incremental impacts, and that overshoot can be
managed and reversed. In reality many changes will be irreversible and
catastrophic (e.g., the loss of species and glaciers), and many changes
will be non-linear due to positive feedbacks and exceeding tipping
points. These feedback loops have not yet been modelled in NZE scenarios
(Climate Council, 2021).

IPCC analyses tend to presume that steady decadal average increases in
global average temperatures rises will have incrementally rising global
impacts. Many types of impacts are a result of short-term fluctuations
above the mean, such as very intense storms and extended periods of very
high-heat index. These concentrate their impacts over relatively small
regions, overwhelm plausible adaptive measures, and set back regional
development by decades. It is aperiodic extreme events that lead to the
most damage. The assessments tend to significantly underestimate the
devastating non-linear and long-lasting environmental, economic, and
social disruption that occurs, and this will become especially the case
as the Paris targets are overshot.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report concludes that erratic climate events
will continue throughout this century, with multiple climate hazards
occurring simultaneously, and that multiple climatic and non-climatic
risks will interact, compounding overall risk and causing risks to
cascade across sectors and regions (IPCC, 2021). Nevertheless, although
the IPCC has discussed nonlinear responses in successive assessments and
special reports, the word 'nonlinear' is not mentioned in the AR6
Summary for Policymakers.

Critics within the scientific community also argue that IPCC assessment
reports have failed to capture the speed at which climatic changes have
actually taken place (Pearson et al., 2015), to acknowledge that the
global average temperature is already at a dangerous level, or to
accurately assess the risks and costs associated with overshooting safe
limits. For example, although the IPCC assessed in 2018 that there is
now a high probability that the 1.5°C target will be passed, it
neglected to highlight the probability of catastrophic climate damages
if these temperatures are maintained (Xu and Ramanathan, 2017).

As a result, there is a growing disconnect between how climate risk is
characterized and interpreted by many climate scientists, and the way
the IPCC selects and represents relevant research. Some believe that
critical findings are often been de-emphasised or ignored in the highly
technical reports of Working Group I, or not given due consideration in
the summaries for policymakers compiled by Working Groups II and III
(Lucas, 2021a).

An increasing number of climate scientists argue that a new climate
policy regime is required which takes into account the nonlinearity of
the climate system and which places greater focus on preventing more
tipping points from being crossed over the coming decades (e.g., Lenton
et al., 2019). As Kopp et al. (2017) point out, there have been many
times during the earth's history when the earth's climate has been
pushed past a critical threshold. Frequently this has thrown it into a
period of chaotic fluctuations, after which it has settled into a new
and very different dynamic regime.

It is important to recognize that climate change is only one of multiple
interacting non-linear threats to the global environment: in the
planetary boundary framework (Richardson et al., 2023), many of them
have been declared as transgressed, potentially placing Earth outside of
the safe operating space for humanity (Richardson et al., 2023). The
2023 State of the Climate Report (Ripple et al., 2023) points out that
20 of Earth's 35 vital signs are now showing record extremes. "Life on
planet Earth is under siege. We are now in an uncharted territory.... We
are entering an unfamiliar domain regarding our climate crisis, a
situation no one has ever witnessed firsthand in the history of
humanity."

Fact 4.4: Analyses tend to minimize the likelihood and risks of
high-temperature scenarios, although these are already occurring and are
the most dangerous.

Although the IPCC has published fourteen special reports, none have
covered extreme or catastrophic climate change. Considering temperature
increases alone rather than heat index tends to minimize the seriousness
and risks of high-temperature scenarios, even though it is combined
temperature and humidity increases that most threaten workers and the
public.

In the latest assessment report (AR6), only 14% of the temperature
mentions are above 2°C, although on the current trajectory global
average temperatures will rise more than 2°C (Jehn et al., 2022). These
omissions are especially egregious given that temperatures are already
dangerous with extreme weather events becoming more frequent and
damaging (Di Capua and Rahmstorf, 2023; Davariashtiyani et al., 2023),
and because a number of climate tipping points will almost certainly be
passed in the coming decades. As explained in Section 3, passing tipping
points will have irreversible, catastrophic consequences.

It is far too soon to count on the success of current mitigation
efforts. Both of the high-emission pathways considered in the most
recent IPCC report contain 4°C increases in the "very likely" range for
2081 through 2100. Many scientists believe that these temperatures would
pose a significant threat to civilization.

[Alarms should be **ringing** as [the IPCC]{.mark}'s [**highest**
GHG]{.mark}]{.underline} concentration [**[pathway]{.mark}**, RCP 8.5,
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} for [[now **close**]{.mark} to observations.
[While]{.mark} its **[future]{.mark}**]{.underline} carbon [[emissions
might be]{.mark} on the **[high]{.mark}** end]{.underline} compared to
current proposed policies, [[it may]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[become]{.mark} a **[likely]{.mark}**]{.underline} scenario [[due to

[**[feedbacks]{.mark}** such as]{.underline} emissions from melting
**[permafrost]{.underline}**, changes in [**soil** carbon]{.underline}
dynamics, [and]{.underline} changes to **[forest fire]{.underline}**
frequency and severity (Schwalm, Glendon and Duffy, 2020). Furthermore,
[many]{.underline} of the IPCC [**l[ow emission]{.mark}** [scenarios
assume]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[phasing out **fossil**]{.mark}
fuel[**s**,]{.mark} but]{.underline} the sustained large-scale
deployment of CDR technologies [that may **[not]{.mark}** be
technologically or [economically **feasible**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Steel, DesRoches, and Mintz-Woo, 2022).

Luke Kemp and colleagues point out that the IPCC focus on lower-end
warming is mismatched to the risks and potential damages posed by
climate change. "We know that temperature rise has "fat tails":
low-probability, high-impact extreme outcomes. Climate damages are
likely to be nonlinear and result in an even larger tail.... Prudent
risk management demands that we thoroughly assess worst-case scenarios."
(Kemp et al., 2022) They suggest that the IPCC reports focus on
lower-end warming and simple risk analyses out of a desire to support
the Paris Agreement goals of limiting warming to well below 2 °C.

Other reasons are the culture of climate science to "err on the side of
least drama" and avoid alarmism (Brysse et al., 2013). This is
compounded by the consensus processes of the IPCC (Oppenheimer et al.,
2019), which many scientists argue leads to reaching agreement around
the "lowest common denominator". Even lead authors in the fourth
Assessment Report have criticised that "in the effort to reach
consensus, some key details and high-risk scenarios were not fully
explored" (Hoppe and Rödder, 2019). While complex risk assessments are
more realistic, they are also more difficult to conduct. Nevertheless,
as the IPCC notes, climate risks are becoming more complex and difficult
to manage, and are cascading across regions and sectors (IPCC, 2021).

British economist Nicholas Stern says: "Scientists describe the scale of
the risks from unmanaged climate change as potentially immense. However,
the scientific models, because they omit key factors that are hard to
capture precisely, appear to substantially underestimate these risks.
Many economic models add further gross underassessment of risk because
the assumptions built into the economic modeling on growth, damages and
risks, come...close to excluding the possibility of catastrophic
outcomes. A new generation of models is needed in all three of climate
science, impact and economics\..." (Stern, 2013).

The approach of the IPCC and most governments has been to treat climate
change as an economic problem that can be primarily managed through
market forces (e.g., cf. UNFCCC, 2023), rather than as an existential
threat to our collective survival that will require urgent government
interventions (e.g., limiting emissions). In emergencies, effectiveness
is prioritised over cost effectiveness: the reason why governments
usually operate militaries, police, fire departments, and other
emergency services. This is a vital distinction as markets do not have
the capacity to respond to climate change at the speed and scale needed
to prevent dangerous impacts.

Non-linear dynamics greatly increase risk (e.g., Gunderson and Holling,
2002; Barnosky et al., 2012). For example, Liu et al. (2023) have found
strong correlations between tipping elements in regions as diverse as
the Amazon Rainforest Area, the Tibetan Plateau and West Antarctic ice
sheet. Their study shows the potential predictability of cascading
tipping dynamics.

"A major concern for the world's ecosystems is the possibility of
collapse, where landscapes and the societies they support change
abruptly. Accelerating stress levels, increasing frequencies of extreme
events and strengthening intersystem connections suggest that
conventional modelling approaches based on incremental changes in a
single stress may provide poor estimates of the impact of climate and
human activities on ecosystems.... Prudent risk management clearly
requires consideration of the factors that may lead to these
bad-to-worst-case scenarios." (Willcock et al., 2023).

In particular, there is a need to shift from conventional risk
assessment, which is focused on the likelihood and potential harm of
individual events, to systemic risk assessment, which focuses on the
risk or probability of breakdowns in an entire system (Lawrence et al.,
2023; Monbiot, 2023). \[See Fact 4.3\]

Fact 4.5: Because IPCC reports are developed through a political process
requiring consensus, many key issues are downplayed or ignored.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has done indispensable
work in collating peer-reviewed studies, and identifying key issues and
trends for the consideration of policymakers. Their periodic assessment
reports summarize the efforts of thousands of the world's best
scientists. Nevertheless, the IPCC's summary reports are fundamentally
flawed.

Although the IPCC's scientific inputs are not directly manipulated or
biased by politicians, the summary reports are arrived at by consensus
of governments, not scientists---a process that allows governments to
change or veto the content at the very last step of communication with
policymakers and the public (e.g., Westervelt, 2022)---many key issues
are either entirely ignored or downplayed. These include the dangers of
passing climate tipping points, the role of fossil fuel interests in
obstructing mitigation efforts, and the need for humanity to shift away
from meat-based diets.

For example, fossil fuels are mentioned in only seven, and livestock in
only three of the first 27 climate summits. In regards to fossil fuels,
the only actions the summaries propose are increasing efficiency and
"management", and other than phasing down "unabated" coal burning,
nowhere is there a word about reducing oil or gas production and
consumption. "It's as though nuclear nonproliferation negotiators had
decided not to talk about bombs. You cannot address an issue if you will
not discuss it." (Monbiot,2022a)

The Paris Agreement is another example. David Spratt points out that
while it avoids discussing the causes of climate change and contains no
reference to "coal", "oil", "fracking", "shale oil" or "fossil fuel",
nor to "ban", "prohibit" or "stop", it refers more than eighty times to
"adaptation". "Emphasis is given to speculative, but potentially
highly-profitable, market-based solutions.... \[such as\] carbon capture
and storage, a technological imaginary that would pay oil and gas
producers to pump gigantic volumes of carbon dioxide into wells they
have emptied of fossil fuels. The focus is on the "efficiency" of the
market; in the IPCC's most recent Working Group 3 report, the expression
"cost-effectiveness" is mentioned 173 times." (Spratt, 2022, p. 124)

Another egregious omission is food production, which produces a third of
all GHGs (Crippa et al., 2021). Over half of this pollution comes from
raising livestock (Xu et al., 2021; Blaustein-Rejto and Gambino, 2023),
which is more than the direct emissions from ships, planes, trucks, cars
and all other transport put together (Bailey, Froggatt and Wellesley,
2014). Emissions from livestock production are projected to grow by
\~70% by 2050 as the global population nears 10 billion and diets shift
to incorporate more meat (Ivanovich, Sun, Gordon & Ocko, 2023).

Fossil fuel, food industry and other lobbies are effectively ensuring
that discussion of many critical climate change causes and solutions are
censored from the final IPCC summaries. Because emerging technologies
are an enormous threat to vested agricultural interests, policy makers
are not told of the existence of non-polluting alternatives to
industrial agriculture, such as creating food products with precision
fermentation processes. For example, proteins produced by feeding
microbes hydrogen or methanol in vats require 1,700 times less land than
soy, and 138,000 and 157,000 times less land than beef and lamb
(Monbiot, 2022b).

Replacing livestock production with meat alternatives would not only cut
GHG emissions and reduce animal suffering, but prevent the further
destruction of rainforests and permit the rewilding and ecological
restoration of the vast tracts now used to raise and feed livestock.
Restoring forests, wetlands, savannahs, natural grasslands, mangroves,
reefs and sea floors would enable us to simultaneously stop the sixth
great extinction, and draw down much of the atmospheric carbon heating
the planet.

However, COP27 was not focused on changing human diets but rather on
cows' diets (to lower their CH4 emissions), and not on replacing
polluting synthetic fertilizers with sustainable agricultural practices
(e.g., regenerative agriculture), but instead on increasing fertilizer
efficiency and use (Lakhani, 2022). Given that corporate lobbyists
outnumbered delegates from developing countries and civil society
organizations (Michaelson, 2022), and that fossil fuel producing
countries have systematically vetoed any agreement on reducing fossil
fuels through 27 successive UNFCCC COPs, it is not surprising that no
mention was made of the need to reduce oil and gas production, or the
need to cut the massive farm subsidies found to harm human and
environmental health (Carrington, 2021). The lobbyists' efforts were
supported by large delegations from fossil fuel and meat producing
countries.

International climate policies are primarily the result of compromises
made by governments under pressure from powerful polluting industries
and their political and business allies (Lucas, 2021b). In particular,
the governments of fossil fuel producing countries have acted as
spoilers in international climate negotiations. This opposition was
demonstrated at the 2019 UN Environment Assembly, when the United States
and Saudi Arabia blocked a Swiss proposal to assess potential
geoengineering methods and governance frameworks (Reynolds, 2019).

This process is demonstrated by the United Arab Emirates selection of
Sultan Al Jaber as president of the COP28 climate talks, which the
oil-rich state hosted. Al Jaber, a UAE minister and climate envoy,
headed both the renewable energy company Masdar and the state-owned Abu
Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), which is one of the biggest oil
companies in the world. The Sultan's multiple roles illustrate the
strategy of many fossil fuel producers, which is to maximise oil and gas
production and sales for as long as possible, while simultaneously
positioning their companies for the inevitable transition to clean
energies. Unsurprisingly, Al Jaber's appointment outraged climate
activists (Hart, 2023).

Political compromises have produced systematic biases in the kinds of
expertise and evidence that national governments are prepared to accept
via the IPCC and UNFCCC frameworks. Because the IPCC primarily focuses
on summarizing and evaluating research from the earth sciences and
economics, critical and contextual perspectives and approaches are
excluded, producing outcomes that favour the interests of economically
dominant industries and businesses. The reductionist and technocratic
disciplinary composition of the IPCC, biases it towards endorsing
incremental and voluntary change and supposedly low cost but universally
applicable economic 'solutions' (Lucas, 2021b).

Governments have also tasked IPCC with examining only the short-term
impacts of climate change, not the long-term impacts (scenarios rarely
look past 2100). This political decision is fundamentally flawed from a
scientific point of view, as it effectively produces underestimations of
impacts and risks.

Another reason that there has been little action on climate change is
because higher-income countries want to maintain their economic
dominance. For example, the late Saleemul Huq pointed out that the IPCC
is only allowed to discuss "loss and damage" instead of talking about
the real issue of "liability and compensation" for poor countries
suffering the climate impacts caused by emissions from industrialized
countries (Thunberg, 2022). The US recently stated that it will not
\"under any circumstances\" pay reparations to developing countries hit
by climate change-fuelled disasters (Slow, 2023).

Fact 4.6: Risk assessments need to be informed by reality as evidenced
by current and past data.

Following the release of the final instalment of the IPCC's Sixth
Assessment Report (AR6) on April 4 2022, United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres commented that it was "a litany of
broken climate promises ... a file of shame." He then called for a
redoubling of efforts, saying that "Choices made by countries now will
make or break the commitment to 1.5 degrees." IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee
echoed his words: "We are at a crossroads.... There are policies,
regulations and market instruments that are proving effective. If these
are scaled up and applied more widely and equitably, they can support
deep emissions reductions and stimulate innovation." Jim Skea, co-chair
of Working Group III (and the new IPCC chair) added: "It's now or never,
if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Without immediate and deep
emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible." (WEO,
2022)

Unfortunately, not only is the 1.5°C target no longer achievable, but it
could not create a safe or stable climate. The grim reality is that the
world is already experiencing dangerous, irreversible climate impacts,
and rising temperatures can only make the climate increasingly unstable
and dangerous.

Good science is based on empirical observations and testable
explanations. If a hypothesis fails to reflect real developments, it has
to be discarded and replaced with a better hypothesis. So, a good
question is why and how has the IPCC has managed to turn its scientific
assessments into arguments for continuing with an obviously failing
mitigation strategy in pursuit of clearly unworkable targets?

The IPCC's methodology conceals the fact that the basics of climate
change science are straightforward and have been settled for decades. In
a statement to the US Congress in 1988, James Hansen explained the
impacts CO2 emissions have on global temperatures, and predicted the
current situation. At the time his analysis was widely accepted,
including by ExxonMobil's own scientists.

Hansen's forecasts have proven to be more accurate than the IPCC's, and
as Jackson Damian says, "Thirty-five years on, it is now blindingly
obvious you can't radically alter the chemistry of the atmosphere, melt
75% of Arctic sea ice plus epic quantities of ice/permafrost elsewhere,
increase ocean temperatures, alter jet streams...without causing the
climate to catastrophically change faster than ever before." (Damian,
2023)

Now James Hansen says of the record 2023 heatwaves, "There's a lot more
in the pipeline, unless we reduce the GHG amounts. These superstorms are
a taste of the storms of my grandchildren. We are headed wittingly into
the new reality -- we knew it was coming. It means we are damned
fools\-- we have to taste it to believe it." (Milman, 2023)
Nevertheless, despite a constant stream of scientific studies warning
that the global climate is rapidly destabilizing, IPCC summaries keep
arguing that current policies, if fully implemented, can avert dangerous
climate change.

Instead of focusing on hypothetical scenarios, we need to look at
reality as evidenced by present and past data. The paleoclimate data
proves that the climate sensitivity of temperature and sea level to CO2
is much higher than the models indicate. This is because of the failure
of the models to adequately describe complex climate dynamics (Lucas,
2021a).

Hans Joachim Schellnhuber criticizes the IPCC for having [[a]{.mark}
\"**[probability obsession]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}, which [[makes
**little sense**]{.mark} because \"[we are in a **unique
situation**]{.mark} with no]{.underline} precise [historic
**analogue**]{.underline}.\" (Spratt and Dunlop, 2017, p. 3) While
calculating [[probabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} can be useful, it [[is
**impossible** in]{.underline}]{.mark} the most [critical instances,
such as]{.underline} the CH4-release dynamics in [thawing

[The]{.underline} scientific **[data]{.underline}** that [the **IPCC**
uses is]{.underline} also often **[out of date]{.underline}**, due to
the slowness of the process and the mode of work -- through no fault of
the scientists. For example, 'Working Group One' (WG1) is responsible
for advising humanity on the 'present state' of the climate and future
trajectories, based on scientifically-verified data. The WG1 report date
was February 2021, two years in advance of the end of their 7-year
reporting cycle. This means that the AR6 assessments ignored all
scientific reports published after 2020, and because studies take at
least a year to complete, the latest data they referenced was from
before 2019. (The next global stock-take---AR7---will not take place
until 2028.)

[As a result]{.underline}, important [[science is **missing**,

Recent research also warns that the Atlantic meridional overturning

around mid-century---a catastrophic event that would have severe impacts
on the climate in the North Atlantic region (Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen,

In general, CMIP models are not adept at analysing non-linear processes.

should be alarmed because [the [IPCC]{.mark} **models** are [just **not

#### The plan's green tech investment is also key to growth.

**Colson 22** \[Dana, 12/8/2022, \"The Use of Green Technology Will
Impact the Economy\"
https://www.transformationholdings.com/environment/the-use-of-green-technology-will-impact-the-economy/\]
//anirudh

The use of green technology has led to [[**significant reductions**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
greenhouse gas emissions. These reductions result from [[**increased
efficiency** in]{.underline}]{.mark} both residential and [[industrial
sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The use of green technology has enabled the use of [[renewable
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as solar and wind energy. These
sources are [[**cheaper** than]{.underline}]{.mark} traditional [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} and [provide an alternative to]{.underline}
the increasing use of [**imported** fossil fuels]{.underline}. The use
of green technology is important because it enables people to pay less
for electricity or to heat their homes or offices. Think solar energy.

2\. Cleaner Energy

Using green technology such as wind turbines reduces dependence on
fossil fuels for generating electricity. Using renewable sources such as
hydroelectricity or solar power helps reduce air pollution, which is
important because air pollution is one of the leading contributing
causes of death worldwide.

Moreover, green technology can also be used to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, because it reduces the energy and resources used to create,
store, transport, and use fossil fuels.

The transition to a green economy would not only protect the environment
but also provide sustainable solutions for modern living. In fact, this
shift can be used as an opportunity in order reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels that are highly
polluting and ultimately dangerous, if left unchecked.

In doing so, we free up resources such as oil which could then go
towards developing new technology like solar panels or other
alternatives.

3\. Reduced Need To Purchase Raw Materials For Production

The use of [green technology [reduces]{.mark} the need to purchase
**[raw materials]{.mark}** for production]{.underline}. This can be
achieved by recycling and reusing metals and plastics. This, in turn,
reduces the amount of waste generated, as well as [[reducing]{.mark} the
**[costs]{.mark}**]{.underline} associated with waste disposal.

It also reduces the need to buy new raw materials for production.
Reducing the amount of waste generated in this way also helps reduce the
pollution caused by landfills.

4\. Facilitates Eco-Friendly Agriculture

[[Green tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} is also a means of
[[facilitat]{.mark}ing eco-friendly
**[agriculture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because it reduces the
resources and land needed to grow crops. This reduces the amount of land
taken up by agriculture and helps [reduce]{.underline} soil erosion,
which is one of the leading causes of [soil degradation]{.underline}. It
also reduces the need for fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and
fungicides to grow crops.

Green technology can also [[increase]{.mark} the amount of
**agricultural land** available for [food
production]{.mark}]{.underline}, because it helps reduce the amount of
land needed for farming and helps improve soil quality. [It
also]{.underline} helps to prevent soil erosion and desertification, two
of the most serious environmental issues affecting the economy.

5\. Increased Efficiency

Green technology [helps us become]{.underline} more [**efficient**
with]{.underline} our **[resources]{.underline}** and resources, [which
translates into **[increased efficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
economy. For instance, it takes [[less time to
**manufacture**]{.underline}]{.mark} a product that uses 80 percent
recycled material than a product made only of virgin materials. Reducing
energy consumption also reduces the cost per unit produced, which
translates into [[lower **costs** for consumers]{.underline}]{.mark} at
large.

Therefore, this [[translates into]{.mark} higher [economic growth
**worldwide**]{.mark}]{.underline} as [[it spurs **demand** for green
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} products and services and
[[increases]{.mark} their **[affordability]{.mark}** over traditional
commodities]{.underline} such as petroleum-based resources.

As the use of green technology becomes more widespread,
[[we]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[expect]{.underline}]{.mark} to see [[a
**positive impact** on the economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This increase
in efficiency will lead to increased productivity and lower costs,
[[benefiting]{.mark} both **[businesses and
consumers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In turn, [this will [create **jobs**
and spur **innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, further boosting the
economy.

2022.

After 200 years of fossil fuel expansion, [[we are at a turning point in
the global energy system]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Fossil fuels are
getting]{.underline}]{.mark} less attractive and [[more
costly]{.underline}]{.mark} everyday (even without carbon taxes), as
investment opportunities in renewables and energy efficiency become more
and more appealing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in their
recent World Energy Outlook has done an about-face and is now predicting
that [[fossil fuel emissions will peak by 2025]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Putin's war in Ukraine and OPEC's recent price hike has exposed the
fragility of an energy system dependent upon fossil fuel supply chains.
While there has been a temporary bump in production of oil and gas to
respond to the emergency, the golden age of natural gas is over and will
be replaced by cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable energy sources.

A new report by BloombergNEF finds that [[87 countries have now reached
clean energy tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline} with accelerated
adoption of 10 critical technologies. The U.S. despite political
intransigence, managed to go from 5% to 20% renewable power in just 10
years. Solar is now 33% cheaper on average than natural gas, and Xcel
just set a record in Colorado --- a utility solar project with storage
at 4.5 cents per kWh (3 cents with subsidies), far below any form of
fossil fuel generation. China single-handedly quadrupled global offshore
wind capacity in a single year. And for the naysayers that continue to
harp on about the environmental impacts of renewables, detailed analysis
has shown that the harmful externalities associated with solar and wind
energy are almost imperceptible relative to those of fossil fuels.

In fact, the [[University of Oxford]{.underline}]{.mark} in a new
**[study]{.mark}** shows that transitioning to 100% renewables would
result in \$12 trillion in energy savings by 2050 versus our current
energy system. So effectively, solving climate change pays for itself
many times over. The EU is beginning to experience the clean energy
windfall first hand, with \$29 billion in savings this past summer due
to expanded solar power deployment. Kingsmill Bond at the Rocky Mountain
Institute lays out a Theory on Rapid Transition and why it spells a
decade of opportunity for some investors and a decade of pain for those
wedded to their soon-to-be stranded fossil fuel assets.

2\. The Climate Economy is about to explode with an influx of public
funding.

[[Global climate finance per year from both public and private sources,
projected to have reached \$850 billion in 2021]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Source: Climate Policy Initiative, 2022.

I don't think people have fully grasped the magnitude of the passing of
the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has at its center the
single largest commitment of public dollars to address climate change to
date --- well over \$800B in potential funding. Robinson Meyer's
excellent piece in The Atlantic entitled " The Climate Economy is about
to explode" breaks down how this will have enormous ripple effects
globally, as international supply chains compete for those U.S. clean
energy dollars and other governments ramp up their own stimulus
packages. [[California]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[just
signed]{.underline}]{.mark} into law [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} whopping
[[\$54 billion stimulus for climate solutions]{.underline}]{.mark},
which is expected to create 4 million new jobs and cut pollution by 60%
by 2030. And at the G20 summit, Indonesia signed a \$20 billion deal
with the U.S. to accelerate its clean energy transition.

The Climate Policy Institute, which tracks finance flows for mitigation
and adaptation efforts globally, is now projecting a record \$850
billion in total investments in climate change solutions in 2021, with
half coming from public funding sources. This is roughly equivalent to
all global fossil fuel investments (which have been steadily declining).
When the numbers come in for 2022, we will have officially reached an
inflection point with climate investments exceeding fossil investments.
And it will rapidly accelerate from here on out as many countries eye
windfall taxes to capture and redirect some of the exorbitant
inflationary revenue reaped by companies like Exxon and Chevron (both of
which recently posted a 280% jump in profits). [[Green Bonds
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[taking off]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[now]{.underline}]{.mark} representing [[a total of \$1.8
trillion]{.underline}]{.mark} in issuances, and they could [[climb to
\$5 trillion by 2025]{.underline}]{.mark} (PDF).

We're also seeing Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) and Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs) get in the game. The One Planet Sovereign
Wealth Funds Network, launched by President Macron just a few years ago,
has now grown to 45+ of the world's largest institutional investors with
more than \$37 trillion worth of assets. This is a significant
milestone, as SFWs have historically been a major driver in continued
fossil fuel expansion. The network includes petrostates like the UAE,
which hosted an annual gathering for the network in October, focusing on
the clean energy transition. Concurrently, there is a new push for MDBs
to open the floodgates of capital through relatively modest shifts in
lending policies. An influential G20 report lays out a pathway for the
development banks to relax their overly strict risk and capitalization
requirements without losing their coveted AAA credit ratings. When
implemented, this would unlock trillions to facilitate the clean energy
transition in the developing world.

3\. [[Private capital is flooding in, as climate becomes a major focus

For traditional digital tech companies, we've seen massive layoffs and
capital constriction. But the [[climate tech sector is absolutely
booming]{.underline}]{.mark}. Overall, climate tech venture capital
reached 2.5x pre-pandemic investment levels in 2021 and it shows no
signs of slowing down as the traditional tech sector declines. A new
analysis by CB Insights found that in Q3 of this year, 50% of the
biggest VC deals were in climate tech. These companies span the gamut of
solutions --- from renewable power and green fuels, to "nature tech"
companies that advance forest conservation, to water processing
technologies and climate-friendly agricultural solutions. The recently
launched Climate Finance Tracker led by Vibrant Data Labs (housed at One
Earth), tracks the new influx of private capital into climate
investments, and ImpactAlpha is indexing an growing collection of
stories on the new universe of investible opportunities in the climate
space.

These political hurdles are formidable. The good news is that
[technological progress]{.underline} can [make it]{.underline} much
**[easier]{.underline}** to clear them by [driving **down** the costs of
**action**]{.underline}. In the decades to come,
[innovation]{.underline} could [make]{.underline} [**severe** cuts in
**emissions**]{.underline}, also known as "**[deep
decarbonization]{.underline}**," [achievable at reasonable
costs]{.underline}. That will mean reshaping about ten sectors in the
global economy---including electric power, transportation, and parts of
agriculture---by reinforcing positive change where it is already
happening and investing heavily wherever it isn't.

In a few sectors, especially electric power, [a major
transformation]{.underline} is **[already underway]{.underline}**, and
[low-emission technologies are]{.underline} quickly [becoming more
**widespread**]{.underline}, at least [in]{.underline} China, India, and
[most Western countries]{.underline}. The right policy interventions in
wind, solar, and nuclear power, among other technologies, could soon
make countries' power grids far less dependent on conventional fossil
fuels and radically reduce emissions in the process.

[Technological progress in clean electricity]{.underline} has already
[set off a **virtuous circle**]{.underline}, with [each new innovation
creating more political will to do]{.underline} even [more]{.underline}.
Replicating this symbiosis of technology and politics in other sectors
is essential. In most other high-emission industries, however, deep
decarbonization has been much slower to arrive. In sectors such as
transportation, steel, cement, and plastics, companies will continue to
resist profound change unless they are convinced that decarbonization
represents not only costs and risks for investors but also an
opportunity to increase value and revenue. Only a handful have grasped
the need for action and begun to test zero-emission technologies at the
appropriate scale. Unless governments and businesses come together now
to change that---not simply with bold-sounding international agreements
and marginal tweaks such as mild carbon taxes but also with a
comprehensive industrial policy---there will be little hope of reaching
net-zero emissions before it's too late.

THE FUTURE IS ELECTRIC

From today's vantage point, no single domain offers greater
opportunities for deep decarbonization than electric power. The use of
electricity does not increase or reduce emissions in itself; electricity
delivers energy that may or may not be clean depending on how it was
generated. An electric car, for instance, doesn't do much good against
global warming if all the electricity comes from conventional coal
plants. Still, electrifying the economy---in other words, designing more
processes to run on electricity rather than the direct combustion of
fuels---is essential. This is because, compared with trying to reduce
emissions in millions of places where they might occur, it is far easier
and more efficient to reduce emissions at a modest number of power
plants before distributing the clean electricity by wire. Today, Western
economies convert about 30 percent of their energy into electric power.
If they want to get serious about decarbonization, that fraction will
need to double or more.

Getting there will require progress on two fronts. The first is the
electrification of tasks that use vast amounts of energy but still rely
on fossil fuels, such as transportation and heating. Overall,
transportation accounts for 27 percent of global energy use, and nearly
all of it relies on oil. The car industry has had some success in
changing this: the latest electric vehicles rival high-end conventional
cars in performance and cost, and electric cars now make up around eight
percent of new sales in California (although only 1.3 percent
nationwide) and nearly 56 percent in Norway, where the government offers
massive subsidies to buyers. With improved batteries, heavier-duty
vehicles, including buses and trucks, could soon follow. In fact, China
already fields a fleet of over 420,000 electric buses. By contrast,
aviation---which makes up only two percent of global emissions but is
growing rapidly and creates condensation trails in the sky that double
its warming effect---presents a tougher challenge. A modern battery can
store only two percent of the energy contained in a comparable weight of
jet fuel, meaning that any electric airplane would need to carry an
extremely heavy load in batteries to travel any reasonable distance.
Even in the best-case scenario, commercial electric aviation at
significant scale is likely decades away, at least for long-haul
flights. Long-distance shipping also faces challenges so daunting that
electrification is unlikely to be the best route. And in each of these
areas, electrification is all the more difficult because it requires not
only changing the conveyances but also building new charging
infrastructures.

Besides transportation, the most important electrification frontier is
heating---not just in buildings but as part of industrial production,
too. All told, heating consumes about half the raw energy that people
and firms around the world use. Of that fraction, some 50 percent goes
into industrial processes that require very high temperatures, such as
the production of cement and steel and the refining of oil (including
for plastics). These sectors will continue to rely on on-site fossil
fuel combustion for the foreseeable future, since electricity cannot
match the temperature and flexibility of direct fuel combustion. Yet in
other areas, such as lower-temperature industrial processes and space
heating for buildings, electrification is more practical. Heat pumps are
a case in point: whereas conventional heaters work by heating up indoor
air, heat pumps act like reversible air conditioners, moving heat (or,
if necessary, cold) indoors or outdoors---a far more efficient approach.

Electrification, of course, will not on its own reduce emissions by much
unless the power grid that generates and distributes the electricity
gets cleaner, too. Ironically, some countries have made modest progress
on this front even as they have doubled down on fossil fuels. China, for
instance, has swapped out aging coal plants with newer, more efficient
ones, cutting emission rates in the process. (The country's most
efficient coal plants now emit less carbon dioxide per unit of
electricity than comparable U.S. plants.) The United States, for its
part, has cut down on its emissions thanks to innovations in horizontal
drilling and fracking that have made it economically viable to extract
shale gas. In 2005, when this technology first became commercially
relevant, coal accounted for half of all the electricity produced in the
United States; today, coal's share is down to one-quarter, with much
cleaner and inexpensive natural gas and renewables making up the
difference.

In theory, fossil fuels could still become much cleaner, even nearly
emission free. This could be possible with the help of so-called carbon
capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which capture the carbon dioxide
emissions created by industrial processes and pump it safely
underground. In practice, investors have remained wary of this approach,
but in both the United States and some European countries, recently
introduced subsidies are expected to unleash a wave of new CCS projects
in the years ahead. One CCS scheme, currently being tested by a group of
engineering and energy firms, completely rethinks the design of power
plants, efficiently generating electricity from natural gas while
capturing nearly all the carbon dioxide produced in the process at
little extra cost. In regions where natural gas is cheap and abundant,
this technology could be a game changer.

For now, improved fossil fuel technology has amounted to shallow
decarbonization: it has reduced emissions enough to slow the rate of
climate change---in the United States, emissions from the power sector
have dropped by 29 percent since 2005 thanks mainly to the shale gas
revolution and growth of renewables---but not enough to stop it. To
prevent the world from warming further will require much more focus on
technologies that have essentially zero emissions, such as wind, solar,
hydroelectric, and nuclear power, in addition to CCS, if it proves
commercially scalable. According to the United Nations'
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, these low-carbon technologies
would need to generate 80 percent of the world's electricity by 2050 (up
from about one-third today) in order to limit warming to two degrees
Celsius above preindustrial levels.

Renewables, in particular, will play a central role. Thanks to decreases
in the cost of wind and solar power equipment---and thanks to a mature
hydroelectric power industry---renewable energy already accounts for
over one-quarter of global electricity production. (Nuclear provides
another ten percent.) In the United States, the cost of electricity from
large solar farms has tumbled by 90 percent since 2009, and wind energy
prices have fallen by nearly 70 percent---and both continue to drop.

Given those plunging costs, the main challenge is no longer to make
renewables cheap; it is to integrate them into the power grid without
disruptions. To avoid blackouts, a power grid must align supply and
demand at all times. Energy output from wind and solar plants, however,
varies with the weather, the season, and the daily rise of the sun. The
more a power grid relies on renewables, then, the more often the supply
will not match the demand. In the extreme, extra power must be
dumped---meaning that valuable capital and land were used inefficiently.
To be less vulnerable to such shocks, utility companies will need to
expand the size of their power grids, so that each can draw on a larger
and more diverse array of energy sources. In order to deal with excess
supply from renewables---a condition that will become much more frequent
as the share of renewables rises---they must also create incentives for
users to vary their demand for power more actively and find ways to
store surplus electricity on a much larger scale. Today, nearly all bulk
storage capacity takes the form of hydroelectric pumps, which store
electricity by moving water uphill and recovering about 80 percent of
the power when it flows back down. In the years ahead, soaring demand
for electric vehicles will drive down the cost of lithium-ion batteries;
those batteries could become an affordable way to store energy at the
grid level, too. And as the need for storage increases, even cheaper
methods may come on the market.

To better integrate renewables, policymakers can also rely on the
strategic use of another zero-emission technology: nuclear energy.
Although most efficient when running flat out 24 hours a day, nuclear
power plants can also operate flexibly to cover the supply gaps from
wind and solar power. Some of France's nuclear reactors, for instance,
already cycle from about one-quarter to full power and back again,
sometimes twice a day, to compensate for fluctuations in the supply and
demand of renewables.

Independent of renewables, nuclear power already contributes massively
to cleaner grids. Every year, some 440 operational nuclear reactors
account for lower global carbon dioxide emissions of an estimated 1.2
billion metric tons. In the United States, research suggests that
keeping most existing nuclear plants open would be far less expensive
than many other policy options. In fact, most countries would do well to
expand their nuclear power even further to cut back on their emissions.
In the West, however, major expansions are not on the horizon: public
opposition is strong, and the cost of building new reactors is high, in
part because countries have built too few reactors to benefit from the
savings that come with repetition and standardization. Yet in other
parts of the world---especially China and South Korea, which have more
active nuclear power programs---the costs are much lower and public
opposition is less pronounced. Moreover, whereas countries once designed
and built their own reactors, today many simply import them. That model
can create new risks---the sector's leading exporter today is Russia, a
country not renowned for its diligence regarding reactor safety or the
security of nuclear materials---but it also has the potential to make
commercial nuclear technology available to many countries that could not
develop and deploy it safely on their own. Abu Dhabi's purchase of four
gigantic South Korean--built reactors, the first of which is set to
start operating next year, shows the promise of this model. The same
approach could work for other countries that currently satisfy their
large energy needs with fossil fuels, such as Saudi Arabia.

When it comes to the precise technological makeup of a future
decarbonized economy, expert opinions diverge. Engineers and economists,
for the most part, imagine solutions that bundle several approaches,
with both CCS and nuclear power acting as important complements to
renewables. Political scientists, on the other hand, tend to see a
bigger role for renewables---one of the few areas in energy policy that
usually garners support from across the ideological spectrum, including
in the United States. Yet even this rather popular solution can prove
divisive. Fierce debates rage over where to locate generators such as
wind turbines, including among putative environmentalists who support
the technology only if they don't have to look at it. Public opposition
to new wind turbines in Norway---even in already industrialized
areas---and to offshore wind parks in the eastern United States are
harbingers of tough siting fights to come. The same issue arises when it
comes to power lines: making the most of renewables requires longer,
more numerous power lines that can move renewable power wherever it will
be needed, but public opposition can make such grid expansions a
bureaucratic nightmare. In California, for example, the most recent big
power line designed to move renewable power where it will be useful---in
that case, from the sunny desert to San Diego---took a decade to build,
even though the technical engineering and construction portion of the
project should have consumed no more than two years. China, by contrast,
has blown past the efforts of the United States and Europe, with dozens
of ultrahigh-voltage lines, most of them built in the last decade,
crisscrossing the country.

THE GREAT UNKNOWNS

Political obstacles notwithstanding, expanding the electrification of
transportation and heat and the production of low-carbon electricity
offers the surest path to a clean economy to date. The latest analysis
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for instance, suggests
that more pervasive use of clean electricity in the global economy would
cover more than half the cuts needed for deep decarbonization. Yet just
how big a role electrification will ultimately play is hard to
predict---in part because its impact will depend on the future
trajectory of rival solutions that are only just beginning to emerge and
whose potential is impossible to assess precisely.

Hydrogen, in particular, could serve much the same function as
electricity does now in carrying energy from producers to users---and it
offers crucial advantages. It is easier to store, making it ideal for
power systems dependent on ever-fluctuatingsupplies of renewable energy.
And it can be burned---without producing any new emissions---to generate
the high levels of heat needed in heavy industry, meaning that it could
replace on-site fossil fuel combustion in sectors that are hard to
electrify. Hydrogen (either in its pure form or mixed with other
chemicals) could also serve as liquid fuel to power cars, trucks, ships,
and airplanes. A zero-emission economy could integrate the two
carriers---electricity and hydrogen---using each depending on its
suitability for different sectors.

The technology needed to turn hydrogen into an energy carrier already
exists in principle. One option is to break up (or electrolyze) water
into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen could
then be stored or transported through the natural gas pipeline networks
that already string across all advanced economies. Once it reached its
user, it would be burned for heat or used as an input for a variety of
chemical processes. So far, this approach is too expensive to be viable
on a large scale, but growing investment, especially in Europe, is
poised to drive down the cost rapidly. Initial tests, including planned
networks of hydrogen pipelines outside Stockholm (for making steel),
Port Arthur in Texas (for industrial chemistry), the British city of
Leeds (for residential heat), and the Teesside area (for several
applications, including power generation) and numerous other ventures,
will soon yield more insights into how a real-world hydrogen economy
would fare.

CCS is somewhat of a wildcard, too. Some industrial processes produce
prodigious and highly concentrated streams of carbon dioxide emissions
that should be relatively easy to isolate and capture. The production of
cement, which accounts for a whopping four percent of global carbon
dioxide emissions, is a good example. But firms operating in global
commodity markets, where missteps can be economically disastrous, are
hesitant to invest in fledgling systems such as CCS. To change that,
state-supported real-world testing is overdue. A nascent Norwegian
project to collect carbon dioxide from various industrial sources in
several northern European countries and inject it underground may
provide some answers.

Another promising area for reducing emissions is agriculture, a field in
which advances on the horizon could yield large cuts. More precise
control over the diets of animals raised for food---which will probably
require more industrial farming and less free grazing---could lead cows,
sheep, and other livestock to emit less methane, a warming gas that,
pound for pound, is 34 to 86 times as bad as carbon dioxide. (It would
also help if people ate less meat.) Meanwhile, a host of changes in crop
cultivation---such as altering when rice fields are flooded to
strategically determining which engineered crops should be used---could
also lower emissions.

#### Green tech can't solve climate---it's too late. [And]{.underline} focusing on tech allows more pollution.

Green technology is at the forefront of many climate conversations, from
electric cars, to solar energy batteries, to the burgeoning interest in
carbon capture. Though sometimes well-meaning and useful, green
technology is only one piece of the greater climate solutions pie. [A
**narrow** focus on green technology as a **panacea**]{.underline} for
the climate crisis can [obscure the importance of immediate **political
action** and **social change**.]{.underline}

Before I joined the climate movement, I, like many Americans, saw the
climate crisis as just a scientific problem. This made sense to me
because it was scientists who, through decades of research, linked
carbon emissions to global warming. So, if scientists identified the
problem, then science and technology could get us out. If we had new
energy sources, more efficient cars and could capture carbon, our
problems would be solved, I mistakenly once thought. However, framing
climate problems as a science issue is a strategic misplacement of
responsibility that benefits the corporations that profit from the
perpetuation of the status quo. This framing is a strategy meant
to displace the burden of responsibility for action from fossil fuel
companies, polluting industries and acquiescent politicians, all of
which are to blame for the climate crisis's root causes.

The focus on technology ignores many factors. For one, waiting on a
perfect technology without a swift reduction in emissions and an urgent
transition away from fossil fuels will doom us to the worst of the
climate crisis. Nuclear fusion, for example, will not be ready for mass
utilization by 2050; and neither carbon capture and storage or blue
hydrogen alone will solve the climate crisis. To continue to rely on the
hope of such technologies, while ignoring the immediate gravity of the
climate crisis, is a mistake --- a mistake that many fossil fuel
companies hope we will make and buy them more time. We must be realistic
and not let the promise of exciting new technology get in the way of the
immediate action needed.

The ongoing focus on new technologies also helps keep everyday people
complacent about the climate crisis. When I was under the impression
that we just had to wait for scientists to perfect a miracle invention,
I had no interest in climate action. It allowed me to separate myself
from the problem, and not keep my elected officials and corporate
leaders accountable. However, in the past few years, scientists have
made it abundantly clear that this is not the case. We already have 95
percent of the technology we need. Technologies like renewable
energies are ready for an energy transition away from fossil fuels and
must be coupled with a scaling down of polluting industries and
confronting over-production.

#### Continuing to [invest]{.underline} in green tech [worsens]{.underline} climate change.

Global Warming, but This Just Might\", Newsweek, 10/18/23,

[After the **hottest** Northern Hemisphere **summer on
record**]{.underline}, with record high temperatures around the world,
[Pope Francis]{.underline} recently [exhorted the developed world to
**act faster** on climate change]{.underline}. [An overhaul of wealthy
lifestyles is in order]{.underline}, he said, [and **technological
fixes** are **not the answer.**]{.underline}

As [evidence of climate change]{.underline} itself [becomes **impossible
to d**eny]{.underline}, [governments]{.underline} and industry [are
responding with a new form of **denial**]{.underline}: [the **illusion**
that switching to \"clean\" energy]{.underline} (solar, wind,
geothermal), [\"decarbonizing\" the energy sector]{.underline}, [and
reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 can \"**solve**\" the climate
crisis]{.underline}. [But warming of 2° C or more]{.underline} by 2050
[is **baked in**]{.underline} from the carbon [already in the
atmosphere]{.underline}, [and that doesn\'t **account for**]{.underline}
what current and [**future** emissions]{.underline} will add.

In fact, [the push for clean energy will drive **temperatures
up**]{.underline}, at least in the short term. [Building renewables
requires massive amounts of **fossil fuels** and environmentally harmful
trace **metal mining**]{.underline}. [New transmission infrastructure
**destroys** more **habitat**]{.underline}. And as renewables come
online and fossil fuels phase out, \"aerosol dimming,\" which has been
masking or offsetting warming, will cease. Sulfate aerosols from burning
fossil fuels have a temporary cooling effect. [When fossil fuel use
stops, so will the **cooling effect**]{.underline}. [The Earth
will]{.underline} then [warm faster than lowered CO2 emissions can cool
it]{.underline}, [causing a net **temperature rise**]{.underline}.

What [all this adds up to]{.underline} is [that our chances for avoiding
catastrophic warming depend upon our ability to **remove CO2** already
in the atmosphere, in addition to **stopping the emission** of
more]{.underline}. [The solution proposed by our]{.underline} political
[leaders]{.underline} and amplified in the media [is **more
technology**.]{.underline} Following intensive lobbying by the fossil
fuel industry, the Biden Administration authorized billions of dollars
in new subsidies for the industry to adopt carbon capture and storage
(CCS) technologies.

[Pope Francis rightly noted that such subsidies are a **poor
investment**]{.underline}. A new study compares technologies for
mechanical carbon capture and storage to natural carbon dioxide removal
(CDR) strategies like reforestation, improved forest management, and
encouraging kelp growth in oceans. It found [mechanical methods fall
short by **every measure**]{.underline}, and that restoring forests,
grasslands, and wetlands and shifting to regenerative forms of
agriculture remove more carbon than CCS and use less energy and land.
Through protecting and enhancing natural carbon sinks, natural CDR
strategies are not only cost-effective but have co-benefits like
conserving biodiversity and improving water quality.

[CCS is **expensive**, energy-intensive, and **risky**, and yet
companies that adopt these technologies]{.underline} can [claim
\"**green\" credentials** even though their operations]{.underline} may
**[destroy]{.underline}** some of the [**natural processes** that
sequester carbon **effectively**]{.underline}. And to add a final insult
to this litany of injuries, so far [the most common use for carbon
captured through mechanical means is to pump it
underground]{.underline}---[where it facilitates the extraction of
**more fossil fuels**]{.underline}. And yet [even the IPCC has bought
into this **scam**]{.underline}.

#### Farmers won't [implement]{.underline} sustainable technology -- [structural barriers]{.underline} and [stigma]{.underline}. 

**Leffer 21** (Lauren Leffer, science and environmental journalist,
\"Why aren't more US farmers using sustainable practices?\",
Scienceline, 4/27/21,
https://scienceline.org/2021/04/why-arent-more-us-farmers-using-sustainable-practices/,
ghs-eo)

[From top-down policies that favor a small number of commodity crops to
land access limitations to cultural divides, **numerous barriers**
inhibit progress **toward** a more]{.underline} diverse,
[**sustainable** and **regenerative farming** system]{.underline} in the
U.S. Experts say a multi-faceted approach could close the gap between
the science and the current reality.

"I would say, the majority of farmers I've ever met care very much about
the environment, and they care very much about feeding people. And the
practices that they engage in, for the most part, are mediated by their
access to land, labor, capital and knowledge," says Hannah Wittman, a
rural sociologist at University of British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada. Wittman studies rural communities in North and South America. In
the U.S., she points to federal policies as a big piece of the puzzle
when it comes to how land owners manage their land.

[The]{.underline} U.S. [Farm Bill]{.underline} --- a package of
legislation that covers federal crop insurance, farmer training
programs, food access policy, nutrition assistance programs, and more
--- [**conspicuously** favors **corn and soy**]{.underline}. The bill
directs 75% of U.S. agriculture subsidy money to about 10% of commodity
crop growers who largely grow corn and soy. [Although the Farm Bill
allocates some]{.underline} federal [money for **conservation
practices**]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} spending [accounts for only
**7%**]{.underline} of the total.

Additionally, [the Renewable Fuel Standards program, **touted** as an
**environmentally responsible** policy]{.underline}, [is correlated with
an **increase** in **corn acreage**]{.underline} across the U.S. The
program has mandated that most transportation fuels contain a certain
portion of "renewable" content --- namely, ethanol distilled from corn
--- since 2007, and has played a role in converting diversified
agricultural land, as well as undeveloped and protected areas, into
fields of future ethanol.

Moreover, **[crop insurance]{.underline}**, [which is often]{.underline}
partially [federal-funded]{.underline}, [**compounds** the **financial
pressure** on farmers to stick to **corn and soy**]{.underline}, says
Jennifer O'Connor, author of a Patagonia-sponsored report on barriers to
regenerative agriculture in the U.S. published in October 2020. [Farming
is a **risky business** with fluctuating profit margins.]{.underline}
[So]{.underline}, many [growers rely on **crop insurance** to get
through **tough years**]{.underline}.

"[To **realize** **true**]{.underline} acre [**change** in the
U.S]{.underline}., [we're going to have to see an **entirely different**
crop insurance and subsidy system]{.underline}," says O'Connor,
[referring to changing]{.underline} over acres [from
monoculture]{.underline}, destructively farmed corn and soy
[to]{.underline} more diversified, **[sustainably farmed
crops]{.underline}**. She adds that [in most of the U.S]{.underline}.,
the "heartland," [farmers can only be insured for **soy and
corn**]{.underline}.

Further, [for many U.S. farmers]{.underline}, [the **choice** to grow
something **different** or adopt more **sustainable** practices **isn't
theirs to make**.]{.underline} About [54% of all U.S. cropland is
**rented**]{.underline}, according to a 2014 USDA survey. Absentee
[landowners that purchase land to lease]{.underline} often [do so on a
**short-term** basis]{.underline}, [**hindering** the number of
**long-term** projects that the farmers operating the land can
**undertake**]{.underline}, says Wittman.

Kathryn De Master, an environmental science policy researcher at the
University of California, Berkeley, adds that [landowners often
**dictate** how their land is used]{.underline}. "[The idea that farmers
aren't investing in their land and in more sustainable practices --- it
isn't just because they **don't have access** to the land]{.underline}
over the [long term]{.underline}," De Master says. "[They often **don't
have agency** over what happens to that land]{.underline}."

[While some farmers can't farm sustainably, others **choose not
to**]{.underline}. **[Cultural norms]{.underline}** may
[keep]{.underline} some [U.S. farmers from changing their
ways]{.underline}, says Stefan Gailans of Practical Farmers of Iowa ---
an organization that helps member farmers build more resilient farms.
Gailans says [farming **unconventionally** can]{.underline} sometimes
[bring **stigma**]{.underline}, and in some extreme cases, farmers have
described avoiding places like local coffee shops where their neighbors
might be talking about them. For this reason, he adds, many of the
farmers in his organization's network join because it can be "a tonic or
cure for loneliness," helping farmers find agricultural community
without judgement.

Finally, [there is no **one-size-fits-all** instruction manual for how
farmers]{.underline} across the U.S. [can achieve sustainable
production]{.underline}. "[How we apply regenerative agriculture in
**one region** will be **different** than how we apply it in
**another**]{.underline}," says O'Connor, adding that the context of
each place is critical.

"[We still need to **tune** these \[**regenerative\]
techniques**]{.underline}, and [we still need to make sure]{.underline}
that [whatever suite of techniques is used]{.underline} by a farmer
[works for that particular cropping system in that **particular
region**]{.underline}," says Claire Kremen, a conservation biologist and
agroecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada, and a contributing author to the 2020 Science Advances review
study.

Ecological crisis, climate change and increasing energy usage are
leading to various environmental programs. [Despite]{.underline} the
[proliferation of ecological concerns]{.underline}, high-level
[negotiations surrounding biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}, **[which includes]{.underline}** the resulting
(**[market-based) mitigation practices]{.underline}**, [appear to be
failing at redressing these issues in any meaningful way]{.underline}
(Dunlap and Fairhead 2014; Hunsberger et al. 2017). Capitalist [growth
and the]{.underline} financial [economy remain the highest
priority]{.underline}, which becomes increasingly apparent in the way
extractivism and environmental policy interact[. We are witnessing the
simultaneous **deployment of** industrial- scale **extractivism and
conservation** initiatives that appear to be collaborating and
complementing each other in methods of land control, commodifying
natural resources and extracting value,]{.underline} meanwhile
[suppressing local opposition and resistance.]{.underline} Highlighting
this phenomenon, Büscher and Davidov (2013) reveal the
'ecotourism-extraction nexus' that demonstrates how resource extraction
and eco-tourism are actually co- constructed, share similar logics and
retain multiple forms of collaboration. With this angle, eco-tourism can
become complementary to hydrocarbon and mineral extraction, meanwhile
extractivism can pave the way to eco-tourism demarcation and revenue
extraction (Duffy 2015), leaving communities to negotiate conventional
and green extractive industries (Büscher and Davidov 2013; Sullivan
2013b; Hill et al. 2016). Furthermore, [the discursive fabrication of
'bad' and 'good' extraction remains instrumental, as mining engaged in
environmental programs and 'responsible' mining can become 'sustainable
mining' or support (market- based) environmental
initiatives]{.underline}. **[Mining fabricated as 'sustainable' is based
on CSR and the notion of 'offsetting']{.underline}**. The undeniably
ecologically destructive nature of large-scale mines requires them to
use the logic of offsetting that is constructed in various ways (see
Dunlap and Sullivan 2019). The idea, however, is the same: if you cause
damage in one place you will restore and improve nature in another place
(See Sullivan 2009; Huff and Brock 2017). As mentioned above,
e[nvironmental initiatives are]{.underline} further legitimizing and/ or
[rebranding the images of companies, opening new green economic markets
and undermining environmentalists opposing development
projects]{.underline}. [**Offsetting has tried to brand** Ilmenite
(Seagle 2012), Uranium (Sullivan 2013b) and **lignite coal mining**
(Kirsch 2014; Brock and Dunlap 2018) as 'green' and ecologically
sustainable.]{.underline} Meanwhile, company offsetting sites, aside
from rebranding operations, are then seeking to commodify and make these
'restored' or 'improved' environments legible to the green economy where
biodiversity and carbon storage are then integrated into financial
markets (see Sullivan 2010, 2013a; Fletcher et al. 2018; Dunlap and
Sullivan 2019). Thus, as Seagle (2012) pointed out, [**the more
companies** extract and degrade environments, the more their carbon and
biodiversity investments will increase in value]{.underline}.
**[Offsetting can extend to 'clean' energy projects such as solar and
wind energy development]{.underline}**. While solar and wind energy were
present in the environmental initiatives of the Hambach coal mine (Brock
and Dunlap 2018), we also see [wind and solar]{.underline} projects
[power]{.underline}ing [the infrastructure and public imagine of mining
industries, notable among them is Grupo Mexico]{.underline} (Dunlap
2017a, 2019a). Solar and wind energy projects are themselves paraded as
ecologically sustainable, environmentally friendly and an answer to
climate change mitigation and energy transition. **[There is
little]{.underline}**, however, **[to suggest that industrial-scale
[renewable energy]{.mark} can lead to solving, let alone mitigating
ecological crises.]{.underline}** In fact, **[it [spreads]{.mark}
electrical [infrastructure]{.mark} across the world]{.underline}** (see
Fig. 2 of Chap. 2), **[[energizing]{.mark} mass
[consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}** and life into the Worldeater. [**The
socio-ecological costs of solar and wind energy are**
under-acknowledged, if not **willfully ignored**, to]{.underline}
blindly [expand extractive activities]{.underline} and economic or
(delusional) 'green' growth (see Hickel and Kallis 2019[). It may be
argued that, while so- called renewables (or fossil fuel+) do not
exhaust the resources that they use, the plantation economy
does]{.underline}. We disagree. First, as will be discussed below,
**[[renewables]{.mark} require extractivism]{.underline}** for securing
raw materials [and]{.underline} thereby **[[risk]{.mark} the possibility
of [exhaustion via mining,]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}**[negligent
recycling]{.underline}** protocols, [misleading ecological 'solution'
marketing and capitalist growth imperatives]{.underline}. Second, and
[like most technological interventions, people do not know the long-term
impact that [wind parks]{.mark} have on 'the atmospheric boundary layer
by (a) [reducing wind speeds]{.mark}, (b) generating blade scale
[turbulence]{.mark} in the wake of the turbines, and (c) generating
shear driven turbulence due to the reduced wind speeds in the turbine
wake']{.underline} (Tabassum- Abbasi et al. 2014: 281). Moreover,
**[[absorbing]{.mark} the [sun]{.mark} into [solar
panels]{.mark}]{.underline}**--- the skin of the Worldeater---**[and not
the land [risks unknown]{.mark} site-specific [eco]{.mark}logical
[alterations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Theoretical modeling and now
'concrete evidence', according to Tabassum-Abbasi et al. (2014: 273),
'is emerging that large wind farms can influence local weather but are
also likely to influence the climate and can bring in significant
changes'. [Renewable interventions might be less abrasive than mineral
and hydrocarbon extraction, yet they remain co-constructed and are
producing an infrastructure intervening into wind and solar patterns on
a global-scale to harness and absorb vital energy]{.underline}. This
deserves greater consideration and research to say the least. [Below we
will briefly discuss five criteria---**raw material extraction, land
control, socio-ecological impact, energy use and
decommissioning**]{.underline}---[to assess the viability of solar and
wind energy projects in their respective locations]{.underline}. Where
do those fields of solar panels and large-metal wind towers come from?
[Photovoltaic (PV) **solar and wind** energy projects **require a vast
amount of extraction** and processes. **You will find [fossil
fuels]{.mark} at [every part of]{.mark} the [supply chain]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}in mining, manufacturing, transportation and processing of raw
materials]{.underline}. This also includes the increasing mechanization
of large-scale mining, but consider that according to some sources, 'PV
[solar power systems contain]{.underline} approximately [5.5 tons per MW
of copper]{.underline}, while [grid energy storage installations rely
on]{.underline} between [3 tons and 4 tons per MW']{.underline} (Strong
2016). Meanwhile, according to Wind Power Monthly, 3.6 tons of copper
are used per megawatt in wind energy development (Smith 2014). **[This
includes unknown amounts of various steels]{.underline}** (depending on
the solar project) for panel frames, while [wind [turbines use]{.mark}
roughly 150 metric tons of [steel]{.mark} for reinforced concrete
foundations, 250 metric tons for the rotor hubs and nacelles and 500
metric tons for the tower]{.underline} (Smil 2016). **[The production of
steel, as it stands, is [impossible without]{.mark} burning
metallurgical [coal]{.mark}---or coking coal---which is a [vital]{.mark}
raw material [in]{.mark} the [processing]{.mark} of renewable energy
[infra]{.mark}structure]{.underline}** (Dıez et al. 2002). The
manufacturing of PV requires hazardous materials such as hydrochloric
acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrogen fluoride, 1,1,1-
tricholoroethane, and acetone (UCS 2013; Yang et al. 2017). Thin-film PV
cells also contain toxic material such as gallium arsenide,
copper-indium-gallium- diselenide, cadmium-telluride and coolant liquids
(Yang et al. 2017). **[Wind turbines [also use]{.mark} a variety of
[plastics]{.mark}, minerals and rare earth minerals in their permanent
magnets, such as dysprosium, praseodymium neodymium, and
terbium]{.underline}** (Dunlap 2018e). There are numerous variations 5
between type of wind turbines---geared turbines that do not use
permanent magnets or direct-drive turbines---and solar panels utilizing
different technologies. [The list of minerals and processing necessary
for use are exhaustive, yet **it is important to recognize the extent of
the complex fossil fuel and mineral supply chains, and likely
accompanying human right abuses that lurk behind so-called renewable
technologies**]{.underline} (Finley-Brook and Thomas 2011; Kiezebrink et
al. 2018), which require further research, public acknowledgment and
discussion---to say the least. This collaboration between extractive
industries, extracting minerals for renewable energy or using renewable
energy for extractive operations, has led Dunlap and Brock (2019, Dunlap
2018e) to calling this '[the renewable energy- extraction
nexus]{.underline}'. This nexus, we would add, [aids the Worldeater's
colonizing drive, expanding its grid while remarkably successfully
enrolling people into its entrails as it builds public opinion in
accordance with selective rational interest]{.underline}. Once raw
materials are secured, processed and assembled, or ready for onsite
assembly, the next step is to acquire land with abundant solar and wind
resources. [Solar and wind parks require large tracts of
land]{.underline} (Rignall 2016; Yenneti et al. 2016; Siamanta 2017;
Avila 2018; Dunlap 2017a), [which opens these projects to
the]{.underline} same **[issues associated with land grabbing and
control:]{.underline}** [dispossession carried out by public and private
security forces; land contracts dependent on deception/manipulation;
acquiring contracts through coercion and, overall, multipronged
counterinsurgency style interventions]{.underline} (Dunlap 2018a,
forthcoming). Different forms of 'energy dispossession' (Baka 2017)
offer various and adverse royalties, and socio-economic and ecological
benefits. Land deals, and the methods used to acquire land, will depend
on the companies and the politico-historical context where conventional
and green extractivist projects arrive. The Union of Concerned
Scientists notes that there is 'less opportunity for solar projects to
share land with agricultural uses' than wind turbines, which in theory
is true, yet depends entirely on the company in question (Siamanta and

The innovation and development of clean energy sources such as wind and
solar energy are emerging as a key strategy in the battle against global
warming. The [strategy rests on a seemingly obvious proposition:
innovation lowers the cost of clean energy, leading to substitution away
from fossil fuels, which lowers carbon emissions and mitigates the
problem of global warming.]{.underline} **[The
proposition,]{.underline}** unfortunately, **[is false. Innovation in
[clean energy]{.mark} can [set]{.mark} global [temp]{.mark}eratures on a
[permanently higher]{.mark} path.]{.underline}** [The subsidy of
innovation, as a naked policy instrument unsupported by carbon pricing,
is not merely suboptimal policy]{.underline}. [**[Subsidizing
innovation]{.mark} can make global warming [worse]{.mark}**. To develop
the [economic]{.mark} relationship between clean-energy innovation and
climate change, I start with a [paradox]{.mark} familiar to
environmental economists.]{.underline} [Fossil fuels are an exhaustible
resource.]{.underline} [Suppose]{.underline} that [tomorrow a
[clean]{.mark}, inexhaustible [energy substitute]{.mark} were
universally available at a cost equivalent to 60 dollars per barrel of
oil. The owner of any [conventional]{.mark} fuel deposit with
[low]{.mark} extraction [costs]{.mark} would prefer to sell at 59.99 or
less rather than share the energy market]{.underline} with the
substitute. [[Oil]{.mark} from these deposits will therefore be [sold
before]{.mark} clean energy captures any market share]{.underline} [and
at lower prices as a result of the innovation.]{.underline} [The effect
of the innovation in clean energy is that [fuel]{.mark} will be
[exhausted]{.mark} - and [carbon emitted]{.mark} --- [more intensively
and]{.mark} at an [earlier]{.mark} date.]{.underline} This paradox is
that **[carbon emissions are initially higher as a result of clean
energy innovation]{.underline}**. 1 As set out in the literature,
however, [the theory predicts that in the long run clean energy
innovation helps in the battle against global warming]{.underline}.
Innovation in clean energy has two effects on carbon emissions. First,
as in the example above, [carbon is released earlier into the atmosphere
as a result of innovation]{.underline}. In existing models, this early
release of carbon into the atmosphere is neutral or beneficial in terms
of the long run temperature trend as the atmospheric carbon is
reabsorbed into the earth's surface at a steady rate. The environment,
represented by a single state variable, is able to improve over time.
The second effect of innovation is that fossil fuel deposits with high
extraction cost (above 60 dollars in our example) will be left in the
ground rather than extracted. Less carbon is emitted into the atmosphere
--- a clear benefit of clean-energy innovation. [The net effect is that
the paradox disappears in the long run. The prediction is that
innovation eventually works as intended.]{.underline} 2 [This prediction
is **too optimistic**.]{.underline} The theory offered here represents
carbon in the biosphere via two state variables, carbon in the
atmosphere and carbon on the earth's surface. This allows us to include
a fundamental feature of carbon cycle dynamics: positive feedback
effects. As [greater atmospheric carbon raises the global temperature,
reactive [ice-yields melt]{.mark} and [methane gas]{.mark} is
[released]{.mark} from melting permafrost]{.underline} (to take just two
examples), [resulting in a [higher rate of flow]{.mark} of carbon to the
atmosphere]{.underline}. The effect is that [an initial increase in
carbon emissions that raises global temperature will increase the rate
at which carbon escapes from the earth's surface and accumulates in the
atmosphere**. Innovation combined with the sufficiently [strong feedback
effects]{.mark} then yields higher temperature paths not just in the
short run but [permanent]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}. [The acceleration of
carbon emissions]{.underline} (the first effect of innovation) [may
[overwhelm]{.mark} even in the long run the [benefit]{.mark} of reduced
total carbon emissions]{.underline} (the second effect). [Because of
positive feedbacks, [even]{.mark} a [small innov]{.mark}ation may lead
the temperature path to a discretely higher steady- state
temperature]{.underline}. Global warming is a long run problem and it is
the long run consequences of global warming policies that are critical
for policy[. The theory here argues against clean energy innovation
subsidies as a naked policy instrument.]{.underline} As a component of a
portfolio of policies, however, clean-energy innovation subsidies are of
value because the other main policy instrument, carbon pricing,
eliminates the "dark side" of innovation. To render innovation of value,
carbon prices must be reactive to innovation successes --- and reactive
in a non-obvious way. When a new innovation gives clean energy producers
an advantage over conventional energy, a reactive carbon price policy is
often one that magnifies this advantage, by raising the tax on fossil
fuel use. Fossil fuel producers are hit with a double whammy. Carbon
pricing is thus an important complementary instrument to clean energy
innovation, being necessary even to ensure that the net impact of
innovation is positive. This complementarity is not well understood
among policymakers. With carbon taxes seemingly impossible to implement
given U.S. politics, clean-energy research and development is becoming
the focus across a range of the political spectrum. 3 Support for the
policy trend presupposes that carbon pricing and clean energy subsidies
are substitutes in the battle against global warming. This is natural
assumption, given that these are two instruments available to solve the
same problem, but the assumption is misguided. Carbon pricing is even
more essential when clean energy innovation is successful than when it
is not. This paper contributes to a growing literature on global warming
and an earlier literature on exhaustible resource economics. The clean
energy paradox, or green paradox, in terms of the impact of innovation
described is developed in Strand (2007) and very clearly in Hoel (2008)
as discussed in footnote 1. Acemoglu et al (2011) develop a dynamic
model integrating the economy with climate change in which the driver of
policy design is endogenous technical change. These authors assume a
constant rate of environmental regeneration. This assumption would allow
the environment to recover completely from any past damages if the rate
of emissions could be reduced sufficiently. It is never too late to
recover. [The built-in optimism about the long run in Acemoglu et al
(2011) and in Hoel (2008) disappears once the positive-feedback
mechanisms of the carbon cycle are recognized.]{.underline} [Positive
feedback mechanisms require that the environment be represented by
multiple state variables, as in the climate science literature, not a
single state variable]{.underline} as in Acemoglu et al and Hoel. 4 [I
allow uncertainty in the innovation process]{.underline} in my model [to
capture an important distinction between the ex-ante effect on global
warming of the threat of innovation and the ex post effect of successful
innovation. I]{.underline}n doing so, I draw on the economic literature
on the theory of pricing in an exhaustible resource market subject to
innovation in a backstop technology (Heal 1976, Gallini, Lewis and Ware
1983, Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1981) as well as the literature on
exhaustible resource pricing with heterogeneous extraction costs or
reserve-dependent costs (see Devarajan and Fisher 1981). **[The
[possibility]{.mark} of perverse effects of clean-energy innovation and
the complementarity of innovation and carbon pricing are [not]{.mark}
fully [appreciated in]{.mark} the climate policy
[lit]{.mark}erature.]{.underline}** The most prominent model integrating
economics and climate dynamics is the Dynamic Integrated Model of
Climate and the Economy (the DICE model) (Nordhaus, 2008) and its
extension to a regionally disaggregated model (Nordhaus 2010 and 2011).
The latest version of the DICE model includes a backstop clean-energy
technology, but assumes (1) a current Hotelling rent of \$0.07 per ton
of carbon for fossil fuels (Nordhaus, 2007, p.31), which implies a
Hotelling rent of only \$0.01 per barrel of crude oil; 5 and (2) an
extraction cost of zero (Nordhaus 2008, p.43). The effects analyzed
here, in contrast, rely entirely on a large Hotelling rent. The DICE
assumptions (1) and (2) are at odds with the observed price of 80-100
dollars per barrel. 6 The interaction of innovation and carbon pricing
policy is outside the focus of the DICE model. 7 The Stern review of
global warming policy (Stern, 2006) notes that [the price reaction of
the fossil fuel market may dampen the effects of policy of clean energy
subsidies, but does not recognize the possibility of a negative net
impact of innovation.]{.underline} Stern is solidly of the conventional
view that the net effect of innovation in clean energy must be positive.
Stern surveys the important positive feedback mechanisms in carbon
models but does not connect feedback mechanisms to the reaction of
fossil fuel prices to innovation, which is the analytical focus of this
paper. Section 2 of this paper offers an economic model of innovation
and the dynamics of global warming. Section 3 moves from positive
economic theory to normative analysis, and from the consequences of
existing global warming policy to optimal policy in a first-best world.
I analyze an optimal carbon tax in the model with exogenous innovation.
The first-best optimum can be implemented in a competitive market with a
carbon tax, a tax that will increase in the event of early success in
innovation. Optimal carbon pricing does allow clean-energy innovation to
have an unambiguously positive impact on social welfare. [Even in the
first-best optimum, however, **successful innovation leads to a
worsening of global warming**.]{.underline} The concluding section
offers a critical discussion of the policy literature in light of the
theory developed here.

4\. Discussion

[Of]{.underline} the [over 250 communities]{.underline} setting their
sights [on]{.underline} 100% [renewable energy integration]{.underline},
o[nly 52 of these have met their electrification goals]{.underline}
\[9\]. Notably, the [cities that have met their goals have an average
population of 55 700]{.underline} (ranging from 400 to 390 000
residents), [whereas]{.underline} the [cities that]{.underline} are
committed but [have yet to meet]{.underline} their goals
[have]{.underline} an [average population of 540 000]{.underline}
(ranging from 100 to 1800 000 residents) (figure 1). The cities selected
for this study all have relatively higher populations among cities
committed to 100% renewable energy, and these represent larger urban
areas that have drastically different pathways to success than the
smaller cities working towards the same goals. While [our
study]{.underline} [focused on cities as the focal point]{.underline}
for an energyshed, the energyshed [model can be scaled down to block
groups or up to metropolitan areas]{.underline} as developed in the
initial DeRolph energyshed [assessment]{.underline} as a means to assess
[aggregate energy demand from rural and suburban areas,]{.underline} as
well as city boundaries DeRolph et al \[11\]. Those identified as
\'Powered Cities\' typically are receiving \'100% clean, renewable
electricity\' \[9\] from either a municipal utility provider citing 100%
wind or solar, or from a regional power alliance serving several of
these neighboring communities \[9\]. However, [given the current
limitations of storage]{.underline} and grid infrastructure, our
[data]{.underline} causes us to [question]{.underline} the [authenticity
of]{.underline} a [city as large as]{.underline} 390 000 (Oxnard CA) or
even [90 000 residents (]{.underline}Santa Monica, CA) [being fully
powered by renewable energy 100% of the time]{.underline}.

[Although there is movement in the right direction]{.underline} for the
remaining committed cities, [most of these communities began their
pledges towards 100% renewable energy in the early 2000s]{.underline}
and [thus progress has been slow]{.underline}. With many having
[benchmarks near 2020]{.underline}, and [end goals in 2050,]{.underline}
[none of the 31 cities within this study are even halfway to meeting
their goals]{.underline}, [despite nearing the halfway mark in many of
their timeframes]{.underline}. Although [this subset]{.underline} of 31
cities reflects only 12% of the cities with a commitment, they
[represent 84% of the total population of these 250 cities]{.underline}.
The [EIA projects]{.underline} that [by 2050]{.underline} the country
wide [renewable energy share will be nearly 45%,]{.underline} with the
current renewable generation sitting at nearly 13% of total production
\[7\]. [This implies]{.underline}, assuming energy production remains
constant, that [renewable energy generation will need to triple in the
next 30 years]{.underline} to meet the 45% share. The [EIA expects
carbon emissions to]{.underline} dip slightly through 2035, but then
[continue their climb as energy production continues to outpace the rate
of expected renewable energy transition]{.underline} \[7\]. With this as
the case, and energy demand only increasing, the communities that have
made a pledge to be 100% renewable energy by 2050 have significant
ground to cover given projected trends.

4.1. Moving forward Our results are well aligned with the trends
illustrated in figure 6, as many of the cities exhibit similar trends in
their energy mix progression. As shown in figures 2 and 6, there is
currently a limited amount of planned powerplant construction that would
significantly bolster the efforts towards 100% renewable energy
integration. However, with the new funding and support programs taking
place under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \[16\], it is
still possible for progress to be made in the next few years.
Improvements to electricity grid resilience, reliability, and
flexibility are all essential to the integration of renewable energy
\[17\]. Tools that focus on the improvement to resource and operational
flexibility of the energy sector are critical \[4\]. Given the focus on
improving the energy sectors\' infrastructure, resilience, storage, and
clean energy technology, the Department of Energy has employed the use
of the energyshed framework to help policy makers, engineers,
researchers, and communities more aware of what opportunities, potential
pathways, and barriers are present for local scale initiatives in light
of these large-scale transitions \[13\]. Residential solar, battery
storage, and other distributed energy resources are additional assets
that may continue to shape the energy transitions at more local scales.
One such example is the continued investment and development of rooftop
solar at the residential scale. The analysis herein does not account for
rooftop solar, as it is not included in the national scale powerplant
datasets. Although it is not included in the assessment, rooftop solar
provides an opportunity for homeowners and small businesses to reduce
their electricity bill through energy sales back to the grid or offset
their demand from the grid with rooftop generation/storage. The
limitation here, however, it that large portions of city energy demand
comes from commercial and industrial sectors, where the scale of solar
needed to impact operations would necessitate a powerplant development
that would likely be included in our available datasets. Other efforts
explore and support that there is not only an infrastructural limitation
in energy transitions, but social, economic, and political barriers \[4,
18--24\].

Figure 6. Energy transitions across the United States---the energy mixes
across the United States are shown, separated into renewable and
nonrenewable resources. These totals come from the US Energy Information
Administration \[15, 25\]. 4.2. The need for storage In general, because
the hydropower capacity is expected to remain largely stagnant---while
wind and solar increase---the overall mix of hydropower in the renewable
portfolio often decreases. In each of the cities and across the Unites
States, shown in figure 3, the total energy portfolio shows hydropower
remaining \'constant\' as an overall percentage of the energy supply.
However, in the renewable energy nested chart (figure 3(c)), it is clear
that over time, hydropower will encompass a smaller percentage of
renewable generation. Yet, as it stands, hydropower is our current best
solution to grid scale energy storage for renewable energy, as various
modes of operation can allow for delayed release to meet peak demands or
as baseload dispatch \[26\]. Although hydropower, particularly large
hydropower, is not likely a community level solution, it does contribute
to balancing out the variability of wind and solar power due to grid
scale storage for these technologies. Hydropower has a complex past and
future, but small scale non-powered dam conversions or minimum flow
turbine operations may contribute to more localized renewable energy
efforts \[27--30\]. Where the increase in renewable energy is still
lagging behind the decommissioning of coal powerplants, natural gas
energy generation is often seen to increase (figures 3(b) and
(e))---both in the United States and globally \[31, 32\].

Natural gas was intended to be a \'transition fuel\' to help the energy
sector cut back on emissions by replacing coal powerplants \[31, 32\].
However, there may be indirect effects of using natural gas as a
bridge---in that it has prolonged reliance on fossil fuels and limited
the transitions of the grid and storage infrastructure \[31\]. While
having successfully offered a significant replacement to coal emissions
(figure 6), the growth of natural gas and its label as a \'transition
fuel\' has done little to reframe the mindset of operational, grid scale
renewable energy integration and storage \[27, 33\]. As an example, San
Francisco and Boston show a decrease in renewable energy composition
from 2010 to 2021---primarily from the decommissioning of hydropower
facilities and an increase in natural gas (figure 5). Without redefining
the role of natural gas in the energy sector, large scale efforts for
grid level energy storage will remain one of the most significant
roadblocks to successful renewable energy transitions. 4.3. Competition
or cooperation?

Given current planned construction, it appears that wind and solar
energy are the main paths towards renewable energy integration \[7\]
(figure 7). As such, some communities may begin to compete for land and
powerplant allocation. Without the proper planning and infrastructure
development, these transitions may be met with grid congestion and
instability in distribution. One of the additional insights provided by
an energyshed approach encourages developers to consider what geographic
regions have overlapping interests and generation needs \[10, 11, 13\].
In regard to the mutually exclusive development scenarios---it is also
worth noting the significant infrastructure changes that would be
required to hardwire in powerplants to a single city while passing
through the surrounding regions. Based on the current grid
infrastructure and operations, hardwiring powerplants can be done---but
is unlikely at the scale demonstrated within this study. This suggests
that communities must cooperate and communicate their energy transition
and development plans with one another---as opportunities for optimized
infrastructure development and expansion may be made clear. Figure 7.
Anticipated resource shifts---the transition away from and towards
particular resource types for each city are shown. A positive percent
change implies an increase in that resources\' generation. A negative
percent change implies a decreased reliance on that particular resource
type. The reference period for change is from 2021 energy shed
composition to the planned compositions.

5\. Conclusion

Evident in the magnitude of energy shed overlap from just this subset of
31 US cities, there are many regions across the country that could
foster cooperation for funding, land acquisition, infrastructure
development, distribution networks, and storage efforts for renewable
energy integration. The needs of successful energy transitions require
reframing the issue as not one that is purely technical, economic,
social, or political but that is interdisciplinary and requires
collaboration and communication across multiple sectors. As local
government officials and managers host the conversations for achieving
100% renewable energy within their community, there is a question of who
is engaged as a stakeholder in developing these plans. Much of the
energy sector is driven by supply and demand, operating on its own
unique market structure, which requires the presence of energy
economists \[34\]. Socio-political support for renewable energy
transitions must come from both urban and rural stakeholders where the
various needs and contributions of these groups are explicit and
mutually beneficial \[2, 10, 19\].

There are certainly [many contributing and compounding factors to
explain the lag in transition success despite growing
support]{.underline}. Chief among these seem to remain as (1)
[economics]{.underline}, (2) [leadership]{.underline}, and (3) [energy
literacy]{.underline}. (1) [Although the levelized cost of energy (LCOE)
for renewables has decreased]{.underline}, it has [only done so in more
recent years]{.underline}---however their [intermittency still presents
an issue with meeting peak energy demands due to lack of economic grid
storage options]{.underline}. Within the energy markets themselves,
[facilities that can meet peak energy demands are more
profitable]{.underline}. LCOE does not fully account [for energy market
prices during different periods of the day]{.underline}. It is only now
being recognized as a need to reevaluate the economic assessments of
energy technology and operation to accommodate for renewable
intermittency and storage needs \[35, 36\]. As for (2) leadership, it is
commendable that community leaders are taking up matters and
demonstrating motivation towards energy transitions. However, it is
[still perceived by many that very often there is gridlock, mismanaged
goal setting, and sociopolitical roadblocks at various scales of
government that continue to hinder accountable and actionable
progress]{.underline} \[24, 37, 38\]. One of the other major factors
that underpins majority of the discourse surrounding energy transitions
is the [lack of (3) energy literacy]{.underline}. Our
[world]{.underline} today is [highly \'energy unconscious\' and energy
illiterate]{.underline} despite how intimately energy and energy use are
intertwined with our daily lives and work \[37--39\]. Most of the
general [population would not know where the nearest powerplant to them
is]{.underline}---or how power is delivered to their home.

As research suggests, there are many alternate routes for achieving high
renewable energy penetration pathways---each with their own set of
trade-offs and implied infrastructural changes as the co-evolution of
communities and energy systems takes place \[5, 10\]. Many cities will
sponsor or endorse renewable energy projects outside of their
municipality or city limits. As these projects develop and are
distributed to surrounding areas, there is a traceable measurable
connection to a community aiming towards 100% renewable energy goals. In
contrast, purchasing renewable energy credits outside of a cities
energyshed and labeling it as \'powered by 100% renewable energy\' can
be misleading to the community, and potential detrimental to the
understanding of the infrastructural needs and challenges we face for a
successful energy transition. The energyshed framework may help to
better highlight possible futures for meeting renewable energy
transition timelines, as well as ensuring that additional constraints
and considerations are fully contextualized to the vast energy
landscape.

MANAGING DEMAND

[While companies]{.underline} including Siemens Gamesa and Tesla [are
making a strong case for the added efficiency and performance of
permanent magnets, minor efficiency and performance losses may be an
acceptable tradeoff for avoiding stiff competition over a globally
limited resource]{.underline} (Siemens Gamesa, n.d.; Desai 2018). The
case of rare earth elements suggests that the newest or objectively
"best" technological solution may not always be the most practical or
sustainable solution.

Because environmental externalities are, for the most part, not priced
appropriately, technologies are typically only assessed according to
their production cost and performance. [By thinking ahead to the
resource demands of the energy transition, one can recognize the value
and importance of simple technologies with little dependence on scarce
or difficult to secure resources, even if that sustainability comes with
trade-offs to price or performance.]{.underline}

[One [pathway to demand reduction]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to increase the
efficiency of **[REE use within existing magnet designs]{.mark}**.
Through innovations in material composition and the production
processes, some [manufacturers have been able to synthesize
magnets]{.mark} [with similar strengths to]{.mark} current [REE
magnets]{.mark}, but with much lower concentrations of REEs]{.underline}
(Toyota 2018). Permanent magnets can also be made entirely without REEs,
but these designs typically exhibit additional drawbacks (Widmer 2015).

[Another option is to further develop and encourage the use of motors
and generator technologies that do not utilize permanent
magnets.]{.underline} [Gearbox [wind]{.mark} [turbines]{.mark} featuring
induction generators [use almost no REEs]{.mark}.]{.underline} The main
drawback of this design is the need for mechanical gearboxes to speed up
the relatively slow rotations of the turbine rotor. These gearboxes wear
out over time and require regular maintenance. [[E]{.mark}lectric
[v]{.mark}ehicle motor[s]{.mark} [can]{.mark} also [be made
using]{.mark} induction designs that **require little or [no
REEs]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} albeit with lower efficiencies.]{.underline}

[**Despite these drawbacks**, generators and motors based on
electromagnetic induction have been in use for decades and are still
generally **[cheaper than technologies utilizing
REEs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Widmer 2015). [The current wind capacity in
the U.S. is predominantly supported by induction generators]{.underline}
and most of the earlier Tesla models (Roadster, Model S, and Model X)
run on induction motors. [Further technological developments in these
areas or using hybrid designs that incorporate small amounts of REEs to
increase efficiencies can help **manage the overall demand of
REEs**.]{.underline}

[[What green tech can do]{.underline}]{.mark}

In the field of agriculture[, [vertical farming]{.mark}]{.underline} can
[[revolutionize how vegetables are produced]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Berlin-based Infarm uses [99% [less space]{.mark}, 75% [less
fertilizer]{.mark} and 95% [less water]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}than conventional farming. Protein can also be produced in a
much better way: The Swiss start-up Planted produces plant-based (and
delicious) meat alternatives from kebab to Peking duck with 74% less CO2
emissions. And the implications of plant-based meat go even further:
They could [[free up]{.mark} the [80% of agricultural
land]{.mark}]{.underline} worldwide used for livestock, which currently
only produces 20% of calories.

[[Another innovation]{.mark} probably [less often seen as]{.mark} a
[green tech]{.mark}nology [is 3D printing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its
[[potential becomes clear when looking at Relativity Space]{.mark}, a
[company that can 3D print entire rockets]{.mark} as well as their
engines [using a hundred times fewer parts]{.mark} than a typical
rocket.]{.underline} This translates to [fewer parts that need to be
shipped to production sites for final assembly, and the potential to
ultimately move from a centralized to a decentralized production
infrastructure that can reduce both the CO2 emitted in factories as well
as in supply chains.]{.underline}

In addition, [[green tech changes the way energy can be produced and
stored]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the most innovative companies in the
field are Energy Vault, which uses gravitational energy to efficiently
store renewable power, and Heliogen, which produces green hydrogen
entirely from solar power. [While vertical farming is radically
different from 3D printing and energy storage, there is one thing that
all these solutions have in common**: They [reconcile
tech]{.mark}nological [advances with the production limits]{.mark} of
our planet and enable sustainable progress. Green tech could thus be a
major solution for increasing living standards around the world and a
significant contributor to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals.**]{.underline}

[[Escalation of Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} In some cases, supply
chain disruptions can have an even more-direct impact than general
disruption, causing [[shortages of commodities]{.underline}]{.mark} the
nation must have to ensure national security. This kind of disruption
can [go beyond matters of justice, equity, and general prosperity to
[threaten]{.mark}ing a [nation\'s]{.mark} very [ability to defend
itself]{.mark} and look after its citizens]{.underline}. Some examples
are pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment, energy, food, raw
materials used in manufacturing, and semiconductors used in multiple
different systems including military applications. Such shortages can
make the [[need for a national government to act]{.mark} more dire and
immediate [and]{.mark} thus [raise the risk of
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In some cases, particular types
of raw materials only exist in certain places, so shifting to
more-secure sources isn\'t even possible.

[Supply chain [disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline} create [both [leverage
for some nations]{.mark} and reasons for other nations to minimize
leverage]{.underline}. For example, [[Taiwan currently dominates the
market for semiconductors]{.mark}, which in some respects [gives it
leverage with other actors, including the]{.mark} mainland People\'s
Republic of China ([PRC]{.mark})]{.underline}. Semiconductors are
capital-intensive---a new fabrication facility for semiconductors costs
approximately \$4 billion, with some estimates as high as \$12 billion,
and can take three or more years to build. This does not even account
for the skilled labor, and points to the difficulty of readily shifting
production. [[As a result, Taiwan gains considerable leverage over
the]{.mark} PRC and indeed the [world.]{.mark} However, this [very
dominance]{.mark}, plus its proximity to the PRC and its dependence on
the PRC for other commodities, may in fact [raise the incentive for the
PRC to take aggressive military action to ensure access to a key
commodity]{.mark}. [Such action could range from]{.mark} a "quarantine"
to [military threats to an actual invasion]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Aggressive action may stop well short of outright war, yet still be very
dangerous for actors in the system. The problem of security
vulnerability overall is complicated by the complexity and spread of
supply chains across the world. A nation might not be able to
successfully secure a commodity just by aggressive action against a
single other nation. However, that action against another nation
certainly could have the unintended effect of causing supply chains to
fail in a more general manner. Aggressiveness, while understandable and
probably predictable, might therefore also be extremely dangerous and
unproductive.

Conflict and Instability [[Nations have gone to war in the past over
natural resource shortages]{.mark} or in an effort to secure key markets
and labor pools. The need to secure resources and markets was an
explicit premise in German and Japanese actions leading to World War
II.]{.underline} Such [[conflict has occurred even during times of
significant interdependence]{.mark} between nations]{.underline}, such
as in the European system prior to World War I. Historically, nations
have not yet resorted to war to ensure supply chain security, but it
might be a mistake to assume that such action could never occur when
circumstances become sufficiently dire. Interdependence does create
incentives to cooperate to avoid disruption, but may offer few
alternatives for some desperate nations if some part of the
interdependent chain is broken. Meeting the Challenge [Supply chain
interdependence is a fact of life]{.underline}. It is very unlikely to
change in the next decade. However, with [[interdependence comes
risk]{.mark},]{.underline} and in the case of supply chains, often risks
that are not fully appreciated. In addition to the risks generated by
competition in the international system, there are also external
shocks---such as natural disasters---which could rapidly make the
systemic challenges unendurable, which might then become a national
security issue in the most extreme sense. A key point is that **[[market
mechanisms may not in themselves eliminate the incentive to
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These supply chain disruptions often
come from markets failing in some way---perhaps because of some large
collective event such as a disaster or pandemic---and thus the resulting
problems require a collective action to truly solve them.

Food security in developing countries is further complicated by social
equality and political stability. [People lacking food security will
search for a better life elsewhere. [Food insecurity]{.mark} and hunger
have [led to]{.mark} the [displacement]{.mark} of millions, [and
migration]{.mark} brought about by food [insecurity]{.mark} has
[destabilized several countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Complicating the
situation even more, even when people may have enough to eat, they still
may be unhealthy due to poor diets that lead to obesity, diabetes, heart
disease and other malign conditions. [[Tech]{.mark}nology can help
[provide]{.mark} basic and extra [food]{.mark} choices [to]{.mark}

[[Humans have **fought over food**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the means
of producing it [for **20,000 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as rock art
in Australia shows]{.underline}. [[Food]{.underline}]{.mark}, water
[[and land scarcity]{.underline} [are **primary drivers**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} two thirds of [[modern
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} today. Indeed, [many people seem to have
forgotten that the primary German war aim in **World War II** was to
take **farmland** from the Soviets and put German farmers on
it.]{.underline} It is very likely that [controlling the Ukraine's
bountiful and reliable food bowl is among **Putin's** main
aims]{.underline} also. In the short run this is imposing hunger and
even starvation on hundreds of millions of people far beyond Europe. 

**[Spreading [hunger]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in turn [**snowballs** into
**government failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[civil
wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[refugee
tsunamis]{.underline}**]{.mark} [around the world]{.underline} -- as it
did in 2008 when a shortfall in Ukrainian grain exports led to
revolutions in three Arab countries. Already, a third of a billion
people -- equal to the entire population of Europe -- leave their homes
each year, either as refugees or economic migrants, to seek better lives
in countries which seem more stable and food secure. War will add to the
flood.

Thus, in developing a new food system for the world of the 21st Century,
we also have to find a way to curb the human appetite for war.

In [Food or
War](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/earth-and-environmental-science/environmental-policy-economics-and-law/food-or-war?format=PB),
I trace the links between food and conflict through human history,
explore the role of food in recent conflicts and examine [nine [regions

[**[conflict]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [foreseeable
[future]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [conflicts [ranging from riots]{.mark}
and government failure [to **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. My aim
is to show that [the [link between food and war]{.mark} is
**[inexorable]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- but that it can be broken. And
that [[having enough]{.mark} good [food]{.mark} is the most under-rated,
under-recognised and [precious 'weapon of peace']{.mark} in the world
today]{.underline}.

[The global [food security crisis]{.mark} is [due to]{.mark} the
**[imbalance in food production]{.mark}** and the increasing number of
people drowning in hunger. ]{.underline}

As [[population]{.mark} and income **keep [rising due to
inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the number of middle-class people is
also hitting unprecedented growth, [[affecting]{.mark} the **[demand for
food]{.mark}** and other natural resources. ]{.underline}

It leaves the vulnerable groups, including the rural and urban poor,
with an inadequate and inaccessible amount of safe and nutritious food
that can help maintain a healthy lifestyle.

[While current programs, interventions, and campaigns are placed to
discuss global food security, it has always been the execution that
stops that green button from being tapped and implemented. ]{.underline}

Proactive interventions such as policy-making, conferences, and summits
are becoming more inclusive due to the participation of many people
worldwide despite their backgrounds, nationalities, and age. The
discussion should not be the period that will end the exploration of
solutions.

[[Food security]{.mark} should be [on]{.mark} the **[urgent-priority
agenda]{.mark}** of all countries]{.underline}, but it is a wicked
problem; other factors are affecting the success of food security and
sustainability in every country. 

The lack of education is one of the most significant factors affecting
this topic. When people do not understand the concept of food security
and have the critical thinking to participate and involve themselves in
creating a more sustainable food solution, we hit a dead end. 

The government is also an important factor here since their lack of
transparency and good governance leads to failed policies, planning, and
execution of projects catered to improving food security. These factors
should be addressed separately but assessed together to see the bigger
picture. 

Call for Green Technology

Many would ask, how can [[green tech]{.mark}nology [improve food
security]{.mark}]{.underline}? 

From the term itself, green technology uses "green" or Science to
mitigate the adverse environmental effects of our activities and protect
what is left of our world's natural resources. 

We cannot deny that all the environmental issues around us are true and
hampering our way daily. But we can still do something, so we should do
something.

Improving Food Security through Green Technology

It was identified that [the food gap has been widening over the past
years, and we must increase food production]{.underline} using Science
and Technology. 

But how can [[technology]{.mark} improve food security? [Improve
genetics, reduce food]{.mark} waste and [loss]{.mark}, i[mpro]{.mark}ve
soil [fertility]{.mark}, and [restore degraded
land]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Laboratory Plants

Science, technology, and innovation remarkably [produce more food by
[artificially creat]{.mark}ing plant varieties [to **improve plant
traits**]{.mark}. It also maximizes the inputs to [make
ag]{.mark}riculture more **[effective and
efficient]{.mark}**. ]{.underline}

Suppose we have a vast variety of plants available to the people,
especially the marginalized ones, to meet the demand. In that case, we
can find the demand and supply equilibrium.

Genetic Modification

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

Second, [[genetic modification]{.mark} of organic plant varieties due to
today's technology can be used for [**fortifying nutrients**, developing
**drought-**]{.mark}**tolerant mechanisms**, and [herbicides, diseases,
or pests resistance]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need cross-breeding to
improve plant varieties and characteristics. 

[Some [plants]{.mark} can only survive in one particular season and
environment. Still, if they can be genetically modified using
technology, they will be able to [become **more
productive**]{.mark}]{.underline} even in the harshest of environmental
conditions. 

[[Farmers]{.mark}, especially in far-flung places, will [have]{.mark}
more [power]{.mark} over their work and crops [through **biotechnology
and** ]{.mark}**new [seed tech]{.mark}nologies.**]{.underline}

Transgenic Modification

Third, in connection with genetic modification, we also have [transgenic
adaptation wherein genetic parts of a specific unrelated organism will
be inserted into another -- both should be **unable to cross-breed**
through natural means. ]{.underline}

What is excellent about [[transgenic modification]{.mark} is that it
[allows for **improved nutrition**]{.mark}**, appearance, and taste,
[tolerance to stresses]{.mark}** brought on by external factors like
insects, droughts, diseases, and reduced amount of synthetic fertilizers
used to grow the plant.]{.underline}

[We need to increase plant productivity in a given area unit because [we
are already]{.mark} in the middle of [losing our soil]{.mark} and water.
There is an existing increase in water scarcity and land degradation
that we cannot and should not ignore. ]{.underline}

There are many laboratory-made plants now that were brought to life by
transgenic modification like Banana Xanthomonas wilt. Bt-cotton,
Bt-Maize, New Rice for Africa (NERA) rice varieties, and Maruca Vitara.

Soil Management

Fourth, [**[managing soil]{.mark} to [increase]{.mark} agricultural
[yields]{.mark}**[. Tech]{.mark}nology is [very apparent]{.mark} at this
point since plenty of innovative technologies emerged in the market as
soon as the need to manage our soil was found to be a [crucial step
toward]{.mark} global [food security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

All of the mentioned points above, especially the genetic ones, will not
increase in numbers if soil fertility suffers. 

Fertile soils have been one of the key factors in sustaining our
agricultural productivity in different countries and creating food
security. But what happens when our soils become toxic? 

They kill our plants and, therefore, our food. The current technological
advancements are mostly centered on fighting diseases and pests and
increasing the number of crops, completely ignoring sustainable soil
management practices.

It should always start from where the roots are since healthy soil
yields healthy plants. 

The use of synthetic fertilizers made us more dependent on these to
produce our crops, but they reek of nitrogen which is known for its
negative effects on the environment. 

Through technology and science, we now have dependable biological
fertilizers that are more affordable and effective.

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

Finishing with the question of how can green technology improve food
security, we can see how essential the role of green technology is for
the betterment of our society.

It is safe to say that green technology has been helping us shape a
better future for our families and the generations. Food security can be
achieved if we know how to maximize what we know and turn them into
applications in real life. 

[[Suppose we]{.mark} always [depend on]{.mark} the [current
tech]{.mark}nology damaging the environment because of its irrelevance
in our society. In that case, [we will **never achieve** ]{.mark}**the
[food security]{.mark}** we are always dreaming about.]{.underline}

#### Sustainable tech is key to solve food insecurity and pollution.

[[Sustainable production]{.mark} is considered as [an important approach
to solve]{.mark} the **dilemma [of food insecurity.]{.mark}** [Green
tech]{.mark}nologies have made contributions to [improv]{.mark}ing food
[production and reduc]{.mark}ing environmental [pollution]{.mark}.
Studying the effects of green technologies on sustainable food
production has great significance.]{.underline} The paper started with
the influence mechanism of green technology application on the green
total factor productivity of grain (GTFPG). With the GTFPG, green
technology efficiency change of grain (GECG) and green technical
progress change of grain (GTCG) measured, threshold models were
constructed to explore the nonlinear impacts of various green
technologies on GTFPG and the influence paths. Results indicated that
the differences of GTFPG among provinces in China were decreased mainly
due to the changes of GTCG, while the regional differences of GECG
remained small. The impacts of green technologies had threshold effects
that depended on the ecological effects of green technologies in
different application stages, and were significantly different in the
major and non-major grain producing areas. Meanwhile, significant
differences existed in the influence paths of green technologies.
[[In]{.mark} the [major grain]{.mark} producing [areas, green
tech]{.mark}nologies were more likely to [improve
GTFPG]{.mark}]{.underline} through the GTCG path; while in the
[[non-major]{.mark} grain producing [areas]{.mark}, the [GECG]{.mark}
path [and]{.mark} the [GTCG]{.mark} path were [both important]{.mark} to
improve GTFPG]{.underline}. The differences of green technologies'
threshold effects and influence paths in the major and non-major grain
producing areas were caused by regional technology preference, resource
endowment and technology compatibility. This study emphasizes that the
development of green technologies should fully consider the resource
endowment and economic development of different regions, as well as the
applicability and adoption rate of green technologies.

### AO\-\--Democracy\-\--2AC

#### A transition to [green tech]{.underline} ensures [sustainable]{.underline} democracies\-\--stops autocratism and econ [collapse]{.underline}.

green transition is key to safeguarding democracy,\" World Economic
Forum,

accessed 7/1/24, S.A.M.\]

[Two global crises have come to a head]{.underline} -- [climate change
and the [decline of democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. If global warming is
to be kept below 1.5 ^o^C, the world must act now to reduce carbon
emissions. Achieving this objective requires substantially lowering
fossil fuel use through a clean energy transition. [For the [past 15
years, democracy has been in decline worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
[protect and promote freedom, [leading democracies must strengthen their
economies and safeguard liberty]{.mark}.]{.underline} These [two aims
are]{.underline} not mutually exclusive but [complementary]{.underline}.
[[Reducing reliance on fossil fuels]{.mark} and transitioning to
low-carbon alternatives also [make democratic economies more
sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Major democracies should work together
to achieve these two goals.

**[[Democracy and green energy transition are
linked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Evidence for 83 advanced, emerging
market and developing countries]{.mark} indicates that in recent years
[democracies have been more willing to adopt green recovery
policies]{.mark}, lessen fossil fuel dependency and reduce the
underpricing of these fuels]{.underline} (see table). Those
[**[countries that have made steps to green their
economies]{.underline}** i]{.mark}n recent years **[are [largely free
and democratic, whereas those who have not are typically less free and
more autocratic.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

But it is among the world's richest and largest economies -- the Group
of 20 (G20) -- where the association between freedom and greenness is
most striking (see figure). [G20 countries with greater political rights
and civil liberties tend also to have greener policies and
economies.]{.underline} In comparison, countries that are less free are
"browner". This relationship between democracy and greenness matters, as
what happens in G20 economies has important implications for the future
of the world economy, including curtailing climate change and other
global environmental risks. A [clean energy transition led by major
economies is essential for]{.underline} attaining [net-zero]{.underline}
carbon emissions by 2050, and [[any delay in progress over the coming
years]{.mark} could make this target unattainable]{.underline}. In
addition, [sacrificing further progress toward a low-carbon economy
could [put democracies in greater economic peril]{.mark}]{.underline},
not less. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought renewed focus on this
economic weakness.

#### Global totalitarianism risks extinction

[[A world dominated by totalitarian states would be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more incompetent, [[more war-prone]{.mark}, less
cooperative]{.underline}, and more inhibitive of progress [[than]{.mark}
one dominated by [democratic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our current
world is not particularly competent, peaceful, cooperative, or
progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world would be worse. [[It would
increase the risk of]{.mark} another [collapse and
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} and could shape the future toward less
desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are incompetent. They are bad at forecasting and
dealing with disasters]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen
most clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in
which millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikötter, 2010;
Snyder, 2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely,
if ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then a world dominated by them would likely be worse at responding to
risks of collapse and extinction.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is more likely to have major
wars. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely (if ever) go to
war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so [[a world dominated by
democracies has fewer wars]{.underline}.
[Miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}[ulation [might be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark} particular [[problem for totalitarian states due to
personalization and disincentives for accurate
info]{.mark}rmation,]{.underline} leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely, by]{.mark} raising the chance of [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction [being used]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are less cooperative]{.mark} than
democratic states]{.underline}. While cooperation is possible (Ginsburg,
2020), [their [internal norms are characterized by
paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} and treachery, and their lack of
transparency limits their ability to credibly commit to agreements.
[[This is bad for]{.mark} all [risks that require cooperation such
as]{.mark} [pandemics or climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued social and [scientific progress is likely to reduce
risks of]{.mark}]{.underline} collapse and
[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}. Social progress could reduce global
inequality and other risk factors. [[Scientific progress could help
address natural risks and climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sandberg,
2018), differentially increase defensive rather than offensive power
(Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019), [[and solve safety challenges in AI or
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology (Russell, 2019).
[[However,]{.underline}]{.mark} as we will now discuss [[totalitarian
states would likely inhibit social progress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, [democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy]{.underline}. Second, they have within
themselves the mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50)
years, the lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and
non-white people have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has
expanded, and could continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the
moral universe is long, but given the right conditions, it might just
bend toward justice (King, 1968). A global society dominated by these
values, and with the possibility of improving more, has a better
longterm potential. [A totalitarian-dominated world,]{.underline} on the
other hand, [would reduce the space for resistance and
progress---distorting the human trajectory.]{.underline}

[We should be particularly concerned about "bottlenecks" at which values
are particularly important---where there is a risk of
"locking-in]{.underline}" [some]{.underline} particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) [values]{.underline}. While they are currently faroff,
[future technologies such as artificial general intelligence, space
settlement, life extension (of autocrats), or much better surveillance
could enable lock-in]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify emergency powers and secure elites, and with shifting alliances
of convenience as states bandwagon and balance, thereby preventing any
resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order could be rather robust,
perhaps for decades or even centuries.

[[A]{.mark} long-lasting [totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world
would]{.mark} extend the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened risk of collapse or extinction, as well as increased
potential for distortion of the human trajectory and the possibility
that a "[lock-in"]{.mark} event may occur]{.underline}. This example
illustrates the possibility of a "negative recovery," [[resulting in a
trajectory]{.underline} [with less or no scientific and social
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} [and a less favorable geopolitical
situation, [which would threaten the destruction of humanity]{.mark}'s
longterm potential]{.underline}.

[The US does not have enough icebreaker ships to compete in the Arctic
the way Russia can]{.underline} with its much larger fleet, a US
military commander warned.

US Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot, the commander of US Northern
Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said on Thursday
that the [US currently has really **only one** heavy icebreaker ship
for Arctic operations while **Russia has approximately 40**
available.]{.underline}

\"We do appreciate that the Coast Guard is procuring more icebreakers,
but even with those, [we will be severely outnumbered]{.underline},\"
Gen. Guillot said during a US Committee on Armed Services hearing.
\"[That does **limit our freedom of maneuver** in that
region.\"]{.underline}

Icebreaker ships are special-purpose vessels designed with a stronger
hull, a very specific shape, and greater power to effectively break
through thick ice blocking access to strategic waterways and clear paths
for other ships**.**

The one available heavy US icebreaker is the USCGC Polar Star, and then
there is the medium icebreaker Healy. Another vessel has been out of
action for years.

Maine Sen. Angus King expressed concerns during the hearing Thursday
about the icebreaker \"gap\" or deficit and urged that the US military
not wait to build up defenses in the Arctic as Russia increases its own
military presence in the region.

To the senator, [not having sufficient icebreakers is unproductive, like
\"not having a road to get where you need to get.\"]{.underline}

Russia has [deployed nuclear-powered icebreakers called Arktika and
Sibir, which have been characterized as the largest and strongest
icebreaker ships in the world.]{.underline}

This isn\'t the first time alarms have sounded over the lack of
icebreakers. Last fall, the US had a noticeable icebreaker gap, and
lawmakers determined that investing in the Coast Guard is crucial for
maintaining momentum in the Arctic.

\"We need to make sure that we are trying to close a very very
significant icebreaker gap, Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said at the time.
[\"Even China\'s icebreaker capacity is on pace to surpass ours in
2025,\" he said, \"and they are not even an Arctic
nation.\"]{.underline}

For more than 20 years, the Coast Guard has been asking for funds for
the Arctic, but those requests have been deferred, US Coast Guard Vice
Admiral Peter W. Gautier said last year. Now, conversations around
Arctic militarization are being discussed amid proposals for the 2025
fiscal year budget.

In addition to Russia becoming more active, [China has also shared
Arctic aspirations.]{.underline}

You don\'t often hear people talk up the benefits of global warming [but
there appears to be at least one upside \-- commercial ships traveling
the Arctic waters above Russia can now make the voyage **sans
icebreakers**.]{.underline}

According to Reuters:

Two German ships set off on Friday on the first journey across Russia\'s
Arctic-facing northern shore without the help of icebreakers after
climate change helped opened the passage, the company said.

Niels Stolberg, president and CEO of Beluga Shipping GmbH, said the
\"Beluga Fraternity\" and \"Beluga Foresight\" left the Russian port of
Vladivostok on the historic and cost-saving journey with cargo picked up
in South Korea bound for Holland.

[The melting of Arctic ice as a result of climate change has **made it
possible** to send Beluga\'s **multi-purpose heavy lift ships** along
the legendary Northeast Passage, Stolberg said.]{.underline}

Beluga got Russian authorities\' clearance to send the first non-Russian
commercial vessels through the route on Friday.

The Northern Sea Route trims 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 km) off the
usual 11,000-mile journey via the Suez Canal \-- [yielding considerable
savings in fuel costs and CO2 emissions, he said.]{.underline}

[So global warming, which CO2 contributes to, leads to fewer CO2s being
emitted, at least in this one example.]{.underline} Strange but true.

As [climate change causes Arctic sea-ice to retreat at an accelerated

The [Northwest Passage (NWP) is a shipping route that connects the
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and makes shipping shorter and cheaper for
companies]{.underline} travelling from Asia to North America. In 2013,
the bulk carrier Nordic Orion traversed the Northwest Passage with an
icebreaker escort that shortened their journey by four days and saved
an [estimated \$200,000
USD](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/northern-exposure-can-the-northwest-passage-live-up-to-its-billing-as-a-maritime-superhighway).
The proposed route from East to West would begin in the Davis Strait and
travel north through Baffin Bay into the Canadian Archipelago. After
crossing through the Canadian Archipelago, the route would continue into
the Beaufort Sea and exit through the Chukchi Sea into the Bering
Strait. [Currently the route is not possible to complete without an
icebreaker escort, but **due to climate change, it may soon become
possible** with the Arctic being ice free in the summer
months]{.underline}. With this opportunity for monetary savings, the
Northwest Passage may very quickly become a popular shipping route that
may have a dramatic impact on the ecosystems it passes through.

Challenges in Expanding the U.S. Icebreaker Fleet

[The journey to bolster the U.S. icebreaker fleet is fraught with
challenges]{.underline}. The construction of new icebreakers, such as
the planned Polar Security Cutters, has faced budget overruns and
delays. Initially estimated at \$5.1 billion, the program is running 60%
over budget, with the lead ship, Polar Sentinel, expected years behind
schedule. [This situation mirrors the broader crisis in U.S.
shipbuilding capacity, where expertise has dwindled over the
decades.]{.underline}

It\'s true that ice is melting in the Arctic, but this doesn\'t mean the
U.S. no longer needs icebreaker ships to operate in the region. And
right now, the U.S. needs more than what it currently has. 

The Navy doesn\'t operate icebreakers, but the Coast Guard does.
According to its website[, the Coast Guard currently has only two
operational icebreakers in its fleet. ]{.underline}

\"Strategically, [icebreakers provide persistent presence in a way

## Pacific Herring

### 1NC -- Warming Good \[Herring -- BioD\]

#### Herring population is declining now

[Herring Decline]{.underline}

Under the guidance of the DFO, [Pacific [herring numbers have
decreased]{.mark} up to [96%]{.mark} in some areas [in the last fifty
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are several reasons for this decline,
but researchers have identified [[commercial overfishing and]{.mark} DFO
[mismanagement]{.mark} as the [main culprits]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
most detrimental type of commercial fishing for herring is the sac roe
herring kill fishery, as the entire fish is harvested just for the roe.
The remaining 90% of the catch biomass, including the entire male, is
processed into dog food, fertilizer, and feed for farmed salmon. Many
consider this fishery to be wasteful. As already mentioned, the kill
fishery removes reproductive females from herring populations.

[[The DFO]{.mark} has [consistently]{.mark} [overestimate]{.mark}d
[herring populations, resulting in overfishing]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These overestimations are influenced by several factors, including
industry pressure and even ignoring the findings of its own scientists.

One flaw in the DFO approach to herring stock management is that it
lacks essential spatial considerations. First Nations have always
understood that herring form distinct sub-stocks, each connected to
specific spawning areas, resulting in First Nations herring management
taking place at the level of individual spawning sites. Because the DFO
has used a much larger regional spatial approach and has relied on a
maximum sustainable yield single-species approach to fisheries
management, four of the five Pacific herring fishing grounds collapsed
following the 2015 opening. The 2022 opening of the Strait of Georgia
herring fishery was disastrous and illustrates that the DFO once again
overestimated herring populations and size while ignoring First Nations
on the coast, such as the Heiltsuk, who have consistently advocated for
sustainable herring fisheries. However, [the [DFO]{.mark} has
[constantly]{.mark} gone [against]{.mark} the [science and management
agreements]{.mark} with First Nations]{.underline}. According to
McKechnie et al., the most likely "explanation for the difference
between the modern pattern of variability in herring abundance and the
long-term archaeological record is the onset of industrial-scale
commercial fishing."

The disastrous 2022 herring fishery has had some impact on herring
fisheries management, as both the Haida Gwaii and West Vancouver Island
herring fisheries are closed for the 2024 season. However, the Strait of
Georgia will be open for Roe (and Food and Bait, Special Use) fisheries
at a 10% harvest rate to a maximum of 8,058 tons. Seine boats have been
allocated 1,861 tons, and gillnets may harvest 3,159 tons. Many
commentators see the opening of the Strait of Georgia herring sac roe
kill fishery as problematic due to the historic overfishing of this
specific population. In the draft integrated fisheries management plan,
DFO presented several harvest possibilities. However, in the end, DFO
selected the scenario allowing for increased harvest, boosting the quota
in tonnage by 1,433 from 2022/2023. The Prince Rupert district is also
open for the sac roe kill fishery in 2024 with a 5% harvest rate to a
maximum of 2,271 tons. Seine boats have been allocated 369 tons, and
gillnets may harvest 302 tons. [[The total allowable catch]{.mark} for
this district has [increased]{.mark} this year [by 485
tons]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Herring is a [keystone]{.underline} species and loss causes biodiversity collapse -- black bears, wolves, sea lions, seals, humpback whales, gray whales, orcas, and birds.

[The Pacific [herring]{.mark} may be the **[single most important
species on our coast]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Herring are small forage
fish up to thirty centimetres long and 500 grams in weight. The Pacific
herring is silver, with unspined fins and a deep caudal fin.

The life cycle of herring is unique and includes spawning, feeding,
migration, and maturation stages. A critical aspect of the herring life
cycle is that once females reach maturity around 3 to 4, they can spawn
up to 9 times in their lifetime, with the average female spawning six
times. This, of course, [depends on whether or not they survive,
including surviving the herring sac roe kill fishery.]{.underline}

Many consider the Pacific herring to be the single most important
species in our coastal waters because herring convert plankton to energy
that powers our entire coastal ecosystem.

Understanding the Herring Spawn

Herring gather in large schools in shallow waters or estuaries during
their spawning period, with a single spawning event stretching over many
kilometres of shoreline. [[18% of]{.mark} British Columbia's
[coast]{.mark} has been [classified as herring spawning
habitat]{.mark}]{.underline}. One interesting fact about Pacific herring
is that they exhibit strong spawning site fidelity, meaning they
typically return to the same spawning grounds yearly. This behaviour is
a common trait among many fish species and is crucial for the survival
and maintenance of distinct herring populations. Site fidelity in
spawning helps ensure that herring spawn in locations with environmental
conditions suitable for the survival of their eggs and larvae. Research
has found that the homing behaviour Pacific herring exhibit is driven by
a combination of environmental cues, such as water temperature,
salinity, and possibly even magnetic fields, as well as learned social
behaviours.

Females lay their sticky eggs on seaweed, sea grass, or rocks, which are
then fertilized by the milt (sperm) male herring release into the water.
The milt turns the water in the spawning ground into a distinctive
chalky white, as seen in the images. The eggs' adhesion is vital for
protecting them from being washed away or eaten by predators, although
many are consumed by various species. The eggs incubate for about 10
days to a few weeks, depending on the water temperature. During this
time, they develop into larvae while still attached to the substrate.

A single mature female herring can spawn 20,000 eggs annually, with the
average female herring spawning between 6 to 8 times in her lifetime.
This means a female herring has the potential to spawn close to 200,000
eggs in her lifetime. One of the many criticisms of the herring sac roe
kill fishery is that it removes reproductive females from herring
populations.

After hatching, juvenile herring feed mainly on zooplankton until they
reach maturity at two years of age. Mature herring migrate to deeper
water, feeding on various organisms such as crustaceans, mollusks, worms
and other small fish.

[[Herring]{.mark} are an important [keystone species]{.mark} on the
Great Bear Coast and [are considered the foundation of the coastal food
web]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their importance for the coastal food web
begins when they are eggs, as [[their spawning grounds become a]{.mark}
weeks-long [feast for]{.mark} many marine species and coastal land
mammals]{.underline}, including **[[black bears, wolves, sea lions,
seals, humpback whales, gray whales, orcas, and
birds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They converge on the spawning grounds to
feed on herring and their eggs. The [herring spawn is so important to
the Great Bear Coast ecosystem that [surf scoters and gray whales time
their northward migrations to feast]{.mark} on it]{.underline}. In the
wider Great Bear Sea, herring are an [[essential part of]{.mark} the
[diet]{.mark} [of]{.mark} many fish]{.underline}. For example, the diets
of [[Chinook Salmon, Coho Salmon, and Lingcod]{.mark} consist of 62%,
58%, and 71% herring, respectivel]{.underline}y. This means that herring
transfer the energy from the plankton they feed on as juveniles to the
entire Great Bear Coast ecosystem. **[[Herring]{.mark} literally
[power]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Great Bear [Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Why are Herring Important for Communities on The Great Bear Coast?

Herring are the foundation of Great Bear Coast communities, with First
Nations' harvesting of this fish going back at least 10,000 years. In
fact, "[throughout the Pacific Northwest, herring bones are among the
most abundant fish remains found in ancient coastal settlements,
indicating that herring were a critical food resource]{.underline}." One
traditional herring harvesting technique First Nations use is the
sustainable spawn on kelp. Instead of taking the entire fish, roe on
kelp involves harvesting the roe from hemlock branches, seaweed, or
kelp. [Herring roe is a source of protein, iron, vitamin B1, and
riboflavin for coastal First Nations]{.underline}. This sustainable
practice stands in contrast to the herring sac roe kill fishery.

The importance of herring for our coast and coastal communities extends
beyond the spawn on kelp fishery, as [[herring]{.mark} are [prey for
many commercial species, including salmon, halibut, lingcod, sablefish,
and rockfish]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[If herring disappeared]{.mark}
from our coast, these species and [many]{.mark} more [would experience
population collapses]{.mark}**, which would have a negative economic
impact on the coastal communities]{.underline}. It is important to
understand that [herring exist in an ecosystem that greatly depends on
them]{.underline}. Therefore, from a fisheries management perspective,
herring need to be managed as part of the larger ecosystem instead of
being considered in isolation --- an approach that has contributed to
the current herring population declines.

#### Biodiversity loss is [existential]{.underline}.

**Torres 16** \[Émile P. Torres; Émile P. Torres is a philosopher and
historian whose work focuses on existential threats to civilization and
humanity; 4-11-2016; Biodiversity loss: An existential risk comparable
to climate change; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists;
https://thebulletin.org/2016/04/biodiversity-loss-an-existential-risk-comparable-to-climate-change;
Accessed 7-21-2025;\] KK

But [there is [another existential threat]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
Bulletin overlooked in its Doomsday Clock announcement:
[[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss]{.mark}]{.underline}. This phenomenon is
often identified as one of the many consequences of climate change, and
this is of course correct. But biodiversity loss is also a contributing
factor behind climate change. For example, deforestation in the Amazon
rainforest and elsewhere reduces the amount of carbon dioxide removed
from the atmosphere by plants, a natural process that mitigates the
effects of climate change. So the causal relation between climate change
and biodiversity loss is bidirectional.

Furthermore, there are myriad phenomena that are driving biodiversity
loss in addition to climate change. Other causes include [[ecosystem
fragmentation]{.mark}, invasive species, pollution, oxygen
depletion]{.underline} caused by fertilizers running off into ponds and
streams, [[overfishing]{.mark}, human overpopulation, and
overconsumption]{.underline}. All of these phenomena have a [[direct
impact on]{.mark} the health of the [biosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
all would conceivably persist even if the problem of climate change were
somehow immediately solved.

Such considerations warrant decoupling biodiversity loss from climate
change, because the former has been consistently subsumed by the latter
as a mere effect. Biodiversity loss is a distinct environmental crisis
with its own unique syndrome of causes, consequences, and
solutions---such as restoring habitats, creating protected areas
("biodiversity parks"), and practicing sustainable agriculture.

[The [sixth extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. The repercussions of
biodiversity loss are potentially as severe as those anticipated from
climate change, or even a nuclear conflict. For example, according to a
2015 study published in Science Advances, the best available evidence
reveals "an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few
centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under
way." This conclusion holds, even on the most optimistic assumptions
about the background rate of species losses and the current rate of
vertebrate extinctions. The group classified as "vertebrates" includes
mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and all other creatures with a backbone.

The article argues that, using its conservative figures, the average
loss of vertebrate species was 100 times higher in the past century
relative to the background rate of extinction. (Other scientists have
suggested that the current extinction rate could be as much as 10,000
times higher than normal.) As the authors write, "The evidence is
incontrovertible that recent extinction rates are unprecedented in human
history and highly unusual in Earth's history." [Perhaps the term "Big
Six" should enter the popular lexicon---to add the current extinction to
the previous "Big Five," the last of which wiped out the dinosaurs 66
million years ago.]{.underline}

But the concept of biodiversity encompasses more than just the total
number of species on the planet. It also refers to the size of different
populations of species. With respect to this phenomenon, multiple
studies have confirmed that wild populations around the world are
dwindling and disappearing at an alarming rate. For example, the 2010
Global Biodiversity Outlook report found that the population of wild
vertebrates living in the tropics dropped by 59 percent between 1970 and
2006.

The report also found that the population of farmland birds in Europe
has dropped by 50 percent since 1980; bird populations in the grasslands
of North America declined by almost 40 percent between 1968 and 2003;
and the population of birds in North American arid lands has fallen by
almost 30 percent since the 1960s. Similarly, 42 percent of all
amphibian species (a type of vertebrate that is sometimes called an
"ecological indicator") are undergoing population declines, and 23
percent of all plant species "are estimated to be threatened with
extinction." Other studies have found that some 20 percent of all
reptile species, 48 percent of the world's primates, and 50 percent of
freshwater turtles are threatened. Underwater, about 10 percent of all
coral reefs are now dead, and another 60 percent are in danger of dying.

Consistent with these data, the 2014 Living Planet Report shows that the
[global [population of wild vertebrates dropped]{.mark} by [52 percent
in]{.mark} only [four]{.mark} [decades]{.mark}]{.underline}---from 1970
to 2010. While biologists often avoid projecting historical trends into
the future because of the complexity of ecological systems, it's
tempting to extrapolate this figure to, say, the year 2050, which is
four decades from 2010. As it happens, a 2006 study published in Science
does precisely this: It projects past trends of marine biodiversity loss
into the 21st century, concluding that, unless significant changes are
made to patterns of human activity, there will be [virtually [no]{.mark}
more wild-caught [seafood by 2048]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Catastrophic consequences for civilization. The consequences of this
rapid pruning of the evolutionary tree of life extend beyond the
obvious. There could be surprising effects of biodiversity loss that
scientists are unable to fully anticipate in advance. For example, prior
research has shown that localized ecosystems can undergo abrupt and
irreversible shifts when they reach a tipping point. According to a 2012
paper published in Nature, there are reasons for thinking that we may be
approaching a tipping point of this sort in the global ecosystem, beyond
which the consequences could be catastrophic for civilization.

As the authors write, a planetary-scale transition could precipitate
"[[substantial losses of ecosystem services required to sustain the
human population]{.underline}]{.mark}." An ecosystem service is any
ecological process that benefits humanity, such as food production and
crop pollination. [[If]{.mark} the global [ecosystem]{.mark} were to
[cross a tipping point]{.mark} and substantial ecosystem services were
lost, the results could be "[widespread social unrest, economic
instability, and loss of human life]{.mark}]{.underline}." According to
Missouri Botanical Garden ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's
co-authors, this could occur in a matter of decades---far more quickly
than most of the expected consequences of climate change, yet equally
destructive.

[[Biod]{.mark}iversity [loss is a "threat multiplier]{.mark}" that, by
pushing societies to the brink of collapse, will [exacerbate existing
conflicts and introduce entirely new struggles between state and
non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, it could [even [fuel the
rise of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}. (After all, climate change has
been [[linked to]{.mark} the [emergence of ISIS in
Syria]{.mark}]{.underline}, and multiple high-ranking US officials, such
as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA director John
Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism are connected.)

[The reality is that [we are entering the sixth mass extinction]{.mark}
in the 3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth]{.underline}, and the
impact of this event could be felt by civilization "in as little as
three human lifetimes," as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper notes.
Furthermore, the widespread decline of biological populations could
plausibly initiate a dramatic transformation of the global ecosystem on
an even faster timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime.

The unavoidable conclusion is that [[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss]{.mark}
constitutes [an existential threat]{.mark} in its own
right]{.underline}. As such, it ought to be considered alongside climate
change and nuclear weapons as one of the most significant contemporary
risks to human prosperity and survival.

One reason is because herring spawn mostly near the ocean floor where
CO2 levels are highest. As a result, herring larvae have adapted to the

surface. [[More CO2]{.mark} in the oceans in the future could [mean a

Another reason herring seem to thrive in these conditions is also [[due
to]{.mark} their [increased food supply in CO2-concentrated

study that concluded that herring populations suffer from malnutrition
and organ damage due to one glaring difference: studies of contemporary

herring food supplies. [[Scientists predict]{.mark} that in the future,

Peoples have sustainably fished in this region from time immemorial.
However, certain commercial fishing practices, such as bottom trawling,
can have [destructive impacts on the Great Bear Sea's ecosystem, and
management of these practices is key to ensuring that the area can
continue to thrive as a resource provider for local
fisheries]{.underline}.

2\. Tourism: [The natural beauty and rich biodiversity of the Great Bear
Sea attract tourists from around the world]{.underline}. Activities such
as wildlife viewing, whale watching, kayaking, and eco-tourism
contribute significantly to the local economy. Visitors come to
experience the wilderness, Indigenous cultural tours, and opportunities
to spot wildlife like bears and killer whales.

3\. Research and Education: [The area's unique marine ecosystems and
rich biodiversity make it a valuable location for scientific research
and education]{.underline}. Research institutions and universities
conduct studies here, creating opportunities for research-related
economic activities.

4\. Conservation: The establishment of conservation initiatives,
including Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and sustainable resource
management practices, not only contributes to ecological health but also
supports the creation of eco-friendly jobs through the training of
Indigenous Guardians.

It's important to note that [the [economic importance of the]{.mark}
Great Bear [Sea]{.mark} is closely [linked to its environmental health
and sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many stakeholders in the
region, including Indigenous communities, environmental organizations,
and government bodies, work together to balance economic activities with
conservation efforts to ensure the long-term well-being of this valuable
marine ecosystem. If overfishing and other harmful activities continue
on the Great Bear Sea coast, the results will be devastating for coastal
communities and the coastal economy.

Why Does the Great Bear Sea Need to be Protected?

[The historical [biodiversity and abundance of the Great Bear
Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} has attracted industrial fishing, which has
caused habitat destruction and a decline in species numbers and
ecosystem health. For instance, [First Nations' access to sockeye and
Chinook is down 82% and 66%, respectively]{.underline}. The DFO recently
revealed that in the 2023 Option A groundfish trawl tossed away over
28,000 salmon as bycatch. Current industrial fishing practices are
proving to be unsustainable and have put [[more than 30 species at
risk]{.mark}, including salmon, herring, northern abalone, killer
whales, blue whales, basking sharks, sei whales, yelloweye rockfish, and
ancient glass sponge reefs]{.underline}.

Moreover, [First Nations have lived on the Great Bear Coast for
millennia and are connected to the land and waters they have stewarded
and sustained for generations]{.underline}. The [[decline of the Great
Bear Coast's health negatively impacts the economic and cultural health
of many]{.underline}]{.mark} First Nation [[coastal
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

GREENWIRE \| East Coast [[fishermen]{.mark} are [bracing
for]{.mark}]{.underline} what could be the [[tightest catch
limits]{.mark} in history [for]{.mark} Atlantic [herring, **a keystone
species** whose population nosedive since 2020 is rippling through the
Atlantic fisheries ecosystem]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Last week, scientists working for the New England Fishery Management
Council endorsed a [[record-low catch cap of 2,710 metric tons]{.mark}
of Atlantic herring for 2025]{.underline} with hopes of avoiding full
collapse of the nutrient-dense forage fish.

[The new catch limits]{.underline}, if adopted by NOAA Fisheries, would
be a [[43 percent drop from the previous record-low cap]{.mark} of 4,814
tons in 2022.]{.underline}

Some have said such [a restriction [would effectively end the Atlantic
herring fishery]{.mark}]{.underline}, rendering it a bycatch species
without a viable market. Almost all ocean herring today is sold as
lobster bait, with only a fraction going for human consumption.

Once ubiquitous off the New England and mid-Atlantic coasts, ocean
herring have experienced severe population swings over the last decade.

The species' perilous state weighed heavily on fishermen, regulators and
ocean advocates following last week's presentation of NOAA's latest
stock assessment report to NEFMC's Scientific and Technical Committee.
[The deepest cuts in catch limits could come in the Gulf of Maine and
Georges Bank area north of Cape Cod extending south to New
Jersey]{.underline}.

"I want to speak of the tragedy that we're in now. [[This fishery is
over]{.underline}]{.mark}," Jeff Kaelin, director of sustainability and
government affairs at Lund's Fisheries, one of the East Coast's largest
seafood distributors, said after learning of the council's possible
upcoming recommendation to NOAA, which would impose the caps.

One possible regulation on herring fishing operations that NOAA imposed
in 2020 --- a requirement that fishermen pay the federal government for
monitors on their boats --- is tied up in the courts.

The industry challenged that mandate, going all the way to the Supreme
Court, which overturned the Chevron doctrine precedent that gave
agencies like NOAA greater leeway to impose regulations --- like the
monitoring requirement --- that aren't explicitly spelled out in federal
law. But the court didn't specifically rule on NOAA's herring monitoring
policy, telling lower courts to figure out if it is permissible under
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

[Managing the herring fishery has turned out to be a
challenge]{.underline}. Despite 25 years of effort --- including a
restrictive five-year stock rebuilding plan implemented in 2022 ---
[[the]{.mark} small, oily, nutrient-dense [fish]{.mark} that once
supported an ocean ecosystem and major commercial fishery has [slid ever
closer to extirpation from the East Coast]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Jamie Cournane, NEFMC's lead fishery analyst for Atlantic herring,
acknowledged during the council committee meeting that recovery
projections have been "overly optimistic" and that key recovery
benchmarks thought to be achievable by next year will shift to between
2027 and 2031.

Cournane said the new timeline, combined with additional regulation, is
"going to have some very clear and already apparent socioeconomic
consequences to the industry and shoreside infrastructure that supports
the fishery."

The floundering recovery could also [[**foreshadow broader ecosystem
troubles** in the Atlantic Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the
[decline of other prized commercial species like cod, haddock and tuna,
which feed on herring or their eggs, as well as birds and marine mammals
that depend on the small fish]{.underline}.

"Everyone is waking up to the fact that we've done a terrible job
managing this fishery, so now we're trying to fill the gaps in our
scientific understanding and management policies," said Jaclyn Higgins,
the forage fish project manager at the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation
Partnership, which has closely followed the recovery plan.

Yet the answers are elusive. Some call herring's decline a mystery,
while others insist there are systemic problems inhibiting the
recruitment of more fish, including spawners whose eggs are laid in
thick mats on ocean bottoms.

Environmental groups and some small boat fishermen also believe that
nets deployed by large midwater trawlers have captured herring at
unsustainable levels in the most productive waters, resulting in
"localized depletion."

"[The [herring caught by]{.mark} these giant [ships can't even be
sold]{.mark} as seafood]{.underline} --- they get crushed in the nets
and end up sold as low-quality bait," the Boston-based Conservation Law
Foundation wrote in a 2019 herring assessment.

That assessment came two years before NOAA adopted an acceptable
biological catch rule to reduce fish mortality, including prohibiting
large trawlers from fishing in nearshore waters. That move was
overturned in 2022 by a federal judge, who found that the New England
fisheries council had not provided sufficient scientific evidence for
localized depletion. The ruling was not appealed by the Justice
Department.

The council now is again considering regulations that could restrict
where and how herring are fished.

Atlantic herring are distinct from river herring and shad, which occupy
the same ocean habitat for much of the year but spawn in coastal
streams.

In its stock assessment, NOAA Fisheries said the species remained
overfished, meaning its population is below the threshold for a healthy
fishery. But it is not currently experiencing overfishing due to more
stringent restrictions placed on the industry since 2022.

Still, [Atlantic [herring]{.mark} has [continued a decade-long
slide]{.mark}, particularly [since 2013]{.mark} when the fishermen
caught nearly 96,000 metric tons of herring, according to NOAA Fisheries
data]{.underline}.

"There's something happening that we can't quite pinpoint that's not
allowing for a strong cohort to enter into the fishery and produce more
fish," said Higgins of TRCP.

Experts note that Atlantic herring have seen declines before. Spawning
stock saw a steep drop between 1965 and 1980, driven in part by
overfishing by Russian trawlers that harvested millions of tons of
herring from U.S. territorial waters in the North Atlantic and Pacific
basins. [[Geopolitical tension over fisheries]{.underline}]{.mark} was
among the drivers of what came to be the Magnuson-Stevens Act passed in
1976.

The U.S. Atlantic herring fishery rebounded during the late 1980s and
'90s, peaking again in the early 2000s before beginning a gradual
drop-off that accelerated in the 2010s. Herring's highest recruitment
year was 1971, according to the New England Fishery Management Council.

Janice Plante, a council spokesperson, said Atlantic herring has become
one of the most confounding U.S. fisheries over the past decade because
of its [[population volatility]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"There have been times when the biomass was absolutely enormous, now
it's at a really low level, and recruitment into the fishery has been
very poor for several years," she said. "Yet there's not a good reason
for it because the [[fishing level on the stock is very, very
low]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The Fisheries-Food Security-Conflict Nexus

[Human communities and their physical environments do not exist in
isolation]{.underline}. The behavior of fishers (e.g., effort spent
fishing, the species targeted) cannot be separated from the abundance of
fish. Likewise, the abundance of fish is significantly affected by how,
when, and where fishers fish.

![Fisheries and Violence](media/image2.png){width="3.84968394575678in"
height="1.7182206911636047in"}

 

The [[links between fisheries and armed conflict]{.mark} contain such
feedbacks, depicted here as a coupled human and natural
system.]{.underline} The human system on the left contains conflict,
livelihoods, and food security. [If [unemployment]{.mark} [increases and
people cannot afford]{.mark} nutritious food like [fish, **food
insecurity and**]{.mark} ]{.underline}the [likelihood of
**[conflict ]{.mark}increase**]{.underline}. During conflict, people may
lose their homes and jobs. Food becomes more scarce and expensive, which
increases how much effort people put into fishing.

On the right of the diagram, the natural system contains fish and the
small plants and animals that feed them. If top predators like tuna or
sharks decline, the abundance of other fish and their prey will change
in response. Complicated food webs and fishing pressure ultimately
affect the abundance and therefore catch of fish. [[Good **fish catch
supports food and income**]{.mark}, while [poor catch reduces
it]{.mark}, feeding back into the conditions that start or stop
conflict.]{.underline}

Ultimately, what does this mean? It's complicated, yes, but whether
fishing causes or prevents conflict is subject to a tangled web of
factors and timing.

Fisheries Can Cause Armed Conflict

[[Armed conflict]{.mark} can [occur over fisheries
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}. The infamous 20th century [[Cod Wars
between Iceland and the UK]{.mark} showed nations were willing to
[defend coveted fishing grounds with military
force]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Lake Victoria, the Ugandan army has
confronted Kenyan fishers over an island on their shared border. Off the
Horn of Africa, disputes between foreign and domestic fishing vessels
have been implicated in the rise of piracy and hostage taking. Such
conflicts are about boats and fishers being in the same place at the
same time. This reflects access rights to the fish, not necessarily
concern over a decline in fish abundance. These conflicts are likely
opportunistic, discrete occurrences that can be mitigated by territorial
integrity (e.g., clearly delineated and enforced borders) by nations and
comprehensive co-management in fishing villages.

[When overfishing or habitat damage cause fish populations to decline,
the resulting conflict will be systemic and long-term.]{.underline} Fish
stocks may crash suddenly and unpredictably, or their decline may be
gradual and predictable. In the first case, the shock to livelihoods and
food security will be quick. In the second case, fishers will expend
more and more effort to catch fewer and fewer fish. Either way[,
conflict will occur directly over the shrinking state of the resource
and indirectly as unemployment and food security worsen.]{.underline}
Conflict over a declining resource base can be mitigated two ways: 1)
sound conservation and management to preserve sustainability, and 2)
livelihood diversification to provide alternative sources of income
during fishing downturns.

Fisheries Can Prevent Conflict

[[Fisheries provide **food and livelihood security**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} many of the world's [poorest
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fish contains high-quality protein,
omega-3 fatty acids, and essential micronutrients -- calcium, iron, zinc
-- that support brain growth and nutrition. Over 56 million people were
employed in the fishing sector in 2014, 20% of which were women. Income
from fisheries, especially in the hands of women, translates to
education for children. [All of these factors ensure community stability
and thus reduce the root causes of armed conflict]{.underline}. More
directly, when men (and sometimes youth) are productively employed, they
are less likely to join militia groups.

[[Fisheries management]{.mark} also provides [avenues for cooperation
between nations that share fish stocks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Lake
Victoria Fisheries Organization unites the governments and the fishers
of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania to manage shared fisheries resources. The
model of co-management used around Lake Victoria has
promoted cooperation, not competition, between fishers and fishing
villages. And [transboundary [fishery collaboration is one productive
way to reduce conflict]{.mark} over resources that cross national
borders. ]{.underline}

[In a controlled experiment by German, Swedish, and Norwegian
scientist]{.underline}s, [[herring]{.mark} [larvae]{.mark} surprisingly
[thrive]{.mark}d [in environments where CO2 levels]{.mark} were
[high]{.mark}]{.underline}. Specifically, these scientists created an
environment [[based on predictions of CO2 levels at the end of the
century]{.mark} and [found]{.mark} that these [herring larvae]{.mark}
are actually [predicted to fare better in the future]{.mark} than they
do at present]{.underline}.

One reason is because herring spawn mostly near the ocean floor where
CO2 levels are highest. As a result, herring larvae have adapted to the
changing oceans more so than, for instance, cod which spawns near the
surface. [[More CO2]{.mark} in the oceans in the future could [mean a
flourishing herring population]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another reason herring seem to thrive in these conditions is also [[due
to]{.mark} their [increased food supply in CO2-concentrated
oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}. This evidence goes directly against a 2014
study that concluded that herring populations suffer from malnutrition
and organ damage due to one glaring difference: studies of contemporary
herring populations consider the damage rising CO2 levels have caused to
herring food supplies. [[Scientists predict]{.mark} that in the future,
increased algae blooms will produce a booming population of zooplankton
(a herring food source). This, in turn, would [improve herring survival

Atlantic herring are small, streamlined fish reaching up to 10-14 inches
(25-35 centimeters) in length that form enormous schools in the open
waters and offshore banks of the Gulf of Maine. [[Herring hold a key
spot in]{.mark} the middle of [the food chain]{.mark}. [They filter
plankton]{.mark} from the water [and are an **important food source**
for large predators]{.mark} such as tuna, whales and
sharks.]{.underline} "They eat really small things and are eaten by
really big things," Baker said. "They are some of the most nutritious
foods available for the animals that feed on them."

[[Herring have long been important for humans as
well]{.underline}]{.mark}. Traditionally, they were harvested from
fixed-gear traps called weirs, or caught in purse-seine nets drawn
around their schools as they surfaced at night to feed on plankton. In
parts of Canada, such as the Bay of Fundy, herring harvest methods are
still fairly traditional, said Gary Melvin, a herring scientist at the
Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans Biological Station in St.
Andrews, New Brunswick. [In U.S. waters, on the other hand, the face of
the herring fishery has changed. In the last decade or so, large boats
known as midwater trawlers have become the norm---and the source of much
of the current controversy over the fishery.]{.underline}

The latest NOAA Fisheries assessment reveals [that Atlantic herring, a
key species for the Northeast's fishing industry, remains
overfished]{.underline}, though overfishing is no longer occurring. The
newest stock assessment includes the latest catch data, survey results,
and life history factors. While fishing pressure is under control, the
long-term outlook for Atlantic herring remains highly uncertain.

[[Atlantic herring is a vital species]{.mark} in the Northeast [due to
its role]{.mark} [in the **marine ecosystems**]{.mark}, its [value to
the]{.mark} [**economy**, and its importance as a]{.mark} substantial
**[bait]{.mark} source for fishermen**]{.underline}. According to
sources, the Connecticut River blueback herring runs have plummeted from
highs of 630,000 fish in 1985 to 283 in 2022.

As of 2023, the Atlantic herring spawning stock biomass is 47,955 metric
tons, which is only 26% of the target level. The herring population
remains well below the desired biomass for sustainability. However,
fishing pressure is under control. The fishing mortality rate, focusing
on older herring (ages 7-8), is 0.263---well below the threshold of 0.45
that would indicate overfishing.

[[The latest Atlantic herring assessment highlights several
uncertainties]{.mark} that impact the stock's biomass, [fishing
mortality, recruitment, and population projections]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[One major uncertainty is the ongoing poor recruitment]{.underline},
which has yet to be fully explained. Despite decades of research in
fisheries science, pinpointing the exact reasons for low recruitment
remains a challenge. Additionally, the assessment assumes constant
natural mortality across ages and years, though varying natural
mortality in past assessments has not been fully supported over time.
While uncertainty in natural mortality impacts abundance and F
estimates, it's unlikely the main factor behind poor recruitment.

#### Herring loss will trigger the tipping point

The herring fisheries impact on other species

[A [lost herring stock]{.mark} in the Baltic Sea would [cause even
larger consequences]{.mark} than the cod collapse. [Herring is the
engine of the Baltic Sea ecosystem]{.mark}, and the high fishing
pressure on herring, that has moved closer to the coast, has a large
impact on other species]{.underline}. A study shows, for example, that
h[igh fishing pressure on herring in the northern [Baltic Sea can have
major effects on the **salmon fishery and its
profitability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to a salmon fishery close
to zero some years. Since herring is the main food source for amongst
other seals, [salmon can become a new target species when the seal seeks
other food]{.underline} sources due to reduced herring stocks. The same
reason is believed to contribute to the sharp decline in pike stocks in
the archipelago in recent years, a development that Stockholm's County
fisheries consultant Henrik C Andersson calls "[[an ecological
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}". Herring is also the main food source for
porpoises, seabirds, and cod, and plays thus a major role in the
recovery of cod stocks.\
\
[[As herring stocks decrease, the food sources that herring normally
eats increase]{.underline}]{.mark}. This development can be beneficial
toother species, such as stickleback, as it competes for food with
herring. In recent years, there has been a stickleback "explosion", a
phenomenon that the SLU Aqua researcher Ulf Bergström compare with
"grasshopper swarms". The stickleback eats other species' eggs and
larvae which in turn can affect these stocks negatively -- such as pike
and perch. [The dominance of [sticklebacks]{.mark} in the ecosystem [is
looked upon as a regime  shift, **a tipping point, in the Baltic
Sea**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in addition the species also benefits from
eutrophication, climate change and the shortage of cod.

through 2100]{.underline}.

[[The study found]{.mark} that [rising sea surface temperatures]{.mark}
(SSTs) and associated large-scale climatic patterns are generally
[pushing herring to spawn earlier]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, these
changes in [herring spawn timing varied significantly across
regions]{.underline}. For example, the waters along the Inside Passage
could see herring spawning approximately two weeks earlier by the end of
the century, while ecosystems located on the outer coast of Southeast
Alaska may see changes in spawning timing of only a few days.

Harley and co-authors postulate that [[even small shifts in spawn
timing]{.mark} could [disrupt the synchronization between herring and
the species that rely on them]{.mark}, potentially [leading to
mismatches in food availability]{.mark}]{.underline}. This asynchrony
could ripple through the ecosystem, [[affecting the survival and
reproduction of dependent species such as seals, seabirds and
whales]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Predators]{.underline} may even [change
their migration patterns as they search for other food sources or
herring populations in regions that display smaller shifts in spawn
timing.]{.underline}

#### Lack of herring being caught is [directly linked]{.underline} to climate change.

[Decades of [research show a]{.mark} slow [decline in herring
stocks]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and scientists
are [[linking]{.mark} that [decline to waters]{.mark} that are [warming
with climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Recent research from [NASA found that about [90 per cent of global
warming is occurring in the ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Joël Chassé, an oceanographer with
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, said [[11 of 12 months]{.mark} last year
[had warmer than normal]{.mark} surface
[temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and he expects a similar pattern
this year.

\"We had a very mild winter with barely any ice,\" Chassé said. \"The
heat was not pumped out of the gulf during the winter, so there is still
quite a bit of heat in the water column. So we can expect warmer than
usual conditions again this year.\"

That impact is more pronounced in the Northumberland Strait, where the
shallower waters are more directly impacted by air temperatures and less
by cold water flowing from the Atlantic Ocean.

Data from Environment Canada for May found surface temperatures close to
normal for most of the gulf, but mostly above average in the
Northumberland Strait and in shallow waters along the northern
coastlines of Nova Scotia.

Herring hiding out

[October 2023 was a particularly warm month for the gulf]{.underline}.
That was especially a [[problem for the population of herring that
spawns in the fall]{.underline},]{.mark} and for the fishermen seeking
them out.

\"Fishermen in northern New Brunswick, the Baie des Chaleur region, were
having difficulty finding the fish,\" said Jacob Burbank, a researcher
in fish ecology with Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

\"[[They weren\'t seeing]{.mark} Atlantic [herring where they normally
would see]{.mark} Atlantic [herring]{.mark}. They [kept waiting for them
to come in]{.mark} for their spawning and they [just didn\'t see
them]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

It\'s easier to essentially starve. --- Jacob Burbank

Burbank\'s theory, which is still to be confirmed, is that the
[[fish]{.mark} were [staying out in deeper water, which is
colder]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Recent decades have seen a general decline in herring
stocks]{.underline}]{.mark}, Burbank said.

[One [clear cause is the warmer water itself]{.mark}. [Surviving in
warmer water requires more energy]{.mark} of the herring. In addition,
[the biomass of the zoo plankton the herring feed on is also going
down]{.mark} as the water warms.]{.underline}

\"**[[It\'s much easier to starve]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Burbank
said. \"If there\'s less food, but you need more food, it\'s easier to
essentially starve.\"

No signs of herring stocks rebounding 2 years into moratorium, DFO says

How warming waters around P.E.I. could affect snow crab and lobster

[Researchers have found that [herring have grown smaller over the last
30 years]{.mark}, and Burbank said those [smaller herring aren\'t laying
as many eggs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

That, combined with young herring having a more difficult time reaching
adulthood, is leading to an overall decline.

#### Ocean Acidification is BAD

While [[fish]{.underline}]{.mark} don\'t have shells, they will [still
[feel]{.mark} the [effects of acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Because the [surrounding [water has a lower pH]{.mark}, a fish\'s cells
often come into balance with the seawater by taking in carbonic
acid]{.underline}. This [[changes the pH of the fish\'s blood]{.mark}, a
condition called acidosis]{.underline}.

Although [the fish is then in harmony with its environment, many of the
[chemical reactions that take place in its body]{.mark} can be
[altered]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just a [[small change in pH can make a
huge difference in survival]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In humans, for
instance, a drop in blood pH of 0.2-0.3 can cause seizures, comas, and
even death]{.underline}. [Likewise, a [fish]{.mark} is also [sensitive
to pH and has to put its body into overdrive to bring]{.mark} its
[chemistry back to normal]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To do so, [[it
will burn extra energy to excrete the excess acid out of its
blood]{.mark} through its gills, kidneys and intestines]{.underline}. It
might not seem like this would use a lot of energy, but [[**even a
slight increase reduces the energy a fish has to take care of other
tasks**, such as digesting food, swimming rapidly to escape predators or
catch food, and reproducing]{.mark}. It can also slow fishes
growth]{.underline}.

Even slightly more [[acidic water]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[also
affects fishes\' minds]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [clownfish can
normally hear]{.underline} and avoid noisy [predators, [in]{.mark} more
[acidic water]{.mark}, [they do not flee threatening
noise]{.mark}]{.underline}. Clown[fish [also stray farther from home and
have trouble \"smelling\" their way back]{.mark}]{.underline}. This may
happen because [[acidification]{.mark}, which changes the pH of a
fish\'s body and brain, could [alter how the brain processes
information]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, cobia (a kind of popular
game fish) grow larger otoliths---small ear bones that affect hearing
and balance---[in more acidic water, which could affect their ability to
navigate and avoid prey]{.underline}. While there is still a lot to
learn, these findings suggest that we may see unpredictable changes in
animal behavior under acidification.

The ability to adapt to higher acidity will vary from fish species to
fish species, and what qualities will help or hurt a given fish species
is unknown. [[A shift in dominant fish species could have major impacts
on the food web and on human fisheries]{.underline}]{.mark}.
