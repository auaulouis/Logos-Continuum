We note here how this history of [[settler-state formation, along
with]{.mark} its commitment to [capitalist development, is **hardly
limited** to]{.mark} the [Canadia]{.mark}n case**. [A dialectical
figure]{.mark}** [emerges that]{.mark} [combines]{.mark} features of
dependence, antagonism, and production: [the **dependence of the
capitalist state on Indigenous land and resources; the
antagonism**]{.mark} posed [by the state toward Indigenous forms of
life]{.mark} and vice-versa; all of]{.underline} [**[which
produces]{.mark}** the specific and contradictory political terrain
animating the settler colonial moment of the totality]{.underline}. This
speaks to the specifically negative character of [[this **totality**
maintained by antagonism rather than solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Adorno 1968, 44). [[The mediations]{.mark} [involved]{.mark} in this
totality [benefit from]{.mark} another [figure]{.mark} of dialectical
analysis, namely [that something can be]{.mark} simultaneously [true and
false---which is]{.mark} exactly [how we should treat the view that
Indigenous peoples are parts of the settler state]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is true in the sense [that [**colonization involves** this]{.mark}
aforementioned dependence of the capitalist state on Indigenous land and
resources, antagonism of the state toward Indigenous cultures and ways
of life, and production of **a [contradictory settler colonial
totality]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But [it is false in the sense that
Indigenous forms of life challenge and disrupt]{.underline} the process
of [colonization]{.underline}. Coulthard invokes something like Adorno's
negative totality and contrasts it with a more affirmative conception of
totality, characterized more by solidarity than antagonism:
["\[u\]nderstanding 'culture' as the]{.underline} interconnected [social
totality of \[a\]]{.underline} distinct [mode of life encompassing the
economic, political, spiritual, and social is crucial]{.underline} for
comprehending the state's response to the challenge posed by our \[the
Dene Nation's\] land-claim proposals" (2014, 65--6). [The Dene cannot be
recognized properly by the colonial state without also acknowledging
"alternative Indigenous economies and forms of political authority."
[The colonial state]{.mark}, according to Coulthard, [will only allow
institutionalized]{.mark} accommodations of [Indigenous practices so
long as they are "reconcilable with]{.mark} one political formation --
namely[, colonial sovereignty -- and]{.mark} one mode of production --
namely[, capitalism"]{.mark} (66). [The colonial state's]{.mark}
unavoidable [participation in **global capitalism means** that]{.mark}
**[alt]{.mark}**ernative [mode**s** of life]{.mark} **[are impossible to
achieve without anti-colonial struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Coulthard's understanding of culture as a totality further draws out the
political implications of totality thinking. He cautions resurgence
theorists and practitioners from assuming the possibility of avoiding or
escaping some of the parts at the expense of a view of the totality to
which they belong. [Coulthard argues that [**a resurgence of
Indigenous**]{.mark} forms o[f life risk **becom**]{.mark}**ing
["parasitic" on capitalism]{.mark}** [when]{.mark} (at the individual
level) [wages or]{.mark} (at the collective level) resource [revenue
sharing is required to fund resurgent practices]{.mark}]{.underline}
(2014, 171). The effect of which is [to de-economize Indigenous
self-determination and de-politicize capitalism]{.underline}: "... [in
the end \[[such practices]{.mark}\] would still [remain dependent on a
predatory economy]{.mark} [that is]{.mark} entirely [at odds with
the]{.mark} deep [reciprocity that forms the cultural core]{.mark} of
many [Indigenous peoples' relationships with land]{.mark}"
(ibid]{.underline}.). Coulthard's work presents settler colonialism as
part of a contradictory totality that [demands a politics of resurgence
that does not lose sight of that totality as an object to be
transcended.]{.underline} Bearing our various distinctions between
structure and totality in mind, we want to offer a more concrete defense
of totality contra an influential yet explicitly anti-structuralist
thinker of decolonization in Canada: John Borrows.

### 1NC---Alt---Decolonization

There is no adequate English word for \"beyond colonization.\" The best
English-ish phrases that I have heard are Kale Fajardo\'s
\"trans\*colonial\" and \"**[shadow sovereignty]{.underline}**\" as
theorized by Native literary scholars.4 For Craig Womack,
[[**sovereignty** is]{.mark} more deeрly [expressed in the dynamic
language of literature]{.mark} than in the restrictive definitions of
treaty law]{.underline}. In Womack\'s fictional writing, the tie-snakes
are an underwater kingdom of monsters, \"something white man has never
saw or caught,\" that seem like a metaphor for a world beyond
colonization.5 Greg [Sarris sums up this deeper **sovereignty** very
simply: \"It\'s not like anything.\"]{.underline}16 Certainly freedom
when spoken with an African diasporic accent gestures toward radical
elsewheres, elusive destinations made possible by the very audacity to
dream freedom.\" [Such words are already more than English. [The word
**postcolonial is disappointing** as far as bringing about
**decolonization** and is at best shorthand for the complexities of
contemporary colonial crap.]{.mark}]{.underline} I only find it useful
when an awkward + glyph adds other meanings into it: the post+-
colonial. Posts+ are the postings or updates on
**[colonialism]{.underline}**, the posts or appointed roles within
colonizing institutions, the out- posts where colonial force needs
fortification-but also the postscripts or personal codicils that exceed
the well-organized colo- nial script. [[Posts+ are not \"exit signs\"
from **colonialism**]{.mark}, like the way postracial or postcolonial is
sometimes conceived, but sites for reanalyzing colonial and decolonial
activities. Apprehending the post+colonial is to feel the beyond and
before of it, \"the not yet and, at times, the not anymore\" of
Indigenous **sovereign** land and life.]{.underline}19 [[In other words,
**decolonization** is the double movement of antico- lonialism and
rematriation-restoring the futures that Indigenous land and life were
meant to follow.]{.mark} [This]{.mark} double [movement is the
fundamental charge of a **third world university**]{.mark}. [To
understand the possibilities for a **decolonizing university**, we must
begin with a discussion of **colonialism,** particularly the
**colonizing machine\'s desires** to settle, to self-sustain, to seduce,
and to school.]{.mark}]{.underline} This discussion will be informed by
my perspective in writing from North America, a settler colonial
context, the details of which are not universal. However, even though
the analysis is particular to American empire, through it, I unpack the
technol- ogies of colonialism that circulate everywhere-particularly the
technologies of colonial schooling. [More importantly, [this analysis
urges us to recognize the queer appropriations of these same
technologies toward Indigenous and Black and **decolonial
futures**]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a small book, there are histories and
trajectories untold in these pages. I hope you will read this book in
relationship to Craig Steven Wilder\'s Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and
the Troubled History ofAmerica\'s Universities. Enslaved people not only
labored in and for American universities; their very bodies doubled as
the literal capital for building and sustaining them-a foundation
partially excavated by the 2015 actions of #GU272 at Georgetown
University. In The Imperial University: Academic Repression and
Scholarly Dissent, Piya Chatterjee and Sunaina Maira bring together a
collection of voices that detail the imbrication of military and
academic complexes, of imperial hegemony and academic repression.
Scyborgs practice Black study, strategize and find breath in the
undercommons-a fugitive reorganization of the university that Stefano
Harney and Fred Moten lyrically describe in The Undercommons: Fugitive
Planning and Black Study.

### 1NC---Alt---Ethic of Incommensurability

#### The alt is to recognize that decol is [NOT]{.underline} a metaphor and reconciliation of settlers [does not]{.underline} solve. Rather, adopting an [ethic of incommensurability]{.underline} is the only way to successfully decolonize.

Eve **Tuck and** K. Wayne **Yang**, 9/8/20**12** \[Eve Tuck is James
Weldon Johnson Professor of Indigenous Studies at Steinhardt and

[[An ethic of incommensurability]{.underline}]{.mark}, which guides
moves that unsettle innocence, [[stands in contrast to]{.mark} aims of
[reconciliation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which motivate settler moves to
innocence.]{.underline} Reconciliation is about rescuing settler
normalcy, about rescuing a settler future. [[Reconciliation]{.mark} is
concerned with [questions]{.mark} of [what will decol]{.mark}onization
[look like?]{.mark} [What]{.mark} will [happen]{.mark} after
[abolition]{.mark}? [What will be the consequences]{.mark} [of
decol]{.mark}onization [for the settler]{.mark}?
[Incommensurability]{.mark} [acknowledges]{.mark} that **[these
questions need not]{.mark},** and perhaps cannot, **[be
answered]{.mark}** in order **[for]{.mark} [decol]{.mark}**onization
**[to exist]{.mark}** as a framework]{.underline}. We want to say,
first, [that decolonization is not obliged to answer those
questions]{.underline} - [decolonization is **not accountable to
settlers**, or settler futurity]{.underline}.
[[**Decol**onization]{.mark} **[is accountable to Indigenous sovereignty
and futurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Still, we acknowledge the questions
of those wary participants in Occupy Oakland and other settlers who want
to know what decolonization will require of them. [[**The** **answers
are not fully in view and can't be as long as decolonization remains
punctuated by metaphor**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The answers will not
emerge from friendly understanding, and indeed require a dangerous
understanding of uncommonality that un-coalesces coalition politics -
moves that may feel very unfriendly. But we will find out the answers as
we get there, "in the exact measure that we can discern the movements
which give \[decolonization\] historical form and content" (Fanon, 1963,
p. 36). [**[To]{.mark}** fully [**enact an ethic of incommensurability
means** relinquishing settler futurity]{.mark}, abandoning the hope that
settlers may one day be commensurable to Native peoples.]{.underline}
[It [means **remov**ing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the asterisks, periods,
commas, apostrophes, the whereas's, buts, and **[conditional clauses
that]{.mark} punctuate decolonization and [underwrite settler
innocence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Native futures, the lives to be
lived once the settler nation is gone - these are the unwritten
possibilities made possible by an ethic of
incommensurability]{.underline}. When you take away the punctuation he
says of lines lifted from the documents about military-occupied land its
acreage and location you take away its finality opening the possibility
of other futures -Craig Santos Perez, Chamoru scholar and poet (as
quoted by Voeltz, 2012). Decolonization offers a different perspective
to human and civil rights based approaches to justice, an unsettling
one, rather than a complementary one. **[[Decolonization is not an
"and". It is an elsewhere.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 1NC---Alt---Give Back the Land

#### The Only Alternative Is To Give Land Back to Indigenous Nations

**Guenther 23**, Canadian philosopher and activist, known for her work
on solitary confinement, prison torture, reproductive injustice, and the
carceral state. (Lisa Guenther, 2023, #AbolishCanada: Breaking Down the
2022 Freedom Convoy, The South Atlantic Quarterly, vol. 122, no. 3,
<http://read.dukeupress.edu/south-atlantic-quarterly/article-pdf/122/3/651/1998091/651guenther.pdf>,
p. 653-654) // SMil

On one hand, [it [makes]{.mark} [no]{.mark} [sense]{.mark} from a
decolonial abolitionist perspective [to call for the police]{.mark} of a
settler state [to crack down on]{.mark} unruly s[ettlers]{.mark} for the
sake of restoring peace, order, and good government on stolen Indigenous
land.]{.underline} [[This is]{.mark} precisely **the tag-team [operation
that sustain]{.mark}s [settler]{.mark} [colonial logic]{.mark}s:** the
state upholds "the rule of law" while settlers push the boundaries of
legal occupation on the ground.]{.underline} In the end, [**both sides
of the settler equation benefit** from the way internal squabbles
naturalize the settler occupation of Indigenous land as "our
streets]{.underline}."

[[On]{.mark} the [other hand]{.mark}, it [isn't clear how to
organize]{.mark} [effective]{.mark} grassroots [resistance]{.mark}
[against]{.mark} a well-funded [group]{.mark} [of]{.mark} possibly
[armed]{.mark} right-wing [protesters]{.mark}]{.underline} in large
vehicles who decide to occupy a small, liberal city in the middle of
winter, and very quickly set up a military-style supply chain of fuel,
food, and entertainment to keep them going, thanks in large part to a
friendly response from local police (at least in the first few weeks).
[And [even when people do take matters into their own hands]{.mark}, as
in the Battle of Billings Bridge, where Ottawa residents came together
in --22 °C weather to confront convoy weekenders on the ground, the
[problem]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[whose]{.mark}
[streets]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [[does not]{.mark} magically
[dissolve]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Whether you rely on the police or not[, the fact remains that the city
of [Ottawa]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [built]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[unceded]{.mark} [Algonquin Anishinaabe territory]{.mark}.]{.underline}
And so[, [even]{.mark} [if]{.mark} grassroots [efforts]{.mark}
[were]{.mark} [successful]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [ousting]{.mark} the
[settlers]{.mark}]{.underline} who illegally occu- pied the city of
Ottawa for three weeks, [the [settlers]{.mark} [who]{.mark}
**[have]{.mark} [illegally]{.mark} [occupied]{.mark}** these
[Indigenous]{.mark} [lands]{.mark} for over **three hundred years**
[would]{.mark} still **[remain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This dilemma
recalls the "**[[ethic of incommensurability]{.mark}"]{.underline}**
[[between]{.mark} [abolition]{.mark} and [decolonization]{.mark} that
Tuck and Yang identify as both a problem and a possibility for radical
politics]{.underline} (2012: 29--36[). [Every prison, jail, and
detention center could be shut down in]{.mark} so-called
[Canada]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [country]{.mark} [would]{.mark} still
[remain]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [settler colony]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a
patchwork of [unceded]{.mark}, purchased, and treaty [land]{.mark}.
Every police force could be defunded and abolished, and settlers could
still informally police Indigenous peoples and extract wealth from
Indigenous lands.]{.underline}

But this is precisely the lesson of the Ottawa occupation: **[[there can
be no meaningful abolition without decolonization and Indigenous
resurgence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This does not necessarily mean that
every settler leaves Turtle Island, although it]{.underline} **[does not
rule it out]{.underline}**. Either way, [[**abolitionist movements must
go beyond** dismantlin]{.mark}g]{.underline} [carceral]{.underline}
[[institutions,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} even beyond **dismantling the
[state]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [We must also care for the land upon
which prisons and pipelines, but also community gardens and yoga
studios, are constructed]{.underline}.

As Robyn Maynard argues, "One opposite of policing is **[Land
Back]{.underline}**, which is, after all, [an end to the imposition of
private property regimes and the carceral technologies developed to
enforce them]{.underline}" (Maynard and Simpson 2022: 204). Before
colonial invasion, [Indigenous peoples on what the Algon- quin and
Haudenosaunee call Turtle Island kept each other safe and held each
other accountable without prisons or police.]{.underline} This means
[that [a]{.mark} [world]{.mark} [without]{.mark} [prisons]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} **[not]{.mark} [just]{.mark} a [utopian]{.mark}** future to
be imagined here, [but]{.mark} a **[plural]{.mark}ity of
[practices]{.mark} and legal orders**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark}
[be]{.mark} remembered and [reimagined]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[White
settlers]{.underline}** like myself are not keepers of these memories[,
[but]{.mark} we can [play]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [role]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[helping]{.mark} the [colonial]{.mark}-carceral [world]{.mark} to
[die]{.mark} so that other, more life-giving worlds may
flourish]{.underline} (Oliveira 2021). Part of this process involves
un-learning the history of the death-dealing world we have inherited and
continue to inhabit.

Learning from the Beaver

In her 2020 lecture, "A Short History of the Blockade,"
**[[Michi]{.mark} [Saagiig]{.mark} [Nishnaabeg]{.mark} [writer]{.mark}
Leanne Betasamosake [Simpson]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[reflects]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the [world]{.mark}-[building]{.mark} [power]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark} blockades [against]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**"the [colonial]{.mark} [machinery]{.mark} of elimina- tion**,"
[which]{.mark} [includes]{.mark} [everything]{.mark} from
[police]{.mark} and [prisons]{.mark} to [universities]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [museums]{.mark}]{.underline} (2021: 4) Writing in support
of the Wet'suwet'en people's refusal of a gas pipeline on their unceded
land and the many solidarity actions that #ShutDownCanada for three
weeks in February 2020, Simpson calls blockades "[both]{.mark} a refusal
and an affirmation. [[An affirmation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [different
political economy]{.mark}. A world [built]{.mark} [upon]{.mark} a
different set of **relationships and [ethics]{.mark}**. **An affirmation
of life"**]{.underline} (56)

[The Freedom Convoy demonstrated loud and clear that the tactic of the
blockade could be appropriated for settler world-building projects.also
challenges us as decolonial abolitionists to reclaim the tactic of
genera- tive refusal, following the teachings of the
beaver,]{.underline} or Amik, who builds "dams that create deep pools
and [channels that don't freeze, creating winter worlds" [that]{.mark}
[sustain]{.mark} multiple forms of [life rather than
securitizing]{.mark} its own [self]{.mark}- enclosed domain]{.underline}
(14). Simpson asks: And wh[o is the first back after a fire to start the
regeneration makework]{.underline}? Amik is **[a world
builder]{.underline}**. Amik is **[the one that brings the
water]{.underline}**. Amik is **[the one that [brings forth more
lif]{.mark}e]{.underline}**. Amik is **[the one that [works continuously
with water]{.mark} and [land]{.mark} and [plant]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[animal]{.mark} [nations]{.mark} and [consent]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[diplomacy]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [create]{.mark} [worlds]{.mark}, to
create shared worlds]{.underline}**. (15)

[Simpson [contrasts the life-giving infrastructure]{.mark} [of a beaver
dam]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the critical (read: colonial capitalist)
[infrastructure of]{.mark} the [T]{.mark}rent [S]{.mark}evern
[W]{.mark}aterway, which channels waters between Chi-Nibish (Lake
Ontario) and Odawa Wiik- wwedong (Georgian Bay) into a canal system to
support industrial develop- ment. While [the]{.mark} [T]{.mark}rent
[S]{.mark}evern [W]{.mark}aterway [is]{.mark} a simple negation,
"[an]{.mark} [ending]{.mark} [of life]{.mark}"]{.underline} (32),
[[the]{.mark} beaver [dam is]{.mark} "both a [negation and]{.mark} an
[affirmation]{.mark}"]{.underline} (20).

This is not to say that Amik is incapable of doing wrong or harming oth-
ers, whether by accident or on purpose. Simpson shares a story of the
Giant Beaver who once roamed the earth, wrecking havoc for Nokomis and
their grandchild Nanabush. Giant Amik builds a giant dam that raises the
water levels between Gichi Gaming (Lake Superior) and Odawa Gaming (Lake
Huron). In Simpson's version of the story, Nokomis and Nanabush hack
into Amik's social media accounts and start deleting their posts until
Amik comes crashing into their encampment between the lakes. A fight
ensues for two days and nights, and in the end Amik bursts through their
own dam to escape, releasing the water and creating thirty thousand
islands with the wreckage of the dam (Simpson 2021: 21--3). [And so, a
giant dam that once threatened to destroy a campsite creates thirty
thousand new dwelling places for two-legged and four-legged creatures
**through its generative destruction**.]{.underline} After the battle,
Giant Beaver runs off to the ocean, but Nanabush calls them back and
invites them to what we might now call a **[community accountability
process.]{.underline}** Eventually, they learn "to use their beaver
skills for good," thanks to "a little patience, a little resistance,
some community, and a considerable reduction in size to the Amik we know
and love today" (23).

This story of the Giant Beaver reminds us that [[a world without prisons
or police is not a world where nothing harmful can happen]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} rather [a place where harm, accountability, and repair
are]{.mark} all [part]{.mark} of a process [of]{.mark} [learning how to
share]{.mark} the [earth and]{.mark} build [worlds with
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[destructive]{.mark}
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} of Giant Amik [[are]{.mark}
[neither]{.mark} [tolerated]{.mark} [nor demonized]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}
rather [scaled down]{.mark} to the point where they may support life
rather than undermining it.]{.underline}

[This is not to say that the Freedom Convoy or the tar sands of Fort
McMurray could become life-giving if they were scaled down]{.underline}
and befriended by a twenty-first-century Nanabush[. [Some **projects are
just incommensurable with decolonial abolition**---with life
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. Simpson's story doesn't tell us whether or
not to call the cops on big rig blockaders, although she does "give
thanks to Nokomis and Nanabush for not arresting Giant Beaver,
destroying the blockade, and going back to business as usual" (32). A
part of me also wonders what might happen if Giant Beaver kept their
size but used their mighty tail to bust up pipelines and convoys with
their new friends.

[[If we understand Canada as]{.mark} both a liberal democracy committed
to the rule of law and---precisely as such---[a "criminal
empire]{.mark}" (Stark 2016) willing to destroy the earth along with the
Indigenous nations who care for it, [then]{.mark} Robyn Maynard is
right: **[Abolition means Land Back]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[The
question]{.mark} for decolonial abolitionists [then becomes]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} [just]{.mark} [how to shut down thi]{.mark}s particular
[institution]{.mark} or dislodge that annoying right-wing occupation,
[but]{.mark} rather]{.underline} **[[how to work together to
stanch]{.mark} the [flows of colonial racial]{.mark}
[capitalism,]{.mark} deepening pools that support diverse forms of life
and busting up blockages of accumulated wealth [to create islands of
refuge for sharing the earth.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Block---AT: Reconciliation

#### Reconciliation fails -- international policy still rejects indigenous sovereignty and makes no difference.

[**The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**
[**(UNDRIP)** forms another important pillar of
Reconciliation]{.mark}TM. [UNDRIP is the result of decades]{.mark} [of
Indigenous activism]{.mark} around the world]{.underline} (Morgan,
2011), and a great many scholars, advocates and activists are working to
imbue it with transformative potential (e.g. CIGI, 2017). [However,
[**settler states** like Canada and Australia worked to undermine
the]{.mark} original [draft]{.mark}, and in particular, [to insert
language reaffirming state sovereignty and positioning Indigenous rights
as internal to and compatible with that sover-
eignty]{.mark}]{.underline} (Forester, 2024).\
[Thus, **[UNDRIP]{.mark}** accepts and [legitimizes the]{.mark} basic
[proposition of]{.mark} **settler colonial**- ism- [**settlers have
sovereignty and Indigenous peoples do not.**]{.mark}]{.underline} What
UNDRIP does is codify a series of voluntary commitments by settler
sovereigns about how they will treat their Indigenous subjects. Like
Aboriginal rights and the modern treaty pro- cess, [**[UNDRIP]{.mark}**
does two things---it offers rights, and if [affirms **settler
sovereignty**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}\
[Indeed, [commentators]{.mark} frequently [worry that **UNDRIP** could
be read as creating an Indigenous 'veto' over resource extraction
projects]{.mark}---]{.underline}in other words[, [that it may per- mit
expressions]{.underline}]{.mark} [of Indigenous agency [that are not
compatible with Crown sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**Settler**
governments]{.underline}, both through their words and their actions[,
have been quick to assure that **UNDRIP** creates no such
powers]{.underline} and is essentially consistent with the existing
jurisprudence on aboriginal rights, and especially with the government's
sov- ereign ability to infringe UNDRIP rights in pursuit of public
policy (Diabo, 2020).\
Interview participants were predictably unimpressed with the concrete
results: ['**[UNDRIP]{.mark}** theoretically is brilliant and amazing,
however, practically it [makes zero]{.mark} ~~fucking~~
[difference]{.mark}', one Indigenous participant concludes]{.underline}

#### Reconciliation is a tool for white fragility and settler innocence -- reconciliation politics reject coloniality as a contemporary reality or treats reconciliation as a solvent action.

Moreover, some aspects of the TRC work to subtly legitimize crown
sovereignty. For example, the TRC approaches its vision of
reconciliation in a 'victim centered' manner. This approach has some
benefits (James, 2021), however[, one effect is to position Indigenous
bodies, rather than colonial institutions, as the primary site of
repair]{.underline} (Coulthard, 2014; A Simpson, 2016; see also
Madlingozi, 2010). [Indigenous bodies are pathologized as broken,
traumatized, victims in need of state care (Million, 2013), while the
**settler state is positioned** 'not as the source of injustice but **as
the agent of nonrepetition and redemption'**]{.underline} (James, 2021,
p. 184). This aspect of the TRC's approach works to shore up the
legitimacy of the state as a much needed protector and healer of
Indigenous peoples. ['\[[**Reconciliation** is]{.mark}\] [for **white
fragility**]{.mark}. It's for people who are ridden with guilt knowing
they have accumulated mass privilege and wealth and power off stolen
lands\... [It's]{.mark} actually [about them feeling good about
themselves]{.mark}',]{.underline} an Indigenous participant concludes
(Participant 8, interview, 2021). As a **[settler]{.underline}**
participant puts it 'even when \[[**[the settler state]{.mark}**\] [does
protect it only]{.mark} does so [in ways that]{.mark} generally
[solidify and support colonialism']{.mark}]{.underline} (Participant 10,
inter- view, 2021).

**[Reconciliation politics]{.underline}**

ReconciliationTM has also become a touchstone in Canadian electoral
politics. Snelgrove (2021) helpfully identifies two political functions
that reconciliation has played (2021). [[Under the Conservative Harper
government]{.mark}, reconciliation worked to 'ideologically manufacture'
a break between the colonial past and postcolonial present in which the
state has renounced colonial injustices]{.underline} (Coulthard, 2014
Chap- ter 4). [By presenting [colonialization as a historic injustice
rather than a contempo- rary reality]{.mark}, this ideological break
[suggests that today's task is not to decolonize]{.mark} cur- rent
institutions and power structures, but rather to address the lingering
harms of a colonial past.]{.underline} [Under Liberal Prime Minister
Trudeau, the work of reconciliation has shifted.]{.mark} [Now that
colonization has been positioned as a historical injustice, [Trudeau is
able to portray the present as the era of reconciliation]{.mark}, and
thus to deploy the term [to actively legitimize present power
relations]{.mark} and forestall calls for change. 'If reconciliation
under Harper was about effecting a closure between past and present,
under Trudeau it is more about effecting a closure between our present
and alterna- tive futures', Snelgrove argues (2021, p. 59).]{.underline}

Indeed, [[**challenges to the settler state** become challenges to
reconciliation itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. Olschewski (2020) argues
that Trudeau consistently positions his government as willing to use its
powers to treat Indigenous peoples more fairly than past govern- ments
(ideological break), and therefore calls on Indigenous people to resolve
their concerns within **[settler institutions]{.underline}** (closing
alternative futures). Trudeau presents those involved in the 'Shut Down
Canada' actions as spurning [the government's good-faith efforts at
reconciliation (Olschewski, 2020). [This rhetoric 'creates a vic-
tim-victimizer reversal']{.mark} [where the government is a]{.mark}
willing [partner in reconciliation, but]{.mark} where [activists make
reconciliation impossible by challenging]{.mark} the very [institu-
tions that are offering amends]{.mark}]{.underline} (Olschewski, 2020,
p. 34).

[Just as in the courts, the political deployment of reconciliation
suggests that Indigenous needs can be met only to the degree that they
are compatible with the ongoing sovereignty of the settler
state.]{.underline}

#### Settler colonialism reform is a [trick of time]{.underline} -- concepts like "[evolution]{.underline}" and "[reconciliation]{.underline}" work as a cohort to [maintain settler domination]{.underline} by shifting its [appearance]{.underline}.

developments, Anishinaabe theorist Leanne Simpson articulates how the
particulars of settler colonial practices have changed not necessarily
in spite of their dominance but to maintain it: ["\[[S\]ettler

certain particulars of colonialism can change without fundamentally
altering the totality itself. Simpson registers how [[this]{.mark} twin
[dynamic of **continuity and change occurs through rather than against
experience**]{.mark}: "[I]{.mark} certainly do not experience \[settler
colonialism\] as a historical incident that has unfortunate consequences
for the present. I [experience it as]{.mark} a gendered structure and [a
series of complex and overlapping processes that work together as a
cohort to maintain the structure]{.mark}]{.underline}" (47). Already,
Simpson's references to structure invoke our distinction with totality:
she [regards settler colonialism as being ordered in gendered,
capitalist, and anti-democratic ways. It is, then, no longer simply a
structure but an instance of the totality's social order.]{.underline}

### Block---AT: Land Not Key

#### Land is key to decolonization. **McDonnell**\* **& Regenvanu**\*\* **22**, \*Associate Professor at the Crawford School of Public Policy at The Australian National University. \*\*Vanuatu\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation & External Trade. (Siobhan McDonnell & Ralph Regenvanu, Decolonization as practice: returning land to Indigenous control," AlterNative, vol. 18, no. 2, p. 235-236 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361826775_Decolonization_as_practice_returning_land_to_Indigenous_control)

[[Land is sovereignty. Without Indigenous people holding their land
there is no pathway to decolonization.]{.underline}]{.mark} Vanuatu
gained independence in 1980 after being colonized by the English and
French and held under a joint condominium arrangement. Indigenous people
in Vanuatu are called ni-Vanuatu, but many have specific language[,
island or place-based affiliations that they more closely identify with,
beyond their national identity.]{.underline}

In Vanuatu, independence was fought partly on the basis of returning
large tracts of alienated land to Indigenous control. Shortly after
independence, the first Minister for Land, Sethy Regenvanu, famously
stated,

For ni-Vanuatu \[as written in original work\], [[land is more than
simply a commodity to be used for gain and to be disposed of when it has
been stripped of its value**. Land is an intrinsic part of themselves
and their whole being**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Land to ni-Vanuatu \[as
written in original work\] is what a mother is to a baby[. It is with
[land that he defines his identity and it is with land that he maintains
his spiritual strength.]{.mark}]{.underline} (S. Regenvanu, 1980, p. 67)

[Here, ni-Vanuatu relationships to land are contrasted with Western
concepts of **land as a commodity for use and transfer**.]{.underline}
Sethy [Regenvanu describes these [relationships to land as reciprocal;
as an intrinsic deeply maternal, embedded, spiritual connection to place
that defines identity.]{.mark} Within Indigenous knowledge systems l[and
is the basis for knowing yourself as well as understanding the material
and spiritual world. Land is the mother**.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[Land,]{.underline}** in this article, [is used as a shorthand for the
entire terrestrial and marine environment]{.underline}. [But this is not
simply a reference to the physical, material landscape; it is also our
way of describing the relational web of ecological, spiritual and social
relationships attached to land.]{.underline} The brilliant Kanaka Maoli
(Indigenous Hawaiian) activist and scholar the late Haunani Kay Trask
(1949--2021) [reminds us of [the inseparability of Indigenous bodily
sovereignty, from sovereignty over land and
waters]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} She writes,

Our story remains unwritten. [It rests within [the culture, which is
inseparable from the land.]{.mark} To know this is to know our history.
To write this is to write of the land and the people who are born from
her.]{.underline} (Trask, 1999, p. 121)

[[Land is the repository of storied ways of knowing and being in the
world. It is history, and it is culture.]{.mark} It is the conduit for
the relational connections between people. **[People are born to the
land.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The idea of land as the mother, so central to Indigenous conceptions of
place and belonging, also exists in Indigenous Australia. Yuin Nation
author Bruce Pascoe writes,

One of the most fundamental differences between Aboriginal and
non-Aboriginal people is the understanding of the relationship between
people and the land.

Earth is the mother. Aboriginal people are born of the earth, and
individuals within the clan had responsibilities for particular steams,
grassland, trees, crops, animals and even seasons. (Pascoe, 2014, p.
209)

Elsewhere Pascoe details the gendered landscape of the sacred Gulaga
Mountain. He writes of the massive rock formation---pregnant Nyaardi,
who later carries a child on her back---describing how Yuin men say, "We
all arise from the Mother. That is the lore" (Pascoe, 2014, p. 188).
Here Pascoe details the profoundly irreconcilable epistemological
understandings of the idea of land embedded in Indigenous framings
compared with those structured by property relations.

**[[Land is essential to ensuring sovereign futures for Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For Indigenous people in Oceania and
elsewhere, securing adequate [access to land is central to adapting to
the complex challenges caused by climate change impacts. [Access to land
is central to ensuring the food security]{.mark} of current and future
generations; [to managing]{.mark} environmental issues and problems of
[environmental degradation;]{.mark} to [ensuring the maintenance of
complex Indigenous knowledge systems; to addressing the complex problems
of relocation and resettlement; to providing options in relation to
disaster]{.mark} responses and management[; to addressing housing needs;
to creating future development and infrastructure projects; and to
ensuring cultural and language continuity]{.mark}. Land is often
[central to understanding issues of conflict and resource]{.mark}
extraction, functioning as a [driver of both politics and the political
economies of various states.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Having discussed the multiple meanings of land, we also begin this
article by acknowledging that the word [[Indigenous is a colonial
construct and that use of this term necessarily involves the
generalization across what are diverse cultural and language
groups]{.mark},]{.underline} and even more diverse experiences.
Similarly, we have reservations about the use of ni-Vanuatu to describe
the diverse 100 language and cultural groups found across the
archipelago of Vanuatu. However, we are also aware that the term
Indigenous is one that is attached to an important global rights
movement for Indigenous rights, as reflected in the United Nations
Declaration of Rights for Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) (United Nations
Assembly, 2007). Throughout this article, we use the term Indigenous to
both celebrate these gains, and in an effort to engage in
transIndigenous scholarship that shows, following Chadwick Allen,
"different kinds of conversations" acknowledging the mobility of
Indigenous people, ideas and texts across what is now known as
Australia, Aotearoa, Oceania, Turtle Island, Canada and beyond (Allen,
2012, p. xiv).

# Settler Colonialism---Aff

### 2AC---Influence DA

#### Influence DA\-\--the alt is the functional dismantling of the US, which triggers escalation, collapses deterrence, and causes trade wars 

**Teichert 24**, United States Air Force Brigadier General (John
Teichert, 11/4/2024, "US absence in the world is as dangerous as US
weakness," Atlantic Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/us-absence-in-the-world-is-as-dangerous-as-us-weakness/)

Many lament [the erosion of US strength abroad over the past
three-and-a-half years]{.underline}. During the Biden administration,
[the world has become a more dangerous place, with the eruption of major
wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East and a resurgence of
emboldened Chinese aggression in the Western Pacific]{.underline}. Many
American conservatives rightly point to the feckless US withdrawal from
Afghanistan in 2021 as a precedent that has enticed aggressors and
inflamed malign activity around the planet.

At the same time, US national security policies have been constrained by
President Joe Biden's excessive concerns that demonstrations of US
strength will lead to escalation. In reality, [US **weakness has driven
escalatory cycles** that have been profoundly harmful to US interests in
recent years. As it turns out, strength checks aggression while weakness
entices it]{.underline}---a lesson that great leaders are quick to
embrace.

Some on the conservative side of the political spectrum have bemoaned
this weakness while at the same time eagerly trumpeting their
isolationist impulses. Yet on the world stage, there are [many
similarities between a weak United States and]{.underline} **[an absent
United States]{.underline}**. Both foster an international environment
that is harmful to US interests, objectives, and priorities. Thus, it is
time for conservatives to reconsider their national security positions
to avoid producing the same disastrous results that have been evident
during the current administration. [Weakness and absence are strategic
cousins that degrade deterrence and make adversary aggression much more
likely.]{.underline}

**[Deterrence]{.underline}** [relies on an adversary's perception of the
situation]{.underline}. Following the proper application of deterrence
theory, leaders and policymakers seek to diminish the perceived benefits
in the mind of an adversary of engaging in an unwanted activity, while
increasing the perceived risks and costs of that activity. At the same
time, [the adversary is asking two questions: Does the United States
have the capability to respond? And does it have the will to do
so?]{.underline}

In the current national security environment, hostile actors generally
believe in the enduring US strength of capability. They know that the
United States has overwhelming global military might. Yet, these hostile
actors likely sense a profound weakness in Americans' will to stand up
for US interests, objectives, and priorities. Such perceptions about
diminished will are reinforced by every presidential comment and report
about Biden's fears of escalation. As deterrence has diminished,
aggressors have taken steps in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the
Western Pacific that have benefited from a White House that is hesitant
to act.

[Just as weakness has eroded deterrence, **so too would an absent United
States**]{.underline}, driven by isolationist impulses. A professed
[isolationism would provide a **clear signal** to an adversary that the
United States **lacks the will to engage in the global
environment**]{.underline}. Yet, isolationism has compounding effects on
deterrence because [US absence **removes the proximity of its strength
of capability**. If the US military retreats from a robust global
posture, its capability will not be available in the right quantity and
adequate concentration to stop aggression]{.underline}. Thus, in the
mind of an adversary, an isolationist US posture is characterized by a
weakness in both capability and will---a dire situation for any strategy
that relies on deterrence to prevent aggression. Such a retreat would
diminish the United States' ability to maintain a world order that is
beneficial to its interests.

It is important to understand the major benefits that the United States
enjoys from an international environment that is free, open, prosperous,
and secure, even if just from a high-level economic perspective. More
than a quarter of US gross domestic product (GDP) comes from
international commerce. Additionally, the massive increase in global
trade and investment since World War II has skyrocketed global GDP, and
the United States has disproportionately benefited from this impressive
increase. Whether the United States likes it or not, its well-being is
inextricably tied to a global system that it helped create.

Yet, when that global trade faces barriers, prompted by US weakness, the
impacts are immediate and harmful to US interests. The current situation
in the Red Sea is instructive.

Houthi rockets, missiles, and drones started to target maritime activity
in the Red Sea several weeks after Hamas's barbaric attack on Israel on
October 7, 2023. Almost immediately, shipping costs from Asia to the
East Coast of the United States increased by 55 percent. This spike has
stabilized to more than triple the cost since the onset of Houthi
activity, a massive inflationary input into a US economy at a time when
Americans are already facing severe struggles with price increases. [The
inability or unwillingness of the US-led international order to preserve
safe transit in this region has directly led to substantial internal
price increases]{.underline}. Additionally, [the world has suffered from
a global inflationary rise of an additional 0.5 to 0.7 percent, as well
as a loss of global domestic product of about 0.4 percent as a result of
these disruptions.]{.underline} US weakness in this geographic area has
ceded territory and initiative to a ragtag group of militants, while
passing along economic harm to the US and global population.

[This outsize impact has resulted from constraints on a maritime
thoroughfare that provides passage for 15 percent of global
trade]{.underline}. The implications [**of a similar shutdown in the
Western Pacific**, much more easily enforced by a world power far more
potent than the Houthis, **would be substantially worse**]{.underline}.

Around 60 percent of maritime trade transits through Asian waters, and a
third of global shipping passes through the South China Sea. And this
isn't just any trade, but vitally important trade. Taiwan and South
Korea control a critical share of the world's production of advanced
processors, both sitting just off the coast of a resurgent China that
strives to disrupt the global order in ways that are advantageous to its
own interests. China is hungry for high-end semiconductors, spending
more money on importing chips than it does on importing oil. The
ramifications of either US weakness or absence, both of which would
drastically diminish freedom of transit in this part of the world, would
prove devastating to the quality of life of many Americans, who have
come to rely on a world order that they have carefully created and
maintained through a combination of strength of capability and will.

None of this is to say that the United States should disproportionately
bear the burden of global security when its allies and partners are
similarly reliant on such a system. A broad and trusting network of
allies and partners is a US advantage that must be carefully cultivated,
applied, balanced, and optimized. Yet, geopolitical demands, axioms, and
examples must remind US policymakers and national security experts that
if deterrence still matters, then it is best established by strength of
both capability and will.

[US **absence** or weakness---flip sides of the same disastrous
geostrategic coin---are so similar in **their ruinous outcomes** that
**they must both be avoided** by national security practitioners on both
sides of the aisle]{.underline}. To lament weakness while supporting
absence is to hypocritically stumble into the same strategic quagmire
that conservatives have bemoaned all along.

### 2AC---Institutions DA

#### Institutions DA\-\--Decolonization movements will quickly be decapitated by institutions -- instances like South African decolonization activism proves failure.

// LT

[[What was lost in]{.mark} those heady days of [**decolonial activism**
was an opportunity to grapple seriously and deeply with what continues
to be elided]{.mark} -- [how to navigate around the institutional
barriers to radical curriculum change.]{.mark}]{.underline} [One thing
that stood out from our study is that [the **decolonisation** moment
completely underestimated the power of institutions to neuter radical
ideas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Three examples illustrate this problem. To
begin with, the socialisation of academics is embedded in mainstream
science, its content and training, its incentives and rewards. [[To ask
academics to radically change their understandings of the discipline is
something most cannot do]{.mark} and not a few will not do. To demand
that a professor of nanotechnology or immunology 'decolonise' their
discipline is to be met, most times, with bewilderment at
best.]{.underline} Which raises the question: how do you change a
curriculum without changing the curriculum makers? The short answer is,
with great difficulty and with considerable patience on the part of
those making the demands[. A second set of problems that did not enjoy
much deliberation concerns the question of academic
autonomy.]{.underline} In South Africa, academics enjoy significant
autonomy in decisions around what to teach and how to teach it.
[[Broader questions of institutional autonomy were an important arena of
struggle]{.mark} against the encroachment of the apartheid state on
everything from non-racial student admissions to staffing appointments.
That tradition remains strongly entrenched in the country\'s public
universities.]{.underline} The pressing demand that academics decolonise
their curricula was a non-starter from the outset even when some
institutions foolishly linked such instruction to the performance
appraisals of individual staff members. A third very formidable problem
for decolonisation is the authority of the regulatory system over the
kinds of knowledge deemed worthy of accreditation. Our research focused
on three powerful accreditation authorities in accounting, engineering
and medicine and found that there was some anxiety at the height of the
decolonisation protests about what this would mean for essential
knowledge in these professional disciplines[. Authorities were clear
that there was to be no deviation from what the regulators had set in
place in conjunction with international moderating bodies. They need not
have worried for even in the mainstream regulatory processes for new
qualifications, [an enterprising professor determined to introduce a new
curriculum could wait for three to five years before official
recognition is granted for the approval]{.mark}, registration and
funding of a new qualification (Jansen and Walters]{.underline}
Reference Jansen and Walters2022). [[Those are not the kinds of
timelines that accord with the demands for **radical change**]{.mark}
with respect to legacy knowledge as demanded by the decolonisation
activists.]{.underline}

### 2AC---Reconciliation \> Decolonization

#### Reconciliation is possible\-\--State can materially decolonize/give land back

**Smith 21**, assistant editor for High Country News. (Anna Smith,
1/26/2021, "Reclaiming the National Bison Range," High Country News,
https://www.hcn.org/issues/53-2/indigenous-affairs-tribes-reclaiming-the-national-bison-range/)

When Shane Morigeau was growing up [on the Flathead Indian Reservation,
he knew that the land inside the fenced National Bison Range was
different from the tribal lands elsewhere]{.underline} on the
reservation, at the base of Montana's Mission Mountains or the shores of
Flathead Lake. He remembers being a kid in his dad's truck, driving past
while his father explained that the lands inside the fence weren't
tribal lands anymore. As tribal elders tell it, it was common knowledge
that the fence was as much to keep them out as it was to keep bison in.
"It happened long ago," Morigeau said, but "it still resonates across
generations.

In December, [a bipartisan bill that would transfer the lands and
management of the National Bison Range to the Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes]{.underline} looked as if it might die in Congress with
the end of the session. Instead, it [was attached to a must-pass package
of COVID-19 relief and government spending bills, and, unexpectedly, it
passed]{.underline}. After a century of work, it felt sudden, said
Morigeau, a tribal member and attorney for the Confederated Salish and
Kootenai Tribes and a Montana state legislator. "It happened so fast, it
just really hasn't sunk in."

Finally, [after 113 years, the 18,800 acres of grassland, woodland and
wildlife that comprise the National Bison Range, along with its resident
bison herd, will be returned to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai
Tribes]{.underline}. Today, [the transfer has **broad support** from the
community, conservation groups and politicians alike]{.underline}. [But
the long journey included three rounds of failed agreements between the
U.S. and the tribe, numerous lawsuits, a federal investigation, and a
massive public education campaign]{.underline} [to quash racist rumors
and stereotypes]{.underline}. It comes at a time of a broader
conversation on the return of land stewardship to tribal nations, with
an Indigenous woman --- Deb Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) --- poised to
oversee public-lands management as Interior secretary for the first time
in history.

"**[It's a reconciliation]{.underline}**," [said Chairwoman Shelly
Fyant]{.underline}. "We are such a place-based people. [To have this
land back, to be in control of it, is a fresh, new hope]{.underline}."

#### Reconciliation via land transfer is possible and valuable, even if imperfect

**Glendenning et al 23,** Audrey Glendenning (Bolle Center for People
and Forests), Martin Nie (University of Montana), Prof. Monte Mills
(Native American Law Center, Univ. of Washington School of Law) (2023,

250-252
https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4142&context=nrj)

As these examples show, [**the transfer of public lands** for the
benefit of Native Nations can be a **meaningful step toward reckoning
with and reconciling** the darker history of our nation's public
lands.]{.underline} Each of the examples also demonstrates, however,
that these [modern-day efforts to address that history have been
complicated by the intervening decades of federal ownership of those
lands, which has resulted in the establishment of a complex web of
interests and expectations that come to bear on the politics of transfer
legislation.]{.underline} For example, most of the laws transferring
federal public lands to tribal trust status come with provisions
regarding how lands must be managed in the future. Further, the transfer
of these lands into trust status for the benefit of a tribe invokes the
more general laws and regulations pertaining to the management of Indian
trust lands and assets. There are, in other words, strings most often
attached.

While [some people may encourage this approach]{.underline}, othe[rs may
view it as perpetuating a flawed trust management paradigm and
undermining or limiting the inherent sovereignty of tribal
nations]{.underline}. Still, [others may **take a more middle ground**,
viewing the approach as a reasonable compromise in a complicated
world]{.underline}, [and that while the trust relationship is
problematic, it is also an important principle of federal Indian law and
one that **can be used to promote tribal sovereignty and
selfdetermination.**]{.underline} Indeed, [the tribal **governments who
advocated for the passage** of these laws and effectuated the transfer
of these lands would likely **view their actions as a meaningful
exercise of their sovereign powers** and representative of the federal
government's sacred trust obligations]{.underline}. Because each of
these transfers has focused only on specific parcels and individual
situations, the consideration of these positions on a more general (and
national) scale has yet to occur.

[No one has discerned a definitive script to decolonizing a settler
polity]{.underline}.278 [The most straightforward solution might be the
one that historian Lorenzo Veracini also finds **unrealistic and
infeasible**, which is **that settlers must leave** the conquered
territory]{.underline}.279 But without external reasons motivating a
settler exodus,280 [this kind of decolonizing moment is
counter-intuitive to the settler's civilizing mission because once land
has been invaded and seized, the settlers' continual struggle is to keep
the land for as long as possible]{.underline}. 281 In the United States,
the retention, exchange, and wealth-building through real [property is
so profoundly entangled with the fabric and structure of our commonplace
existence that **decolonization**---in the liberatory sense that evoke
how extractive colonial states often transition from colonial to
postcolonial eras---**appears unlikely or nearly
impossible**]{.underline}.

In modern historical memory, colonizer exodus occurred in various
extractive colonial experiences worldwide because the colonizers'
motivations and their relationships to their colonized subjects in those
colonial systems were different: land wasn't the fundamental contested
prize.282 It's more appropriate to presume that the process of settler
decolonization here has its contextual complications; but meanwhile our
mainstream collective consciousness is distractedly scanning and basing
progress on familiar decolonizing scripts from extractive colonial
experiences---those momentous oneoff moments of political and societal
liberation at the end of extractive colonial projects---because we don't
realize our "theoretical weakness" is not understanding our status as a
settler colony.283 Thus, we incorrectly impute Obergefell or Brown as
representing those liberating, decolonizing moments for us when what is
actually occurring is that such moments grant progress but also extend
the civilizing mission. What the queer sacrifice cases show here is that
what often appears watershed is illusory; interest convergence dominates
in the achievement of progress; and preservation is achieved despite
transformation. The actual process of decolonization in the settler
state likely ought to be a continual process that structures a
"no-strings-attached" version of self-determination.284 [Decolonization
in the settler state will probably not be accomplished by a **single**
momentous legal or social moment]{.underline}. [However, with some
unadulterated form of self-determination as its
lodestar]{.underline}---for instance, in the queer context, Ettelbrick's
idea of "justice"---[decolonization must be seen as a structural
**process** just like colonization itself was a
structure]{.underline}.285 In this way[, I **dispense with searching for
decolonizing narratives** that resemble the political liberation of
extractive colonies---ones that the settler state cloaks as vanishing
endpoints.]{.underline} Scholarly observations have suggested other
additional characteristics of settler decolonization that I agree with.
For instance, Saito notes that [decolonization as a structural process
that emphasizes self-determination must also initiate from the "ground
up" politically and personally]{.underline}, rather than top down.[286
It must also be context-specific]{.underline}.287 Further, historians
Yann Allard-Tremblay and Elaine Coburn intimate that [because settler
colonial projects persists continually in time, any process of
decolonization must also be understood in the same continual
"shape-shift\[ing\]" manner]{.underline}.288 [All of these insights
point to a continual, structured process, rather than one-off
events.]{.underline} Like Veracini, Saito, and others[, I also don't
offer a decolonizing script because of the **impracticability of doing
so.**]{.underline} But with all of the above in mind, I offer some
thoughts below on decolonization as a structural process in the context
of sexual minorities in this era of queer sacrifice.
