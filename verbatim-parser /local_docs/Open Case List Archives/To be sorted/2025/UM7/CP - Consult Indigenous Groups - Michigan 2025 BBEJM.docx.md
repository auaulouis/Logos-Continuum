[**[Consultation]{.mark} under Convention 169 [is a fundamental
right]{.mark}** of Indigenous peoples **[and]{.mark}** a fundamental
**[principle of inclusive development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.56 [Article
6(1) stipulates a general requirement to consult Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} [whenever legislative or administrative measures
directly affect]{.underline} [them]{.underline}.57 Consultation takes
place prior to decision-making, while participation (under the related
Article 7) is an ongoing dialogue that takes place throughout the
decision making process.58 [Convention 169 also provides specific
circumstances which raise an additional obligation to consult, including
exploration of mineral and subsurface resources]{.underline},59
alienation or transmission of Indigenous peoples' lands outside their
own communities,60 vocational training programs,61 and educational
programs.62 The ILO Committee of Experts on Application of Conventions
and Recommendations's (CEACR) 2011 General Observation clarified the
[**standards for [consultation]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} [Convention
169]{.mark}, which **[must]{.mark}**: (1) **[be]{.mark}** "formal, full
and exercised in **[good faith]{.mark}" in a "genuine dialogue between
governments and indigenous and tribal peoples** characterized by
communication and understanding, mutual respect, good faith and the
sincere wish to reach a common accord;" (]{.underline}2[) **put
"appropriate procedural mechanisms" in place at the national level
and**]{.underline} "in a form appropriate to the circumstances;" (3)
**[[involve]{.mark} "[indigenous]{.mark} and tribal peoples'
representative [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**" where considering
"legislative and administrative measures;" and (4) "be undertaken with
the objective of reaching agreement or consent to the proposed
measures."63 Governments are responsible for ensuring that Indigenous
participants have all relevant information provided in an intelligible
form and manner, providing sufficient time for Indigenous parties to
engage in internal decision-making processes, and making real effort to
understand how the Indigenous parties' decisionmaking processes
function, such that they may adapt the form and timing of consultation
to the Indigenous parties.64 Further, [the ILO sets out strict standards
for what individuals or organizations truly represent Indigenous
peoples, stating that "\[t\]he important criterion is that
**[representativeness should be determined through]{.mark}** **a process
of [the indigenous peoples]{.mark} themselves**]{.underline}."65 The
Indigenous representative must be able to clearly identify its
constituents and its accountability toward these constituents.66 [If
organizations are not truly representative of the communities, the
resulting consultations are not in compliance]{.underline} with
Convention 169.67 Finally, Article 6(1)(c) specifically provides that
[**[governments are responsible for]{.mark} establishing means and
providing resources** for developing Indigenous peoples' own
institutions and initiatives **for [building ongoing
dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}.68 **[The ILO established the
consultation process in order [to safeguard the rights of Indigenous
people to]{.mark} participate in the general civic life and to
[participate in the adoption of]{.mark} any [measures]{.mark}
[which]{.mark} may [affect them directly]{.mark}]{.underline}**.69 The
CEACR urges that, [**[without]{.mark} meaningful Indigenous
[consultation]{.mark}** and participation in matters that directly
affect Indigenous people, **economic [development is unlikely to reflect
the]{.mark} aspirations and [needs of Indigenous people and
implicates]{.mark} serious [repercussions]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the
[success]{.mark} and implementation [of development]{.mark}
programs**]{.underline}.70 The ILO's tripartite structure, built upon a
principle of equal representation of government, employer, and workers,
provides no dedicated avenue for representation of Indigenous people.71
This shortcoming has been criticized by Indigenous peoples.72 However,
the ILO maintains that "it has not been an obstacle in practice" to
Indigenous access to the ILO's supervisory mechanisms, pointing to
several cases of Indigenous people forming specific workers' and
employers' organizations, or chapters within broader organizations.73
The ILO further notes that in some countries, workers' and employers'
organizations form alliances with Indigenous people to address labor
violations affecting Indigenous individuals or communities and to
support Indigenous economic development and enterprise growth.74
Finally, the ILO points to the Program to Promote ILO Convention No. 169
(PRO 169)---its comprehensive technical assistance program that educates
and promotes application of Convention 169---that supports tripartite
constituents and Indigenous and tribal peoples in more than twenty-five
countries.75 Overall, [the ILO presents a positive-minded position on
the lack of a direct access channel for Indigenous representation in
applying and reporting on Convention **169**, touting the strength of
the tripartite model for leading to "greater cooperation among the
social partners, ensur\[ing\] stronger awareness and participation in
matters relating to international labour standards and eventually
**[lead\[ing\] to better governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}."76 This part
outlines the primary issues in consultation in practice and in the
potential application in the United States, including issues, proposed
resolutions, and remaining open questions. a. Lessons and Issues in
Consultation The Committee of Experts's ("the Committee") commentary on
Convention 169, in particular Article 6, reveals several clear, common,
and interrelated issues in implementing consultation. These include: •
failure to consult Indigenous and tribal peoples in the development of
the consultation process,77 • failure to develop sufficient consultation
procedures before undertaking decision-making that directly affects the
Indigenous and tribal peoples, 78 • failure to implement those
procedures appropriately such that they create favorable conditions for
achieving agreement or consent to the proposed measures (though actually
achieving agreement or consent is not required), 79 • failure to
establish a climate of mutual trust where [**[Indigenous]{.mark} and
tribal [peoples are historically marginalized]{.mark}** and mistrust
state institutions]{.underline}, 80 and • failure to establish genuine
dialogue that goes beyond mere informational meetings as required.81
Regarding consultation and participation on natural resources, the
Committee observed special difficulties in establishing a
solutions-oriented dialogue where economic and development industry
interests differ from the cultural, social, and economic interests of
the Indigenous people of the region.82 The next subsection illustrates
how **[[the Sámi]{.mark} [consultation]{.mark} process [in Norway
demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline}** examples of [**notable
[successes]{.mark}** in outlining a rigorous consultation
process]{.underline} and the challenges to that process that arose when
implementing an Arctic development scheme The ILO produced a document
detailing the challenges and successes Norway faced while pursuing the
consultation process with the Sámi, a population whose land Sápmi
(ancestral territory) lies across national borders of the four countries
now called Finland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.83 Norway became the
first country to ratify Convention 169 in 1990.84 [In 2003, Norway
sought to implement the consultation procedures with the]{.underline}
Sámediggi ([Sámi Parliament]{.underline}) [via the]{.underline} highly
contested [Finnmark Act]{.underline}.85 [Sámi institutions and legal
experts asserted the Finnmark Act did not meet Convention 169's
standards]{.underline}, and a debate ensued over whether the Finnmark
Act's process and substance sufficiently protected Sámi land, natural
resource rights, and the consultation requirement.86 [With significant
guidance and commentary from the CEACR, **[the]{.mark} Norwegian
government renewed** its **efforts to consult the Sámediggi and
developed a [dialogue process]{.mark} that [resulted in]{.mark}** (1)
**[the]{.mark} successful [adoption of a]{.mark} revised and [amended
Finnmark Act]{.mark}** in 2005 and (2) the formation of a joint working
group]{.underline} with representatives of the Sámediggi and the
Norwegian government [pursuing clarification of the legal standards for
Norway's duty to consult and development of a proposal]{.underline} for
mutually agreeable consultation procedures and guidelines.87 The joint
working group produced a report which identified Norway's various legal
obligations to the Sámi under international law and found Convention 169
to be Norway's most explicit commitment to Indigenous peoples' rights.88
One key aspect to the strength of **[[Convention
169]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that it [**[foregrounds]{.mark} the
[participation]{.mark} requirement** for the Indigenous peoples
concerned]{.underline}, realized through the provisions **[[establishing
the state's responsibility to develop a collaborative
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the Sámi, **[such that the
Indigenous community has the opportunity to participate in the
protection of its rights in an active, systematic, and culturally
responsive manner]{.underline}**.89 Reflecting this ideal, the 2006
guidelines outlined a "dual approach" to consultation and participation:
Sámi participation in the legislative process alone does not constitute
consultation, and Sámi consultation does not preclude participation in
the legislative process for issues of significance to them.90 The
guidelines aimed to establish an ongoing communication pattern by which
the Sámi's interests are considered from the outset of the legislative
process through participation, and, simultaneously, the Sámi are
supported in acting independently and making autonomous decisions
through exercising their traditional decision-making authorities through
consultation.91 Critically, the working group's 2005 procedures also
specify the geographical and substantive scope of the duty to consult.
The Norwegian government's obligation to consult the Sámediggi under
Convention 169 covers seven counties that are traditional Sámi areas,
all land dispositions, land interventions, and land rights within
traditional Sámi areas, and may include all material and immaterial
forms of Sámi culture.92 The procedures also recognize the difficulty of
determining precisely the traditional borders of Sápmi and give special
consideration to Sámi interests in those areas, even where Sámi culture
today is weak and its visibility has been diminished by decades of
erasure and assimilationist policies.93 After several years of biannual
meetings between Sámediggi and Norwegian state representatives, the ILO
produced a report reflecting optimism that a mutually agreeable
consultation procedure can be developed.94 [The Sámediggi urged that
**[the consultation process produced]{.mark}** positive experiences and
**[outcomes that]{.mark} could [serve as a
model]{.mark}**]{.underline}.95 Further, [after the Sámediggi identified
and cited a number of specific inadequacies that could be
addressed]{.underline}---including inadequate scope in the
administrative and political leadership representing the state,
inadequate information and background material, and procedural backlog
and deferral---[Norwegian state authorities took steps to conduct an
internal evaluation of the processes and both parties came to an
agreement on heightened standards for]{.underline} meetings,
communications, and procedures throughout [the consultation
process]{.underline}.96 However, some issues remained highly
contentious. The parties failed to reach agreement on the 2009 Norwegian
Minerals Act (the "Minerals Act"), a plan to explore and exploit
minerals owned by the state that directly affected Sámi land and
reindeer management.97 The Minerals Act provided that an exploring party
in Finnmark must "take reasonable steps to obtain information about
directly affected Sami interests in the area," and that the exploration
permit application might be refused if it would be contrary to Sámi
interests, providing an opportunity to comment for the Sámediggi, local
authorities, and reindeer management boards, but leaving ultimate
decisionmaking capacity to the Norwegian state authority.98 The
Sámediggi expressed serious concern that the Minerals Act did not
provide adequate consultations on mineral exploration permits in
Finnmark and other traditional Sámi lands, and in response, developed
its own draft guide for mineral resource exploration and development
that it adopted in 2010.99 The mineral guide was aimed at transparency
and predictability, intended to ensure that the Sámi could negotiate
about exploratory activities and operations, so that they would share in
the benefits of the business involving their land and continue their
strong relationships with businesses that benefit, strengthen, and
develop Sámi culture to coexist with traditional Sámi lifeways.100 The
Sámediggi urged that its mineral guide was an attempt to overcome a
situation in which the Sámediggi could not provide consent to all
mineral activities, recalling that the Sámediggi had refused the
Minerals Act and any activities regulated by it twice.101 Further, the
Sámediggi reminded the Norwegian state government of the real
consequences of proceeding with legislation that ran counter to Sámi
interests and to which the Sámi had not given their consent: the
Sámediggi held powerful sway with the private companies engaged in the
mineral business, and, historically, these mineral companies would stay
activity whenever the Sámediggi refused their consent.102 Ultimately,
the Sámediggi called for the Minerals Act to be clarified and revised
with respect to Sámi rights, and, as predicted, they were joined in this
call by the Norwegian Mineral Industry, the trade association for the
entire Norwegian mineral and mining industry that represents
approximately 160 member-companies and works in cooperation with the
Norwegian national industry association and industry suppliers of goods
and services.103 b. Consultation Applied in Arctic Shipping [If **the
United States** ratifies Convention 169, it **can take advantage of the
lessons** and warnings **from other nations when developing** and
implementing its **consultation procedures**. The United States could
follow the model pursued by Norway]{.underline} and the Sámediggi,
**[building its [consultation procedures with the Indigenous peoples of
the]{.mark} Alaskan [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** before developing its
shipping routes and infrastructure to support the industry. In terms of
representation, the United States could begin to reach out to groups
like the international ICC and the local Alaska Native Corporations,
including village and regional corporations, which would demonstrate
their representation and responsiveness to their constituents per
Convention 169's requirements. **[Building the consultation
process]{.underline}** before the polar shipping industry fully emerges
would **[[provide a proactive response]{.mark} to the concerns expressed
by Arctic Alaska Native people [and establish ongoing dialogue]{.mark}
about a growing industry that directly affects these marine peoples'
land and lifeways]{.underline}**. [The development of the consultation
process **also presents an expanded opportunity for Arctic Alaska Native
peoples to participate in shaping the industry** such that it comports
with the goal of coexisting with---rather than supplanting---the
traditional livelihoods. **[This]{.mark} further [aligns with]{.mark}
the principles of [Indigenous self-determination]{.mark} outlined in the
UNDRIP**]{.underline}.

**[[Seeking consent]{.underline}]{.mark}** from Traditional Custodians
helps to recognize their ownership, ensure appropriate respect is given,
and **[[helps to reduce]{.mark} the likelihood of causing
[harm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In order to gain real consent from
Traditional Owners, they must be appropriately informed, consulted with
in advance (early on in the planning process), and must be freely able
to consent (without coercion or manipulation). Many [**[Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}** have lived on the land for thousands of years, and
**[hold]{.mark} unique [knowledge]{.mark} built up over many
generations** --- especially traditional ecological knowledge
**[relevant to sustainable]{.mark} resource use and land
[management]{.mark}**. **[Organizations]{.mark} can [benefit from
consulting]{.mark} with Traditional Owners** to tap into any knowledge
that may impact their project or work]{.underline}. Avoid Conflict As
you'll see in some of the examples further down the page, **[[failing
to]{.mark} adequately [consult]{.mark} with Indigenous people can [lead
to disputes, conflicts,]{.mark} legal [challenges]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
project [delays]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[By]{.mark} appropriately
[engaging]{.mark}** with Indigenous stakeholders,
**[organizations]{.mark} may be able to anticipate and [avoid conflicts
before they escalate]{.mark} and impact the project**]{.underline}.
Build Social Acceptance Indigenous engagement is also often a
stakeholder expectation, with increasing understanding of the importance
of respecting indigenous customs, protecting cultural heritage, and the
value of traditional knowledge. As such, [**[engaging]{.mark} with First
Nations** and Traditional Custodians **[can]{.mark} also [lead
to]{.mark} broader [stakeholder and social acceptance]{.mark} [of
your]{.mark} organization and [project]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Strengthen Relationships By engaging with stakeholders, [organizations
**get an opportunity to [build relationships that can]{.mark} be
long-[last]{.mark}ing and mutually beneficial**]{.underline}. Not only
that, but [the process of building relationships and consulting can play
an important role in reconciliation]{.underline} as communities and
governments work to address historical wrongs committed against
Indigenous peoples. What's Involved in Consulting Traditional Owners?
The process of consulting with Traditional Owners is often part of the
overall stakeholder engagement process, including stakeholder
identification, stakeholder analysis, stakeholder mapping, and
implementation. However, some specific steps and considerations for
engaging with Indigenous people might include: Identifying the
Traditional Owners and relevant Indigenous groups by asking local
authorities and reviewing reliable sources Using appropriate cultural
protocols to communicate about your proposed policy, project, or
activity Engaging groups to seek their input, concerns, and approval for
any activities that impact them or their lands Actively seeking to avoid
or minimize impacts on culturally significant sites Engaging in
negotiation, where appropriate, to address any concerns raised by
Traditional Owners and incorporating their feedback into the project,
policy, or decision Where appropriate, formalizing agreements with
Traditional Owners to outline conditions for proceeding with the
project, including any protection measures and limitations Finally,
remember that [**genuine [engagement means]{.mark} [Indigenous]{.mark}
knowledge and [views are valued]{.mark}** and considered in your
decision-making]{.underline}. To understand the importance of genuine
engagement (and the harm caused by tokenistic or symbolic engagement),
check out Chapter 2.2 of the EPBC Act review that talks about how the
Act prioritized the views of western science over Indigenous knowledge
and views. 5 Examples That Demonstrate the Importance of Indigenous
Engagement [The best way to understand why engaging with First Nations
People and Traditional Owners matters is to look at some real life
examples where organizations got this right --- and wrong]{.underline}.
Western Australia Gas Development Image source: http://www.reuters.com/
Off the Pilbara coast of Western Australia, a large US\$12 billion gas
[development was put on hold in late 2023 after a Traditional Owner
brought forward a legal challenge in court]{.underline}, [claiming that
she was not adequately consulted]{.underline}. The judge ruled that the
original project approval was invalid, and the organization was required
to halt testing and resubmit an environmental plan properly informed by
adequate consultation with Traditional Owners. New South Wales Water
Resource Plan Image source: http://www.abc.net.au/ Also in late 2023,
the previously approved New South Wales Fractured Rock Water Resource
Plan was challenged by a confederation of 20 First Nations groups that
claimed the plan failed to meet its legal requirements to engage and
consult with Indigenous groups prior to approval. Concerns included:
Lack of consultation on cultural, social, and spiritual aspects tied to
water resources The plan not meeting criteria of the Murray-Darling
Basin plan Incomplete consultation with several First Nations groups
Some First Nations groups not consulted Waraba Naming (Caboolture West
Development) in South-East Queensland One positive example of engaging
with First Nations and Indigenous groups is the Waraba place naming
project in South-East Queensland. As part of the process to name the new
city and surrounding suburbs, the council engaged with the local Kabi
Kabi people to ensure any new names would be culturally and historically
appropriate, accurately reflect the local indigenous language, and have
support from Traditional Custodians. This was important to meet the
local Place Names Act 1994 legislation that stated 'There must be
consideration of place naming issues (6), including community views,
cultural and historical significance, and Aboriginal tradition and
Island custom'. But it also met the council's goals of gaining community
input into the naming processes to ensure the new names would be
influenced by community values and suggestions, and would help to
increase community support for the new names and boundaries. The chosen
city name, Waraba, comes from the Kabi Kabi language and means 'burn',
reflecting traditional land management practices, new life, and a
healthy land and people. Ontario Government Roads Through Traditional
Homelands In 2021, Neskantaga First Nation took Ontario to court
following their "recent experience of inadequate consultations on a
component of a larger road project that will run through \[the First
Nation's\] homelands", as well as the lack of guidelines in the
Environmental Assessment Act on how to consult indigenous communities in
crisis. Despite the community's inability to meet in person since the
pandemic began, the government held its consultation period and approved
the terms of reference for environmental assessments on the proposed
Ring of Fire roads. Ontario Housing Bill In 2022, the Ontario government
passed Bill 23 (the More Homes Built Faster Act) without consulting
First Nations, in spite of clashes with Indigenous communities over the
development. A leaked cabinet document even listed various concerns
about Indigenous communities' response to the bill (almost all negative
or critical), showing that the government was aware of the impact on
Indigenous stakeholders. In a statement released by Nishnawbe Aski
Nation Grand Chief Derek, the government was "respectfully advised that
**[[development cannot proceed without full recognition of the rights
of]{.mark} our [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

#### FPIC is [key]{.underline}\-\--only legally binding measures [ensure]{.underline} indigenous self determination

**Berry '13** (Carol Berry, Today correspondent for ICT, nonprofit
dedicated to Indigenous advocacy, "Laws Needed to Enforce U.N.
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: Legal Experts,"
November 7 2013,
https://ictnews.org/archive/laws-needed-to-enforce-un-declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-legal-experts/
//vo)

**[[Consent is not always legally binding]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Washburn continued, and FPIC "**[[needs to be incorporated into]{.mark}
U.S. [laws]{.mark}]{.underline}**," a position echoed by other speakers
at the daylong conference, held on the first day of Native American
Heritage Month, November 1. Panels dealt with climate change, resource
management and culture, among other topics. Speakers included human
rights activists, lawyers and company officials, among them Angela
Riley, Citizen Potawatomi Nation of Oklahoma, is director of the UCLA
American Indian Studies Center and co-director of the Native Nations Law
and Policy Center. Pawnee author and legal expert Walter Echo-Hawk spoke
as well, signing copies of his latest book, In the Light of Justice: The
Rise of Human Rights in Native America and the UN Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Fulcrum, 2013). [While Indigenous Peoples'
traditional abilities and age-old resources will play a role in future
global development, at [present]{.mark} **unfettered
[development]{.mark} [may be]{.mark} inequitable or [incompatible with
indigenous cultures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, panelists said. [**[It's a
question of whether indigenous societies can retain control]{.mark} over
traditional resources** as they are increasingly viewed as fodder for
potentially profitable ventures.]{.underline} A glaring example of
obstacles to this was illustrated by the recent Mi'kMaq First Nations
protests against exploration in New Brunswick, which exploded into
violence in October. As the Mi'kMaq and other dissent indicates, it has
been difficult to enforce the U.N. Declaration. The core of FPIC, which
shaped the conference's discussion, reads: "States shall consult and
cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through
their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free,
prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative
or administrative measures that may affect them." Carrying out the U.N.
Declaration on the ground has been a concern since its ratification in
2007. Specifics on business enterprise in indigenous areas were a major
part of the conference. The future direction of FPIC should take the
education of investors and shareholders into account, said Dan Morrison
of First Peoples Worldwide, noting that Mi'kmaq blockade against
Southwestern Energy had been costing the company \$60,000 per day as
activists objected to fracking exploration in New Brunswick.
Southwestern Energy, a U.S. transnational, had limited community
involvement, even though exploration took place on traditional
territories of the Elsipogtog and Mi'kmaq First Nations, said Morrison.
Speaking on a panel discussing "FPIC in Land & Natural Resources," he
pointed out that [**[morality alone may not guarantee]{.mark} resource
[protection]{.mark} for traditional societies**, [but]{.mark} that
**[financial incentives]{.mark}** and penalties
**[can]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Morrison's appraisal was echoed by
Shelley Alpern, a shareholder advocate at Clean Yield Asset Management,
who said companies are neglecting to realize or are ignoring the fact
that Indigenous Peoples can cost companies millions of dollars, making
it important to obtain FPIC before financial input. "[Projects are going
to continue on indigenous peoples' land]{.underline}," was the frank
assessment of Nicholas Cotts, a spokesperson from the Denver corporate
offices of the Newmont Mining Corp. [**[No]{.mark} overall [projects
have been halted by FPIC considerations]{.mark}**, he said, despite
intense protests over mining in Peru and on Western Shoshone traditional
lands in Nevada]{.underline}. Cotts said that future FPIC processes
would include drafting a letter of intent spelling out how Newmont would
behave and recognizing communities' rights as indigenous peoples, as
well as Newmont's right to explore on their land and to continue to
negotiate. Summing up the current state of indigenous resources
protection, Washburn added that an Executive Order from President Barack
Obama implementing the declaration is not likely. But, he added, there
is an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to consult with tribes
on their interests. Money itself may be a constraint to UNDRIP, Washburn
said. Although the administration has worked for years to protect tribal
water rights, \$1 billion has been spent on recent settlements, and it
will be hard to continue doing work on water settlements because of the
cost, he said. At bottom, [**[self-government and self-determination
"are the policy of our country]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Washburn said,
**[[so tribes should be allowed to exercise the same
latitude]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Authentic consultation's vital to Arctic policy success and legitimacy

Therefore, the current situation and new freeze of Arctic cross-border
cooperation is impacting Arctic Indigenous Peoples and several Permanent
Participants of the Arctic Council directly. The Arctic Council itself
(see Box 3: The Arctic Council) was co-established by three of the
Arctic Indigenous Peoples' organizations that later became Permanent
Participants while three more obtained this status after the council was
established. With its unique structure, the Arctic Council has become an
international example for other Indigenous Peoples around the world to
follow as best practice in their own engagement with nation states and
international institutions. [Although they participate in
many]{.underline} of the same [international and regional
forums]{.underline} as the Arctic states, [[Arctic Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark} are diverse and [have built]{.mark} very **[different
governance structures]{.mark}** in each of their respective
homelands]{.underline}. Furthermore, numerous [self-governance
arrangements have emerged as the Arctic has been
democratized]{.underline}. [What many Arctic Indigenous Peoples have in
common is they have been colonized by powers to their
south]{.underline}, such as the Russian Empire, France, Sweden, Finland,
Norway, Denmark, and England. Thus, [[they share having fought
for]{.mark} the implementation of [their **right to self-determination
and participation in decision-making**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Often, a
[Westphalian view on sovereignty and governance has been
dominant]{.underline}. [Peoples such as [the Inuit]{.mark}]{.underline}
have, from the beginning of the establishment of their international
organizations, [expressed their views on sovereignty and the
militarization of the Arctic; they [have strongly]{.mark} and
continuously [pushed for]{.mark} a [**peaceful use** of the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the Inuit Circumpolar Council's founding
meetings in 1977, a resolution concerning peaceful and safe uses of the
Arctic circumpolar zone called for both a moratorium on the emplacement
of nuclear weapons in the Arctic and for the Arctic not to become the
scene or object of human conflict or discord. Later Inuit Circumpolar
Council policies have included references to and further wording on the
demand of Inuit for their homeland to be used for peaceful purposes
only. These include the Inuit Sovereignty Declaration of 2009, the Inuit
Arctic Policy of 2010, and, most recently, the Inuit Circumpolar Council
General Assembly Declaration of 2022 that reiterates Inuit strength and
peace. [[Great powers]{.mark} and Arctic nation states [hold a]{.mark}
big [responsibility to include]{.mark} Arctic [Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark} in Arctic governance, [and to maintain]{.mark} and build
the **[diplomatic solutions]{.mark}** to shared challenges]{.underline}.
[Given that Arctic governance has been affected by and developed
**parallel to global Indigenous social and political movements** for the
recognition of Indigenous representation, [it will be difficult for
states to ensure legitimate decision-making if they do not include
Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} in related processes --
also [[in times of]{.mark} great [geopolitical
crises.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### In the past, both Russia and the United States have [refused]{.underline} to sign key legislations for Indigenous rights in fears of [undermining]{.underline} their [own sovereignty]{.underline}\-\--proves [binding]{.underline} consultation is [key]{.underline}.

4.1. Legal background on industry-indigenous relations in the US and
Russia

[Today, [indigenous peoples]{.mark} of the world and their ancestral
land [are in danger of alienation and cultural extinction because of the
triple-threat]{.mark} of climate change, assimilation, and destructive
extraction industries. Some [pieces of international legislation attempt
to shield]{.mark} indigenous communities and lands from these threats,
[such as]{.mark} the momentous United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples ([UNDRIP]{.mark}) of September 2007, [which seeks
to protect individual and collective indigenous rights.]{.mark} The
UNDRIP, an international agreement that took nearly twenty-five years to
design, has garnered different reactions from global powers. Indeed,
[neither Russia nor the United States]{.mark} initially [supported the
declaration]{.mark}, allegedly [on the grounds that support]{.mark} for
the declaration [could undermine their own sovereignty during land and
natural resource disputes]{.mark}.]{.underline}25

### Solvency\-\--Say Yes\-\--2NC 

#### Meaningful and continued consultation efforts increase Indigenous [cooperation]{.underline} with development projects.

Recent events in Canada have shown that **[resource [development
projects can face]{.mark} extensive [resistance from]{.mark} the
[affected Indigenous communities if consultation]{.mark} [efforts are
not meaningful]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and comprehensive, and address
the concerns of Indigenous Peoples and not just the legal requirements.
With all of the court cases on the books defining title and the duty to
consult, all the examples of how not to conduct engagement, and all the
examples of how to effectively and successfully engage with a community,
it is surprising that at this point in our history that we are still
climbing the learning curve. I launched my company, Indigenous Corporate
Training Inc., in 2002, with one Indigenous Awareness course. However, I
soon realized that there was a very great need for a course that
combined awareness with some guidance on how to effectively consult and
work with Indigenous communities. So, I pulled together my notes and
created Working Effectively with Aboriginal Peoples™ and a book of the
same name that was part of the course. The title of the course and the
book (now in its 4th edition) has evolved to Working Effectively with
Indigenous Peoples®. In gathering field notes for the book and course, I
noticed that some project proponents claimed their consultation process
was going well yet at the same time, the Indigenous communities they
were working with had a different perspective. In particular, the
proponents who left consultation solely or largely in the hands of the
government were experiencing additional costs, project delays, and
sometimes resistance, all of which put their project into major slowdown
mode. They were unaware or had little knowledge of any issues the
communities had with their project because they themselves had not
engaged directly with the community/ies. (Note the change in terminology
here. Do you know why we did it?) Alternatively, those [**[proponents
who consulted with]{.mark}** the **[communities early]{.mark}** on in
the process **[were not experiencing]{.mark} [the same]{.mark} degree of
[resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indigenous Engagement vs Indigenous
Consultation. Here\'s the difference. To put in perspective [the
potential risk associated with failing to include the Indigenous
communities early on in the process]{.underline}, I created this Risk
Assessment Model: meaningful-consultation-with-Indigenous-communities
Take a look at the diagram and the differences between the two
approaches to consultation. On the left, you see that First Nation
consultation is not even part of the process. While, legally, it is the
Crown, not industry that holds the duty to consult, it could be unwise
to leave the consultation solely in the hands of government agencies.
[**Sometimes [governments make]{.mark}** project approval **[decisions
without adequate consultation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (there have been
over 150 Supreme Court of Canada cases since Delgamuukw and Gisday\'way)
**[[which can put a project on the]{.mark} [path]{.mark}way [to
legal]{.mark} or regulatory process [challenges]{.mark} [and
ensuing]{.mark} costly [delays]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Some project
approvals are sent back for more consultation]{.underline}. Delgamuukw
and Gisday\'way: The Reason We All Consult Whereas, on the right side of
the diagram, you see an approach specifically designed to measure and
mitigate risk early in the development process. This approach, which has
the proponent [leading the **[consultation]{.mark}**, and doing so
**[early]{.mark} on in the process, [means key issues]{.mark},
priorities, and community decision-makers [are identified]{.mark}**.
**By engaging early, [a project proponent gains]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n
increased [likelihood of]{.mark} earning [community support]{.mark}
thereby [mitigating]{.mark}** the risk of the **[project
delays]{.mark}** due to resistance from the community]{.underline}.
Meaningful consultation means listening to the concerns of the
community/ies, discussing those concerns, and being prepared to
accommodate those concerns. Underlying all engagement and consultation
strategies should be the awareness that while you are there for the
duration of your project, [the [people]{.mark} you are engaging with
intend to be in the area forever, so **decision-making regarding land
use [will be concerned with a long-term]{.mark} [view]{.mark}** that
extends well beyond your project.]{.underline}

**[Say yes]{.underline}\-\--but only if [decision]{.underline} making
powers rest [entirely]{.underline} in Indigenous hands**

5.2.2.2. Indigenous-benefiting

[In the past, [Arctic communities have]{.mark} often [seen minimal
benefits from mines]{.mark} and energy projects]{.underline}
\[[[41]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462962500009X#bb0205)\].
Recognition of Indigenous rights has established pre-conditions for
distributing benefits and compensations for losses through agreements
\[[132]{.underline}\]. Impact and benefit agreements have become common
mechanisms across Canada and are increasingly taking place in northern
Fennoscandia \[[91]{.underline}\] and Greenland \[[96]{.underline}\].
These agreements are viewed as partnership-based mechanisms
\[[53]{.underline}\], however the extent of consultation, negotiation,
and accommodation varies significantly from project to project. In
Canada, an [[Inuit community]{.mark} in Nunavut that [lived through
multiple mines "]{.mark}have [learned that development]{.mark} of
non-renewable resources [cannot benefit]{.mark} Arctic communities
[unless they are actively involved in the planning and
development]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} \[[41]{.underline}\]. The
authority and mineral rights of Nunavut since the signing of the Nunavut
Land Claims Agreement (NLCA) have enabled control and decision-making
power over resource development on Inuit lands \[[41]{.underline}\]. The
NLCA has [provided [grounds for equitable]{.mark} and responsible
[relationships of accountability,]{.mark} and [improved]{.mark} shared
[understanding between stakeholders and Indigenous peoples]{.mark}
\[41\].]{.underline}

There is a growing interest in partnering with Indigenous groups through
equity-based models. In Canada, for example, a growing number of
policies support or require Indigenous equity participation in renewable
energy and hydro power projects. These [partnerships have [the potential
to provide an opportunity]{.mark} for Indigenous peoples [to exercise
control over decision-making and benefit distribution]{.mark}, thereby
[safeguarding their interests and values]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite
potential benefits, research remains cautious about the true benefits to
Indigenous peoples, in particular, in localities where Indigenous agency
and ability to effectively make decisions and take control over project
design might be limited. Meaningful benefits are more likely to be
realised in smaller community-scale projects where Indigenous
communities have greater direct control and involvement in
decision-making, with limited research addressing outcomes of Indigenous
co-ownership in large-scale projects \[[133]{.underline}\]. Actual
dynamics and effectiveness of these arrangements at play may vary
depending on the levels of agency, leadership, and [decision-making
power granted to Indigenous partners.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--Say Yes\-\--Resource Development\-\--2NC 

**Tribes say yes\-\--economic benefits incentivize it\--BUT consultation
is key**

[The [demand for minerals]{.mark} critical to both the energy transition
and U.S. national security [is growing]{.mark} rapidly.]{.underline} At
the same time, the reliability of the global supply chain is being
challenged by geopolitical events. The result is a growing call to bring
more mining for these critical minerals back to the United States, where
the [[vast majority of critical mineral reserves]{.mark} are
[located]{.mark} [on]{.mark} or within 35 miles of [Native]{.mark}
American [reservations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Tribal communities are [some of the poorest in communities]{.mark} in
the United States.]{.underline} Even though they are collectively the
largest landowners outside the federal government, Native Americans
continue to experience persistent poverty by every measure. How can the
United States have a legitimate critical minerals discussion knowing
that its most vulnerable population sits on the largest concentration of
mineral wealth left in this nation? 

Historically, [[mining on tribal lands]{.mark} has been [a tale
of]{.mark} economic [exploitation,]{.mark} abrogated agreements, [stolen
lands, environmental disasters, and]{.mark} life-altering health
impairments]{.underline} inflicted on the Native American community.
Indian country continues to grapple with the consequences to this day.
On Navajo lands alone, nearly [30 million tons]{.underline} of uranium
ore were extracted between 1944 and 1989. This has caused [[lingering
health problems]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Navajo people,
[[from]{.mark} both [environmental contamination]{.mark} at the mine and
mill sites, [and]{.mark} from living in houses built with [mine]{.mark}
and mill [waste.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Today, [[there is a]{.mark} generational [opportunity to]{.mark} learn
from this very difficult history and [introduce]{.mark} a new age of
[equitable]{.mark} U.S. [mining]{.mark} in partnership with tribal
communities.]{.underline} Modern sustainable techniques can limit the
physical impact of mining and processing activities, and new
international protocols have been developed around the world, [such as
in Canada]{.underline}, to ensure local tribal communities are engaged
throughout the process. [Unlike most current policies in the United
States, these [protocols]{.mark} are [mandated to seek the consent
of]{.mark} local [Indigenous peoples before regulatory approval]{.mark}
is given.]{.underline}

[[The potential for]{.mark} tribes to [benefit from mining is
significant.]{.mark} An example is]{.underline} [the Thacker Pass
lithium mine in northern Nevada]{.underline}. This mine, which is
expected to [produce enough lithium to supply batteries to roughly one
million electric vehicles per year]{.underline}, will at its
peak [[provide]{.mark} 1,100 [jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}. The project is
located on federal land that are the traditional lands of the Fort
McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe and is culturally, historically, and
spiritually significant to the tribe.

[[Tribes can benefit]{.mark} from the Thacker Pass project and others
like it [by working with developers]{.mark} on community benefits plans
(CBPs).]{.underline} These CPBs could [[include]{.mark} commitments
related to construction of the mine related to [jobs,]{.mark} workforce
development, [childcare]{.mark} service capacity and [procurement
opportunities]{.mark} for tribal member businesses to sell goods and
services to the mine.]{.underline} In the long term, the CPBs could
include entrepreneurial-focused initiatives, such as [business
incubation, educational [scholarships, housing,]{.mark} and [access
to]{.mark} clean [water and electricity]{.mark} for tribal
members.]{.underline}

Most importantly[, [any]{.mark} new [approach to mining]{.mark} in the
American West [should recognize and respect tribal sovereignty]{.mark},
and [provide tribes]{.mark} more [control over and access to mining
profits]{.mark}]{.underline}. This might be as simple as [granting
affected tribes an ownership stake, a strategy that was constitutionally
provided for in Alaska in 1971 and benefited the communities surrounding
the Red Dog Mine in Northwest Alaska,]{.underline} but has never been
enjoyed elsewhere in the United States.

A logical further ambition is for [[tribes]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark}
the c[apacity to run their own mining companies]{.mark}, staffed with
leadership and engineering talent from tribal communities]{.underline}.
In order to do this, potential tribal developers need to gain expertise
in the mining and processing of critical minerals, which is different
from the sand and gravel enterprises, coal mines, or oil and natural gas
drilling they know well.

It is worth noting that the Interagency Working Group on Mining Laws,
Regulations, and Permitting, in its recently issued [final
report ]{.underline}on ways to improve the way mining is conducted on
U.S. public lands, included recommendations that would help tribes
negotiate CPBs. Specifically, the report recommended early and regular
tribal engagement on the design of a new leasing system and
environmental review processes and to provide "Grants for Tribes and
communities to obtain technical assistance, or support technical reviews
during permitting, engagement and consultations."

If the United States is going to develop new critical minerals
domestically, it needs to find a new pathway that acknowledges sins of
the past, is inclusive to local Native American communities, encourages
the financial participation of tribal governments, and provides a
legitimate social license to operate.

At least three things can help: [First, [a national dialogue is
needed]{.mark} immediately. The [long and sordid history]{.mark} of
battle between tribal communities, federal and state governments, the
mining industry, and environmental groups, [as well as
disagreements]{.mark} between and within tribal communities, [should be
resolved. ]{.mark}]{.underline}This begins with a full and formal
acknowledgement of inequities, both past and present. What could
initially be uncomfortable lines of communication have to be established
between former adversaries and a common agreement of basic tribal rights
established before the United States can move forward as a country. 

Second, [existing [U.S. laws and regulations should be updated]{.mark}
and improved [to]{.mark}]{.underline} include new protocols that are
more in line with today's international community and [[seek]{.mark} not
just [consultation with]{.mark} affected tribal communities, but their
[consent]{.mark}. It is imperative that [tribal governments and]{.mark}
their [citizens]{.mark} [be adequately consulted]{.mark} and included
[in any]{.mark} proposed [mine's planning,]{.mark} development,
construction, and ultimate reclamation---[from the start]{.mark}, and
[on their terms.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Third, the federal government needs to create an ecosystem that will
allow tribally owned corporations to invest profits into creating and
increasing wealth and income over the next decades. New federal economic
incentives would greatly accelerate this effort. [[Tax policy
levers]{.mark} could be considered that would [make critical minerals
development]{.mark} on tribal lands [more economically
attractive.]{.mark}]{.underline} This could incorporate existing tax
credit-based programs, like Opportunity Zones, New Market Tax Credits,
or Production and Investment Tax Credits, to specifically encouraging
investment in critical mineral operations on tribal lands[. There could
also be new [specific tax credits for]{.mark} things like [hiring
Native]{.mark} American [employees]{.mark} to support critical mineral
development and operations.]{.underline}

Tribal communities have sacrificed enormously on behalf of the American
people for centuries. Now they are being asked once again to offer their
lands in the name of a greater good. Their willingness to do so is
deeply inspiring and deserves the best of the American people and their
government. It also deserves real and lasting economic and social
benefits to the tribes.

[Globalisation, and the surge for fossil resources]{.underline} at the
turn of the century, [meant that [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
had remained relatively untouched compared to other regions in the
world, [[became the target of mining companies]{.mark} in search of more
resources to extract]{.underline}. However, economic investments
(especially those connected to resource extractions) are [a double-edged
sword for human security in the Arctic]{.underline}. As pointed out by
some interviewees, [[extractive industries can]{.mark} either [have
a]{.mark} positive or [negative impact on Arctic human security]{.mark},
[depending on how]{.mark} such [activities]{.mark} and investments [are
carried out]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Interview 6, 12\].

Extractive industry development [[can bring economic benefits]{.mark} to
the circumpolar Arctic and its inhabitants, [as the region has]{.mark} a
significatively [low employment rate]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
unemployment gap is further [[exacerbated between Indigenous]{.mark}
peoples [and non-Indigenous]{.mark} local [inhabitants]{.mark} of the
Arctic]{.underline}. According to the Canadian Government, in 2016,
'among the Inuit working age population in Nunavut, 45% were employed
while 18% were unemployed and 37% were not in the labour force', whilst
89% of the non-Inuit working age population were employed, with 3%
unemployed and 8% not in the labour force.34 Similarly, the unemployment
rate among Russia's Indigenous peoples 'has been estimated at between 30
percent and 60 percent, which is 3 to 4 times higher than that of other
residents of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation'.35

However, [[poor methods of extraction]{.mark} can be [associated
with]{.mark} increased [pollution and]{.mark} can [endanger
biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Moreover, resource
extraction has [impacted the security of some Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} in some areas of the Canadian Arctic. A report from
Qamani'tua, Nunavut, explains that '[[community members reported the
loss of caribou]{.mark} directly [connected to]{.mark} the Meadowbank
[mine \[]{.mark}and\] have stopped fishing or gathering near the
mine']{.underline}.36 [[Women]{.mark} have [reported increased]{.mark}
incidents of [racism, harassment, and domestic violence in relation to
the]{.mark} Meadowbank [mine]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}37 Arctic
extractive industry development should be aware that [risks to the
security of Indigenous women can be dangerous side-effects of mining
projects,]{.underline} as it has frequently been the case with [attacks
and rape]{.underline} in Papua Nuova Guinea, Nigeria, and Myanamar.38
Although Arctic states generally have strong legal and regulatory
systems, [companies should keep a close eye on human rights
violations]{.underline} especially when the project is enacted in a
remote, rural community and requires 'large groups of transient,
outside, mostly male, workers to be brought into the area'.39

Therefore, [[Arctic people face a trade-off]{.mark}: the [investments
that could enhance]{.mark} their [economic security]{.mark} and
well-being [could]{.mark} simultaneously [put their]{.mark} human
[security at risk]{.mark},]{.underline} if proper risk reduction
measures are not put in place. [This [triggers a feedback loop
where]{.mark} local communities, and especially [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}, tend to [oppose investments]{.mark}]{.underline}
because they feel that their personal and community security can be put
at risk. However, [by opposing investments, [communities remain poor,
remote, and dependent]{.mark} on their central governments]{.underline}

states rises, the author believes the multitude of co-management systems
and the multi-level, inter-governmental and inter-organizational
relationships they have nurtured across the region that began as
mechanisms for joint resource post-Cold War years to include traditional
pillars of Inuit interest -- environmental, climate, human and cultural
security -- in addition to the traditional pillars of state interest
defined primarily as the equilibrium of state, armed forces, and
populace (one of Clausewitz's central trinities, as well as the
foundation of political order developed by Machiavelli during the
Renaissance, and by Plato further back, during the Golden Age of
Athens). On Thin Ice was, at heart, an effort to synthesize the
dialectical battle between 'sovereignty' and 'security' so that domestic
and not just international values were protected by the national
defense, as Grant's work examined. Further, my third book, Arctic Doom,
Arctic Boom: The Geopolitics of Climate Change in the Arctic
(ABC-Clio/Praeger Security and the Environment, 2010) looked at the
emerging geopolitics of the polar thaw and its transformation to the
Arctic's political geography resulting in unprecedented sea ice loss and
the opening of what Rob Huebert and Brooks Yeager have called the "New
Sea" in 2008, finding that future 'cooperation' and 'conflict' were
equally plausible outcomes of what Ed Struzik has called the 'Big Thaw'
(Ed Struzik, The Big Thaw: Travels in the Melting North (Boston: Wiley,
2009)). [[Management at the local]{.mark} and regional domestic

domestic unity between tribe and state, but between states as
well,]{.mark} **[catapulting mechanisms]{.mark} designed [for domestic

as illustrated in the research on Inuit transnationalism by Jessica
Shadian, among others -- who began with transnational cooperation at the
substate level in the 1970s and evolved increasingly from substate to
international actor, leveraging the theoretical ambiguity presented by
the duality of their domestic Westphalian and transnational existence.
Amidst this evolution from the domestic to the international stage,
Inuit leaders brought their insights and experiences from co-managing
their home-lands with their respective sovereigns to global politics --
and one might argue that the [structure established by the]{.underline}
formation of the [Arctic Council]{.underline} in 1996 [borrows
from]{.underline} the [domestic co-management]{.underline} experience
the unique and successful roles and responsibilities of the Permanent
Participants of the Council, which are the regional Indigenous
organizations newly empowered at the domestic level in Arctic North
America (if not universally in other regions of the Arctic) -- which
like their domestic co-management counterparts lack decision-making
power but gain access, influence, and importantly, a prominent seat at
the table with their sovereign counterparts (the eight full members of
the Council, representing its eight founding sovereign states), a
compromise that both satisfies the sovereign members of the Council
while meeting the needs and aspirations of the Permanent Participants
well despite the asymmetry in formal power.

#### [Collaborative]{.underline} decision-making and Indigenous self-determination is key to managing [state competition]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Armitage's earlier 2007 co-edited volume (with Berkes and Doubleday) on
adaptive co-management, institutional learning, and multi-level
governance illustrates the [globalization and universalization of
co-management]{.underline} far [beyond the Arctic region]{.underline}.
Its case studies include northern examples of co-management from Alaska,
Yukon, NWT and Nunavut as might be expected, as well as case studies of
co-management in places as diverse as Vancouver Island, Southern Ontario
and Atlantic Canada in Canada\'s southern provinces; in addition to
Wisconsin in the United States; Belize, Barbados, and Granada in the
Central America/Caribbean region; and Sweden in Europe. Indeed,
co-management has truly gone global. Former Yukon Premier Tony Penikett
has observed that [Native treaties]{.underline} in Canada
[are]{.underline} themselves "[**inherently international** because
natives are transnational]{.underline}," [even if
governments]{.underline} in North America [still view Natives as
"domesticated" components of their constitutional polities]{.underline}.
To Penikett, land claims treaties and the many [[comanagement
structures]{.mark} they yielded [are "**remarkable nation-building
achievements**," helping]{.mark} to [offset]{.mark} earlier colonial-era
treaties and the "[historic failures]{.mark} of colonizing states [to
respect]{.mark} their [treaty promises]{.mark}]{.underline}." (Penikett,
2014) Looking to the future, [as]{.underline} the [polar thaw
drives]{.underline} continuing [[Arctic]{.mark}
globalization]{.underline}, and non-Arctic states show increasing
interest in Arctic lands, waters and resources, [the **strategic [center
of mass]{.mark}** for engaging in Arctic enterprises]{.underline} of all
sorts [[will be]{.underline}]{.mark} the myriad [[co-management]{.mark}
structures]{.underline} that define the post-land claims political
topography of Arctic North America. Just [as co-management strives to
[institutionalize the]{.mark}]{.underline} dynamic [[balancing of
competing]{.underline}]{.mark} traditional and modern values, and of
[[tribal and state powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, [it could [establish a
foundation for]{.mark} the **[diplomatic balancing]{.mark}** of Arctic
interests]{.underline} and non-Arctic interests alike.
[Co-management]{.underline} can [thus [form a **vital nexus**]{.mark} at
the very heart of Arctic globalization]{.underline}. Co-management
[introduces a **collaborative decision-making** process]{.underline}
that is at heart adaptive, and as such [is [well-suited to]{.mark} the
arrival of [new actors]{.mark}]{.underline} on the Arctic stage with
values, interests, and capabilities that may differ profoundly from
their local, regional and indigenous counterparts. Just as co-management
has successfully (but not always frictionlessly) negotiated an
equilibrium between contending traditional and contemporary values, and
between tribal [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} state interests, it could
[[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a
metaphor, but [[an **institutional foundation**, for the **management
of**]{.mark} the emergent **[state competition]{.mark}** gathering steam
[in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Looking forward, it appears **[we are at a crossroads]{.underline}**:
there is still [[every opportunity for the Arctic to remain a zone of
international peace]{.mark} and cooperation]{.underline}, [[so long
as]{.mark} the many [stakeholders]{.mark} in the Arctic continue to
[work]{.mark} **collaboratively**, and to find ways to align their
interests]{.underline}. But there is also the specter of the
re-emergence of a new Arctic Cold War, should such a collaboration prove
incompatible with the future actions of the many states vying for Arctic
influence and involvement. [Whether the path forward is]{.underline}
continued exceptionalism or [a]{.underline} collapse in the [peaceful
Arctic order depends much on the willingness of new Arctic stakeholders
[to uphold]{.mark} the **[collaborative commitments]{.mark}** embraced
by the Arctic states and the indigenous peoples of the Arctic, and
[which establish]{.mark}ed [trust]{.mark} and cooperation
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} the creation of
**[[joint-governing]{.mark} mechanisms]{.underline}**, such as the many
comanagement regimes established after land claims were settled. An
interesting barometer of this will be whether the new Arctic
stakeholders engage respectfully with the co-management system. While
the Arctic Council's member states and indigenous permanent participants
reflect, to a large measure, the original parties to the co-management
process that took root in the Arctic after land claims were settled,
recent years have witnessed the proliferation of observer states that
now participate in Council meetings from well outside the Arctic,
including the industrialized maritime states of Asia with domestic
markets hungry for natural resources, shipping companies that can
benefit from emergent Arctic sea lanes, and the technological
capabilities needed for Arctic resource and infrastructure development.
There is [much potential for]{.underline} North-South [partnerships as
Arctic globalization continues]{.underline}; but [in order to
proceed]{.underline}, knowledge of and [respect for]{.underline} these
many [localized systems of co-management is **essential**.]{.underline}

#### Involvement of Native leaders in decision-making builds [equity]{.underline} in trust --- that allows for [collaborative security efforts]{.underline} to check foreign encroachment.

[Climate change impacts, **sovereignty validation**, and economic
development are just a few shared interests between Indigenous
communities and organizations, and national government
interests.]{.underline} However, [approaches to Indigenous people's
inclusion continue to require **further attention**]{.underline}. For
instance, issues of trust, unresolved historical trauma, and
well-defined pathways that actualize [[a shared]{.mark} strategic
[vision to deter foreign encroachment]{.mark}, protect resources, and
defend, if necessary, [warrant]{.mark} more effort]{.underline}. [[An
enduring trust relationship]{.mark} between Indigenous leaders is
**foundational and necessary**]{.underline}. Identifying and
[[navigating collaboratively]{.mark} those [shared
problem]{.mark}]{.underline} sets can [serve as a means to [build
**equity** in trust that]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[lead to a]{.mark}
more **[unified]{.mark} and synergized [effort]{.mark}** [to
secure]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Indigenous people [[while strengthening]{.mark} the [security]{.mark}
posture]{.underline} of the homeland. [Securing the North American
Arctic is dependent]{.underline}, in part, [on]{.underline} the
populace's [understanding of]{.underline} the various emerging
[vulnerabilities]{.underline} to permit the formation of effective and
innovative efforts. Economic competition, maritime control, cyber
manipulations, and climate change are examples of
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[can be approached
collaboratively]{.mark} between government agencies]{.underline}, vested
organizations, [and Indigenous enterprises]{.underline}. The [[process
to]{.mark} [developing]{.mark} innovative [solutions is iterative in
that]{.mark} political [**power must be shared** with Indigenous people
to permit conversations to be legitimized]{.mark}.]{.underline}
**[[Without a voice with power, inclusivity is
limited]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Many recognize there are many issues to
be resolved to rectify past grievances and address inequities that
continue unabated in governing and social policies, systemic biases,
social norms, and other forms that perpetuate colonialist attributes.
Yet, there are four domains that could serve useful in contributing to
the emerging narrative of trust, security, and sovereignty: economic
development, social accountability, political purposefulness, and
cultural autonomy. [Building shared experiences]{.underline} that fuel a
purposeful and meaningful set of behaviors that [contribute
to]{.underline} the social well-being that is more equitable increases
[trust relations]{.underline}. First of the domains is economic
development contributes to multifaceted aspects of security. Food and
water security, medical security, and shelter security are just a few
types of security that are directly influenced by economic development.
Governing bodies with financial resources are proportionately more
capable to develop infrastructure, to provide social care, to maintain
operations for municipal functioning, and to develop innovations. With
the right balance of federal agencies contracting services, projects,
and equipment with rural Indigenous companies employing their own
people, Native communities have greater capacities to invest in their
communities. However, it must exceed the threshold from marginally
surviving to a level where prosperity is possible. Some approaches to
consider include increased economic opportunities that can be wide in
range. For instance, with infrastructure projects, defense forces
collaborate and coordinate with Indigenous companies and municipalities
to identify those projects that could have dual usage. Airstrips,
control towers, roadways, and marine ports are just a few examples of
projects that could be enhanced to meet commercial or public needs while
providing capacity for military use. This shared usage could provide
access and maneuverability for military forces while commercial
enterprises could advance innovations and scalability. Second, social
accountability allows for Indigenous people to rectify marginalizing
policies and practices. Regrettably, history throughout Canada and the
U.S. is replete with traumatic practices that continue to have
ramifications. Marginalizing women as noted in the Indian Act is an
example of how existing policies in Canada demonstrate the need to
improve access to all.\[xii\] Many rural Alaska Native communities are
without adequate sanitation systems or potable water. Instead, there are
villages where individual households have to portage their human waste
from the house to a sewage collection point.\[xiii\] The health
disparities alone are well documented that range from disproportionate
rates among Native people of diabetes, hypertension, and life
expectancy, for instance. These kinds of conditions are potential
invitations for other nation-state actors whose intentions might be more
nefarious as they seek inroads into communities to better understand
vulnerabilities and influence public opinion. Improving healthcare
accessibility is one area that could contribute to the collective psyche
of inclusivity while improving wellness among rural Indigenous
communities. During the COVID pandemic, many rural communities had
difficulties accessing health care because of the limitations of flights
to healthcare hubs. Developing partnerships between the military
aircraft could be one means to support the transportation for
maintenance parts villages need to operate generators. Then, such
transportation could be used to assist individuals who need care that is
beyond the village's capacity and could be brought to a more appropriate
healthcare facility. Third, [political purposefulness]{.underline} in
this context [connotates establishing and reinforcing political power to
Indigenous governing systems]{.underline}. [A part of the trust
responsibility **reinforcing the sovereignty of Native
people**]{.underline}. Internal sovereignty permits Indigenous people to
self-govern and make policy decisions that are more culturally attuned
or relevant. [[Providing opportunities for Native leaders to]{.mark}
[contribute to]{.mark}]{.underline} defense or security [conversations
and [decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline} activities
[improve]{.underline} the [chance that Indigenous equities
are]{.underline} represented and [included in the formation of laws,
policies, and practices]{.underline}. Instead of vying for political
power or control for self-service, focusing on external issues, such as
those noted above, [[shift the motivation to be]{.underline}]{.mark}
more [[collaborative]{.underline}]{.mark} in solving problems and
building opportunities [[based on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[shared
value]{.underline}]{.mark}** of improving national security.
Unfortunately, efforts by the privileged must come to terms with the
realities of the disparities and compromise for the betterment of the
collective. The past grievances highlighted by Indigenous people must be
acknowledged and efforts made to reconcile satisfactorily. Native people
are making important shifts in the political equity scale but it is far
from balanced. [Greater efforts are **needed** to include Native
voices]{.underline} with influence [to shape]{.underline} the [larger
conversations of national security that incorporates Indigenous concerns
and wishes]{.underline}. When examining the impacts of climate change,
[it is in both federal agency partners and the Indigenous governing
entities to find]{.underline} **[collective solutions]{.underline}**
that address critical concerns. Melting of permafrost impacts military
infrastructure stability while warming temperatures influence fisheries
and sea mammal life patterns. [Finding overlaps]{.underline} on those
shared problem sets can exemplify commitments to find common ground to
complex issues while [build]{.underline}ing [trust in]{.underline} both
the [interactions and outcomes]{.underline}. Lastly, as economic and
health disparities reduce, power distribution moves more equitably, and
Indigenous representation becomes more incorporated in the shared
security responsibility, cultural sovereignty gains greater legitimacy.
With greater political capital, economic influence, and social equity,
cultural identity development is more likely. Traditional practices,
language revitalization, and other forms of cultural expression can
become further embraced and accepted within and alongside Indigenous
communities. Subsistence living is greatly associated with cultural
identity among Native people in Alaska. \[xiv\]Management of caribou
herds, fisheries, and lands exemplify how the lifestyle that depends on
nature to feed, heal, and protect Alaska Native people are a part of the
identity of what it means to be Native. Advocating game and fishery
management, for instance, has been an area Native people campaigned to
ensure their communities can feed themselves. Synchronizing hunts
according to the natural cycles has worked for Native people since time
immemorial. This is a part of the cultural identity and development as
tools are prepared, young hunters are brought into the hunt, and meat is
shared among the community, generation after generation. The
[[collaborative possibilities to address]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark} of the North American Arctic [[**must be
inclusive** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Aboriginal
people]{.underline}]{.mark} of the lands. There is a vested interest by
all citizens in protecting natural resources that support a way of life,
countering competitive encroachment, and fostering development and
sustainability. [**[Authenticating]{.mark} [the sovereignty]{.mark}**
[of both Indigenous people and federal governments]{.mark}]{.underline}
is not without friction or competition. However, keeping the focus on
how to secure maritime borders, enforce the rule of law, and deter
foreign nefarious activities are just a few areas where collaboration
[can **promote a trust narrative**]{.underline} that can usurp the
historically traumatizing one. Arguably, Native people are also citizens
of their respective countries and must be included in national-and
allied-level security conversations. There is a shared responsibility to
secure the North. With increased trust comes increased capacity to
collaborate on finding solutions to inherent conflicts that emerge from
solving security-related issues. The results lead to a narrative that
honors cultural diversity, shares political power, and advances economic
equities more equitably across the North American Arctic region.

[[Arctic North America]{.underline}]{.mark} -- from the Bering Strait to
Baffin Bay -- [[presents us with]{.underline}]{.mark} a fascinating
realm of settled land claims, dynamically evolving systems of indigenous
and regional governance, [[distinctly indigenous and
collaborative]{.mark} international [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
flexible balancing of subsistence culture with economic modernization
and development, blending two worlds, one traditional, one contemporary
-- presenting us with a compelling example of enduring order in the
absence of strong state institutions and without traditional tools of
border fortification and security [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} one
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark}, with careful localization, **[[apply to
the world at large]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the Arctic, one finds
[compelling evidence that [not all regions of the world must be defined
by realist]{.mark} presumptions of]{.underline} ubiquitous
[international [anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[nor dominated by]{.mark}
armed conflict and political [violence]{.mark} in the absence of
centralized state powers]{.underline}. Across Arctic North America,
[[tribal polities and sovereign states have developed their own ways to
**mitigate regional conflict**]{.mark} and]{.underline} to
[foster]{.underline} peaceful [and collaborative interaction across
borders]{.underline}, frequently borrowing ideas and emulating policies
for application from adjacent areas, and [entering
[in]{.mark}to]{.underline} a wide assortment of cross border agreements
and [regulatory [regimes for collaboratively managing
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} (and wildlife resources) [that transcend
borders such as]{.underline} polar bear, beluga whales, caribou, and
fisheries management. That the modern state, in its many northern forms,
overlaps with such a diverse and multiethnic mosaic of underlying
indigenous regional and transnational networks, has resulted in the
gradual emergence of a diverse, increasingly inclusive, and fascinating
political culture across the Circumpolar North, particularly so in
Arctic North America. [[It's not always **frictionless**
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}, [since there are]{.underline} times
and [issues where interests]{.underline} can and do [clash]{.underline}

Successful [[collaboration between]{.mark} the [Indigenous peoples
and]{.mark} the [sovereign states]{.mark} of Arctic North America has
[helped]{.mark} to **[stabilize the Arctic]{.mark} region**, [fostering
**meaningful Indigenous participation** in Arctic
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} through the introduction of new
institutions of self-governance at the municipal, tribal and territorial
levels, [and successful diplomatic collaborations **at the international
level** through the Arctic Council and other international
fora]{.underline}. [Undergirding each of these pillars of Indigenous
participation in Arctic governance is a **mutuality of commitment** to
the principle of collaborative Arctic governance that has united
Indigenous peoples and the state]{.underline} across Arctic North
America through their shared experience of post-land claims settlement
co-management of lands and resources, from the Bering Strait to Baffin
Bay. Indeed, [[co-management]{.underline}]{.mark} has become so widely
and reciprocally embraced by tribal peoples and states alike that it now
[presents us with a **viable and scalable foundation** for bridging the
Indigenous, transnational world with the Westphalian world of states and
statecraft]{.underline} across the entirety of the circumpolar Arctic,
[by strengthening the bonds]{.underline} between the two
[forged]{.underline} through their joint governing experience [[at the
**domestic level**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which [in turn
**informs**]{.mark} **and inspires** [the relationship between the
eight]{.mark}]{.underline} founding member [[states of the

The [[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} over
time increasingly [reciprocal]{.underline} institutional and
[[intergovernmental relationships between]{.mark} sovereign [states and
Indigenous stakeholders at the domestic level]{.mark}]{.underline}, [has
[contribute]{.mark}d]{.underline} increasingly [[to]{.mark}
a]{.underline} shared [spirit of [international
collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[referred to as Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [embedding it]{.underline} on
multiple levels of governance, [from the local and tribal
to]{.underline} the regional and territorial all the way to [the
national and international]{.underline} level. These institutions are
increasingly reflected in a growing and important literature on the
influence of nonstate actors, primarily Indigenous organizations and
self-governing institutions, but other actors are included such as NGOs
and subnational governments, illuminating the underlying complexity of
the Arctic domestic and international political system, and informing
comparative studies of Indigenous-state relations across the regions.
There is also a subset of the substate/nonstate literature that looks
specifically at institutions and mechanisms of co-management, which
brings together the competing stakeholders and their divisions along the
cooperation/conflict, homeland/frontier, and sovereignty/security
continua that traditional divide the field of Arctic international
relations.2 There has also emerged in recent years a substantial and
growing body of works on the Arctic Council which provides much detailed
insight and understanding to the [[cooperative mechanisms]{.mark} and
outcomes of Arctic diplomacy]{.underline} that is largely separate from
the literature on co-management, the latter which [is]{.underline}
traditionally [viewed [through the lens of]{.mark}]{.underline} domestic
governance and the historic [[reconciliation]{.mark} between natives and

No matter the terminology, whether a "regional subsystem," a "regime,"
or a "borderland," the endurance of tribal polities and their
modernization and integration into the contemporary political geography
of Arctic North America suggests [we need a new "level of analysis" to
complete our structural map of world politics. I call this new level of
analysis the "fourth image"]{.underline} in both tribute and critique of
Kenneth Waltz's three classic levels of analysis that undergirds his
theory of neorealism. By the time states turned to the Arctic region for
their sovereign expansion, they did so less muscularly than they did in
other parts of the world, and this has enabled states to expand while
integrating northern indigenous peoples largely intact into their
evolving constitutional structures. The northern tranquility that
distinguished the Arctic region from so many other parts of the globe,
and which has led many to affirm their faith in the existence of an
enduring state of "[[Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Heininen, 2011; Käpylä and Mikkola, 2015) [that is predisposed to
cooperation, [owes much]{.mark} then [to the **domestic reconciliation**
of tribe and state]{.mark} that has taken place during this historic and
exemplary northward state expansion]{.underline} -- dialectically
[[catapulting the region]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond its earlier
dichotomous categorization as either a northern "frontier" or "homeland"
(Berger, 1977) so that in synthesis it has evolved [[to]{.mark} become
both frontier and homeland]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in this
symbiotic fusion to [[emerge as]{.underline}]{.mark} something
altogether new -- [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} distinctive,
[[hybrid]{.underline}]{.mark} level of analysis that owes its
legitimacy, historic endurance, and pacific international
[[environment]{.mark} to both tribe and state, and [whose **sovereign
duality** brings order to a land that might otherwise collapse into
**partisan conflict**]{.mark} as seen in other tribally governed regions
of the world]{.underline}. The [reason why sovereign duality brings
order]{.underline} to the Arctic [is its **mutuality of commitment** to
the development of]{.underline} hybrid systems of joint governance
systems that universally embrace the principle of
**[co-management]{.underline}** while defining the specific terms of
co-management locally. The subsequent post-land claims proliferation of
[co-management boards]{.underline} across Arctic North America, and the
limited geographical reach of each board (centered upon a single
indigenous polity), has created a complex new map of the Arctic which
requires granular knowledge to successfully navigate, and this
granularity presents significant challenges to government and business
entities, with [[**successful co-management**
depend]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [up[on]{.mark}]{.underline} both a [good
faith commitment to [a mutually beneficial **partnership** between tribe
and state]{.mark}]{.underline}, and a detailed knowledge of the human
terrain that is no less nuanced, nor less strategically important, than
that of the most hotly contested zones of insurgency and conflict.

#### Realist frameworks flip [neg]{.underline} and prove Arctic exceptionalism is still [viable]{.underline}\-\--the Arctic is not [separate]{.underline} from world politics but a [direct reflection]{.underline} of geopolitical dynamics.

**Zellen 24** \[Barry Scott Zellen is a research scholar specializing in
Arctic geopolitics, international relations, and the tribal foundations
of world order. 2024. "Arctic Exceptionalism", *Arctic Exceptionalism:
Cooperation in a Contested World*, pp 10-11\] 吳

But as my earlier work on realism in IR theory9 has observed, [[realism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} very much [misunderstood to be antithetical to
constructivism and critical theory, when]{.underline} in fact, [realism
[may be]{.mark}]{.underline} more fairly [[viewed as a
two-millennia-long tradition of constructivism in
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, what I call "constructive-realism," an
ideational response to the ubiquity of anarchy in world politics that
dates at least as far back to the ancient Greek polis. Thus [[Arctic
exceptionalism emerges from]{.mark} the very same "Great-Game" and
"[Hobbesian" dynamics that define international politics]{.mark}
worldwide, with]{.underline} both [imperial expansion]{.underline} into
the Arctic [and]{.underline} the arrival of [the Westphalian
state]{.underline} ([with its "Hobbesian zero-sum
approach"]{.underline}) [driving]{.underline} the emergence and
endurance of [Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}. States aspire to order
everywhere but find the world greatly lacking and insecurity the
regrettable result. [In the Arctic]{.underline}, however, [[geography,
climate, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the human [response to the region's
[remote austerity]{.mark} have]{.underline} more kindly cooperated,
[[enabl]{.mark}ing a [convergence of interests]{.mark} that is distinct
from what we find elsewhere in the world]{.underline}---[[positioning
the Arctic as]{.underline}]{.mark} not only a testing ground for new
international relations but [[a model for
application]{.underline}]{.mark}, with appropriate refinement and
customization, to other parts of the world, particularly the
"Non-Integrating Gap," where NATO was embroiled for two decades of
asymmetrical warfare.

[Much of what we think]{.underline} we understand [about
realism]{.underline} in world politics [breaks down increasingly with
distance from the Westphalian core]{.underline}, as states themselves
increasingly diverge from the Westphalian model with this distance. Thus
my view of Arctic exceptionalism, as consistent with and the by-product
of Arctic geopolitics and realism in international relations, aligns
with the view of Juha Käpylä and Harri Mikkola, also cited by
Lackenbauer and Dean, "that the [geographical and political
distance]{.underline} between the Arctic and the southern metropoles
that governed it [facilitated the characterization of 'a unique region
detached, and encapsulated, from global political dynamics, and thus
characterized primarily as an apolitical space of regional governance,
functional cooperation, and peaceful co-existence]{.underline}.'"10 In
fact, [what [we witness in the Arctic is]{.mark}]{.underline} less a
separation from world politics than [[a reflection]{.mark} of the
interplay [of world politics]{.mark}]{.underline} with Arctic geography,
yielding distinct regional dynamics no more detached from international
relations than other regions, of which there are many beyond the
Westphalian core.

Classical geopolitical theorist Halford J. Mackinder recognized this
when he organized world politics into the geographical regions of
Heartland, Inner Crescent, and Outer Crescent, along with his lesser
known Lenaland, a distinctly Arctic subregion of the world geopolitical
system. And similarly, Michael Bravo's "tidy explanation" (as described
by Lackenbauer and Dean) of Arctic exceptionalism "as a regional
security complex with its own, independent, political calculus that is
poorly explained by conventional realist theories of international
relations"11 suggests that [[Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}
is itself an exception from realist principles, when in fact, as I have
argued here, it [[is more aptly understood as]{.mark} a reflection of
[realism]{.mark} as filtered [through an Arctic
lens]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lackenbauer and Dean point out how such
[[efforts to define]{.mark} Arctic [exceptionalism as
separate]{.mark}]{.underline} from realism and its many power-political
features [[have rendered the concept vulnerable]{.mark} by divorcing it
unnecessarily from military history and the reality of political power,
which is as real in the Arctic as it is at the Westphalian
core]{.underline}, albeit in less centralized form and often more
salient at the tribal than the nation-state level. As they note,

By [marginalizing traditional military and security issues]{.underline},
the Arctic exceptionalism embedded in these articulations of an Arctic
security complex also [creates vulnerability in suggesting that the
reintroduction of defence considerations inherently undermines
them]{.underline}. Furthermore, by prescribing that the logic of
exceptionalism points to a certain type of regime predicated on liberal
institutionalism, we might overlook different ways that other
commentators---rooted in other schools of thought---also identify
"exceptional" characteristics to justify or explain national behaviour
and regional dynamics.12

3. Results and discussion

3.1. The similarities, synergies and differences between IK and SK

The conceptual framework highlighted those similarities between [IK and
SK systems that often embody principles of balance and
interconnectedness in finding a common solution.]{.underline} In
addition to improving the usefulness of knowledge across disciplines,
the [[integration of scientific and indigenous knowledge provides
revolutionary insights]{.mark} into knowledge system theory. It supports
theories [that highlight pluralism]{.mark}---accepting [different
epistemologies as equally valid]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Miller et al.,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib86)),
[[collaboration]{.mark}---promoting interdisciplinary and
[cross-cultural cooperation in the creation of
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline},ethics---concentrating on ethical issues
on intellectual property, [respect, and equity in the exchange of
knowledge]{.underline} ([Battiste,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib15)),
and sustainability---[[expanding]{.mark} the definition of
[sustainability]{.mark} to encompass ecological and technological wisdom
(]{.underline}[Nelson and Shilling,
2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib119)).
This integration is a paradigm shift that challenges academics to think
beyond conventional lines and examine how various knowledge systems
might cooperate and coexist for the benefit of all.

[[SK offers]{.mark} a deeper [understanding of context beyond local
levels]{.mark}, promoting local sustainability and cultural
survival]{.underline} ([Bohensky and Maru,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib22)).
Traditional ecological knowledge is distinguished by wisdom and respect,
while IK adherents reject Western philosophy\'s focus on truth, belief,
and worldview ([Long et al.,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib72), [Turner
et al.,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib144)).
[This highlights the importance of understanding and respecting
different perspectives in promoting sustainable development]{.underline}
([Maffie,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib74)).

Knowledge integration requires understanding the similarities and
differences between IK and SK ([Moller et al.,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib87), [Davis,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib32)).
Both are complementary or parallel, and differences can be addressed
through integrated approaches and common ground ([Berkes et al.,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib19), [Bohensky
and Maru,
2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib22)).
Indigenous communities, such as the Quechua people in the Peruvian
Andes, use traditional knowledge to maintain ancient terracing systems
that prevent soil erosion and ensure water conservation ([Tempini,
2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib136)).
These [[practices align with contemporary]{.mark} scientific approaches
to [conservation and sustainable]{.mark} land [management,]{.mark}
demonstrating the importance of understanding and integrating these
approaches]{.underline} ([Brondízio et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib24)).

Although certain IK-based techniques are like SK, the former is more
likely to be founded on key social dynamics. There are distinctions
between IK and SK, according to several sources. [Fabricius et al.
(2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib41),
for example, acknowledged the importance of IK in scientific evaluations
as a source of fine-grained, specific information regarding local
ecosystem services in locations where formal knowledge is lacking. Its
failure to adapt rapidly enough to accommodate changes in
socio-ecological systems, as well as its inclination to be irrelevant
outside of the local environment, was also mentioned ([Fabricius et al.,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib41)).
According to [Klubnikin et al.
(2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib64),
the conflict between IK and SK occurs because IK is fundamentally
scientific. After all, it is obtained through empirical, experimental,
and holistic approaches, whereas Western knowledge may be perceived as
restricted and unsophisticated in its approach ([Klubnikin et al.,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib64)).

[Diaz et al.
(2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib36) proposed
that Indigenous local knowledge (ILK) systems are validated,
implemented, questioned, and used within their validation procedures
([Hill et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib51)).
ILK systems are formed, owned, and managed by Indigenous people and
local communities through official and informal organizations ([Tengö et
al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib138); [Agrawal,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib3); [Berkes,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib18)).
Building synergies between ILK and SK systems is crucial for progressing
towards sustainable ecological governance at various scales ([Tengö et
al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib138); [Takeuchi,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib134); [Ulicsni
et al.,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib145)).
However, ILK has been separated from its cultural context, affecting its
original meaning and ability for validation, change, and adaptation
([Agrawal,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib3)).
[[Building synergies requires establishing trust]{.mark}, recognizing
differences and commonalities, [constructing common visions, and
co-producing knowledge]{.mark} and [practices through]{.mark} respectful
[collaborations]{.mark} that [represent all parties\' interests]{.mark}
and [encourage mutually beneficial outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}([Tengö et al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib138); [Johnson
et al.,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib61)).

[IK is recognized as [a crucial bridge for long-term
development]{.mark}]{.underline}, addressing factors beyond local
control and impacting local communities\' values and ambitions
([O'Flaherty et al.,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib97)).
[[Indigenous scientists]{.mark} who understand the importance of culture
in IK can [serve as a vital link]{.mark} in knowledge
integration]{.underline} ([Rotarangi and Russell,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib116)).
[Their substantial participation in relevant science activities [ensures
these values are realized]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [and Indigenous
scientists are familiar with both knowledge systems (]{.mark}[[Eamer,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib38)).

### Solvency\-\--China Cooperation\-\--2NC 

#### Prioritizing indigenous peoples is key to [US-China cooperation]{.underline}\-\--formal engagement is absent [now]{.underline} but the counterplan sets a [common direction]{.underline} for governance.

international law and international relations from the University of
Alberta, Canada and held a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the University's

and the United States in the Arctic: Exploring the Divergence and
Convergence of Interests*, pg 31\] 吳

[Another [area reflecting]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[common interests
of]{.mark} the [U.S. and China in the Arctic is]{.mark} their engagement
with the [indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both the U.S. and
China have formally and extensively recognized the impact that
commercial and military activity will have on the indigenous peoples of
the Arctic. Both have released goals of developing sustainable Arctic
tourism. For the U.S., approximately 18% of the Alaskan population are
indigenous. However, [there is [yet to be any]{.mark} evident, [formal
engagement]{.mark} between the U.S. and China over the Arctic's
indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

As a founding member of the Arctic Council and signatory to the 1996
Ottawa Declaration,162 which was signed in a meeting attended by senior
representatives of three Arctic indigenous organizations, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has agreed multiple times to
[acknowledg]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[and
respect]{.underline}]{.mark}ive [the [Arctic's indigenous
population]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Declaration on the Establishment
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}, for example, recognizes the
traditional knowledge of the indigenous people of the Arctic and
[ensures full consultation with and]{.underline} the full [involvement
of indigenous people and their communities]{.underline} and other
inhabitants of the Arctic. Furthermore, the U.S. through the Ottawa
Declaration itself stated that 'the involvement of the Arctic indigenous
communities and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in
particular issues of sustainable development and environmental
protection in the Arctic.'163

[[China's own Arctic Policy recognizes]{.underline}]{.mark} that
'\[[c]{.underline}\][ommerical [activities]{.mark} in the region [will
have considerable impact on]{.mark}]{.underline}...[the way of work and
[life of]{.mark} Arctic residents including the [indigenous
peoples]{.mark}']{.underline} and lists as one of its Basic Principles
on the Arctic that 'China will... respect its diverse social culture and
the historical traditions of the indigenous peoples.'164 [Respect and
[accommodation]{.mark} for indigenous peoples [is mentioned multiple
times]{.mark} throughout China's Arctic Policy]{.underline},
specifically in regard to preserving tradition and culture, preserving
the eco-environment, and developing responsible tourism.

Additionally, [China's overarching [push for governance change]{.mark}
in the Arctic]{.underline}---one that provides more voice to non-Arctic
states---[[includes a message]{.mark} that [indigenous peoples
should]{.mark} also [have]{.mark} an [equal stake]{.mark} in Arctic
governance; a message that Arctic states]{.underline} like Denmark and
their Nuuk population [have received well]{.underline}. With these
multiple promises made by both the United States and China, [it is
[reasonable to suggest]{.mark}]{.underline} that caring for and
[[addressing the]{.mark} concerns of the Arctic [indigenous]{.mark}
population [could be one clear]{.mark} convergence of
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [two sides could]{.mark}
readily [agree on and move forward]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Crisis?", The Arctic Institute,

吳

The Arctic, warming at nearly three times the global average, is a
glaring focal point for the U.S.-China climate change working group.
[Based on an existing history of bilateral collaborations, U.S.-China
scientific cooperation to tackle climate change in the Arctic is
achievable and can have meaningful benefits even in the face of mounting
hostilities]{.underline} between the two countries. This article focuses
on these countries as they are the two largest carbon dioxide emitters
and leaders in the production of knowledge -- as measured by the number
of scientific publications. There is likewise Chinese scientific
cooperation with other Arctic states.

What is China's role in the changing Arctic?

As the largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world, China is fulfilling
its responsibility to the rest of the world to contribute to global
knowledge on climate change. [China's rise as an industrial power has
produced black carbon emissions that have played a significant role in
the warming Arctic]{.underline}.2) Conversely, [China is affected by
changes in the Far North. The loss of sea ice and altered wind
circulation in the Arctic was found to contribute to China's
"airpocalypse]{.underline}" -- severe air pollution that hung over
eastern China for nearly a month in 2013. Scientists warn that the
warming Arctic will continue to have severe effects on China.3) The
climate crisis in the Arctic -- in the form of sea-level rise, loss of
sea ice, and rising ocean and air temperatures -- affects all countries
with no regard for national borders.

[The rapidly changing Arctic and the internationalization of "the Arctic
situation" form the rationale for Beijing's interests in the Far
North]{.underline}, according to documents published by China's State
Council Information Office.4) China has formalized its Arctic ambitions
with an [official Arctic Policy]{.underline} published [in
2018]{.underline} that outlines aims to develop infrastructure, shipping
routes, and energy extraction in the Far North. The document [declares
that China is ready to participate in Arctic governance and work with
other nations in scientific research, academic exchanges, and
environmental observation]{.underline}. "China will improve the capacity
and capability in scientific research on the Arctic \[and\] pursue a
deeper understanding and knowledge of the Arctic science ... so as to
create favorable conditions for mankind to better protect, develop, and
govern the Arctic."5)

However, [some scholars argue]{.underline} that [China's official
approach]{.underline} to polar research and emphasis on international
collaboration [is for symbolic reasons]{.underline}. Some analysts argue
that Chinese Arctic science is [meant to advance]{.underline} China's
strategic interests in the region which may ultimately include [a
military component]{.underline}.6) There is a concern that scientific
research serves a "dual purpose" and is a precursor to the development
of Arctic military technology. For example, Anne-Marie Brady points to
studies by Chinese academics examining the feasibility of Chinese
submarines navigating the Arctic.7)

Can Arctic states cooperate with China in understanding the Arctic if
China's Arctic intentions are still hotly debated?8) [Scientific
cooperation is still an important pursuit despite mounting hostilities
and suspicion. Working together on climate research can serve as a
stabilizer of uncertainty amid a shift in the global balance of
power]{.underline}. Chinese investments in land and infrastructure and
resource extraction are viewed suspiciously in Northern European states,
although China's scientific engagement has been positively
received.9) Rasmus Gjedssø Bertelsen writes, "\[T\]he Arctic states and
China have used science to integrate China into Arctic institutions and
build Sino-Arctic epistemic communities."10) An epistemic community is a
transnational expert network that shares and co-creates knowledge about
scientific problems and solutions. [Arctic science diplomacy can build
trust and produce valuable knowledge]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Climate\-\--2NC 

#### Involving indigenous peoples key to [combating climate change]{.underline}

**Hofschneider 23** \[11/16/23, Anita Hofschneider is a journalist
writing about climate change, the environment, and the Pacific region
for Grist's Indigenous Affairs desk, "Indigenous Self-Determination Is
Key Climate Solution in New Report," Yes Magazine,
https://www.yesmagazine.org/climate/2023/11/16/report-climate-change-indigenous\]MZ

Many [Indigenous communities also lack data on their flood
risk]{.underline}, a problem that [reflects]{.underline} broader
[climate-related data gaps for Native peoples]{.underline} that the
report repeatedly noted. Despite the input of hundreds of expert
collaborators, the report noted the absence of data on Indigenous
peoples, including missing maps of historical ancestral homelands in
American Samoa, [missing data on wildfire risks to the U.S's island
territories, and a broad lack of environmental data from Indian
Country]{.underline}. The absence of data, the authors noted, represents
a major systemic obstacle that impedes policymaking.

Similarly, the report found that local, state, [and [federal
governments]{.mark} often [don't do enough to involve Indigenous peoples
in climate change response planning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Native
communities that pursue such planning themselves are often hampered by
lack of funding and staffing. Even when money is available to [fund
[Indigenous-led projects]{.mark}]{.underline}, the money streams may not
be constructed in a way to be actually accessible. [[Renewable energy
projects]{.mark}, such as a wind farm]{.underline} pursued by the
Rosebud Sioux Nation, for example, have faced many challenges, including
inadequate funding, questions about ownership of infrastructure, and
bureaucratic hoops.

The report concludes that [[supporting Indigenous self-determination is
necessary]{.mark} to ensure Native communities' needs are
met]{.underline}, but also found that those efforts are undermined by
policies and institutions that uphold state, local, or federal policies
or prioritize the needs of the private sector.

"[The right to self-determination]{.underline} means Ind[igenous peoples
should be in the position to make decisions about how [to respond to
climate change]{.mark} in ways that meet community-defined
needs]{.underline} and aspirations," the report says.

Nationally[, [Native people lead more than 1,000 efforts to address
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [drawing up [hundreds of climate
change]{.mark} adaptation and [mitigation plans]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
Washington state, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community cultivates clam
gardens to fight ocean acidification; in California, the Karuk Tribe has
fought for their right to conduct prescribed burns.

### Solvency\-\--Energy\-\--2NC

[**[In]{.mark} the context of [the global rush to decarbonize]{.mark},
participatory [processes of]{.mark} community [consultation and
consent]{.mark} [receive]{.mark}d [heightened importance]{.mark} and
urgency**. Meaningful consultation and consent are crucial to balancing
power relations between governments, industry and affected
communities]{.underline}. [**[Despite]{.mark}** an unprecedented
**[recognition of Indigenous peoples\' rights]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
their role in just energy transitions, [**[complex challenges]{.mark}
continue to [characterize consultation]{.mark}** and consent driven by
states and companies]{.underline}. Based on an integrative narrative and
case review of over 100 academic articles, we have identified
limitations of company- and state-led consultation and consent
[**[across the]{.mark}** circumpolar **[north]{.mark}**]{.underline},
with common categories being: inadequate procedures or frameworks for
consultation; unclear legal frameworks and gaps; weak relationships and
distrust between Indigenous communities, state and industry; cultural
disconnect; and asymmetries in power, knowledge, and decision-making
authority. They clearly speak to key components of just energy
transitions for Indigenous peoples, as conceptualized by Rioux-Gobeil
and Thomassin to include justice for Indigenous knowledge renewal and
procedural power \[22\]. [**[Many]{.mark}** of these **[limitations are
structural]{.mark}, rooted in colonial legacies**, top-down and
centralized decision-making, **and neoliberal economic systems**. These
limitations are also relational]{.underline}, stemming from insufficient
efforts, resourcing, and lack of trust-building relationships. [**As
[cases from the circumpolar north illustrate, each]{.mark} community
[experience is unique]{.mark}**[, **given**]{.mark} the local
complexities of histories, cultural practices, political contexts, and
**[resources that Indigenous peoples have]{.mark} at their disposal to
engage**]{.underline} meaningfully. **[[Only a]{.mark} [few cases
documented positive]{.mark} community experiences of
[consultation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and consent, reflecting common bias
in academic literature to focus on problematic cases. While many of the
reviewed studies focus on the lack of Indigenous capacity and ability to
engage, other studies discuss activism and resistance to colonial and
extractive structures that increasingly impact on resource
decision-making \[13,40\]. A lack of or insufficient consultation and
consent has been attributed to legal disputes and project cancelations.
In conflict situations of complex, prolonged, epistemic and value-based
disagreements, the opportunity to object and seek remedies is important,
however Indigenous people question whether these are sufficient to
enable equitable decision-making. In northern Fennoscandia and northern
Canada, [**[Indigenous peoples are taking to court]{.mark} energy and
mining [companies]{.mark} and governments [for violation of their
rights]{.mark}**, including the right to FPIC, with mixed
outcomes]{.underline} \[33,84,141\]. [**However, [even in]{.mark} the
case of legal [victories, there are]{.mark} [no]{.mark} clear
[implications for future projects]{.mark}** questioning the fairness of
the ongoing transitions]{.underline} \[84\]. Some argue that [conflicts
can represent an opportunity for re-framing conventional approaches in
democratic societies]{.underline}, generating novel spaces for systemic
change towards sustainability and equity \[38,117\].
[**[Achieving]{.mark} justice in [energy transitions requires]{.mark}**
not only changes in technology or regulations]{.underline}. Enabling
just energy transitions [necessitates **a [redefinition of]{.mark}
governance and [norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} that enable deep structural
and relational changes **[[so]{.mark} that [Indigenous]{.mark} and
land-connected [people control development on their lands]{.mark} on
their own terms]{.underline}** \[57\]. [Across circumpolar
countries]{.underline}, advances in jurisprudence and Indigenous
peoples\' assertion of their rights have influenced governments,
companies, right-holders and stakeholders to [start re-envisioning,
reviewing, and redesigning norms and approaches to consultation and
consent]{.underline}. The scope of these initiatives is broader than the
narrow legal definitions of the "duty to consult" \[89\], which "appears
to mostly enable, rather than impede, the expansion of colonial and
capitalist social relations" \[84\]. Increasingly, communities are
negotiating access to the lands they own, manage and use, generating
some level of control. Cases in Canada demonstrate Indigenous-led and
Indigenous-centred decision-making that leverages the UNDRIP and
treaties to define and control the decision-making processes, including
through Indigenous-led impact assessments and Indigenous-co-ownership
arrangements. [However, as cases have demonstrated, **[the Sámi]{.mark}
across the Sápmi [have less leverage to influence
decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the paper, we provided a
nuanced understanding of transitions in governance across the Arctic and
sub-Arctic regions \[142\], focussing on Indigenous-centred
decision-making. We differentiated Indigenous-benefiting and
Indigenous-informed from Indigenous-led approaches, with the key
difference being in the level of leadership and agency of Indigenous
peoples. Indigenous-led approaches recognise that Indigenous
land-connected communities are not just stakeholders, they are
rightsholders as well as leaders and managers. Indigenous nations should
be considered as self-determining entities, without imposing unilateral
processes \[86\]. This is the key principle of Indigenous-led FPIC, as
per recent guidelines developed by the Securing Indigenous Peoples\'
Rights in the Green Economy (SIRGE) Coalition \[143\]. While governments
and companies are seeking to strengthen and multiply participatory
channels for meaningful community engagement in decision-making, new
initiatives in governance and management with direct participation of
Indigenous peoples point to promising avenues for justice and equity in
transition processes, however, challenges remain. In the paper[, we
identified **[barriers]{.mark} to Indigenous-centered decision-making
[including lack of recognition]{.mark} and integration of Indigenous
peoples\' rights**, Indigenous representation and internal
decision-making, **and formal legal and regulatory
constraints**]{.underline}. Furthermore, critical literature on
Indigenous rights and consultation and consent cautions to be aware of
different power effects these initiatives might entail beyond their
stated aims \[144\], as several studies argue that [norms with an
"emancipatory and reconciliation potential" can ultimately lead to
disempowering processes when their meaning is curtailed]{.underline}
\[145\]. This is because Indigenous-informed, Indigenous-benefiting and
many Indigenous-led approaches, whilst aiming to ensure Indigenous
peoples are active participants in decision-making, are based on formal
and patronized decision-making processes which are institutionalised
within top-down legal, regulatory, and corporate systems. **[[While
advances have been reported]{.mark} in the circumpolar context, [more
needs to be done]{.mark} for re-centering Indigenous-led decision-making
for just energy transitions]{.underline}**. Some of the key lessons
learnt from our review are: 1. Prioritizing trust and relationships.
Meaningful decision-making moves at "the speed of trust" and
communication and transparency are critical to developing and sustaining
collaborations and partnerships. 2. Indigenous-centred and led
approaches are based on not only capacity and leadership of Indigenous
people, but more so on the capacity of institutions and organisations.
Building institutional capacities must be driven by clearly defined
visions, values and practices and align with Indigenous-centred
priorities and approaches. 3. It is important to establish a shared
understanding of definitions and meanings of terms such as 'consent',
'dialogue', and 'benefit-sharing', as they can vary significantly and
can be loaded with negative meanings. The concept 'Indigenous-led' can
be exploited to get access to land and resources. 4. Enabling
Indigenous-centred decision-making requires access to resources and
support including capital, technical and legal expertise, infrastructure
and time. Sufficient resourcing is needed to meaningfully engage and
negotiate as well as fulfill cultural responsibilities and rights. 5. To
be of value to Indigenous people, consultation and consent should
incorporate the recognition of a 'no' as a valuable outcome of
consultation. Furthermore, conditions for consent are not static and are
subject to renegotiation, [in particular, in the context of the shifting
(re-)assertion of Indigenous rights and self-determination, emphasizing
the need for ongoing dialogue]{.underline}. 6. Finally, just transition
hinges upon the recognition of Indigenous rights, self-determination and
economic reconciliation. Research highlights the importance of
restorative justice and truth-telling about the profound impacts of
colonisation on Indigenous peoples across generations to enable
equitable consultation and consent. Overall, we suggest that [**securing
just energy transition calls for [a shift in the practices of community
consultation]{.mark}** and consent that embeds processes and norms that
uphold the rights, interests, knowledges, and values of Indigenous
peoples and land-connected communities]{.underline}. Further research
should continue to document and critically examine community
consultation and consent focusing on practices that genuinely value and
embed Indigenous perspectives. In particular, there is a need for a
wider range of academic analysis that includes both cautionary and
positive examples of community engagement as well as resistance
\[65,146\]. Such contributions are important for advancing research and
understanding of justice in the context of energy transitions that
incorporate the rights and perspectives of Indigenous and land-connected
peoples \[22,147\].

[[Oil and Gas Operations]{.mark} Fund Infrastructure [in]{.mark} Rural
[Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Our budget every single year is absolutely tied to the kinds of revenue
that we get from the price of oil, " said Dr. A.L. Lovecraft, professor
of Political Science and director of the Center for Arctic Policy
Studies at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

[Ninety-five percent of the North Slope Borough's budget comes [from
taxation on development infrastructure on the oil and gas
industry](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/climate/willow-alaska-oil-biden.html#:~:text=Image,Directions%20to%20the%20ice%20road.).]{.underline}

According to a [[2024 Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
report]{.underline}](https://www.blm.gov/about/data/socioeconomic-impact-report),
oil and gas operations contributed to almost \$1.4 billion in economic
output on Alaska's BLM-managed lands, accounting for 81% of total
economic output generated on federal land. Meanwhile, recreation on BLM
land accounted for about 3% of total economic output, or \$48.1 million.

In the North Slope Borough, [[oil and gas extraction [made up
48%]{.mark}](https://headwaterseconomics.org/apps/economic-profile-system/2185)[ of
all employment]{.mark} in 2023]{.underline}, compared to about 1.4% of
employment in the rest of non-metro counties in the United States,
according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data
by [[Headwaters
Economics]{.underline}](https://headwaterseconomics.org/about/), a
nonprofit research organization.

But most of those jobs are filled by transient workers, not natives of
the North Slope. The [[majority of full-time North Slope
residents]{.underline}](https://www.north-slope.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/13_Economic_Development_-_NSB_Comprehensive_Plan.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) work
for the local government.

However, [Alaska's oil and gas industry [provides opportunities beyond
direct employment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Lovecraft mentioned hiring a student research assistant through an
internship funded by the [[Arctic Slope Regional
Corporation ]{.underline}](https://www.asrc.com/)(ASRC), one of twelve
regional corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act of
1971]{.underline}](https://www.blm.gov/programs/lands-and-realty/regional-information/alaska/land_transfer/ancsa).

Unlike reservations in the lower 48, [Alaskan [Natives have regional
corporations like]{.mark} the [ASRC.]{.mark}]{.underline} These
corporations operate like traditional businesses, [[benefiting]{.mark}
their [shareholders]{.mark}---who are Alaskan [Native
peoples]{.mark}---[by generating revenue from]{.mark} industries such as
[oil and gas.]{.mark}]{.underline} Currently, the [[ASRC has over 13,000
shareholders]{.underline}]{.mark} who receive dividends. Since its
establishment in 1972, the ASRC has [[distributed more than \$1
billion]{.mark} in [dividends.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Many [leaders of [the Iñupiat]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} an
indigenous people [[native to Alaska]{.mark}'s North Slope Borough, [say
that oil and gas]{.mark} operations [can be good for native communities
if conducted responsibly.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[Before oil and gas, you couldn't graduate high school]{.underline} and
stay in the North Slope," said [[Nagruk
Harcharek]{.underline}](https://usea.org/profile/nagruk-harcharek),
president of the [[Voice of the Arctic
Iñupiat]{.underline}](https://www.asrc.com/issues/voice-of-the-arctic-inupiat/),
a nonprofit organization that advocates for Alaska's Iñupiat people.
"[Now there's K-12 schools in every North Slope village."]{.underline}

Harcharek [[credited revenue]{.mark} from the oil and gas industry [with
funding]{.mark} the establishment of [search and rescue teams and
improving home heating]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline} But
regardless of the oil and gas industry's potential benefits to his
community, [he [emphasized the importance of having a seat at the
table]{.mark} where decisions about their land are made, [rather than
being sidelined by]{.mark} oil [executives and]{.mark} presidential
[administrations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["We don't want to hear about things through the news
media,"]{.underline} said Harcharek. He said [they [want to be included
before decisions are announced publicly.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Harcharek said that [the controversial [[Willow
Project]{.mark}](https://www.conocophillips.com/operations/alaska/willow-project/)]{.underline},
a ConocoPhillips drilling project in the North Slope, [west of ANWR,
[was a good example of]{.mark} what it looks like to [engage Alaskan
Natives.]{.mark} He said they were consulted "early and often" in the
decision-making process.]{.underline}

\[paragraph breaks removed\]

The Risks of Drilling in the Arctic Drilling in the Arctic raises
significant environmental concerns, including the acceleration of
climate change and potential disruption to vulnerable wildlife. It can
also be costly due to short work seasons and limited existing
infrastructure. And according to [[climate data from
NOAA]{.underline}](https://www.uaf.edu/caps/our-work/CAPS-alaskas-climate-policy-development-report-29April2021.pdf),
temperature has increased more in Alaska's North Slope Borough compared
to any other region in the state since 1970. That, in turn, has
destabilized ice, [[making snowmobile travel more
hazardous]{.underline}](https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-connections-alaska-dogsledding-and-iditarod).
In a state twice the size of Texas with only [[700,000 residents spread
across approximately 200
communities,]{.underline}](https://ancsaregional.com/the-twelve-regions/)
snowmobiles are often one of the few viable modes of transportation in
remote areas. Parts of the North Slope Borough are also important
breeding and hunting grounds for caribou. And some Alaskan Natives worry
about how [[devastating oil spills
will]{.underline}](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03042019/arctic-offshore-drilling-ruling-alaska-native-subsistence-hunters-whaling-oil-gas-trump-administration/)
disrupt migration patterns and harm traditional ways of life. Other
Alaskans are concerned that climate change will melt ice and the
permafrost, [[leading to hazardous hunting
conditions]{.underline}](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/aps-22-1-6.htm#:~:text=With%20warming%20temperatures%2C%20early%20breakup,of%20traditional%20foods%20more%20difficult.)
as individuals risk falling through the ice and face [[challenges
storing food in traditional underground ice
cellars]{.underline}](https://www.uaf.edu/caps/our-work/CAPS-alaskas-climate-policy-development-report-29April2021.pdf).
"The indigenous population in these villages rely on subsistence
practices," said Lovecraft. "Both to be physically healthy, and of
course to ensure that language and culture continue." Hunting is more
than just a hobby in many native villages with high poverty rates.
Hunting is a method of survival, said Lovecraft. "\[Drilling\] also
comes with all of this other baggage... Problems related to health,
indoor health, indoor air quality, outdoor air quality." The air toxins
released during oil and gas activity include chemicals like benzene and
n-hexane, which are thought to cause cancer and cause other health
conditions, [[according to the
EPA]{.underline}](https://www.epa.gov/controlling-air-pollution-oil-and-natural-gas-operations/basic-information-about-oil-and-natural#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20helping%20form,and%20other%20serious%20health%20effects.).
Arctic Drilling is Costly But the costs of oil and gas drilling in the
Arctic are not solely environmental; they also include significant
economic challenges. Despite Trump's "Drill Baby, Drill" attitude, the
success of Arctic drilling depends less on Republican policies and more
on the global price of oil---a complex and fluctuating factor beyond the
president-elect's direct control. Many arctic oil exploration sites
don't have existing infrastructure like permanent roads or nearby oil
and gas pipelines. Building out the necessary infrastructure can be cost
prohibitive if the global price of oil isn't high enough to make it
worth the investment, according to Montgomery. [[Much of this
infrastructure can only be established in the
winter]{.underline}](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/14/politics/willow-project-oil-alaska-explained-climate/index.html#:~:text=Environmental%20groups%20and%20ConocoPhillips%20are,could%20end%20sometime%20in%20April.),
as ice roads are required to transport materials. A [[2024 brief from

estimated that oil prices need to be between \$63 and \$84 per barrel to
be worth the costly investment. But the latest data from the [[Energy
Information
Administration]{.underline}](https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/spot_prices.php)
predicted that the price of oil per barrel will hover around \$61 to
\$63 per barrel in 2025. The Trump Administration's first lease sale in
2021 didn't [[attract much
interest]{.underline}](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/turns-out-oil-industry-wasn-t-interested-arctic-refuge-after-all).
Only 11 of the 22 tracts available received any bids. That sale took
place during the pandemic, a period marked [[by historically low oil
prices---approximately \$56 per
barrel]{.underline}](https://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/crudeoil/spot_prices.php),
according to the Energy Information Administration. In December 2024,
the price was \$61, still modest compared to the \$172 per barrel at the
twenty-year high in 2008. Montgomery said he thinks there will be small,
if any, interest in the upcoming January 9th lease auction. "But I think
there might be a few companies that would take the bait," he said.
According to Montgomery, some companies might sit on the lease until oil
prices improve before they start drilling procedures. With any bids that
do take place on January 9th, Harcharek hopes that the Iñupiat will be
heard and included. "We get characterized as oil and gas advocates but
that's not the truth," he said.

made on their land]{.mark}. It just so happens that right now, those
profits are [coming from the oil and gas industry.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

5.2.2. Indigenous-centred consultation and consent

In this section, we discuss approaches that support Indigenous-centred
decision-making, using the conceptual framework of Indigenous-informed,
Indigenous-benefiting, and Indigenous-led approaches introduced in
section 2. We analyse how these approaches uphold Indigenous peoples\'
rights, knowledges, interests, and values, and address procedural
injustices arising from limitations of company- and state-led
consultation and consent, presented in the previous subsection.

5.2.2.1. Indigenous-informed

In Canada, the Eleonore mine reclamation process incorporating Cree
Indigenous knowledge highlights the adoption of a ["co-design"
[Indigenous-informed approach]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[130]{.underline}\]. Several advantages were identified, including
[complementarity (rather than [integration) of traditional ecological
knowledge]{.mark} to Western science, taking into account Indigenous
concerns over the long-term impacts, [and inclusion of Indigenous
peoples\' priorities in]{.mark} post-mine [land use
planning]{.mark}]{.underline} [\[]{.mark}[130]{.underline}\]. In the
case of the Raglan nickel mine in Nunavik, the Inuit communities
informed an impact assessment, [[facilitat]{.mark}ing more [meaningful
engagement]{.mark} and providing [an opportunity "to]{.mark} integrate
cultural information, [revise the project, co-develop
mitigations]{.mark} and monitoring measures]{.underline}, and jointly
define levels of significance for each impact after mitigation and
eventually settle on a decision" \[[74]{.underline}\]. In Nunavut,
[corporate-led [community engagement]{.mark} during the environmental
impact assessment [for]{.mark} the Back River [mine included traditional
knowledge]{.mark} of caribou, [significantly influencing]{.mark}
community experience of engagement and [project
design]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[73]{.underline}\]. In the Northwest
Territories, [ongoing initiatives integrate Indigenous knowledge in mine
site remediation, ensuring community engagement is informed and
integrates Indigenous values \[]{.underline}[87\].]{.underline}

In Greenland, there has been a growing interest in [incorporating
traditional knowledge in the environmental impact assessment
process]{.underline}. However, as Dahl and Hansen \[[131]{.underline}\]
show based on a review of three environmental impact assessment reports,
the level of influence of Indigenous knowledge was low and with no
significant impact on the project assessment, project design, or
mitigation measures concerning issues identified by Indigenous peoples.
However, other studies suggest that the [[incorporation of Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark} in impact assessment and project planning [provides an
opportunity to account for]{.mark} the totality of [livelihood impacts,
complexity of]{.mark} northern [mixed economies,]{.mark} [energy]{.mark}
poverty, [gender]{.mark} hierarchies[, and other intersecting
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[89]{.underline}\] as well as help to
[[build trust,]{.mark} improve dialogue [and enhance communication
during consultation]{.mark} procedures \[121\].]{.underline}

5.2.2.3. Indigenous-led

Across the circumpolar north[, [literature provides examples of
Indigenous-led]{.mark} community-based [environmental monitoring]{.mark}
initiatives.]{.underline} Herrmann et al. \[[121]{.underline}\]
documented examples [where [Sámi people]{.mark} in Sweden and First
Nations in Canada [utilise GIS]{.mark} (geographic information systems)
[and field data to]{.mark} support community-led [monitor]{.mark}ing of
[mine impacts]{.mark} on habitat and animal populations]{.underline}.
Jääskeläinen \[[125]{.underline}\] highlights the importance of
developing [[Indigenous-led metrics and tools]{.mark} that [allow
ontological multiplicity]{.mark} which is [crucial for
evaluating]{.mark} the [sustainability of industrial projects]{.mark}
based on Indigenous perspectives.]{.underline} For Bjørgo and Bay-Larsen
\[[102]{.underline}\], community-led assessments should have an
interdisciplinary approach and include marginal actors,
[[providing]{.mark} more holistic [insights into]{.mark} the [complex
issues]{.mark} of economic, social, and environmental
development.]{.underline}

[[Another example of Indigenous-led decision-making is]{.mark} the [Red
Dog mine in Alask]{.mark}a]{.underline} operated by an agreement between
Teck Alaska Inc. and the landowner NANA, which is a Native corporation
owned by the Iñupiat people. NANA [leaders are [actively involved
in]{.mark}]{.underline} managing the mine as part of the committee,
[focusing on [environmental monitoring]{.mark} and monitoring
subsistence concerns]{.underline} \[[114]{.underline}\]. Furthermore,
the [[Nunavut Impact Review Board in Canada enables]{.mark}]{.underline}
the participation of Inuit communities in decision-making, e.g., through
evaluating projects for the inclusion of traditional knowledge
\[[74]{.underline}\]. Indigenous-led initiatives provide [[the ability
to control processes]{.mark} in accordance [with self-determined]{.mark}
priorities and [values]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[134]{.underline}\].
[Indigenous-led assessment process [offers]{.mark} "opportunities for
operationalizing [reconciliation,]{.mark} [consent-based
processes]{.mark}, and more [respectful relationships]{.mark} between
Indigenous communities and the state" as well as increases [respect for
traditional knowledge

\[https://www.cgc.gc.ca/publications/icebreaking-deglacage/requirements-besoins/index-eng.html?

The [Canadian Coast Guard ([CCG]{.mark}]{.underline}) has
[[conducted]{.mark} engagement [sessions with]{.mark} both
[Indigenous]{.mark} and industry [rep]{.mark}resentative[s]{.mark}
[along]{.mark} Canada's [coast line]{.mark}]{.underline}, where [ice is
present, to develop]{.underline} the 2023-2028 Client [Icebreaking

[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} is a [[crucial component]{.mark} for
the [delivery of]{.mark} [icebreaking services]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Their [[input]{.mark} helps [guide]{.mark}]{.underline} how [icebreaking
[resources and assets]{.mark}]{.underline} are organized.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} is [important as the CCG has finite
resources]{.underline} that [must be efficiently deployed to [support
navigation]{.mark}]{.underline} through [ice covered waters and marine
commerce]{.underline}. The [Client Icebreaking Requirements compiles
information]{.underline} gathered [from engagement sessions,
provides]{.underline} a CCG response, and [contains the CCG block
commitments.]{.underline}

The [20[17-22]{.mark} Icebreaker [Requirements]{.mark} document
[outlines]{.mark}]{.underline} the [needs and [priorities of]{.mark}
industry [stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[summarizes]{.mark} the
Canadian [Coast Guard's]{.mark}]{.underline} (CCG) [Icebreaking
[Services' capacity]{.mark} and planning with regards to these
priorities.]{.underline} The [document]{.underline} is [revisited every
five years to [reflect]{.mark} changing environmental, economic, and
capacity factors]{.underline}. Through [2022 and part of 2023, CCG
engaged with both industry representatives and [Indigenous communities,
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [best of CCG's abilities]{.underline}, to
[learn what they wanted from Icebreaking Services. Both
groups]{.underline} were [able to [question]{.mark}, analyze, [inform,
suggest changes]{.mark} to existing services]{.underline}, and [[propose
new aspects]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [input gathered]{.underline} will
[inform future fleet deployments]{.underline}, in-season [fleet
organization]{.underline}, and [[facilitate new]{.mark} and on-going
[Indigenous]{.mark} and industry [engagement]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the [majority of engagement sessions, respondents]{.underline}
requested [additional icebreaking assets]{.underline}. Other topics of
interest were performance reporting transparency, alterations to
existing deployment dates, and collaboration with the United States
Coast Guard, to name a few. [Indigenous communities were included in
this process for the first time. During [Indigenous]{.mark} engagement
[sessions]{.mark}]{.underline}, attendees [familiarized themselves
with]{.underline} the [program]{.underline} and its services, and
[[built new relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}. [CCG looks forward to
working with these groups in the future [and]{.mark} learning about
their [perspectives on icebreaking]{.mark} services.]{.underline} For
all of these sessions, CCG produced What We Heard (WWH) documents for
each region. Below are summaries of each region's sessions and the
complete WWHs can be found in the annex.

Unfortunately, the [Icebreaking Services was not able to engage with
Arctic Indigenous communities.]{.underline} For the Arctic region,
[engagement guidelines require that all engagement requests are brought
to regional governance tables before having focused one-on-one meetings
with Inuit, First Nation or Métis partners]{.underline}. Due to capacity
challenges, none of the regional governance tables were able to be
conducted within the timeframe of our engagement for the Icebreaker
Requirements. However, the [[Arctic Region]{.mark} in [collaboration
with]{.mark} the [Ice Office maintains]{.mark} an [open]{.mark} line of
[communication with Indigenous groups in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} and
the region and may provide answers or direct feedback]{.underline} when
required. [CCG is]{.underline} committed to [working with Arctic
Indigenous communities]{.underline}.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The [Canadian Coast Guard Ship]{.underline} Amundsen is Canada's [only
dedicated [research icebreaker]{.mark}, conducting annual scientific
expeditions in]{.underline} the [Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
since 2003]{.underline}. Amundsen Science coordinates the expeditions
and provides financial, logistical, and technical support to user
programs from academic, public, private, and nonprofit sectors. In [20
years of operations, more than 1,850 individuals, researchers, students,
and professionals have boarded the vessel]{.underline} (often more than
once) to conduct their research programs. [During]{.underline} a
[typical science mission]{.underline}, the [Amundsen holds 80
passengers, comprised of 40 Coast Guard crew members and 40
scientists]{.underline}, thus creating a true microcosm within which
building an equitable, diverse, and inclusive work environment is
crucial. The [scientific contingent [includes]{.mark} a [strong
proportion of]{.mark} students (30%--40%), young [professionals,
and]{.mark} early [career scientists]{.mark}, among whom approximatively
40%--50% identify as women. Amundsen Science is thus committed to
implementing effective preventive measures and training that promote a
social work environment free of bullying and harassment]{.underline}
(e.g., Österman and Boström, 2022). In [addition,
[given]{.mark}]{.underline} the [inherent [Arctic mandate]{.mark} of
CCGS Amundsen as it sails in Inuit Nunangat territories, [there
is]{.mark} a [strong need to bridge Indigenous and science]{.mark}-based
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tengö et al., 2014; Alexander et al.,
2019).

Native Alaskans represent approximately 15 percent of the total
population of Alaska, with more than 110,000 people.22 This population
is distributed across more than 225 communities, speaking more than 20
languages, and classified into five ethnic groups. Many of these
communities exist along the western and northern coasts of Alaska, along
the Bering Strait and the Arctic Ocean, and comprise the largest
percentage of military veterans per capita among all US demographics.23
[Numerous [Indigenous communities have]{.mark} poor or [failing
infrastructure]{.mark}, are isolated from the rest of the state, and are
a prime target for malign actors seeking to undermine the United
States]{.underline}. The severe [lack of infrastructure [represents an
opportunity for adverse influence by]{.mark}]{.underline} our
[[strategic competitors]{.underline}]{.mark} and a reciprocal
opportunity for the US DOD. [[Investing in indigenous]{.mark} Alaskan
[communities]{.mark} is a chance to [deny competitor influence]{.mark},
[rebuild trust]{.mark} with Native Alaskan communities while
establishing]{.underline} multiuse [infrastructure with multi-domain
effects]{.underline}, [[and increase]{.mark} our [military's Arctic
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}. As US Senator Lisa Murkowski (R--AK)
recently stated,

Infrastructure is one of the foundations of modern society, impacting
everything from food security, health care, education, commerce, and our
ability to operate militarily. It is no different in the High North.
However, in many parts of the Arctic, infrastructure is often poor or
simply non-existent, which is detrimental and unfair to its residents,
and should be unacceptable to us as an Arctic nation.24

These communities, accessible almost exclusively by air or sea, fit
squarely into Senator Murkowski's diagnosis and are precisely the
environments in which ARSOF units thrive. The US government's force of
choice for operating through or with Indigenous populations is Army
Special Forces, more commonly known as Green Berets. [Working with
Indigenous populations is the cornerstone of Special
Forces]{.underline}. Since their inception in 1952, Green Berets have
conducted these types of missions worldwide to achieve US national
security objectives.

[[ARSOF]{.mark} can [engage with]{.mark} Alaskan [Natives]{.mark} to
leverage their ability [to act as]{.mark} local [eyes and ears in
support of]{.mark} US [national security]{.mark},
[while]{.mark}]{.underline} simultaneously [[learning how to
survive]{.mark} and operate in some of the harshest conditions in the
world. This]{.underline} role could be the beginning of a potential
redux of the Alaskan Scout program, focused on [increas]{.underline}ing
[domain awareness]{.underline}, [deter]{.underline}ring [malign actors
in the homeland, and strengthening the relationship between the
government and these populations. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} reciprocal
relationship of an Indigenous approach [would not only strengthen US
national security]{.underline} and assist in rebuilding military Arctic
capability [but]{.underline} could [[also]{.mark} help [address critical
infrastructure issues]{.mark} in these communities.]{.underline}

At its least ambitious level, the Indigenous approach would leverage the
environmental and survival knowledge that is resident in Native Alaskan
communities. This [[basic]{.mark} survival [knowledge]{.mark} would go a
long way toward [rebuild]{.mark}ing the [foundational
skills]{.mark}]{.underline} that [ARSOF operators will need]{.underline}
to operate in an Arctic environment. Today, ARSOF forces are not manned,
trained, or equipped to survive, compete, and dominate in this or
similar environments. [Things as simple as how to conduct [route
planning]{.mark}, types of [equipment]{.mark} to bring, movement over
[terrain, and medical care]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic [[are
things]{.mark} that [Indigenous communities have]{.mark} developed and
[mastered]{.mark} over centuries]{.underline}; [yet]{.underline},
outside of individual efforts, [[that]{.mark} experience [has not been
translated into military TTPs]{.mark}]{.underline} or standard operating
procedures (SOP). Nor has it been widely integrated into the Alaskan
National Guard, whose footprint has been reduced to a presence mostly
concentrated around Anchorage and Juneau.

#### Indigenous alignment guarantees [democratic supremacy]{.underline} in the Arctic\-\--Russia and China are [ramping up]{.underline} influence which means partnership [now]{.underline} is [key]{.underline}.

**Zellen 21** \[Barry Scott Zellen is a research scholar specializing in
Arctic geopolitics, international relations, and the tribal foundations
of world order. "Arctic Indigenous Peoples and the State: Toward a
Universal Convergence of Arctic Reconciliation", *Arctic Yearbook 2021*,
pp 4-5\] 吳

Intriguingly, [the strengthening [alignment of]{.mark} interests between
[Indigenous peoples and]{.mark} their [sovereign
states]{.mark}]{.underline} across the non-Russian Arctic from Alaska to
Finland [[may provide]{.mark} the [democratic Arctic with an]{.mark}
inherent [advantage over Russia]{.mark}, whose own native peoples remain
marginalized]{.underline}, their lands and resources encroached upon or
expropriated, and many of their leaders either exiled or effectively
marginalized (Nilsen, 2019; Balzer, 2021). [One can even imagine the
democratic Arctic states [mastering]{.mark} in turn the art of [hybrid
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} if a future Arctic Cold War intensifies,
just as many of them by necessity re-mastered the art of
counterinsurgency (COIN) warfare during the long GWOT -- [including
Human Terrain Mapping]{.underline} (HTM), [which became central to U.S.
strategy during its many battles to win Indigenous hearts and
minds]{.underline} in multiple theatres of operations, [and which
defined the political orders imposed on post-conflict countries
throughout that conflict]{.underline} (Zellen, 2012) -- [and
by]{.underline} confidently and proactively [[turning the tables on
Moscow, winning]{.underline}]{.mark} the battle for the hearts and minds
of [[Russia's own]{.mark} oppressed [native
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, a process already underway to a limited
degree with the warm diplomatic reception enjoyed by Russian Indigenous
leaders in Arctic governing institutions like the Arctic Council where
Arctic Indigenous organizations enjoy a distinct membership status as
Permanent Participants, second only to the founding member states (the
A8), and superior in organizational status to the many observer
organizations and states, among which China is included.

One can even cautiously hope that [[Russia may]{.mark} come to
[realize]{.mark} that its [security can be]{.mark} best [strengthened by
achieving parity]{.mark} with its democratic counterparts on the Arctic
Council [in]{.mark} the area of [Indigenous rights]{.mark} and
empowerment. This]{.underline} may in fact be under way and [could
[explain]{.mark} the notable [prominence of Indigenous issues in]{.mark}
Russia's [latest]{.mark} Arctic [policy update]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Office of the President of the Russian Federation, 2020). [It could
also explain]{.underline} some interesting but little reported
pronouncements by Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} several years ago
[recognizing the Ainu people]{.underline} (whose homeland, since World
War II's end, has been partitioned by Russia and Japan) [as Indigenous
to Russia]{.underline}, catching the attention of Tokyo, where Ainu
recognition has been advancing at an incremental pace, suggesting a
potential diplomatic advantage of a more pro-active approach by Moscow
on Ainu rights issues. [Engaging in the battle for [influence of]{.mark}
the [Indigenous]{.mark} Arctic human [terrain could]{.mark} thus [be to
Russia's advantage]{.mark}, helping to neutralize its]{.underline}
diplomatic and political [vulnerability on this issue vis-à-vis the
West. In so doing]{.underline}, [the inter-Arctic collaborative dynamic
would also be strengthened]{.underline}, further neutralizing any risk
associated with the increasingly competitive strategic triangularity
described above.

With its deep pockets, [[China may]{.mark} take the opportunity to
retool its approach]{.underline}, shifting further away from "debt-trap
diplomacy" [to foster a more mutually beneficial model of Arctic
economic development]{.underline}, [positioning Beijing to more adeptly
[exploit]{.mark} any [shortfalls by Arctic states to]{.mark}
sufficiently [support]{.mark} and re-empower their own [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} who are intimately aware of any unevenness
in Arctic social, cultural and economic development; a shift whose
beginnings are evident in [[China's 2018 Arctic white
paper]{.underline}]{.mark} where it, matching Japan, its principal
regional rival, [makes [reference]{.mark} to [Indigenous issues seven
times]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is especially noteworthy for a country
that does not even recognize its own domestic Indigenous peoples and
continues to impose its will on its many diverse minorities,
particularly those aspiring to greater autonomy. So, a triumph by the
democratic Arctic states is by no means guaranteed with regard to a
future battle for Indigenous hearts and minds, but the democratic Arctic
states still have many advantages over Russia and China that make it
unlikely either of these rivals could meaningfully undermine western
influence in the region, or dilute the undisputed sovereignty they have
over their respective Arctic territories.

[If there is to be a new Cold War in the Arctic region]{.underline} --
and many believe there already is one --[continued gains in native
development will be crucial to its successful outcome]{.underline}; and
it is here that [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its
[allies possess]{.mark} many [natural advantages]{.mark}, presenting an
opportunity to [consolidate victory and]{.mark} achieve an [unrivaled
regional supremacy through]{.mark}]{.underline} more inclusive and
effective governance -- in [[partnership with]{.mark} the [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} of the Arctic]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--Military\-\--Domain Awareness\-\--2NC 

#### Consultation with indigenous groups is uniquely key to establish and increase deployment of domain awareness. 

**Martin et al 22**
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/3171599/the-unconventional-approach-to-arctic-security-increasing-domain-awareness-thro/

[[Over]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[past]{.mark} few
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [Department of Defense
([DOD]{.mark}]{.underline}) has [[recognized]{.mark} the [threat]{.mark}
posed [by US]{.mark} strategic [competitors]{.mark} in]{.underline} this
[region [and crafted]{.mark} Arctic [strategies to address]{.mark} US
current [shortfalls]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 Yet, [in]{.underline} an [era
defined by increased]{.underline} fiscal constraints and potentially
emerging crises with Russia and China, the [question for US
leaders]{.underline} has [become: What level of investment]{.underline}
is [necessary to]{.underline} effectively [compete in]{.underline} the
[Arctic? Further]{.underline}, what are the [specific requirements of
each]{.underline} of the [services]{.underline} in what [is
primarily]{.underline} a [maritime domain, characterized by]{.underline}
remote [communities and]{.underline} scant [infrastructure]{.underline}?
The services' published strategies are not widely inclusive of special
operations forces (SOF) despite the challenges of the Arctic being ripe
for SOF's unique traits and increased return on investment in austere
environments.5 The [Army SOF ([ARSOF]{.mark}) enterprise
[provides]{.mark} unique [capabilities]{.mark} to]{.underline} the
[joint force to buy down risk [by]{.mark} leveraging [Indigenous
populations to provide domain awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}, strengthen
relationships, and build logistical networks. This [value]{.underline}
proposition is [especially relevant in]{.underline} a [theater of
operations that]{.underline} will [always be peripheral to US
strategy]{.underline}, strains logistical systems, [and has]{.underline}
a [high barrier to entry]{.underline} in terms of specialized supplies,
equipment, and training.

Vignette

The [year is 2025]{.underline}, and the [Arctic remains]{.underline} an
[arena of increasing]{.underline} strategic [competition over economic
and territorial gains. Along]{.underline} the [western slope of
Alaska]{.underline}, a [small Indigenous tribe]{.underline} is l[ocated
in]{.underline} the remote [village of Teller]{.underline}, which is
less than 50 miles from the Russian coastline and is home to
approximately 250 residents. Not far from Teller, a Chinese-funded
drilling company has agreed to help develop Alaska's liquefied natural
gas sector through a private deal with an Alaskan Native
corporation.6 [Over the years]{.underline}, the [village
infrastructure]{.underline} has [slowly deteriorated due to global
warming and the lack of government funding]{.underline} to correct the
many problems [caused by thawing permafrost and soil
erosion]{.underline}.7 The attitude of the population toward the US
government is neutral due to their limited engagement with state and
federal entities over the past few years and their increasing feeling of
isolation. The [continued effects of climate change]{.underline} in
[degrading]{.underline} their [already inadequate
infrastructure]{.underline} have [exacerbated]{.underline} such
[ambivalence]{.underline}.

Last week, the Chinese drilling company sent a small delegation to the
village to build a relationship and ensure the company's work would not
negatively affect the village. During the meeting with the village
elders, an agreement was made to allow some Chinese employees to live
among the population of Teller. In return, the company would provide
funding to upgrade the village infrastructure. The deal is a 10-year
contract that will allow the Chinese-backed company to maintain and
expand Chinese influence throughout the region. While it may seem
benign, this [[relationship]{.mark} could be the [beginning of]{.mark} a
malign actor presence that will fester throughout Alaska and further
isolate the many Indigenous villages in the region from the US
government if left unchecked]{.underline}.

Although this story is fictional, it could become a reality if the DOD
does not start engaging more effectively with the many vulnerable
Indigenous populations throughout the Alaskan coastline before our
adversaries do. [Countering malign influence]{.underline} would [benefit
from reexamining]{.underline} and leveraging a [crucial piece of
American history]{.underline}---the [DOD's use and [reliance
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Indigenous approach]{.underline}]{.mark}.
In the Arctic, this was done with the Alaskan Scouts during the World
War II. The Alaskan Scouts were a volunteer military organization that
employed more than 6,000 Native Alaskans to conduct
surveillance-and-support activities along the remote coastlines. There
are a [multitude of [opportunities]{.mark} in Alaska [that]{.mark} would
[not only increase]{.mark} US [national securit]{.mark}y
posture]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} also [allow ARSOF]{.mark} soldiers
[to refine]{.mark} their [Arctic]{.mark} tactics, [techniques]{.mark},
and procedures (TTP).]{.underline} These [refined skills]{.underline}
would also [help build ARSOF credibility and capability for combat
operations in Europe]{.underline} while training and exercising in the
High N

#### Cooperation with indigenous groups in the arctic effectively uses traditional knowledge to enable increased domain awareness and navigation tech.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the [vast expanse of]{.underline} the
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [U.S. [Coast Guard
confronts]{.mark}]{.underline} an [urgent [challenge: how to]{.mark}
check and [manage]{.mark} the rapidly [changing maritime domain
while]{.mark}]{.underline} [[respecting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [rights
and [knowledge of]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[indigenous
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 There is [[potential to integrate
indigenous knowledge]{.mark} into Coast Guard operations, [using]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [and collab]{.mark}oration]{.underline} to [[achieve
more]{.mark} comprehensive maritime [domain awareness while
safeguarding]{.mark}]{.underline} the [Arctic's ecosystems]{.underline}
and cultures.

Untapped Wisdom

[Indigenous communities]{.underline}, having [thrived in]{.underline}
the [[Arctic]{.mark} for generations]{.underline}, have a [[deep
understanding of]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}'s ecological
nuanc]{.underline}es. Indigenous ecological knowledge is a repository of
lived experience, a living document passed down through the oral
tradition and daily interactions with the land and sea. It encompasses
ice conditions, animal behavior, weather patterns, and a host of factors
critical to maritime operations. Consider, for example, indigenous
hunters' ability to read subtle signs in the ice to predict its
stability. This skill, honed over centuries, is invaluable in guiding
safe navigation through treacherous ice drifts.

By recognizing and incorporating indigenous knowledge, the Coast Guard
could not only enhance its operational effectiveness, but also honor the
custodians of this knowledge. It would be a step toward a more inclusive
approach to maritime operations that acknowledges the importance of
traditional wisdom as well as modern expertise.

Tradition + Innovation 

While [indigenous [ecological knowledge]{.mark} is a treasure [trove
of]{.mark} regional [insight]{.mark}, it [could be]{.mark} even
[more]{.mark} valuable coupled [with modern tech]{.mark}nology.
[Satellite]{.mark} imagery]{.underline}, for example, [[offers]{.mark} a
[bird's]{.mark}-eye [view of ice]{.mark} formations [and]{.mark}
wildlife [patterns that]{.mark} can [corroborate indigenous
observations]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would extend the reach of
observation beyond what is visible from the ground.

[Data [analytics]{.mark} can [distill vast]{.mark} amounts of
[info]{.mark}rmation [into]{.mark} actionable
[insights]{.mark}]{.underline}. Imagine a team that could analyze
indigenous hunters' reports on animal migration patterns alongside
satellite imagery to predict potential areas of human-animal
interaction. This [would [enhance safety for]{.mark} both indigenous
[communities and]{.mark} Coast Guard [personnel]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Predicting ice]{.mark} movements, [identifying]{.mark} hazardous
[conditions, and]{.mark} refining [weather]{.mark} forecasts are
[essential]{.mark} [components of]{.mark} maritime [safety]{.mark} and
operational success]{.underline} in the region[. A [system]{.mark} that
[combined indigenous]{.mark} [knowledge]{.mark} of the
[thickness]{.mark} and stability of sea ice [with]{.mark} satellite
[data on]{.mark} its [movements]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark} [early
warnings]{.mark} on areas prone to rapid ice shifts, [enabling safer
navigation]{.mark}]{.underline} and more effective planning for Coast
Guard operations.

In the context of search-and-rescue missions, indigenous knowledge of
the area and environmental conditions could improve response times and
success rates

[Lackenbauer and Kikkert]{.underline} (2020) [proposed detailed metrics
to]{.underline} more [rigorously measure the effectiveness of the
Canadian Rangers]{.underline}. Yet [academic [research and]{.mark}
anecdotal [evidence demonstrate]{.mark} that]{.underline} the [Canadian
[Rangers]{.mark} have [contributed in]{.mark} very [practical ways
to]{.mark} Arctic [MDA]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arctic [exercises have
[demonstrated]{.mark} the [value of]{.mark} having [access to Indigenous
peoples with]{.mark} extensive [experience]{.mark} operating [in harsh
conditions and]{.mark} who are willing to [share]{.mark} their
[local]{.mark} and traditional [knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Lackenbauer & Kikkert, 2020, xii). [Lessons learned or]{.underline}
post-[exercise [reports from CAF]{.mark} Arctic activities regularly
[highlight]{.mark} the [benefits of]{.mark} the [partnership]{.mark}
between Canadian Rangers and the CAF]{.underline} (Lackenbauer &
Kikkert, 2020, xii). [Some]{.underline} have [suggested that, given
their importance to domain awareness generally]{.underline} and MDA
specifically, [more should be done to ensure]{.underline} that [Canadian
Rangers receive the same level of support as other areas of]{.underline}
the [CAF]{.underline} (Stevens, 2021). This [aligns with
broader]{.underline} [discussions on reconciliation and]{.underline}
creating [better opportunities for Indigenous peoples in]{.underline}
the [Arctic]{.underline} (Stevens, 2021; Vullierme, 2021).

[[Satellites]{.mark}, AI, [and other tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}
are [[important to MDA]{.mark}. Receiving information "at]{.underline}
the [speed of relevancy" is imperative in many situations to make better
decisions]{.underline} (Charron, 2020, 4). [[Yet, we should be realistic
about]{.underline}]{.mark} the [l[imits of tech]{.mark}nology,
particularly in a region like the Arctic]{.underline} (Johnson, 2021).
As Charron (2020) points out, [disasters have been obverted on occasion
because a soldier or analyst doubted what a computer screen
suggested]{.underline} (Charron, 2020, 4). [[Decision makers]{.mark},
therefore, may [want to consider]{.mark} local and [traditional
knowledge as]{.mark} an integrative [tool to round out MDA]{.mark} in
appropriate circumstances]{.underline}. The Canadian [[Rangers]{.mark}
could [serve as]{.mark} a [model for]{.mark} this [proposition]{.mark}
in both Greenland and Alaska]{.underline} (Kikkert & Lackenbauer, 2021).
In the right [circumstances, local [and]{.mark} traditional knowledge
can [complement]{.mark} more [advanced tools to]{.mark} achieve
[more]{.mark} effective domain [awareness]{.mark} and hence more
informed decision making.]{.underline}

3. Context: Energy transitions in the circumpolar north

[In recent years, the [Arctic]{.mark} and sub-Arctic [regions
have]{.mark} seen an [increased]{.mark} interest in investment [in
mining]{.mark}]{.underline} and low-carbon energy infrastructure
\[[62]{.underline},[63]{.underline}\]. As [Fig. 2]{.underline} shows, at
least 80 % of low-carbon energy (all stages from planning to operating)
and mineral (including exploration, construction, operating, closure,
and abandonment) [projects are [intersected]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
territories where diverse circumpolar [Indigenous people]{.mark}\'s'
languages are spoken and Indigenous peoples hold land-based rights,
interests, and knowledges]{.underline}. This number could be even
higher, as the absence of Indigenous languages on the map does not
necessary mean there are no Indigenous peoples or land rights. And it is
likely that [[extractive]{.mark} and energy [industries will expand, be
it]{.mark} deep [seabed mineral exploration, rare earths mining]{.mark},
wind [energy generation,]{.mark} storage, and transmission and
transportation infrastructure]{.underline}. Among multiple drivers
behind this increase are energy security concerns, global geopolitical
re-alignments \[[64]{.underline}\], and numerous policies and strategic
documents, including the European Green Deal (2020), the European
Critical Raw Materials Act (2023), the US\'s Inflation Reduction Act
(2022), and Canada\'s Critical Minerals Strategy (2023), among others.
While these documents underscore the importance of balancing economic
development with social and environmental goals, [[there is a need to
bring light to]{.mark} the distribution of burdens and opportunities of
energy transition in the circumpolar north]{.underline}
\[[65]{.underline}\].

\[figure omitted\]

Central to this understanding is that [[energy transitions in
the]{.mark} circumpolar [north are]{.mark} deeply [intertwined
with]{.mark} the history of [colonialism]{.mark},]{.underline} as it
continues to shape the region\'s environmental and socio-political
landscape \[[33]{.underline},[66]{.underline}\]. [Colonial policies have
been [prioritizing extractive industries]{.mark} (such as fur trading,
[mining,]{.mark} forestry, hydropower [and oil]{.mark} extraction)
[in]{.mark} the [region perceived as the "terra nullius]{.mark}",
expropriating lands, and [marginalising Indigenous
communities]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[67]{.underline}\]. Ongoing energy
transitions are [intensifying resource extraction]{.underline} against
the legacy of historical and [[existing extractive industries]{.mark}
and [reproducing colonial attitudes as decision-making]{.mark} continues
to [exclude Indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[22]{.underline},[33]{.underline}\]. These dynamics have [led to the
framing of [the region]{.mark} as [a "green sacrifice
zone]{.mark}"]{.underline}
\[[35]{.underline},[36]{.underline},[68]{.underline}\], providing a deep
interrogation of neocolonial, racial, cultural, and environmental
underpinnings of making "green" industrial economies. [The concept of
"sacrifice zones" has gained popularity in the US]{.underline} regarding
nuclear testing locations, waste sites and [extractive regions, which
are "[sacrificed" for a higher purpose in the name of profit and
progress,]{.mark}]{.underline} highlighting environments and
[populations that are marginalised]{.underline}
\[[68]{.underline},[69]{.underline}\]. The value of its application [in
the Arctic context is]{.underline} that it "helps to see how the
participation and distribution of burdens and benefits are understood
and considered" given the [[impacts]{.mark} of industrial projects on
communities [driven by top-down policies]{.mark} and the global demand
for resources]{.underline} and low-carbon energy \[[69]{.underline}\]
(p. 106).

Issues of a just energy transition in the Arctic have received
increasing attention, with the calls for evaluation of existing
projects, legal instruments and policy frameworks, as well as
identification of gaps and areas for improvement \[[65]{.underline}\].
This review addresses these needs.

3.2 Key arenas for utilization of indigenous knowledge

When looking at the typical phases of EIA and SIA processes in Greenland
and the arenas where stakeholder involvement takes place, it becomes
apparent that [[there are several entry points]{.mark} where [indigenous
knowledge can be utilized]{.mark}]{.underline} (fig. 1). A closer
description of the different phases and why they constitute potential
arenas for the utilization of indigenous knowledge follows below.

[Scoping phase: [Public pre-consultation]{.mark}]{.underline} (draft
ToR)

Since 2012, a public pre-consultation has been required during the
scoping phase of a project [to [ensure early involvement of
stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline} in Greenland. Applicants have to
[[prepare a draft]{.mark} Terms of Reference]{.underline} (draft ToR)
based on initial scoping, [[setting out a]{.mark} preliminary [table of
contents]{.mark}]{.underline} for the EIA and SIA reports. The draft ToR
is [submitted to the authorities [and published]{.mark} on the
government]{.underline} of Greenland website [[for a]{.mark} 35 day
[public pre-consultation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The public
pre-consultation [provides the first entry point where indigenous
knowledge can be utilized.]{.underline} Based on submitted comments from
stakeholders, the [[applicant will revise the draft]{.mark} ToR for
final approval by the government]{.underline} of Greenland. [A white
paper]{.underline} for the ToR containing the received comments and the
responses from the applicant and authorities [will be made publicly
available.]{.underline}

\[diagram omitted\]

[[Impact assessment phase]{.underline}:]{.mark} Drafting the EIA and SIA
reports

Subsequent to the approval of the ToR by the authorities, [the applicant
can commence the process of drafting the EIA report and the SIA report.
This [includes a baseline study and data collection]{.mark} to make an
environmental and a social baseline respectively]{.underline}. These
baselines are [used as the foundation on which [predictions of the
impact]{.mark} from the planned mineral resource activities [are made,
the significance]{.mark} of a negative impact on the environment or
social conditions [is assessed, and mitigation]{.mark} measures are
[proposed]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the impact assessment phase[,
[consultants can draw upon]{.mark} knowledge from several sources. This
provides the second entry point for utilizing [indigenous
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. The draft EIA/SIA report is then
submitted to the government of Greenland for the next phase.

EIA/SIA report review phase: Public consultation

[When the draft EIA/SIA report fulfils the minimum requirements[, it is
submitted to the government]{.mark}]{.underline} of Greenland and
published on the government of Greenland website [[for]{.mark} an eight
week [public consultation]{.mark}. During the eight weeks, public
consultation meetings [must be held in towns and settlements
significantly affected]{.mark}, whether directly or indirectly, by the
mineral resource activities.]{.underline} The public consultation period
[[allows the public to submit]{.mark} their [comments]{.mark} in oral
form,]{.underline} e.g. at the public meetings[, or in written
submissions. This provides the third entry point where indigenous
knowledge can be utilized.]{.underline}

When the public consultation period is over, [the [applicant will
revise]{.mark} the Draft EIA/SIA reports [based on the]{.mark} written
comments submitted during the public [consultation]{.mark} period, and
the oral comments raised at the public consultation
meetings.]{.underline} The revised EIA/SIA report is [submitted for
final approval by the government]{.underline} of Greenland. The final
EIA/SIA reports provide a basis for the decision-making process with all
information necessary to determine the conditions of permission and
approval of the proposed mineral resource activities. A white paper for
the EIA/SIA report containing the received written and oral comments,
and the responses from the applicant and authorities, will be made
publicly available.

Considering the stakeholder involvement that takes place during these
three phases, we have identified them as arenas for the utilization of
indigenous knowledge in EIA and SIA processes in relation to mineral
resource activities in Greenland (fig. 2). Besides the three arenas
mentioned in Figure 2, there is at least one other arena, which may be
considered relevant as an entry point for utilizing indigenous
knowledge. This is the monitoring phase after the approval of a mineral
resources activity as defined in the Environmental Management Plan,
which covers the monitoring of impacts during construction, operation,
closure and post-closure stages. The EIA guidelines state that:

\[diagram omitted\]

[The Environmental Management Plan shall include a comprehensive
plan/programme for control and ongoing monitoring of, for instance,
emissions, discharges, disturbance of and damage to
wildlife.]{.underline}

4. Discussion

[[Insufficient consideration]{.mark} of the [indigenous]{.mark}
peoples\' [interests during Arctic]{.mark} industrial
[development]{.mark} can [lead to conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
harmonize them with business a methodological toolkit is proposed. It
includes the development of a matrix for interests' coordination of the
target groups. The compensation projects can be defined as well.

[As a result of the [sociological surveys]{.mark} in the Anabar
district, the priority problems of the local communities have been
[identified.]{.mark}]{.underline} They could be [solved with mining
company support, e.g., [employment,]{.mark} transport and [social
infrastructure development,]{.mark} construction of a centralized [water
supply]{.mark} system, traditional crafts support, traditional [culture
preservation, etc.]{.mark}]{.underline} This approach makes it possible
to [[protect]{.mark} the interests of the [indigenous peoples]{.mark}
and their communities [during investment projects']{.mark} implementing
on exploration and extraction of minerals in the Arctic]{.underline}
([Sleptsov, 2021]{.underline}). [The [benefits for local government
are taxes,]{.mark} socio-economic [development,]{.mark} new
[jobs,]{.mark} social, environmental, transport
[infrastructure.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The models of interaction between business and indigenous peoples
implemented in Russia largely correspond to the basic approaches used in
other Arctic countries, for example, in Canada. This country has vast
experience in agreements concluded on compensation. There are various
forms of them. They are also called development agreements,
participation agreements, or socio-economic agreements. The peculiarity
of such agreements is that they are aimed at [[creating favorable
conditions for both]{.mark} indigenous peoples and
investors.]{.underline} Usually, such conditions are discussed during
the impact assessment. Canada has many years of experience in
negotiating such agreements. [[Mining has a great]{.mark} social and
cultural [impact]{.mark} on the local population. Such projects [provide
economic benefits]{.mark} in the form of employment, procurement
contracts, and [can lead to environmental
pollution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Impact and Benefit Agreements]{.mark} (IBAS) [are negotiated]{.mark}
between mining companies and indigenous communities. They [minimize the
negative impact]{.mark} of mining [on]{.mark} the environment and [the
local population]{.mark}, as well as [guarantee them benefits,]{.mark}
and also [avoid conflicts]{.mark} during the industrial development of
traditional lands.]{.underline}

Among certain difficulties and limitations in coordinating the interests
of mining corporations and indigenous peoples in the industrial
development of the Arctic, it is possible to include the complexity of
assessing and taking into account the impact of the separated effects
of [climate change]{.underline} in the development of mining projects[.
Also, taking into account the impact of compensation projects with the
financial support of mining companies on the quality of life of the
local population in a more distant perspective presents certain
problems]{.underline}. For these purposes, the procedure of ethnological
examination of projects and conducting sociological surveys of the
population after the completion of the project for the development of
the deposit can be proposed. [For problem-solving of interests
coordinating between mining companies and the indigenous peoples in the
Arctic industrial development, a [matrix of]{.mark} their [balance has
been]{.mark} developed and [tested]{.mark}. This balance matrix
[integrates positive and negative impact assessments]{.mark} as well as
conducts a [comprehensive analysis for compensation]{.mark} projects'
development.]{.underline} The balance matrix is informationally related
to the model of optimal choice of economic and compensation projects.
The model considers the impact of business projects on the environment
and the regional development. The balance matrix estimates the
sufficiency of selected projects using the model to achieve harmonious
relations between business and indigenous peoples.

The proposed methodological tools allow to solve the problem of
responsible and sustainable industrial development of the Arctic
regions. It can [be used to manage the risk of conflicts during
exploration and extraction of natural resources in the Arctic
countries.]{.underline}

[[Improve Transnational Connections for Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}

Some interviewees mentioned [that c[ommunication]{.mark} between
Indigenous peoples [is currently at risk]{.mark} and [communities are
increasingly siloed,]{.mark}]{.underline} partly due to the scarce
infrastructures (poor internet connectivity was often highlighted), but
also [[due to unnatural border]{.mark}s between communities
\[]{.underline}Interview 6, 8, 14\]. Such borders often cut across
Indigenous communities, such as the [[Inuits in]{.mark} Yukon ([Canada)
and Alaska]{.mark},]{.underline} and the [[Sámi across]{.mark} the
Scandinavian [Arctic and Russia]{.mark}, who 'sometimes might have more
connection with a group across the border]{.underline} than they would
have with other Sámi groups within the same countries', [because state
borders didn't exist centuries ago]{.underline} \[Interview 8\]. In some
areas of the circumpolar Arctic, such as Sweden, Norway, and Finland, it
is easier to cross borders whereas in others, such as [[between Canada
and the U.S, it i]{.mark}s more difficult]{.underline} \[Interview 6\].
[[Arctic states,]{.mark} especially the United States and Canada, [could
work together to increase mobility for Indigenous peoples]{.mark} across
state borders \[Interview 6\].]{.underline}61 On the one hand, this
could [[enhance human security]{.mark} for Indigenous peoples by
ensuring that their rights are respected.]{.underline} On the other
hand, governments are shielded against potential legal issues
\[Interview 6\]. For example, in 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada
granted to Richard Desautel, a U.S. citizen and member of the Lakes
tribe of the Colville Confederated Tribes who shot an elk in British
Columbia, the right to hunt on his ancestral Canadian lands after a very
long trial.62

[Communication between Indigenous peoples can also be improved [through
existing transboundary dialogues]{.mark} such as the Arctic Leaders'
Summit (ALS]{.underline}). The summit, set up by the six Permanent
Participants in 1991, creates unique opportunities for transnational
collaboration. As stated in the latest ALS summary declaration:

'There are many similarities in the visions of the six PP organizations,
but paths may vary on how they see their visions implemented. They are
[[united by]{.mark} the declarations, [passion]{.mark} for youth
involvement, [and desire to protect]{.mark} their peoples, wildlife,
lands, and waters]{.underline}. There are few Indigenous peoples in the
circumpolar north, and as a result, they need those who believe in
this vision to be supportive and invest in their vision.'

Such a view is shared by the Arctic Indigenous Youth Leaders Summit,
where Indigenous Youth Leaders recognise that '[[though]{.mark} we are
[separated by]{.mark} language, cultures, and by [borders, we are all
facing the same issues.'63]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--U.S./Russia Cooperation/Science Diplomacy\-\--2NC

#### Utilization of indigenous knowledge helps international diplomatic processes

When it comes to the proportion of a specific type of SD, [the most
frequently used is diplomacy for science, which is observed in all
Arctic states' strategic documents]{.underline}. Science in diplomacy is
the second most identified type of SD and it is mostly used by Denmark
but also by Norway, Sweden and Canada. It [is also briefly applied by
the USA, Iceland and Russia.]{.underline} Only Finland did not apply it
at all. Interestingly, science in diplomacy is often connected to
specific areas of cooperation. In particular, SD is used to inform
decision making, for example in connection to delimitation of the
continental shelf, management of the environment, and innovation and
development based on scientific knowledge. Moreover, the strategies
refer to the relevance of science agreements developed under the
auspices of the AC. [[Indigenous Peoples and]{.mark} Indigenous
[Knowledge]{.mark} also [play a role in important]{.mark} international
[processes]{.mark}, hence [contributing to international policy
development]{.mark}.]{.underline} The least applied type of SD is
[[science for diplomacy,]{.mark} which could be [considered]{.mark} as
[an ideal tool to improve relations between
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} This type was observed a few times in
all strategies, with the exception of the USA.

#### Russia and the U.S. want to increase scientific diplomacy -- but indigenous collaboration is key

**Everett & Halašková 21** \[Karen Everett is the Canada Research Chair
on Comparative Aboriginal Condition, Barbora Halašková; Department of
International Relations and European Studies, "Is it real? Science

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362734584_Is_it_real_Science_diplomacy_in_the_Arctic_states\'\_strategies\]

[The AC is also highlighted in [Russia's newest Arctic strategy]{.mark}
as part of [their international cooperation goals]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Putin, 2020). This goes hand in hand with Russia's Chairmanship that
i[ncludes international [collaboration on sustainable development and
Indigenous cultural projects]{.mark} (Putin, 2020). This could [refer to
diplomacy for science]{.mark} as it will require international
cooperation.]{.underline} Finally, in the case of the [[US]{.mark}A,
their strategy [promotes international cooperation via
"]{.mark}bilateral relationships]{.underline} and multilateral bodies,
including the Arctic Council"(The Whites House, 2013, p. 2). The
[reference to [diplomacy for science]{.mark} could]{.underline}
indirectly be seen in the effort of "the United States \[to\] continue
to emphasize the Arctic Council as a forum for [facilitating Arctic
states' cooperation on myriad issues]{.underline} of mutual interest
within its current mandate" (The White House, 2013, p. 9). Research
could surely be one of the areas from the range of issues the AC
supports, as it is also highlighted by the USA.

#### Indigenous political agency contributes to broader climate research and arctic governance \-\-- independently solves advantage 2 better 

**Gricius 23** \[Gabrielle Gricus is a graduate Research Fellow (North
American and Arctic Defence and Security Network), "Scoping Arctic
expertise: The mismatch between traditional theories of expertise and
Indigenous expertise," 10/26/2023,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380204729_Scoping_Arctic_expertise_The_mismatch_between_traditional_theories_of_expertise_and_Indigenous_expertise\]

Perhaps one of the most interesting phenomena found during the
literature review was the difficulty in finding sources that identified
Indigenous knowledge as expertise. It became clear during an early
analysis that merely looking for literature based on keywords that
relied upon Western concepts of expertise and knowledge was leaving out
key actors in the Arctic -- namely, Indigenous Peoples. As one example,
Inkeri Koskinen (2016) argued that epistemic communities may be
difficult to conceptualise when taking Indigenous knowledge into
consideration as they do not fit into a limited objective view of
science and academia.

This dearth of scholarship conceptualising Indigenous knowledges as
expertise was interesting given that there is a vast amount of
scholarship that explores the centrality of Indigenous knowledge to the
Arctic. [There is a significant number of pieces that, for example,
illustrated how [scientists can learn from]{.mark} local [Indigenous
knowledge to advance knowledge on climate change]{.mark} (Krupnik, 2009)
[and]{.mark} broader studies on [how traditional ecological
knowledge]{.mark} ([TEK]{.mark}) [was incorporated into climate change
policy on a national,]{.mark} regional, and local [level]{.mark}
(Vinyeta & Lynn, 2013).]{.underline} As another example, Henry
Huntington (2000) has specifically unpacked how [[TEK can be
incorporated]{.mark} into science [via specific methodologies.]{.mark}
Andres L´opez Rivera (2021) similarly wrote about [the broader field of
climate]{.mark} change [governance diversified ways of knowing
regarding]{.mark} the climate crisis,]{.underline} what he names
"epistemic diversity." He specifically used the Swedish side of Sápmi to
illustrate how Indigenous Peoples have self-mobilised to mitigate
climate change on a community level. Further, another scholar Daria
Burnasheva (2020) explored how climate change is understood from an
Indigenous paradigm, reflecting on how Indigenous communities in Sakha
are shaped by the ice. Nicolien van Luijk et al. (2021) presented the
findings from their interviews with Inuit communities across Canada for
how Inuit understand Canadian Arctic sovereignty and security -- namely
how these communities are concerned about increased shipping and
interest in the Canadian Arctic.

A separate group of scholars have written about the political role of
Indigenous People in the Arctic. While there are many that have explored
this topic, particularly notable is Timo Koivurova & Heinämäki (2006),
who wrote about how [[Indigenous People are particularly well suited to
take advantage of soft law in the Arctic,]{.mark} particularly in the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. Similarly, Monica Tennberg (2010) has built
upon the idea of Indigenous People as political actors in the Arctic,
arguing that Indigenous political agency is built upon multiple forms of
power -- particularly acting, this power may enable and constrain
Indigenous political agency and there are multiple sites for this
interaction. Similarly, Michaela Louise Coote (2016) explored the role
of Indigenous People in the Arctic Council, finding that they are often
successful in manoeuvring on questions of environmental governance in
the Arctic although they are constrained often due to a lack of
capacity. Greenland was also a common theme across pieces from the
Arctic Yearbook, with many pieces across its history covering identity
narration in foreign policy (Jacobsen, 2015), natural resource
extraction politics (Dingman, 2014), and indigeneity (Sowa, 2013). The
Arctic Yearbook also has had several full sections on Indigenous
perspectives such as its section on "Indigenous, Northern and Gender
Creativities and Perspectives" in its 2020 edition, "Art and Culture in
Identity" in its 2021 edition,"People, Art, and Culture"in its 2022
edition, and most recently a whole yearbook with the theme "Arctic
Indigenous Peoples: Climate, Science, Knowledge, and Governance." In
this edition, Yang Jian (2023) wrote about how [[expert communities have
sources of power]{.mark} in the Arctic, how th[ey mobilise knowledge,
and how they contribute to Arctic governance]{.mark}. Again, across
these works, [Indigenous People are described]{.mark} [in terms
of]{.mark} their [political agency]{.mark} and their role as rights
holders and even as knowledge brokers but are not described through the
framework of epistemic communities.]{.underline}

#### Science diplomacy and arctic governance only succeeds when utilizing indigenous knowledge contributions

University, "Science Diplomacy Challenges at the Poles," 10/17/2024,

Agents of Science Diplomacy

Diplomacy is conventionally understood to concern interstate relations
conducted by national governmental representatives. [Conceptions of
science diplomacy extend this logic to respective nations' research
communities, though still largely focusing on interactions at the
international level and in the domain of the state.]{.underline}
However, we suggest that the central actor or indicator is missing in
the conceptualization and practices of science diplomacy.

By examining science diplomacy practices in the polar context, we can
observe a multi-level model of engagement at work, involving
governmental and non-governmental organizations and actors. This can
include sub-national actors influencing political discourse and policy
through the dissemination of science-based publications. Here, we draw
attention to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) influencing Arctic policy
debates by their publication of a factsheet on Arctic oil and gas.2
Other examples include non-governmental organizations leading
initiatives to change policy, blurring the boundaries between science
diplomacy, policy, advocacy, and communication.3

Knowledges for Science Diplomacy

We argue that the label "science diplomacy" limits the kinds of
knowledge systems that are included in its scope. [[In]{.mark} the
reality of [science diplomacy]{.mark} in the Arctic, [a host of other
knowledges]{.mark} and research practices [are at work]{.mark}, from
Indigenous or Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)]{.underline} to
local knowledge and citizen science. While there is growing
collaboration in research between science and TEK in funded research
projects, and even some major international agreements (such as the
Paris Agreement) that make space for Indigenous knowledge, [[there is
insufficient recognition and inclusion]{.mark} of recommendations in
agreements that emerge from science diplomacy efforts.]{.underline}

[Not only does [the exclusion of other forms of knowledge]{.mark} beyond
traditional forms of science [limit the effectiveness of science
diplomacy outcomes]{.mark}, but it also raises questions of structural
injustice4 and challenges for the exercise of Indigenous
sovereignty.]{.underline} Excluding Indigenous knowledge holders from
'science' diplomacy through labelling conventions or from the
co-creation of policy outcomes through systemic marginalization
inherently undermines Indigenous rights and self-determination.5

[Within the current framework, [TEK contributions are not considered
alongside STEM or SSH6]{.mark} research as the primary knowledge basis
that science diplomacy is informed by and facilitates, [limiting TEK's
recognition]{.mark} and influence. [Yet, the value of TEK has been
proven many times over]{.mark}, evident in contributions of Indigenous
knowledge in the Arctic context. For instance, in [the Gwich'in
Council]{.mark} International's [work on wildfires]{.mark} via the
Arctic Circle Working Groups on the Conservation of Arctic Flora and
Fauna ([CAFF]{.mark}) and Emergency Prevention, Preparedness,
[and]{.mark} Response ([EPPR]{.mark}).7 We argue that [the framework of
science diplomacy should include other forms of knowledge and
agency.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Science Diplomacy is Not Just for the Good Guys

Discussions of science diplomacy in politics, the media, and academic
literature often frame science diplomacy as premised on good intentions.
In this approach, collaboration is understood as the development of
mutual understanding between nations and science-informed strategic
thinking, especially in building solutions for global challenges. But,
like all frameworks or tools intended for finding common interest in
political relationships, science diplomacy can also be used to amplify
business or state interests, advancing geopolitical interests divorced
from the common good. We see this as malignant science diplomacy, with
varying significance in the Arctic with its permanent populations and
sovereign governance versus the Antarctic and its suspended claims to
sovereignty and management through the multi-lateral Antarctic Treaty
System.

Turning to the Antarctic, the example of emperor penguin protection
highlights how geopolitical interests can block science-informed policy.
Proposals to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) to better safeguard
the penguins from the effects of the climate crisis, pollution, and
tourism have enjoyed widespread support from nations active in Antarctic
governance. However, Russian and Chinese governments have repeatedly
opposed them using what experts are calling "'spurious science' and
other bad-faith arguments."8 The Chinese government, in particular, has
been criticized for citing the work of a divisive researcher who
questions the impacts of climate change on polar species.9 Other nations
have announced plans to implement the MPA proposal "on a national basis"
despite China and Russia's objections.10 While this push to implement
MPAs neatly fits the conventional understanding of science diplomacy,
its premise on positive intent (e.g., pro-conservation science
diplomacy) poses challenges to the analysis and interpretation of Russia
and China's opposition.

Similarly, elsewhere in the Arctic, economic interests are driving the
development and exploitation of culturally and environmentally sensitive
landscapes, as seen in renewable energy development and
geoengineering.11 These examples illustrate the vulnerability of
conventional understandings of science diplomacy, which build on
inherently optimistic interpretations of the framework.12

Outlook

With geopolitical tensions in the polar regions again rising, many see
science diplomacy as pointing to potential avenues for peaceful
cooperation. [However, [the reality of science diplomacy]{.mark} in the
polar regions [challenges existing conventions]{.mark} regarding what
science diplomacy is and whom it involves]{.underline}. In light of
this, [we call for [an evolution of]{.mark} the [science
diplomacy]{.mark} concept [that]{.mark} sets out distinctly defined
practices and pivotal actors, [considers different systems of
knowledge]{.mark} beyond conventional scientific research, [involves
Indigenous knowledge holders in decision-making
processes]{.mark},]{.underline} and does not shy away from discussing
the causes and consequences of malignant science diplomacy on
cooperation in the key focus of polar governance: environmental
protection. We propose that [bringing [these dimensions]{.mark} into the
framework for science diplomacy [will strengthen its use as a tool of
cooperation]{.mark} both [among states]{.mark} [and]{.mark} across
[multiple levels of governance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The plan only works in tandem with integration of indigenous cultural knowledge to address common concerns

**Berkman et Al 17** \[Paul Arthur Berkman, Lars Kullerud, Allen Pope,
Alexander N. Vylegzhanin, Oran R. Young; International Science Council,
"The Arctic Science Agreement propels science diplomacy," 11/03/2017,
https://www.changingtheconversation.ca/sites/all/images/Biodiversity%20Library/Articles/BD_Pubs/Berkmanetall_ArcticScienceAgreemtn.pdf\]

Negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council through a process
co-led by Russia and the United States, the agreement recognizes first
"the importance of maintaining peace, stability, and constructive
cooperation in the Arctic." [[This]{.mark} legally binding [agreement
aims to enhance scientific cooperation by]{.mark} "[removing
obstacles]{.mark}" (4) and by providing a basic road map and commitment
to facilitate consistent access for marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric
research on a pan-Arctic scale.]{.underline}

The agreement aims to improve use of existing infrastructures that were
previously unavailable; enable new movement of researchers, students,
equipment, and materials; promote sharing of data and metadata in ways
that were not previously possible; and encourage holders of traditional
and local knowledge to participate in scientific activities across
territories (see the map). The science community, working through the
organizations representing it in the Arctic Council, including IASC, the
University of the Arctic (UArctic), and the International Arctic Social
Sciences Association (IASSA), as well as through separate meetings of
science ministers, already has identified substantive priorities for the
next phase of Arctic research (5).

[[Concrete examples of improvements needed to achieve success with the
agreement would be to]{.underline}]{.mark} (i) establish procedures to
expedite the granting of visas and permits for accessing field sites;
(ii) digitize historic and other data from hard-copy formats and create
shared platforms for searching data located in a variety of
repositories, including coordination with the Arctic Data Committee and
Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks; (iii) use organizations mentioned
in the agreement to set up and monitor research partnerships across
borders; (iv) increase support for field and summer schools and related
means for training the next generation of Arctic scientists; (v)
[promote well-formulated comparative studies designed to examine common
issues at multiple locations across the Arctic; (vi) maximize the use of
icebreakers and other forms of infrastructure for scientific purposes;
and (vii) [create innovative venues that integrate natural and social
sciences along with indigenous knowledge to address common
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}

Recognizing the value of Antarctic Treaty linkages with the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research, national academies of science moved
quickly to establish IASC in 1990. Science-based public agencies took
the lead in the 1991 formation of the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy, which then became the first signed record of international
governance among the eight Arctic States (see SM). [This catalyzed
[the]{.mark} 1996 [establishment of the Arctic Council]{.mark} (10) as a
"high level forum" of the eight Arctic States [and six indigenous
peoples organizations]{.mark} with observers and six technical and
science-based working groups, involving key Arctic stakeholders (see the
map and SM).]{.underline} In parallel, the education community created
the Circumpolar Universities Association in 1989. With the endorsement
of the Arctic Council, the UArctic was born in 1998 (see the map).

**Saami Council 25** \[The Saami Council is a voluntary Saami
organization (a non--governmental organization), with Saami member
organizations in Finland, Russia, Norway and Sweden, "The Important Role
of Indigenous Knowledge in Global Climate Governance," 05/12/2025,
https://arctic-council.org/ru/news/the-important-role-of-indigenous-knowledge-in-global-climate-governance/\]

Indigenous Peoples are the eyes and ears of a changing Arctic. Having
survived and thrived in the circumpolar region for millennia, they
possess essential knowledge for mitigation and adaptation efforts. As
highlighted during the Arctic Regional Gathering in Girkonjárga
(Kirkenes), Norway, in October 2024, Indigenous Knowledge Holders from
across the Arctic called for their voices and knowledge to be integrated
into global climate governance. In this article, the gathering's host,
the Saami Council, shares key insights from the discussions.

The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate -- three times faster than the
global average. For the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic, this change is
not an abstract scientific statistic; it's a lived reality, deeply
affecting their lands, livelihoods and ways of life. In response to
these challenges, an Arctic Regional Gathering was convened as part of
the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform (LCIPP) in
collaboration with the Norwegian Chairship. This gathering, held in
Girkonjárga (Kirkenes), Norway, in October 2024, brought together
Indigenous Knowledge Holders from across the Arctic to share
experiences, discuss climate solutions and advocate for policy actions
that respect and make use of Indigenous Knowledge.

Participants included representatives from the Aleut, Athabascan,
Gwich'in, Inuit, Sámi, Masni and Telengit. [The Knowledge Holders
emphasized that [Arctic Indigenous Peoples have survive]{.mark}d and
thrived [for millennia through deep]{.mark} ecological [knowledge and
sustainable]{.mark} land stewardship [practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Elin Magga, a Sámi reindeer herder and the deputy chair of the local
reindeer herder entity, opened the gathering by describing how climate
change is already disrupting traditional Sámi ways of life. She
highlighted how unpredictable winter rain creates ice layers in the
snow, making grazing difficult or even impossible for reindeer. Unsafe
ice conditions and shifting migration patterns also adds to factors
making herding increasingly challenging. In response, herders are forced
to buy expensive supplementary feed, adding financial strain to already
vulnerable communities. Other Sámi reindeer herders shared similar
concerns.

For Inuit communities, shifts in sea ice conditions are affecting
hunting traditions. Hunters now travel at greater risk to find
traditional foods. "The melting permafrost is also causing our homes to
sink," noted an Inuk youth participant, underscoring the urgent need for
climate adaptation strategies tailored to Indigenous realities.

Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic rely on reindeer herding, fishing,
hunting and gathering practices that are becoming increasingly
challenging due to climate change.

[[The Arctic plays a crucial role in global climate stability.]{.mark}
Its ice and permafrost store massive amounts of carbon, and its ocean
currents regulate global weather patterns. [The melting of Arctic
ice]{.mark} contributes to rising sea levels and altered ocean
circulation, [impact]{.mark}ing [ecosystems and communities
worldwide]{.mark}.]{.underline} Participants stressed that protecting
the Arctic is not just about safeguarding Indigenous Peoples\'
cultures---it is essential for global climate stability.

[Indigenous [Knowledge Holders provid]{.mark}ed [firsthand]{.mark}
[testimonies of climate impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} One Inuit
participant shared that traditional weather forecasting, vital for
hunting and navigation, is now unreliable due to rapid environmental
changes. "My father's knowledge of predicting weather no longer works,"
he explained. "The ice we depend on is disappearing, forcing polar bears
into our communities and making it dangerous for us to travel."

[Beyond climate change, Arctic Indigenous Peoples face additional
pressures from industrial development.]{.underline} Plans for wind power
industry, mining, and increased shipping threaten traditional land use
and disrupt sensitive ecosystems. [Participants at the gathering
emphasized that climate action cannot come at the expense of the rights
of Indigenous Peoples and cultural survival. "We cannot replace one
environmental crisis with another," one Sámi leader asserted. "A just
transition must respect Indigenous Peoples' land rights and
self-determination."]{.underline}

Utilizing Indigenous Knowledge into Climate Policies

[The gathering reaffirmed that [Indigenous Knowledge must be
recognized]{.mark} and utilized [as a vital tool for climate adaptation
and mitigation.]{.mark} Arctic [Indigenous Peoples have
developed]{.mark} [intricate knowledge systems based on generations of
close observation of environmental patterns.]{.mark} [These knowledge
systems offer solutions for]{.mark} ecosystem management, [sustainable
resource use and resilience-building]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Participants called for meaningful utilization of Indigenous Knowledge
in global climate governance. The LCIPP's engagement with the Warsaw
International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and the Katowice Committee
of Experts highlights ongoing efforts to integrate Indigenous Peoples\'
perspectives into climate policy frameworks. However, Indigenous Peoples
at the Arctic Regional Gathering stressed that participation must be
more than symbolic; it must translate into tangible policy changes and
direct funding for Indigenous-led climate solutions.

The Arctic Regional Gathering concluded with a strong foundation for
urgent climate action. [Participants emphasized the [need for
governments]{.mark} and international bodies [to recognize the Arctic as
a vulnerable ecosystem]{.mark} that's [critical to global]{.mark}
climate [stability]{.mark}. They stressed [the importance of]{.mark}
fully [utilizing]{.mark} [Indigenous Knowledge in climate
policies]{.mark} and decision-making processes to ensure that these
strategies reflect the lived experiences and expertise of Indigenous
Peoples.]{.underline}

[[Ensuring]{.mark} the [participation]{.mark} [of Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark} in climate governance at all levels [is vital
for]{.mark} equitable and [effective policymaking]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Participants also highlighted the disproportionate climate burdens faced
by Arctic Indigenous Peoples and called for immediate measures to
address these inequities. Direct, ongoing and accessible climate finance
is necessary to support adaptation and mitigation efforts led by
Indigenous Peoples, enabling communities to take proactive steps toward
climate resilience.

Arctic Indigenous Knowledge Holders made it clear: [the wellbeing of
their communities is intertwined with the health of the Arctic
environment. As climate change accelerates, the world must listen to
those who have stewarded these lands for millennia. The
[knowledge]{.mark}, perspectives and rights [of Indigenous Peoples must
be at the heart of climate solutions]{.mark}---not as an afterthought,
but [as a guiding principle for a sustainable
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A prominent solution [to maximise the benefits of]{.mark} using
[IK]{.mark} in building climate adaptation and resilience as outlined by
all the 71 papers [is the need for more research in IK]{.mark} and
practices with a focus on diverse community types impacted by climate
change]{.underline}. Indigenous people respond as a group and are very
effective as organised communities in responding to climate variables,
which research should focus on understanding that knowledge systems of
Indigenous people (Petzold et al. 2020; Shaffril et al. 2020; Inaotombi
and Mahanta 2018; Sakapaji 2021; Vargas 2019; Mensah et al. 2020) with a
multidisciplinary approach as IK is unique to every geographical
location (Kahlon and Singh 2021; Petzold et al. 2020; Shaffril et al.
2020).

In the past 30 years, extensive research has been done on IK but the
focus in relation to climate change and adaptive capacity building is a
recent phenomenon (Granderson 2017). In the past, science always took
priority over IK in research and development (Jiri et al. 2015).
[However, [the need]{.mark} for [bridging it with scientific knowledge
has become]{.mark} more [urgent]{.mark}]{.underline} because Indigenous
community can no longer rely solely on IK (Launio et al. 2020) or on
scientific knowledge (Filho et al. 2022) considering unpredictable
changes brought forth by climate change (Launio et al. 2020; Nunn et al.
2024). [Therefore, [bridging IK and scientific knowledge]{.mark} systems
[will complement each other]{.mark}]{.underline} (Legide et al. 2024;
Ingty 2017; Makondo and Thomas 2018). Although Indigenous people have
confidence in IK (Apraku et al. 2021; Mensah et al. 2020), overwhelming
focus on the technical aspects leads to a lack of research on climate
adaptation methods of Indigenous communities (Mangada, 2021; Sakapaji
2021; Vargas 2019; Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018). [More [research should
be conducted]{.mark} to [explore]{.mark} the ecological [values of
IK]{.mark} [and its role in climate change adaptation and
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mangada 2021; Sakapaji 2022; Sakapaji
2021; Tugjamba et al. 2021) in underresearched areas (Kupika et al.
2019), underrepresented regions (Petzold et al. 2020) like the
Asia-Pacific territories where 70% of the global Indigenous population
resides (Shaffril et al. 2020) and poor communities (Sakapaji 2021;
Siggia et al. 2016). A bridged knowledge system can be used to make
informed decisions to enhance agricultural food security (Kupika et al.
2019), informing policy on best practices to build adaptative capacity
(Kupika et al. 2019), to identify best management approaches (Li and Han
2022), verify models and climate scenarios (Mangada 2021), and it helps
in reducing losses due to climate events (Mangada, 2021). Bridging IK
and scientific knowledge becomes inevitable in agriculture for effective
adaptation, resilience building, and sustainability (Sakapaji 2022).

[Future [research should focus]{.mark} on exploring [how]{.mark}
Indigenous [communities can influence adaptation]{.mark} policy [to
provide a more comprehensive understanding]{.mark} of the existing
research landscape]{.underline} (Petzold et al. 2020). A bridged
knowledge system will provide diverse approaches to allow Indigenous
communities to select options that best align with their sociocultural,
political, and ecological contexts (Rarai et al. 2022; Tugjamba et al.
2021; Theodory 2021). For this bridging to be effective, it is necessary
to first determine the conditions under which the bridged knowledge
systems are mutually 1 While most of the 71 identified papers in this
study use the word 'integration' to describe the incorporation between
IK and scientific knowledge, this paper uses the term 'bridge' and its
derivatives based on extensive literature on 'Two-Eyed Seeing, Knowledge
Weaving/ Braiding, and Bridging Knowledge Systems'. As noted by Nadasdy
(1999, p. 15) "the project of knowledge-integration also takes for
granted existing power relations between Aboriginal people and the state
by assuming that traditional knowledge is simply a new form of "data" to
be incorporated into already existing management bureaucracies and acted
upon by scientists and resource managers". 1116 Environmental Management
(2024) 74:1101--1123 consistent and compatible (Sakapaji 2022; Legide et
al. 2024). It is also necessary to harmonise the top-down
standardisation approaches of governments to the bottom-up approaches of
Indigenous communities (Sakapaji 2022; Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018). It
has been suggested that [there seems to be too much focus on simply
documenting IK rather than incorporating it into policy (de Scally and
Doberstein 2022) and the bridging of IK and scientific knowledge is
still limited in the science-policy process]{.underline} (Filho et al.
2023). Scientific knowledge should accommodate IK in mainstreaming
climate change adaptation efforts (Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018; Kupika et
al. 2019) and the need for it has been acknowledged by the UN system
(Kupika et al. 2019; Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018) including the IPCC
(Vargas 2019; Rarai et al. 2022) and the scientific community (Makondo
and Thomas 2018; Ingty 2017; Nunn et al. 2024).

Finally, the 71 papers implicitly draw on the research approach required
to facilitate the bridging of IK and scientific knowledge. This enquiry
leads to literature, away from the suite of 71 papers but crucial for
bridging IK and scientific knowledge, to approaches like Two-Eyed Seeing
which was introduced by elders of the Mi'kmaq Indigenous tribe in Canada
in 2004, Albert Marshall and Murdena Marshall (Wright et al. 2019).
Bartlett et al. (2012) in a paper co-authoring the two Mi'kmaq elders,
explains TwoEyed Seeing as "learning to see from one eye with the
strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the
other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing,
and to using both these eyes together, for the benefit of all" (Bartlett
et al. 2012, p. 335). The approach attempts to address the concern noted
by Nadasdy (1999, p. 15) that "the goal of knowledgeintegration forces
TEK researchers to compartmentalise and distil Aboriginal people's
beliefs, values, and experiences according to external criteria of
relevance, seriously distorting them in the process." Two-Eyed Seeing
emphasizes weaving of perspectives with both knowledge systems having
equal importance where researchers are encouraged to learn weaving back
and forth between Indigenous and Western ontologies, epistemologies, and
methodologies (Bartlett et al. 2012). Two-Eyed Seeing approach can help
in bridging the gap of understanding by bringing together Indigenous and
Western worldviews in a collaborative and equitable approach to research
(Bartlett et al. 2012). Similarly, other culturally appropriate
approaches include Knowledge Weaving/Braiding, and Bridging Knowledge
Systems (Stirling et al. 2023). Other Solutions Across the 71 papers,
[[a wide range of solutions for maximising]{.mark} the use of
[IK]{.mark} in enhancing climate adaptation and resilience were
suggested.]{.underline} These included [mainstreaming IK, new approaches
to development, inv[olving Indigenous communities in
policy]{.mark},]{.underline} investing in agriculture, empowering
governance institutions, awareness creation, intergenerational
transmission of IK, and using some other specific innovative approaches.
These are discussed in turn.

Mainstreaming IK can involve multiple dimensions and engage systematic
approaches. The first step towards mainstreaming IK is to begin by
documenting it (Clissold et al. 2023; Filho et al. 2023) as IK plays a
crucial role in shaping human perceptions and developing adaptation
strategies (Chaudhary et al. 2021; Filho et al. 2022; Granderson 2017;
Hiwasaki et al. 2015[). [Effective Indigenous practices can]{.mark} [be
identified]{.mark}, documented and incorporated [into formal adaptation
strategies]{.mark} and made available to policymakers, planners, and
local communities]{.underline} (Filho et al. 2022; Mwaniki and Stevenson
2017; Nunn et al. 2024) in developing sustainable alternatives (Amare
2018). Zougmoréet al. (2023) posit that having an inventory of the most
efficient and successful cases of IK-based adaptation will help inform
policies

[[Involving Indigenous communities in climate-related policy]{.mark}
making [is crucial to]{.mark} capitalise on IK in [building adaptation
and resilience]{.mark} to climate change]{.underline}. [It [requires an
inclusive approach]{.mark} to decision-making, planning, and management
of climate policies]{.underline} (Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018; Mangada
2021; Sakapaji 2022; Tsosie 2019; Vargas 2019; Wekesa et al. 2015) and
to shift the focus to a bottomup approach (Inaotombi and Mahanta 2018;
Mangada 2021; Mensah et al. 2020; Amare 2018) and in engaging multiple
stakeholders (Mangada 2021; Amare 2018). Hooli (2016, p. 698) contend
that it is "very difficult or even impossible" to find sustainable
solutions to local socio-ecological challenges without the full
participation of local stakeholders. Datta and Kairy (2024) suggest
restructuring adaptation strategies for Indigenous people is critical to
address the distinct vulnerabilities and cultural context which is only
possible by involving Indigenous people in the process of drafting
policy. [[Effective]{.mark} Indigenous [practices can be]{.mark}
identified and documented [through]{.mark} [collaboration]{.mark} with
local and religious leaders, agriculture extension officers, and
scientists [and]{.mark} it can then be [integrated into formal
adaptation strategies]{.mark} and made accessible to policymakers,
planners, and communities]{.underline} (Mwaniki and Stevenson 2017).
Even at the macro level, [[including Indigenous people]{.mark} in
government programmes [will]{.mark} directly [translate into better
climate services]{.mark} as IK represents local needs more efficiently
and policy makers can make more informed decisions]{.underline} (Mangada
2021; Tsosie 2019; Vargas 2019; Wekesa et al. 2015). I[K [informed
policy decisions]{.mark} can [play a crucial role in]{.mark} developing
[sustainable solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kahlon and Singh 2021;
Sakapaji 2022; Datta and Kairy 2024). [An effective way of including
Indigenous people is for the government to work closely with
organisations, associations and groups of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (Kaganzi et al. 2021). As such, it is important
that government offices and donor agencies refrain from imposing the
nature of development for Indigenous communities and rather engage them
to draft developmental agendas and policies when it comes to building
adaptation and resilience to climate change (Mangada 2021).

#### Only dialogue and cooperation with those closest to the land can provide the necessary information to effectively mitigate climate change

[[When tracking climate change]{.mark} in the Arctic, [scientists rely
not just on satellites and software]{.mark} [but]{.mark} tap the
[knowledge of indigenous hunters]{.mark} who have lived in the frozen
north for generations.]{.underline}

To help them understand shifts underway in parts of the far north,
including the increasing frequency of disasters, [[NASA]{.mark} Emeritus
[Scientist]{.mark} Nancy Maynard and her team are [work]{.mark}ing [with
reindeer herders]{.mark} in Scandinavia [to track changing temperature
and precipitation patterns.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"They are out on the tundra year round, so they are able to give us
information on the state of the snow that we wouldn't be able to get
otherwise," Maynard told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Such on-the-ground data allows scientists such as Maynard to calibrate
satellite censors used to track weather patterns.

[[Indigenous]{.mark} people are often particularly hit by disasters and
climate change, and their [knowledge is becoming increasingly important
in mitigating the problems]{.mark}]{.underline}, scientists and
activists said.

The United Nations has designated October 13 as the International Day of
Disaster Reduction, with a focus on how indigenous knowledge can
complement science to boost resilience as the costs of disasters rise.

"It's definitely a two-way street," when it comes to data sharing in the
face of climate change, Maynard said.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed that view.

["[In the Arctic]{.mark} region, [we depend greatly on]{.mark} the
[local knowledge]{.mark} of indigenous peoples [to understand the
impacts of climate change,"]{.mark}]{.underline} he said in a statement.

"What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic."

There were three times as many natural disasters from 2000 to 2009 as
there were from 1980 to 1989, with much of the increase coming from
"climate-related events", according to a 2013 study from the New England
Journal of Medicine.

"We have seen the destruction of communities because of the loss of sea
ice, melting permafrost (and) wildfires," said Patricia Cochran,
executive director of the Alaska Native Science Commission.

"A lot of the native villages in Alaska are being literally washed into
the sea," Cochran said, citing rising water levels and the melting of
Arctic ice floes.

["[The best information and solutions come from the sharing of
information from people closest to the land,]{.mark}"]{.underline} she
added.

More than 30 communities in Alaska alone need to be moved as a result of
rising sea levels, melting ice and other factors, Maynard noted.

Various levels of government are struggling with how to finance the
moves, along with other practical considerations such as who should be
moved first, she said.

Providing resources for communities to adapt to these sorts of changes
should be a focus for national governments and the United Nations,
Maynard said.

"We take Indigenous consultation very seriously," the woman shared.
Alone at my table, I looked over to her group of five who were getting
acquainted over lunch. We had the same idea, to sneak away during a
break at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjavik, Iceland, and get some
work done. As they chatted over coffee, I couldn't help but notice that
although their conversation was focused on Indigenous consultations, not
one person in their group was native. Their conversation mirrored many I
had that weekend: [**[Indigenous communities are a]{.mark} key

clear**, and involve municipal, state, provincial and federal agents.
**Often these [jurisdictions' goals are misaligned]{.mark}** and out of
sync **with those of the Indigenous community**]{.underline}. Lobbyists
and the private sector only add to the complexity. One year ago in the
northern United States, the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Standing Rock
Sioux Reservation were at the forefront of international media.
Thousands of activists flooded the protest camp, celebrities from Katy
Perry to Leonardo DiCaprio tweeted support for the Native American
community and celebrated when the Army Corps of Engineers would not
grant an easement in December 2016. One month later, a new president
took office and the decision was reversed, giving way to the pipeline's
completion. If you visit the Dakota Access Pipeline website, the
corporate interests promote it as a win for the community as it is not
located on Standing Rock tribal lands (it was never planned to; the
issue for the community was about water). If you were to ask the owners
of the pipeline, they will tell you they consulted with Standing Rock.
If you ask Standing Rock leadership, they will tell you the owners did
not. Clearly their **[ideas on what consultation is do not
align]{.underline}**. [Indigenous leaders have been calling for
nation-to-nation discussions on environment and economic issues for
decades]{.underline}. [In countries like Canada]{.underline}, where they
have some legal precedent on their side, [Indigenous communities are
usually invited to the table. But that is where the support often
ends.]{.underline} Giving Indigenous communities full sovereignty over
their traditional lands is not something even the most progressive
government will do[. Consult? Yes. Grant veto power? No.]{.underline}
There are, however, examples of meaningful consultation. The Alaska
Whaling Commission, a coalition of Inuit subsistence hunters, has
supported research on the bowhead whale in collaboration with the United
States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is one of
several instances where [government agencies have benefitted from the
traditional knowledge of Inuit in Alaska, where communities aid in
research; monitor salmon and whales; and consult on lease
agreements]{.underline}. [The majority of effective consultation
projects are research-based between governments and Indigenous
communities. It is more difficult once private sector investment enters
the picture and profits are on the line]{.underline}. With melting polar
ice and the opening of new shipping passageways in the Arctic,
[investment is finding its way north]{.underline}. With billions of
dollars on the table, [it's hard for governments to turn down economic
investment, let alone listen to a small group of Indigenous people
asking to continue living their traditional way of life. **[True
consultation means granting Indigenous communities full authority to say
no to]{.mark} economic [development]{.mark} on their land**. Without
this power balance and authentic dialogue, participants are simply
inviting Indigenous communities to the table and asking them to sign on
the dotted line]{.underline}.

territory under the guise of "good development" justifies colonial

//AChiong

Of all sectors of society that have historically been marginalized or
effectively excluded from development planning and policymaking,
indigenous peoples represent the group that poses the most complex
challenges.

According to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues,
there are 370 million indigenous people in the world who to varying
degrees "have retained social, cultural, economic and political
characteristics that are distinct from those of the dominant societies
in which they live." However, maintaining these attributes has been very
difficult because [many nations continue to enforce assimilation
policies, principally in [the name of development]{.mark}
--]{.underline} for the benefit of all.

[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} assimilation of native populations [may be
a [well-intentioned]{.mark} objective of the countries that have
engulfed these groups, [it is debatable whether indigenous peoples
desire]{.mark} the type of social inclusion that [development]{.mark} in
its varied forms can create]{.underline}. Development is a mixed
blessing. Nevertheless, reality dictates that development is inevitable,
and that resistance to it would likely bring about consequences far more
adverse than those brought forth by acquiescence.

In an increasingly globalized world[, maintaining the delicate balance
between freedom and development is even more challenging for indigenous
people because [development]{.mark} typically [entails significant
natural resource exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline} In regions where
their ancestral lands are rich in these coveted resources, [[indigenous
people are]{.mark} often [viewed as obstacles]{.mark} and impediments
[to progress.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Problems arise as lands are claimed by nation-states without regard for
the indigenous populations that rely on open access to these tracts for
their livelihood. Land use rights for the native people range from
limited rights to none at all, yet without those rights, indigenous
people cannot engage in the development process.

[Opposite to the accepted views of the industrialized world, to the
[indigenous]{.mark} people, their [environment is not a "grocery store
at the service of men."]{.mark} Nor are land and its resources seen as
economic assets; [they are the very foundation of life]{.mark}.
Development [planners]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, have
[[systematically disregarded]{.mark} the [cultural context]{.mark} that
distinguishes indigenous perspective from the Western.]{.underline}
Consequently, the struggle for land recognition and territorial autonomy
faces a complicated path forward as it strives to reach an equitable
resolution.

Though development has brought about some undeniable gains, it has not
been beneficial to indigenous peoples across all regions of the Far
North. [[Native]{.mark} groups [may wish to share in the
benefits]{.mark} of the modern world [to varying degrees]{.mark}, but
many [nation-states]{.mark} continue to [ignore]{.mark} the capacity of
[indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} to formulate their own
conceptions of development and devise strategies for carrying them out.
Despite the growing number of prominent indigenous intellectuals and
politicians, [the idea is still widespread that indigenous peoples do
not have a comprehensive understanding of the Western system of
values]{.underline}. Even more detrimental is [[the presumption
that]{.mark} a [Western lifestyle is superior]{.mark} to their
"primitive" traditional ways.]{.underline} The result is that
consideration is rarely given to the idea that native people should have
the option to choose whether or not to adopt it.

The Inuit people, whose communities are scattered across northern
Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and the Chukotka region of eastern
Siberia, are often regarded as "guardians of the Arctic," yet each of
these groups faces its own unique challenges.

After being accused of ignoring the human development of Inuit
populations who lived within its borders during the time of
colonization, Canada devised an ideologically-slanted strategy for Inuit
development. Although the Inuit eventually achieved a pseudo-Western
standard of living, the direct result of material improvement was
cultural impoverishment. Even in rare cases where native people escaped
material deprivation -- alcoholism, prostitution, obesity, and alarming
rates of suicide among young people have been prevalent conditions.

In Canada and Greenland alike, efforts to assimilate Inuit into
mainstream national society involved coercing tent and igloo-dwellers to
give up their nomadic lifestyles and move to fixed settlements, with
promises of security, reliable access to food, medical care and formal
education. Well-meaning as these relocation efforts may have been, they
nevertheless disconnected the Inuit from their traditional ways of life,
which in turn led to a loss of self-identity. The ultimate side-effect
of this process was that it forced the newly "civilized" hunters and
their families to almost exclusively rely on government assistance,
perpetuating the decline of self-worth.

In 2008, Greenland's referendum on greater autonomy from Denmark was
approved and Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under
international law. At present, international relations are largely left
to the discretion of Greenland's government. While Denmark still
provides a substantial subsidy, that amount will gradually diminish as
Greenland begins to collect revenues from the sale of its natural
resources.

To many international investors, Greenland is seen as "the last
frontier" and a resource bonanza. Though the Greenland Inuit welcome the
possibility of economic opportunities, they are understandably skeptical
of multinational interest in their natural resources, such as
large-scale mining operations, which they know will have social,
economic and environmental consequences. Additionally, the disappearance
of sea ice could drastically change the composition of the circumpolar
region by introducing new trade routes and increasing outside corporate
investment. Collectively, these conditions pose ever-growing threats to
the Greenland's environment. Because they understand that they will be
living with the direct effects of potentially large scale development,
Greenland Inuit are seeking a larger role in the international
decision-making process.

Despite regaining a high degree of control over their lands and
embracing opportunities to create self-sustaining economies, [[most
Inuit]{.mark} still [face an uncertain future]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Taking into account the impacts of climate and societal change,
controversial hunting policies and regulations, compounded by global
environmental pressures and uncertainty about the consequences of
resource exploitation, [the [peoples of the Arctic]{.mark} seem to be
[on the verge of]{.mark} profound [culture shock.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Therefore, [the ramifications of fostering a capitalistic system [should
be carefully considered in]{.mark} the planning of [development]{.mark}
strategies [across the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} As one example,
within the framework of indigenous communities, monetary income can only
be used for the procurement of food and technology from the outside
world. Though these goods are needed, they also [[weaken]{.mark} the
[traditional bond]{.mark} the native people have [with their
environment]{.mark}, thereby [amplifying external
dependency.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Elsewhere, particularly in the northern reaches of Russia, [massive
investment by numerous international oil consortia has created one of
the world's largest oil and gas industries]{.underline}. Until
relatively recently, the indigenous people in these regions had managed
to peacefully exist outside a political system in which economic
development presumed the imagined consent of indigenous populations.
However, due to external political pressure to include indigenous
communities in their exploits, the energy companies are insisting on
holding regular public meetings with the local people as a new form of
"public relations." [The [indigenous people]{.mark} across Siberia [are
granted token privileges under]{.mark} the [guise of fair
compensation]{.mark} as barter for exploitation of their ancestral lands
-- all in the name of development]{.underline}. Western ideology is
forced on these native communities as a matter of course, [[under the
pretense of "lifestyle improvement and
modernization.]{.underline}"]{.mark} From their own perspective,
however, the native groups feel that they are little more than ornaments
to capital investment rather than symbols of a social system that
promotes and ensures equity.

Though the concept has many connotations, when viewed through the scope
of Western universalism, the term ["development" frequently carries
overtones of pretentiousness and arrogance.]{.underline} Furthermore,
elitist leaders who choose to validate their political and economic
claims [by [using the rhetoric of]{.mark} [environmentalism and
branding]{.mark} their activity [as "sustainable development]{.mark}"
whilst [ignor]{.mark}ing [the ability of indigenous peoples to advance
the process through]{.mark} active [participation and traditional
knowledge]{.mark},]{.underline} are irresponsibly [[pushing]{.mark}
entire [societies into]{.mark} new conditions of cultural [poverty and
even extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Instead of imposing on them models of development that are alien to
these groups[, [it is imperative that]{.mark} the [opinions of]{.mark}
the [native]{.mark} people [are]{.mark} not only [given voice at]{.mark}
their respective [government's tables]{.mark} but that [their right to
self-determination is respected. Saying "no"]{.mark} to certain aspects
of development [should]{.mark} also [be a]{.mark}n indigenous
[prerogative.]{.mark} Only if and [when native]{.mark} people [are
involved]{.mark} in the process will [development]{.mark} in all its
iterations [have the best chance for success.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Achieving these goals will require a drastic attitude shift on the part
of policymakers and planners, and should include acknowledgement [that
[traditional knowledge must b]{.mark}e an [integral]{.mark} part of
development where it impacts indigenous communities.]{.underline} The
main objective is to not only enable but to empower indigenous peoples
to establish -- for themselves and their nation-states -- the best means
of interaction that secures their traditional heritage and supports
their cultural survival within the context of a contemporary world.

[[Indigenous]{.mark} peoples across the globe [lay claim to an ancient
ethic of responsibility]{.mark} toward the environment and all the
creatures that thrive in it.]{.underline} They have survived for
thousands of years by respecting nature and [[living sustainably in a
symbiotic relationship]{.mark} with it]{.underline}. That fragile
age-old balance is now under threat. In their inevitable collision with
mainstream culture, native people face the prospect of a potential
tragedy, namely that they could choose to set aside that traditional
ethic, and risk destroying the resource base upon which their cultures
was built. Yet even through their struggle for self-determination,
[[they have much to teach us about]{.mark} human nature and quite
possibly about [the fate of humanity]{.mark} as a whole.]{.underline}

[[We]{.mark} in the allegedly more "civilized" world [should not be
presumptuous]{.mark} nor brazen [enough to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[speak
on their behalf]{.underline}]{.mark} nor act as their ambassadors. [[We
cannot know what is best for indigenous peoples. Our obligation is
to]{.mark} respectfully [offer them an equal place at the
decision-making table -- for the benefit of all.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Indigenous people may or may not benefit from the implementation of the plan, but [consultation is key]{.underline} to establish [respect]{.underline}.

[Third, [there is a place for Indigenous economic participation]{.mark}
in resource development, at least in circumstances like those [in Arctic
contexts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Surprisingly, although a new wave of
writing in this area is beginning to address the issues, there has been
relatively little political theory work done on just allocations of
resource ownership and resource proceeds.250 Thus, there is still no
consensus amongst political theorists on just allocations in relation to
resources.251

At the same time, there is evidence that the perceived legitimacy of a
resource allocation by potential stakeholders can significantly affect
their acceptance of the allocation and, thus, the stability of that
allocation in circumstances where those stakeholders have any form of
power over it.252 [Therefore, as a practical matter, even in the face of
deeper uncertainties, [there could be]{.mark} arguments for developing
interim [arrangements that respect viable positions on resource
allocations]{.mark}.]{.underline}253

Regardless, despite a broader lack of consensus, the circumstances of
Arctic Indigenous communities may fit a special category of cases.254
[Where a geographic region is relatively unpopulated but for a
particular community and where the impacts of resource development would
fall on that community, there is a strong case for at least some measure
of economic participation by that community in the development. At a
minimum, there must be sufficient economic participation so as to
provide something to offset the negative impacts on the
community.]{.underline} [However, there is also probably an argument for
the only population of the region due to its connection with the
resources in that area to receive some benefits that support its public
governmental order. This last statement recognizes an [inevitable public
dimension to authorization of resource extraction]{.mark}. Where there
is only one community in an area --- with matters obviously being more
complicated in the context of an existing Indigenous community along
with a significant non-Indigenous community --- then [that community may
properly benefit from the resource extraction]{.mark} that takes place
in that area.]{.underline}255

[[Thus]{.mark}, when considering interim theory implementation,
development of practical arrangements that meet legitimacy expectations,
and recognition of a specialized category of case into which Arctic
Indigenous communities will fit, [there are reasons to include economic
participation of Arctic Indigenous communities]{.mark} in resource
development amongst the practices to be followed.]{.underline}

Fourth, this last point gives rise to one specific comment on some
different Arctic states' practices detailed in Part II.256 This Article
also comments on these practices in Part V,257 with the added context of
the impact categories from Part IV.258 [The [purpose of consultation and
participation is to respect Indigenous communities rather than to force
changes]{.mark} upon them, since any compelled changes actually
undermine some of the purposes of consultation and
participation.]{.underline}259 [It is preferable to achieve consultation
and participation in ways that do not undermine culturally significant
governance structures within Indigenous communities]{.underline}.
Considering some of the practices in the different states examined in
Part II, they show examples pertinent to this point and will help to
lead toward the fifth principle.

Some of the states discussed in Part II --- notably the United States in
the Alaskan context260 --- would appear to have developed broader
economic participation policies than a number of the other states
without engaging in as much actual consultation with Indigenous
communities.261 This choice may partly reflect a value system of
American free market capitalism, which is not necessarily at odds with
the values of many American Indian communities.262 [[Closer attention to
consultation]{.mark} policies vis-à-vis Alaskan Indigenous communities
[might or might not reveal the same values]{.mark} in these
communities.]{.underline}263

If such differences existed, it would raise the question of whether
propelling cultural change in these communities is justified --- some
may respond that American liberalism advances universal values of
freedom and rightly pushes cultural change on other systems of human
governance.264 However, if that is indeed the underlying policy, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has not been forthright about its
policies]{.mark} and has instead seemingly operated in such a manner to
respect Indigenous cultural choices, often rooted in Indigenous
spirituality and religious values. [If the United States is not going to
respect]{.mark} Indigenous cultural choices [then a larger debate should
be had]{.mark} forthrightly rather than through half policies [under the
guise of respecting consultation principles.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Prior consultation is key for [culturally appropriate and understanding]{.underline} relationships.

3.3.2 Sufficient time before decisions about the activity are made

[Another aspect of ['prior' consultation is that indigenous peoples and
communities]{.mark} are able to provide their [view on the potential
impacts and benefits of proposed activities]{.mark} sufficiently [in
advance of their start.]{.mark}]{.underline}112 [Indigenous peoples need
time to get to know the issues involved in a proposed activity, develop
trust and build relationships with the people involved, discuss proposed
activities among themselves and with others, and plan and assess the
potential opportunities and impacts of an activity. [Sufficient time
is]{.mark} also [necessary before]{.mark} meetings that constitute
[formal consultations]{.mark}.]{.underline}113 This is an important
precondition for indigenous relations to be informed.

[According to the UN Guidelines on FPIC, '[prior' includes respect for
time requirements]{.mark} of indigenous consultation or consensus
processes]{.underline}.114 [The time that an indigenous group requires
to determine whether proposed activities may affect their rights or
interests will depend on, among other things, the project, the capacity
of the indigenous group, their prior experience reviewing similar
projects, accessibility of information, the ability of the group to come
to some consensus about the potential risks and their cultural
traditions.]{.underline} As explained by one Canadian tribal council,
'it can take at least 180 days and often much longer for a First Nation
to understand how a project under review might impact Aboriginal rights
and title'.115 Although outside entities may accrue financial costs from
a protracted engagement process, this price 'is likely to be small
compared to those stemming from an inadequate engagement
process'.116 Indeed, as some companies recognize, '\[e\]ngagement and
relationship-building are an investment, not a cost'.117 [[Laws and
policies]{.mark} that provide for project approval timelines [should
explicitly incorporate adequate time for indigenous
relations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

3.4 Informed

[One of the fundamental tenants of relations with indigenous peoples is
that it be informed. [Information sharing during consultation should
be]{.mark} a balanced and [reciprocal process]{.mark} that allows groups
to make informed input on activities, [supports mutual understanding and
ensures]{.mark} all parties have the [same level of knowledge]{.mark}.
Indigenous peoples must have adequate knowledge and resources to
participate in the consultation process.]{.underline}118 Outside
entities must also have adequate information about indigenous peoples
and indigenous knowledge to conduct successful activities in the Arctic.
As the Inter-American Human Rights Court also explained, indigenous
people must be adequately informed of the possible risks so that the
proposed activities are knowingly or voluntarily accepted.119

3.4.1 Culturally appropriate and accessible

[Information must be culturally appropriate and accessible,]{.underline}
as highlighted by UN recommendations and guidelines for
researchers.120 In addition, efforts to engage with indigenous peoples
should take into account the community\'s other activities that could
impact participation and engagement, such as other meetings of
importance, special community events and gatherings, and local
communities' harvesting, hunting and fishing schedules.121 [Arctic
Council recommendations stress the importance of ensuring that
scientific, human development, economic and health information is
accessible to communities.]{.underline}122 [[As the]{.mark}
[A]{.mark}rctic [O]{.mark}ffshore [O]{.mark}il and [G]{.mark}as
[Guidelines point out]{.mark}, one way [to improve]{.mark} the
[accessibility]{.mark} of information [is to communicate in culturally
appropriate ways and in local languages.]{.mark}]{.underline}123

[Cultural awareness underlies the understanding of how to communicate in
culturally appropriate ways. [Cultural awareness can also provide a
basis for more equitable relationships and guide the development of
activities.]{.mark} For example, the Alaskan Inuit Food Security
Conceptual Framework provides a platform for understanding food security
from an indigenous peoples' perspective and can help outsiders
understand how to develop activities in partnership with Inuit [to
achieve mutual benefits.]{.mark}]{.underline}124

Training programmes and manuals can provide companies, researchers and
government officials with information about cross-cultural communication
and sensitivity.125 [Outside organizations also gain cultural awareness
by spending time in the community and reviewing information about it,
especially information that is created by the indigenous peoples
themselves.]{.underline}126 For example, the Assembly of Alaska Native
Educators has created guidelines for respecting cultural knowledge,
which apply to native elders, authors and illustrators, curriculum
developers and administrators, educators, editors and publishers,
document reviewers, researchers, native language specialists, native
community organizations and the general public.127 [Government policies
should recommend that decision makers become familiar with the
indigenous peoples they will be working with, including their culture
and history.]{.underline}128

Bridging the divide between cultural differences can be challenging,
because of the different approaches that cultures have to appropriate
ways to communicate, collaborate, gain knowledge and become a meaningful
contributor.129 Education, frequent, ongoing and informal interaction,
and coproduced research can help to bridge these divides.130

Information should also be made more accessible by developing web-based
databases that can include material about laws related to indigenous
rights, territory and culture. In Canada, for example, the Aboriginal
and Treaty Rights Information System (ATRIS) database has information
organized by GIS (geographic information system) and subject, and
contains extensive information on national laws, treaties, indigenous
policies and other information that is essential for indigenous
relations.

3.4.2 Transparent and adequately funded

When an organization proposes to conduct activities in the Arctic, it
will typically provide indigenous peoples with, at a minimum, a
description of the activity, the purpose, the location and people likely
to be affected, the potential environmental, economic social, and
cultural benefits and impacts, and the proposed timeline for the
project.131 In addition to this information, researchers also provide
data-gathering techniques, funding sources and institutional
affiliations.132 The objective is to ensure that the information
provided is 'in sufficient form and detail to allow that party to
prepare its views on the matter'.133

[Transparency includes candid disclosures.]{.underline} Thus, for
example, indigenous peoples have requested that the government provide
all the information it has that both supports and questions the basis
for granting approval for a proposed project.134 [[When organizations
provide full disclosures]{.mark} about the proposed activities and
anticipated benefits and impacts, [this mitigates the risk of
misleading]{.mark} indigenous peoples and communities, [which could
damage long-term relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline}135 For example,
Conservation International has committed to engage indigenous
communities in a transparent, honest way and to directly inform others
of its mission and primary emphasis on biodiversity conservation, so
that there is 'no misunderstanding about motives'.136

[Upon receiving this initial information about a proposed project,
indigenous peoples and communities can identify any additional
information that will be needed to assess the full impacts and potential
benefits. Indigenous peoples face ever-increasing demands to become
engaged in activities that range significantly in size, scope and
comprehensiveness of required review.]{.underline}137 For the engagement
to be meaningful, indigenous peoples and communities must have
sufficient capacity, including time, staff and an ability to develop or
assess information about the proposed activities.138 [Thus, some
indigenous peoples and communities specifically identify their capacity
needs for the proposed project by creating a budget and plan for
developing information, including the time it will take for the
indigenous organization to provide a complete assessment of potential
impacts to its interests or rights and possible benefits and
opportunities.]{.underline}139 The budget will sometimes also address
additional costs, such as participation in environmental impact studies.
Alternatively, budgets for other costs of engagement are developed at a
later point in time.140 It is important for all parties to understand
that these costs are not related to compensation for impacts, nor are
they access fees for permission to conduct activities on indigenous
lands.

Parties should ensure that adequate funding is available for indigenous
peoples to participate fully.141 As the Hul\'qumi\'num First Nation
explains, 'the duty to consult and accommodate necessarily includes an
obligation to ensure adequate and sustained funding' for indigenous
peoples to meaningfully participate.142

Outside entities and indigenous peoples should work together to identify
how to meet indigenous peoples' financial costs of engagement.143 For
example, to make capacity building and technical advice as unbiased as
possible, companies have placed funds in escrow accounts that
communities can use to hire advisors of their choosing.144 Once their
assessment is complete, indigenous peoples and communities can
contribute to informed consultation by clearly outlining their views
about the potential adverse impacts on indigenous rights or interests as
well as the potential benefits and opportunities.145

Various legal obligations require governments and companies to assess
the potential impacts of proposed activities to indigenous peoples.
International standards also impose this obligation on
companies.146 These analyses may occur, for example, through social
impact assessments (SIAs). In Sweden, SIAs have emerged as part of the
EIA process, in particular for projects that affect reindeer husbandry
and Saami communities.147 In Greenland, the Mineral License and Safety
Authority has developed SIA guidelines for mining projects.148 In
Canada, the government conducted a socio-economic assessment for
proposed marine protected areas in the Beaufort Sea.149

Ultimately, consent cannot be informed if it is given without a full
understanding of the nature of the activities and the potential impacts.
Thus, it will likely be insufficient for companies and governments to
merely provide information, no matter how culturally sensitive it is.
When engagement is driven primarily by the objective of legal
compliance, it is often reduced to discrete consultation meetings
related to environmental and social assessment. Consultation that is
conducted merely to meet the legally required minimum legal standards
usually does not extend beyond the project planning phase and rarely
leads to effective or constructive relationships.150 Providing and
requesting feedback on whether activities and projects are following the
agreed upon plan, and on the effectiveness of the engagement process
being used, helps parties to identify where modifications should be made
and reinforce accessibility of participation for indigenous peoples.151

3.5 Consensus or consent?

Although indigenous relations practices in the Arctic have incorporated
the concepts of free, prior and informed to a significant degree, the
issue of consent is more contentious. Many practices instead focus more
on consensus, or a good faith effort to reach consensus.

3.5.1 Good faith effort to reach consensus

[[Indigenous relations must be 'more than sitting there and
listening'.]{.underline}]{.mark}152 Rather, meaningful engagement
includes taking action in response to the information learned from the
relationship.153 Thus, if the engagement process affects the ultimate
decision, it has been at least successful to some degree. [However, in a
study of indigenous and government views on successful consultation
throughout the US (including non-Arctic regions), all parties agreed
that coming to consensus was not critical. Although consensus is one of
the products of successful consultation, most of the people surveyed
stressed that '[fundamental success lay in]{.mark} incrementally
building [open communication, and mutual respect and
understanding'.]{.mark}]{.underline}154

Indigenous relations are also more meaningful if all parties engage with
the intent of finding a mutually agreeable resolution to
concerns.155 The Inter-American Human Rights Court in the Sarayaku case
emphasized the importance of good faith on the part of both
sides.156 From the perspective of the entity desiring to conduct
activities in the Arctic, this is also understood as consultation with
the objective of seeking consent, which is aimed at 'avoiding the
imposition of the will of one party over the other, and at instead
striving for mutual understanding and consensual
decision-making'.157 ILO Convention No. 169 specifies that consultation
should take place 'with the objective of achieving agreement or consent
to the proposed measures'.158 Some national policies also emphasize the
importance of consensus.159

For indigenous peoples and communities, good faith consultation includes
agreeing to participate in discussions, identifying the mitigation they
seek and making an effort to reconcile competing interests.160 The
obligation to reach consensus is complicated by the power dynamics that
often exist in indigenous relations. When indigenous peoples are at a
disadvantage, for example, because of legal, capacity, vulnerability or
other factors, the unequal positions of power may result in indigenous
peoples placing less emphasis on consensus. In all cases, the objective
of reconciling competing interests should be subjugated to the need to
protect indigenous rights. For governments, the objective of reaching
consensus is complicated by the government\'s responsibility to take
broader societal interests into account.161 Although most rights are not
absolute, it is unlikely that even a 'compelling and substantial public
interest' can justify a significant infringement of indigenous land
rights.162

One way to reconcile indigenous peoples' concerns is through mitigation
and accommodation.163 Mitigation is more likely to be successful if it
is built into the initial project design, rather than added as a
reaction to impacts that have already occurred. Addressing a priority
issue identified by the indigenous peoples or community provides an
incentive for indigenous peoples to engage. In addition, a mutually
agreeable solution can best be achieved when information provided by
indigenous peoples and communities is utilized through a collaborative
process throughout all stages of the activity, including the design,
development, implementation and revision of activities.164

If impacts cannot be mitigated, companies may decide to forgo the
proposed project. [However, when impacts cannot be mitigated but a
project proceeds, international norms require indigenous peoples to be
compensated.]{.underline}165 Some countries have implemented this
measure at a national level. For example, in Canada, under the Nunavut
Land Claim Agreement, developers are liable for damage to wildlife
harvesting of indigenous peoples, to water quality or quantity and
expropriation of land, and must pay compensation for these
damages.166 The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) has identified factors
to be considered for compensation to indigenous peoples for loss of
natural resources and habitat.167

When an entity ensures that indigenous peoples have consented to the
activity, the appropriate compensation will likely be included as part
of the granting of consent. Where entities do not ensure consent before
proceeding with their activities, the issue of determining whether and
how much compensation is warranted remains in the hands of the
government or the corporation. Thus, as discussed in more detail below,
consent is a key aspect of indigenous relations.

3.5.2 Consent

Among governments in the Arctic, 'the language and cultural rights of
Indigenous peoples are increasingly recognized while a question of land
rights remains the subject of a debate'.168 Thus, the issue of consent,
which is based in the interconnection of these rights, is also the
subject of debate in the region. [[Under a 'spectrum analysis']{.mark},
where the proposed activity implicates rights that are essential to the
survival of the indigenous peoples or where the impacts on indigenous
rights are significant, [consent is
necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline}169 The Inter-American Court on Human
Rights found that with respect to large-scale development or investment
projects that could have a major impact within an indigenous peoples'
territory, the State has a duty to not only consult with the indigenous
peoples, but to also obtain their FPIC based on their customs and
traditions.170

projects, the earliest opportunity to begin indigenous relations is
before a project is planned, and certainly before activities start. Some
researchers seek consent before submitting applications for funding a
project in an indigenous community. Companies can also begin indigenous
relations, as well as an assessment of the project's potential impacts
and benefits, as early as possible.

[N]{.mark}ations [Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 1 As a cornerstone of US efforts to
implement this declaration, Indigenous consultation laws allow
Indigenous people to directly participate in decisions that affect their
lives, from health to education to resource management. [**[The US
government requires federal agencies to consult]{.mark}** with tribal
nations before implementing policies that have a tribal implication. 2
**[However, less is known about the degree]{.mark} to [which]{.mark}
laws in US [states]{.mark} and territories**]{.underline} (hereinafter,
"states") **[require [consult]{.mark}ation with Indigenous
communities]{.underline}** (i.e., communities present in the United
States before the arrival of European settlers). Indigenous communities
have historically engaged in diplomatic relationships with the United
States 3 through treaty making, which inherently acknowledged tribal
sovereignty. [As **[paternalistic policies]{.mark}** in the United
States increased, diplomacy gave way to a nation-within-a-nation model
that **[prioritize]{.mark}d [federal
decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4,5 The American Indian Movement
advocated for increased self-determination in the 1970s, 6 and in the
1980s global Indigenous communities advocated for passage of
International Labor Organization Convention 169, which disallowed
assimilationist policies from signatories. 7 Colonization, a distal
determinant of health for Indigenous communities, 8 disenfranchised
Indigenous voices, but modern Indigenous advocacy efforts have led
states to develop state-level Indigenous consultation laws. Although
**[Indigenous consultation [laws lack uniformity]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
all jurisdictions that have state or federally recognized Indigenous
communities located within their territorial boundaries have at least 1
Indigenous consultation law. However, [the **[lack of
standardization]{.mark} has [resulted in variations in the ability of
Indigenous people to engage in decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although Indigenous consultation under international law is
aspirational, certain key principles have emerged. First, [**[a]{.mark}
mutually [agreeable decision]{.mark} [requires]{.mark} a [good-faith
effort]{.mark}**. This means that **[consultation must occur before a
decision is made]{.mark}** 9 and full information, including
alternatives, must be provided to Indigenous communities to meet the
principle of noncoercio]{.underline}n. The final principle set out on
international free, prior, and informed consent mandates that consent be
obtained 9 ; **[[however, many]{.mark} [settler governments have been
unwilling to relinquish]{.mark} this [control when they perceive larger
benefits to society]{.mark}]{.underline}** than to Indigenous
communities. 10 The United States presently has 574 federally recognized
tribes, 11 66 state-recognized Indigenous communities, 12 and myriad
unrecognized Indigenous communities with retained ties to land and
culture. 13 Before the Clinton administration, federal consultation was
conducted on a case-by-case basis. In 1993, executive order 12866 was
issued, which mandated consultation with tribal leaders before the
imposition of regulatory requirements. 14 In 1998, executive order 13084
expanded consultation to include meaningful input on regulatory
developments. 15 Finally, in 2000, executive order 13175, the existing
consultation framework, mandated federal executive agencies to consult
with tribal leaders before issuing regulatory decisions with tribal
implications. 2 Disruptions to ways of life among Indigenous communities
after initial contact with European settlers resulted in persistent
health disparities16,17 among once-healthy communities. 18
[**Consultation reempowers Indigenous people**, redresses prior
colonialization, and is essential to improving health outcomes in
Indigenous communities]{.underline}. 19 Federal Indigenous consultation
laws are used in programmatic development, budget formulation,
environmental planning, and data classification. Through consultation,
tribes have advocated for increased federal funding for preventive care,
inclusion of traditional medicine as part of federally funded palliative
care, and improved access to Veterans Health Administration hospitals.
20 Similar to the federal government, states can use consultation to
design culturally appropriate policies and programs that address
Indigenous concerns and improve health and well-being.
[**[Without]{.mark} [comprehensive consultation policies,
decisions]{.mark} initiated by settler governments [may]{.mark}
unknowingly [harm]{.mark}** the ancestral lands, the natural and
cultural resources, and the health and well-being of Indigenous
people]{.underline}. 21 [In the absence of a robust consultation
process, the actions of jurisdictions could unknowingly and sometimes
irreparably harm **[Indigenous]{.mark} [people]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For example, because agency decision makers were uninformed about the
negative effects of using reclaimed water to make artificial snow, they
approved its use at a ski resort, resulting in a group of Navajo
medicine men being unable to gather needed medicines and ultimately
having negative effects on the health of Navajo people.

1 Introduction

This year marks the fiftieth anniversary since the first [Arctic
Peoples' Conference]{.underline} was held in 1973, at which Indigenous
Peoples1 from across the Arctic came together for the first time in an
event organised by and for themselves.2 Fifty years on, in July 2023,
that landmark moment was celebrated with another Arctic Peoples'
Conference, in Ilulissat, Greenland, the Statement from which charts a
course for Arctic Indigenous Peoples' future, including collective
engagement in international law and policy. It is thus an apt moment at
which to [reflect on the contributions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples to
[international law]{.mark}]{.underline}, and to consider the work that
still needs to be done to [meaningfully [incorporate]{.mark}
[diverse]{.mark} ways of knowing into an international legal
[framework]{.mark} steeped in colonial understandings of the
world]{.underline}, and to ensure that the [distinct rights,
perspectives, and interpretations]{.underline} of [international
law]{.underline} by [Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} are fully
understood.3

In some ways, this contribution sits uneasily within a special issue
dedicated to "interdisciplinarity in Nordic approaches to international
law". The perspectives of Indigenous Peoples are neither a discipline,
nor do their views form part of a single homogenous whole. Neither Sámi
nor Inuit4 reside exclusively within the cartographical division of a
single state, and Greenland does not really sit within the Nordic Region
at all as a matter of geography (although Danish colonisation meant that
it does as a matter of law). The homelands of Sámi and Inuit stretch
across and beyond the Nordic Region, into parts of North America and
Russia. Sámi and Inuit represent the "Arctic Region" sociocultural
grouping within the international legal order of the UN and for this
reason "Arctic Indigenous Peoples" is the expression used in this
article, rather than "Nordic".5 Yet it is important to note that Inuit
and Sámi are not the only Indigenous Peoples within the Arctic Region,
and their territories also stretch beyond it. In these and other ways,
[[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} both [transcend]{.mark} the [state-based
order]{.mark} of the [international legal system]{.mark}, and are
constrained and confined by it]{.underline}. In fact, the need to bring
Arctic Indigenous Peoples together in 1973 was partly a reaction to the
divisions imposed through the structures of international law itself.
[[Euro-centric conceptualisations]{.mark} of
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[territory]{.underline}
[demarcated boundaries]{.underline}]{.mark} in ways [[arbitrary]{.mark}
to the history]{.underline}, [heritage, languages, and families of its
indigenous inhabitants]{.underline}, and without any recognition of them
as Peoples. [Indeed, [colonialism]{.mark} was [pivotal]{.mark} to the
[formation]{.mark} of [international law]{.mark}, which "has always been
animated by the civilizing mission".6]{.underline}

Yet the invitation to contribute is important because the
[[voices]{.mark} of [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} are routinely
[misunderstood]{.mark}]{.underline}, [sidelined, marginalised, and
excluded from such discussions]{.underline}, and [[yet are
crucial]{.mark} to a complete [understanding]{.mark} of the state-based
system of [i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}]{.underline} in a Nordic
context. Nordic states are renowned champions of human rights on the
international stage, including Indigenous Peoples' rights specifically.
They are world leaders in the provision of overseas development
assistance, adept at balancing capitalist endeavours with principles of
egalitarianism and strong social security.7 [Yet Nordic championship of
the rules-based international legal order has cloaked systemic failures
to uphold those rights domestically]{.underline}, particularly for
[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}.8 This reflective article seeks to
elaborate the evolution of the [relationship between Indigenous Peoples
and international law]{.underline} in a Nordic context. From the
colonial roots of the international legal order, through which
Indigenous Peoples were at best invisible and at worst chattels, to
eventual recognition of Indigenous Peoples' existence, agency and
rights, and then the contemporary challenges of today. The selection of
examples in this article are illustrative, not exhaustive. To do justice
to the many Arctic Indigenous Peoples' interventions, initiatives,
leaders, and exemplars in international law is impossible within the
brevity of this piece. Needless to say, Arctic Indigenous Peoples have a
strong history of engagement in the formal structures of international
law-making and continue to contribute to its evolution and development,
some of which will be showcased here.

2 Traditional Exclusion

Indigenous Peoples' history began well before colonisation, including
through various treaty agreements, bilateral and multilateral agreements
with other Indigenous Nations and Peoples[. Yet the annals of
[international law]{.mark} typically [ignore]{.mark} those
[arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}, both [formally and in
scholarship]{.underline}. In the [European-styled system of
international law too, [Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples were [asserting their
sovereignty]{.mark} from the outset, although usually [without
success]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Haudenosaunee People of Canada
famously sought recognition of their sovereignty at the League of
Nations in 1923. Thereafter Indigenous Peoples have continued to pursue
participation in the creation and implementation of international law,
and recognition of their sovereignty within it. They have also been
routinely turned away, their voices and interests often deemed a matter
of domestic concern, or, worse, their existence disavowed. In 1933, the
Permanent Court of International Justice (pcij) declared the territory
of Greenland terra nullius ("land belonging to no one") prior to 1814,
and formally recognised it as part of the Danish state, ignoring
millennia of human occupation before European arrivals. In this way,
the pcij subscribed to notions that underpin the doctrine of discovery.9

The doctrine of discovery was once explained by a 19th century arbitral
tribunal as the idea that "\[c\]ountries inhabited by savage tribes may,
under well-established rules of public law, be so occupied and possessed
by the representatives of a Christian power as to dispossess the native
sovereignty and transfer it to the Christian power."10 While the tenor
of the tribunal's sentiment has troubling contemporary familiarity, it
no longer reflects the law. Much has changed since 19th century notions
of Christian elite. Still, any system the foundations of which rest on
such premises warrants ongoing reflection. In the near century since,
Indigenous Peoples have been central in not only infusing and shifting
the content of international law but also offering alternative methods
through which to understand and implement it. That is, international law
has not only been transformative for Indigenous Peoples, it has also
been transformed by Indigenous Peoples.11 Yet principles of equity
demand that the distinct cultural context of international law as it
continues to be articulated and practiced today is both recognised and
challenged by the actors and institutions within it.

In the late-1960s waves of public protest against racial segregation,
war, and imperial rule, wrested these issues onto the international
stage. Those movements emboldened minority Indigenous Peoples to
challenge settler governments in United States, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and elsewhere, and to demand official
acknowledgement of their sovereignty, land, and treaty rights.12 This
insistence on recognition as first peoples forced authorities and the
general public to reckon with history in new ways. In 1970, the UN
Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of
Minorities initiated a comprehensive study on the specific issue of
discrimination against Indigenous Peoples. The resultant reports are
central to the way in which indigeneity is understood today. They also
led to the establishment of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations
under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in 1982, and by
1985 preparation for a UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous
Peoples was underway.

In this context, Arctic Indigenous Peoples found resurgent energy for
international engagement and regional coordination, which led to the
Arctic Peoples' Conference in 1973. The Conference was significant in
itself, being the first time Arctic Indigenous Peoples had come together
to discuss their collective interests as a matter of strategic
diplomacy. It also led to the establishment of more distinct Arctic
Indigenous Peoples' Organizations, which facilitated greater
participation in international processes, both separately and
jointly.13 The Inuit Circumpolar Council was founded four years after
the conference, in 1977, with Russian Inuit joining in 1992. The Nordic
Saami Council had first been established in 1956 and later became 'the
Saami Council' in 1992 when Russian Sámi joined. Both organizations have
navigated the international legal system for decades, mastering foreign
European notions of diplomacy and law to advocate for their own rights
and place within it. For instance, after its founding, the Inuit
Circumpolar Council sought and obtained consultative status in the UN,
and it has actively participated in UN processes since.

The Saami Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council have played pivotal
roles in the decades of negotiations and discussions which led to the
2007 adoption of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(the Declaration).14 For example, in the early 1980s the Inuit
Circumpolar Council's UN delegate was one of five Indigenous
representatives to draft the Declaration of Principles of Indigenous
Rights which included as Principle 1 "All indigenous peoples have the
right of self-determination. By virtue of this right they may freely
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic,
social, religious, and cultural development".15 That is now clearly
reflected in Article 3 of the UN Declaration: "Indigenous peoples have
the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic,
social and cultural development". The Inuit Circumpolar Council also
insisted that the rights contained in the Declaration were recognised as
being inherent to Indigenous Peoples, rather than granted at the
discretion of states.16 The final text was endorsed by all Nordic
states. Although two of the eight Arctic states initially opposed its
adoption (Canada/ US), and Russia abstained from voting, the Declaration
now enjoys near universal support.

There can be little doubt that the adoption of the Declaration was a
landmark moment for the relationship between international law and
Indigenous Peoples. The discussions which led to its acceptance also
contained their own milestones. Over the course of negotiations,
Indigenous Peoples advocated for institutional reform within the UN to
ensure Indigenous Peoples could participate in the international
decisions that affect them. As a result of this advocacy, systemic
change began even before the Declaration text was adopted, and it
continued thereafter. The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, for
instance, was established under the auspices of the United Nations
Economic, Social and Cultural Council (ecosoc) in 2000. The UN Human
Rights Council founded the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples in the same year the Declaration was adopted, while the first UN
Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was appointed in
2001. There are also examples beyond Indigenous-specific mandates, for
example, the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform began
work in 2017 under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change.

The first World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, was held at UN
Headquarters in New York in September 2014 as a high-level plenary
meeting of the UN General Assembly. Arctic Indigenous Peoples hosted a
global Indigenous Peoples' preparatory meeting in Alta, Sápmi (Norway)
in June 2013. The Alta Outcome Document was instrumental in the
discussions in New York and referred to in the General Assembly
resolution that followed.17 While the World Conference on Indigenous
Peoples signalled a renewed willingness by UN member states to respect,
promote, and advance indigenous rights, it was also, like the
Declaration itself, a political rather than legal commitment and
undertook discussions in a forum in which Indigenous Peoples themselves
were not, strictly speaking, party. Indeed, as much was acknowledged in
the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples' outcome resolution itself,
which recognised the lack of full and effective participation of
Indigenous Peoples within the UN in decisions which affect them (a
matter addressed in the next section of this article).18

Today, [Arctic Indigenous Peoples are active participants in various
fora of international law-making and implementation]{.underline}. The
Inuit Circumpolar Council, for instance, contributes substantively to
the Conference of the Parties to the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries
Agreement negotiations, and holds distinct status in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ipcc), and provisionally the
International Maritime Organization. Both Inuit Circumpolar Council and
the Saami Council are UN accredited ngo s. The Sámi Parliamentary
Council, representing the Sámi Parliaments of Norway, Sweden, and
Finland, are actively involved in the UN as part of the respective
states' delegations. Arctic Indigenous Peoples also influence regional
legal arrangements. The Saami Council, for example, has been consciously
engaged within the EU at least since 1992 with a dedicated an EU Unit
since 2019),19 and the Inuit Circumpolar Council has initiated processes
to establish Inuit-led marine governance regimes between Greenland and
Canada in the North Water Polynya.20

3 One Step Forward, Two Steps Backwards? Ongoing Challenges for Arctic
Indigenous Peoples

In some respects, the overarching goals of the 1973 Arctic Peoples'
Conference have been achieved: most Arctic Indigenous Peoples are now
recognised as Peoples under domestic and international law, and they
have co-founded the Arctic Council, a circumpolar body in which
Indigenous Peoples are permanent participants alongside states.21 Yet
other important aspects of the 1973 resolutions continue to languish.
The full implementation of fundamental rights and equity for Arctic
Indigenous Peoples is yet to materialise, as standards and recognition
differ substantively from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.22 In the face of
new and ongoing colonialities, which this section will elaborate, the
following passage from the Outcome Document reads as relevantly today as
it did in 1973: "we request the obvious: that the government of each
state from which we come recognize our rights as peoples entitled to the
dignity of self-fulfilment and realization ... \[and\] ... there must
not be any displacement or interference with our rights by government
and/or industry, nor can there be disturbance of our lands."23

Despite advances, [[international law]{.mark} continues to
[exclude]{.mark} [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} in both direct and indirect
ways]{.underline}. The [participation]{.underline} of [Arctic Indigenous
Peoples' Organizations]{.underline} and other representatives of
Indigenous Peoples in international fora [must be lobbied]{.underline}
for each time, including for renewal. Indigenous Peoples have long
sought improved participation within the UN system pursuant to
Indigenous Peoples' rights to self-determination,24 to autonomy,25 and
to participate in decisions which affect their rights.26 Through
numerous reports, institutional efforts, and coordinated
campaigning,27 including the specific efforts of Arctic Indigenous
Peoples,28 Indigenous Peoples seek recognition of UN accreditation
status distinct from that afforded to ngo s or other non-state entities.
[This would mean that Indigenous Peoples' [own representative
institutions]{.mark} such as parliaments, governments assemblies, or
traditional councils, would have at minimum]{.underline}, "[permanent
observer status]{.underline} within the UN system", to
[[facilitate]{.mark} their direct rather than indirect
[participation]{.mark} in international negotiations.29]{.underline}

A distinct UN status would afford participation in all meetings of the
UN on matters that affect them, whether or not specifically dealing with
Indigenous Peoples' rights. Such arrangements would also encompass
practical matters such as speaking time within UN fora and allocation on
speakers lists, inclusion within informal consultations on draft
resolutions, and the chance to speak on country visit reports. To this
end, in 2020, Indigenous Peoples established an Indigenous Coordinating
Body for Enhanced Participation in the UN, made up of two members from
each of the seven Indigenous regions recognised by the UN.30 There have
been positive musings from the UN General Assembly on enhancing the
participation of Indigenous Peoples,31 including in the 2014 World
Conference on Indigenous Peoples outcome document,32 resulting in
proposals for reform related to participation venues, modalities of
participation, accreditation criteria and the establishment of a body to
undertake accreditation within the UN Human Rights Council.

Some of the challenges that persist arise in part from an apparent and
concerning broader confusion about what constitutes an Indigenous People
and the rights to which they are entitled. For example, instruments and
forums of international law continue to conflate "local communities"
with "Indigenous Peoples" by running them together without
differentiation.33 The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues has
described this as an "alarming trend in the behaviour of States to
devalue indigenous peoples' status, rights and participation".34 Unlike
local communities, Indigenous Peoples enjoy specific rights and status
under international law. Indigenous Peoples share a collective identity
steeped in centuries of history, culture, science, ways of living, and
knowing, and have suffered historic injustices including colonisation
and various forms of dispossession. In fact, Indigenous Peoples and
local communities have often been pitted against each other, for
instance where human rights specific to Indigenous Peoples come into
conflict with private property rights.35 The phrase "local communities"
is not a term of legal art and does not take into account the Indigenous
Peoples who have been dispossessed of their land as a result of the
colonial encounter.36 Nor can a "local" perspective adequately encompass
the views of Peoples who exist across a vast territory, which is the
case for Inuit and Sámi.

[[Indigenous Territories]{.underline}]{.mark} Are Climate Strongholds

These territories [[are the Amazon's best defense against
destruction]{.mark}. Forests in Indigenous areas have
[deforestation]{.mark} rates that are [2--3 times lower]{.mark} than in
non-Indigenous lands [and store significant]{.mark}ly more
[carbon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This [success comes from t]{.mark}raditional
[k]{.mark}nowledge: agroforestry techniques, low-impact hunting and
fishing, controlled burning to prevent wildfires, and constant
surveillance of illegal activity. These practices allow many Indigenous
Peoples and local communities to live in harmony with the
forest]{.underline} --- not exploit it. Their lands are also rich
in biodiversity, with Indigenous-managed forests hosting more rare
animal species (like bats and amphibia) than any other parts of the
Amazon. They are the protectors of more than 80% of the world's
remaining biodiversity, revealing the vital role Indigenous Peoples and
local communities can play in conserving the Amazon. [[But to
continue]{.mark} this work, [they need secure land rights]{.mark} ---
legal recognition that the land is theirs to live on, care for, and
defend.]{.underline}

What Are Indigenous Land Rights --- and Why Does Demarcation Matter?

Imagine living on a piece of land your ancestors have protected for
centuries --- where every tree, river, and animal holds a story passed
down through generations. Now imagine someone coming in, claiming it's
not yours, and tearing it apart without your say. That's the reality
many Indigenous communities across the Amazon face. 

Although they've been stewards of these forests for generations, their
rights to the land aren\'t always formally recognized. That's
where Indigenous land rights come in. These [rights ensure that
communities can legally own and protect the land they've always lived
on.]{.underline}

[[Demarcation is how those]{.mark} rights [become real]{.mark}. It
[means]{.mark} drawing [clear, legal boundaries]{.mark} around
Indigenous territories on a map --- officially recognizing them [in
the]{.mark} eyes of [the law. When land is demarcated,]{.mark}
[Indigenous Peoples can better defend it]{.mark} against deforestation,
mining, and other threats.]{.underline}

What Threatens Indigenous Land Rights Today?

Despite their conservation leadership, [[Indigenous Peoples face
mounting threats]{.mark}. Illegal logging, gold mining, land grabs
for soy and cattle production, and oil drilling are all threats to their
territories. Often, these [actions are violent and
unchecked]{.mark}.]{.underline}\
\
Political forces also pose danger. In Brazil, former president Jair
Bolsonaro weakened environmental protections and froze land demarcation
processes. While President Lula da Silva has made strides in reversing
some of the damage, controversial proposals like the Marco
Temporal(which argues that Indigenous groups can only assert land rights
if they were occupying the territory in 1988 --- the year where Brazil's
current Constitution was signed) continue to threaten those rights.

The result? Communities are displaced, leaders are assassinated, and
forests once teeming with life are razed. Globally, about 2,106 land
defenders were killed for protecting their territories in between 2012
and 2023 alone, with the majority of deaths being recorded in South
America.\
\
Why isn't [[Marco Temporal]{.underline}]{.mark} fair? Just imagine being
forced off your land by violence or government policy --- then, years
later, being told you can't reclaim it because you weren't there on a
specific date in 1988. That's what the thesis demands of Brazil's
Indigenous Peoples.

It [sets an arbitrary deadline that ignores centuries of displacement,
[mak]{.mark}ing [it nearly impossible for many communities to
prove]{.mark} their rightful [connection to]{.mark} ancestral
[land]{.mark}. Now that it's been enforced, hard-won land rights in the
Amazon are under threat. This law opens the door to further
deforestation, mining, and agribusiness, [endangering]{.mark} both
[Indigenous communities]{.mark} and the planet]{.underline}. [The
[only]{.mark} remaining [way to challenge it is]{.mark} by [joining
together as global citizens]{.mark}]{.underline} and demanding that the
Supreme Court definitively suspend it.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The Fight for Recognition and Protection Despite these challenges,
Indigenous Peoples continue to fight for their land --- and for the
planet. In September 2023, Brazil\'s Supreme Court delivered a landmark
decision rejecting the Marco Temporal thesis. The Court ruled that the
1988 cutoff date was unconstitutional, and affirmed that Indigenous
communities have rights to their ancestral lands regardless of their
physical presence on that specific date. This decision was celebrated by
Indigenous groups and human rights organizations as a significant
victory for Indigenous rights and environmental protection --- but
legislators have since introduced bills to circumvent it. In early 2025,
Justice Gilmar Mendes, a Minister of Brazil's Supreme Federal Court,
proposed a new law that would allow projects like mining and
construction to move forward on Indigenous lands --- without needing
permission from the communities living there. This sparked outrage from
Indigenous leaders and human rights groups, who said it was unfair and
went against Brazil's Constitution. Although Mendes later directed the
removal of the proposal to permit mining from the commission\'s
discussions, Indigenous representatives --- including Maurício Terena
from APIB --- expressed concern that this was not a definitive victory
but a possible tactic to wear down opposition, fearing the issue could
return. Still, the fight continues. Groups like COIAB and APIB are
pushing back, building strong national and international alliances.
Dinaman Tuxa, APIB Coordinator, stated, "COP30 will be a unique moment,
because we will be able to project our messages onto the international
stage. Having Law 14,701 \[the Marco Temporal law\] in force in a COP
year --- when it only fuels conflicts --- is not good for Brazil." He
added, "We want the government to commit to a demarcation policy and to
confront these issues more decisively in defense of Indigenous peoples'
rights."

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

And there are victories too --- after 37 years of legal struggle, the
Guarani Mbya people in São Paulo finally won recognition of part of
their ancestral land --- a reminder that [persistence and tireless
advocacy can deliver justice.]{.underline}

Why This Matters to Everyone

[The [Amazon absorbs]{.mark} up to [2 billion tons of
CO₂ annually]{.mark} --- about 5% of global emissions]{.underline}. But
[[when Indigenous land is taken]{.mark}, deforestation accelerates ---
and [carbon storage collapses]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Losing the Amazon would [release massive]{.mark} amounts of [greenhouse
gases]{.mark}, trigger [feedback loops]{.mark}, [disrupt rainfall
patterns]{.mark} across continents, [and jeopardize global food
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [consequences extend far beyond South
America.]{.underline}

[[Biod]{.underline}]{.mark}iversity [[is]{.mark} also [at
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Amazon is home to 1 in 10 known
species on Earth, many of which exist nowhere else. [[Destroying]{.mark}
these [ecosystems risks losing cures for diseases and]{.mark} vital
[ecological balance]{.mark}]{.underline}.\
The Amazon is a global treasure. But [without the Indigenous Peoples and
local communities who have protected it for millennia, it will not
survive]{.underline}. The fight for Indigenous land rights is not just
about justice --- it\'s about the fate of Indigenous Peoples and the
rest of the planet.

[Human security issues are especially significant for the
[Arctic]{.mark}, [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} since they are
[disproportionately vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because
they, traditionally, rely on the pristine, Arctic, natural environment
for their livelihoods, and [their ethnic, cultural identity is linked to
the unique Arctic ecosystems]{.underline} \[8\]. They become
[increasingly vulnerable [as human activities]{.mark} on their lands
[escalate]{.mark},]{.underline} impacting traditional livelihood
activities while offering an imbalance in benefit sharing due to the
engagement of multiple-interest groups. [As a result, social, economic,
and environmental conditions that define human security]{.underline}
\[9\] and [provide conditions for the enjoyment of [human
rights]{.mark}, contributing to the promotion of social justice and
non-discrimination]{.underline}, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} located
[[at]{.mark} the [centre of tensions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore,
[accommodating these various groups of peoples in the Arctic in their
partnership]{.underline} relationship, via Indigenous peoples'
organisations, [[with national governments]{.mark} and with
international forums, such as the Arctic Council]{.underline}, [allows
the sharing of decision making while observing rights and duties,
which]{.underline} may [[enable]{.mark} an inclusive and a broader
"[democratisation]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[10\]. In other words, these
groups of people are [considered to be the object and the authors of
their developments]{.underline}. They participate in managing the
environment, biodiversity, and natural resources [[and]{.mark} improving
the quality of life and well-being of local communities]{.underline}.
Practices such as these [offer a safeguard for an equal society in
partnership with actors]{.underline} at multiple levels. Furthermore,
[human security [provides a tool]{.mark} with which the right [to
self-determination]{.mark} can be exercised in this
endeavour]{.underline}. The [exercise of the [right to
self-determination]{.mark} eventually reinforces the meeting of the
SDGs]{.underline} as it [[brings Indigenous peoples]{.mark} [onboard
with]{.mark} their [implementation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the Russian Arctic, the [[cooperation]{.mark} among the Indigenous
communities [strengthens their collaborative]{.mark} [efforts to set
agendas]{.mark} that enhance their unitedness [around solving human
security issues]{.mark} and offer a more uniform approach to raising
them]{.underline}. The [unity of Indigenous communities is
vital]{.underline} [for sharing]{.underline} identical [views and
voices]{.underline} coherently while interacting [with other
actors---regional and federal governments]{.underline}, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs: Indigenous communities and Indigenous
associations), corporations, [scientific institutions, and
others]{.underline}. Nowadays, Indigenous communities form transnational
organisations across borders to promote broader collaboration. Their
uniform voices are driven by the unique concerns that affect their
socio-cultural, economic, and environmental integrity, regardless of
territorial divides. Moreover, they participate in norm building at the
international level, directly acting as participants in various global
processes and through their national governments. [The need for such
collaboration is exceptionally high for the]{.underline} 19
[[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} small-numbered [[peoples in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} Russian [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} (Nenets, Saami,
Selkups, Khanty, etc.), who are some of the [most vulnerable
groups]{.underline} in the COVID-19 times \[11\], [[seeking]{.mark} the
[opportunities to maintain]{.mark} their [cultural identity]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} social security to achieve [sustainable
development]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Prioritizing [indigenous knowledge]{.underline} crucial to tribal sovereignty and self determination

**Brewer 20** \[9/1/20, Joseph P. Brewer works with Indigenous peoples
on initiatives, "An Expression of Self-Determination: Incorporating
Alaska Native Knowledge into Community-Driven Energy Sovereignty,"
https://escholarship.org/content/qt3g88z4d6/qt3g88z4d6.pdf\]MZ

Alaska Native peoples have a varied and complicated history with energy
sovereignty, one that makes it difficult to generalize the region's
progress toward that goal. In Fort Yukon, the [Alaska Native-owned and
-operated village corporation of Gwichyaa Zhee has been moving away from
a reliance on fossil]{.underline} fuels by creating a wood-to-energy
project that employs community members in harvesting biomass, that is,
timber. This article presents a case study that examines the
decision-making process of the Gwichyaa Zhee Corporation's
wood-to-energy project as a form of Indigenous knowledge that is
inextricably tied to the actions of self-determination. The project's
reliance upon abundant traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) has proved
essential in ensuring its success.

As TEK continuously evolves as a field, studying examples of this kind
can provide deep insights into productive cross-cultural collaborations.
This case study has implications, [especially for those who seek to work
for or with tribal nations, tribal consortia, and the like]{.underline}.
For in addition to the idea of making local observations or being
rigorous in one's application of knowledge, [Alaska [Natives]{.mark}
seem to be [demonstrating]{.mark} that [community knowledge]{.mark}, and
knowing how to access that knowledge, plays [a crucial role in tribal
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, scholars have argued that TEK
is an essential component of Indigenous ways of knowing and doing that
is also crucial to developing Indigenous sovereignty. [That is, if
[Indigenous peoples]{.mark} are to create food and energy security, it
is [important to make decisions]{.mark} that [center community
well-being]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this sense---[reliance on the entire
community in order to move toward a common goal of
sovereignty---[self-determination is an active component]{.mark} of
TEK]{.underline}. The [Indigenous knowledge]{.underline} used in the
Gwichyaa Zhee Corporation's wood-to-energy project is local in that it
is [directly connected to important self-determination ethics of
community building and knowledge transfer]{.underline}, and also because
as a result of teamwork, [it helps strengthen the fabric of
society]{.underline}. In this sense, [[prioritizing and encouraging
Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} is not only [essential in planning
and]{.mark} implementing this kind of community based project, but is
paramount [to self-determination.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Absent self-determination, indigenous populations risk [extinction]{.underline}

**Castillo 21** \[2/21, Beatriz Huertas Castillo is a Peruvian
anthropologist, "RESPECT FOR THE SELF-DETERMINATION AND PROTECTION OF
THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN ISOLATION," iwgia,

It is necessary for the State and civil society, especially the academic
sector, to [adopt respectful policies and practices toward the way of
life and the fundamental rights of indigenous peoples in
isolation]{.underline}. This means [guaranteeing the exercise of their
[right to self-determination]{.mark}, [providing legal security]{.mark}
and [efficient protection]{.mark} for their territories and [prohibiting
the concession of rights]{.mark} within these territories to external
agents.]{.underline} Simultaneously, it is necessary to implement
strategies for epidemiological prevention and, in the cases in which
there are tensions between peoples in isolation and neighboring
populations, prevent these conflicts. These are some of the basic
conditions to guarantee the physical and sociocultural survival of
peoples in isolation, as well as the peaceful coexistence with the
surrounding communities.

In more concrete terms, political will, specialized personnel, logistics
and a budget are needed to strengthen the protection of these peoples'
territories, implementing surveillance systems in order to identify and
eradicate menaces. [It is [necessary to listen closely]{.mark} to the
population that shares territories with peoples in isolation, which is
mainly indigenous, [with the purpose of identifying potential conflicts
and]{.mark} adopting adequate measures to [prevent
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. The tensions can be a result of either
conflicts and schisms within the group in isolation, interethnic
conflicts with the neighboring communities or external pressure.
[Intersectoral [coordination and collaborating]{.mark} with the local
population to [prevent conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} and deal with
health emergencies caused by the potential spread of diseases seems to
be one of the State's biggest challenges.

When facing risky situations that involve direct interaction with
peoples in isolation, it is necessary to dismiss the possibility of
manipulating said interaction in favor of academic, religious, economic
or political interests; the integrity and the fundamental rights of
these peoples must be guaranteed. The institutions involved in this
process, such as academic ones, should establish codes of ethics and
mechanisms to ensure that their practices do not promote or accelerate
processes of direct and sustained interaction with these peoples.

If there is a case in which an indigenous people in isolation
voluntarily seeks to increase the degree of interaction with their
surroundings, [the State must be prepared to guarantee that the
necessary sanitary conditions, personal and collective integrity,
territorial needs, food sources and time are provided]{.underline}, so
that the population develops physical (immunological), psychological and
sociocultural mechanisms to adapt to the changes and new situations they
will face. [Overall, attention should be directed to generating
conditions that allow increased interaction with the surrounding
population, [preventing the negative effects that have historically put
indigenous peoples under]{.mark} the [risk of
extinction.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Tenure-secure indigenous forestlands exhibit]{.underline}]{.mark} low
[[deforestation]{.mark} rates]{.underline}. The annual deforestation
rates in the tenure-secure indigenous forestlands are [[significantly
lower than]{.mark} on [other lands in]{.mark} the three research
countries of [Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia]{.mark}, [suggesting]{.mark}
that securing indigenous forestland [tenure contributed to reducing
deforestation]{.mark} in these areas]{.underline} between 2000 and 2012.

▪ In Bolivia, the 12-year average observed actual deforestation rate
inside tenure-secure indigenous forestlands was 0.15 percent, while the
12-year average estimated deforestation rate outside indigenous
forestlands was 0.43 percent.

▪ In Brazil, the deforestation rate inside tenure-secure indigenous
forestlands was 0.06 percent, while the deforestation rate outside
indigenous forestlands was 0.15 percent.

▪ In Colombia, the deforestation rate inside tenure secure indigenous
forestlands was 0.04 percent, while the deforestation rate outside
indigenous forestlands was 0.08 percent.

The [benefit-cost [analysis yields two]{.mark} principal
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}:

1\. [Securing indigenous forestland [tenure is a low-cost, high-benefit
investment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

▪ Tenure-secure indigenous forestlands [provide significant global
carbon benefits in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia, [amounting to]{.mark}
a total of US\$[25--34 billion over the next 20
years]{.mark}]{.underline} in net present value through the avoided
annual release of an estimated 42.8--59.7 Mt CO2 emissions. [This is
[equivalent to taking]{.mark} between [9 and 12.6 million passenger
vehicles off the roads]{.mark} for one year.]{.underline}

▪ [Tenure-secure indigenous forestlands provide significant local and
regional ecosystem-service benefits, including [regulat]{.mark}ion of
local [climate dynamics and water cycling]{.mark}, hydrological
services, pollination, nutrient retention, existence values, [and
recreation and tourism values]{.mark}]{.underline}. These benefits are
estimated to range between \$679 and 1,530 billion (or
\$4,559--10,274/ha) for the next 20 years, calculated in net present
value resulting from indigenous forestland tenure-security investment.

▪ [Tenure-secure indigenous forestlands provide low-cost forest
conservation investments for governments]{.underline}. Investments in
tenure security are estimated at \$45 per hectare (ha) in Bolivia,
\$68/ha in Brazil, and \$6/ha in Colombia---the calculated sum of
discounted total costs for a 20-year period. This amounts to at most 1
percent of the total benefits derived from tenure-secure indigenous
forestlands in the three countries. [Comparing the total benefits with
the costs, securing indigenous forestland [tenure]{.mark} can
[generate]{.mark} a positive [net]{.mark} per-hectare [benefit for all
three countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2\. [Securing indigenous forestlands [tenure has significant potential
for cost-effective carbon mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}. From a
financial perspective, [investing in securing indigenous forestland
tenure is a relatively cost-effective measure for climate change
mitigation when compared with other carbon capture and storage
measures]{.underline}. The estimated costs of carbon mitigation through
indigenous forestland tenure-security programs in Bolivia, Brazil, and
Colombia range from \$2.04--3.66/tCO2 , \$8.74--11.88/ tCO2 , and
\$4.75--7.26/tCO2 , respectively. These [costs are significantly [lower
than]{.mark} the average costs of avoided CO2 through [fossil carbon
capture and storage]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are estimated to be
about \$58/tCO2 for coal-fired power plants (5 to 29 times more
expensive than securing indigenous forestland tenure) and \$85/tCO2 for
natural gas-fired power plants (7 to 42 times more expensive).

[These findings [present a strong economic case]{.mark} for governments,
climate change funding agencies, civil society organizations, and other
parties [to invest in]{.mark} securing [indigenous]{.mark} forestland
[tenure]{.mark} in Latin America]{.underline}. While significant
progress has been made in some Amazon basin countries over the last
10--30 years toward formally recognizing community lands, more efforts
are needed to secure the community lands that are not documented or
protected by government. These [[efforts include the need
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the following:

1\. [Secure [community land rights]{.mark}]{.underline}. Governments and
their partners should consider reforming their laws and taking other
actions to strengthen community land rights. For instance, the laws in
Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia recognize indigenous land rights, but do
not provide Indigenous Peoples with sufficient legal protections.
Statutory laws that do not adequately protect community land rights
should be reformed or replaced by supportive legislation. For Indigenous
Peoples and communities to realize their rights, laws that support their
lands must also be implemented and enforced. [Despite some progress in
securing land rights in Bolivia, Brazil, and Colombia, considerable
areas of indigenous lands are not mapped, demarcated, or formally
registered]{.underline}. Governments should remove administrative
hurdles and provide responsible agencies with the human and financial
resources needed to document and protect all indigenous and community
lands in their country.

吳

According to one study, [15% of global CO2 emissions are attributed to
deforestation]{.underline}.77 However, [the [Amazon's]{.mark} role in
the global management of climate and CO2 levels is larger than
that]{.underline}; [[deforestation]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Amazon
[[leads]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark} carbon [emissions during]{.mark}
the [logging]{.mark} process, [but also from fires]{.mark}]{.underline}
caused by deforestation. The [massive tree loss]{.underline} brought
about by deforestation [has also led to a [decreas]{.mark}ing level of
[CO2 absorption]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Amazon.

Researchers say that [the Amazon]{.underline}, which once used to be a
massive carbon sink, [may only be absorbing half as much carbon dioxide
as it did 20 years ago, mostly due to
deforestation]{.underline}.78 Furthermore, one study in 2019 found that
current prediction models for the Amazon's CO2 absorption, and their
accompanying assumptions, did not take into consideration the depleted
phosphorus levels in the Amazon's soil, which impacts a tree's ability
to take in CO2.79 As a result, the study revealed that these predictions
for absorption were inaccurate, as they were double the amount of
absorption actually taking place.80 In other words, [[this]{.mark} data
[is]{.mark} especially [relevant to global climate change as]{.mark} the
[Amazon absorbs a quarter]{.mark} of the carbon dioxide absorbed [by all
rainforests globally]{.mark}]{.underline}---[a number which decreases
with the rise of deforestation]{.underline}.81 Annually, the world as a
whole emits 40 billion tons of CO2 into the air, 2 billion tons of which
is absorbed by the Amazon rainforest.82

Deforestation's contribution to climate change and carbon emission
becomes cyclical when fire becomes involved. Slash-and-burn techniques
use fire to clear forest, which emits additional CO2 into the
atmosphere, along with the initial CO2 emissions that come with
deforestation. Subsequently, [[stopping deforestation is]{.mark} widely
[recognized as one of the most effective fronts]{.mark} on which [to
battle climate change]{.mark}, as the [opposite effect on]{.mark} carbon
[emissions can be seen with reductions in
deforestation]{.mark}]{.underline}.83

The [significant [loss of vegetation]{.mark}]{.underline} from
deforestation in the Amazon, [[and]{.mark} therefore [transpiration of
water]{.mark} that comes from that vegetation, [negatively affects water
cycles and triggers]{.mark} a cycle of [desertification]{.mark} and
climate change]{.underline} not only in the region, but also [[around
the world]{.underline}]{.mark}.84 Locally, transpiration and evaporation
accounts for 50-60% of rainfall in the region of Amazonia, and shifts in
such a large portion of the water cycle have consequences across the
globe.85

For example, in 2014, [Princeton University-led researchers reported
that widespread destruction of the Amazon rainforest could result in 20%
less rain in the northwest United States, and 50% less snowpack in the
Sierra Nevada]{.underline}. They also framed the implications of these
effects, noting that the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains is an
important source of water for irrigation in California's Central Valley,
and that California has been the United States' primary state for food
and dairy production for the past 50 years.86

Another study showed that [the [effect of deforestation in the Amazon
was strong on water cycles around the world]{.mark}]{.underline},

the Americas, and of greatest note in the central United States.87 Some

But it is also true that [hunger and [food insecurity]{.mark} can [lead
to instability. There is a vicious feedback loop]{.mark} between
conflict and hunger currently [at play in dozens of countries]{.mark}
around the world. [War drives hunger and hunger drives
war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 2017, the World Food Program USA (WFP USA) produced a report
titled Winning the Peace: Hunger and Instability. It was a comprehensive
review of the literature on "food-related instability"---or the ways
that hunger drives conflict. At the time, U.S. lawmakers knew
anecdotally that this relationship existed. Former Senate Agriculture
Committee chair Pat Roberts (D-KS) said in a 2015 speech, "Show me a
nation that cannot feed itself, and I'll show you a nation in chaos."
Others, like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), frequently warned that
providing humanitarian assistance in some of the world's most complex
emergencies was necessary to avoid more costly---in both blood and
treasure---engagements.

Winning the Peace provided a snapshot of what the academic community
knew about the relationship between food insecurity and
conflict. [[With]{.mark} Russia's invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in February of 2022, the
[lingering]{.underline} economic [impacts of the
[Covid]{.mark}]{.underline}-19 pandemic, [[and]{.mark} a rise in extreme
[climate]{.mark} events]{.underline} around the world, [[2022
was]{.mark} a year of [unprecedented global hunger]{.mark}. Predictably,
[global instability rose in tandem]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least 12,500
protests occurred last year in countries facing rapid food and fuel
price increases.

Academic literature on food-related instability has grown significantly
in the last half decade. In fact, almost 50 percent of all the research
to be published on food-related instability over the past 20 years has
been produced in the last five years alone. A new report by WFP USA,
launched in April of 2023, aims to capture this latest thinking in a
review of [[60 peer-reviewed academic studies]{.underline}]{.mark}
produced between 2017 and 2022. Dangerously Hungry is a study of
studies. This commentary is a literature review of such studies and
discusses specific drivers and motivators of food-related instability,
and how to create an improved framework for understanding of the complex
relationship between food insecurity and conflict.

Drivers of Food-Related Instability

This review [[finds]{.mark} that food-related instability has three main
drivers: climate change, conflict over natural resources, and economic
shocks. ]{.underline}

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Almost half of all studies reviewed in Dangerously Hungry investigate
food-related instability through the lens of climate change:
precipitation change, drought, temperature spikes, desertification, and
other adverse climate events. This trend reflects tremendous growth in
climate security literature in recent years. Many of these studies focus
on food systems, often the first sector to feel the impacts of climate
change. One study from Kyung Hee University in South Korea, for example,
shows that high temperatures during corn growing seasons in sub-Saharan
Africa reduced yields and led to a rise in civil conflict. The author
suggests that with continued warming, civil conflict in the region is
expected to increase by over 30 percent in the coming decade. Meanwhile,
another Harvard University study finds that below-average rainfall can
increase the likelihood of civil war in Africa by as much as 2.3
percent. In Somalia specifically, a country plagued by long-term
droughts, decreases in annual precipitation across the country were
associated with an increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 1991
and 2019. The impact of climate change on food systems is driving
conflict around the world. A second driver of food-related instability
is competition over natural resources. Conflicts between pastoralists
and farmers in the African Sahel are among the most studied examples of
food-related instability in this space. Farmer-herder conflict or
"pastoralist violence" has increased greatly in the last decade in West
and Central Africa, particularly in Nigeria, central Mali and northern
Burkina Faso. This includes cattle raids, communal or ethnic violence
over land and water resources, and conflict driven by association with
violent extremist movements. These trends are exacerbated by
fast-spreading desertification and multi-year droughts across the
African Sahel. According to the African Center for Strategic Studies,
more than 15,000 people have been killed in farmer-herder related
conflicts in the last decade alone. Dangerously Hungry also sheds new
light on the ways that agricultural abundance has also been linked to
violence. For example, in studying the impacts of wheat and corn
production across Africa, Ore Koren of Indiana University suggests that
"contrary to previous expectations, conflict is driven by higher yields,
on average, and not by scarcity." In these situations of abundance,
rebel groups are more likely to use violence to secure access to food
resources. Indeed, he shows that the probability of rebel attacks
increased significantly in areas with high agricultural potential. This
is commonly referred to as "strategic conflict." What the author is
referring to in this case, however, is best considered "relative
abundance"---conflict over pockets of agricultural productivity in
otherwise scarce settings. Finally, food-related instability is driven
by economic shocks. The 2007--2008 global food price crisis led to
social unrest in at least 40 low- and middle-income countries in what
has been termed the "silent tsunami;" it was the subject of significant
attention in the Winning the Peace report. The food price crisis of 2022
bears remarkable similarities to 2008. According to analysis from the
International Food Policy Research Institute, food prices were on the
rise due to "uneven recovery from the COVID-19 crisis from surges in
global demand and supply disruptions from transport and logistics." This
confluence of stressors resulted in a global market that was unprepared
for the wheat, maize, oilseed, fuel, and fertilizer supply disruptions
caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By the summer of 2022, more than
20 countries were facing protests and riots related, at least in part,
to high food prices. Peer-reviewed research on the 2022 global food
price crisis is still forthcoming, but several authors have already
estimated the downstream effects it has had, and will continue to have,
on conflict. Tufts University economist Eoin McGuirk and deputy director
of Stanford's Center on Food Security and the Environment, Marshall
Burke, for example, have studied the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine
on producer and consumer price indexes, and the effect of these indexes
on violence in Africa. They estimate that "the weighted average effect
of the Russian invasion to be an increase in intergroup conflict in
Africa of 5.3%." That is after considering the conflict-reducing effects
of increased prices for farmers across the continent; the economic
impacts in the agricultural sector are, after all, two-sided. It
continues to be the case that, generally, increased food prices lead to
reduced conflict in food-producing areas and increased conflict in food
consuming areas.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Motivators of Food-Related Instability 

[Modern conflicts are almost never driven by a single cause. [Food
insecurity is often]{.mark} referred to as "the straw that breaks the
camel's back" or [a "threat multiplier" in conflict]{.mark}
events]{.underline}. It is true that [food insecurity]{.underline} alone
is often not enough to produce conflict; it [must]{.underline} also [be
met with external motivators that cause people to resort to
violence]{.underline}, and is strongly determined by the underlying
social, political, and economic context. Those motivators can be
captured in three interrelated concepts: desperation, grievance, and
governance.

Often, the strongest motivator for participation in conflict is
economics. This is sometimes referred to as the opportunity cost thesis,
which states that when incomes are low and expected returns from
fighting outweigh the benefits of traditional economic activity, one's
motivation to join a militia or rebellion increases. Researchers refer
to this motivator as greed, a reference to the material benefits---even
extreme wealth---often anticipated by groups staging rebellion. In the
case of recruitment of food insecure populations to extremist movements,
though, it is not one's desire for wealth but one's inability to meet
their basic needs that is exploited. This is not greed, but
desperation. 

In interviews with former al Shabaab fighters in Somalia, socioeconomic
conditions were the most common motivator for joining. The authors of
that study, Anneli Botha and Mahdi Abdile, spoke to one fighter who
explained that he and his friends were lured with promises of a mobile
phone and \$50 a month upon joining. Other terrorist organizations have
employed similar recruitment tactics. The Islamic State, for example,
offered refugees food and cash payments of up to \$1,000 to join, and
Boko Haram has been shown to provide meals and loans to prospective
recruits. In many settings, [violent [extremist organizations
are]{.mark} also [known to capture]{.mark} the means of food production
or [agricultural resources]{.mark} in order [to fuel their
rebellion]{.mark}. Food insecurity can raise the cost of mounting an
insurgency, leading to the victimization of people who produce and hold
food]{.underline}. Violence against civilians, in other words, can be a
resource mobilization strategy.

The second category of motivation is grievance. One major criticism of
the opportunity cost framework (i.e., individual greed or desperation)
is its inattention to the collective action required for widespread
rebellion. Although it is true that individuals are motivated to engage
in violence due to unemployment, wage losses, and rising costs of living
(including food costs), collective agency---or a force that brings
people together---is also required for higher levels of violence. [[Food
price riots]{.mark} are a good example of this grievance-based
phenomenon, with high food prices]{.underline} (especially for foods of
cultural importance) [[fuel]{.mark}ing [frustration and mistrust]{.mark}
that cuts across class and ethnic groups]{.underline}. Grievance, of
course, can also be divisive. In grievance-motived instability involving
food, food insecurity is often the straw that breaks the camel's back
and [[causes societies to cleave along preestablished lines]{.mark} over
perceived or real inequalities or discrimination.]{.underline}

Finally, food-related instability is made more likely through poor
governance. The [[inability of]{.mark} a [government to ensure an
adequate food supply]{.mark} for its people can [lead to questions
over]{.mark} a government's [legitimacy]{.mark} and ability to fulfill
its people's most basic needs]{.underline}. In a 2017 report by the UN
Development Program, the authors note that 71 percent of voluntary
recruits (to [[extremist groups]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[identified
gov]{.mark}ernment [action as the final trigger]{.mark} that motivated
them to join the organization]{.underline}. Limited government capacity
to provide services or policing can create a "vacuum effect," which is a
dynamic that [provides an [open]{.mark}ing for [rebel]{.mark} groups to
offer an [alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}uggest that they themselves could provide those
basic services to people.

Conclusion

[Modern conflicts are not confined by political borders, and [hunger
emergencies must be addressed before they metastasize into large-scale
security threats]{.mark}. U.S. lawmakers and officials are also becoming
more cognizant of the fact that food insecurity is of consequence to
national security]{.underline}. In October 2022, the Biden
administration released its U.S. National Security Strategy. At the time
of its writing, the world had reached record levels of food
insecurity---349 million people across 79 countries faced crisis levels
of hunger and almost one million people in Somalia, Afghanistan,
Ethiopia, Haiti, South Sudan and Yemen were experiencing famine-like
conditions. The 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy cited food on 30
occasions, more than double the highest-ever number of references in a
strategy document and more than 10 times the number of references than
the previous strategy. In late 2022 the U.S. Senate and Congress passed
resolutions---S.Res.669 and H.Res.922---condemning the use of food as a
weapon of war and bringing new resources to bear on the problem of
food-related instability.

## International Law

### I-Law Net-Benefit\-\--Shell 

#### [Consultation in the Arctic revitalizes international law by resolving contradictions. Thumpers don't assume to magnitude of the internal link.]{.underline}

and International Law"

[Even aspects of [international law designed]{.mark} to [protect]{.mark}
the rights of [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} can have the paradoxical
[consequence]{.mark}]{.underline} of [[facilitating]{.mark} greater
[exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, that states have an
[[obligation]{.mark} to obtain Indigenous Peoples' free, [prior and
informed consent]{.mark} in decisions which affect them is [not]{.mark}
fully [implemented]{.mark}]{.underline} in Greenland. The governments of
both Greenland and Denmark agree that for the purposes of ensuring
adherence to the principle of obtaining Indigenous Peoples free, prior
and informed consent, the consent of the Greenlandic Government alone is
sufficient.37 This [interpretation is not in keeping with obligations
under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples or
Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent
Countries, nor the broader suite of human rights obligations under both
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (iccpr) and
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights]{.underline} (icescr).

The [consultation and participation of Indigenous Peoples in
decisions]{.underline} [which affect them is not
satisfied automatically merely because the Government is made up of
people who identify as Inuit.38 Such an interpretation undermines the
purpose of the principle which]{.underline} is to [prevent harm to those
affected by the relevant decision]{.underline}, and compromises the idea
that Indigenous Peoples "engage in decision-making processes through
representatives chosen by themselves and in accordance with their own
procedures ...".39 Although today the Government of Greenland is elected
by a populace who are predominantly Inuit, that may not always be the
case. Most Danish citizens who have held residence in Greenland for six
months can stand for election and vote. In addition, political leaders
must take into account the interests of a range of other stakeholders,
including their non-indigenous constituents, business interests, other
interest groups, as well as internal stakeholders in exercising
legislative and executive authority.40 That a political executive could
claim to be the exclusive voice of Indigenous Peoples could lead to a
paradoxical result in which the purported implementation of
participatory rights effectively diminishes, rather than advances
them,41 for instance if the demography of Greenland shifts, or the
Government of Greenland prioritises other considerations over Inuit
rights. That is not to say that the Government of Greenland could never
fulfil such a role, rather, it cannot be assumed that it does so as a
matter of default.42

[Arctic [Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples are [experiencing new
encroachments]{.mark} on their rights in the name of environmental
protection]{.underline}, reminiscent of historical dispossessions and
the long-standing misalignment between the interrelated rights of
Indigenous Peoples and the desires of those claiming to safeguard or
represent the interests of nature and the environment. The term "green
colonialism" has been used by Sámi in particular, and was also referred
to in the Joint Statement of the 2023 Arctic Peoples' Conference to
describe "land encroachment, resource extraction, renewable energy
production, and protectionist conservation ... undertaken at the expense
of Indigenous Peoples' reality".43 When pursued in this way, the green
transition reproduces colonial logics and can lead to actual or
effective dispossession of Indigenous Peoples' natural resources,
territory, and culture. Moreover, it infringes the distinct rights held
by Indigenous Peoples including self-determination, free determination
of political, social, economic, and cultural development, and free,
prior, and informed consent in decisions that affect them.44

For example, the Øyfjellet wind energy project in Norway is located in
the middle of an important reindeer migration route and pasture area.
The project first broke ground in April 2020 after a fiercely contested
licensing process.45 The construction and presence of the subsequent
windmills has compromised indigenous knowledge and Sámi capacity to
continue traditional herding practices. Yet some litigious action has
succeeded in halting such developments. In 2021, the Supreme Court of
Norway found that the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy's
decision to grant a license for wind energy infrastructure on the Fosen
Peninsula was a violation of reindeer herders' right to enjoy their own
culture under Article 27 of the iccpr. The decision echoed earlier
concerns of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples that the installation of wind power plants in territory
traditionally used by Sámi could constitute an unlawful limitation of
Sámi rights.46 The court's reasoning stood in contrast to a much earlier
decision of the Norwegian Supreme Court (1982) which upheld a government
decision to build hydroelectricity infrastructure on the Alta River,
construction for which was completed in 1987.47 Thus, while tensions
between Sámi rights and green energy infrastructure projects are not
themselves new, the success of arguments grounded in international law
is a more contemporary development.48

Inuit are also increasingly approached with suggestions for projects
that would fundamentally alter their way of life in the name of the
climate response, although Inuit have not (yet) resorted to litigation
to respond. Scientists rush to engineer mechanisms to slow the melting
of the Greenland ice sheet, but often do so with little or no input from
the Peoples on whose territories the relevant infrastructure will be
placed. Such technologies are often profoundly invasive because they
require large-scale manipulation. The Polar Umbrella for instance, would
utilise massive canopies to cool the surface of the icecap by deflecting
sun and each would be so large as to host helipads and tourist
attractions. Underlying such initiatives is a prevailing and problematic
assumption that the interests of Indigenous Peoples
are inherently aligned with the mechanisms for implementing the green
transition. To be sure, Arctic Indigenous Peoples have long been
supportive of measures to diminish the harms caused by climate change
and to ensure sustainable approaches to natural resource
management.49 However, they will resist initiatives that do so at the
expense of their inherent rights, existence or way of life, or in
contravention of the norms of international law they have long fought to
secure (as the Joint Statement of the 2023 Arctic Peoples' Conference
attests).

While new in its tenacity and clarity, the 2023 Joint Statement also
reflects some longer-held positions of Arctic Indigenous Peoples. In
2010, for example, after years of preparation and revisions, the Inuit
Circumpolar Council issued a single Inuit Arctic Policy, which
prioritised the recognition of the interests of Inuit as a single Arctic
People living across four very different nation-states. The policy is
distinct from those issued by states, which typically view the Arctic as
a site of resource extraction, and potential transit, with the rights
and interests of Arctic Indigenous Peoples routinely ignored, or
mentioned superficially, which is inconsistent with Indigenous Peoples
rights to directly participate in decisions which impact them.

[Climate change continues to constitute an existential
threat]{.underline} to [Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} and their
livelihoods, and unjust green transition and climate mitigation
initiatives [add to existing pressures]{.underline}. This is not aided
by geopolitical developments in and around the Arctic. The Arctic has
been the object of great-power military competition for centuries, and
Arctic Indigenous Peoples have long navigated icy political waters
across state boundaries, not least during the militarization of Inuit
territories during and between the first and second World Wars. A 1977
Inuit Circumpolar Council resolution concerning peaceful and safe uses
of the Arctic Circumpolar Zone exemplifies longstanding Inuit insistence
on maintaining a peaceful region.50 More recent military threats have
triggered renewed recognition of the strategic advantage of the Arctic.
Here too, actions based on real or perceived military imperatives add to
other forms of new colonialism, in which neo-colonial arguments
insistent on "greater good" imperatives, ignore Indigenous Peoples'
knowledge, interests, and sovereignty and, more fundamentally their
rights, under international law entirely.

Traditional [security concerns]{.underline} have also [undermined some
of the advances by Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} in regional
arrangements such as the Arctic Council. Established in 1996, the
purpose of the Arctic Council is to provide a means for promoting
cooperation, coordination and interaction among Arctic states, with the
full participation of Arctic Indigenous Peoples.51 It is made up of
eight member states and six organizations representing Arctic Indigenous
Peoples'. [The Arctic Council is unique because it has always made
decisions based on consensus, which grants its Indigenous participants
significant informal power.]{.underline} Moreover, given the regularly
changing governments within the state apparatus, the [Indigenous
participants make up the Arctic Council's institutional
memory]{.underline}. [When Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline} in 2022,
seven of the eight Arctic states paused the Arctic Council's
proceedings, and there was some concern that the [[Arctic
Council]{.mark} might [no longer function]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
would eschew Arctic Indigenous Peoples' meaningful participation in
regional governance. The [[Inuit]{.mark} Circumpolar [Council]{.mark}
and the [Saami Council]{.mark}]{.underline} each represent peoples on
the Russian side of their homelands too, and are
[[accustomed]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [navigating]{.mark} tense
[East-West cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The situation was partly
resolved in May 2023 when Arctic Council, in accordance with its rules
of procedure, held its biennial meeting and facilitated the transfer of
its chairmanship from Russia to Norway.52 It nevertheless illustrates
the importance of regional arrangements for [Arctic Indigenous
[Peoples']{.mark} inclusion in processes which affect them, their value
when they are included, and at the same time their [continued
susceptibility]{.mark} to the [unilateral decision-making of
states]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although, Nordic states have stood at the forefront of international
advocacy for the rights of Indigenous Peoples in multilateral fora,
their commitment to the implementation of those norms abroad often
contrasts with their implementation of them at home. Arctic Indigenous
Peoples have sought to address the shortcomings in human rights
implementation through their own self-governance arrangements and
associated ngo s. It is challenging work, particularly when undertaken
in the context of a lack of adequate resources, the cultural domination
of settler states, and when it must be performed by people who are
already spread thin across multiple roles and legal systems. For Inuit
and Sámi, regular re-configuration to fit the remit of a state-based
system of international law is both par for the course and immensely
challenging. For instance, in relation to enhanced participation [in the
UN system, Inuit are yet to determine which institution(s) constitute a
representative body for them]{.underline}. Nor do Inuit have a
collaborative parliamentary body across the national territorial
boundaries akin to the Sámi Parliamentary Council, and neither Sámi nor
Inuit can currently engage fully with their Russian counterparts. The
recognition of Indigenous Peoples' interconnected and indivisible rights
have been achieved in the UN Declaration. [However, the nation-state
model of the [existing world order]{.mark} must continue to
[evolve]{.mark} progressively, [in line]{.mark} with [Indigenous]{.mark}
Peoples' direct, full and [effective]{.mark} [participation across the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

4 Conclusion

The [state-based system of [international law]{.mark} is replete with
[examples]{.mark} of its [structured
contradictions]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 [It [forbids]{.mark} the
initiation of [war and]{.mark} also [provides]{.mark} the [rules for its
conduct]{.mark}, [facilitates]{.mark} international industrial [trade
and the exploitation]{.mark} of non-renewable resources, [and]{.mark}
also [purports to limit emissions]{.mark}, and in this case, it provides
rules to uphold Indigenous Peoples' rights while at the same time paying
homage to the wealth and sovereignties constructed at their expense.
[International law underpins]{.mark} the capitalist-[colonial
project,]{.mark} while at the same time [attempting to minimise the
damage]{.mark} of that very endeavour. The international legal system is
comprised of states, but the world is made up of peoples, who live as
nations across, within, and between, state borders.]{.underline}

[[Despite various failures]{.mark} of [international law]{.mark} to
recognise or address centuries of structural violence,
dispossession]{.underline}, and [disenfranchisement]{.underline},
[[Arctic Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples]{.underline} have, through their own
persistence, [mastered and [contributed]{.mark} to the
[development]{.mark} of the Western European]{.underline} [[legal
norms]{.underline}]{.mark} in a system that once [facilitated their
colonisation]{.underline}. The fiftieth anniversary of the Arctic
Peoples' Conference was a moment to reflect on these and other
achievements of Arctic Indigenous Peoples, building upon the 1973
resolutions and addressing contemporary challenges. The 2023 Joint
Statement addresses the need for enhanced engagement in the forums of
international law, intergenerational justice, intersecting rights to
wellbeing, land, water and natural resources, and to address the risks
posed by climate change and colonialism. It reflects on Arctic
Indigenous Peoples' "contributions to various national and international
governing bodies and how our way forward was paved by the people, now
elders, who first came together to envision a better
future."54 [Although Arctic Indigenous Peoples "have survived, and
thrived, through hundreds of years of colonization ... many challenges
and colonial systems remain to be dismantled]{.underline}."55 W[ithin
the forums of international law, Arctic Indigenous Peoples continue to
work to address inequalities in representation and recognition, and to
insist that the [rules-based international legal]{.mark} order
[upholds]{.mark} the [rights, interests, and sovereignties]{.mark} of
those it has systematically excluded.]{.underline}

#### International Law solves [global cooperation]{.underline} and a list of [existential threats]{.underline}. 

Alina **Habba 24**, 2-21-2024, \"The Role of International Law in a
Globalized World\", Medium,
https://alinahabba.medium.com/the-role-of-international-law-in-a-globalized-world-2cf5a89e8292

In today's [[interconnected]{.mark} and rapidly evolving [global
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[importance]{.mark} of
[international law cannot be overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
world becomes increasingly [interconnected through trade, technology,
and communication]{.underline}, the need for a framework of rules and
regulations to govern international relations becomes paramount. In this
article, we will explore the [role of international law in a globalized
world and examine its significance in shaping the behavior of states,
[promoting cooperation]{.mark}, and [addressing global
challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Establishing a [Framework for Cooperation]{.underline}: International
law serves as a framework for cooperation among states, providing a set
of rules and norms that govern their interactions in various domains,
including diplomacy, trade, and security. [By establishing clear
guidelines and standards of behavior, international law helps to prevent
conflicts and disputes between states and promotes peaceful
resolution]{.underline} of disputes through negotiation and diplomacy.

Promoting Peace and Security: One of the primary objectives of
[international law is to [promote peace and security]{.mark} in the
global community]{.underline}. Through instruments such as [treaties,
conventions, and agreements, states [commit]{.mark} to [upholding
principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity]{.mark}, and
[non-aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. International law also
[[regulates]{.mark} the [use of force]{.mark} and provides
mechanisms]{.underline} for [conflict]{.underline} [prevention,
management, and resolution]{.underline}, such as the United Nations
Security Council and international peacekeeping operations.

Facilitating [Economic Development and Trade]{.underline}: International
law plays a crucial role in [[facilitating]{.mark} [economic
development]{.mark}]{.underline} and trade by providing a framework of
[rules and regulations that [govern international
commerce]{.mark}]{.underline}. Treaties and agreements, such as free
trade agreements and investment treaties, establish rights and
obligations for states and create a [predictable and stable environment
for businesses to operate across borders]{.underline}. International law
also addresses issues such as [intellectual property rights, competition
policy, and environmental standards, ensuring fair and equitable
treatment for all parties involved.]{.underline}

Protecting Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: Human rights law is an
essential component of international law, providing a framework for the
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a global scale.
International human rights instruments, such as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, establish universal standards for the protection of
individuals' rights to life, liberty, and security of person, as well as
freedoms of expression, assembly, and religion.

Addressing Transnational Challenges: In an increasingly interconnected
world, transnational challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and
pandemics require coordinated and collective responses from the
international community. International law provides a framework for
addressing these challenges through mechanisms such as multilateral
treaties, conventions, and agreements. By establishing rules and norms
for cooperation and coordination, international law enables states to
work together to tackle shared problems and achieve common goals.

[[Upholding]{.mark} the [Rule of Law]{.mark}]{.underline}: The rule of
law is a [[fundamental principle]{.mark} of [i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, ensuring that states abide by their
legal [obligations and commitments under international law]{.underline}.
International legal institutions, such as the International Court of
Justice and international tribunals, play a crucial role in interpreting
and enforcing international law and holding states accountable for their
actions. By upholding the rule of law, international law promotes
stability, predictability, and fairness in the global community.

Balancing Sovereignty and Global Governance: International law seeks to
strike a balance between state sovereignty and the need for global
governance in addressing common challenges and promoting common
interests. While respecting states' sovereign rights and
responsibilities, international law also recognizes the
interconnectedness of states and the importance of collective action in
addressing global issues. Through mechanisms such as international
organizations, treaties, and conventions, international law provides a
framework for collective decision-making and cooperation among states.

Adapting to Evolving Realities: As the global landscape continues to
evolve, [international law must [adapt]{.mark} to [new realities]{.mark}
and [emerging challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rapid
[advancements]{.mark} in [technology]{.mark}]{.underline}, shifting
geopolitical dynamics, and global crises such as climate change and
pandemics require innovative approaches and flexible mechanisms for
international cooperation. International law must remain responsive and
adaptive to these changes, ensuring its relevance and effectiveness in
addressing contemporary global issues.

In a globalized world characterized by interconnectedness and
interdependence, international law plays a crucial role in shaping the
[behavior of states, promoting cooperation, and addressing global
challenges]{.underline}. By providing a framework for cooperation,
[[promoting peace and security]{.mark}, [facilitating]{.mark} economic
[development]{.mark} and trade, protecting human rights, addressing
transnational challenges]{.underline}, upholding the rule of law,
balancing sovereignty and global governance, and adapting to evolving
realities, international law serves as a cornerstone of the
international system, guiding states' interactions and promoting the
common good of humanity. As the world continues to evolve, the
importance of international law in promoting stability, justice, and
cooperation on a global scale will only continue to grow.

#### International law is [necessary]{.underline} to check [war]{.underline}. 

Stuart Casey-**Maslen 17**, professor on international law, 2017, "The
Role of International Law in Preventing War and Promoting Peace" Chapter
13 in *Preventing War and Promoting Peace*, pp 184.

The [[corollary]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the modern [prohibition of
war]{.mark} is the [peaceful settlement]{.mark} of disputes]{.underline}
(Clapham 2012; UN General Assembly (UNGA) 1970). The first article of
the UN Charter sets out as one of the organization's purposes, "to bring
about by [[peaceful]{.mark} means, and in [conformity]{.mark} with the
[principles of]{.mark} justice and [international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}, adjustment or [settlement of international
disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the
peace]{.underline}" (UN 1945, Art. 1(1)). Accordingly, a principal task
for the [ICJ]{.underline} is to [[resolve disputes]{.mark} between
states peacefully]{.underline} and in accordance with law and [legal
principles]{.underline}, thereby [obviating the need or justification to
have recourse to violent means]{.underline}. So when we speak of the
[international]{.underline} [[rule of law]{.underline}]{.mark}, foremost
in our minds is pacific respect for the law. Of course, ensuring respect
for the law may sometimes require the threat or use of force. The
[simultaneous [globalization]{.mark} and [fragmentation]{.mark}
characterizing contemporary life has been reflected]{.underline}, and
promoted, by [technological developments]{.underline} in weapons and
their influence on warfare (O'Connell 1990). Far from [enhancing
security]{.underline}, this has [provoked fear and heightened
danger]{.underline}. It is now possible to [[carry]{.mark} and
[deploy]{.mark} a [dirty bomb]{.mark}]{.underline} using nuclear
material, or even a [[nuclear weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a
suitcase. A war can be started, and [great suffering
inflicted]{.underline}, by [[cyber warfare]{.mark} initiated from a
computer laptop]{.underline} (Dinstein 2012). And an [unmanned aerial
vehicle]{.underline} will be able to del[iver a deadly [payload]{.mark}
over [great distances]{.mark} by [remote command]{.mark}]{.underline}
from a smart- phone (or even decide to kill people autonomously)
(Chandler 2011). These [[challenges]{.mark} to [international
law]{.mark} go [beyond constraints]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
[traditional phenomenon]{.underline} of war between nations.

The remainder of this chapter is divided into three sections. The first
summarizes historical efforts to prevent war by legal means. The second
describes the [[international legal rules]{.mark} that [govern use of
force]{.mark}]{.underline} by one state against another (known by its
Latin moniker, jus ad bellum). The third section describes certain key
trends in warfare, while a short conclusion highlights actions that
could help to [[reduce the risks of warfare]{.mark} in the
future,]{.underline} suggesting how health professionals can contribute
to this agenda. Historical Efforts to Prevent War under International

### I-Law Net-Benefit\-\--Internal Link 

#### Binding Consultation is the cornerstone of international law. 

Christina **Allard 18**, Luleå University of Technology, Division of
Social Sciences, 02/09/2018, "The Rationale for the Duty to Consult
Indigenous Peoples: Comparative Reflections from Nordic and Canadian
Legal Contexts", Vol 9, *Artic Review*,
https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/729/2317, eb

[[Consultation]{.underline}]{.mark} is an increasingly
[[important]{.mark} aspect of [Indigenous]{.mark} people's
[law]{.mark},]{.underline} including [in the [Arctic]{.mark}
region,]{.underline}1 its purpose [being to [engage]{.mark} in [good
faith]{.mark} and reach unanimity and [understanding]{.mark}. Rules
concerning consultation]{.underline} are designed to [build
dialogue]{.underline}; it is expected that the State and affected
Indigenous people [try to reaching a mutually satisfactory
agreement]{.underline} in earnest. However, there is no specific formula
for consultation that works in all circumstances and across all
jurisdictions, rather, its practice tends to be country specific
notwithstanding international attention on the matter.2 W[ith
[respect]{.mark} to the [procedural side]{.mark} of Indigenous
[rights]{.mark}, [consultation]{.mark} of indigenous groups by a State
can be seen as a [key element]{.mark} in ensuring successful
[melding]{.mark} between [groups]{.mark} in [bi]{.mark}- or
[multi-cultural societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Consultation]{.mark}
and participation are understood to form the [cornerstone]{.mark} of the
[ILO]{.mark} Convention Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in
Independent Countries]{.underline}, 1989 (hereinafter ILO Convention No.
169) and the basis for applying other articles.3 Participatory rights
have also been strongly promoted in the UN Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), 2007, especially the concept of free, prior
and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples.4

Today there are many [[international documents]{.mark} that
[secure]{.mark} [participatory rights for Indigenous]{.mark}
[peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}, among which Articles 6 and 7 of ILO
Convention No. 169, which are [legally binding to its
parties,]{.underline} figure prominently. [Consultations do not,
however, allow for "veto power" over developments]{.underline},5 nor do
they hold any promise that matters pivotal to the Indigenous community
will be accommodated and adopted. It has been argued that consultation
as a procedure is not meant to constitute an effective veto.6

The law, nevertheless, is evolving, both in the international and
domestic spheres. It should be noted that, in line with
[UNDRIP]{.underline}, there is [presently a [shift from consultation to
consent]{.mark} in [international law]{.mark}]{.underline}, an
[issue]{.underline} that will not be addressed here. The basic idea of
FPIC is rather straightforward, but legally it is a contested and
confused concept.7 Whereas FPIC should be understood as an
[[extension]{.mark} of already [established international
standards]{.mark} regarding the participatory]{.underline} and
[consultation rights of Indigenous peoples]{.underline},8 legislators
and courts in the countries included in this study have thus far not
paid much attention to the concept. Notably, Canada first voted against
the adoption of UNDRIP, primarily because of FPIC, but has recently
started addressing and discussing implementation of UNDRIP as a means
for transformative change in state-Indigenous relationships (see Ch. 4).
Even though domestic courts have made general references to the
Declaration, for instance, regarding its usefulness as an interpretive
aid to Canadian legislation, courts have thus far been reluctant to rely
explicitly on the FPIC standard.9

#### Consultation of indigenous [communities]{.underline} revitalizes [customary international law]{.underline}.

International Law: Indigenous Peoples and Extractive Industries"

Second, land (and other) rights intersect importantly with a set of
[[participatory rights]{.underline}]{.mark} designed to [structure the
[interaction]{.mark} between state [decisionmaking]{.mark} bodies [and
indigenous communities]{.mark} in ways that [require]{.mark} states to
[attend]{.mark} to indigenous [perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline} in
pursuing their objectives. These [participatory rights come in two
flavors: (1) consultation, and (2) free, prior, and informed consent
(FPIC). On [consultation]{.mark}, there [appears]{.mark} to be a [wide
consensus that customary international law]{.mark} at least
[requires]{.mark} that [indigenous peoples]{.mark} be [consulted
regarding]{.mark} any "[development project]{.mark} that is to be
[undertaken within their lands and territories]{.mark}]{.underline},"19
that such consultations must be informed in the sense that communities
must have complete and [precise information on the [nature]{.mark} and
[consequences]{.mark} of the]{.underline} [project]{.underline}
(including social, health, and environmental risks, to be assessed via
impact studies), and that they must be meaningful: that is, conducted in
good faith and in the form of a dialogic process, with the aim of
securing the consent of the peoples concerned (as opposed to a series of
purely formal steps or a single encounter).20 [FPIC is a more
controversial and, at least currently, more limited right]{.underline}.
It applies only in particular and dire situations --- such as (a)
[[development]{.mark} plans or projects that will lead to [forced
displacement]{.mark} of indigenous peoples from [traditional
lands]{.mark}]{.underline}; (b) where [execution]{.underline} of
[development]{.underline} [[plans]{.underline}]{.mark} or extractive
operations would prevent indigenous communities from using their [[lands
and other natural resources]{.mark} as necessary]{.underline} for their
subsistence; or (c) where storage or disposal of hazardous materials is
planned on indigenous-occupied land.21 The [[requirement]{.mark} of
[consultation]{.mark}]{.underline}, and especially of [[consent]{.mark}
in some scenarios]{.underline}, is best understood as an [attempt to
[protect]{.mark} the [essential human rights]{.mark} of indigenous
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} --- including rights to life, cultural
identity, and expression --- that might otherwise be [undermined by
resource-development activities]{.underline}.22

#### International law is increasingly [excluding]{.underline} indigenous people from [cooperation]{.underline} and [recognition]{.underline}. 

Aine **Lawlor 21**, contributor, 2021, "Indigenous Rights in
International Law: A Focus on Extraction in the Arctic",
file:///Users/ennobrandes/Downloads/AineLawlor_HonorsPaper.pdf

As the [domestic [legal setting]{.mark} further [repressed Indigenous
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, [similar [developments]{.mark} [in
international law]{.mark} became [increasingly
solidified]{.mark}]{.underline}. Positivist international legal thinkers
drove the [official [exclusion]{.mark} of Indigenous [peoples from
recognition]{.mark} under international law]{.underline}, evidenced by a
few key tribunals and notable cases covered in this section. This
pattern began to show slight shifts in the early 20th century as
minority rights were given a small platform in the international legal
arena.

[Under the influence of positivist thinking from Vattel and Marshall's
[court decisions]{.mark}, international law [shifted]{.mark} to
[reject]{.mark} any "[consideration]{.mark} of Indigenous peoples as
political bodies with [rights]{.mark} under international
law]{.underline}," which was a [slight difference from earlier
attitudes]{.underline}.49 This happened under four main premises, the
first three premises are that "[[international law]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [[concerned]{.mark} [only]{.mark} with the
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[duties]{.underline}]{.mark} of
states," [that it upholds the "exclusive sovereignty of
states]{.underline}," and that "international law is between and not
above states" through their consent.50 The fourth premise is that
Indigenous peoples do not fall under the "limited universe" of states
that make and are polities to international law. 51 The primary deciding
factor in why Indigenous peoples were excluded from being in this
"family of nations," was because other states did not consent to it---in
other words, the only way to become a nation under international law was
to be recognized as a state by others nation-states who are already in
the 'family.'52 [This concept moved beyond the earlier theories about
justification of conquest through war, and simplified the [legal
legitimation of colonization]{.mark} by providing a legal
mechanism---approval through the 'family of nations'---by which to
justify conquest and [claims to sovereignty]{.mark} over [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} [and territories]{.mark}]{.underline}.53 Thus, these
positivist approaches to international law systematically advantaged
nation-states and this framing formed the foundation for the use of
state sovereignty as a conceptual backing in the oppression of
Indigenous peoples54---an argument that remains relevant today.

There were a [number of important international tribunal
decisions]{.underline} in this time period that [demonstrated the
dominance of positivist thinking]{.underline} and the exclusion of
Indigenous rights in international law. The first was a 1926
international arbitration tribunal ruling that stated that Great
Britain's claim for the "[Cayuga Nation" was not legal]{.underline}, yet
they could make claim to the Cayuga Indians living in Canada because
they were British nationals.55 The [decision [asserted]{.mark} that
Indian tribes were "[not a legal unit of international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}."56 In 1928, an international arbitration
between the United States and the Netherlands ruled in favor of the
Netherlands claim to the Island of Palmas because of its "effective
occupation and display of authority on the island," compared to the US's
inherited claim to prior discovery through Spain.57 Through this
decision, the tribunal ruled that the treaties the Dutch had made with
the Indigenous peoples of the island were merely 'facts' relevant to the
case, but that these types of contracts (ie. treaties with groups not
recognized in the family of states under positivist international law)
were not "capable of creating rights and obligations" "in an
international law sense."58 The third case--- which occurred in 1933 and
is of particular relevance to this paper---was regarding the legal
status of Eastern Greenland. [The Permanent Court of International
Justice ruled that while it recognized the Inuit population in Eastern
Greenland, the territory's legal status was nonetheless defined by
sovereignty claims from the Denmark and Norway]{.underline}.59 This
decision effectively [ignored Inuit claims to territorial
sovereignty]{.underline} or Inuit efforts to block and disrupt Norwegian
and Dutch occupation and colonization, an exemplary illustration of the
positivist hierarchy that placed nation-state sovereignty over
Indigenous sovereignty.60

### I-Law Net-Benefit\-\--CIL Internal Link 

#### [CIL]{.underline} requires [indigenous people]{.underline} be consulted over [Arctic policy]{.underline}.

[[International law]{.mark} provides [rules]{.mark} and arenas to
[further]{.mark} the [interests]{.mark} of [indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are [declarations]{.underline}
passed by the [United Nations]{.underline}, which, while not binding on
states, often receive such wi[despread support that their
[principles]{.mark} are deemed [part of c]{.mark}ustomary
[i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline} and/or of the "[general
[principles of law recognized by civilized nations]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Anaya, Citation2009, pp. 79--82, 124, 151). Two
[declarations]{.underline}, arguably a [[part of
c]{.underline}]{.mark}ustomary [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational
[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}aw or "general principles" [by [reason]{.mark}
of their [recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} by international and state
tribunals, are the [Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline} (United Nations Documents, Citation2007; Lillich,
Hannum, Anaya, & Shelton, Citation2009, pp. 129--139) and the American
Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (Citation1948; Lillich et
al., Citation2009, pp. 227--232).

[[These declarations]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as a
[[variety]{.mark} of [international treaties]{.mark} and
conventions]{.underline}, [[provide support]{.mark} for [indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} in their [struggle to [preserve]{.mark}
physical]{.underline} and [cultural [survival]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
the face]{.mark} of economic [development projects]{.mark}]{.underline}
imposed upon them and [which threaten environmental
sustainability]{.underline}. [[International
treaties]{.underline}]{.mark} and [conventions]{.underline} are
[[binding]{.mark} on signatories and also arguably are [deemed part of
customary international law]{.mark}]{.underline} or "general principles"
(Anaya, Citation2009, pp. 143--144, 128--129).

#### FPIC is an [solidified]{.underline} right under [CIL]{.underline}.

George **Barrie 24**, writer at Brill, 2024, "The 'Right' to Free, Prior
and Informed Consent: Evolving Customary International Law" Chapter 8 in
*Courts and Diversity*, pp 195--227,
https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004691698_009

[[Resolutions]{.mark} of [international
organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular political organs of
the UN, can [play an [important part]{.mark} in the [formation]{.mark}
of [customary international law]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [either as proof
of practice (usus) or as opinio iuris]{.underline}. An [[accumulation of
resolutions]{.mark} may be [evidence]{.mark} of a [collective
practice]{.mark} of states]{.underline}. [Where a resolution specifies
that a practice is a rule of customary international law,]{.underline}
such a resolution may also serve as opinio iuris. [[Measured against
the]{.underline} [requirements]{.underline}]{.mark} [necessary [for
customary international law]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[fpic]{.underline}]{.mark} is moving [inexorably towards meeting [such
demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a vast amount of literature on
the subject animated by what academics are saying about undrip. As
stated by Dayo Ayoade,65 [fpic is [recognized]{.mark} as an emergent
[right under international law]{.mark} and is here to stay]{.underline}.
This is borne out by the many references to case law in various
countries referred to above and is not based on a utopian reading of the
significance of these cases.

#### Binding [consultation]{.underline} aligns [CIL]{.underline}. Development policies without [consultation]{.underline} violates [international standards]{.underline}. 

Rachael Lorna **Johnstone 20**, professor of law at the University of
Akureyri, Iceland, 2020, "What is informed apply? required consent for
free, prior and where does and it", in *Regulation of Extractive
Industries : Community Engagement in the Arctic*, pp. 47-49, eb

Free, Prior and Informed Consent ([[FPIC]{.underline}]{.mark}) The
[evolution of the principle of free]{.underline}, [prior and informed
consent]{.underline} (FPIC) was discussed at length in the previous
chapter. Its inclusion in the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples ([UNDRIP]{.underline}) in [respect of]{.underline}
resource [development marks a signiﬁcant [development]{.mark} in
[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a General Assembly
Resolution, UNDRIP is not intrinsically binding. However, as noted in
the preceding chapter by Emma Wilson, [UNDRIP is [closely
connected]{.mark} to [customary]{.mark} [international law]{.mark}, both
by virtue of [codifying]{.mark} some [pre-existing norms]{.mark} of
[international law]{.mark} and by [encouraging]{.mark} the [necessary
state practice]{.mark} and opinioiuris that [will]{.mark} [lead other
norms to obtain]{.mark} (binding) [customary status]{.mark} over
time]{.underline}. 2 Irrespective of its legal status, there is strong
political commitment to UNDRIP, in particular, from the Danish
government.

The only international treaty dedicated to the rights of indigenous
peoples is ILO Convention 169 on the rights of indigenous and tribal
peoples from 1989 (ILO C169). 3 The Kingdom of Denmark, including
Greenland, has been a party to this convention since 1996. 4 ILO C169
deﬁnes indigenous "land " as " the total environment of the areas which
the peoples concerned occupy or otherwise use " thus clearly including
maritime spaces where there has been longstanding indigenous use. 5
Article 15 requires States to consult with indigenous and tribal people
"with a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their interests
would be pre­judiced " before facilitating extractive projects on
indigenous territory. States should also ensure that indigenous peoples
"wherever possible participate in the bene ﬁ ts of such activities, and
receive fair compensation for any damages. " It further requires that "
measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard the right of
the peoples concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by them, but
to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and
traditional activities. " 6 Indi­ genous peoples should, according to the
convention, " decide their own priorities for the process of development
as it affects their lives, beliefs, institutions and spiritual
well-being and the lands they occupy or otherwise use. " 7 However, ILO
C169 does not require the consent of indigenous peoples whose territory
is exploited unless the interference reaches such a level that they are
forced from their lands. 8

UNDRIP, by contrast, states that: 1 2 [[Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} have the [[right to
determine]{.underline}]{.mark} and [develop
[priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} and stra­ tegies for the [development or
use of their lands or territories]{.underline} and [other
resources]{.underline}. [[States]{.underline}]{.mark} shall
[[consult]{.mark} and cooperate [in good faith]{.mark}]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the [[indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}
concerned through their own representative institutions in order to
[[obtain]{.mark} their free and informed [consent
prior]{.mark}]{.underline} to the [[approval]{.mark} of any [project
affecting]{.mark} their [lands]{.mark} [or]{.mark} territories and other
resources]{.underline}, particularly in connection with the
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}, utilization or exploitation of
mineral, water or other resources. [States]{.underline} shall provide
[[effective mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark} for [just and [fair]{.mark}
redress for any such activities]{.underline}, and [appropriate
measures]{.underline} shall be taken to [mitigate adverse
environmental]{.underline}, economic, social, cultural or spiritual
[impact]{.underline}. 9

#### Governance through [consultation]{.underline} is the [principle]{.underline} of CIL. 

Anna **Sharapova et al 22**, School of Law, Far Eastern Federal
University, 2022, "Indigenous Rights and Interests in a Changing Arctic
Ocean: Canadian and Russian Experiences and Challenges" *Arctic Review
on Law and Politics*, Vol. 13, pp. 286--311,

[[International]{.mark} human rights [law]{.mark}]{.underline} is
[clearly [relevant]{.mark}]{.underline} to all people in the
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether as Indigenous peoples or as
individuals,27 or both.28 Yet [ratification of international human
rights treaties is inconsistent]{.underline} among Arctic states.29
Notably, in recent years, there has been increased attention on the
importance of intersectional human rights issues in the Arctic region,
such as the implications of climate change for the realization of the
human rights of Indigenous women as well as the importance of their
contributions to climate governance.30

[States]{.underline} have acknowledged the [legalzimportance of
[self-determination]{.mark} of peoples]{.underline}, [[including
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}, who seek [sovereignty and
self-[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}, but do not desire to become
sovereign nation states.31 The United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples ([UNDRIP]{.underline}) [highlights the
[relationship]{.mark} between the [human rights]{.mark} of individuals
and the [collective rights]{.mark} of peoples who exercise [internal
self-determi]{.mark}nation.]{.underline} UNDRIP [recognizes significant
[inherent]{.mark} [rights]{.mark} o]{.underline}f Indigenous peoples,
including the right to self-determination; the [right to]{.underline}
[[autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[self-[government]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [right to lands and
territories]{.underline}; and the right to practice and revitalize their
cultural traditions and customs, among others.32 As a United Nations
General Assembly resolution, [UNDRIP is often described as not legally
binding]{.underline}.33 Yet it does [[codify]{.mark} aspects of
[c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline} and
[reflects [norms]{.mark} of self-determination]{.underline} that are
[[well established]{.mark} in [international]{.mark} treaty
[law]{.mark},]{.underline} therefore playing a [significant]{.underline}
role in the [protection of Indigenous peoples']{.underline} rights.34
Moreover, it is arguable that the legal normativity of UNDRIP must be
understood from the perspective of Indigenous peoples themselves, rather
than only through the eyes of states.35 While Canada originally voted
against the adoption of UNDRIP, it later reversed its position and
expressed support. Russia abstained.36

#### Declaration of CIL as [prior]{.underline} and [binding]{.underline} without [state consent]{.underline} crystallizes a [generalized]{.underline} legal order that's [necessary]{.underline} to respond to [existential]{.underline} threats.

International Law Modifies Treaties", Yale Journal of International Law,

[This Article challenges that presumption by presenting situations
[where c]{.mark}]{.underline}ustomary
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational [[l]{.underline}]{.mark}aw has both
[[lessened]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanded states\' treaty rights and
[[obligations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [thereby supporting]{.underline} the
few scholars who have posited - usually in purely theoretical works -
that customary international law may modify treaties. By advancing a
doctrinal justification for such modification based on lex posterior,
[this]{.underline} Article also contributes to the growing literature
[[question]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[whether]{.mark} the legitimacy of
the binding nature of [international]{.mark} legal [obligations
can]{.mark} be [ground]{.mark}ed [solely in]{.mark} state
[consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. This argument is novel to the extent that
it presumes that [[general]{.mark} - rather than universal -
[acceptance]{.mark} of a new customary rule [may be sufficient]{.mark}
to work a treaty modification]{.underline}, thereby [[avoiding the
holdout problem]{.mark} inherent to]{.underline} multilateral [treaty
modification under the Vienna Convention\'s consent-focused rules
(whereby a single state can upset the consensus of the
majority)]{.underline}.

Finally, [this Article advances the counterintuitive argument that this
less consensual basis for treaty modification requires a state to engage
in more consensus-respecting conduct. When a state wishes to argue
against a traditional understanding of a treaty provision, the usual
approach of [adaptive interpretation]{.mark} - attempting [to
reinterpret a]{.mark} treaty\'s [text to permit]{.mark} an [action
previously]{.mark} understood as [forbidden]{.mark} - actually
[encourages]{.mark} states to act [unilat]{.mark}erally [and risk
destabilizing]{.mark} the international [legal order. In contrast, a
state that bases its]{.mark} legal [arg]{.mark}ument [on]{.mark} the
claim that the treaty has been modified by [subsequent]{.mark}ly
developed [c]{.mark}]{.underline}ustomary
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational [[l]{.underline}]{.mark}aw
[[will]{.mark} have to identify and engage in
[coalition-build]{.mark}ing conduct]{.underline}.

Part I reviews how treaties were historically relatively flexible
bilateral agreements concluded against a stable background of default
customary international law. While foundational customary norms and
bilateral agreements are still the norm, today\'s international legal
structure is complicated by a proliferation in multilateral treaties and
an increasing demand for international regulation of new areas,
technologies, objects, actions, and ideas. In the absence of directly
relevant treaty law, and in need of reliable guiding principles, states
are developing practices standardizing their rights and duties in these
new spheres. As a result, treaty text is increasingly running up against
conflicting state action and swiftly developing customary international
law. Part II describes consent-based means of modifying treaties and
concludes that these traditional methods do not legitimately resolve all
conflicts between treaty and later-in-time customary international law.
Part III demonstrates that the possibility of treaty modification by
customary international law has long existed in the international legal
structure and evaluates different doctrinal justifications for such
modification. Part IV employs the threatened U.S. unilateral use of
force in Syria as a case study to tease out the relative benefits and
drawbacks of these different means of treaty modification.

I. A New International Legal Order

Customary international law and treaty law are the two primary sources
of international legal obligations. Sometimes they operate
independently, governing particular fields; sometimes they serve as
mutually reinforcing regulations; sometimes one fills the other\'s
lacunae; sometimes they mandate apparently contradictory actions. As
this Article is concerned with how customary international may modify
treaties, this Part traces how, due to ideological, geopolitical, and
technological developments, the relationship between these two sources
of international legal obligations has grown more complicated and more
prone to conflict.

A. The Classic Account

1\. Stable Customary International Law

A rule of customary international law is recognized as existing when
states generally engage in specific actions (the \"state practice\"
requirement) and accept that those actions are obligatory or permitted
(the \"opinio juris sive necessitatis\" element). Thus, unlike custom in
many domestic legal systems, which derives much of its authority from
its long-standing nature, customary international law has no formal
temporal requirement. Instead, a rule of customary international law is
authoritative because states generally abide by it in the belief that it
is law.

That being said, because of the generalized state practice requirement,
customary international law was slow to develop in a world of limited
communication and sporadic technological advances. Accordingly, historic
customary international law comprised long-established, well-known, and
relatively fixed rules governing relations among all states. It
regulated the recognition of new states and state responsibilities; the
exchange of diplomatic counsels and their immunities; the conduct and
resolution of wars; the creation, interpretation, and termination of
treaties; and other subjects associated with state interaction.

2\. Flexible Treaties

Against this background of static customary norms, states concluded
\[\*243\] bilateral treaties - written documents memorializing
agreements between two states - clarifying their respective legal rights
and duties. These treaties were relatively flexible legal regimes: they
could be modified or terminated with the consent of states parties, by
the conclusion of a subsequent, conflicting treaty between the same
parties, by the denunciation of one party after a material breach by the
other, or by a fundamental change in circumstances or other supervening
event resulting in the impossibility of performing a promised legal
obligation. Additionally, certain types of treaties - for example,
commercial or trading treaties or treaties of alliance - were generally
presumed to allow for unilateral denunciation. Accordingly, treaties
have long been celebrated as a source of adaptive positive law that
reflects states parties\' needs.

B. The Modern World

[[Today\'s international]{.mark} legal [structure is]{.mark} far more
[complicated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certain customary rules still serve
as background defaults governing many areas of state interaction, and
the majority of new treaties are still bilateral. But two factors - [the
rise of [multilat]{.mark}eral [treaties and swift]{.mark}ly developing
[c]{.mark}]{.underline}ustomary [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}nternational
[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}aw - [have [changed the
dynamic]{.mark}]{.underline} between treaty and customary international
law, [resulting in treaties sometimes being the fixed backdrop against
which new state practice and norms develop]{.underline}.

1\. Constitutive Treaties

The past century has seen a dramatic rise in multilateral treaties -
treaties \[\*244\] concluded by multiple countries that often aspire to
universal participation. As early as the 1920s, scholars were
recognizing that there were \"an increasing number of multilateral
treaties.\" According to one study, eighty-six multilateral treaties
were concluded in the century between 1648 through 1748 - but more than
two thousand such treaties were concluded in the twenty-five years
between 1951 and 1975! This [proliferation might be traced to a growing
conviction that certain [global problems]{.mark} - including
[combating]{.mark} the [training and financing of]{.mark} transnational
[terrorist org]{.mark}anization[s, minimizing]{.mark} human-driven
[climate]{.mark} change, [and reducing]{.mark} the development or [use
of w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction - [are best
addressed through global solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

## China Cooperation

#### That\'s key to combatting [climate change]{.underline} which causes [extinction]{.underline} from [feedback loops]{.underline}\-\--independently, cooperation [stabilizes]{.underline} military tensions [regardless]{.underline} of its efficacy.

Crisis?", The Arctic Institute,

吳

The Arctic, warming at nearly three times the global average, is a
glaring focal point for the U.S.-China climate change working group.
[Based on an existing history of bilateral collaborations, [U.S.-China
scientific coop]{.mark}eration [to tackle climate]{.mark} change [in the
Arctic is achievable and]{.mark} can [have]{.mark} meaningful
[benefits]{.mark} even [in the face of]{.mark} mounting
[hostilities]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two countries. This
article focuses on these countries as they are the two largest carbon
dioxide emitters and leaders in the production of knowledge -- as
measured by the number of scientific publications. There is likewise
Chinese scientific cooperation with other Arctic states.

What is China's role in the changing Arctic?

As the largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world, China is fulfilling
its responsibility to the rest of the world to contribute to global
knowledge on climate change. [[China]{.mark}'s rise as an industrial
power [has]{.mark} produced black carbon emissions that have [played a
significant role in the warming
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.2) Conversely, [China is affected by changes
in the Far North. The loss of sea ice and altered wind circulation in
the Arctic was [found to contribute to]{.mark} China's
"[airpocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}" -- severe air pollution that hung
over eastern China for nearly a month in 2013. Scientists warn that the
warming Arctic will continue to have severe effects on China.3) The
climate crisis in the Arctic -- in the form of sea-level rise, loss of
sea ice, and rising ocean and air temperatures -- affects all countries
with no regard for national borders.

[The rapidly changing Arctic and the internationalization of "the Arctic
situation" form the rationale for [Beijing's]{.mark} interests in the
Far North]{.underline}, according to documents published by China's
State Council Information Office.4) China has formalized its Arctic
ambitions with an [official [Arctic Policy]{.mark}]{.underline}
published [in 2018]{.underline} that outlines aims to develop
infrastructure, shipping routes, and energy extraction in the Far North.
The document [[declares]{.mark} that [China is ready to participate in
Arctic governance]{.mark} and work with other nations in scientific
research, academic exchanges, and environmental
observation]{.underline}. "China will improve the capacity and
capability in scientific research on the Arctic \[and\] pursue a deeper
understanding and knowledge of the Arctic science ... so as to create
favorable conditions for mankind to better protect, develop, and govern
the Arctic."5)

However, [[some]{.mark} scholars [argue]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[China's]{.mark} official [approach]{.mark}]{.underline} to polar
research and emphasis on international collaboration [[is]{.mark} for
symbolic reasons]{.underline}. Some analysts argue that Chinese Arctic
science is [meant to advance]{.underline} China's strategic interests in
the region which may ultimately include [a [military]{.mark}
component]{.underline}.6) There is a concern that scientific research
serves a "dual purpose" and is a precursor to the development of Arctic
military technology. For example, Anne-Marie Brady points to studies by
Chinese academics examining the feasibility of Chinese submarines
navigating the Arctic.7)

Can Arctic states cooperate with China in understanding the Arctic if
China's Arctic intentions are still hotly debated?8) [Scientific
[cooperation is still]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} pursuit despite
mounting hostilities and suspicion. [Working together]{.mark} on climate
research [can serve as a stabilizer of uncertainty]{.mark} amid a shift
in the global balance of power]{.underline}. Chinese investments in land
and infrastructure and resource extraction are viewed suspiciously in
Northern European states, although China's scientific engagement has
been positively received.9) Rasmus Gjedssø Bertelsen writes, "\[T\]he
Arctic states and China have used science to integrate China into Arctic
institutions and build Sino-Arctic epistemic communities."10) An
epistemic community is a transnational expert network that shares and
co-creates knowledge about scientific problems and solutions. [Arctic
science diplomacy can [build trust and produce]{.mark} valuable
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### China says Yes\-\--2NC

[Competition and confrontation in the Arctic offer China and the U.S.
another venue for geopolitical posturing]{.underline}, an extension of
their relationship in other places and on other matters. [In practical
terms, however, [the Arctic]{.mark} at present [offers little
reward]{.mark} for the investment required [to further assert]{.mark}
one's presence and one's [power. U.S. sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}
over Alaska and its waters [[is unquestioned. China]{.mark}'s
icebreakers [traverse the Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [for research.
Economic]{.mark} activity and [potential are]{.mark} largely [limited to
land-based resources]{.mark} and locations]{.underline}, such as the
Yamal Peninsula or Alaska's North Slope. Shipping activities are
concentrated along the Northeast Passage and Northern Sea Route, mainly
for transporting raw materials from the Russian Arctic to distant
markets. [Large-scale development of fisheries, deep-sea minerals, or
new shipping lanes is unlikely in the near future. In other words, the
[stakes are low and likely to remain so]{.mark} for some time to
come.]{.underline}

[[Cooperation]{.mark}, on the other hand, [can provide tangible benefits
in the short term as well as]{.mark} better [long-term prospects
for]{.mark} amicable, or at least [non-confrontational,
relations]{.mark} in the Arctic the long term]{.underline}. The CAO
Fisheries Agreement created a Joint Program of Scientific Research and
Monitoring, building on existing modes of scientific cooperation that
involve China, the U.S., and other countries. [All shipping that
connects the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans must go through the Bering
Strait, where [good governance]{.mark} and modern charting [can]{.mark}
help [avoid accidents that would benefit no one]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[In a place with little capacity for search and rescue, [mutual aid
agreements]{.mark} involving more than Arctic coastal states [make good
sense]{.mark}]{.underline}. Small-scale economic interactions, such as
tourism and exports from existing fisheries, offer mutual benefits as
well as a pathway to second-track diplomacy through greater contact
between Chinese and U.S. citizens.

What happens in the Arctic cannot be entirely separated from what
happens elsewhere. [[Arctic exceptionalism]{.mark} does not
[require]{.mark} completely different rules of engagement, [just]{.mark}
a recognition that there are opportunities to try [different ways of
interacting]{.mark}. The risks of pursuing a cooperative relationship in
the Arctic appear to be relatively low. The [benefits]{.mark} include
short-term gains that [more than repay any
investment]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the potential for larger
long-term benefits through decreased tension and greater understanding,
based on actual cooperative experience. If such an outcome is an
appealing alternative to current policy and practice, further research
in this area might consider identifying plausible pathways
(e.g., \[25\]) to achieve some version of a new Arctic exceptionalism,
or to assess the likelihood that various actors---governments,
companies, non-governmental organizations, and others---might be willing
to undertake the actions needed to shift from confrontation to
cooperation in Arctic affairs.

[[Positive examples of]{.mark} effective [consultation]{.mark} between
tribes and the federal government [prove instructive]{.mark} as to what
effective consultation can look like]{.underline} and demonstrates how
parties can incorporate the principles articulated in the ethics and
morality literature. For example, the importance of the
government-to-government relationship is emphasized in the 1994
Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), which addresses management of federal
forest land in the Pacific Northwest within the range of the northern
spotted owl.37 The Record of Decision (ROD) for the NWFP recognizes that
the implementation of the NWFP may affect tribal treaty rights and trust
resources, as restrictions under the NWFP may limit access to tribal
cultural resources; calls for consultation on a government-to-government
basis with tribal governments when treaty-protected lands or trust
resources may be affected.38

Agencies managing federal land within the NWFP region are required to
monitor the effects of implementation and evaluate the conditions and
trends of trust resources identified in treaties with tribes as well as
protections for, access to, and use of forest species, resources, and
places that are in religious and cultural heritage sites.39 These
[monitoring reports have consistently found that, [while consultation is
recognized in fed]{.mark}eral [law]{.mark}]{.underline} and
administrative policy as the primary mechanism for federal agencies to
work with tribes when federal action may impact tribal lands and
resources, [consultation does not always ensure that tribal interests
are upheld]{.underline}. In fact, [[consultation
may]{.underline}]{.mark} in some cases [[be little more than
notification]{.mark} of planned federal action]{.underline}.40 [[This is
evi]{.mark}dence [of]{.mark} what this article concluded
earlier]{.underline}---that although federal law may require
consultation in some areas, [[little guidance]{.mark} is given as to
what effective consultation looks like.]{.underline}

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The NWFP requires a series of monitoring reports to be conducted every
five years to assess a broad spectrum of issues, including populations
and habitat of the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet,
late-successional and old growth forests, watershed conditions,
socio-economic conditions, and the tribal-federal relationship. As an
initial starting point, it is laudable that the NWFP seeks to
re-evaluate the tribal-federal relationship. This is consistent with the
idea expressed in the ethics and morality literature that relationships
should be dynamic partnerships. Since 1999, the USDA Forest Service
Regional Ecosystem Office has published these monitoring reports that
document the status and trends of these issues over time. The most
recent Tribal Monitoring Reports (for the 15-year, 20- year, and
forthcoming 25-year reports) have followed a protocol developed by the
NWFP Tribal Monitoring Advisory Group to examine consultation processes,
the affect of the NWFP on tribal values of interest (including cultural,
social, and economic resources), and strategies to strengthen
federal-tribal relations. To accomplish this, the monitoring team has
reached out to tribal council members and tribal staff from all of the
75 federally recognized tribes with tribal lands and/or territories
within the NWFP boundary in Washington, Oregon, and California in order
to assess the impacts of the NWFP on tribes. Approximately 1/3 of the
tribes within the NWFP region have participated in each of the past
three monitoring reports.41 Pursuant to the interview protocol
established by the Tribal Monitoring Advisory Group, the recommendations
in the monitoring reports have focused on consultation, tribal rights,
and access to cultural resources and improving the compatibility of
federal-tribal forest management practices. In all of the tribal
monitoring reports, many of the respondents focused on the need for more
effective consultation that would move agency practices from merely
notifying tribes of proposed actions to engaging tribes to work with
federal agencies to develop strategies that would meet tribal cultural
resource management objectives. Recommendations to strengthen
consultation focused on increasing agency accountability for meeting the
federal trust responsibility through staff education and training;
developing formal agreements for consultation and
government-to-government interactions, such as memorandums of
understandings; and ensuring that agency and tribal leadership
understand and come to agreement about consultation policies and
practices.42 The NWFP tribal monitoring reports have also examined the
extent to which tribal rights and access to cultural resources have been
impacted by the NWFP. The 20-year tribal monitoring report describes
some of the ways that tribal rights and access to resources have been
impacted by the NWFP, including "road closure, decreased ability to
harvest traditional cultural resources, reduced economic opportunities,
and limitations on land management."43 Recommendations to improve tribal
rights and access to cultural resources under the NWFP focus on training
agency staff across all levels to ensure strong cultural competency in
tribal matters, reviewing and updating policies that severely impact
tribes' rights to interact with traditional lands and resources, and
adopting practices that protect sensitive tribal and traditional
knowledge. The NWFP monitoring reports also look at federal-tribal
forest management compatibility. Interviews that took place for the
20-year tribal monitoring report described some ways that federal forest
management practices align with tribal values, restoration and
protection of fish and wildlife habitat, and the incorporation of tribal
forest management practices in agency land management (e.g., prescribed
fire). Some of the ways that respondents described incompatibilities in
tribal and federal forest management included prioritization of timber
and industry over other forest resources and tribal needs, lack of
incorporation of traditional knowledge and tribal values into
management, an all-or-nothing approach that could deplete ecosystems or
impact economies.44 Recommendations to improve the compatibility of
federal-tribal forest management focus on increasing formal consultation
and collaborative approaches between federal agencies and tribes to
enhance the compatibility of federal-tribal forest management practices.
This would increase opportunities for tribal leadership in land
management decisions and leverage opportunities for funding and
resources to support tribal natural resource departments. A 2018
synthesis of science to inform land management within the NWFP area
examined strategies to promote tribal ecocultural resource management
and effectively engage tribes in forest management and planning.
Ensuring effective consultation was among the recommendations included
in the report, along with strategies for bolstering federal-tribal
collaboration, coordination, and cooperative management of tribally
valued cultural resources.45 The NWFP, with its five-year review cycle
and constant reflection on what constitutes effective consultation
tribes with area tribes, demonstrates the principles for effective
consultation articulated in the ethics and morality and Indigenous
studies literature. This is because the ideal of consent, as a moral
norm, suggests a relationship between the United States, tribes, and
other parties that establishes collaborative processes and partnerships
as mechanisms to help achieve more effective consultation. Conclusion:
Strengthening Federal-Tribal Relationships to Address Climate Change and
Fossil Fuel Industries

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

[The government-to-government relationship is a formal mechanism for
Indigenous peoples to interact with non-Indigenous entities in order to
protect Indigenous cultural connections to the earth, address climate
change at multiple scales, and negotiate policies to avoid multiple
oppressions]{.underline}. Based on lessons gleaned from these examples,
coupled with guidance from the morality and ethics literature, this
section describes strategies to strengthen federal-tribal relations and
effectiveness of consultation. Such [[strategies and considerations are
incredibly valuable given]{.mark} the [absence of effective
guidance]{.mark} provided [by existing]{.mark} federal
[law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, while this analysis focused on
climate change and fossil fuel industries, the same considerations about
consultation are important for other risks faced in Indian country with
the emergence of the energy transition. Previously mentioned cases
involving lack of consultation in solar energy and hydropower are
illustrative of this need.

1\. [Establish a common understanding of the role, purpose, and
principles of "consultation." Consultation policies are not the sole
domain of nontribal agencies]{.underline}---[tribes may have their own
consultation policies to address the many different policies under which
agencies operate]{.underline}, and both agencies and tribes can initiate
consultation. [[Agencies and tribes must remain on equal terms]{.mark}
through consultation processes [so that]{.mark} conflicts are
[no]{.mark}t resolved by a presumption that [agencies have the final
word]{.mark} over tribes]{.underline}. [[Ensur]{.mark}ing that [tribes
are treated as equal sovereigns]{.mark}]{.underline} in consultation and
can initiate their own consultation processes [can [lessen]{.mark} some
of the [powerlessness and lack of respect]{.mark} that many Indigenous
peoples face in relations with non-Indigenous nation
states]{.underline}. Indigenous traditions of consultation should be
considered as among the most important intellectual bases for
envisioning roles, purposes, and principles. Consent, in particular,
must be discussed as a key guiding norm for consultation.

2\. Assess and build knowledge about the federal trust responsibility,
government-to-government relationships, and consultation. The extent to
which tribal and nontribal partners understand and are responsive to the
federal-tribal relationship will directly affect the ability of agencies
and tribes to engage meaningfully on climate change and other resource
management issues. Research ecologist Frank Lake notes that trust and
understanding between tribes and nontribal partners can increase the
effectiveness of research and management: "it is imperative that
managers and researchers understand and use formal and culturally
sensitive approaches for contacting tribal government and community
members."46

3\. Agency climate change policies, research, resources, and plans
should directly and meaningfully address issues related to Indigenous
communities in the United States. When agency programs and initiatives
related to climate change only include tribes as general stakeholders,
they may fail to recognize the contributions that Indigenous communities
in the United States can offer in addressing climate change, as well as
the implications that climate change may have on off-reservation tribal
resources and ancestral territory.

4\. [[Recognize]{.mark} the role [and protect]{.mark} the use of
[t]{.mark}raditional [k]{.mark}nowledge [in climate]{.mark} change
[initiatives]{.mark}. Some tribes have adopted their own policies and
programs to assess and adapt to climate change impacts on resources of
concern, and many of these efforts incorporate the use of traditional
knowledge]{.underline}. Traditional knowledge can play an important role
in understanding the impacts from climate change and identifying
strategies for adaptation. Federal-tribal consultation on
climate-change-related issues should involve procedures and agreements
when traditional knowledge is involved as well as strategies to ensure
the protection of culturally sensitive tribal information from
disclosure.47 [[This]{.mark} recommendation [avoids]{.mark} the
[cultural imperialism]{.mark} implicit [in policies where t]{.mark}ribal
[k]{.mark}nowledge [is not given a fair seat at the table]{.mark} in
terms of informing policy and climate-change-related
research.]{.underline}

5\. [[Examine how]{.mark} the [impacts of climate]{.mark} change on the
quantity and distribution of culturally important species will [affect
tribal access]{.mark} to and management of these tribal resources on-and
off-reservation. Climate change may result in changes to ecological
processes as well as the quantity and distribution of species that have
cultural and economic importance to tribes]{.underline}.48 These shifts
create the need to examine treaty rights and federal land management
obligations in consulting with tribes to assess and plan for the
potential socio-economic and ecological impacts from climate change.
There is a need to examine how tribal rights and access to culturally
important resources (both on- and off-reservation) will be affected by
the impacts from climate change. [[This]{.mark} level of investigation
[must happen at a local level and through direct consultation and
collaboration]{.mark} between tribal and agency leadership and staff to
identify strategies to protect tribal access to these resources in the
future.]{.underline}

#### Involving indigenous peoples key to [combating climate change]{.underline}

**Hofschneider 23** \[11/16/23, Anita Hofschneider is a journalist
writing about climate change, the environment, and the Pacific region
for Grist's Indigenous Affairs desk, "Indigenous Self-Determination Is
Key Climate Solution in New Report," Yes Magazine,
https://www.yesmagazine.org/climate/2023/11/16/report-climate-change-indigenous\]MZ

Many [Indigenous communities also lack data on their flood
risk]{.underline}, a problem that [reflects]{.underline} broader
[climate-related data gaps for Native peoples]{.underline} that the
report repeatedly noted. Despite the input of hundreds of expert
collaborators, the report noted the absence of data on Indigenous
peoples, including missing maps of historical ancestral homelands in
American Samoa, [missing data on wildfire risks to the U.S's island
territories, and a broad lack of environmental data from Indian
Country]{.underline}. The absence of data, the authors noted, represents
a major systemic obstacle that impedes policymaking.

Similarly, the report found that local, state, [and [federal
governments]{.mark} often [don't do enough to involve Indigenous peoples
in climate change response planning]{.mark}]{.underline}. Native
communities that pursue such planning themselves are often hampered by
lack of funding and staffing. Even when money is available to [fund
[Indigenous-led projects]{.mark}]{.underline}, the money streams may not
be constructed in a way to be actually accessible. [[Renewable energy
projects]{.mark}, such as a wind farm]{.underline} pursued by the
Rosebud Sioux Nation, for example, have faced many challenges, including
inadequate funding, questions about ownership of infrastructure, and
bureaucratic hoops.

The report concludes that [[supporting Indigenous self-determination is
necessary]{.mark} to ensure Native communities' needs are
met]{.underline}, but also found that those efforts are undermined by
policies and institutions that uphold state, local, or federal policies
or prioritize the needs of the private sector.

"[The right to self-determination]{.underline} means Ind[igenous peoples
should be in the position to make decisions about how [to respond to
climate change]{.mark} in ways that meet community-defined
needs]{.underline} and aspirations," the report says.

Nationally[, [Native people lead more than 1,000 efforts to address
climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, [drawing up [hundreds of climate
change]{.mark} adaptation and [mitigation plans]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
Washington state, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community cultivates clam
gardens to fight ocean acidification; in California, the Karuk Tribe has
fought for their right to conduct prescribed burns.

[[Climate change poses]{.mark} an \"[existential threat]{.mark}\" [to
life]{.mark} on Earth]{.underline}, prominent scientists warned Tuesday,
in an assessment on this year\'s avalanche of [heat records and weather
extremes]{.underline} that they said are [hitting more ferociously than
expected.]{.underline}

With expectations that 2023 will be the hottest year on record,
[[regions]{.mark} across the planet have been [scorched by
deadly]{.mark} [heat waves]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Others have been hit by floods, or in some cases, have
[suffered]{.mark} both [extremes]{.mark} in quick
succession.]{.underline}

\"The truth is that we are shocked by the ferocity of the extreme
weather events in 2023. We are afraid of the uncharted territory that we
have now entered,\" said an international coalition of authors in a new
report published in the journal BioScience.

Their stark assessment: \"[[Life on]{.mark} planet [Earth is under
siege]{.mark}]{.underline}\".

They said [[humanity]{.mark} had [made]{.mark} \"[minimal progress\" in
curbing]{.mark} its planet-heating [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
[major greenhouse gases at record levels, and subsidies for fossil fuels
soaring last year.]{.underline}

The damning assessment comes just a month ahead of UN COP28 climate
negotiations to be held in oil-rich United Arab Emirates.

\"We must [[shift]{.mark} our [perspective]{.mark} on the climate
emergency [from]{.mark} being just an isolated [environmental
issue]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a systemic, [existential
threat]{.mark}]{.underline},\" the authors said.

The study on the state of the climate looked at recent data on 35
planetary \"vital signs\" and found 20 of these were at record extremes
this year.

[Significant changes to global carbon cycling are of consequence to
military strategic planning. There is potential for [global climate
tipping points]{.mark} to be surpassed; several of which [are directly
linked to Arctic change]{.mark}]{.underline} and all of which are
showing movement towards greater risk potential. In the Arctic these
tipping points include the physical integrity of permafrost, stability
of the Greenland ice sheet, and the strength of the major Atlantic Ocean
conveyor belt, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC),
which contains the Gulf Stream. A 2022 OECD report on climate tipping
points concluded, "that [crossing tipping points is [increasingly likely
at]{.mark} even [low levels]{.mark} of global warming]{.underline}, with
[the [time]{.mark} remaining to avoid such disastrous outcomes [rapidly
running out]{.mark}]{.underline}\.... the earlier generally accepted
advice -- that the risk of crossing tipping points is low -- can no
longer be accepted."16

[[Permafrost is found extensively throughout the]{.mark} North American
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Greenland, Canada and the U.S.) [and
Russia. Roughly 80% of Alaska is underlaid by permafrost, and three of
the state's four major military bases]{.underline} -- Eielson Air Force
Base, Fort Wainwright and Clear Space Force Station -- [are already
incurring costs]{.underline} from the effects of discontinuous
permafrost thaw.17 Around 65% of Russia is underlaid by permafrost, and
in 2021 the Minister of Natural Resources, Alexander Kozlov, stated the
Russian economy was poised to lose more than \$67 billion by 2050 from
permafrost damage to infrastructure alone.18

[Permafrost [thaw]{.mark}]{.underline} in Russia, Canada and Alaska [has
the potential to [undermine military infrastructure]{.mark}, including
radar sites,]{.underline}19 [ports, and runways]{.underline}.20 The U.S.
Defense Department's concept of operations is being pushed to evolve in
the face of climate change and the energy transition. [Modifications and
investment are needed for site-specific resilience measures aimed at
supporting military infrastructure, installations, equipment and
personnel]{.underline}.21 [Assumptions that a runway or port will remain
intact and accessible]{.underline} -- provided it is not targeted by a
human adversary -- [are being challenged as [warming causes
sinkholes]{.mark} to form, [roads]{.mark} and [runways]{.mark} to
buckle, [and coastlines to be]{.mark} severely [degraded]{.mark} by
storm surge, erosion, and land subsidence.]{.underline}

[Permafrost thaw]{.underline} not only undermines the integrity of
Arctic infrastructure but [[also contributes to warming through]{.mark}
the [release of]{.mark} enormous quantities of [methane and carbon
dioxide]{.mark}, [as well as]{.mark} threatening human health through
the release of an array of biological, chemical, and [radioactive
compounds]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 For instance, [[exposing]{.mark}
naturally occurring [underground uranium deposits]{.mark} to oxygen can
cause decay and the release of significant amounts of radon]{.underline}
-- [a leading [cause]{.mark} of [lung cancer]{.mark}. This could result
in increased atmospheric radon concentrations]{.underline}23
[[and]{.mark} have direct [impacts]{.mark} on [indoor air
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}.24

The AMOC contains the Gulf Stream, which is responsible for strategic
ports such as Tromsø in Norway and Murmansk in Russia being ice-free
throughout the year. It is directly linked to weather patterns from
Europe to North America. [As the Arctic warms and melts]{.underline},
the Arctic Ocean is becoming less saline and less dense. These [factors
combine to diminish the strength of the pump that keeps the
[AMOC]{.mark} circulating]{.underline}. [Such changes have additional
operational implications given that they [impact]{.mark} the propagation
of sound waves in underwater acoustics, which are of particular
importance to [anti-submarine warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}.25
Year-round, in situ data collection is necessary for monitoring changes
as they evolve. While an abrupt change of state in the AMOC is viewed as
very unlikely by the IPCC, it would have profound impacts were it to
happen, so should be included in low-probability, high-impact
assessments.

[The AMOC and other [Arctic]{.mark}-linked climate [tipping points are
linked to tipping points elsewhere]{.mark} in the world, [such as the
Amazon]{.mark}'s status as a rainforest versus becoming a
savanna]{.underline}. [There is risk that [if one]{.mark} critical
climate tipping point's threshold [were]{.mark} to be [toppled it could
create a domino effect]{.mark} that impacts stability of the entire
climate system]{.underline}.26

Changing strategies and new tasks

[The Russian Arctic contains several climate change
hotspots]{.underline}, such as the sea areas around Novaya Zemlya, which
have been warming "up to seven times as fast as the global average."27
[Russia's northern flank is becoming more exposed [as sea ice]{.mark}
retreats, and Russia's remilitarization of its Arctic zone]{.underline}
-- in the years prior to their cataclysmic decision to wage war against
Ukraine in February 2022 -- [was partially a response to this increased
threat perception]{.underline}. These strategic sites have both
defensive and offensive capabilities, and in the new security
environment have taken on greater significance. At the heart of Russia's
bastion defence concept -- and at the core of the Arctic's strategic
significance to Russia -- is the Kola Peninsula, which houses Russia's
strategic submarines.

[Russia has significant strategic military infrastructure in the
Arctic]{.underline}, most if not all of which will be exposed to one or
more climate hazards. Given that the extent of risks to infrastructure
are only just beginning to be understood and changes are accelerating,
[[this may heighten the Kremlin's]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and
particularly President Vladimir Putin's --- [perception of
[vulnerability]{.mark}, which experts have [linked to]{.mark} a higher
likelihood of Russia resorting to "nonconventional tools, including
[cyberattacks]{.mark}, [disinfo]{.mark}rmation campaigns, [covert
op]{.mark}eration[s and nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}."28 Indeed,
[Russia's Arctic policy]{.underline} through 2035 [identifies the
inability of the existing Arctic environmental monitoring network to
adequately respond to environmental challenges as a significant
threat]{.underline}.29

### Climate (Green Technology)\-\--2NC 

**Solves better than the aff and prevents the perpetuation of green
colonialism**

//AChiong

[[Indigenous communities]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} have
something to say about climate change---namely, that with the proper
support in policy- and decision-making, they [[are
resilient]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many [[Indigenous hunters]{.mark},
fishers, herders, harvesters and other knowledge holders have [provided
countless records of climate change's]{.mark} disruption to the
stability of snow, ice, water, ecosystem dynamics and wildlife
populations]{.underline}. Now, VICTORIA QUTUUQ BUSCHMAN explains, [the
world is beginning to recognize that Indigenous communities [have
considerable strength and adaptive capacity to provide solutions]{.mark}
to the impacts of climate change.]{.underline}

On February 28, 2022, the global community received the new
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on the impacts,
adaptation and vulnerabilities of ecosystems, biodiversity and people
amid climate change. In part, the report explains what's at stake and
how we're attempting to address these issues.

But this isn't the first report to make a strong call for the support of
Indigenous communities and practices. The 2019 [IPCC Special Report on
Climate Change and Land recognized that [Indigenous communities actively
safeguard]{.mark} the [biodiversity]{.mark} within their
homelands.]{.underline} The 2022 report reiterates what Arctic
Indigenous communities have always known: [that we [have the knowledge
and practices to identify]{.mark} impacts, [evaluate]{.mark} risks [and
adapt to climatic changes as long as we prioritize **self-determination,
Indigenous rights and inclusive governance.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Recognizing the legacy of colonialism

Indigenous authors---including Dr. Tero Mustonen, head of Snowchange
Cooperative in Finland, and Dr. Dalee Sambo Dorough, chair of the Inuit
Circumpolar Council---led a body of experts across the circumpolar North
in developing the report's assessment of the impacts of climate change
on Indigenous Peoples and the implications for adaptation and governance
in the Arctic. The report recognizes that the legacy of colonialism is
behind Arctic Indigenous Peoples' climate vulnerability. Land
dispossession and displacement, the introduction and proliferation of
carbon-intensive economies, discrimination, racism, marginalization, and
social, cultural and health inequities all limit Indigenous Peoples'
abilities to respond to impacts effectively.

These impacts include human health risks and injuries related to
unpredictable and unsafe environmental conditions on land, water and
ice. They also include food insecurity and the instability of harvested
food sources, which are affected by changes in seasons and preparation
conditions as well as shifts in the sizes and structures of populations.

In addition, waterborne diseases have emerged, and pathogens such as
anthrax and smallpox have the potential to resurface in buried carcasses
as permafrost thaws. Additional impacts include mental health problems
related to climate change and heightened by colonial contexts, the
stress of livelihoods and culture continually upended by climate
impacts, and the inflexibility of policies and laws that were not
designed to accommodate rapid environmental change.

[Resilience linked to self-determination]{.underline}

Despite these challenges, Indigenous communities display inherent
climate resilience---a quality that is important for adapting to climate
change. There is growing recognition that this [[resilience is linked
to]{.mark} Indigenous [self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IPCC
calls for equity by recognizing that Indigenous communities' ability to
adapt to climate change is linked to this self-determination in
adaptation strategies, governance and ecosystem-based policies. It also
acknowledges that [[developing]{.mark} local definitions of social and
economic success and culturally legitimate government and [leadership
is]{.mark} a [significant]{.mark} part of this process.]{.underline}

[Recognizing Indigenous knowledge as a valuable and valid way of
knowing]{.underline} is another. The document calls for [the use of
Indigenous knowledge in planning, decision-making and management
processes, and in implementing adaptation.]{.underline}

[The Arctic provides ecosystem services for Indigenous
communities]{.underline}. In turn, [[Indigenous]{.mark} knowledge can
detect change, evaluate risk and inform adaptation. I]{.underline}t also
provides cultural ecological services. Despite barriers to the use of
knowledge in institutions and international fora---and within research,
management and implementation processes---Indigenous knowledge-based
solutions and inclusive ecosystem-based policies have shown the ability
to [[address climate change]{.mark} impacts.]{.underline} To continue to
do so moving forward, we need to create or [[improve
decision-making]{.mark} processes and adaptive management in human
[health,]{.mark} [Arctic shipping]{.mark}, tourism, reindeer herding,
commercial [fisheries,]{.mark} marine and terrestrial [subsistence, and
other areas]{.mark} of Indigenous concerns.]{.underline}

New tools needed

[This shift may [require new research, management, monitoring,
assessment, policy and governance structures]{.mark} that are equipped
to address the needs of Arctic Indigenous Peoples.]{.underline}

For example, research and climate modelling that focus on Indigenous
objectives are useful to communities planning to tackle issues such as
shoreline erosion, permafrost thaw, flooding, and changing wildlife
populations and food web dynamics. [[Developing green
technologies]{.mark} in partnership [with Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} can
[ensure]{.mark} that green [energy does not continue as a colonial,
externally imposed]{.mark} and inequitable [burden]{.mark} placed on
those already impacted and marginalized amid climate
change.]{.underline} Removing the external pressures that limit
autonomous evaluation, self-assessment and the response to climate
change---such as the often inflexible and centralized policies imposed
by state governments---can also support community-led adaptation.

[In the absence of national and international adaptation strategies in
the Arctic, [Indigenous communities are moving]{.mark} forward [with
adaptations at smaller scales]{.mark}.]{.underline} These contributions
may seem small, but they are being seen and heard around the world.
[[Supporting]{.mark} Indigenous communities' ability to make the
necessary [decisions]{.mark} and changes [will ensure a more resilient,
secure and equitable future for Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples [and]{.mark}
a healthier planet for [all.]{.mark}]{.underline}

1. Introduction

1.1. Indigenous knowledge vs. scientific knowledge: a brief overview

[[Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} (IK) is deeply rooted in the
cultural and environmental contexts of Indigenous peoples,
[[covering]{.mark} land use, [ecosystems, medicinal plants, sustainable
ag]{.mark}riculture, and traditional healing practices which
cumulatively covers [environmental conservation,]{.mark} agriculture,
[and healthcare]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Whyte,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib150), [Jessen
et al.,
2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib60)).
For context, IK refers to the long-standing traditions, and intimate
knowledge of local ecosystems, biodiversity, and social systems
developed by indigenous peoples and local communities over time
([Berkes,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib16)).
IK, often perceived as informal, [is increasingly recognized as [a
sophisticated and dynamic system]{.mark} of understanding that is
[rooted in]{.mark} systematic [observation,]{.mark} empirical
[experimentation, and adaptive practices]{.mark}]{.underline}. Contrary
to the outdated view that positions IK as unscientific, researchers have
demonstrated that many indigenous practices are [[based on centuries of
trial-and-error]{.mark}, hypothesis testing, [and]{.mark} environmental
[monitoring]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}[Berkes,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib17)).
For instance, traditional agricultural systems, such as those of the
Andean and African highlands, utilize complex soil and crop rotation
techniques that are not only ecologically sustainable but also tailored
to local microclimates---evidence of experimental and iterative
knowledge development ([Altieri,
2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib8)).

IK is a knowledge that is primarily preserved in the minds of
individuals and communities and is not physically documented ([Basdew et
al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib14), [Sraku-Lartey,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib132)).
It is often passed down orally from generation to generation and is
closely connected to the worldviews, values, and spirituality of
indigenous communities ([Agrawal,
1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib2)).
It is disseminated through various routes, such as children and elders
reciting stories, social, religious, or agricultural organizations
collecting records in the form of drawings, photographs, or sculptures,
and direct observation of the environment ([Basdew et al.,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib14), [Macchi
et al.,
2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib73)).
While IK is a critical part of society ([Sraku-Lartey,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib132))
that is passed down through generations, its magnitude decreases as
elders die and children move to cities and towns ([Elia et al.,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib39)).

[IK has been used for a long time, with evidence from the 1970s
suggesting it could [increase disaster preparedness]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Dekens,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib33)).
However, practitioners have only recently started to incorporate such
materials in policymaking and planning ([McAdoo et al.,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib79)).
[IK has been [instrumental in]{.mark} [helping]{.mark} rural subsistence
farming [groups adapt to climatic change]{.mark} and make daily
agricultural decisions, serving as [a means of survival for
millennia]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Lebel,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib71), [Graaff
et al.,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib46)).

Despite the efficacy of the indigenous knowledge systems (IKS), the
increase in the emphasis on a structured and systematic approach to
understanding the natural world through observation, experimentation,
and analysis as embodied in [the scientific knowledge (SK) system seems
to erode the wisdom and legitimacy of IK]{.underline} ([Goduka,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib45), [Ramirez
et al.,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib111)).
The relationship between IK and SK illustrates a [[vibrant exchange of
coexistence]{.mark} and opposition between the two systems of
knowledge.]{.underline} These two systems of knowledge embody unique
epistemologies, each with its strengths, methods, and outlooks on the
world[. Their coexistence [offers chances for mutual
enhancement]{.mark}, but resistance frequently arises from contrasting
views on how knowledge is validated, power dynamics, and the importance
of cultural preservation]{.underline} ([Rist and Dahdouh-Guebas,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib114)[).
Both IK and SK aim to comprehend and tackle issues like environmental
sustainability, resource management, and health.]{.underline} Although
they employ different methods, their [[common dedication to finding
solutions]{.mark} to similar community/environmental challenges [lays
the foundation for cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Priyadarshini and
Abhilash,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib107)).

IK channels play a vital role in [promoting adaptation and adjustments
in agricultural practices]{.underline} by providing valuable insights
into the communities, their efforts, and their agricultural situations
([Ifejika Speranza et al.,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib58), [Rosenthal,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib115)[).
[Supporting]{.mark} these [indigenous channels]{.mark} enables
researchers and financial organizations to access crucial information,
thereby [foster]{.mark}ing community [development]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Rosenthal,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib115)).
However, despite its importance, [[IK is not]{.mark} always [given the
recognition it deserves.]{.mark}]{.underline}

IK represents a culturally specific approach to agriculture that varies
across different cultures ([Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al.,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib157)).
It includes daily projections and seasonal forecasting, with indigenous
data guiding the timing of planting and harvesting ([Radeny et al.,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib109)).
[[Scientific advancements]{.mark}, as noted by ]{.underline}[[Raymond et
al.
(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib113),
have [contributed to increased crop yields]{.mark} and [effective pest
and disease management]{.mark}.]{.underline} These advancements are
often documented and acknowledged as theories and principles ([Laudan,
1978](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib70)).
Moreover, scientific progress has [[addressed many global issues,
including climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Oerke,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib98)).

Rural areas often lack access to modern technology ([Zomers,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib155)),
making it difficult for them to learn and apply modern and efficient
adaptation and mitigative practices ([Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al.,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib157)).
Scientific weather data is often difficult to understand for non-expert
community members, making decision-making difficult ([Zuma-Netshiukhwi
et al.,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib157)).
By combining indigenous and scientific information, rural farmers can
improve their agricultural operations holistically ([DeWalt,
1994](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib34)).

[Raymond et al.
(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib113) [discuss
the significant challenges associated with integrating knowledge
systems, [emphasizing the need for]{.mark} the successful
[incorporation]{.mark} of information [to ensure authenticity and
validation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nah et al.
(2004)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib90) underscore
the importance of thoroughly examining the integration process,
techniques, and outputs to maximize the benefits for end-users. While it
is crucial for SK to supplement existing IK and (vice-versa) and enhance
decision-making in fields such as disaster management, agriculture,
healthcare, and environmental conservation ([Lebel,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib71)),
some critics argue that the integration process often faces practical
and ethical obstacles ([Shizha,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib124)).
One criticism is that SK may overshadow IK, reducing the latter\'s
perceived value and undermining the cultural and historical significance
of indigenous practices ([Rist and Dahdouh-Guebas,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib114)).
Additionally, the integration process can be complicated by differing
epistemological approaches and power dynamics between the two knowledge
systems[. It is essential to [ensure that IK]{.mark} is not merely
validated by scientific methods, but that [its unique contributions are
recognized and respected]{.mark} in their own right. [Without careful
consideration,]{.mark} the integration process [risks
reinforcing]{.mark} existing [inequalities]{.mark} and marginalizing
indigenous communities.]{.underline}

[The integration of IK and SK has been [of interest to]{.mark}
researchers, [policymakers]{.mark}, and practitioners in areas such as
environmental management, climate change adaptation, agriculture, and
healthcare]{.underline} ([Gadgil et al.,
1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib43); [Brondízio
et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib24), [Rist
and Dahdouh-Guebas,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib114)).
The use of IK in conjunction with SK is increasing in popularity
([Stevenson,
1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib133), [McNie,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib84)),
[[but there is no formal framework to]{.mark} illustrate how these two
can reduce community vulnerability issues such as disaster and general
environmental impacts]{.underline} ([Zulfadrim et al.,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib156)).
Integrating IK and SK [[offers]{.mark} a robust opportunity to address
modern challenges and [leverage]{.mark}s [the strengths of both
knowledge systems]{.mark}.]{.underline} IK provides centuries of
observational expertise and interaction with local environments, while
SK utilizes systematic methods to analyse and quantify ecological data.
Together, [these perspectives lead to more comprehensive and effective
conservation and management strategies, enhancing our ability to
sustainably interact with and protect natural ecosystems.]{.underline}

This research focuses on the integration of IK and SK to address
contemporary global challenges, specifically environmental conservation,
agriculture, and healthcare[. The review uses literature to demonstrate
the strengths and limitations of integrating these knowledge
systems,]{.underline} aiming to provide a more holistic and effective
approach. The review also indicates insights for theoretical
contributions to the existing knowledge system.

1.2. Conceptual framework for the integration of indigenous and
scientific knowledge: insights for theoretical contributions to the
existing knowledge system

The integration of IK and SK provides valuable theoretical insights that
enhance our understanding of knowledge systems ([Chapman and Schott,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib28)[).
This integration [fosters the development of cooperative knowledge
system]{.mark}s that transcend disciplinary boundaries and [promote
intercultural communication]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Slikkerveer,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib127)).
By incorporating both indigenous and scientific frameworks into theories
of information exchange and collaboration, we gain a deeper
understanding of complex issues and potential solutions ([Mecer et al.,
2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib85)).
This approach [calls for more interdisciplinary and cross-cultural
methods of knowledge generation, challenging the compartmentalized
structure of academic fields]{.underline}. These insights question
traditional, compartmentalized views of knowledge and offer more
dynamic, inclusive, and sophisticated frameworks for understanding the
production, validation, and use of knowledge ([Langdon,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib68)).

The integration of IK and SK also leads to the creation of new ethical
frameworks for intellectual property and knowledge exchange
([Slikkerveer,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib127)[).
It [challenges the historically exploitative relationships between
Indigenous]{.mark} communities [and external researchers,
emphasizing]{.mark} the importance of [equity and respect]{.mark} in the
use of IK]{.underline} ([Orozco and Poonamallee,
2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib103)).
This integration advocates for a fair and equitable system where
indigenous groups retain control over their knowledge and benefit from
its use in global contexts ([Gebru,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib44)).
For example, ethical considerations in using traditional medicinal
knowledge for drug research highlight the importance of consent, fair
compensation, and cultural sensitivity ([Timmermans,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib140)).

Research by [Zulfadrim et al.
(2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib156) indicates
that IK evolves and is typically transmitted from one generation to the
next through oral histories, myths, songs, and tales. IK can be
categorized based on how it is acquired and transmitted ([Dekens,
2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib33)),
its aspects (traditions, religions, beliefs, culture), and local
knowledge (coping mechanisms over time). It can also be classified based
on practices, including common knowledge from everyday activities and
specialist knowledge held by selected community members and elders.

[Mecer et al.
(2010)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib85) propose
that [merging IK and SK can lead to [more effective risk
mitigation,]{.mark} bridging the gap between these knowledge systems.
Integrating both systems [requires a **shared understanding** of each
system\'s cultural and material foundations]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}([Zulfadrim et al.,
2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib156), [Agrawal,
1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib2)).
IK is culture-specific and distinct from SK, which is based on
scientific research conducted in research institutions. SK systems are
part of society and contribute to humanity\'s scientific and technical
progress ([Hodson,
2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib54)).

Science and IK are interconnected, and their issues cannot be addressed
separately ([Ravetz,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib112)).
For example, [IK provides abundant agricultural knowledge and management
methods (]{.underline}[[Brush,
2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib25)).
While the use of synthetic fertilizers and large-scale pesticide inputs
in [industrial agriculture]{.mark} has led to numerous
problems]{.underline} ([Bhuyan et al.,
2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib20)), [Sarkar
et al.
(2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib120) suggest
that traditional agricultural wastes can be transformed into sustainable
and organic renewable inputs, such as plant sprays made from cow urine,
yoghurt, milk, and butter, which can replace synthetic pesticides and
foliar sprays with negative environmental impacts.

[Water is a limited natural resource that must be managed
wisely]{.underline}. At the Third World Water Forum in Kyoto, Japan
(2003), [Indigenous participants expressed their views on [water
management]{.mark} in the Indigenous Peoples' Kyoto Water
Declaration]{.underline} ([McGregor,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib81)).
Since then, it has been advocated that global water governance
frameworks align with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples ([Taylor et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib135)).
IK should be considered in water management decisions ([McGregor,
2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib81)).
[Various [IK systems have developed technologies for water conservation,
storage, and beneficial treatment]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Olokesusi,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib100)).
[For example, India\'s water tank systems are [part of the natural
hydrological cycle]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Lal,
2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib66)).
Many indigenous practices have been adopted by SK, which has claimed
originality ([Agrawal,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib3)).
Knowledge is passed down through generations and issues are solved
through practice, based on people-nature interactions ([Agrawal,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib3), [Diaw,
2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib35)).

[[When vaccines were not]{.mark} readily [available]{.mark} for an
ailment (global or local spread), [communities used]{.mark} their [IK to
create herbal remedies]{.mark} from various plants and
herbs]{.underline} ([Sadiku et al.,
2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib118)).
Although not approved by the World Health Organization as standard
solutions, [[countries like Madagascar and China]{.mark} still use IK
practices]{.underline} ([Basch,
1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib13), [Kugedera
et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib65)).
[[A vaccine was developed through the integration of SK and
IK.]{.underline}]{.mark} With technology, these plants and mixtures can
now be packaged and [[marketed globally]{.mark} as ointments,
antibiotics, pain relievers, and other pharmaceutical
products]{.underline} ([Omotayo et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib101)).
Given the current state of human civilization, many basic community
needs remain unmet, particularly in rural areas and overcrowded urban
centers. Investigating IK systems and SK can address various issues
effectively.

3.3. Case studies of integration

[Several [case studies demonstrate]{.mark} how [integrating IK and
SK]{.mark} might [improve environmental
conservation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A national Inuit
organization [[in Canada, Inuit]{.mark} Tapiriit Kanatami, has
[collaborated with scientists to track]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark} of
climate change in the Arctic]{.underline} ([Sawatzky et al.,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib121)).
[[Satellite data and]{.mark} the Inuit people\'s [traditional
understanding of animal behaviour and sea ice conditions]{.mark} have
been used to [produce more precise climate models]{.mark}]{.underline}
([Huntington et al.,
2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib57)).
In a similar vein, Indigenous groups [[in Brazil]{.mark} have worked
with experts studying conservation to oversee biodiversity in [the
Amazon rainforest]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Souza and Garcia,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib131), [Fernández-Llamazares
et al.,
2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib42)).
[[Successful conservation outcomes have]{.mark} [resulted from]{.mark}
these [partnerships;]{.mark} native lands typically have lower rates of
deforestation]{.underline} than protected areas that are not native
([Nepstad et al.,
2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib93)).

[[Crop rotation, intercropping, and agroforestry are]{.mark} examples of
[indigenous]{.mark} agricultural [techniques]{.mark} that have been
established over generations [to provide food security and sustainable
land usage]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, to irrigate crops in arid
regions, the Zuni people of the American Southwest have created complex
water management systems ([Turner and Clifton,
2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib143)).
These methods have shown to be [[resilient in the face of climatic
unpredictability]{.mark}, providing insightful guidance for contemporary
agricultural systems.]{.underline}

Agrochemical treatments, precision farming, genetically modified
organisms (GMOs), and [other scientific advances in agriculture
have]{.underline} dramatically raised agricultural production. [However,
the environmental effects of these technologies---such as soil erosion,
biodiversity loss, and heightened reliance on chemical inputs---have
frequently drawn criticism]{.underline} ([Holt-Giménez and Altieri,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib55)).

[The [Shona people of Zimbabwe and]{.mark} participatory plant [breeding
initiatives in India]{.mark} are [combin]{.mark}ing [traditional methods
of seed preservation with]{.mark} scientific [soil fertility
analyses]{.mark} to [increase]{.mark} crop [yields and maintain soil
health]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Cleveland and Soleri,
2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib30)).
These methods aim to maximize fertilizer management and boost yield
while maintaining soil health. Both initiatives aim to reintroduce
ancient rice varieties and promote environmentally friendly farming
techniques ([Nyathi and Dhlamini,
2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib96)).

Indigenous health systems use holistic treatment methods considering
environmental, physical, and spiritual factors ([WHO,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib151)).
[Traditional healers use medicinal herbs and spiritual practices to
treat a wide range of illnesses]{.underline} ([WHO,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib151)).
Traditional medicine remains the primary form of treatment for
indigenous peoples, particularly in rural areas ([WHO,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib151)).
Modern scientific healthcare includes evidence-based methods, new
pharmaceuticals, and technological advancements, but often prioritizes
symptoms over overall health ([WHO,
2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib151)).

[The [integration]{.mark} of scientific and indigenous knowledge [in
healthcare]{.mark} has [led to more]{.mark} [efficient]{.mark} and
culturally relevant [therapies]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Shisana et al.,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib123)).
In South Africa, [patients can now access both Western and traditional
medical systems]{.underline} through traditional healers\' regulation
([Shisana et al.,
2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib123)).

2.1. Literature search

[The [discussion adopts a]{.mark} desk-based [systematic review
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Aromataris and Pearson
(2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib9) define
a systematic review as an evaluation of the evidence on a clearly stated
issue that [uses an organised and explicit procedure [to identify,
select, evaluate, and synthesise primary research]{.mark}]{.underline},
as well as [[extract and analyse data from]{.mark} the [studies]{.mark}
examined.]{.underline} This is seen as a technique of laying out and
[summarising tangible evidence]{.underline} to highlight the research's
aims and shortcomings, as well as [[to inform policy assessment]{.mark}
and future research]{.underline} ([Khan et al.,
2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib62), [Patrick
and Khalema,
2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib105)).

[[A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple
databases]{.mark} using specific topics and specified
keywords]{.underline} \"Indigenous knowledge,\" OR \"Scientific
knowledge,\" OR \"Integration,\" "Cultural sensitivity," OR "Oral
histories," OR "Traditional knowledge," OR "Knowledge transmission," OR
"Community-based knowledge," OR "risk mitigation," and OR \"traditional
practices\" using Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Emerald,
Connected papers, and Elsevier library. The data sourced were then
managed using Mendeley. The justification for using Google Scholar is
that it [[leads to resources]{.mark} that were [not initially]{.mark}
considered, expanding the search to resources that were not
[indexed]{.mark} in other databases.]{.underline} It is important to
note that Mendeley was not used as a primary search engine**.** Rather,
Mendeley functioned as a reference as well as a search management tool
to store, organize, and annotate citations retrieved from the primary
databases. It also facilitated the de-duplication of search results and
collaborative review among co-authors. Mendeley also provides resources
that were not initially considered via the search option. However, it
does not always provide an accurate database result which is a
limitation in terms of the study duplication. While the structured
database search is replicable, we acknowledge that some relevant studies
were identified through manual methods (i.e. Mendeley search)**,** such
as backward citation tracking and recommendations from grey literature.
These supplementary strategies, while valuable for ensuring thematic
exposure, may reduce replicability due to their subjective nature.

[The literature synthesis focused on the integration of IK with SK, the
constraints faced with the integration of IK and SK, and the
success(es)]{.underline} of practised knowledge system integration were
also examined. The keywords searched in the databases for the initial
phases of title and abstract screening produced a wide variety of
results. Not only were these terms searched in the article\'s title, but
also the general topic, abstracts, and keywords.

The topic search words used are shown in [Table
1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#tbl0005).
Early searches encompassed a wide range of topics and word combinations.
The database searches were restricted to English-language literature
with no constraints on author or publication year. [[Peer-reviewed
publications]{.mark} such as research reports, policy notes (focal group
discussions included, community briefing included), [discussion/working
papers,]{.mark} [thesis and dissertations, books, conference papers, and
case studies were included]{.mark} in the initial article screening. The
inclusion criteria for this review required that studies focus on the
integration of Indigenous and scientific knowledge, include practical
applications, or [critically analyze the benefits and challenges of such
integration]{.mark}]{.underline}. Studies that did not meet these
criteria were excluded. A total of 951 articles were initially
identified through the keyword search. After title screening, 317
articles remained. Following abstract screening, this number was reduced
to 210. After a full-text review for relevance and alignment with the
inclusion criteria, [156 articles were selected for inclusion in the
final systematic review.]{.underline}

## Solvency

### Consultation Fails\-\--Solvency

#### U.S. has empirically made and broken "legally binding" treaties to assert control.

NGC '25 (Native Governance Center, native-led nonprofit dedicated to
assisting Native governance, recognized with the Minnesota Council of
Nonprofits Mission Award for Anti-Racism Initiative "Understanding &
Using Treaty Rights Guide" May 14 2025,
https://nativegov.org/resources/understanding-using-treaty-rights-guide/
//vo)

Treaties are nation-to-nation agreements between two sovereign powers
that must be upheld. In this context, we focus on treaty agreements of
Native nations and the United States of America. Treaties are legally
binding contracts between sovereign nations that establish those
nations' political and property relations. Treaties between Native
nations and the United States confirm each nation's rights and
privileges. Like the Constitution and Bill of Rights, treaties do not
expire with time. They have the same power now as when they were
originally created. Article Six of the United States Constitution holds
that treaties "are the supreme law of the land" inferring that when a
treaty is signed, it is a legal document that cannot be broken.
**[[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [used treaties]{.mark}
mainly [as a means to take land]{.mark} and legitimize the transactions
[from]{.mark} and with [Native nations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Others
were written to legitimize trade, military partnerships, and negotiate
peace with Native nations. Treaties were not entirely foreign to Native
nations prior to colonization as they had entered into treaties with
other Native nations regularly. [When treaties were made with the United
States, [Native nations often asked for]{.mark} specific
[provisions]{.mark} to be written into them. These provisions stipulated
certain material items in exchange for land]{.underline}. Many Native
nations also sought provisions that would retain a portion of land for
permanent homes for their citizens. Lands would then be reserved for
them and for their use leading to the term reservations which is used
today. [Today, **[we see]{.mark} that many of [these]{.mark} [treaties
have not been upheld]{.mark} or have been [broken on behalf of the
federal government]{.mark}**, and that has been done by design. Some of
**[these treaties were]{.mark} [signed for performative measures]{.mark}
[or intended to not]{.mark} be [follow]{.mark}ed [through]{.mark}**,
unbeknownst to the Native nations who agreed to them at the
time.]{.underline}

Indigenous representatives from around the world are convening in New
York this week for the 15th session of the UN Permanent Forum on
Indigenous Issues. The Forum is the UN's central coordinating and
advisory body on indigenous issues, and the annual sessions provide the
opportunity to take stock of issues affecting Indigenous Peoples around
the world. One such issue is large-scale development projects' ongoing
threats to indigenous control of lands and resources.

Before the bulldozers arrive in their communities, [[indigenous]{.mark}
men and women [must be informed and given the opportunity to decide
whether or not to allow]{.mark} such [a project to happen]{.mark}. Under
international human rights law, this right to "free, prior and informed
consent" ([FPIC) applies to all development projects]{.mark} that
directly affect indigenous communities' access to their lands and
resources.]{.underline}

Looking back on the history and development of FPIC, one can see clear
signs of progress, but also significant challenges to ensuring this
right is realized. Here are three key obstacles to overcome:

1\. [[FPIC]{.mark} is an internationally recognized human right, but
[isn't]{.mark} always [treated]{.mark} that way [at the national
level.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[While]{.mark} Indigenous Peoples' right to [FPIC is]{.mark} explicitly
[incorporated into]{.mark} both binding and non-binding [international
human rights laws, not all countries have adopted these
laws]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, the ILO Convention 169 on
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples is a legally binding treaty recognizing
indigenous rights to give consent, but it's only ratified by and thus
legally binding in 22 countries. Similarly, the legally binding
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) has been
ratified by 160 countries and has been authoritatively interpreted by
the UN Human Rights Committee to protect FPIC rights, but not all
countries embrace this interpretation. FPIC is also recognized in the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Voluntary
Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and
Forests (VGGTs), but [these "[soft laws" aren't technically legally
binding.]{.mark}]{.underline}

2\. [[Few countries have incorporated FPIC into their national
laws]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Thirty-six]{.mark} out of the 39 [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}
assessed on LandMark, a mapping platform of indigenous and community
lands and legal rights, [[do not have]{.mark} national [laws that
provide indigenous communities]{.mark} [with]{.mark} strong [legal
rights to FPIC]{.mark}. This is problematic given that [many of these
countries' laws grant]{.mark} governments broad legal [authority to take
indigenous land without]{.mark} consultation or
[consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. A forthcoming WRI working paper explores
how many countries' laws do not require governments to identify, inform
or consult affected landholders prior to acquiring land in a compulsory
manner, despite international standards calling for governments to do
so.

Of the countries assessed on LandMark, the Philippines, Colombia and
Peru are the only three that have incorporated strong FPIC rights for
indigenous communities in their national laws. Australia, Bolivia, South
Africa, South Sudan and Tanzania have also made some progress by
incorporating limited indigenous rights to give consent before their
lands are acquired by governments or other outsiders. If followed in
practice, these laws can protect indigenous communities from unwanted
encroachment and help them safeguard their lands and resources.

3\. FPIC is not always sensitive to gender issues.

[Even when recognized by domestic laws, [FPIC can have differing impacts
on men and women.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A recent study of FPIC implementation highlights how women are not
necessarily included in decision-making processes about land and
resources. Women in a community affected by a palm oil concession in
Desa Mekar Jaya, Indonesia, for example, stated that they had not heard
of FPIC, and it was mostly men who were involved in community
consultations related to the investment, despite the fact that women
work side-by-side with men in Indonesia's plantations[. The fact that
[women]{.mark} were [not consulted is]{.mark} particularly
[problematic]{.mark} given the risk of reproductive problems that can
arise from exposure to pesticides and other hazardous chemicals used by
the palm oil company]{.underline}. [Given [their role in]{.mark} rural
[communities]{.mark} and the impacts investments may have on them, [it
is important for women to be part of the FPIC
process.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Inter]{.mark}national standards---such as the VGGTs and the
International Finance Corporation Performance Standards (IFC), which
must be complied with by all investors financed by the IFC--- now
specifically recognize that FPIC must capture the views of both men and
women, but it's clear that there's still more work to do to achieve
gender equity in this area.

5. Challenges in integrating indigenous and scientific knowledge

[[IK and SK face]{.mark} significant [challenges in integration due
to]{.mark} their distinct [epistemological differences. SK is
factual]{.mark} and generic, [while IK is experiential and
holistic]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[Agrawal,
1995]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib2)).
[[Power disparities]{.mark} between indigenous communities and
scientific organizations can [hinder integration]{.mark}
efforts]{.underline}. Successful integration requires equitable
relationships that honor and cherish IK, as [[historically]{.mark}
suppressed [SK]{.mark} systems [have been
overlooked]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[Nakashima and Roué,
2002]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib91)).

[[Another]{.mark} difficulty [is the matter of i]{.mark}ntellectual
[p]{.mark}roperty [r]{.mark}ights. [Indigenous knowledge is owned
collectively, yet individual ownership and patenting are]{.mark}
typically [the focus of scientific study]{.mark}.]{.underline} Careful
negotiation is needed to preserve indigenous peoples\' intellectual
property while enabling the incorporation of their knowledge into
scientific frameworks ([[Grenier,
1998]{.underline}](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901125001352#bib48)).

#### Traditional Knowledge is overlooked by experts and won't be used.

**Gricius 24** \[Gabriella Gricius; April 29, 2024; July 6, 2025; PhD

For example, [Prior (2013) considered]{.underline} the [role of
polycentric governance around Persistent Organic Pollutants in the
Arctic]{.underline}, recognising the role of science, expertise,
epistemic communities, and traditional knowledge in this particular
issue area. [Byers (Reference Byers2017) specifically mentioned the role
of experts on technical issues including international law and geology
as essential for how states make extended continental shelf claims as
well as fisheries claims such as the Norwegian-Russian Fisheries
Commissi]{.underline}on. Mason & Soilkova (Reference Mason and
Soilkova2012) introduced new thinking about experts in the Arctic,
specifically using ethnographic work to consider liquified natural gas
production in the Arctic and energy development, drawing upon how

5.2.1.1. Procedural limitations

[[A key limitation to]{.underline}]{.mark} company- and [state-led
[consultation]{.mark} and consent [is procedural]{.mark}]{.underline},
with studies highlighting issues [around the goals, scope, and timing of
engagement. [Communities]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[perceive
consultations as]{.mark} bureaucratic [box-ticking
exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[117]{.underline}\], [[with
pre-determined agendas]{.mark} aimed at project approval [rather than
genuine dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accommodations are typically
limited to project terms and conditions, [[framing the question as "how"
rather than "whether" to execute a project]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[33]{.underline}\]. In terms of timing, [there is a perception that
[engagement: does not start early enough]{.mark} in the planning
process]{.underline} \[[99]{.underline},[118]{.underline}\]; [[leaves
insufficient time]{.mark} for preparation, discussion and addressing
concerns; [and is inadequate in engaging]{.mark} vulnerable and often
[excluded groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as youth
\[[119]{.underline}\] or women \[[89]{.underline}\]. In Greenland, for
example, "insufficient, late and overly narrow public participation are
major themes in the decision phase of the natural resource projects"
\[[120]{.underline}\]. A 2014 report by the Greenland NGO "Coalition for
Better Citizen Involvement" made recommendations for improving citizen
engagement \[[96]{.underline}\], [yet [procedural issues]{.mark}
continue to [undermine effective and meaningful communication, impacting
the ability]{.mark} of communities and stakeholders [to reach agreeable
decisions]{.mark} \[99\].]{.underline}

**[Legal ambiguity]{.underline}\-\--among Indigenous people over land
complicate consultation and consent**

5.2.1.2. Legal ambiguity and gaps

[[Another limitation]{.mark} refers to [legal ambiguity]{.mark} and gaps
[regarding land]{.mark} and property [rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Studies highlight [the issues of [overlapping and unresolved land claims
and legal interests across territories and]{.mark} among multiple
[owner]{.mark}s and land users]{.underline}
\[[89]{.underline},[121]{.underline}\]. [This [creates confusion
regarding the rights and responsibilities of
stakeholders]{.mark},]{.underline} contributing to disputes and
[[challenges]{.mark} in achieving [meaningful
consent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, there are
[[uncertainties]{.mark} or inadequacies in legal frameworks concerning
triggers [for consultation]{.mark} and consent.]{.underline} In Russia,
for example, "the federal regulation requires companies to hold public
hearings with local communities to discuss environmental impacts as part
of EIA \[environmental impact assessment\] at the stage of state project
approval. However, the federal regulation does not require a specific
consultation with Indigenous peoples" and there are no requirements for
Indigenous consent \[[78]{.underline}\].

**[Lack of trust]{.underline}\-\--undermines good faith negotiation**

**Loginova 25** \[Julia, Mia Landauer, Juha Joona, Ranjan Datta, and

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2025.103928\] //AChiong

5.2.1.3. [Weak relationships and lack of trust]{.underline}

Across the north, [[historical grievances,]{.mark} past experiences of
extractive industries and [ongoing colonial practices]{.mark} continue
to [strain relationships]{.mark} between Indigenous communities,
governments, and industry]{.underline} \[[112]{.underline}\]. However,
these tensions are not merely historical but are [rooted in the
persistent effects of coloniality, [including]{.mark} systemic
[marginalization and dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline} of Indigenous
lands \[[91]{.underline}\]. [[Centralised top-down structures]{.mark}
and processes [perpetuate mistrust]{.mark}, diminish self-confidence,
[and]{.mark} [undermine communities\' willingness to
engage]{.mark}]{.underline} with government- and company-led initiatives
\[[122]{.underline}\]. Building trust is strongly linked to effective
communication and transparency, and consultation and consent are
fundamentally about building long-lasting relations
\[[73]{.underline},[123]{.underline}\]. For example, Bowes-Lyon,
Richards \[[49]{.underline}\] explained that due to the lack of
communication over contamination issues, community members distrusted
the Nunavut government in the reclamation of the Nanisivik townsite as
part of the mine closure. [Furthermore, many [engagement activities are
perceived as]{.mark} [opportunistic and transactional]{.mark}, with
organisations [engaging]{.mark} communities [only when a need
arises]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[73]{.underline}\]. [[From the
community\'s point of view,]{.mark}]{.underline} this reinforces
colonial dynamics, as [[organisations]{.mark} frequently [fail
to]{.mark} acknowledge historical and ongoing injustices, or [invest
in]{.mark} creating [genuine relationships]{.mark}, which prioritize
Indigenous self-determination and agency in decision-making
processes.]{.underline}

**[Cultural disconnect]{.underline}\-\--over how to view the land lead
to unresolvable differences**

5.2.1.4. Cultural disconnect

[Cultural disconnect refers to epistemological differences]{.underline}
in worldviews, values, and decision-making cultures between Indigenous
communities and external stakeholders
\[[124]{.underline},[125]{.underline}\]. [[Issues arise from]{.mark} the
[inability]{.mark} of the engagement process [to recognise different
ways of]{.mark} gathering and understanding information, or [relating to
the environment.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Southern Sámi scholar
Fjellheim \[[33]{.underline}\] explains that
["[dialogues]{.underline}]{.mark}[" promoted as a prescription of good
governance [are underpinned by epistemic miscommunications, devaluing
Indigenous relations]{.mark} with the landscapes, knowledges, practices,
and interests.]{.underline} These differences [[lead to disagreements
over consultation goals]{.mark}, the nature of [consent, and]{.mark}
ideas of [justice.]{.mark}]{.underline} As [Table
3]{.underline} demonstrates, [[stakeholders]{.mark} have deeply rooted
[values]{.mark}, ideologies and epistemologies, [translat]{.mark}ing
[into plural rationalities]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[126]{.underline}\]
when it comes to decision-making. Importantly, a diversity of objectives
exists within these groups, as neither community, company, nor
government are homogeneous entities. A key challenge is how to reconcile
different perceptions of participatory mechanisms and FPIC procedures
among actors \[[90]{.underline},[104]{.underline}\].

**[Power asymmetry]{.underline}\-\--top down governmentally designed
consultation prevents equal and just consultation, discouraging
Indigenous participation**

5.2.1.5. Asymmetries in power, knowledge and control

The fifth [limitation is about [asymmetries in power, knowledge, and
control]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[95]{.underline},[102]{.underline},[110]{.underline},[122]{.underline}\].
These asymmetries [continue to [marginalise communities in engagement
processes]{.mark} dominated by top-down models of
governance]{.underline}
\[[95]{.underline},[111]{.underline},[124]{.underline}\]. [[Governments
and]{.mark} companies [design and control engagement
processes]{.mark},]{.underline} which are criticised for being too
formal and too technical \[[91]{.underline},[95]{.underline}\]. The
definition of "public consultation" in Greenland largely refers to
one-way flow of information sharing in a way proposed by project
proponents \[[127]{.underline},[128]{.underline}\]. As demonstrated by
Teschner and Holley \[[112]{.underline}\], participants in the
Environmental Impact Statement for the Donlin Gold project in Western
Alaska "felt [[patronized by]{.mark} a bureaucratic [process that
focused]{.mark} on fitting [stakeholder concerns]{.mark} [into technical
and scientific disciplines for analysis by outside experts".]{.mark}
[Communities]{.mark} feel powerless and [distrust external]{.mark}
[processes]{.mark} where the final decision is not in their
hands]{.underline} \[[129]{.underline}\].
[[Government]{.underline}]{.mark}- or corporate-[led [meetings are
not]{.mark} always [perceived as]{.mark} neutral, [inclusive,]{.mark}
equal, or deliberative]{.underline} \[[117]{.underline}\]. In some
cases, [[communities refused to attend]{.mark} consultation
[meetings]{.mark} due to "company\'s abandonment of protocol and
disrespectful behaviour",]{.underline} as was reported in the case of
Gallok, Jokkmokk in Sweden \[[107]{.underline}\]. Scobie and Rodgers
\[[122]{.underline}\] found that during consultations about a mining
project in northern Baffin Island, communities reported ["[inability to
express]{.mark} their [concerns" due to "insufficient education]{.mark}
and inaccessible [information"]{.mark} and "a general [discomfort
with]{.mark} the atmosphere in [meetings" which had]{.mark} ["formal and
intimidating nature".]{.mark}]{.underline} They were [concerned]{.mark}
that "[if they spoke up, [it may ruin job opportunities for
youth]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 237).

[These limitations]{.underline} of company- and state-led consultation
and consent [[marginalise Indigenous voices in decision-making]{.mark}
about resource development and environmental management in the Arctic
region, leading to and [reinforcing procedural
injustices.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### [Litany of factors]{.underline}\-\--Lack of trust, procedural limitations, asymmetries in power, and cultural disconnect all prove.

[[Limitations of]{.mark} company- and state-led [consultation]{.mark}
and consent]{.underline} is [a common thread in]{.underline} the
reviewed [literature]{.underline}. Table 2 summarises these limitations
by national context. We then present five limitations shared across all
circumpolar jurisdictions: [1) [procedural]{.mark} issues; 2) [legal
ambiguity]{.mark} and gaps; 3) weak relationships and [lack of
trust]{.mark}; 4) [cultural disconnect]{.mark}; and 5) [asymmetries in
power]{.mark}, knowledge, and control]{.underline}. [These
limitations]{.underline} are largely systemic in nature and [profoundly
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} the dynamics of [consultation and
[consent across]{.mark} the [circumpolar north]{.mark}]{.underline}.

5.2.1.1. Procedural limitations[. A key limitation to company- and
stateled consultation and consent is [procedural]{.mark}]{.underline},
with studies highlighting [[issues]{.mark} around the goals, scope, and
timing of engagement.]{.underline} [[Communities]{.mark} often
[perceive]{.mark} [consultations as bureaucratic]{.mark} box-ticking
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} \[117\], [[with pre-determined agendas
aimed at]{.mark} project [approval]{.mark} rather than genuine
dialogue]{.underline}. Accommodations are typically limited to project
terms and conditions, framing the question as "how" rather than
"whether" to execute a project \[33\]. [In terms of timing]{.underline},
there is a [[perception]{.mark} that engagement: does not start early
enough]{.underline} in the planning process \[99,118\]; leaves
insufficient time for preparation, discussion and addressing concerns;
[and is [inadequate in engaging vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} and
often excluded [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as youth \[119\] or
women \[89\]. In Greenland, for example, "insufficient, late and overly
narrow public participation are major themes in the decision phase of
the natural resource projects" \[120\]. A 2014 report by the Greenland
NGO "Coalition for Better Citizen Involvement" made recommendations for
improving citizen engagement \[96\], yet [procedural issues continue to
[undermine]{.mark} effective and [meaningful
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}, [impacting the ability]{.underline}
of communities and stakeholders [to reach agreeable
decisions]{.underline} \[99\].

5.2.1.2. Legal ambiguity and gaps. [Another limitation refers to [legal
ambiguity]{.mark} and gaps regarding land and property
rights]{.underline}. Studies highlight the [issues of overlapping and
unresolved land claims and legal interests]{.underline} across
territories and among multiple owners and land users \[89,121\]. [This
[creates confusion]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding the rights and
responsibilities of stakeholders, [[contributing to disputes]{.mark} and
challenges in achieving meaningful consent]{.underline}. In addition,
[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} uncertainties or [[inadequacies in
legal frameworks]{.mark} concerning triggers for consultation and
consent]{.underline}. In Russia, for example, "the federal regulation
requires companies to hold public hearings with local communities to
discuss environmental impacts as part of EIA \[environmental impact
assessment\] at the stage of state project approval. However, the
federal regulation does not require a specific consultation with
Indigenous peoples" and there are no requirements for Indigenous consent
\[78\].

5.2.1.3. Weak relationships and lack of trust. [Across the north,
[historical grievances]{.mark}, [past experiences of extractive
industries and]{.mark} ongoing [colonial practices]{.mark} continue to
[strain relationships between Indigenous]{.mark} [communities,
governments]{.mark}, and industry]{.underline} \[112\]. However, these
tensions are not merely historical but are [rooted in the persistent
effects of coloniality]{.underline}, including systemic marginalization
and dispossession of Indigenous lands \[91\]. Centralised top-down
structures and processes perpetuate mistrust, diminish self-confidence,
and [[undermine communities' willingness to engage with
government]{.mark}- and company-led [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[122\]. Building trust is strongly linked to effective communication
and transparency, and consultation and consent are fundamentally about
building long-lasting relations \[73,123\]. For example, Bowes-Lyon,
Richards \[49\] explained that due to the lack of communication over
contamination issues, community members distrusted the Nunavut
government in the reclamation of the Nanisivik townsite as part of the
mine closure. Furthermore, [many [engagement activities]{.mark} are
perceived as opportunistic and transactional]{.underline}, with
organisations engaging communities only when a need arises \[73\]. [From
the community's point of view, this [reinforces colonial
dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [organisations frequently [fail to
acknowledge]{.mark} historical and ongoing injustices, or invest
in]{.underline} creating genuine relationships, which prioritize
[Indigenous [self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} and agency in
decision-making processes.

5.2.1.4. Cultural disconnect. [[Cultural disconnect]{.underline}]{.mark}
refers to epistemological differences in worldviews, values, and
decision-making cultures between Indigenous communities and external
stakeholders \[124,125\]. [Issues [arise]{.mark} from the inability of
the engagement process to recognise different ways of gathering and
understanding information]{.underline}, or relating to the environment.
The Southern S´ ami scholar Fjellheim \[33\] explains that ["[dialogues"
promoted as]{.underline}]{.mark} [a prescription of [good]{.mark}
governance are [underpinned by]{.mark} epistemic
[miscommunications]{.mark}, [devaluing Indigenous
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} with the landscapes, knowledges,
practices, and interests. [These differences lead to disagreements over
consultation goals, the nature of consent, and ideas of
justice]{.underline}. As Table 3 demonstrates, stakeholders have deeply
rooted values, ideologies and epistemologies, translating into plural
rationalities \[126\] when it comes to decisionmaking. Importantly, a
diversity of objectives exists within these groups, as neither
community, company, nor government are homogeneous entities. A key
challenge is how to reconcile different perceptions of participatory
mechanisms and FPIC procedures among actors \[90,104\].

5.2.1.5. Asymmetries in power, knowledge and control. The fifth
limitation is about [[asymmetries in power]{.underline}]{.mark},
knowledge, and control \[95,102,110,122\]. These asymmetries [continue
to [marginalise communities]{.mark} in engagement processes [dominated
by top-down models]{.mark} of governance]{.underline} \[95,111,124\].
Governments and companies design and control engagement processes, which
are criticised for being too formal and too technical \[91,95\]. The
definition of "public consultation" in Greenland largely refers to
one-way flow of information sharing in a way proposed by project
proponents \[127,128\]. As demonstrated by Teschner and Holley \[112\],
[participants in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Donlin Gold
project in Western Alaska "felt patronized by a bureaucratic
process]{.underline} that focused on fitting stakeholder concerns into
technical and scientific disciplines for analysis by outside experts".
[[Communities feel powerless]{.underline}]{.mark} and distrust external
processes where the final decision is not in their hands \[129\].
[Government]{.underline}- or corporate-[led meetings are not always
perceived as neutral, inclusive, equal, or deliberative]{.underline}
\[117\]. In some cases, communities refused to attend consultation
meetings due to "company's abandonment of protocol and disrespectful

concerned that "if they spoke up, it may ruin job opportunities for
youth" (p. 237).

[These [limitations of]{.mark} company- and [state-led
consultation]{.mark} and consent [marginalise Indigenous voices]{.mark}
in decision-making]{.underline} about resource development and
environmental management in the Arctic region, leading to and
[[reinforcing procedural injustices.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Barriers to FPIC \-\-- Identification, Corruption, and Banks deck solvency 

**Baker 13** \[Shalanda Baker is a first vice provost for sustainability
and climate action at the University of Michigan, "WHY THE IFC'S FREE,
PRIOR, AND INFORMED CONSENT POLICY DOES NOT MATTER (YET) TO INDIGENOUS
COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS," 2/12/2013,
https://wilj.law.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1270/2014/04/Baker_print.pdf\]

[A [broad reading of FPIC]{.mark} would [give]{.mark} indigenous
[communities]{.mark} full [veto power]{.mark} over projects.99
[This]{.mark} [view is]{.mark} currently [not supported]{.mark} by the
IFC]{.underline},100 but such an interpretation could provide real
benefits for indigenous communities, not least of which is the right to
selfdetermination. [Putting aside [questions of how developers would
identify]{.mark} the [appropriate voices]{.mark} in the community in
order [to]{.mark} [obtain]{.mark} their [consent or]{.mark} the
[potential for widespread corruption and co-opting of community
leaders,]{.mark}]{.underline} veto power could greatly empower
indigenous peoples affected by development projects. Despite this
potential, [the [veto power]{.mark} interpretation may yet [be
unrealistic]{.mark} given the timelines involved in large-scale project
development.]{.underline}

For example[, the [FPIC]{.mark} requirement [would not be triggered
until]{.mark} the [IFC or a bank bound by FPIC]{.mark} vis-à-vis the
Equator Principles [has agreed to finance a project]{.mark}. [By the
time]{.mark} the [financing]{.mark} of a project [is]{.mark}
[imminent]{.mark}, project [developers have already invested significant
resources]{.mark} in the project, including environmental assessments,
profit modeling, and engagement of the relevant contractors to build the
project]{.underline}.101 Moreover, [the Private Investment Community
Narrative that frames [indigenous]{.mark} [participation]{.mark} as a
risk-mitigation tool [leaves little room for project cancellation. It
is]{.mark} therefore [unlikely that project developers or banks
would]{.mark} ever [endorse the veto interpretation]{.mark}, especially
without a mechanism in place to compensate the developer for its sunk
costs.]{.underline}

I now turn to the more likely interpretation of FPIC--- consultation
"plus."

#### Isolation, internal participation, and overlap make FPIC wholly ineffective

**McCulloch 21** \[Emily McCulloch; University of Montana -- Public Land
Resource Review, "Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: A Struggling
International Principle," 06/2021,
https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&context=plrlr\]

[[Fundamental issues remain with implementing]{.mark} the [FPIC]{.mark}
including isolation, internal participation, and overlap]{.underline}.62
[[Isolation is detrimental]{.mark} to the FPIC's goals [because]{.mark}
some indigenous [populations desire to live
secluded]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}63 Because of their isolation,
[[public participation and consultation are
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}.64 Scholars argue the "desire to be left
alone" shows they do not give consent to projects because of their
intention to secure their land from the outside communities.65

This reluctance and mistrust lend itself to difficulties when
implementing the FPIC. [[Another]{.mark} issue with the FPIC
implementation [is internal participation]{.mark}]{.underline}.66 Some
[[indigenous groups contain marginalized]{.mark} [populations]{.mark}
like women and children, [but do not allow all community members to
participate]{.mark}---[a concept the FPIC
requires]{.mark}]{.underline}.67 For example, in some indigenous groups,
women and children are not consulted on issues that affect the internal
community.68 [Because [overall participation]{.mark} by affected
indigenous groups [is a key part]{.mark} of the FPIC implementation,
[participation]{.mark} from "illiberal" communities [is
challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}.69

[[A third]{.mark} major [issue]{.mark} with implementation [is overlap
between]{.mark} other indig[enous communities or
entities]{.mark}]{.underline}.70 A "[[dichotomized]{.mark}"
[view]{.mark} of indigenous groups [leads to "arbitrarily fixating
indigenous peoples' consensus,]{.mark} while [disregarding]{.mark} the
multiple and [fragmented nature of the member subject]{.mark}
positions."71 By recognizing the [cultural overlaps and differing
interests]{.mark} among groups, developers face [challenges]{.mark} to
achieve [one common plan and]{.mark} gain all [groups'
consent]{.mark}.]{.underline}72

### Consultation Fails --- Land Rights

#### [Consultation fails]{.underline} --- it doesn't grant the [right to refuse]{.underline} external access to Indigenous land.

**Townsend \'20** \[Leo Townsend; British Academy Newton Fellow at the
University of Reading, PhD at the Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature
in Oslo; \"Consultation, Consent, and the Silencing of Indigenous
Communities\"; Wiley Online Library; May 25, 2020;
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/japp.12438\] // K Nahm

[The **right to [consultation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, discussed in the
previous two case studies, [[is a]{.mark} **procedural
[participatory]{.mark}** [**right**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [[requires
decision-makers to **follow** certain procedures]{.underline}]{.mark}
([to consult with communities]{.underline}) [[and]{.mark} to [take
certain information into account]{.mark} in decision-making]{.underline}
(submissions and statements made by those communities in the course of
the consultation process). [It is [not a right that determines **the
outcomes** of the decision-making process]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[it
does not guarantee]{.mark} communities [continued occupation of]{.mark}
their [territories nor]{.mark}]{.underline} does it grant them **[[the
right to refuse]{.underline}]{.mark}** mining companies [[access to
their land]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, many see [the right to
consultation]{.underline} as [**too weak** to meaningfully protect
Indigenous communities]{.underline}, and as a result [Indigenous rights
activists have argued that the state should not simply consult but also
obtain the free, prior and informed consent]{.underline} (FPIC) of the
community before making decisions that will impact its land and
livelihood. As a consequence of these efforts, the right to FPIC has now
been recognized in international legal texts and by the Inter-American
Court of Human Rights.

### Consultation Fails --- Agency Circumvention

#### [Agency discretion]{.underline} circumvents consultation.

[Agency discretion refers to the power of a government agency to decide
**whether and** how to implement laws and regulations]{.underline}.
According to California law, Tribes possess the right to consult when
proposed development projects threaten Tribal cultural resources. But
[in practice, [agencies exercise **wide latitude** to decide what
consultation entails]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [what merits
consideration]{.underline}]{.mark} as a Tribal cultural resource, [[what
counts as sufficient]{.mark} mitigation]{.underline} of anticipated
impacts, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[what projects are
exempt]{.underline}]{.mark} from the requirement to consult. If a
resource is not already listed on the California Register of Historical
Resources (and many are not for reasons that we explain in the section
below on knowledge gaps), the onus is on Tribes to convince agency
counterparts of the merits of their claim: "You have to get a lead
agency for a project doing CEQA to concur the site was actually a site"
(TR 1).4 Sharing a similar sentiment, an agency representative observed:
"When I read AB 52, the fact is that the lead agency can listen to a
Tribe through a consultation process and say, 'We disagree. We're going
forward.' That is bizarre" (AR 2). When an agency, in their discretion,
determines that the landscape feature in question does not merit
consideration as a Tribal cultural resource or that impacts do not
exceed certain "thresholds of significance" or that removal or
compensation is a sufficient mitigation measure, [[Tribes that disagree
have **little recourse** but to sue]{.mark} in court, [which is]{.mark}
very [costly]{.mark}, [time-consuming]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} historically
has [not led to favorable outcomes]{.mark} for Tribes]{.underline}.
Further upstream, [[agencies can]{.mark} also [exercise]{.mark} their
[discretion by creating]{.mark} a permit [process that circumvents
consultation or delays it to]{.mark} the point that consultation would
[be **meaningless**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of cannabis, some
counties created a regulatory category of "interim" or "provisional
permit" or "early activation," which allowed cannabis operators to
continue cultivation without completing the permit process.5 Under these
temporary permits, operators sometimes cultivated cannabis for years
without undergoing CEQA review (AR 2). Since AB 52 is part of CEQA,
these projects would not be subject to Tribal consultation: "We were
getting notifications for projects and going out there and things had
already started. They had already dug their utility lines or their
security shack or water lines...And so it was just a free for all,
everybody was getting these early activations" (TR 2). Similarly, some
counties and most cities used "ministerial approvals" for cannabis, that
is, expedited review at the administrative level based on whether a
project conforms to applicable building and zoning code requirements.
For example, a small project on private property that does not meet a
threshold level of ground disturbance may not require additional review.
Like provisional licenses, ministerial permits bypass CEQA and deny
Tribes the opportunity to consult under AB 52. The State intervened in
some cases that they found too hasty (such as in Inyo County), yet many
projects were allowed or had already begun on which Tribes would have
liked to consult. In short, making consultation a part of other statutes
rather than a standalone law, for example subsuming AB 52 under CEQA,
creates legislative loopholes and ultimately limits the applicability of
cultural resource laws, further strengthening agencies' discretionary
authority to determine whether and how these laws apply.6

#### Agencies have [no incentive]{.underline} for complying --- weak enforcement of agreements means consultation goes [nowhere]{.underline}.

[[Weak enforcement]{.mark} mechanisms]{.underline} tend to
[[have]{.underline}]{.mark} the same effect as [legislative [loopholes
and limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} placed on the scope of policies,
all of [[which remove incentives for upholding]{.mark} cultural
[resource laws]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one Tribal representative
explained, "It's [[almost meaningless to have]{.mark} permit [conditions
**if no one is checking to see if they are
followed**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (TR 3). A common refrain among cultural
resource practitioners is that these [laws "lack teeth,"]{.underline}
that is, [there are [few consequences for agencies that fail to
comply]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, one of the main regulatory
authorities, the State Water Resources Control Board, noted in an
interview that it uses a complaint-based system, which is relatively
strong on inspections prior to issuing permits and light on compliance
checks after the fact (AR 3). A lack of enforcement renders cultural
resource laws non-binding, which gives agencies wide latitude to apply
the law as they see fit. A Tribal Chair said: "I think AB 52 has some
good bones to it. The premise and the structure of it are good. It's
just follow-through from agencies. I don't know how you change the
mentality of, well, this is where...it says I need to check that box (TR
4).

[[Weak enforcement has downstream effects on]{.mark} other aspects of
project approvals and [development]{.mark}]{.underline}. Several
interviewees described scenarios in which
[[developers]{.underline}]{.mark} were able to [[remain vague
about]{.mark} project start [dates or did not keep]{.mark} their
[agreement]{.mark} to have cultural monitors onsite at the start of
work]{.underline}: "Oftentimes they're grading and someone will find
out, like 'Oh, they're grading over there. Aren't we supposed to have a
monitor?' I'm like, 'Yeah.' And then we have to bark up a bunch of trees
to get people to stop... And often the first cut is one of the most
important times to be there. You want to see what's right under the
surface" (TR 5). [[When they get caught]{.underline}]{.mark}," this
interviewee continued, "**[[all they get is a hand
slap]{.underline}]{.mark}**...They can get away with it. They go and
grade everything and when we find out, there are no repercussions for
them -- not really." The Tribal Chair of a [federally unrecognized
Tribe]{.underline} interpreted this lack of enforcement as a loophole in
the law: "AB 52 says that they need to notify. But they don't
necessarily have to work with us. We [don't have]{.underline} all that
[enforcement that federally recognized Tribes do]{.underline}, so that
happens on occasion -- on a lot of occasions" (TR 6).

### Consultation Fails -- Say No: Oil 

**[Say no]{.underline}\-\--agreement depends on [perception]{.underline}

will immediately [reject]{.underline} the CP on face**

[[Seven Indigenous nations]{.mark} have [withdrawn from discussions
over]{.mark} an [oil and gas liquids]{.mark} pipeline [in
Michigan]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} citing federal agencies' failure
to adequately engage with tribal governments during the process.

The move is expected to trigger lawsuits the tribes hope will block the
controversial Line 5 project, a 645-mile pipeline that carries over
half-a-million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids per day and
runs between the United States and Canada. Enbridge, the company behind
Line 5, has proposed a tunnel under the Great Lakes in order to replace
a section of the 72-year-old pipeline.

[The tribal nations have been [involved]{.mark} with the permitting
process [since 2020]{.mark}, when]{.underline} Enbridge applied to build
the underground tunnel for the pipeline, [[but have grown]{.mark}
increasingly [dissatisfied with negotiations]{.mark} they say [ignored
tribal expertise, input, and concerns, and undermined treaty
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On March 20, tribes say the Army Corps of Engineers, [[the agency
assessing]{.mark} the project and its [environmental impacts, informed
them]{.mark} that [it would]{.mark} likely soon [grant]{.mark} Enbridge
[a fast-tracked permit]{.mark} for the tunnel]{.underline} under
President Donald Trump's energy emergency declaration, [which
effectively created a new class of permit [to boost energy
supplies.]{.mark} That announcement, [the tribes say, prompted the
withdrawal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[Tribal Nations are no longer willing]{.mark} to expend their time and
resources]{.underline} as Cooperating Agencies just so [[their
participation]{.mark} may be [used by the corps to lend credibility to a

document,"]{.underline} [[they wrote]{.mark} in a March 21 letter [to

thousands of years of cultural traditions and ways of knowing. In my

elevations due to warming temperatures and two decades of drought.

#### Consultation is [impossible]{.underline}. And takes [too long]{.underline}.

Aside from the [[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [public meeting

adequate time]{.mark}]{.underline} for [people to [digest

[Isukasia mining]{.underline} information meetings also [[failed to be

concerned. It is [[not enough]{.mark} for a company to provide the
[information]{.mark}]{.underline} that it thinks is [most important or

[listen carefully to questions]{.underline} and have [available
experts]{.underline} who can answer different types of questions.
Geologists cannot answer questions about impacts of the project on
hunting, job opportu­ nities, or the needs of an immigrant workforce,
etc. It is unlikely that a developer can anticipate every question that
will arise; but it can [[anticipate broadly]{.mark} the [range]{.mark}
of [topics]{.mark} and ensure that its panels do not include only
natural scientists]{.underline} and [public relations]{.underline}
personnel. It is likely that it will be [necessary to include people
familiar]{.underline} with the history of the area and others who
understand its [social importance]{.underline}, including in some cases
spiritual values.

### Deficit\-\--Certainty

#### Consultation [doesn't guarantee]{.underline} that indigenous groups will say yes

Indigenous communities, "Consultation doesn't always equal consent,"

[There is a [big difference between consultation and
consent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Consultation]{.mark} in the United States [doesn't have to include
consent]{.mark}]{.underline} but tribal nations have made great strides
in this area. Although not required, it's often a goal for the [[federal
government to reach a consensus]{.mark} or agreement with a tribal
nation. [Historically]{.mark}, this [hasn't always been the
case.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 1948, the [[federal government approved]{.mark} the [Garrison
Dam]{.mark} that flooded 152,000 acres of Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara
land in North Dakota, [despite objections from the
tribe]{.mark}]{.underline}. It forced the relocation of 325 families
from the tribe.

Last year, a judge ruled against Arizona-based tribes, Tohono O'odham
Nation and San Carlos Apache Tribe, in a suit that was challenging the
construction of the SunZia transmission line in southern Arizona's San
Pedro Valley. The line passes through an area that holds historic,
cultural and spiritual significance for the nations. The two tribes have
been fighting its construction for years, advocating that it be built
alongside land that has already been developed. It crosses "one of the
most intact cultural landscapes in the Southwest," a 2024 lawsuit by the
Tohono O'odham Nation stated. The project was a cornerstone of former
President Joe Biden's green energy agenda.

"The SunZia Transmission Project will accelerate our nation's transition
to a clean energy economy by unlocking renewable resources, creating
jobs, lowering costs, and boosting local economies," Deb Haaland, former
Interior Secretary, said in a 2023 press release. "Through historic
investments from President Biden's Investing in America agenda, the
Interior Department is helping build modern, resilient climate
infrastructure that protects our communities from the worsening impacts
of climate change."

The case was appealed to the Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
The panel of judges heard oral arguments on March 26. An opinion has yet
to be released.

[[Adopting the principles of]{.mark} free, prior and informed
[consent]{.mark} could help to alleviate legal issues]{.underline} like
this. The federal government and companies could avoid lengthy and
costly legal battles by engaging in this process.

### FPIC Fails --- False Hope

#### FPIC provides indigenous communities with false hope -- but no real power -- makes it impossible to solve for self determination

Resource Review, "Free, Prior, and Informed Consent: A Struggling
International Principle," 06/2021,
https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&context=plrlr\]

Finally[, it remains [unclear if the "consent" part of the FPIC includes
veto power]{.mark}.]{.underline}79 [[Without veto]{.mark} power, the
[FPIC loses strength]{.mark} because [projects can continue to move
forward]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of now, the international community
recognizes [[tribal consultation]{.mark} as the customary
norm]{.underline}.80 For instance, the United States has a
"long-standing executive branch policy to incorporate special \[tribal\]
status into regulatory processes," [but it [does not include tribal veto
power]{.mark} on project]{.underline}s.81 Similarly, Canada has a duty
to consult with indigenous communities during the Environmental Impact
Assessment phase which includes "good-faith consultation" and
willingness to make changes based on information obtained during
assessments.82 Canada's policy, however, does not include tribal
consultation as determinative of whether the project moves forward, even
if indigenous communities are opposed. 83 Unfortunately, as shown in
Canada's and the United States' policies, [[the question of
whether]{.mark} nation [states need to obtain consent from]{.mark}
indigenous [communities is]{.mark} usually [answered in the
negative]{.mark} because governments can weigh economic benefit to
regulate resources for all citizens, not just its indigenous
groups.]{.underline}

Social Movements and Legislation

[[Throughout the Arctic,]{.mark} Indigenous and local [communities have
had their right to self-determination continually thwarted and
challenged]{.mark} by a myriad of industries and developmental projects
in the region.]{.underline} [The sentiment behind ["Green
Colonialism,"]{.mark} the [purposeful sacrificing of Indigenous land
in]{.mark} the [name of environmental goals]{.mark}, has [led to the
creation of]{.mark} domestic and international [agreements with the aim
of protecting and preserving Indigenous land, culture and
identity.]{.mark} Development of land claim settlements, such as the
Alaska Native Land Claim Settlement in 1971, the largest Indigenous land
settlement in US history, have positively contributed to Impact and
Benefit Agreements between Indigenous peoples and mines in Alaska and
elsewhere.]{.underline}

[Whilst [the mining sector]{.mark} is an industry [known to have
a]{.mark} direct [impact on Indigenous communities in the
Arctic,]{.mark} the impacts of development in the Arctic come from a
wider array of industries [including but not limited to]{.mark} resource
[extraction, exploitation]{.mark} of other natural resources (hunting,
fishing), [tourism, transport and]{.mark} energy
[infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline} These impacts have led to the
development of a variety of frameworks and legislation which have been
previously affected by lack of recognition of the rights of Indigenous
peoples to land, mineral and natural resources.

One example of this is The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which was adopted in 2007 and establishes a
universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity and
wellbeing of Indigenous Peoples worldwide (United Nations, 2015). UNDRIP
stipulates that Indigenous Peoples are not solely stakeholders in
potential extractive projects but instead, they are right holders. The
ratification of UNDRIP led to change throughout the Arctic. For example,
in Greenland, the 30 year old "Greenland Home Rule Arrangement" was
replaced in 2009 by the Act on Greenland Self Government. This provided
the legal basis for Greenland gaining authority, previously held by
Denmark, in matters exclusively related to Greenlandic domestic affairs
and natural resources (International Energy Agency, 2023). Furthermore,
in 2011, the Government of Sweden added a reform to the Constitution,
stipulating that the Government shall encourage opportunities for the
Sámi people and for other ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities in
Sweden to preserve and develop their own culture and community life
(Human Rights Council Report, 2014).

[An integral part of UNDRIP is the notion of Free, Prior and Informed
Consent ([FPIC]{.mark}) which [stipulates]{.mark} that [states must have
obtained free, prior and informed consent before adopting and
implementing]{.mark} legislative or administrative [measures which
impact Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}. The [recognition and
promotion]{.mark} of the Free Prior Informed Consent is an important
principle of engaging with Indigenous peoples [during mining
projects]{.mark} and [has become]{.mark} very [important]{.mark}
worldwide.]{.underline} The International Finance Corporation, a member
of the World Bank, has created eight performance standards which aim to
provide guidance on how to avoid, mitigate and manage risks so that
business is conducted in a sustainable way (International Finance
Corporation, 2012a). [These standards recognise that Indigenous Peoples
may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts associated with
project development, including the loss of identity, culture, and
natural resource-based livelihoods (International Finance Corporation,
2012b). The [implementation of FPIC has also been seen in the mining
industry.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2013, the International Council on
Mining and Metals (ICMM) published a position statement on the rights of
Indigenous peoples incorporating FPIC principles and promoting
constructive relationships between mining companies and Indigenous
peoples. ICMM noted the increase in acknowledgement and application of
FPIC in the mining industry since the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable
Development (MMSD) initiative was completed, 12 years ago.

[In addition to the protections provided by UNDRIP and FPIC, the
International Labour Organisation Convention formed the Indigenous and
Tribals Peoples Convention in 1989, which is often referred to as ILO
No. 169, recognising Indigenous Peoples' right to self-determination and
paving the way for the creation and implementation of
UNDRIP.]{.underline} A previous ILO convention, No. 107 formed in 1957,
was created in the wake of WW2 amidst rising concern regarding the
oppression and discrimination of Indigenous Peoples. Norway declined to
sign this convention in 1958, noting that the provisions included did
not apply to the Sámi (Ravna, 2020) but became the first to ratify ILO
No. 169 in 1989. As one of the signatory states, Norway is obliged to
recognise Sámi self-determination and within this is the restitution of
Sámi culture and heritage. An example of this is the Bååstede project
which has seen around 1,600 Sámi cultural heritage artefacts from the
Norwegian Folk Museum and the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, being
returned to six Sámi museum siidas. Furthermore, the National Archives
of Norway handed over the Lapp Codicil which is an addendum to the
Stromstad Treaty of 1751 which defined the Norwegian-Swedish border, to
the Sámi Archives, located in Kautokeino in 2021. This addendum to the
border treaty contains provisions on the right of reindeer-herding
between the Swedish and Norwegian border (The Library of Congress,
2021).

**S/quo solves -- consultative measures with Natives are already being
put forward in mining**

**US Department of Indian Affairs 23** \[Bureau of Indian Affairs, a
United States federal agency within the Department of the Interior;
"National Tribal Critical Minerals Initiative,"
https://www.bia.gov/service/tribal-consultations/national-tribal-critical-minerals-initiative#:\~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20this%20initiative,development%20or%20other%20benefits%20sharing.\]//AChiong

In February 2021, President Biden announced an Executive Order on
securing America's supply chains - including critical minerals - to
further our nation's national security and climate goals including a
transition net zero emissions economy by 2050. Critical minerals are the
building blocks of this energy transition and the Biden-Harris
Administration (the "Administration") is pursuing a whole-of-government
approach to increase the reliability of the critical minerals supply
chain, including strengthening recycling, researching critical minerals
replacements, assessing standards, pursuing international engagements,
and increasing responsible domestic mining.

[[The Administration acknowledges]{.mark} the [problematic and damaging
history between extractive industries and Tribal communities]{.mark},
and the potential impact of new mining to significantly impact Tribal
lands, people and resources.]{.underline} Early, meaningful, and ongoing
consultation and engagement with Tribal governments is imperative as the
US government pursues development of a responsible, critical minerals
supply chain. Furthermore, [[Tribes should]{.mark} be given the
opportunity to [equitably share]{.mark} in the economic development
[benefits]{.mark} of mineral development.]{.underline}

First and foremost, the Administration is striving to not repeat the
sins of the past with extractive industry. As part of this effort, the
Administration's Department of the Interior-led Interagency Working
Group (IWG) on Mining Laws, Regulations, and Permitting held four Tribal
consultations and other Tribal listening sessions to receive Tribal
input on improving mining on public lands. In September 2023, the IWG
published the Recommendations to Improve Mining on Public Lands report
with dozens of recommendations for improving Tribal consultation and
engagement, protection of Tribal resources, and sharing of economic
benefits when it comes to mining. Note, the report's recommendations may
also support improved practices for projects not on public lands.

[In response to several Tribal inquiries about the Administration's
actions on critical minerals, [the]{.mark} White House Council on Native
American Affairs [(WHCNAA) created a Critical Minerals Working
Group.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The WHCNAA Critical Minerals Working Group is seeking your input on the
September 2023 Recommendations to Improve Mining on Public Lands report.
We are also seeking your feedback to prioritize and implement
recommendations from the report that will benefit Tribes.

This Working Group also created a Draft National Tribal Critical
Minerals Initiative to improve Tribal consultation and engagement in
domestic critical minerals supply chain. [[The purpose]{.mark} of this
initiative [is to ensure Tribal interests are]{.mark} meaningfully
considered early and often [in the pursuit of]{.mark} a domestic
[critical minerals]{.mark} supply chain, [including
environmental]{.mark} and human [health protection,]{.mark} Tribal [and
cultural]{.mark} resources [protection,]{.mark} and economic development
or other benefits sharing.]{.underline} We are also seeking your
feedback on the Draft National Tribal Critical Minerals Initiative.

### AT: Net-Benefit\-\--Self-D\-\--Impact Turn

#### FPIC is [divorced]{.underline} from self-determination\-\--if Indigenous peoples can [only]{.underline} exercise FPIC **within frameworks that define [who they are, what their rights mean, and how they can claim them]{.underline},** then they can [never]{.underline} truly accomplish [sovereignty nor self-determination]{.underline}.

Stephen **Young 19** \[11/18/2019; Stephen Young has a PhD called "The
Legal Performativity of Indigenous Peoples Free, Prior and Informed
Consent,"; "Indigenous Peoples, Consent and Rights: Troubling
Subjects,";

[The main problem that many scholars identify]{.underline} - and they
are not wrong in doing so - [is that [even if UNDRIP]{.mark} or other
instruments [recognize that Indigenous peoples should]{.mark} have the
ability to [determine what states can]{.mark} and cannot [do to
them]{.mark}, [states and]{.mark} non-indigenous [industry actors
hold]{.mark} interests that are generally [misaligned]{.mark} with the
full or promising legal [recognition of FPIC]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not
only are state and industry [interests potentially misaligned with the
recognition of FPIC, one scholar has recently cautioned that \'\[the
emerging risk for indigenous peoples today is that [FPIC becomes a
corporate or state construct]{.mark}, one again [divorced from self
determination and sovereignty rights]{.mark}, thereby facilitating
unfettered access to resources in indigenous territories?!]{.underline}
[As such, it appears pressing that FPIC is defined and advocated for in
a way that allows Indigenous peoples to have the self-determination to
control their futures.]{.underline}16

This brief discussion reveals how [quickly one can become engaged in
dissecting, rearticulating and advocating for FPIC so that Indigenous
peoples can use it to control what affects them without considering the
subject-status of Indigenous peoples or how defining FPIC might
influence that subject. If a scholar were to define it, would that mean
that Indigenous peoples who are supposed to claim it cannot? Would the
definition of FPIC impose a non-consensual understanding of what is
consent and FPIC on those who are presumed to be Indigenous
peoples?]{.underline}

Kathy Bowrey is right to acknowledge that '[what legal institutions are
and how they function remain very much under-theorized in much of the
literature about Indigenous peoples and the law'.]{.underline}17 Despite
an abundance of literature on Indi-genous peoples and international law,
and partly as an effect of that literature's disciplinary focus and its
disciplinary effects, [the untroubled nature of the sub-jectivity that
claims FPIC remains undertheorized.]{.underline} 18 That, in itself, is
troubling, which means that it is dangerous, not that it is necessarily
bad.19

This book takes Bowrey's concern seriously. It argues that [scholars,
advocates and others who participate in international legal discourse
have not analyzed how they use the discourse of international human
rights law to produce the subjects who are supposed to claim
FPIC.]{.underline} 20 To explain how scholars and others have
underestimated the effects of international legal discourse, I use a
legal performative methodology to problematize or trouble the
subject-status of those who claim Indigenous peoples' rights and the
role of scholars, institutions, NGOs and others in producing that
subject-status. As more fully explained in Chapter 1, I borrow primarily
from Judith Butler and Michel Foucault, as well as a few others, to the-
orize how the international legal discourses produced and produces
rights and the subjects who are supposed to claim them. [Although many
[self-identifying Indi-genous peoples are]{.mark} well [aware of human
rights limitations and power disparities]{.mark},]{.underline} 21 [this
methodology enriches the analysis of power by squarely addressing the
[lim-itations of international human rights law]{.mark} as well as the
ways in which scholars and others who use discourses of power and law
produce intuitively appealing, alluring [and]{.mark} yet [problematic
approaches to rights claiming.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although Butler addresses Indigenous peoples only in a limited context,
22 her performative approach to gender assists in understanding the
demands of the law placed on subjects. 23 As articulated here, [a
performative method pro- vides a means of theorizing, and hence viewing
the performative enactment, or the subjectification, to international
legal discourse as identifiable Indigenous peoples that occurs through
invoking FPIC.]{.underline} We will see that [in order to be
identifiable as a representative of Indigenous peoples for the purposes
of claiming FPIC, [individuals and communities insert
themselves]{.mark}, as others insert them, [into international legal
discourse, one]{.mark} that is [produced and reproduced by scholars,
advocates, self-identifying Indigenous peoples and
others.]{.mark}]{.underline} This often occurs when rights claimants
assert that they are traditional and essential Indigenous peoples. To do
so does not mean separating oneself from the coercion of states,
industry, NGOs or others. Rather, it requires constructing oneself as a
subject of international legal discourse in dependence upon others,
those coercive forces and disciplinary powers so that others can
identify one as a bearer of human rights. [This methodology evaluates
how [individuals and com- munities become subjects]{.mark} who bear
those rights [to reveal oppressive, agentic and potentially subversive
uses of those rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To be seen as bearing Indigenous peoples' human rights is to
performatively act in a way that is identifiable to international legal
discourse participants. That does not mean it is false or fake, nor that
it is only negative or oppressive. It does mean that becoming Indigenous
peoples is not merely or solely an individual choice or decision.
Performatively enacting a legal subjectivity is contingent upon others
legitimating and confirming the applicability of international legal
discourse to that situation. Accordingly, one must also consider how
scholars, advocates and others -- who might be called 'elites' or
'experts'24 -- use rights, as well as consider how those who claim human
rights performatively enact sub-jectivities of Indigenous peoples within
international legal discourse. [Examining high profile [situations
involving FPIC and self-determination]{.mark} claims [shows]{.mark} that
rights claiming can be [both oppressive and agentic at the same
time]{.mark}, and, fur-ther, that the possibility of insurrectionary
potential resides in Indigenous peo-ples claiming FPIC and
self-determination. However, [it is troubling that anyone presupposes
that there are subjects called 'Indigenous peoples' who possess]{.mark}
objects called ['human rights']{.mark} that pre-exist international
legal discourse on Indigenous peoples and human rights. In short, the
legal performative method provides a conceptual framework for rethinking
the promise and power of Indi-genous peoples' rights, and by extension
human rights law. This has con- sequences in terms of language and
terminology, but it also has effects that are not obvious to me or
anyone else.]{.underline}

The first consequence is a terminological issue, which begins to
highlight the extent and depth of these troubles. [[We colloquially
deploy the term 'Indigen-ous peoples' as a blanket term to refer to all
tribal, native, Aboriginal, First Nations, nomadic, American Indian,
historically land-connected subsistence farmers, or other
peoples.]{.mark}]{.underline} 25 [But, [for the purposes of claiming
human rights, Indigenous peoples are and must be subjects of
international legal discourse.]{.mark} The term ['Indigenous
peoples']{.mark} can be -- and often is -- deployed in a lay sense, as a
naturalized signifier, which [is a term of a 'universalizing and
neutralizing rhetoric' of law]{.mark}.]{.underline} 26 [However, this
legal performative methodology evaluates how international legal
discourse 'hides' that Indigenous peoples are its sub- jects, because
legal discourse conceals its own effects so that its subjects appear
natural.]{.underline}

Juridical power inevitably 'produces' what it claims merely to
represent; hence, politics must be concerned with this dual function of
power: the jur-idical and the productive. In effect, the law produces
and then conceals the notion of 'a subject before the law' in order to
invoke that discursive forma-tion as a naturalized foundational premise
that subsequently legitimates that law's own regulatory hegemony.27

[The legal performative method applied here is concerned with dual
functions of power: how legal discourse produces and then conceals the
notion of the subject. And [for the purposes of claiming human
rights]{.mark}, the signifier ['Indigenous peoples' is an international
legal subject that has not broken]{.mark} -- and necessarily cannot
break -- [with international legal discourse]{.mark}.]{.underline} [That
does not foreclose the possibility that the term 'Indigenous peoples'
has social utility or disciplinary effect in other discourses. It does
mean [if the subjectivity were to fully break]{.mark} from international
legal discourse[, then whatever human rights were claimed would not be
identifi- able, intelligible or legible to others as human rights
claims.]{.mark} There is no term other than 'Indigenous peoples' to
signify all those peoples without somehow also referencing their
international legal subjectivity and therein reinforcing interna- tional
law.]{.underline}28

And this is the problem: how then can anyone now refer to all those
peoples before they were Indigenous peoples and without presupposing
that, today, they all want to be subjects of international law? How can
we refer to those 'abject beings, those who are not yet "subjects" but
form the constitutive outside to the domain of the subject'? 29
[Commonly deployed terms are problematic for understanding how rights
claims, such as FPIC, are made, because, [in order to claim FPIC as a
right, claimants must be identifiable and intelligible as Indigen- ous
peoples.]{.mark} And to be identifiable as a ['claimant' presupposes the
ability to make a claim, which signifies]{.mark} the claimant as already
[a representative of Indi-genous peoples]{.mark}. This circularity
demonstrates how power precedes and produces subjects which then
conceals that production by limiting what can be discussed intelligibly.
30]{.underline} [An effect is that the ability to claim FPIC is
dependent on others recognizing the claimant as representing Indigenous
peoples -- the struggle to be identifiable as an international legal
subject becomes, in fact, part of the struggle in claiming FPIC. 31
Because it is impossible to discuss those who seek to claim FPIC without
presupposing that they are already Indigenous peoples, this work refers
to those who may not yet be identified as Indigenous peoples as 'auto-
chthonous communities', but only where there is not a more appropriate
loca-lized term.]{.underline}

[Admittedly, the term 'autochthonous communities' is inadequate because
there is no adequate term.]{.underline}32 It is inadequate because this
book excavates international models', which is further explained in
Chapter 1. That chapter explains that [a disciplinary effect of legal
discourse is that scholars tend to adopt partial pictures of power
called legal models, which allow them to treat FPIC or Indigenous rights
as standalone objects of legal inquiry that inure to pre-existing
natural subjects. Adopting legal models conceals that the subjects who
are supposed to claim those rights are also produced, constituted and
influenced by that discourse.]{.underline}

A third consequence of a performative methodology is that terms, even
legal terms and rights claims, cannot be fixed -- as in 'mended' or
'corrected', as well as 'stabilized' or 'settled' -- especially if those
terms are useful for creating con- troversies.36 This matters because,
to various degrees, scholars who deploy legal models are, in numerous
ways, attempting to 'fix' the status and definition of FPIC so that
Indigenous peoples can use FPIC to determine and have control over their
own forms of living. [But FPIC's problems cannot be fixed by linguistic
legal parsing. Furthermore, [some attempts to fix FPIC engage in]{.mark}
historically ana- chronistic [uses of terms such as 'Indigenous
peoples', 'self-determination' and 'FPIC'.]{.mark}]{.underline} 37 The
focus on fixing FPIC elides how scholars insert themselves within
discourse to engage in productive and formative aspects of a
discipline.38 [They do not merely use language -- [they
self-discipline]{.mark}, as they are socially disciplined, to be heard
and identified as speakers of international legal discourse.
Undoubtedly, many if not all scholars are aware that they are engaging
in a debate (if not dis- course) and are attempting to create better
uses of law for Indigenous peoples. The problem is that [scholars who
attempt to fix FPIC]{.mark} perform as though they are sovereign-masters
of language who [can dominate controversy, disambiguate ambiguity, and
master all potential significations so that a term can be stabilized to
work for Indigenous peoples as Indigenous peoples desire.]{.mark} To the
extent that any scholar is successful in fixing FPIC -- which I maintain
is performatively impos- sible -- they would negate the possibility that
FPIC claimants can assert or engen- der their own versions of
self-determination. If a scholar wishes to uphold Indigenous peoples as
self-determining sovereigns, then the scholar cannot act as a sovereign
who fixes or determines anything about that term for those self-deter-
mining sovereign peoples, or, otherwise, if a scholar were successful in
fixing a definition, the scholar would vest themselves with the
sovereign authority over Indigenous peoples' rights.]{.underline} 39
[[If one were to succeed in fixing FPIC]{.mark} so that it could be used
by all Indigenous peoples[, it would be entirely consistent with the
structures of a Western imperialistic project in subjecting all
Indigenous peoples to the scholar's law.]{.mark}]{.underline}40

#### FPIC gets watered down to be consultative framework and IPC \-\-- inherently worse for indigenous voices

**Baker 13** \[Shalanda Baker is a first vice provost for sustainability

COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS," 2/12/2013,

[[One]{.mark} possible and [likely interpretation of FPIC is as
consultation, "plus"]{.mark} something else]{.underline}.102 Under this
soft approach, "consent" doesn't mean consent at all. Rather, [[project
developers would engage in]{.mark} a robust
[community-consultation]{.mark} process, memorialize the process in
writing, [and conclude that such]{.mark} [consultation]{.mark} "plus"
[is sufficient to meet FPIC standards]{.mark} and the need to mitigate
risks]{.underline}. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this approach is advocated
by the IFC. To assist its clients---project developers---with utilizing
the new FPIC framework outlined in Performance Standard 7, the IFC
published a twenty-six page document entitled "Guidance Note 7
Indigenous Peoples."103 The notes provide a section-by-section analysis
of the provisions of Performance Standard 7.104 Of particular relevance
to this article are those sections interpreting and providing guidance
on paragraphs ten through twelve of Performance Standard 7,
Participation and Consent, discussed in Part I, supra. Together, these
[Guidance Notes paint a picture that looks very much like a consultation
"plus" model of consent. In this case, the "plus" is two-fold,
comprising "a process and an outcome."]{.underline}105 According to
Guidance Note 25, [[the FPIC two-part process "builds upon the
requirements for]{.mark} \[[I]{.mark}nformed [C]{.mark}onsultation and
[P]{.mark}articipation]{.underline}\]106 (which include requirements for
free, prior and informed consultation and participation)." In addition
to the consultation process, the new FPIC model now requires an FPIC
agreement established through good-faith negotiation107 that, according
to the IFC, "captures the Affected Communities' broad agreement on the
legitimacy of the engagement process and the decisions made"108 and
"document\[s\] the roles and responsibilities of both parties and
specific commitments."109 Despite this laudable effort to broaden the
scope of engagement for indigenous communities affected by IFC-financed
projects, a close reading of the Guidance Notes reveals important
inconsistencies. These inconsistencies raise questions about the
enforceability of agreements entered under the new guidelines. A few of
these concerns are discussed below

#### Self Determination [drives conflict]{.underline} --including terrorism and suffering

**SPF 24** \[12/11/24, Sasakawa Peace Foundation, The Sasakawa Peace
Foundation (SPF) is a private Japanese foundation focused on
international cooperation and addressing global challenges, SPF,
"Mediating Self-Determination Conflicts, "
https://www.spf.org/en/peacebuilding/publications/20241211.html\]MZ

Why focus on SD conflicts? -- [[Conflicts]{.mark} arising [from]{.mark}
or resulting in [self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} (SD) claims
have for decades consistently [[accounted for half the conflicts in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} and pose specific mediation and peacebuilding
challenges. Driven by perceptions of historical oppression, exclusion,
exploitation, and injustice, which those affected feel powerless to
change, they often conclude that the only solution is some form of
autonomy. [These claims in turn challenge majority communities' sense of
the integrity of the state]{.underline}. SD conflicts often pivot on
deep-rooted socio-psychological issues of identity and belonging and are
emotionally charged. Framing of claims in relation to territory and the
linking of historical narratives of victimhood to political arguments
for SD are among the factors that make them particularly hard to
resolve.

Modes and persistence of conflict -- SD conflicts are often seen as
strictly binary as central governments generally consider it their first
duty to preserve the territorial integrity and unity of the state they
represent, [and groups seeking SD are often willing to fight and die for
independence, which they see as the only alternative]{.underline} to
continued domination and repression by the centre. Hence, [[SD conflicts
are]{.mark} often [fought with great violence and sacrifice]{.mark} on
all sides]{.underline}. Moreover, the [asymmetry in armed
forces]{.underline} between governments and SD groups often [[leads to
the use of irregular tactics]{.mark} of warfare]{.underline}, sometimes
seen as [[terrorism]{.mark}, which has frequently met with
disproportionate responses by governments]{.underline}. Taken together,
[this tends to [lead to]{.mark} highly [protracted conflicts
imposing]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} [suffering]{.mark} on civilian
populations]{.underline}. The longer they go unresolved the more complex
and intractable they become as layers of grievance and claims build up
and dynamics and positions shift over time.

#### Perception of [terrorism]{.underline} and aggression drives [military intervention]{.underline} and war

**Orth and Bialik 23** \[12/19/23, Taylor Orth is a data journalist and
public opinion researcher who covers national polling on news, politics,
technology, and society, Carl Bialik is YouGov\'s U.S. politics editor
and vice president of data science, based in New York, "Which U.S.
military interventions do Americans think have been successful?,"
YouGov,
https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48215-us-military-interventions-successful-justified-poll\]MZ

The results show that [Americans generally view [military
intervention]{.mark} as [justified]{.mark} in cases [where]{.mark} the
[U.S. is responding to acts of aggression]{.mark} [or]{.mark} protecting
U.S. allies]{.underline}. Most also believe [it is usually [justified to
prevent terrorism or stop]{.mark} the spread of weapons of [mass
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, most of the 13 recent
interventions polled about, such as those early this century in Iraq and
Afghanistan are seen as the right decision by far fewer than half of
Americans. Majorities say the U.S. was right to intervene in --- and
view as successful --- World Wars I and II. The Vietnam War is most
likely to be viewed as the result of a bad decision and also as
unsuccessful. Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role
in ending the Vietnam War.

When do Americans think U.S. military intervention abroad is justified?

To understand the [[circumstances]{.mark} that Americans believe [compel
U.S. military intervention]{.mark}]{.underline}, we presented
respondents with 13 potential reasons and asked how often they are
justified.

The goals that Americans are most likely to believe always or usually
justify intervention are:

[Responding to acts of aggression toward the U.S]{.underline}. (62%)

[Preventing terrorism]{.underline} (53%)

Protecting U.S. allies (51%)

Preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction (50%)

The smallest shares say the following always or usually justify
intervention:

Promoting U.S. business interests (20%)

Increasing U.S. power globally (23%)

Promoting democratic governance (24%)

Stabilizing regional conflicts (25%)

While the opinions of political Independents in our surveys typically
fall between those of Democrats and Republicans, that is not the case
[when it comes to evaluating U.S. military interventions.]{.underline}
Independents are significantly less likely than both Democrats and
Republicans to say that each of the 13 goals asked about always or
usually justify intervention. Differences between Democrats and
Republicans typically are smaller than differences between both parties
and Independents, though Republicans are substantially more likely than
Democrats to classify as worthy justifications the [[following three
goals]{.mark}: responding to acts of aggression, preventing terrorism,
and preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction.]{.underline}

#### War from terror is [existential]{.underline}

**Dogra 24** \[02/17/24, Bharat Dogra is a freelance journalist, author,
researcher, activist, "War Emerging Increasingly as Existential Threat,"
Counter Currents,
https://countercurrents.org/2024/02/war-emerging-increasingly-as-existential-threat/\]MZ

As the Brown University's estimates for the '[[War on
Terror]{.mark}']{.underline} of the 21st century have made clear, if
[indirect impacts of war are included then [mortality]{.mark} can be
[many times more than]{.mark} the [deaths caused directly by war]{.mark}
and conflict.]{.underline}

These estimates have stated that the '[war on terror' claimed about 0.9
million lives directly]{.underline}, but if [indirectly caused mortality
is included then this [figure rises]{.mark} much more [menacingly to 4.5
million]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words, in this context,
indirectly caused deaths are about four times the directly caused
deaths. [This figure does not include all the countries ravaged by the
[war on terror]{.mark}, and needs updating too.]{.underline}

This is a reminder that the enormous death toll of the 20th century is
being maintained in the 21st century, more or less, if we add up the
mortality of all the dozens of wars and conflicts of the world during
the first 23 years of the 21st century.

What is more disturbing is that talk of the possibility of the third
world war and a nuclear war has been heard more during the last two
years than in the several decades preceding this, largely due to the
possibility of a direct conflict between the USA/NATO and Russia, taking
off from the ongoing proxy war in Ukraine, and to a lesser extent the
possibility of a direct war between the USA and China. An even broader
war with NATO, a few Asian allies and possibly Australia on one side and
the 'axis' of Russia, China, Iran and North Korea on the other side has
also been discussed as a more distant possibility which, however, cannot
be entirely ruled out, even though it would surely be a complete
disaster.

Eisenstein, when asked about what a third world war would look like
responded that he does not know how the third war would be fought, but
the fourth one would be fought with stones. He was referring of course
to the reality of wars [becoming [so destructive]{.mark} that the third
world war would in fact [ruin the world almost
entirely]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Wars have become even more destructive since Eisenstein spoke these
words, and their [destructiveness appears destined to increase further,
as more and more resources and human ingenuity are being diverted to
increase destructive capabilities instead of constructive ones, even
though millions and millions remain deprived of even basic needs and the
requirements of ecological repair and rehabilitation are perhaps the
most urgent.]{.underline}

Hence while the 20th century witnessed a [[six fold increase in war and
conflict]{.mark} related mortality]{.underline} compared to the 19th
century , the 21st century may witness something unique and
unprecedented in the already highly destructive history of war and
conflict---it may witness [wars with the [capacity of wiping
out]{.mark}, in terms of direct and indirect impacts, most of [the life
on earth and]{.mark} almost the entire [human
life]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} apart from disrupting very badly the
basic life-enabling and life-nurturing conditions of the planet.

### AT: Net-Benefit\-\--Self-D\-\--Defense 

#### Consultation isn't enough for self-determination -- giving back the land is key

**Klein et al. 23** \[10/23, Lawrence Robert Klein was an American
economist, María Jesús Muñoz-Torres is a Professor of Finance and
Accounting, María Ángeles Fernández-Izquierdo is a Professor of Finance
and Accounting, "A comparative account of indigenous participation in
extractive projects: The challenge of achieving Free, Prior, and
Informed Consent, " Elsevier,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X2300059X\]MZ

Unfortunately, there is not one clear definition of the meaning of
'consent' and this is what makes most companies introduce mere window
dressing policies to their codes of conduct and keeps them from fully
integrating the principle of Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)
into their corporate culture. FPIC has been identified as the 'gold
standard' of community engagement because it requires 'the highest form
of participation of local stakeholders in development projects' (FAO,
2016: 50). FPIC provides a means to [[indigenous peoples to]{.mark} put
[their right to self-determination]{.mark} into practice and '[goes
beyond consultation']{.mark}, [a participatory right]{.mark} that is
traditionally regarded 'an individual right of each
citizen']{.underline} (Cambou, 2019: 40). Consultation, as it applies to
indigenous peoples, forms part of their collective rights as distinct
polities and requires both states and companies to rethink current
governance mechanisms around community participation.
[[Self-determination implies]{.mark} that [indigenous peoples]{.mark}
can [autonomously]{.mark} [govern their 'internal and local
affairs']{.mark},2 define 'their economic, social and cultural
development']{.underline} (Cambou, 2019: 34) [and [regain control over
the lands]{.mark}, territories, and [natural resources they have]{.mark}
traditionally occupied and managed]{.underline} (Szablowski, 2010;
Barelli, 2012; Cambou, 2019). 'FPIC is not only a question of process,
but also of outcome' (Anaya et al., 2017: 5) and must include the option
of withholding consent and withdrawing consent at any stage of the
project cycle (FAO, 2016; UNPFII, 2005).

While companies 'are beginning to recognize that consultations are not
optional' (Anaya and Puig, 2017: 447), it is precisely because of its
connection to the right to self-determination and the right to give or
withhold consent, that [FPIC is often interpreted as a sort of 'veto
power' held by indigenous peoples]{.underline}, prompting [[concerns
connected to]{.underline}]{.mark} national sovereignty, [[state control
over natural resources]{.mark}, and corporate economic
objectives]{.underline} (Cambou, 2019; Leydet, 2019; Tomlinson, 2019;
Szablowski, 2010). Concerning Article 32.2. on FPIC and the exploitation
of natural resources in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP, 2007), indigenous peoples apply a
'purposive' interpretation, which sees 'consent as a mandatory
requirement' of the FPIC process, while companies and states generally
take a 'textual approach' to the article, which identifies FPIC 'as an
extension of consultation processes' (Papillon et al., 2020: 225). [In
operational terms this means that companies tend to apply an
'instrumentalist approach' to consultation]{.underline}, which they
identify as a 'participatory mechanism' analogical to a
'notice-and-comment' procedure, thus overshadowing 'concern for any
substantive rights (Anaya and Puig, 2017: 448). At worse, companies take
a 'minimalist approach' to consultation, converting it into a
'check-the-box' activity with consultations constituting 'a sizeable
bureaucratic obstacle that hinders productive activity' (Anaya and Puig,
2017: 450[). Both [approaches clash with indigenous peoples' view
of]{.mark} prior [consultation]{.mark}, as entailing the possibility to
say 'yes' or 'no' to a project affecting them.]{.underline}

removed]{.underline}. The [[Sámi Parliament]{.mark} was [stripped
of]{.mark} [political authority]{.mark}]{.underline} and [relegated to a
consultative capacity]{.underline}.Footnote21 Its mandate is to
represent the Sámi in Finland nationally and internationally, and to
promote and protect the Sámi language and culture. The Sámi Parliament
is also entitled to issue proposals and statements to various
authorities on matters relating to the Sámi. [It is [financed by the
state]{.mark} and [operates under the Ministry of
Justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although the Sámi Parliament's status
improved from that of the weaker Sámi Delegation, [[it lacks
self-government authority and jurisdiction]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
decision-making power of the Sámi Parliament is limited]{.underline} to
hiring staff, organising elections, creating Sámi-language educational
materials, and determining the allocation of the annual state budgeted
funds for Sámi cultural activities and organisations.

[The idea behind the Sámi Parliament was to establish a]{.underline}
dynamic [framework that would enable the development of Sámi
self-government by the Sámi community]{.underline}. The [[goal was to
progressively advance self-government]{.underline}]{.mark} by refining
the provisions within the Sámi Parliament Act, thus [[reinforcing the

self-government. [Yet]{.mark} the [inverse]{.mark} has
[occurred]{.mark}, and the [growth of Sámi self-government]{.mark}

[stymied]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over its [two-decade-plus
existence]{.underline}, there has [not been a single amendment to the
Sámi Parliament Act that represented a progression of Sámi
self-government]{.underline}.Footnote22 Not surprisingly, long-standing
Sámi leaders have expressed unease with the elected Sámi body focused
only on cultural and language matters [without authority to advance the
Sámi status as an Indigenous people with land
rights]{.underline}.Footnote23 [This is a [growing
concern]{.mark}]{.underline} in the current context of exponential
[increase of development pressures on Sámi territories in the name of
decarbonisation and energy transition.]{.underline}

### AT: Net Benefit\-\--CIL 

#### [CIL FAILS]{.underline}---CIL defines [broad norms]{.underline}, never [individual]{.underline} law. Inherent [imprecision]{.underline} destroys enforcement.

**Hakimi '20** --- Monica; James V. Campbell Professor of Law and
Associate Dean for Faculty and Research at the University of Michigan
Law School, JD from Yale Law School, BA from Duke University. 2020;
"Making Sense of Customary International Law"; Michigan Law Review,
Volume 118, Issue 8; https://repository.law.umich.edu/mlr/vol118/iss8/2/

Although scholars debate just how ineffective CIL is, they almost always
assume that its efficacy depends on its capacity to establish stable
primary rules. And many insist that its efficacy is impaired. 93For
instance, Karol [Wolfke]{.underline} has said that \"the frequently
[expressed doubts about \[CIL\'s\]]{.underline} present
[usefulness]{.underline} . . . seem to be fully justified,\"
[\"\[c\]onsidering \[its\]]{.underline} complexity,
[imprecision]{.underline}, and relative slowness.\" 94Carlos Vásquez has
asserted that [[CIL\'s elasticity presents \"opportunities for
evasion]{.underline}]{.mark} or contestation\" [[that
undercut]{.underline}]{.mark} \[\*1504\] [its
[efficacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. 95Andrew Guzman agrees: [\"\[T\]he lack
of precision in CIL rules does indeed undermine the force of the rules
and generate skepticism about their importance.\"]{.underline} 96

The usual response to these criticisms is, like the ILC\'s, to double
down on the rulebook\--to insist that CIL\'s secondary rules limit its
elasticity and help establish stable primary rules. 97As I explain
below, this response is uncompelling. [[CIL does not]{.mark} actually
[conform to a rulebook]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [as long as the
rulebook conception is the metric for evaluating it, CIL will come up
short]{.underline}. But what if the rulebook conception is misinformed?
What if the problem lies not with CIL but with the conceptual apparatus
that we have been using to assess it?

III\. A PRACTICE-ORIENTED ALTERNATIVE

It\'s hard to overstate just how dissociated the rulebook conception is
from CIL\'s day-to-day operation. As discussed, [[the process]{.mark}
for CIL [is]{.mark} extremely [messy and]{.mark} produces a lot of
[disconnected]{.mark} raw data]{.underline}. In the rulebook conception,
this process can create CIL only if the output satisfies certain
secondary rules and manifests as primary rules. The ILC Conclusions say
that, for this to happen, the mix of practice and opinio juris must be
sufficiently clear and consistent. Otherwise, the output cannot be CIL.

That depiction of CIL is inaccurate. It does not describe the normative
material that global actors in the ordinary course recognize and use as
CIL. This material neither derives from secondary rules nor manifests
only as primary rules. The reason why is that the disorderly process for
CIL largely determines what it is. 98Because this process is so messy,
the normative material that it produces does not come only, or even
primarily, in the form of rules. [[It]{.mark} often [is contingent and
variable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Put differently, although the CIL process
sometimes produces norms that have the clarity and stability of rules,
[most of its normative [output is]{.mark} more
[fragmentary]{.mark}\--treated and accepted as CIL by some actors or in
certain settings but not by or in others]{.underline}. This material
cannot be CIL under the rulebook conception. But it routinely shapes how
people understand and interact with CIL. It is in a very real sense CIL.

\[\*1505\] To be clear, I am here presenting an alternative account of
CIL that describes what it is as a real-world sociological phenomenon.
Let me address at the outset one likely objection. Some will say that
CIL, as I am describing it, is too unmoored or inconstant to be law. A
prominent family of jurisprudential theories posits that law is by
definition rule-like\--that in order for a social practice to constitute
law, it must in key ways conform to a rulebook. 99The objection would be
that CIL must satisfy the rulebook conception in order to be law.

However, the jurisprudential theories that define law in rule-like terms
are not the only available ones; others are compatible with my account.
100Moreover, the idea that all law must conform to the same universal
criteria, no matter its social context, is itself suspect. People in
this world understand law in all sorts of ways. My goal is not to
resolve what law is in some universal sense but rather to describe a
particular kind of law. If the material that global actors routinely
accept and treat as law does not satisfy a certain jurisprudential
theory, the logical conclusion is not that the material is not law but
that the theory is incomplete; it is detached from and an inadequate
barometer of what law \"is\" in the real world. After all, law is not
just an abstract theoretical proposition. It is a social phenomenon. To
understand how CIL functions as law, we need to move beyond those
theories\--as I do here.

A. The Practice of Customary International Law

[CIL\'s defining [characteristics are not clarity]{.mark} or consistency
[but]{.mark} high levels of fluidity, [uncertainty]{.mark}, and
contestation]{.underline}. These characteristics are a function of the
CIL process. Because this process is so unstructured, [[it lacks
mechanisms to regulate]{.underline}]{.mark} which normative positions
are advanced through it or how [[particular
positions]{.underline}]{.mark} play out. Two important points follow.
First, the salience of a position within CIL\--the extent to which the
position is recognized and used as CIL\--does not depend on whether it
satisfies certain secondary rules. What matters instead is how the group
of actors who participate in a given domain of global governance
interact with the position. \[\*1506\] Second, because global actors
take different stances on the normative positions that are batted around
in the CIL process, these positions do not consistently take the form of
conduct rules. They are often inconstant.

**International Law is [broken]{.underline} and not
[effective]{.underline}.**

Linda **Kinstler 25**, writer at the Guardian, 6-26-2025, \"Are we
witnessing the death of international law?\",
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jun/26/are-we-witnessing-the-death-of-international-law

The [[criticisms]{.mark} of [international law]{.mark} are
**familiar**]{.underline} and, in some sense, **[[impossible to
deny]{.underline}]{.mark}**: that it is [[too
**weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that it is **[[selectively
applied]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that it is [[merely an
**extension**]{.mark} of **[state power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "We are
all [[prisoners]{.mark} of this **[horizontal
system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where states have to keep each other in
check, and that will inevitably fall subject to politicisation," Yusra
Suedi, a lecturer at the University of Manchester, told me. It is
essentially an opt-in system: weak states that flout its directives are
called pariahs or rogues; powerful states that do so are called
hegemons.

For critics of the field, the problem is not just that law doesn't stop
wars or protect civilians, but [also that it [offers]{.mark} a
vocabulary for [states]{.mark} to [justify]{.mark} the **[unchecked use
of]{.mark} [force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Breaches are not the
**exception** but the rule]{.underline}. For instance,
[[international]{.mark} humanitarian [law]{.mark} restricts the use of
**certain kinds of weapons**]{.underline}, such as **[cluster
bombs]{.underline}**, that are "[indiscriminate by nature, capable of
**causing harm**]{.underline} without d[istinguishing]{.underline}
between combatants and civilians". [That [did **not stop
Israel**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which first ratified the convention on
certain conventional weapons in 1995, from deploying cluster bombs
against a civilian population in 2006, during the Lebanon war. (Israel,
like the US, Russia, Iran and China, refused to sign the 2008 convention
on cluster munitions.) More than 1,000 people were killed, approximately
one-third of whom were children. The Israeli military claimed that the
use of cluster bombs was not a violation of international law, because
they were focused on military targets and because the population of
Beirut's southern suburbs, an area called Dahiya, had been warned of the
attack in advance.

It was during that conflict that Israeli forces developed what is now
known as the "Dahiya doctrine", which permits the use of
"disproportionate" force against civilian population centres in certain
circumstances. The attack on Dahiya was a blatant violation of what is
known as the "principle of proportionality" in international law, which
holds that civilians may not be attacked if the result is "excessive in
relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated". The
UN human rights council formed a commission to look into the event,
which concluded that "there was no justification" for the use of cluster
bombs.

Every scholar [who **[laments]{.mark}** the [**waning** of
**international law**]{.mark} will have their own moment when the rot
set in]{.underline}. In Koskenniemi's view, it came in the 1960s when
its original goals of peace and justice started to be displaced by the
administrative and managerial [[imperatives]{.mark} of
[globalisation]{.mark}. For the Israeli legal scholar Itamar Mann,
Dahiya felt like the [beginning of the end]{.mark} of international law
[as a credible]{.mark} [system for **preventing
atrocities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "They weren't just ignoring the rule:
the[y were invoking it for the very purposes that it was [supposed to
**limit** or **control**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. By
[[attempting]{.mark} to **[justify]{.mark}** a **[legally]{.mark}
[unjustified action]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the [language of
**international law**]{.underline}, Israel made a mockery of the spirit
and letter of the law. "In general, that was the moment when the idea
that an entire neighbourhood can be eliminated, or close to that, came
on the radar," said Mann. As we spoke about the condition of
international law writ large, he slipped into the past tense: "It was a
way of challenging brute uses of force, and that is no longer there."

### AT: Net-Benefit\-\--Climate

#### No impact to climate change

**Wang 23** \[4/17/23, Seaver Wang works at the Breakthrough Institute
as Director of the Climate and Energy team, "There Is No Climate Tipping
Point," The Breakthrough Institute,
https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/climate-change-banned-words/climate-tipping-point-real\]MZ

It turns out the [future of our climate is a little more
complicated]{.underline} anyways. Many aspects of my unfinished novel's
imagined climate future are very much a part of the research consensus
on climate change---more frequent and intense wildfires, changes in the
water cycle, the decimation of pine forests by invasive beetles. [My
underlying [assumption]{.mark}]{.underline}, however---that at some
specific moment in my lifetime, [the [Earth]{.mark} would [cross]{.mark}
a climate [tipping point]{.mark}]{.underline} and descend into
self-reinforcing madness---[was entirely
[incorrect]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For the set of likely future scenarios we face today, the
[[climate]{.mark} science [literature]{.mark} has [not
identified]{.mark} [any]{.mark} approaching [global tipping
point]{.mark}]{.underline} after which runaway climate change
intensifies beyond humanity's ability to arrest it. [While
[tipping]{.mark} [elements]{.mark}]{.underline} of the climate
system---like Arctic permafrost thaw and loss of Amazon forest
area---[do influence total warming, the [magnitude]{.mark} of this
influence is [substantially smaller]{.mark}]{.underline} than the
societal factors that will ultimately determine the planet's climate
trajectory.

To you, the reader, the lines above may feel stiff and overly qualified.
They, like countless similar sentences in IPCC reports and academic
papers, rely on very careful choice of terminology to maintain their
accuracy. Yet such care seems increasingly incompatible with a climate
discourse that, at times, nurses a weakness for spectacle while trying
to satisfy a hunger for clarity about the future that researchers cannot
yet provide.

One example that holds fascination for me today, just as it did for my
younger novelist self, is the topic of tipping points. More formally
called "climate tipping elements," this subject is a continuously
evolving body of knowledge that has been particularly susceptible to
confusion and misinterpretation.

Over the years, groups of earth scientists have offered slightly
different definitions of tipping elements, and lists of proposed tipping
elements have changed with various additions and removals. Tropical
monsoons and abrupt changes in the El Niño cycle have fallen out of many
lists, while worry over the East Antarctic ice-sheet's stability is
increasing. Meanwhile, research that presents a range of possible
climate impacts after global temperatures cross some theorized tipping
point often gets summarized by writers and journalists using upper-end,
worst-case potential outcomes.

It is not particularly surprising that when arcane scientific detail
meets simplistic reporting, it results in a muddle, and it's a muddle
the term "tipping point" itself---evoking an abruptness and immediacy
not necessarily characteristic of most, let alone all, tipping
elements---perhaps adds to. Climate tipping points and "runaway climate
change" are now common parlance in climate conversations, and while
different advocates may mean different things in practice when using
these terms, they speak to a broadly shared, yet [[inaccurate]{.mark},
[understanding]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the [climate system is]{.mark} on
the verge of very [unstable]{.mark}, self-reinforcing, [and]{.mark}
abruptly [rapid disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It isn't. And [it's important to understand that it isn't]{.underline}.
Taken at rational face value, the [[feeling]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the
[planet is]{.mark} just years away from [sliding beyond a catastrophic
point]{.mark} of no return [invites unproductive
fatalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, the [perception of an
imminent climate cliff]{.underline} seemingly rules out long-term
planning in favor of emergency measures, [skewing [discussion]{.mark} of
climate policies in ways that can be
[counterproductive]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Working with indigenous people to expand their rights for the purpose
of reducing deforestation requires a deep understanding of their
culture]{.underline}, among other issues. Additionally, the
[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} of such activities
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[difficult to
measure]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially as the
[[results]{.underline}]{.mark} of such activities [[may take]{.mark}
some [time]{.mark} to manifest]{.underline}. Although research indicates
that there are generally lower deforestation rates in lands that are
under indigenous stewardship as opposed to other Amazonian areas outside
that category, [how much correlation or causation exists is debatable
and, [based on historical data, it is difficult to predict how
much]{.mark} expanding [indigenous land rights would]{.mark} actually
[reduce deforestation]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
future.112 Furthermore, although some research has been done on how
individual indigenous groups have been able to combat deforestation in
combination with various conservation organizations, little has been
done in evaluating the impact that specific organizations have on
deforestation as they work with indigenous people.113

Additionally, [there have been multiple instances where [indigenous
tribes]{.mark} in the Amazon have been granted legal rights over pieces
of land, but then turned around and [sold]{.mark} those [rights
to logging companies]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the tribes wanted the
money more than the land, [[and deforestation
continued]{.underline}]{.mark}.114 [Another struggle with expanding and
granting indigenous land rights is [enforcing]{.mark} those rights,
which [takes time, money, and heavy government
involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as defining the responsibility
of indigenous peoples for the sustainability or deforestation of their
lands.115

It is perhaps surprising, then, that there is [[little]{.mark} scholarly
[merit]{.mark} in the notion [that]{.mark}]{.underline} a short-term
reduction in access to [[food increases]{.mark} the probability that
[conflict]{.mark} will break out]{.underline}. This is because to start
or participate in [violent conflict requires people to have both the
means and the will. Most people on the brink of starvation are not in
the position to resort to violence]{.underline}, whether against the
government or other social groups. In fact, the urban middle classes
tend to be the most likely to protest against rises in food prices,
since they often have the best opportunities, the most energy, and the
best skills to coordinate and participate in protests.

Accordingly, there is a widespread misapprehension that social unrest in
periods of high food prices relates primarily to food shortages. [In
reality, the sources of [discontent]{.mark} are considerably [more
complex]{.mark} -- [linked to]{.mark} political structures,
[land]{.mark} ownership, [corruption]{.mark}, the desire for [democratic
reforms and]{.mark} general [econ]{.mark}omic problems]{.underline} --
where the price of food is seen in the context of general increases in
the cost of living. [Research has shown]{.underline} that [[while
the]{.mark} international [media]{.mark}]{.underline} have a
[[tend]{.underline}]{.mark}ency [[to seek]{.underline}]{.mark} [simple
[resource]{.mark}-related [explanations]{.mark}]{.underline} -- such as
drought or famine -- for conflicts in the Global South,
[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark} in the local media
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} permeated by [more
[complex]{.mark}]{.underline} political relationships.

"[[Tribal consultation]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[refers to the federal
government's **legal obligation** to consult with Native American tribes
on **energy and infrastructure** projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
highways and railroads, pipelines, telecommunications towers and
systems, and electrical transmission lines. [Whenever a given project
requires some sort of federal approval]{.underline} -- a water-crossing
permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, for instance, or a
certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a new
natural gas pipeline -- [the]{.underline} tribal **[consultation
requirement kicks in]{.underline}**.

[The [project **need not be on tribal land** for the]{.mark} tribal
consultation [requirement to apply]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the
contrary, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), along with many other federal laws,
mandate that [**the lead agency** on each project must consult with all
affected Indian tribes, on a government-to-government
basis]{.underline}. This is [true whether the project is on public or
private land]{.underline}. The rule of thumb is that [[if a project
needs federal permission]{.mark} to proceed, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[federal [agency considering it **must** identify]{.mark} the [tribes in
the]{.mark} project [area and consult with them in a **meaningful
fashion**]{.mark}]{.underline} before making any final decisions.
