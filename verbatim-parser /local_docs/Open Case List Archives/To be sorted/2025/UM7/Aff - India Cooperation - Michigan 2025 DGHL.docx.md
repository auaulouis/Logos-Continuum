RUSSIAN MILITARIZATION OF THE ARCTIC AND INDIA

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has significantly
[**[intensified]{.mark}** its [**military presence** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[includes **collaboration** with
India]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian strategy [focuses on **military
security**, **protection**, and **defense** in the Arctic
Zone]{.underline}. Measures include [enhancing forces\' structure,
combat readiness, armament, and basing infrastructure, and utilizing
dual-use technologies and]{.underline} facilities for defense. These
actions demonstrate Russia\'s [[commitment to border defense and
**readiness**]{.underline}]{.mark} for potential combat scenarios (RMNI,
2020).

Russia\'s expansion and modernization of military bases and airfields in
the Arctic, driven partly by its invasion of Ukraine, has led to more
Russian bases than NATOs (Gronholt-Pedersen & Fouche, 2022). Russia and
China were spotted patrolling waters near Alaska in August 2023
(Williams & Novak, 2023). Russia has the largest icebreaker fleet in the
world and has [[equipped]{.mark} some of these [**icebreakers** with
military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Burgess, 2023). As noted by
Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), Russia has also
tested new Arctic-based military capabilities such as hypersonic cruise
missiles and nuclear-powered undersea drones (Conley, Melino, &
Alterman, 2020). This has led, according to CSIS senior US military
leaders, to express growing [[concern about]{.mark} the prevalence of
[Russian **cruise missiles**]{.mark} in the Arctic and their "avenue of
approach]{.underline}" to the US In turn, this is leading NATO to
increase its own presence in the Arctic to counter Russia's presence
(Gronholt-Pedersen & Fouche, 2022).

Russia's militarization of the Arctic accelerates sea ice loss and
permafrost thaw and increases geopolitical tensions, undermining
international cooperation on Arctic protection. Despite these risks,
Russia is a critical supplier of arms to India, and conducts joint
military drills with China and India (Al Jazeera, 2022; Ferris &
Nouwens, 2023). India and China have access to the Russian military zone
in the Arctic, and without US outreach, [[India]{.mark} may find itself
further [drawn into]{.mark} the **[Russian military
sphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [making it more [challenging for the
**US**]{.mark} and its allies [to keep]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} as a
**[demilitarized]{.mark}** region]{.underline} (Stackhouse, 2023).

Russia's desire to expand regional influence in Asia, coupled with
[[India's growing Arctic aspirations suggest]{.mark} that **[bilateral
cooperation]{.mark}** on the [Arctic between India and Russia]{.mark}
[is **plausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Russia may seek to enhance
ties with both India and China separately, India\'s cautious approach to
collaboration with China limits the likelihood of a trilateral
partnership. Given this scenario, the [[importance]{.mark} of
[**cooperation** between]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and India]{.mark} in the Arctic cannot be
overstated]{.underline}. Additionally, India\'s strategic interests in
the region, including climate security and economic development,
[aligning with the US can bolster efforts [to **counterbalance Russian
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline} while promoting sustainable practices
in the Arctic. [Moreover, **[U.S.-India collaboration]{.mark}** can
[facilitate **scientific research**]{.mark}, technological
**[innovation]{.mark}**, and policy development aimed at
[safeguarding]{.mark} the **[fragile Arctic ecosystem]{.mark}** and
mitigating the [impacts of **climate change** on a **global
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Arctic expansion sparks [nuclear war]{.underline} with [Russia]{.underline}.

**Rempe '23** \[Rebecca; May 9; B.A. in Political Science from the
University of Western Ontario, pursuing a M.A. in Security,
Intelligence, and Strategic Studies at the University of Glasgow; The
Security Distillery, "The Meltdown: Nuclear Relations in the Arctic,"
https://thesecuritydistillery.org/all-articles/the-meltdown-nuclear-relations-in-the-arctic\]

Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between multipolar
nuclear conflict and climate change. Multipolarity is defined as a
global balance of power between multiple actors \[3\]. Climate Change is
making seaways and resources more accessible, which is leading to a
thawing of territorial conflicts which were formerly frozen \[4\].
China's increasing economic interests in the Arctic means it must be
considered as a regional actor despite its near-regional status \[5\].
[[Russia]{.mark} has]{.underline} recently [[threatened to use
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} against the United
States (U.S.) due to its objections to Russia's invasion of Ukraine;
this [[sets]{.mark} a [**precedent** for]{.mark} heightened]{.underline}
nuclear [[**tension** in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
is [the most **nuclearized area** in the world]{.underline} and has seen
a steady buildup of nuclear and conventional forces by regional actors
\[6\]. These factors have led to direct tensions between three major
nuclear actors (namely, NATO, China, and Russia) in [a region that is
becoming **increasingly competitive**]{.underline} \[7\]. These tensions
cannot be adequately explained by existing deterrence models, which rely
on Cold War-era bipolar game theory \[8\]. Due to climate change,
geopolitical tension, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nuclear
[[relations]{.mark} in the Arctic are **[unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and present serious security risks that [**cannot be contended**
with]{.underline} through the use of classic [**deterrence**
theory]{.underline} \[9\].

ARCTIC GOVERNANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE

The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the
United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and
Iceland, all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the
Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently
lies under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea,
however, due to climate change, polar ice is melting, making the region
more accessible by sea and opening up its vast oil and gas deposits for
extraction by regional actors \[11\]. 

Sino-Russian cooperation along sea routes has given China significant
influence in the region, which it wants to develop into a "Polar Silk
Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White Paper \[12\]. Chinese
development interests do not align with Russia's geopolitical goals in
the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic infrastructure represents
an economic threat to Russian interests \[13\]. There is growing
[competition between]{.underline} these regional [actors]{.underline}
which [is exacerbated by overlapping territorial **boundary
claims**]{.underline} by Denmark, Canada, and Russia. In addition, the
Arctic Council has suspended cooperation due to its chairmanship by
Russia until the end of 2023 \[14\]. 

DETERRENCE AND ARCTIC NUCLEAR RELATIONS

Classic nuclear deterrence is steeped in Cold War bipolarity and relies
on two rational actors basing their decisions on what they believe their
opponents\' actions will be \[15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed
through the Chicken Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's
options are to defect and pursue a foreign policy objective or to
cooperate and maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an
actor is to defect against a cooperating partner; however, [this runs
the risk of]{.underline} both players defecting, leading to **[nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}** \[18\].

\<\<\<Figure Omitted\>\>\>

This classic deterrence game does not contend with the possibility of
conflict between multiple nuclear actors, which is a key feature of
Arctic security \[19\]. Though a three-player chicken game has been
applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three players
needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete, this
model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. China, NATO,
the U.S., and Russia's nuclear doctrines are informed by deterrence
theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption of a bipolar
world order \[21\]. 

[Nuclear multipolarity in the Arctic is **unstable**]{.underline}
because it no longer falls within the traditional game theory matrix,
and [there is an increased risk]{.underline} of nuclear action [[due
to]{.mark} a larger [number of]{.mark} nuclear
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline} and significant regional tension \[22\].
Preemptive nuclear strikes are more prevalent in multipolar nuclear
politics due to a greater perception of threat from other actors \[23\].
Though China promotes itself as a No First Use (NFU) state, meaning that
it will not strike unless struck upon in a nuclear capacity, [Russia has
threatened to **strike first**]{.underline}, and America's position on
NFU is vague \[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent organisation in the
Arctic region, only Sweden is not yet a full NATO member and Finland has
just recently gained NATO membership \[25\]. In multipolar deterrence,
[[regional conflicts]{.mark} are more **likely to [escalate]{.mark}**
in[to **total nuc**]{.mark}lear **[war]{.mark}**fare]{.underline}, and
de-escalation relies on political bargaining as opposed to rationality
modelling. Thus, it is unclear how political bargaining will take place
in an increasingly polarised Arctic \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty \[27\]. This [[breakdown in
**communication**]{.underline}]{.mark} between Arctic actors [[due
to]{.mark} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Russia's recent threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S.
[[indicates]{.mark} that [future]{.mark} regional [disputes
over]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic resources,
**[[navigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **territory**]{.mark} may
give [**rise** to **nuclear crises**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[28\].

#### US-India arctic partnership solves [downside risks]{.underline} of Russian dependency AND positions India as a [neutral actor]{.underline}.

accessed: 6.25.25\]

Advance Strategic Autonomy by Reducing Russian Defence Dependencies

[[**India's**]{.mark} reliance on Russia]{.underline} for defence
equipment has historical roots and is likely to remain in place for the
foreseeable future. However, [New Delhi has [begun to
**diversify**]{.mark} its **defence [supply chain]{.mark}** in recent
years, especially [through]{.mark} the '**[Make in India']{.mark}**
initiative]{.underline} and partnerships with Western nations.69) The
ongoing war in Ukraine has exacerbated delays in Russian defence
deliveries,70) which could erode confidence in Russia's reliability as a
defence partner.71) It is plausible that continued reliance on Russia
for defence supplies may ultimately restrict India's push for greater
strategic autonomy.

The [[Western Arctic]{.mark} countries [need to **seize**]{.mark} on
[this **opportunity** and attempt to **proactively engage**]{.mark} with
[India by **accelerating** their **defence** and **security
ties**]{.mark} with New Delhi]{.underline}, such as through the
Nordic-India Summit which have been taking place since 2018. The [Arctic
states also need to [reconsider their stance on]{.mark}
**[exclusivity]{.mark}** in the **Arctic** and instead [be willing to
**invite India** into]{.mark} **various [Arctic
processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the other hand, [[needs to
**diversify** its **partnerships** with]{.mark} countries that **share**
its **security outlook**]{.underline}, including [[the
**US**]{.underline}]{.mark}, France, and other Western allies. This
[would **[reduce]{.mark}** the [**risks** associated with]{.mark}
**Russian [dependencies]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [[align India]{.mark}
more closely [with]{.mark} the **[defence frameworks]{.mark}** of its
Arctic partners]{.underline}. Additionally, by [[reducing]{.mark} its
[**dependence** on **Russian arms**]{.mark}]{.underline}, India [could
[avoid undermining]{.mark} its [image as]{.mark} a **[neutral]{.mark}**,
**responsible [actor]{.mark}** [on the global
stage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a [shift would [enable India to better
integrate into **coalitions**]{.mark}]{.underline} in regions [[where
Russian influence]{.mark} is [viewed with
suspicion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Ultimately, an Arctic strategy that strikes a balance between India's
relations with Russia and the Western Arctic states is more likely to
[[reinforce]{.mark} India's **[strategic autonomy]{.mark}** by [enabling
it to maintain]{.mark} a **[balanced position]{.mark}** in its
relationships with other major powers]{.underline}, thereby
[[enhancing]{.mark} its [role as a **credible security partner**]{.mark}
on the **world stage**]{.underline}.

#### Indian influence solves every threat.

[An [**indispensable requirement** to]{.mark} charting [India's]{.mark}
**path** to [**power** is]{.mark} getting the country back on a **high
[growth]{.mark}** trajectory]{.underline}. It is [the **substance** of
**economic muscle** rather than **mere**]{.underline} posture of
**[strength]{.underline}** which [will [expand **room for
manouevre**]{.mark} in an era of geopolitical contestation. This
requires not only **sustaining** but]{.underline} also [**expanding**
the outward orientation of the economy]{.underline} and its becoming
part of both regional and global supply chains. Atmanirbhar Bharat must
not mean a relapse into a high-cost and low-quality economy which
prevailed before the 1990s. India's future as a great power requires its
integration with the regional and global economy and [India must
[**position** itself as]{.mark} the **[engine of growth]{.mark}** for
the entire subcontinent]{.underline}. The Neighbourhood First policy
needs to be underpinned by regional economic integration and SAARC
should be utilised as an important platform for achieving this, even if
Pakistan does not cooperate. Sidelining SAARC carries the risk of other
member countries inviting China to be a full member which will only
serve to complicate the security challenge for India. China has already
set up a grouping consisting of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri
Lanka for cooperation with China on regional connectivity and
development. [India could become a **preferred partner** to]{.underline}
its **[South Asia]{.underline}**n neighbours in their pursuit of social
and economic development, [drawing upon]{.underline} the advantage of
proximity, the size of the Indian market and the deep cultural
[**[affinities]{.mark}** that [bind]{.mark}]{.underline} the people of
[the [subcontinent together]{.mark}]{.underline}.

India is at a stage of its development cycle when it needs large
infusions of capital and technology. India can leverage its benign
partnerships with the key knowledge and financial centres of the world,
in particular, the US, Europe and Japan, to build a stronger and modern
economy. The evolving geopolitical situation places India in a sweet
spot because of concerns about a rising challenge from China. Recent
domestic developments in China, with growing hostility towards its
hitherto vibrant private sector, is raising uncertainties and fears
about the safety and viability of western investment in China. India's
economy alone offers a scale comparable to China. This would help
transform India into one of the most dynamic and modern economies by the
end of the current decade. The critical policy decisions to achieve this
must be taken now.

The paper acknowledges that China will remain the biggest challenge for
India in virtually all metrics of power. The collusion between China and
Pakistan has acquired an even greater salience due to the recent
withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and the Taliban takeover of the
country. India's strategy to meet this collusive threat needs a review.
There is no option but to raise the level of military preparedness on
our land frontiers but leveraging, in parallel, the country's maritime
assets and its partnerships with other naval powers in the Indo-Pacific,
including through Quad.

[Most]{.underline} of the [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that
confront the country [are [**global** in scope]{.mark} and not amenable
to **national** or even regional solutions. These include **public
health** challenges such as the **Covid**-19 [pandemic]{.mark} that is
still **ongoing** and the **impending threat** of global **[climate
change]{.mark}** which may have **catastrophic consequences**. These
[demand **global**]{.mark} and **collaborative** [responses]{.mark}
**infused** with a spirit of **[internationalism]{.mark}**. [India has a
**tradition** of supporting]{.mark} **multilateral** institutions and
processes and [can play a **leadership**]{.mark} **[role]{.mark}** [in
**reviving** them]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will mean reorienting
India's foreign policy towards mobilising the large constituency of
emerging and developing countries with which India shares
[concerns]{.underline} and interests on a large number of issues. This
also points to the importance of India's traditionally close relations
with Russia and Iran. These [include the growing salience of
**[cyber]{.mark} security**]{.underline} and data privacy [and the
regulation of **[advanced tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies [such as
**[A]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence.

India possesses a great asset in its visionary and liberal Constitution
as a guidepost to the country's destiny as a great power. It draws upon
India's civilisational attributes while envisioning a modern and
democratic society. It commits the state to extending security, health
and education to all its citizens through policies that are inclusive
and egalitarian. The individual rights and duties inscribed in the
Constitution recognise the immense diversity of India as one of its
greatest strengths, with citizenship transcending but not rejecting
individual or community identities. It is these intrinsic national
strengths which convince the authors that [India is the **[only
country]{.mark}** [which]{.mark} in terms of area, size]{.underline} of
population [and]{.underline} scientific and technological [capabilities
[can]{.mark}]{.underline} match, and even [[surpass,
China]{.underline}]{.mark} and [emerge]{.underline} [as a parallel
**civilisational state**]{.underline}, as has been the case through most
of recorded history.

6.5 Conclusion: India's possible role in the ongoing scenario

Against the backdrop of these multiple regional geopolitical
developments in the Arctic, [[India without **taking
sides**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[seeks]{.mark} a [re-return of
**dialogue**]{.mark} in the **region**]{.underline}. Arctic states
[[need to find]{.mark} some [measures for]{.mark} the [resumption
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[suspended cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the region where the [[initial revival in]{.mark} **scientific** and
**academic [collaborations]{.mark}** could [act as re-starting
pointers]{.mark}]{.underline} (bottom-up approach). [[India's strong
**bilateral relations**]{.mark} with all the Arctic states]{.underline}
could possibly be [[used as a bridge to revive]{.mark} some level of
**[lost cooperation]{.mark}** between these states]{.underline}, where
the support of other Asian states could further supplement such
initiative. It is important to highlight that despite optimism, India
has always [[emphasized states]{.mark} on **[respecting]{.mark}** the
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** and territorial integrity of each other and has
[called for]{.mark} the [**peaceful resolution** of
disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} as per the existing international
mechanisms.

#### [Non-neutrality]{.underline} prevents India from solving [Ukraine]{.underline}.

**Panda '25** \[Jagannath; January 14; Research Fellow and Centre
Coordinator for East Asia at the Institute for Defence Studies and
Analyses (IDSA), New Delhi; USIP, "Can [India **Advance Peace** in
Ukraine]{.underline}?,"
https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/01/can-india-advance-peace-ukraine;
accessed: 6.25.25\]

What actions has India taken to date regarding the war in Ukraine?

Panda: [[India]{.mark} has [pursued]{.mark} a largely **[neutral
stance]{.mark}** regarding the war [in **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline},
abstaining from most U.N. resolutions condemning Russia's actions and
emphasizing dialogue and diplomacy.

Despite Western pressure, India has [[maintained its **relationship**
with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. While Modi has occasionally criticized
Vladimir Putin's war, he has also been [careful to avoid **offensive
undertones**]{.underline}. The Indian establishment has carefully
guarded its "privileged strategic partnership" with Russia and views
Russia's declining fortunes in the global order as a strategically
significant and unfavorable shift for India.

Modi has also been [interested in peacebuilding efforts]{.underline} and
has met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on multiple occasions.
while India has significantly increased its imports of discounted
Russian oil since the conflict began, it has also sent medical supplies,
equipment and relief materials to Ukraine as part of its humanitarian
response. India has [also made other [**concrete efforts** to support
**Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as pushing to open the Black Sea
Grain Corridor and maintaining a direct line with Russia about Ukrainian
concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as well as pushing to
boost economic ties.

This approach has [[contributed to]{.mark} a form of **[shuttle
diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} wherein Delhi seeks to [[maintain
communication]{.mark} c]{.underline}hannels with both Russia and
Ukraine, [[positioning itself as]{.mark} a peacemaker and **[dialogue
facilitator]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Modi followed travel to Moscow in
July --- a symbolic trip as his first overseas travel after being
elected to office for a third time --- with a historic visit to Kyiv in
August, which marked the first time an Indian leader has visited Ukraine
since its 1991 independence.

The visit served to not only revitalize bilateral ties but also signal
to the West that India is invested in the future of Ukraine.
Importantly, the visit led to Zelenskyy proposing a peace summit in
India aimed at ending the war; although this is hardly settled as of now
as India would like to include Putin in any type of peace summit, it
demonstrates the extent to which Modi's visit was [[successful in
positioning]{.mark} India [as a potential **peacemaker**]{.mark} in the
**conflict**]{.underline}.

What are India's motivations and aspirations for its diplomacy, and what
are potential limitations or obstacles?

Panda: [India's approach to [**Ukraine** reflects]{.mark} a careful
balance among its historical ties with Russia, growing strategic
partnership with the West]{.underline}, and the [principles of
"**[strategic autonomy]{.mark}**" central to its foreign
policy]{.underline}. As a nuclear power surrounded by nuclear rivals,
[escalation between **Russia** and **Ukraine** has been a genuine cause
for India's unease]{.underline}. India has also been [[concerned about
the **war's**]{.mark} [continuing **impact**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
Global South's food and energy insecurity. Under Modi, [India has sought
to **position** itself **cautiously** as a leader in the Global
South]{.underline}, which is emerging quite clearly as a sphere of
competition between India and China.

In the emerging multipolar world, strategic autonomy and an independent
foreign policy have become cornerstones of India's foreign policy. This
[**framework envisions** India acting as a bridge between **competing
blocs**]{.underline}. Its high-level meetings with both Russia and
Ukraine help to reinforce this image.

India is **[[constrained]{.underline}]{.mark}** to some degree
[[by]{.mark} its [historic and **strategic
partnership**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can [[invite **skepticism**
from]{.mark} other [potential partners]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite
diversification, India's defense sector [[relies heavily on]{.mark}
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}n technology and equipment, and this
[[**dependence** makes it]{.mark} [vital for Delhi to **navigate** its
position]{.mark} on the war **[delicately]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Ukraine war [goes nuclear]{.underline}.

**ICAN '24** \[International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons; November
21; ICAN, "New Russian doctrine increases possible nuclear weapons use
scenarios,"
https://www.icanw.org/new_russian_doctrine_increases_possible_nuclear_weapons_use_scenarios;
accessed: 6.25.25\]

On 19 November, [**[Russia]{.mark}** officially [adopted]{.mark} a
**[new]{.mark}** [nuclear **weapons doctrine**]{.mark} announced in
**September**]{.underline}. The new policy states that [Russia could
[launch]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** [in response
to]{.mark} an **[attack]{.mark}** on its territory [by]{.mark} [a
**non-nuclear**]{.mark}**-armed [state]{.mark}** [backed by]{.mark} a
[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [one]{.mark}]{.underline}. While experts debate
how novel the doctrine is given similar proclamations in the past, it is
important to take the nuclear threat, and the escalatory intent behind
it, seriously.

ICAN condemned the new doctrine when it was announced in September,
saying: "Today's updates to Russia's [nuclear
**[doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline} outlining when Russia would use
nuclear weapons are **[[dangerously ambiguous]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
They [[blur the line between **conventional** and **nuclear**]{.mark}
**attack and** [undermine **predictability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[increasing]{.mark} the **[risk of nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

Just two days later, on 21 November, [**[following]{.mark}** a
**[U.S.]{.mark}** change in [**policy** allowing Ukraine to launch
**U.S. supplied**]{.mark} long-range **[missiles]{.mark}** inside
Russia]{.underline}, news agencies reported that the Ukrainian Air Force
said that Russia had launched an ICBM into the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.
[[Experts]{.mark} initially [cast]{.mark} [doubt]{.mark} on
[whether]{.mark} it was an **[ICBM]{.mark}** that [was
**fired**]{.mark}, and Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed
during a televised address that it was a "new" intermediate-range
ballistic missile]{.underline} in "response to US plans to produce and
deploy intermediate and short-range missiles". A Pentagon spokesperson
also noted the US was pre-notified of the ballistic missile launch
through nuclear risk reduction channels just prior to the launch.
However, this incident demonstrates the risk of escalation in a
nuclear-armed world. [An [**unexpected launch** of]{.mark} a
**[nuclear]{.mark}-capable [missile]{.mark}**, [even without]{.mark} a
nuclear [warhead]{.mark}, [can be **confused** or **misinterpreted** in
the **fog of war**]{.mark} and [lead to **inadvertent
escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Past false alarms have nearly started
nuclear wars.

Title: The [[**centrality** of]{.mark} the [**Arctic** in]{.mark} the
**[India-Russia partnership]{.mark}**]{.underline}

While defence deals and military technical agreements will be high on
Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s agenda during his visit to India
next week, there is a need to pay attention to the drivers of the future
bilateral trajectory. [Russia\'s Arctic and its Far East region [offer
an **area of convergence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the [[potential to
**scale up relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [New Delhi\'s year-old
draft Arctic Policy with its **[5+5 mission]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
pillars outlines [[India\'s interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, \"[[to
enhance]{.mark} sustainable and **[mutually beneficial
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between **India** and the **Arctic
region**]{.underline}]{.mark}\".

For Russia, the Arctic is its natural coast-to-coast sphere and has
outsized importance. Long before St Petersburg was established on the
shores of the Baltic in the 18th century as a \"window onto Europe\",
Russia set up its base in Okhotsk in 1650. Today, the Russian
Federation, from the east to west, has the longest Arctic coastline with
2.5 million people, living above the Arctic Circle. The region accounts
for 80% of Russia\'s known natural gas reserves and contributes 12% of
its Gross Domestic Product.

In recent years, Russia\'s focus on the Arctic has grown, as has that of
other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states with Arctic
shores - Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway and the United States (US).
Russia\'s National Security Strategy in 2015 (updated in 2021) had a
non-military triple approach to the Arctic - resource exploitation;
infrastructure development; and international cooperation. This forms
the basis of Russia\'s long-term Arctic policy till 2035.

Contrary to views about Russia\'s muscular Arctic approach, defence
development and military matters have actually been de-emphasised. Even
Russia\'s Armaments Plan (2018-2027) de-emphasises the High North.
Having possibly achieved its optimum military presence in the Arctic,
Russia is now signalling that the Arctic and the Far East region is a
zone of cooperation and development.

[As [Russia looks to expand]{.mark} its [energy]{.mark} export
[from]{.mark} the **[Arctic shelf]{.mark}** and the shores of the
Pechora and Okhotsk Seas to Asia]{.underline}, which it outlines as a
\"strategic resource base\", [[India is]{.mark} a \"**special and
[privileged partner]{.mark}**]{.underline}\". Energy ties with Russia
are crucial for India\'s transition from fossil fuels to cleaner sources
of energy. As a win-win outcome, India should work the mechanisms to
enhance infrastructure and energy development plans in the Russian Far
East as emphasised at the Sixth Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.

[[With]{.mark} Russia developing the northern sea route
(**[NSR]{.mark}**) [as]{.mark} a critical \"[national transport
corridor]{.mark}]{.underline}\", [[India can **project its hydrographic
capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a member of the Hydrographic
Commission on Antarctica, India co-produced with Russia the Bathymetric
chart. India\'s experience can add value to the mapping of Arctic
routes.

The shipping activities in the NSR and the on-shore energy projects will
require skilled sectors and a trained workforce. Interestingly, India
ranks third globally in providing seafarers in the maritime sector.
[[Tie-ups with **Russian universities** offering seafaring
courses]{.mark} in polar waters can [skill the **Indian youth**]{.mark}
in the **maritime industry**. [As **economic opportunities**
increases]{.mark}, the [Russian Arctic]{.mark} could [become a **migrant
worker destination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[**Connectivity** is another **driver** in]{.mark} the strategic
partnership [with underlying **commercial advantages**]{.mark} and
overall **economic development**]{.underline}. Parallel to the
multimodal International North-South Transport Corridor, the proposed
Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor (CVMC) to connect the eastern
Indian ports with Vladivostok, Vostochny and Olga on the east coast of
Russia will act as an extension to the NSR, which otherwise has limited
benefit for India both in terms of shipping distance and travel time.
[It will also **[sharpen]{.mark}** India\'s [**strategic intent**
in]{.mark} the **[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea
[and]{.mark} the **[Indo-Pacific]{.mark}** region, [with]{.mark} a
**[naval presence]{.mark}** [securing its energy]{.mark} and trade
shipments [from]{.mark} the **[Russia]{.mark}**n Far East]{.underline}.

The Arctic and the Far East region give unmatched complementarities to
both countries. [[For Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [[showcases its
**reliability**]{.mark} as far as difficult geography is concerned,
while [for India]{.mark}, the [**partnership** expresses]{.mark} a
[**confident country** willing to explore **creative diplomatic
pathways**]{.mark} for its development]{.underline}.

[Russia's Struggling Navy]{.underline}: Why [[Power Projection Remains
Elusive]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[One of]{.mark} the **[few countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that
can]{.mark} project a credible]{.underline}, worldwide power
[[project]{.underline}]{.mark}ion presence [[is the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates. Though [Russia]{.mark} would no
doubt like to be a part of that exclusive]{.underline} club, the
[**[technological know-how]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
[money]{.underline} [[to support a **global naval
fleet**]{.underline}]{.mark} [are [not there]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Russian Navy

The Russian Navy today is a [shadow of the formidable maritime force
that the Soviet Union had]{.underline} at its disposal during the Cold
War. At its apex, the Soviet Navy operated an immense fleet with global
reach, tailor-made to counter the navies of the United States and its
NATO allies.

However, the Soviet Navy's international role was severely abbreviated
by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of Cold War hostilities.

One stark example of the Soviet Navy's [decline is Russia's
[present-day]{.mark} aircraft carrier [program]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
the modern Russian Navy [[relies on a **single carrier**]{.mark}, the
Admiral Kuznetsov]{.underline}.

Modern Sea Power

This carrier, which was launched in 1985, has become emblematic of the
Russian Navy's struggles. Frequent mechanical problems, an outdated
design, and accidents during modernization efforts have rendered Admiral
Kuznetsov more a symbolic carrier than an operational one. Russian
shipyard's somewhat limited capacity to build new aircraft carriers ---
let alone keep the sole Russian carrier afloat --- underscores the
country's diminished power projection.

In contrast, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates Navy
[has]{.mark} **[eleven]{.mark}** aircraft carriers, each with dozens of
fourth- and fifth-generation fighters onboard. Unparalleled in the
history of modern naval warfare]{.underline}, the United States Navy
remains the pinnacle of American power projection around the globe.

While Russia maintains a capable submarine fleet, including new Borei
and Yasen-class vessels, its surface fleet has been reduced to smaller
ships, such as frigates and corvettes, which [[lack]{.mark} the
[**endurance** and **firepower**]{.mark}]{.underline} to operate as an
effective blue-water fleet.

Long-range, Hypersonic, and Stand-off Munitions

Despite these challenges, Russia does retain some power projection
capabilities, mainly via Moscow's long-range precision weapons. The
Russian Navy's Kalibr cruise missiles and hypersonic Tsirkon missiles
provide a credible strike capability, and its submarine fleet remains an
indispensable element --- arguably the most crucial element --- of
Russia's nuclear triad.

The War in Ukraine: A Problem for the Russian Navy

Russia's naval limitations are particularly apparent in context to its
challenges in projecting power over Ukraine. Despite sharing a long land
border and possessing a not insignificant military advantage, [Russia
has been [unable to dominate]{.mark} the [**maritime theaters**
of]{.mark} the [war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Russia's [Black Sea Fleet, based in **Crimea**, has been central to
operations in **Ukraine** but has faced **several
difficulties**]{.underline}. First and foremost among these are
Ukrainian forces, which have effectively used asymmetrical tactics,
including unmanned maritime drones, to target Russian ships. The sinking
of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, in [2022 was a
significant blow to Russian naval prestige and a strong indication of
its **vulnerabilities** to unmanned naval systems]{.underline}.

Additionally, Ukraine's success in the Black Sea has hindered Russian
naval operations and severely impacted its ability to dominate important
naval areas. [Efforts to blockade Ukrainian ports and curtail grain
exports have faced **strong pushback** from countries around the
world]{.underline}, highlighting the lack of international support that
Russia enjoys.

This [situation underscores just how vulnerable the Russian
Navy]{.underline} is: a country that [cannot control the **maritime
situ**ation in its near abroad will likely [face]{.mark} [**significant
setbacks** to dominate]{.mark} in **[international
waters]{.mark}**]{.underline}, given the significant logistical and
operational challenges long-distance and long-term deployments entail.

#### Strong Indo-Russian arctic ties bolster Russia's naval fleet.

India-Russia Cooperation In Shipbuilding

In July 2024, Indian Prime Minister Narendra [Modi undertook a two-day
visit to Moscow]{.underline}, where he [met with Russian President
Vladimir Putin]{.underline}. During this meeting, [India and Russia
agreed to enhance collaboration across various sectors]{.underline},
[including nuclear power and shipbuilding]{.underline}.

The two sides [endorsed collaboration in developing shipping between
Russia and India through the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} and
[expressed their readiness]{.underline} to establish a joint working
body within the IRIGC-TEC to facilitate this cooperation.

Russian state nuclear corporation ROSATOM announced that discussions
were underway regarding new areas of cooperation, such as constructing
six additional high-power units of Russian design at a new site and
Russian-designed small nuclear power plants.

Additionally, ROSATOM and Indian partners explored ways to develop the
transit potential of the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which extends from
Murmansk, near Russia's border with Norway, to the Bering Strait near
Alaska. This development is particularly focused on facilitating the
supply of Russian oil, coal, and liquefied natural gas.

Against this backdrop, "[ROSATOM plans to construct four non-nuclear
icebreaker ships in India]{.underline}," according to an official
familiar with the situation, said ET Infra report. The shipbuilding
order is being finalized at the request of both the Indian and Russian
governments.

Additionally, the official, who requested anonymity, noted [that India
and Russia are considering a memorandum of understanding for
shipbuilding and the repair of Russian vessels at Indian
shipyards]{.underline}, [as well as for training Indian seafarers in
polar waters]{.underline}.

These plans were discussed during the first meeting of the 'Joint
Working Group on Cooperation in the Northern Sea Route between Russia
and India' held on Thursday.

To support these initiatives, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF)
and India's Enso Group have agreed on a partnership for joint
investments of up to Rs 1,800 crore (approximately \$225 million) in
shipbuilding infrastructure development.

But Why?

[Due to Western sanctions and other challenges]{.underline}, [European
shipyards]{.underline} are [unable to construct these vessels for
Russia]{.underline}, while shipyards in [China, South Korea, and Japan
are fully booked until at least 2028]{.underline}.

Consequently, [Russia is exploring alternatives]{.underline}, and India
stands out as a reliable partner with which it has strong relations.
This is why ROSATOM is [seeking Indian shipyards to build the icebreaker
vessels]{.underline}, explained a second official familiar with the
discussions regarding the potential order.

"The Northern Sea Route presents a universal platform for fostering
multifaceted cooperation across various sectors. We see [significant
potential for collaboration with India in areas such as developing cargo
flows, building shipyards, enhancing port infrastructure]{.underline},
and engaging Indian scientists in ROSATOM's environmental projects in
the Arctic," a public relations manager for ROSATOM State Corporation in
South Asia stated in an emailed response to ET Infra on August 20.

Opportunities & Challenges

[While discussing potential orders]{.underline}, a government official
indicated that "[Russia is ready to do everything to get the icebreaker
ships constructed in India, promising additional ship orders in the
future]{.underline}."

A Russian delegation, including ROSATOM officials, visited Indian
shipyards to assess their capabilities and infrastructure. The Indian
government is providing all possible support to these shipyards;
however, concerns remain regarding the type of steel required for
construction and the sourcing of engines for the icebreaker vessels,
according to ET Infra reports.

Balancing Act: Russia's Relations With India & China

The Russia-India collaboration on icebreaker construction [marks a
significant milestone in their bilateral relations]{.underline} and in
the broader context of Arctic cooperation. This partnership not only
strengthens India's position in global shipbuilding but also
[establishes India as a significant player in Arctic
matters]{.underline}.

#### Russian naval dominance [guarantees]{.underline} global conflict escalation in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

Because this [[conflict]{.mark} is Eurasian]{.underline}, it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[naval]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Its
[**greatest flashpoints** are]{.mark} **enclosed [maritime]{.mark}
spaces**]{.underline}, [commercial and **strategic [nexus]{.mark}
points** in]{.underline} the [Eurasian littorals]{.underline} -- the
[[Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark} and [Eastern
[Mediterranean]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Strait of
[Hormuz]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[Bab-el-Mandeb]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [**[S]{.mark}**outh and **[E]{.mark}**ast **[C]{.mark}**hina
**[S]{.mark}**eas are all **crucial chokepoints** for **global
commerce**]{.underline}. The [[contest for
supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark} may have landward elements, but it [is
**essentially [naval]{.mark}** [in character]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is [**readily [apparent]{.mark}** [in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} the CCP's [[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark} has [expanded
its [capabilities]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [[**express purpose**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an [assault on [Taiwan]{.mark} and **concurrent
naval war** with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} and its allies.
It is marginally less apparent in Europe, where Russia wages a ground
war in Ukraine. Even in Ukraine, however,
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} objectives have been [[maritime in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, if not in character. Russia seeks to
conquer a country that, if added to its productive power, would give the
Kremlin a stranglehold over the global wheat, corn, barley, and
fertilizer supply. Ukraine added to the Kremlin's domain would also
provide it with an ideal base from which to dominate the Mediterranean,
play a decisive role in the Middle East, and regulate the Suez
chokepoint. Thus, even a power so decidedly continental as Russia still
employs a maritime strategy. The United States can, in the abstract,
encounter each threat individually. Yet the issue is twofold. First,
these threats are likely to come in sequence. This may be intentional: a
coordinated trans-Eurasian campaign is possible. Indeed, the issue of
force coordinated is largely overrated. China and Russia need not fight
alongside each other in the same battlespace apart from if Russia
deploys its submarines to support China in the Western Pacific. Hence
the question is not of operational coordination or even theater
strategic coordination, but very general coordination at the political
level. It may also be opportunistic at a lower level. Major power war
will be foreseeable in an operational context: it is hard to move masses
of men and materiel to readiness without detection. But smaller probing
actions are more difficult to anticipate. Minor revisionist powers, Iran
for example, may take advantage of American distraction and use limited
capabilities to stress the U.S.' strategic position. Larger powers may
employ opportunistic pressure. Second, these [[threats]{.mark} can be
[deterred only by]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**comprehensive
[military]{.mark}** [prepared for]{.mark} **large-scale
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S. military is not prepared for this.
It lacks the stockpiles, manpower, or industrial base to sustain a major
confrontation. Ukraine would burn through American annual 155-millimeter
shell production in two weeks, and annual American Anti-Tank Guided
Missile production in two months. Unmanned Aircraft System platforms in
Ukraine last three or so missions and are destroyed at 90 percent. War
is massively expensive and requires a massive amount of equipment. This
is true on land and at sea. Platforms themselves are irrelevant if they
cannot be sustained in combat. And the U.S., with its atrophied
industrial base, will struggle to expand production within the next two
to five years. There is a **[significant [danger]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that the [U.S.' [allies identify]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[window]{.mark}
of opportunity [in which]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite its nominal
military superiority, it [[lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[stockpiles
to]{.mark} fight and [win]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[long-term
major-power war]{.underline}**. A multi-front war would be immensely
stressful to American capabilities. It may be reasonable to expect,
despite capability gaps that persist between the U.S. and its rivals,
that a coordinated campaign in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East would
crack the United States. [This can be [prevented]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [[U.S.' ability to deter]{.mark} conflict]{.underline} should be
[[regained]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile the [U.S.
[Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} - the primary warfighting arm for any future
Eurasian conflict, [must be [**expanded** and]{.mark}
**[better-resourced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The current NDAA is a start,
providing \$45 billion more than the Biden administration\'s initial
proposal. Yet this is, at best, a minimal initial move. The Pentagon
expects China\'s combat fleet to grow from its current level of 340
ships to 400 by 2025, or 20 ships yearly. Were the U.S. to build 20 each
year, it would reach --- in 2025 --- slightly above China's current
fleet size, but the Biden administration isn't even planning to build
half that number.

[**[India]{.mark}** could be [a **key**]{.mark} **strategic
[partner]{.mark}** [for the **U.S.**]{.mark} in its efforts [to protect
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [currently threatened by
the increased **commercial** and **military presence** of
Russia]{.underline}. This is because [[India has]{.mark} major
**[climate]{.mark}**, **socio-[economic]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
[**security** interests]{.mark} [in the Arctic which]{.mark} could
[**align** with the **U.S.**]{.mark}]{.underline} through appropriate
climate-centric cooperation.

Yet, the [**[U.S.]{.mark}** at present [does not **include India**
in]{.mark} its **[Arctic strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This omission
has [[allowed Russia to establish closer ties]{.mark} with India on
Arctic affairs]{.underline}. It is therefore [[critical]{.mark} that
[the role of India in]{.mark} securing [**long-term** U.S. Arctic
**aspirations** be]{.mark} [reflected in]{.mark} this updated U.S.
**Arctic [defense strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[India is [becoming a **major Arctic power** with]{.mark} the [capacity
to assist the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} in protecting the Arctic. In
2022, India released its first Arctic policy, which illustrates the
country's vested interest in conserving the region.

The policy recognizes that "changes in the Arctic, especially melting
Arctic ice, can be highly disruptive for national development,
sustainability of over 1300 island territories and maritime features,
and the welfare of 1.3 billion Indians." A recent study found that there
is a strong connection between Arctic sea ice loss and extreme Indian
Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall events.

The Indian Summer Monsoon has a crucial indirect effect on India\'s
economy, as it provides 80% of India's rainfall. Therefore, the
protection of the Arctic is essential to the long-term socio-economic
and security interests of India.

Protection of the Arctic is also in the interests of the U.S. due to its
desire for a peaceful and stable Arctic to prevent further geopolitical
tensions in the region. India's emerging role in the Arctic therefore
presents an opportunity for cooperation with the U.S, provided the
appropriate defense policy is put in place.

However, [U.S. [**outreach** to India]{.mark} on the Arctic [has been
**minimal**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as reflected in the fact that [no
**prior** U.S. policy document has considered the implications of
**India's role**]{.underline} in the Arctic for its own climate security
objectives.

This has [led [Russia]{.mark} to begin the process of [**courting
India** to support]{.mark} (and be part of) its [efforts to
**commercialize** and **militarize** the region]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
exchange for access to emerging trade routes.

Accelerates the loss of Arctic sea ice

[Russia's strategy focuses on [using]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orthern
**[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute for Russian companies [to deliver
strategic energy]{.mark} resources [to global
markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia has entered into negotiations with
India and China for the supply of icebreakers, which are crucial for the
increase of traffic along the Northern Sea Route.

This [commercial expansion into the Arctic [accelerates]{.mark} the
[loss of Arctic sea]{.mark}]{.underline} [[ice]{.underline}]{.mark},
therefore [[posing]{.mark} a [threat to U.S. climate security
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. [India\'s [participation in]{.mark} the
**Russian Vostok [Military Drills]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} its **[arms
procurement]{.mark}** from Russia further adds to these
**[risks]{.mark}** by [**destabilizing** the **Arctic**]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} increased **[military activity]{.mark}**, which in turn
exacerbates sea ice loss]{.underline}.

The U.S. has expressed concern at Russia's interest in the Arctic in its
prior defense strategy, but has yet to consider whether it could work
with India to mitigate Russia's influence in the region.

A **[[science-based approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the Arctic [[is
**essential**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[necessitates]{.mark} **U.S.
[collaboration]{.mark}** [with **India** to realign **defense
strategies**]{.mark} to mitigate the consequences of Russia's actions on
climate security]{.underline}.

The release of the new Arctic defense strategy represents an opportunity
for the U.S. to integrate the India dimension into its climate security
considerations. U.S. cooperation with India is possible given both
State's long-term interest in climate protection of the Arctic.

This would be of benefit to both States, in that the [U.S. would [gain
**new partners**]{.mark} in its efforts [to **contain
Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[India would gain **enhanced**
international **legitimacy**]{.mark} regarding its role [in **Arctic
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [the first step to any
further relationship in this area will be the inclusion of India in the
new U.S. Arctic defense strategy]{.underline}.

#### Collaboration creates a voice for the [global south]{.underline}, [aligns India]{.underline} and [isolates Russia]{.underline}.

COUNTERING RUSSIAN INFLUENCE THROUGH US OUTREACH TO INDIA

[[To **counter**]{.mark} the risks of **[Russia\'s engagement]{.mark}**

India** with **short-term economic incentives**]{.underline}]{.mark},
contrary to US interests. This [should start through **cooperation** in
**science**, **research**, and **technology**]{.underline} to align both

SCIENCE-LED U.S.-INDO COOPERATION TO ADVANCE US AND INDIAN LONG-TERM
INTERESTS

[**India** [has]{.mark} great [**capacity** for
**multi-alignment**]{.mark}]{.underline} and its [role as a [voice for

U.S.-India [Arctic policy]{.mark}]{.underline} (CFR, 2023; Lin, 2023).
While the US has not taken account of India in its Arctic policy, [both
[countries]{.mark} have been working on strengthening their **[broader
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **[security
relationship]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and [this should [now be expanded

SCIENCE-LED COOPERATION BETWEEN THE US AND INDIA

The US has taken steps to strengthen its relationship with India through
the Roadmap for U.S.-India Defense Industrial Cooperation, fast tracking
technology cooperation and co-production in areas such as land and air
combat, intelligence, surveillance among others. This initiative will
provide India access to cutting-edge technologies and support its
defense modernization plans (DOD, 2023). India and the US have also
already worked together on studying monsoon science through the
Enhancing Knowledge of the Arabian Sea Marine environment through
Science and Advanced Training (EKAMSAT) program, which examines the
interactions between monsoon predictions and the Arabian Sea (Indian
Ministry of Earth Sciences, 2023).

[[Initiating Arctic **scientific collaboration**]{.mark} to analyze
teleconnections would be a promising step to [**further strengthen**
U.S.-India **cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. India\'s inaugural
Arctic expedition illustrates this potential. [Expanding Arctic

CONCLUSION

The US and India share a vested interest in safeguarding the Arctic. For
India, stringent regulation of commercial and military activities in the
Arctic is crucial to averting exacerbated instability to its lifeline --
the monsoon rains. Similarly, the US seeks to avoid exacerbating climate
damage by refraining from expanding activities in the Arctic, while
strategically challenging its rival, Russia, by curtailing its
commercial and military influence. The geopolitical advantages of Arctic
cooperation present mutual benefits for both, the US and India, provided
a sciencebased approach centred on climate protection shapes their
bilateral strategy on the Arctic.

India\'s [**emerging influence** in the Arctic **presents a
unique**]{.underline} [**opportunity** for the US A climate-focused
partnership is not just feasible, but **imperative** for the future of
the Arctic and the shared interests of both nations]{.underline}. By
embracing this path, the US and India [[can forge]{.mark} a [powerful
**alliance** for Arctic climate protection, leaving a **lasting impact**
on the **region** and **beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [fluctuation of Arctic sea ice concentration]{.underline} (SIC) has
been [associated with changes in ocean circulation, ecology, and
Northern Hemisphere climate]{.underline}. Prediction of sea ice melting
patterns is of great societal interest, but such [prediction remains
difficult because the factors controlling year-to-year sea ice
variability remain unresolved.]{.underline} Distinct [monsoon--Arctic
teleconnections modulate summer Arctic SIC]{.underline} largely [by
changing]{.underline} wind-forced [sea ice transport]{.underline}. East
Asian monsoon rainfall produces a northward-propagating meridional
Rossby wave train extending into the Siberian Arctic. The Indian summer
monsoon excites an eastward-propagating circumglobal teleconnection
along the subtropical jet, reaching the North Atlantic before
bifurcating into the Arctic. The remote Asian monsoon variations induce
a dominant dipole sea ice melt pattern in which the North
Atlantic--European Arctic contrasts with the Siberian--North American
Arctic. The monsoon-related sea ice variations are complementary and
comparable in magnitude to locally forced Arctic Oscillation
variability. [The monsoon--Arctic link will improve seasonal prediction
of summer Arctic sea ice and]{.underline} possibly [explain long-term
sea ice trends associated with the]{.underline} projected [increase in
Asian monsoon rainfall]{.underline} over the next century.

Scientific Research, Space Science and Climate Change

[India is home to a major part of the **Himalayas**]{.underline}, which,
at times, is [referred to as the **Third Pole**]{.underline}. The
drastic melting of the glaciers, flooding of the plains, severe monsoon
effects, and inundation of coastal cities due to climate change are
serious concerns in India. [India, in the policy document, speaks
clearly about the impact of **climate change** on its economy and its
effect on the yield of **summer crops** such as rice, pulses, and
soybeans which contributes to almost **50% of India's food
output**]{.underline}, which is [totally dependent on the **monsoon
cycle** and the **glacial waters** that feed its river
system]{.underline}. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, cannot
afford to risk its food security, water security, and economic security.

The [Arctic Policy emphasises the need to study the **linkages** between
the **glaciers** in the **Arctic** and **Himalayas**, citing the IPCC's
Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere (2019]{.underline}). The National
Center for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) is the nodal body that
functions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, which conducts research
activities and various scientific expeditions in both the poles and also
in the Himalayas. [India sees itself as a '**Tripolar state'**, with its
presence in both the poles through its **research**
facilities]{.underline}, and [in the Himalayas, through which it is able
to **contribute efficiently** in the area of **scientific** and
**environmental research**]{.underline}, [especially in the area of
climate change by **harmonising** the research conducted in **the Polar
Regions** and the **Himalayas**]{.underline}.

India is also interested in working with the various working groups of
the Arctic Council to contribute towards the conservation of Arctic
flora and fauna, marine environmental protection, addressing
environmental emergencies, search and rescue efforts, and more. The
Policy focuses on further [strengthening India's **scientific research**
through **cooperation** with Arctic states and other
partners]{.underline}. To increase its capacity, India is planning to
set up dedicated institutional funding support for Arctic research at
the national level.

#### The plan solves Arctic sustainability, research, and militarization.

RUSSIAN MILITARIZATION OF THE ARCTIC AND INDIA

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has significantly
[**[intensified]{.mark}** its [**military presence** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[includes **collaboration** with
India]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian strategy [focuses on **military
security**, **protection**, and **defense** in the Arctic
Zone]{.underline}. Measures include [enhancing forces\' structure,
combat readiness, armament, and basing infrastructure, and utilizing
dual-use technologies and]{.underline} facilities for defense. These
actions demonstrate Russia\'s [[commitment to border defense and
**readiness**]{.underline}]{.mark} for potential combat scenarios (RMNI,
2020).

Russia\'s expansion and modernization of military bases and airfields in
the Arctic, driven partly by its invasion of Ukraine, has led to more
Russian bases than NATOs (Gronholt-Pedersen & Fouche, 2022). Russia and
China were spotted patrolling waters near Alaska in August 2023
(Williams & Novak, 2023). Russia has the largest icebreaker fleet in the
world and has [[equipped]{.mark} some of these [**icebreakers** with
military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Burgess, 2023). As noted by
Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS), Russia has also
tested new Arctic-based military capabilities such as hypersonic cruise
missiles and nuclear-powered undersea drones (Conley, Melino, &
Alterman, 2020). This has led, according to CSIS senior US military
leaders, to express growing [[concern about]{.mark} the prevalence of
[Russian **cruise missiles**]{.mark} in the Arctic and their "avenue of
approach]{.underline}" to the US In turn, this is leading NATO to
increase its own presence in the Arctic to counter Russia's presence
(Gronholt-Pedersen & Fouche, 2022).

Russia's militarization of the Arctic accelerates sea ice loss and
permafrost thaw and increases geopolitical tensions, undermining
international cooperation on Arctic protection. Despite these risks,
Russia is a critical supplier of arms to India, and conducts joint
military drills with China and India (Al Jazeera, 2022; Ferris &
Nouwens, 2023). India and China have access to the Russian military zone
in the Arctic, and without US outreach, [[India]{.mark} may find itself
further [drawn into]{.mark} the **[Russian military
sphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [making it more [challenging for the
**US**]{.mark} and its allies [to keep]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} as a
**[demilitarized]{.mark}** region]{.underline} (Stackhouse, 2023).

Russia's desire to expand regional influence in Asia, coupled with
[[India's growing Arctic aspirations suggest]{.mark} that **[bilateral
cooperation]{.mark}** on the [Arctic between India and Russia]{.mark}
[is **plausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Russia may seek to enhance
ties with both India and China separately, India\'s cautious approach to
collaboration with China limits the likelihood of a trilateral
partnership. Given this scenario, the [[importance]{.mark} of
[**cooperation** between]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and India]{.mark} in the Arctic cannot be
overstated]{.underline}. Additionally, India\'s strategic interests in
the region, including climate security and economic development,
[aligning with the US can bolster efforts [to **counterbalance Russian
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline} while promoting sustainable practices
in the Arctic. [Moreover, **[U.S.-India collaboration]{.mark}** can
[facilitate **scientific research**]{.mark}, technological
**[innovation]{.mark}**, and policy development aimed at
[safeguarding]{.mark} the **[fragile Arctic ecosystem]{.mark}** and
mitigating the [impacts of **climate change** on a **global

That said, [India's policy clearly states that any engagement with
Arctic resources must align with principles of sustainability.
Responsible exploration and exploitation is the baseline for any Indian
involvement.]{.underline}

66° North: Let's turn to aspects not included in India's Arctic policy
-- specifically, the geopolitical dimensions. The Arctic Policy avoids
addressing these issues directly, yet India is an increasingly prominent
global maritime and political actor with a well-defined security
profile. How does India view the evolving security landscape in the
Arctic, and did these developments influence its Arctic Policy, even if
not overtly?

Anurag Bisen: Before I respond, let me add a caveat: the views I express
here are my personal opinions and do not reflect the official position
of the Government of India. In fact, some of what I say may not align
with the government's current stance. That said, you're right -- the
policy deliberately steers clear of geopolitical and security concerns,
though strategic intent is subtly embedded within it.

The second-last pillar of the policy, for instance, discusses governance
and international cooperation[. **India expresses its commitment** to
**promoting peace and stability** in the Arctic in accordance with
international law and established treaties. We explicitly uphold the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and affirm our
active participation in **global climate and environmental frameworks**
relevant to the Arctic.]{.underline}

"I see the Arctic today as the site of an intensifying strategic
triangle involving the United States, Russia, and China. India's two
most important strategic partners -- Russia and the United States -- are
deeply engaged in the Arctic."

At the Arctic Circle India Forum in early May, India's External Affairs
Minister, Dr S. Jaishankar, was interviewed by Iceland's former
president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. Asked a similar question, Dr
Jaishankar stated that India would engage with the Arctic as it does
elsewhere: by working with all stakeholders, and always in line with its
national interests.

Personally, I see the Arctic today as the site of an intensifying
strategic triangle involving the United States, Russia, and China.
[India's two **most important strategic** partners -- **Russia and the
United States** -- are deeply engaged in the Arctic. We have high-level
strategic partnerships and conduct 2+2 dialogues with both.]{.underline}
At the same time, China -- our principal adversary -- is expanding its
footprint in the region. [In my view, this makes Indian engagement in
the Arctic essential.]{.underline}

India should be present to understand and navigate these dynamics. It
could, I believe, position itself as a bridge -- between the West and
Russia, or between the West and the broader "Global South." Later in our
conversation, we can discuss how this bridging role might be developed
in practice. But at its core, this is how I understand the geopolitics
of the Arctic: [**India needs to be engaged**, not only for
environmental or economic reasons, but also to make sense of and
influence the emerging security architecture.]{.underline}

66° North: Since you brought up China, I'd like to follow up. How do
Indian policymakers view China's growing involvement in the Arctic --
especially from a maritime standpoint? What are the main concerns?

Anurag Bisen: The concerns go beyond the maritime domain. India and
Russia share a long-standing and multifaceted relationship, but since
the imposition of Western sanctions in 2014, Russia has found itself
increasingly isolated. This isolation has pushed Moscow closer to
Beijing -- something China has capitalised on.

Take the Yamal LNG project as an example. Chinese entities such as CNPC
and the Silk Road Fund hold nearly a 30% stake. Reports suggest that
around 60% of the equipment used in the project is of Chinese origin,
and Chinese labour has been heavily involved.

From the Indian perspective, this Sino-Russian closeness is driven less
by mutual affinity and more by necessity. Many in Russia are
uncomfortable with their junior position in the relationship. There are
also longstanding Russian concerns about the Far East, which remains
sparsely populated and vulnerable to demographic and strategic pressures
from China. Historical grievances persist in Chinese strategic thinking
regarding how the borders were settled.

In contrast, India presents no such challenge to Russia. In fact, Russia
has actively courted Indian engagement. At the 2019 Eastern Economic
Forum, India was the official partner country, and Prime Minister Modi
was the chief guest. That's when India launched its "Act Far East"
policy and extended a US\$1 billion line of credit to Russia.

[India also enjoys strong bilateral relationships with other Arctic
states]{.underline}. With Canada, for instance, people of Indian origin
make up around 8% of the population. Despite a temporary diplomatic
strain under Prime Minister Trudeau, the relationship remains robust.
India has held two Nordic summits and planned a third with Norway, which
was postponed due to a terror attack in Kashmir.

"Strategic competition with China is a more important long-term
challenge for the West than the conflict with Russia. In fact, it would
not be in the West's interest to see Russia and China close ranks in an
Arctic partnership."

Strategic competition with China is a more important long-term challenge
for the West than the conflict with Russia. In fact, it would not be in
the West's interest to see Russia and China close ranks in an Arctic
partnership -- with their forces combined, the two countries would be
too strong to balance. So my argument is that Russia is being driven
into China's embrace, since it is increasingly isolated and sees no
alternative because of Western sanctions. The West should encourage
India to become Russia's Arctic alternative to China.

But to be clear, India's Arctic engagement is not driven by what China
does. We do not compete with China, nor do we replicate its methods --
be they economic inducements, coercion, or opaque investments. India's
engagement is transparent, based on national interest, and carried out
with limited resources. China's involvement in the Arctic is far ahead
of ours, but India's policy stands on its own merits.

66° North: It is interesting you raise the possibility of India as an
Arctic "alternative" to China from a Russian point of view. I've also
observed this argument in Russian writings. You recently took part in
the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk. What's your impression -- do
Russian stakeholders genuinely want deeper Arctic cooperation with
India, in part to reduce reliance on China?

Anurag Bisen: Absolutely. I can give you several examples. Over the last
ten years, nearly every India--Russia summit joint statement has
included a line welcoming India's participation in the Arctic. Despite
that, we've seen limited concrete follow-up -- likely due to a lack of
coordination on the Indian side.

But things may be shifting. [The joint statement from the 2023 summit
was the most substantive yet on Arctic cooperation]{.underline}. It
included an agreement to establish a joint working group on cooperation
along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Personally, I would have preferred
broader wording [-- **such as Arctic cooperation** in general -- but the
NSR is a start.]{.underline}

"I argue that India and Russia are natural partners in each other's
strategic theatres. The Indian Ocean is to India what the Arctic is to
Russia -- vital and deeply strategic."

Russia has also made strategic overtures. Last year, it offered India
the opportunity to build icebreakers. That was a significant signal.
China, with its dominant shipbuilding capacity, could have fulfilled
that role more efficiently. But Moscow chose to publicly offer it to
India -- perhaps to balance its over-dependence on China.

More broadly, I argue that India and Russia are natural partners in each
other's strategic theatres. The Indian Ocean is to India what the Arctic
is to Russia -- vital and deeply strategic. Neither country poses a
threat to the other in these regions. I've argued this in my writing: we
should facilitate each other's presence, rather than allow it to be
constrained by external tensions.

Russian stakeholders are clearly interested. But for this potential to
be realised, [India must bring more cohesion and follow-through to its
Arctic engagement.]{.underline}

66° North: [You've spoken about India's strong bilateral ties with all
Arctic Council states, and about its status as an observer since
2013]{.underline} -- the same year China was admitted. How does India
currently assess the state of the Arctic Council, especially in light of
the Norwegian presidency's recent efforts to revive cooperation? And
what is India's perspective on Russia's suggestions to explore
alternative governance mechanisms, perhaps under the BRICS+ format?

Anurag Bisen: Credit must be given to Norway for attempting to revive
the Arctic Council's functions. Through virtual working group meetings,
the Norwegians have managed to restore a semblance of cooperation -- but
it remains limited.

This is despite the 2017 binding agreement among Arctic states to
enhance scientific cooperation. Currently, nearly half of the INTERACT
climate monitoring stations are located in the Russian Arctic. Since
2022, the absence of Russian data has led to discrepancies. Scientists
are unsure whether these are caused by gaps in data or actual shifts due
to climate change. Either way, this impairs climate research with global
ramifications.

In my view, at the very least, [**scientific cooperation should be
restored immediately**. Even in the United States, there are now voices
calling for the resumption of this area of collaboration.]{.underline}
When Kenneth Høegh from the Danish-Greenlandic presidency visited Delhi
in May and outlined their five priorities, I asked him directly: if
Russia accounts for more of the Arctic than the other seven members
combined, how can these goals be met without its participation?

[Arctic Council cooperation should focus on **sustainable development
and climate change**,]{.underline} not be paralysed by geopolitics. If
politics cannot be kept separate, then the Council's mandate should be
revised to reflect that. But under the current charter, we should strive
to resume practical collaboration, especially scientific.

Looking ahead, if a political settlement emerges between Russia and
Ukraine -- or if a potential Trump administration pursues rapprochement
-- this could unlock renewed cooperation in the Arctic. The future of
the Council hinges significantly on U.S.--Russia relations.

["If 'what happens in the Arctic affects the entire planet,' then the
rest of the world -- especially the 'Global South' -- deserves a **more
meaningful role** in Arctic affairs."]{.underline}

[As for India, we've long prioritised the Arctic Council in our official
policy.]{.underline} But with the Council currently constrained, we've
shifted towards bilateral engagements. Since 2021, India has signed
Arctic-related agreements with Norway and Russia and is on the verge of
signing one with Finland. These are led by our National Centre for Polar
and Ocean Research (NCPOR) in Goa.

On the question of alternative governance platforms such as BRICS+: I
have a somewhat contrarian view. If, as the often-cited phrase goes,
"what happens in the Arctic affects the entire planet," then the rest of
the world -- especially the "Global South" -- deserves a more meaningful
role in Arctic affairs. I'm not advocating for territorial claims, but
rather for a more inclusive governance framework.

To illustrate, consider India's climate-linked interests. [India and
China together represent nearly half of humanity]{.underline}. One
critical issue is the monsoon. [Around 70% of India's annual rainfall
occurs between June and September.]{.underline} Nearly 60% of our
farmland is rain-fed, not irrigated, and monsoon performance is directly
tied to India's GDP and food security.

[Studies have shown a **teleconnection between Arctic climate** dynamics
and **the Indian monsoon**]{.underline}. Yet under current Arctic
Council rules, if [India wants to research this, we **must partner with
a Council member**, and we cannot contribute more than 50% of the
resources]{.underline}. But why would an Arctic state be invested in
researching the Indian monsoon? This reveals a structural limitation.

#### The plan bolsters the [Arctic ecosystem]{.underline}.

On the other hand, [Russia, a large part of whose geography lies in the
Arctic, has expectations of India **collaborating** in the region on its
**resources** and **infrastructure**]{.underline}. This aligns with
Russia's strategy to balance its dependence on China, with whom it has
intensified military presence and commercial activities in the region.
Controlling a majority of the Arctic Ocean coastline, [Russia is
leveraging this to enhance its global influence, posing a threat to
**NATO interests**, and heightening geopolitical
competition]{.underline}. India's long-standing alliance with Russia is
complex, and the Arctic adds another layer of intricacy. [While India's
**energy interests** are clear, it carries significant risks for
**long-term climate** and **economic security**]{.underline}. China's
increasing Arctic presence further complicates geopolitical balancing
and challenges efforts to conserve the Arctic.

For India, loss of Arctic sea-ice impacts the monsoons that are critical
for its agriculture. [Protecting **Arctic sea-ice** is thus
**essential** for India's goal of becoming an **economic
superpower**]{.underline}. [India, therefore, must **leverage** its
scien**tific research abilities**, per its Arctic Policy to strengthen
its **research** and **development** efforts in the region]{.underline}.
Increased [investment in scientific research and diplomatic initiatives
are crucial to highlight the Arctic's importance]{.underline} as a
global common. India should [use its position in **global forums** to
advocate for **Arctic protection** and promote **sustainable
practices**]{.underline}.

The [United States (**US**) and **India** share a vested interest in
safeguarding the Arctic]{.underline}. For India, stringent regulation of
commercial and military activities in the Arctic is crucial to avoid
further destabilising the monsoon. Similarly, the [**US** seeks to
prevent **exacerbating climate** damage while strategically **countering
Russia** by **limiting** its **influence** in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[**Arctic cooperation** offers **mutual benefits** for both nations,
provided a **science-based approach** cantered on climate protection
shapes their **bilateral strategy**]{.underline}. [Collaborating with
the US on climate and scientific research in the Arctic can help
**balance** these **interests**]{.underline}. India's historical ties to
the Arctic, coupled with its growing economic and geopolitical clout,
provide a strong foundation for such efforts.

India's ability to navigate historical divides and align positions among
the Global South [holds the potential to forge a **united approach** in
safeguarding the crucial **Arctic ecosystem**]{.underline}. India must
[help **pivot away** from **further exploitation** of the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, which will disproportionately impact the Global
South.

#### Arctic sustainability collapse risks global ecological collapse and extinction

Michael **Huft,** 20**23** --PhD in Biology from the University of
Michigan, JD from Northwestern, BS in Physics from Notre Dame, editor of
the Great Lakes Botanist "BOOK REVIEW" THE GREAT LAKES BOTANIST,

Though small or local ecosystems may collapse from time to time from a
variety of causes, [scientists are becoming aware of the possibility
of]{.underline} large-scale, or even [global, ecosystem collapse as a
consequence of global warming,]{.underline} particularly under a Plan A
scenario. Perhaps the [most obvious]{.underline} such event [would be
the collapse of the oceanic ecosystem resulting from ocean
acidification]{.underline}, which would destroy coral reefs and prevent
the formation of the calcium skeletons or exoskeletons of many marine
animals, but most pertinently of foraminifera, which are the base of
many oceanic food chains. Attention has also focused on the possibility
of more extensive collapse on land. A 2004 study (Thomas et al. 2004)
found that under a business as usual scenario, 15--[37 percent of land
animal and plant species would be committed to extinction by
2050]{.underline}. Griffin notes that a 2007 study concluded that the
[plankton, edible fish, bees, and topsoil, all of them **essential to
human survival**, are in severe danger]{.underline} and their loss must
be averted. A comparative study of historical extinction rates with
those of today concluded that species are now disappearing at a rate
1,000 times that of the past and that we are facing a major extinction
crisis comparable to the end of Cretaceous extinction event that spelled
the end of the dinosaurs and large numbers of other species (Pimm et al.
2014).

An important study discussed by Griffin attempts to recognize [planetary
boundaries that must be observed to prevent global ecosystem
collapse]{.underline} (Rockström et al. 2009). The idea is that as the
earth transitions from the Holocene (the geological epoch that began
following the latest glacial era, about 10,000 years ago) to the
Anthropocene (a proposed geological epoch that began at the dawn of the
industrial revolution or later in recognition of the substantial human
im- pact on the earth's geology and biosphere, including climate
change), many of the conditions that permit the maintenance of the
global ecosystem are being altered beyond the bounds that held sway
during the Holocene. The authors ask what the non-negotiable global
preconditions are that we need to respect in order to avoid catastrophic
environmental change on a planetary scale. They refer to the
preconditions as thresholds---a concept that is similar to the tipping
points we have already discussed with respect to irreversible changes
brought on by climate change. Transgressing one or more of these
thresholds could lead to an abrupt change in the global ecosystem. Since
we have no precise knowledge of these thresholds, in particular when, or
under what conditions, they would be triggered, the authors call for
study of the dynamics of these thresholds and the associated feedbacks
on a continental and global scale. They suggest that we agree on a set
of boundaries within which we can expect to operate safely. At one point
it was assumed that a 4°C rise in global temperatures would provide
safety for global ecosystems, but [most scientists]{.underline} later
came to [believe that no more than a 2°C rise will guarantee
safety]{.underline}. However, Rockström et al. (2009) proposed that a
safe boundary would be an increase of no more than 1.5°C. They recognize
nine planetary boundaries, of which three have already been passed.
These include atmospheric CO2 concentration and loss of biodiversity.
They urge that we do what can be done to repair or mitigate the
boundaries that have been passed and also to ensure that no further
boundaries are passed.

Griffin agrees with numerous scientists that [the release of methane
from permafrost in the Arctic poses the **greatest threat** of collapse
of the global ecosystem]{.underline}. Permafrost is the expanse of soils
in the Arctic that has been frozen since the most recent glacial period.
It contains vast amounts of carbon from dead animals and plants,
primarily in the form of methane. It is estimated that [the carbon in
the permafrost constitutes half of all the carbon stored in the earth's
soils]{.underline}. If it were all to be released, [it would
constitute]{.underline} four or [**five times** all the carbon that has
been released by human activity since 1850]{.underline}. The concern is
heightened because [the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of
the planet, which makes thawing of the permafrost, and the consequent
release of methane, even more likely.]{.underline} This is particularly
so, since most of the carbon is in the top three meters of the
permafrost. If the permafrost is on dry land, the carbon will be broken
down by oxygen-breathing bacteria and released as CO2, whereas if it is
below a wetland, it will be released as methane, which is a far more
potent greenhouse gas than CO2. It was once thought that the release of
methane from permafrost was a minor problem that would take place only

Introduction

Ever since American security analysts began to consider the impact of
global warming on international security, water---or rather, water
scarcity---has been viewed as an especially critical factor. In many
parts of the developing world, it is thought, water supplies are already
insufficient to meet societal requirements, and, by shrinking these
supplies further, climate change will cause widespread hardship, unrest,
and conflict. [This **understanding of water's centrality** in the
climate change-conflict equation continues to **underlie**]{.underline}
U.S. assessments of warming's impacts on [international
security.]{.underline} However, exactly what role water plays in this
equation has been the subject of considerable investigation over the
years.

When American security analysts first examined warming's impact on the
global security environment, they largely assumed that climate-related
water scarcities would most likely provoke conflict within nations, not
between them. As rainfall diminished, it was assumed, food production
would become more precarious, and various groups within societies,
whether defined along class, ethnic, or religious lines, would compete
for access to the available supplies; when governments proved incapable
of satisfying the mounting demands in an efficient and equitable manner,
conflict would erupt.1 [Only later did analysts look closely at the
possibility of conflicts arising between states over climate-related
water scarcities]{.underline}, typically in the context of shared river
systems--a quest that would inevitably lead them to the dangers posed by
water competition in South Asia.

The evolution of strategic thinking on water's role in precipitating
conflict can be traced through examination of some of the key documents
in the field. Serious study of the topic began in the middle of the
first decade of this century, when analysts in both the military and
intelligence communities undertook the earliest assessments of warming's
impacts on national and international security. Two seminal documents
arose from these efforts: National Security and the Threat of Climate
Change, published by the CNA Corporation (formerly the Center for Naval
Analyses) in 2007, and the National Intelligence Assessment on the
National Security Implications of Global Change to 2030, submitted to
Congress by the National Intelligence Council (NIC) in June 2008. The
2007 report, written by staff members at CNA with the assistance of a
Military Advisory Board made up of retired generals and admirals, placed
resource scarcity at the center of its analysis, coining the term
"threat multiplier" to describe warming's impact on the security
equation in poor, deeply divided societies. 2 "Many governments in Asia,
Africa, and the Middle East are already on edge in terms of their
ability to provide basic needs: Food, water, shelter, and stability," it
explained. "[Projected climate change will **exacerbate the problems**
in these regions and add to the problems of effective
governance]{.underline}." As governments fail and conflict breaks out
among competing factions, the U.S. military may be called upon to
deliver aid and restore stability. "Weakened and failing governments,"
the report stated, "foster the conditions for internal strife \[and\]
extremism." Accordingly, "the U.S. may be drawn more frequently into
these situations to help to provide relief, rescue, and logistics, or to
stabilize conditions before conflicts arise."3

The 2007 CNA report had a significant impression on U.S. military
thinking at the time, both because of the prestige of CNA's Military
Advisory Board---prominent members included General Gordon R. Sullivan,
former Chief of Staff of the Army, and General Anthony C. Zinni, former
commander of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM)---and because its
conclusions accorded well with the observations of many officers who had
been deployed in food and water scarce areas of Asia, Africa, and/or the
Middle East. For many of them, the notion of climate change as a "threat
multiplier," adding to the resource stresses they were already
witnessing, made perfect sense.4

While the CNA Corporation was undertaking its study, elements of the
U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), spearheaded by the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the NIC, were conducting their own
investigation of warming's impact on global security. This resulted in
the publication of a National Intelligence Assessment on the topic and a
summary report of its contents by Dr. Thomas Fingar, the NIC's Deputy
Director, before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on
June 25, 2008. Like the authors of the CNA report, Fingar identified
climate-induced resource scarcity as the most worrisome outcome of
global warming. As global temperatures rise and rainfall declines in
many areas, he testified, global warming will devastate agriculture in
many areas of the developing world, resulting in widespread misery and
discontent:

For many developing countries, reduced agriculture output can be
devastating as agriculture represents a large share of their economy, a
majority of their populations rely on subsistence farming, and their
governments and people have less adaptive capacity.5

When governments fail to overcome these challenges in a fair and
effective manner, he added, unrest and conflict could erupt,
"particularly over access to increasingly scarce water resources."6

This perception of resource scarcity (especially of water) as the
pivotal impact of climate change on international security, combined
with the threat multiplier concept, was gradually absorbed into official
U.S. military doctrine. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), in its
Quadrennial Defense Review Report (QDR) for 2010, alluded to the 2008
National Intelligence Assessment (NIA) by noting that "assessments
conducted by the intelligence community indicate that climate change
could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world," including
by "contribut\[ing\] to food and water scarcity and through "the further
weakening of fragile governments."7 It also borrowed from the CNA's
assessment by stating, "While climate change alone does not cause
conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict,
putting a burden on governments around the world."8 On this basis, the
Armed Services were instructed to work with the militaries of friendly
nations to enhance their capacity to respond to extreme climate events.9

In the years that followed, this summary of warming's impacts on global
security permeated official U.S. thinking on the subject. "Climate
change is an urgent and growing threat to our national security," the
DoD told Congress in a 2015 memorandum, "contributing to increased
natural disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources
such as food and water."10 For example, similar statements were included
in speeches by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel in 2013 and 2014,11 and
in an October 2015 speech at Stanford University by National Security
Advisor Susan E. Rice.12

In almost all such statements, [water--or rather, water scarcity--was
viewed as a **pivotal factor** in identifying countries' **vulnerability
to the effects of climate change**, posing a significant threat of
instability and conflict]{.underline}. Typically, moreover, military
analysts assumed that any such conflict arising from water security
would occur within states, presumably between competing factions and
ethnic groups. This was widely seen to be the case, for example, in
fighting between pastoralists and farmers in the Sahel region of Africa,
where recurring drought has significantly diminished water supplies for
local groups, exacerbating long-simmering tensions among them. 13 "The
genocide in Darfur began, in part, as a drought-driven conflict," Rice
asserted in her 2015 Stanford speech. "In Nigeria, prolonged drought
contributed to the instability and dissatisfaction that Boko Haram
exploits."14

The Prospect of Interstate Conflict over Water

[Water scarcity continues to]{.underline} figure in DoD studies of the
[link]{.underline}s between [climate change and conflict]{.underline},
but analysts' assumption that [fighting over scarce water supplies would
be confined to intrastate conflict has been **challenged over time.**
This]{.underline} was first evident in an Intelligence Community
Assessment (ICA) prepared by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in
2012. Released to the public as Global Water Security, the 2012 ICA
reaffirmed the centrality of water in international security affairs but
raised the specter of water conflicts arising between as well as within
states. As in earlier IC reports, the 2012 ICA concluded that water
issues[, in **combination with pre-existing factors** like poverty and
social discord, could contribute to internal unrest and **state
failure**.15 However, the report went on to consider a range of
circumstances in which such issues could also provoke tensions and
conflict between states.]{.underline}

[Interstate conflict over water might occur]{.underline}, the ICA
indicated, [when several states **rely on a shared river system** for
much of their water supply]{.underline} and one or more of the riparian
states sought to maximize the river's flow for their own benefit at the
expense of other states in the basin, amplifying any scarcities already
present there. "We judge that [as water shortages become **more acute
beyond the next ten years**, water in shared basins will increasingly be
used as leverage]{.underline}," the ICA stated. An upstream state
enjoying superior control over a river's flow might exploit its
advantage, say, to extract advantage in international negotiations or to
attract international aid for infrastructure projects. As the ICA
further noted, "...we assess that states will also use their inherent
ability to construct and support major water projects to obtain regional
influence or preserve their water interests."16

[The utilization of a state's superior position in a shared river system
to **extract political or economic advantage** can prove especially
destabilizing]{.underline}, the ICA suggested, when weaker states in the
system (typically the downstream countries) are especially vulnerable to
water scarcity because of long-standing social, economic, and political
conditions. Without identifying any particular states by name, the study
suggested that this could occur when downstream states suffer from
endemic corruption, poor water management practices, and systemic
favoritism when it comes to the allocation of scarce water supplies. In
such cases, any reduction in the flow of water by an upstream country
could easily combine with internal factors in a downstream country to
provoke widespread unrest and conflict. "Water shortages, and government
failures to manage them, are likely to lead to social disruptions,
pressure on national and local leaders, and potentially political
instability," the report noted.17

Although most discussion of the climate and water security nexus has
continued to emphasize the risk of internal conflict arising from
warming related water scarcities, some analysts have pursued the line of
inquiry introduced by the 2012 ICA, focusing on interstate tensions
arising within shared river basins. This was a prominent theme, for
example, of a 2013 study conducted by the National Research Council
(NRC) on behalf of the IC. Entitled Climate and Social Stress:
Implications for Security Analysis, the 2013 NRC report sought to better
identify the links between global warming, pre-existing social
vulnerabilities, and the likelihood of conflict. While it echoed earlier
studies by the CNA and NIC in [identifying internal factors like
poverty, ethnic discord, and governmental ineptitude as **likely
pre-conditions for climate-related conflict**]{.underline}, it also
examined dangers arising from dependence on shared river systems,
especially in cases where cooperation among the riparian powers in
managing the system is limited and global warming is expected to reduce
future water flows.18

For the NRC, [the **river systems of greatest concern** in this respect
were those that originate in the **Himalayan Mountains** and depend, for
a significant share of the annual flow, on meltwater from the Himalayan
glaciers]{.underline}. These glaciers are [an important source of
meltwater for many of Asia's major rivers]{.underline}, including the
Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Klare: Climate Change and Interstate
Conflict in South Asia Mekong Rivers. [These rivers **originate** in
China but travel through India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Laos,
Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam]{.underline}-- countries with a combined
population of over 3.4 billion people, or approximately [44 percent of
the world's total population]{.underline}.19 A large share of the
population in these countries depends on agriculture for its livelihood,
so [ensuring access to **adequate supplies of water is a prime local and
national priority**. During the monsoon season, heavy rains provide
these rivers with abundant water, but during dry seasons they are
**dependent on glacial meltwater**--and, with the rise in global
temperatures, the Himalayan glaciers are melting, jeopardizing future
water availability in these river basins. Given a **history of ethnic
and social discord** within many of these countries and long-standing
tensions among them, analysts fear that such shortages could aggravate
both internal and external tensions and **ignite interstate as well as
intrastate conflict**]{.underline}.20

As was the case of previous IC-initiated studies, the authors of the
2013 NRC report were reluctant to identify specific countries in their
findings, referring again to "countries of security concern" or other
such euphemisms. However, they did select one of these countries in
particular: Pakistan. They chose that country for special analysis, the
report indicated, because "[**Pakistan presents a clear example** of a
country where social dynamics and susceptibility to harm from climate
events combine to create a potentially unstable
situation]{.underline}."21 Pakistan was said to suffer from multiple
risk factors: Its economy is largely dependent on agriculture; much of
the water used for irrigation purposes comes from just one source, the
Indus River; [control over the allocation of irrigation waters is often
**exercised by privileged elites**]{.underline}, leaving millions of
Pakistanis vulnerable to water shortages; and much of the [water flowing
into the Indus comes from China or from tributaries originating in
India, leaving Pakistan in an **unfavorable (downstream) position** in
the system]{.underline}. These conditions have led, in the past, to
internal squabbles over water rights and to tensions with India over
control of the Indus; now, with the [likelihood of diminished meltwater
from the Himalayan glaciers, the **risk of water scarcity** triggering
violent conflict of one sort or another **becomes that much
greater**.]{.underline}22

Pakistan, the Indus, and U.S. Security

There is no doubt that Pakistan is considered by U.S. security analysts
as a "state important to U.S. national security interests," the term
used by the Defense Intelligence Agency to describe countries of concern
in the 2012 ICA on water. Not only is Pakistan a critical--if not always
wholehearted-- partner in the global war on terror, but it also
possesses a substantial arsenal of nuclear weapons whose security is a
matter of enormous concern to American leaders. 23 Should those
munitions wind up with rogue elements of the Pakistani military (some of
whose members are believed to maintain clandestine links to radical
Islamic organizations), or even worse, should Pakistan descend into
civil war and the weapons fall into untrustworthy or hostile hands, the
safety of India and other US allies--as well as of American forces
deployed in the region--would be at grave risk.24 Ensuring Pakistan's
stability therefore, has long been a major U.S. security objective,
prompting regular deliveries of American arms and other military aid.
Yet, despite billions of dollars in American aid, Pakistan remains
vulnerable to social and ethnic internal strife.25

As noted, [farming is the principal economic activity in Pakistan, and
**ensuring access to water** is an overarching public and government
concern.]{.underline} This means, above all, managing the use of the
Indus--the country's main source of water for irrigation and its major
source of power for electricity generation. Pakistan's rising population
and growing cities, with their rings of factories, are placing an
immense strain on the Indus, leading to competition between farmers,
industrialists, and urban consumers. With water and power shortages
becoming an increasingly frequent aspect of daily life, public
protests--sometimes turning violent-- have erupted across the country.
In one particularly intense bout of rioting, following a prolonged power
outage in June 2012, protestors burned trains, blocked roads, looted
shops, and damaged banks and gas stations.26

[However bad things might be in Pakistan today, climate change is likely
to make conditions **far worse in the years ahead**. Prolonged droughts,
climate scientists believe, will occur with increasing regularity,
posing a **severe threat** to the nation's agricultural sector and
further reducing the supply of hydroelectric power.]{.underline} At the
same time, warming is expected to increase the intensity of monsoon
downpours, resulting in massive flooding (as occurred in 2010) and the
loss of valuable topsoil, further adding to Pakistan's woes. As the
Himalayan glaciers melt, moreover, water flow through the Indus will
diminish. 27 With the competition for land and water resources bound to
increase and with Pakistan already divided along ethnic and religious
lines, widespread civil strife will become ever more likely, possibly
jeopardizing the survival of the state.

It is [impossible to predict exactly how the United States might respond
to a systemic breakdown of state governance in Pakistan. One thing is
clear, however: **At the earliest sign that the country's nuclear
weapons are at risk of falling into the hands of hostile parties, the
American military would respond with decisive force**.]{.underline} In
fact, research conducted by the nonpartisan Nuclear Threat Initiative
(NTI) has revealed that the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and
specialized Army units have been training for such contingencies for
some time and have deployed all the necessary gear to the region. In the
event of a coup or crisis, the NTI revealed, "[U.S. forces would rush
into the country, crossing borders, rappelling down from helicopters,
and parachuting out of airplanes, so they can secure known or suspected
nuclear-storage sites]{.underline}." Recognizing that any such actions
by American forces could trigger widespread resistance by the Pakistani
army and/or various jihadist groups, the U.S. Central Command, which has
authority over all American forces in the region, has developed plans
for backing up JSOC personnel with full-scale military support.28

Another scenario that has some analysts worried is the possibility that
a time of [sharply reduced water flow through the Indus will coincide
with efforts by India to **exploit its advantageous position** as the
**upper riparian** on three key tributaries of the
Indus]{.underline}--the Ravi, the Beas, and the Sutlej--to divert water
for its own use[, thereby depriving downstream Pakistan of vital
supplies and provoking a war between these two countries]{.underline}.
India was granted control over the three tributaries under the Indus
Water Treaty of 1960, and various Indian leaders have threatened at
times to dam the rivers or otherwise reduce their flow into Pakistan as
a reprisal for Pakistani attacks on Indian bases in the disputed
territory of Kashmir (through which the tributaries flow); this, in
turn, has provoked counterthreats from Pakistani leaders.29 What
analysts fear most, in such a situation, is [that India, possessing
superior conventional forces, would overpower Pakistan's equivalent
armies]{.underline}, [leading Pakistan's leaders to order **the use of
nuclear weapons against India**, igniting a regional nuclear
war.]{.underline} Such a conflict, scientists have calculated, would
result in 50 to 125 million fatalities, and produce a dust cloud
covering much of the Earth, decimating global agriculture--an outcome
with enormous implications for American national security.30

China, India, and the Brahmaputra River

[The potential for interstate conflict--even **nuclear conflict**--over
shared water supplies arises in the case of another major river at risk
from climate change:]{.underline} The Brahmaputra, which originates in
China and traverses much of northeastern India before merging with the
Ganges in Bangladesh and emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The
fifth-largest river in the world by volume of water flow, the
Brahmaputra starts on the northern slopes of the Himalayas and flows
easterly across the southern Tibetan plateau (where it is known as the
Yarlung Tsangpo) before making a nearly 180-degree turn and crossing
into the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh; from there, it flows in a
southwesterly direction towards its confluence with the Ganges and
thence its exit into the Bay of Bengal. For the Chinese, the Brahmaputra
is an important engine of hydroelectric power; they have already
installed one dam on the river, at Zangmu, and have announced plans for
at least three more. [For the Indians, it is a **valuable source of
irrigation water,** especially in agriculture-dependent regions of the
northeast. Leaders of both countries are **fully aware of their
counterparts' interests and concerns** over the river but have made
**little effort to reach a mutual understanding**--let alone any formal
agreements--regarding its future development]{.underline}.31

Several factors make the future status of the Brahmaputra a matter of
deep concern to security analysts. To begin with, the river enters India
through the state of Arunachal Pradesh, an area of northeastern India
abutting Tibet that is claimed by both countries. Beijing insists that
this region was once part of the kingdom of Tibet, and so belongs to
China; New Delhi claims it is a legitimate part of India under a 1914
treaty between Tibet and Great Britain. The two sides fought a war here
in 1962, with India suffering significant battlefield setbacks but China
agreeing to restore the status quo ante. The countries have not been
able to resolve the ownership dispute in subsequent years, despite
intermittent negotiations, and both continue to maintain substantial
military forces in the region. To this day, discord over Arunachal
Pradesh remains a continuing source of friction in Sino-Indian relations
and a potential spark for violent conflict.32

Another potential source of friction between China and India arises from
Chinese plans (or rumors of such plans) to divert water from the upper
Brahmaputra and funnel it via a series of tunnels and canals to
northeastern China, where existing supplies are hugely inadequate.33
While dismissed by many Chinese experts as overly ambitious and costly,
the notion of diverting water from the Brahmaputra has generated
considerable anxiety in India, [where experts fear that the resulting
decline in water flow into the Indian section of the river would
**threaten agricultural productivity**]{.underline}. Given the
centrality of farming in the Indian economy and political system, [any
Chinese move to proceed with such a diversion project could lead to
**increased tension** between the two countries.]{.underline} 34

Few analysts believe that a Sino-Indian conflict over the Brahmaputra is
likely in the years immediately ahead. Both countries have strong
motives for maintaining friendly--if not necessarily, warm--relations
between them, and water issues have not yet dominated the bilateral
agenda. This, however, is where global warming enters the picture. The
Brahmaputra, like the Indus, [draws much of its flow during dry seasons
from the **melting of Himalayan glaciers**--and these, as has already
been noted, are melting as a result of climate change, and could
**eventually disappear**.]{.underline} For both China and India, [the
melting of the Himalayan glaciers will have momentous
consequences]{.underline}. Given the Brahmaputra's critical importance
to agriculture and economic activity in both countries, [any significant
**longterm decline** in its flow would be highly disruptive, causing
**widespread hardship and social unrest**.]{.underline} 35

[Under these more stressful conditions, the Chinese leadership,
**desperate to provide additional supply** to China's water-starved
northeast, might be more inclined to **proceed with** **water diversion
projects**]{.underline} on the Brahmaputra and other shared river
systems.36 Coming at a time of equivalent water scarcity in India, [such
an effort is almost certain to **trigger a harsh Indian
response**.]{.underline} "The most salient climate-related point of
conflict \[between China and India\] could be China's move to divert the
upstream waters of rivers originating in the Himalayan watershed," the
NIC warned in a special report on climate change and India. "If China
was determined to move forward with such a scheme, it could become a
major element in pushing China and India towards an adversarial rather
than simply a competitive relationship. Border clashes related to
control of the rivers are not out of the question."37

Any conflict between China and India over the waters of the Brahmaputra,
should one occur, is most likely to remain a localized affair, without
provoking a full-scale mobilization of forces on both sides. During the
1962 war over Arunachal Pradesh, Chinese army troops engaged their
Indian counterparts in disputed areas along the border, but neither side
escalated to large-scale combat. However, [once fighting breaks out, it
is impossible to predict the succeeding chain of events, and **any
outcome is conceivable**]{.underline}. [A minor skirmish along the
Indo-Chinese border might not be a cause for alarm in the United States,
but a larger war between those two countries undoubtedly would
be.]{.underline} Both are armed with nuclear weapons, and Washington
views India as a strategic counterweight to China.[38 A crushing defeat
of India would be viewed as a potential threat to American national
interests and might conceivably **precipitate U.S. military
intervention.**]{.underline} Where that might lead is anyone's guess,
but the mere possibility of such combat has made this scenario a matter
of deep concern for security analysts in Washington.39

#### Understanding monsoons prevents food insecurity.

Shravan **Prabhu**, 5-27-20**24**, \"Monsoons are changing in India ---
here's how to climate-proof the economy,\" No Publication,
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01517-3, accessed 7.1.2025

India's monsoon season is approaching, and much of the country is
experiencing a heatwave. Worse weather, including floods and cyclones,
might follow. The India Meteorological Department has forecast "above
normal" monsoon rainfall this year. India is holding general elections,
and dealing with the intensifying impacts of climate change must be at
the top of the incoming government's agenda. **[Understanding monsoon
rainfall is crucial to both people and the economy. Last year, India had
significant losses in wheat yields owing to untimely heavy
rains]{.underline}**.

As a data scientist who, with my colleagues, has dissected 40 years of
rainfall data across more than 4,500 Indian sub-districts (tehsils), I
have seen changes in how and where monsoon rains fall. **[Monsoons
---]{.underline}** whose name comes from the Arabic word mausim, meaning
season --- **[are periodic changes in wind direction]{.underline}**.
Typically, between June and September, **[the Indian subcontinent
experiences heavy rains during the southwest monsoon, caused by moist
winds drawn up from oceans in the southwest]{.underline}**. From October
to December, during the northeast monsoon, air flowing from the
northeast triggers rains in southern India.

Grand plan to drought-proof India could reduce rainfall

In January, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a
public-policy research institution in New Delhi where I work, published
its report detailing how monsoons are becoming more erratic across
India. Even adjacent tehsils are seeing different trends in rainfall ---
hindering grass-roots preparedness at local levels.

Many tehsils in historically arid states, such as Rajasthan, Gujarat and
central Maharashtra, experienced 10--30% more southwest-monsoon rains in
the past ten years (2012--22) than during the three preceding decades
(1982--2011). Key sectors, such as agriculture and water management,
have been affected. By contrast, around 11% of Indian tehsils have seen
a decrease in southwest-monsoon rainfall of more than 10%. Most lie in
the agriculturally important Indo-Gangetic plains, the fragile Indian
Himalayan region (home to a high number of endemic plant species) and
the northeastern states, where some of the world's wettest places are
found.

Over the past two decades, Indian governments have invested in
weather-forecasting systems and developed national and state-level
climate-action plans. These have been helpful. But as the impacts of
climate change worsen, more action is needed. **[It is time to combine a
policy push, high-quality research and granular risk assessment to build
resilience against increasingly erratic rainfall
patterns.]{.underline}**

How a warming Pacific Ocean and climate change will impact agriculture

First, decentralize. India is a vast country with six major climatic
zones. The national government has mandated that all states and union
territories should assess climate risks and develop mitigation and
adaptation strategies for the rest of the decade. All 766 Indian
districts should do the same, on the basis of **[microclimatic changes
in monsoon patterns and socio-economic data]{.underline}**; these plans
should **[address crop insurance, power supplies and groundwater
quality]{.underline}**, for example. This year, the CEEW has supported
Thane, a coastal city in Maharashtra, in developing its first
risk-informed heat action plan. This framework can serve as a model for
others.

Second, strengthen farming. **[Agriculture and related sectors are the
biggest employers in the Indian economy, and they contributed 18% of the
country's gross domestic product in 2022--23. Government responses to
crop losses must move past just relief and compensation.]{.underline}**
Instead, farmers' ability to cope must be bolstered, for example by
adjusting crop growth and harvest phases, relying on
**[climate-resilient seeds and updating crop calendars]{.underline}**,
which **[are developed jointly by agricultural and meteorological
agencies and provide farmers with weekly weather information for the
planting, sowing and harvesting periods of crops grown in their
districts.]{.underline}**

How India is battling deadly rain storms as climate change bites

These calendars must incorporate shifting monsoon patterns. Efforts are
under way in some states, including Assam, which in 2022 asked the
Indian Council of Agricultural Research, a research institute in New
Delhi, to evaluate rainfall and temperature changes and determine the
optimal approach to calendar revision. Others should follow suit.

Third, disaggregate data**[. Scientists studying the South Asian climate
must examine monsoon variability with greater granularity and map risks
and impacts in different sectors across space and time.]{.underline}**
The distribution of rainfall throughout the season is more important
than the total amount. Adaptation strategies for 2030 currently rely on
climate projections for 2050 and 2100 --- shorter-term estimates are
needed, as has been recognized by the governmental scheme Atmosphere &
Climate Research-Modelling Observing Systems & Services.

Decision makers must recognize that floods and droughts can occur in the
same district, in the same season. More local data should be collected
through automated weather stations and community-science initiatives.
For example, more than 200 public schools in Kerala are using weather
stations to record 24-hour rain data, humidity, wind speed and
direction, in an effort to understand the microclimate.

The Indian government, at all levels, must tackle erratic monsoons and
'climate-proof' the economy. The lessons learnt could help countries in
the global south experiencing extreme rainfall and floods, from
Afghanistan to Kenya, Brazil and Indonesia.

In India in the 1960s, [**conditions** were conducive to the
**explosion** of a **mass revolution**]{.underline}: 80% of the
population was rural and a great many rural areas had been neglected by
the Nehruvian economic development model, based on coerced, Soviet-style
industrialisation.\[5\] [Two consecutive years of drought]{.underline}
(1965-1966) further [aggravated the **agricultural** **situation** in
North India which, without the assistance of the US food **assistance
program**, might have **collapsed** into **famine**]{.underline}. The
Maoist cadres seized upon the situation, engineering their proletarian
revolution, which was born in Naxalbari, a West Bengali village, on 3
March 1967. The [same year, on 25 May, a violent revolt erupted in which
**peasants**, **labourers** and **Adivasi**]{.underline}\[6\] [assaulted
the granaries of **feudal landlords** owning land in the village of
Naxalbari]{.underline}. From its inception in Naxalbari, [the insurgency
spread very **fast** to **other villages**]{.underline},\[7\] hence its
widely used designation of the "Naxalite movement". China took the
opportunity to support the movement via the Communist Party of China's
mouthpiece, People's Daily, which in its 5 July 1967 edition called the
movement a "peal of spring thunder crashing over the land of
India".\[8\]

#### Nuclear war.

[There are **huge** nuclear security issues in India because it is prone
to **insurgent groups** and **separatist rebels**]{.underline}.
According to the Daily Mail's reports, [most of India's top nuclear
facilities are located in exceedingly **Naxal** **terrorist** struck
districts of **India**]{.underline} or in the "Red Corridor". Some of
the sensitive nuclear installations situated in this "Red Corridor" are,
Uranium Corporation Of India Limited, Talcher Heavy Water Plant,
Institute of Physics, Ceramatic Fuel Fabrication Facility, Nuclear Fuel
Complex, Seha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Atomic Minerals Directorate
and many more.

Around 90% of the Red Corridor areas are a 'No Go Zones' for the Indian
troops and Air Force. [The Naxal rebels are in **full control** and
there is **no writ** of the Indian government in these
areas]{.underline}.

The shocking aspect of Daily Mail's report is that some Indian nuclear
scientists are reportedly assisting Naxal rebels to learn to utilise and
transport uranium. On the other hand, many of India's missile facilities
are located in either the Red Corridor or in the areas controlled by
Hindu radicals and militant organisations. [There are reported cases of
the **abduction** of **nuclear scientists** from these areas, which is a
very **disturbing situation** with respect to the safety and
**security** of **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}.

[Any nuclear accident in India could have a **serious impact** on its
neighbouring countries]{.underline} and hence, the insufficient safety
and security measures are of great concern to Pakistan. Just imagine [if
a **nuc**lear weapon fell in the hands of **Indian** **terrorists**;
this could lead to an accidental **nuclear war** between **Pakistan**
and **India**]{.underline}. Likewise, an accident at a nuclear power
plant could release radiation that may not respect any borders.

#### US-India cooperation is key to counter Russia

**Times 24** \[Economic Times, \"US wants India to use its \'special
partnership\' with Russia to stop Ukraine conflict: US official\", July
10, 2024, The Economic Times,

[The United States wants India to use its \"special partnership\" with
Russia to put \"pressure\" on Moscow to stop the ongoing conflict in
Ukraine and work for a durable peace in the region]{.underline}, US
State Department spokesperson, Margaret MacLeod said.

The US official also reiterated Prime Minister Narendra [Modi\'s famous
quote \"This is not an era of war\" which the PM had told Russian
President Vladimir Putin during the SCO Summit in Bali in
2022.]{.underline}

Speaking to ANI on Tuesday, MacLeod said, \"[The US is urging all its
partners, including India to pressurise Russia for lasting peace in
Ukraine. Russia should get out of Ukraine, This is not the era of
war]{.underline}, as Prime Minister (PM Modi) has said. \"

\"[India and Russia share a very special partnership. We wish India use
this special partnership to pressurise Russia]{.underline} (against the
war)\...Russia\'s war in Ukraine is a violation of the UN Charter,\" she
added.

Being asked about how the US and the West view India\'s stand on the
Ukraine conflict, the US official said, \"It would be better if you ask
the Indian government about India\'s stand.\"

\"But from America\'s perspective, Russia is violating the sovereignty
of Ukraine. It is attacking the civilian infrastructure. Just yesterday,
we saw the attack on children\'s hospital, where there were no Ukrainian
soldiers\...this is against the UN Charter and international law,\" she
added.

Over 40 children were killed in missile strikes at a children\'s
hospital in the Ukrainian capital on Monday. Kyiv has blamed Moscow for
the attack.

Regarding the ongoing NATO Summit in Washington DC, MacLeod said the
alliance aims to discuss the vision for the next 75 years in this
meeting. She also said that announcements of relief packages for Ukraine
will be made during the summit.

\"At this NATO Summit, we are celebrating 75 years of peace, unity,
development and innovation, and will discuss on the preparations for the
next 75 years,\" the US official said.

\"Most NATO members are in Europe, right where the Russia-Ukraine war is
ongoing, because of which it is a very serious issue for them (European
NATO members)\...A big relief package for Ukraine will be announced. We
will also get an announcement by Germany for setting up a coordination
cell,\" she added.

The NATO Summit is being held from July 9-11 in Washington DC.

The summit has come at a crucial time when the Russia-Ukraine conflict,
which started in February 2022, has intensified and also when some
cracks have emerged in NATO amid scepticism among some European partners
and comments by former US President Donald Trump against the alliance.

This is also the first NATO Summit after the inclusion of two new member
states \-- Finland and Sweden.

Speaking on the USD 60 dollar price cap put on the purchase of Russian
crude oil, the US official said that the price cap has helped in
\"reducing\" Russia\'s earnings and it wants to further lessen the
resources at Moscow\'s disposal.

\"We want to want as less resources as possible to reach Russia because
it is using the same earnings to attack Ukraine. The price cap has
impacted Russia\'s earnings, but as long as it (Russia) is able to earn,
it will continue to attack Ukraine\...so we want to reduce its gains as
much as possible,\" MacLeod further said.

[Notably, despite pressure from Western countries, India has continued
to purchase crude oil from Russia under the price cap, which several
government ministers and officials have said, has helped in keeping
domestic prices of petrol and diesel stable.]{.underline}

Further, speaking on India-US ties, the US official said that the ties
between the two countries is very strong, and added that Washington
wants to strengthen its ties with New Delhi further.

\"[We see there are deep relations between India and the US, we are
engaging on so many issues\...sometimes we have differences in
perspectives, but we have a free, frank and open dialogue with each
other. We are very positive about our relationship\...our government
wants to strengthen our bilateral relationship further,\" she
said.]{.underline}

[Being asked where the India-US relations are headed as it is an
election year in the US, MacLeod said she can\'t comment on her
country\'s domestic politics but affirmed that \"historically, both
parties (Republican and Democrat) have worked to strengthen relations
with India.\"]{.underline}

Prime Minister Modi went on a state visit to the US in June last year.
Following this, President Joe Biden came to India for the G20 Summit
last year.

The Quad Summit between the two nations is also expected to be held
later this year in India. (ANI)

###  Exts. Key to Indo-Pacific Presence 

#### It gives the [U.S. strategic presence]{.underline} in the [Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.

**Sharma & Osho '25** \[Nehal and Zerin; Nehal Sharma is the Chief of

International Foundation, "Greenland, Geopolitics and Global Power
Shifts- The Run for Resources," https://www.vifindia.org/print/13423;
accessed: 6.27.25\]

Crucially, the [Indian **monsoon system**]{.underline}, the [most
**active branch** of the Asian monsoon, accounts for approximately
75--80% of India\'s annual precipitation]{.underline}. Recent research
\[21\] by the [National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR)
analyzed decadal Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) trends, revealing
**significant findings**]{.underline}.

Research has shown that [reduced sea ice in the Central Arctic leads to
more rainfall in central India due to changes in atmospheric
circulation]{.underline}. Additionally, decreasing sea ice in the
Barents-Kara Sea affects the North Atlantic-Eurasia teleconnection,
which in turn influences the timing and strength of the Indian monsoon.
Locally, the study found more rainfall in western India but less in the
northeast. This is tied to factors like shifting temperature differences
between land and sea, warming of the western Indian Ocean, and changes
in the Asian winds flowing from west to east. This highlights the
complex relationship between Arctic conditions and India's monsoon
behaviour. \[22\]

This holds immense importance for India, where rainfed agriculture
accounts for approximately 51% \[23\] of the country's farmland and
contributes nearly 40% \[23\] of total food production. Any disruptions
to the monsoon system have far-reaching implications for agricultural
productivity, food security, and the livelihoods of those dependent on
farming.

This [emerging science challenges the **conventional narrative** that
India's tropical location excludes it from discussions on polar
regions]{.underline}, highlighting the [**interconnectedness** of Arctic
changes and India's **climatic** and **economic
stability**]{.underline}.

Therefore, [it is perplexing that the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, [one of India's largest trading
partners]{.underline}, [has **no** significant **Arctic engagement**
with **India**]{.underline}. The U.S. Arctic strategy \[24\], including
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Arctic Vision
2025 \[25\], notably excludes India from its focus on bilateral
relationships. It may be [useful to consider expanding]{.underline} the
QUAD's agenda, which will not only foster [**diplomatic engagement**
with the two countries on the **Arctic** but also **align seamlessly**
with its **overarching goal** of **enhancing strategic presence** in the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}.

###  Exts. Neutrality Solves Ukraine/India Key

#### Only Indian [non-neutrality]{.underline} ensures peace in Ukraine.

**Starcevic '24** \[Seb; September 25; Breaking news reporter, BA in
International Politics; Politico, "Ukraine bets on India to help get
peace deal with Putin,"
https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-india-russia-narendra-modi-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-peace-kyiv/;
Accessed 7.5.25\]

Modi, in Kyiv\'s eyes, has come a long way in a short time.

[When he visited Moscow in July and warmly embraced Russian President
Vladimir **Putin**, the response from Kyiv was scathing]{.underline}.
Zelenskyy called the hug --- on the same day a Russian missile strike
killed dozens of Ukrainians --- "a huge disappointment and a devastating
blow to peace efforts."

[But since then, Ukraine has come to **increasingly** view
**India**]{.underline} --- the world's most populous nation, [which has
**long promoted non-alignment** in its foreign relations]{.underline}
--- [as its ideal intermediary in **dealings** with the
**Kremlin**]{.underline}.

While New Delhi has consistently refrained from condemning Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, it has spoken in support of respecting sovereignty
and territorial integrity, and ending the war. Six weeks after his
Moscow trip raised Ukrainian hackles, Modi traveled to Kyiv to meet with
Zelenskyy. He vowed to be "a friend" to Kyiv and help bring about a
peace deal.

[India may be the **only global power player** that can play the
role]{.underline} --- [or at least the only one able to credibly portray
itself as a **neutral party** to both Moscow and Kyiv]{.underline}.

Switzerland and Austria have sided with the EU in slapping sanctions on
Russia. (A peace summit at the Bürgenstock Resort in central Switzerland
in June did not have a single participant from the Kremlin, with no
Russian officials invited.) Washington and Moscow's relations are in a
deep freeze.

[Efforts to play peacemaker by countries such as **Saudi Arabia** have
fallen flat, while China has been accused of actively helping
**Moscow\'s** war effort and Zelenskyy has just this month slammed
**Brazil\'s government** for]{.underline} \"[taking **Russia's
side**]{.underline}."

[That leaves **India**]{.underline}.

\"[We are a country which can **openly speak** with the Russians about
this \[Ukrainian\]]{.underline} problem," Indian Foreign Minister
Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said during a visit to Malaysia in March. [Putin
confirmed as much earlier this month, saying he had "**trust** and
**confidence**" in India, China and Brazil]{.underline} --- all fellow
members of the BRICS group of emerging economies --- to serve as
intermediaries with Ukraine.

On a visit to Germany earlier this month, Jaishankar declared [India was
"**concerned** and **engaged**" with trying to find a way to end the
wa]{.underline}r, and confirmed "suggestions have been made" for India
to host its own peace summit. Any such talks would need to include
Russia, he added, shooting down the idea of a Swiss-style peace
conference that did not have input from the Kremlin.

Zelenskyy has long rejected any proposals that include Ukraine giving up
land and furiously lashed out at a six-point peace plan by China and
Brazil that did not mention preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity.

India was not involved in that plan.

In Berlin this month, Jaishankar did not say whether India was planning
to put forward its own peace proposal. But hopes are high in Kyiv that
New Delhi will step up in the future.

"[I can say that India is a **reliable partner** for Ukraine and it is a
global force that can influence the **dynamics** and the **course** of
**events** in the world]{.underline}," Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
Spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told POLITICO. "And we want to see India's
participation in the peace formula process as India can make a
difference."

**Office**]{.underline}, [along with Trump's **subsequent suspension**
of military aid to Ukraine, may have been a setback for Kyiv, but New

[India, because of the nature of its **diplomatic partnerships**, is one
of the **few countries** that is currently **well

Russia's war in Ukraine. [It has **warm ties** with the **United

and **long-standing partnership** with **Russia**]{.underline}.

India has never criticized Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
2022. [But New Delhi has a **strong interest** in the war coming to an
end]{.underline}. India's sluggish economy doesn't benefit, and [the
longer the war rages, the **higher** the **risk** that Russia will grow
more **dependent** on **China**]{.underline}, India's strategic
competitor. Moreover, a long conflict could wear down Moscow's capacity
to send weapons to New Delhi.

[Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has **repeatedly called** for the
**war** to **end**]{.underline}---a message that he delivered publicly
while sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a regional

###  Exts. Ukraine Goes Nuclear

#### Ukraine war goes nuclear.

**Peters '25** \[Andrea; June 10; Reporter; WSWS, "Ukraine war
escalates, as Russia warns of nuclear war should peace talks fail,"
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/06/11/mtgq-j11.html; Accessed

[Russia has launched a series of **large-scale air attacks** over the
last several da]{.underline}ys, [in response to]{.underline} Kiev's
recent attempt to blow up the bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian
mainland and [assaults on airfields thousands of miles away from the
**Russian-Ukrainian** **border** and deep in **Moscow's
territory**]{.underline}.

Since Sunday night, more than 800 drones and missiles have been launched
against Ukraine. While Kiev claims most were shot down, there were
strikes across the country, including in the capital city and the Dubno
airbase in the west, where American-made F-16 fighters are stationed.
Poland reported scrambling jets in western Ukraine on Sunday night in
response to the air assault.

On the ground, Russian troops have now retaken Sumy in Ukraine's
northeast, reversing gains Kiev made three years ago. Moscow also
reports that it has pushed into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in central
Ukraine. Kiev denies this, claiming Moscow is spreading "false
information." If true, this will "create new problems for Kyiv's
much-stretched forces," noted CNN in an article on Sunday.

Meanwhile, the Zelensky government is continuing its onslaught. This
past weekend, [drones damaged a Russian airfield in Nizhniy Novgorod and
a factory in Cheboksary that makes **war materiel**]{.underline},
resulting in the suspension of production at the plant. Both are located
far to the east of Moscow. On Tuesday, a chemical facility in Tula
Oblast caught fire after being hit for the second time. Flights at
airports serving Russia's first and second largest cities, Moscow and
St. Petersburg, were briefly halted that day due to drone attacks.
Bombings in Belgorod, a Russian oblast bordering Ukraine, occur daily.

In April, President Zelensky reported that his soldiers are operating on
the ground in Belgorod, a fact acknowledged at the time by unofficial
Russian sources. This is Ukraine's second incursion into Russian
territory, after Kiev's now-failed attempt to seize the region of Kursk
in 2024.

[The **escalation** of the **fighting**, sought by **NATO**, risks
instigating **nuclear war.**]{.underline} [The European powers are
**vehemently opposed** to any America-led **peace deal** between Ukraine
and Russia]{.underline}, [which threatens to **shatter** the
**Euro-Atlantic alliance**]{.underline} and is likely to be made at
their expense.

At the same time, the Trump administration is in no way encumbered by
the president's promises to end the war "within 24 hours" of taking
office. It has its own calculations as to what is profitable for US
imperialism and what concessions, if any, it is willing to make on the
Russian front in order that it may concentrate on the Chinese one.
Despite overtures to Moscow, the White House may retreat from efforts to
settle the conflict.

On June 5, after a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump
declared that [Ukraine and Russia were akin to]{.underline} "[two young
children **fighting** like **crazy**]{.underline}." "You're better off
letting them fight for a while and then pulling them apart," he said.
Delivered in his usual crude style, the White House leader made clear
that he sees a strategic advantage in allowing Russia and Ukraine to
exhaust themselves through war.

Trump simultaneously threatened to punish both Kiev and Moscow with
sanctions. "We'll be very, very, very tough, and it could be on both
countries to be honest," he said.

Shortly before Trump issued these statements, Russia and Ukraine met in
Turkey for a second round of US-brokered peace talks. The discussion
lasted an hour and resulted in an agreement to exchange prisoners and
war dead but nothing else. After delays over the weekend, the process
began on Monday.

While some news sources say that the number of people, alive or not,
changing hands is unknown, the British Guardian reported that 1,200
members of each side's armed forces are returning home, namely those
wounded and under the age of 25. Russian presidential aide Vladimir
Medinsky told the press on Monday that his country is prepared to return
6,000 soldiers' bodies to Ukraine, but that the Zelensky government is
refusing to accept them because it does not want to acknowledge the
scale of its losses.

With his military facing a catastrophic situation and his far-right
government fearing the prospect of a peace deal worked out at their
expense, Zelensky vacillates between obsequiousness before Washington
and pressing it for more guns.

On June 8, he gave an interview to ABC News in which he went back and
forth between implying that the White House was undermining the war
effort, demanding an expansion of the conflict with American backing and
declaring that Ukraine was ready to lay down its arms.

In his exchange with ABC's Martha Raddatz, Zelensky lamented that the US
has reneged on its promise to send Kiev 20,000 missiles capable of
taking out Russian drones. The White House sent them to the Middle East
instead, he said.

Zelensky insisted that this was a mistake. "We can only counter" Russia
"with force," he declared. "We can stop \[Russia\] in their tracks, and
probably then they will be ready for some kind of diplomacy and talks.
We have to prepare such plans, and we are not stopping.

"I am convinced that the president of the United States has all the
powers and enough leverage to step up," he said, insisting that Trump
must exert "hard pressure."

Zelensky further claimed that Kiev was prepared to lay down all its
arms, if Moscow did as well. Last week's bombing run on Russian
airfields makes clear, however, that Ukraine and, above all, NATO and
the US are prepared to risk nuclear war should they not get what they
want.

The same day that Zelensky gave his interview, several representatives
of the Russian government outlined their country's position. Speaking of
Moscow's recent territorial gains in central Ukraine, Deputy Chairman of
the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said that his country's
armed forces initiated their latest offensive after Ukraine refused to
recognize Russian territorial control during the recent peace talks.

"[Anyone who does not want to acknowledge the realities of war in
negotiations will receive **new realities** on the ground]{.underline},"
Medvedev threatened on the social media outlet Telegram.

At the same time, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told
the press that peace depended on "practical steps aimed at eliminating
the root causes of the fundamental contradictions between us in the area
of security," by which he meant halting the expansion of NATO.

Without this, he said, "[it is **simply impossible** to resolve the
current conflict in **the Euro-Atlantic region**]{.underline}."

According to Reuters, Moscow is demanding a written commitment that NATO
will not extend itself further east.

Identifying the United States and NATO as instigators of the war,
Ryabkov said the ceasefire talks test "the seriousness of Washington's
intentions to straighten out our relations." He further told TASS news
agency that the war would not stop until NATO troops are pulled out of
the Baltic.

In a demonstration, however, of its position, in late May, Germany
deployed 4,800 soldiers to the Baltic country of Lithuania on a
permanent mission, the first of its kind since the World War II.

The implications of what would happen should a peace deal fail to take
into account Moscow's central demand were made clear the very same day
by Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's lead negotiator in the talks with
Ukraine.

"If you stop the conflict along the front line and don't agree on a real
peace, just make some kind of truce, then it will be---you know, such a
disputed region between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Karabakh---then this
region will turn into a huge Karabakh. After some time, [Ukraine
together with **NATO**, with allies will join **NATO**, will try to
reclaim it, and it will be the **end of the** **planet**, it will be a
**nuclear war**]{.underline}," Medinsky said.

In a Kremlin briefing likewise delivered on June 9, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia [reserves the right to deploy
**short- and medium-range missiles** if **NATO's** **aggression** on its
borders does **not** **halt**]{.underline}.

Russia chose India for this project as [European shipyards are

Besides, [Russia values India as a **reliable partner** and this project

will boost India\'s role in **shipbuilding**]{.underline}.

The Indian government is discussing plans with two shipbuilders \-- one
public and one private \-- to construct four non-nuclear ice-breaker
ships worth over \$750 million. This project will help Russia\'s nuclear
energy company, ROSATOM, as it looks for suitable shipyards in India.

[The Russian military shipbuilding industry is in a **critical

According to him, Russian shipbuilding is facing a number of systemic

• [critical dependence on **imported components**, in particular

• [cessation of supplies of **gas** **turbine units**]{.underline} from

[Russia chose **India** instead of China to construct **non-nuclear
icebreakers** as Moscow strives to develop the **N**orthern **S**ea
**R**oute and overcome the **difficulties** posed by Western
**sanctions**]{.underline}. This will bolster India-Russia ties and
[position India as a **major actor** in the affairs of the Arctic
region]{.underline}.

[**Indian Government** is in talks with two shipbuilders, a
**state-owned** and **another private** to build **4 non-nuclear
icebreaker** ships]{.underline} valued at more than \$750 million.

This construction program will support Russian Nuclear energy company
ROSATOM, while it searches for shipyards in India.

In 2023, Russia discussed India's proposal for joint production of
non-nuclear icebreakers in India, per Russian Minister Alexey Chekunkov.

This news came after Russian discussions with an Indian business
delegation which attended the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok.

Both nations decided to enhance cooperation in the Russian Arctic and
develop the Northern Sea Route as an important transit centre.

Russia sees the Northern Sea Route as an alternative route which will
decrease sailing times and reduce costs. Compared to the Suez Canal
route, it offers faster transit between North Europe and East Asia. By
2030, Russia plans to ship 150 million tonnes of crude oil, coal, LNG
etc through this route.

It involves deploying more than 50 icebreakers and ice-class ships and
constructing new ports, terminals and emergency response ships which
will ply this route.

Indian PM Narendra Modi met Russian President Vladimir Putin in July
2024 during his 2-day visit to Moscow where the two leaders discussed
collaborating across sectors, including shipbuilding.

This will be achieved by establishing a joint working body within the
IRIGC-TEC.

[ROSATOM and Indian partners also discussed ways to develop the
**potential** of the **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute that extends from
**Murmansk** close to the Russian border with Norway]{.underline}, to
the Bering Strait close to Alaska.

ROSATOM wants to build 4 non-nuclear icebreakers in India and the order
is being finalised. An official stated that both countries also plan on
an MOU for shipbuilding and repairs of Russian ships in Indian shipyards
along with training of Indian Seafarers in polar waters.

For this purpose, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and India's
Enso Group have partnered for joint investments of around \$225 million
for developing shipbuilding infrastructure.

Another reason why [Russia chose India is because **European shipyards**
cannot cater to the order while **Chinese**, **Korean** and **Japanese**
shipyards are **completely booked** till 2028]{.underline}. Russia also
sees India as a trustworthy partner with which it has always shared
amicable relations.

Russian delegation and ROSATOM officials reached Indian Shipyards to
assess their infrastructure and capacity. [The only concern is the type
of steel needed for **construction** and **sourcing** the engines for
the **vessels**]{.underline}.

[This project is a major milestone in Russia-India relations which will
not only **strengthen** India's position in
**shipbuilding**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, Russia is also advancing its
initiatives regarding arctic routes with China.

The Arctic, often associated with serene landscapes and wildlife, is not
just a picturesque region but a strategically important area shaped by
environmental, political, economic, and military forces. During the Cold
War, it was a battleground between the United States (US), the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve it as
a zone of cooperation.^1)^ [However, the strategic competition among the
US, Russia, and the People's Republic of China (PRC) has significantly
elevated its geopolitical importance]{.underline} in the past decade.
The [military advancements of Russia and PRC, in contrast to slower
efforts by the US and NATO, have turned the Arctic into a critical focus
for security, resource access, and control over emerging shipping
routes.]{.underline}

In 2009, global interest in the Arctic surged when the US Geological
Survey estimated the Arctic held 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil and 30 percent of the world's natural gas.^2)^ That same year, the
US hosted the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm
cooperation. When [Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, the
tone shifted from collaboration to competition]{.underline}. Russia's
tenor was not unprecedented; in 2007, Russian submarines planted a
Russian flag on the North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is
Russian."^3)^

The 2013 launch of the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region set
the stage for today's geopolitical landscape. By 2022, Russian
militarism and PRC's 'Polar Silk Road' ambitions prompted the US to
update its Arctic strategy, emphasizing military readiness,
infrastructure, and NATO collaboration.^4)^ The Biden administration
further prioritized investments in icebreakers, climate action, and
Indigenous involvement, striking a delicate balance between national
security and sustainable development in this increasingly contested
region.^5)^

Background

Since 2009, the US has issued several Arctic policy documents. The 2009
Arctic Region Policy Directive marked a significant shift in US
assessment by recognizing the Arctic's importance, particularly in terms
of energy and security.^6)^ The 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic
Region highlighted energy and US security, environmental preservation,
freedom of navigation, access to resources, commerce protection, and
peaceful resolution.^7)^

The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was more urgent.
Marie-Anne Coninsx, a senior fellow at the Egmont Institute and former
EU Ambassador (Arctic), noted that in prior years, US Arctic commitment
was "not high on the US Federal Agenda."^8)^ The Strategy marked a shift
in US policy, acknowledging the Arctic as a critical and addressing
challenges that had emerged since 2013. It identified four key Pillars:
security, climate change/protection, sustainable development, and
international governance.^9)^ The strategy emphasized climate change and
investing in sustainable development while increasing capabilities to
prevent threats to the US and its allies.^10)^ Furthermore, it
recognized the heightened strategic competition in the Arctic,
exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.^11)^ In 2023, US Army
General VanHerck advocated to Congress the urgent need for a focused
Arctic Strategy, enhanced domain awareness, and the creation of a
comprehensive defense framework as these challenges were being driven
further by advancing climate change and rising security challenges.^12)^

The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
[the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition]{.underline} and [directs
the DoD to]{.underline} "enhance its Arctic capabilities, [deepen
engagement with Allies and partners]{.underline}, and exercise our
forces to build readiness for operations at high latitudes."^13)^ It
highlights critical defense objectives, including protecting US
sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the Arctic's role as a
secure avenue for power projection. The 2024 Strategy includes specific
initiatives such as enhanced domain awareness; increased communication,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; better
understanding of cold-weather operations; and conducting key routine
training alongside US allies to strengthen joint capabilities.^14)^ The
strategy emphasizes cooperation with, and participation of, Arctic
nations and Indigenous communities. It underscores climate adaptation
measures. Through these efforts, the DoD seeks to maintain a
"monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic remains peaceful
while adapting to dynamic environmental and security conditions.

diverting traffic from the Suez Canal. [As access to critical resources
expands, states will shift strategies and intensify competition over the
Arctic's growing economic and military significance. This competition
has also been driven by its militarization]{.underline}.^16)^ Over the
past decade, [Russia has modernized its Arctic military bases, deployed
defense missiles, and upgraded its submarine fleet while developing
fisheries, petroleum, and mineral
extraction]{.underline}.^17)^ [Russia's restrictive NSR claims have

That said, [India's policy clearly states that any engagement with
Arctic resources must align with principles of sustainability.
Responsible exploration and exploitation is the baseline for any Indian
involvement.]{.underline}

66° North: Let's turn to aspects not included in India's Arctic policy
-- specifically, the geopolitical dimensions. The Arctic Policy avoids
addressing these issues directly, yet India is an increasingly prominent
global maritime and political actor with a well-defined security
profile. How does India view the evolving security landscape in the
Arctic, and did these developments influence its Arctic Policy, even if
not overtly?

Anurag Bisen: Before I respond, let me add a caveat: the views I express
here are my personal opinions and do not reflect the official position
of the Government of India. In fact, some of what I say may not align
with the government's current stance. That said, you're right -- the
policy deliberately steers clear of geopolitical and security concerns,
though strategic intent is subtly embedded within it.

The second-last pillar of the policy, for instance, discusses governance
and international cooperation[. **India expresses its commitment** to
**promoting peace and stability** in the Arctic in accordance with
international law and established treaties. We explicitly uphold the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and affirm our
active participation in **global climate and environmental frameworks**
relevant to the Arctic.]{.underline}

"I see the Arctic today as the site of an intensifying strategic
triangle involving the United States, Russia, and China. India's two
most important strategic partners -- Russia and the United States -- are
deeply engaged in the Arctic."

At the Arctic Circle India Forum in early May, India's External Affairs
Minister, Dr S. Jaishankar, was interviewed by Iceland's former
president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson. Asked a similar question, Dr
Jaishankar stated that India would engage with the Arctic as it does
elsewhere: by working with all stakeholders, and always in line with its
national interests.

Personally, I see the Arctic today as the site of an intensifying
strategic triangle involving the United States, Russia, and China.
[India's two **most important strategic** partners -- **Russia and the
United States** -- are deeply engaged in the Arctic. We have high-level
strategic partnerships and conduct 2+2 dialogues with both.]{.underline}
At the same time, China -- our principal adversary -- is expanding its
footprint in the region. [In my view, this makes Indian engagement in
the Arctic essential.]{.underline}

India should be present to understand and navigate these dynamics. It
could, I believe, position itself as a bridge -- between the West and
Russia, or between the West and the broader "Global South." Later in our
conversation, we can discuss how this bridging role might be developed
in practice. But at its core, this is how I understand the geopolitics
of the Arctic: [**India needs to be engaged**, not only for
environmental or economic reasons, but also to make sense of and
influence the emerging security architecture.]{.underline}

66° North: Since you brought up China, I'd like to follow up. How do
Indian policymakers view China's growing involvement in the Arctic --
especially from a maritime standpoint? What are the main concerns?

Anurag Bisen: The concerns go beyond the maritime domain. India and
Russia share a long-standing and multifaceted relationship, but since
the imposition of Western sanctions in 2014, Russia has found itself
increasingly isolated. This isolation has pushed Moscow closer to
Beijing -- something China has capitalised on.

Take the Yamal LNG project as an example. Chinese entities such as CNPC
and the Silk Road Fund hold nearly a 30% stake. Reports suggest that
around 60% of the equipment used in the project is of Chinese origin,
and Chinese labour has been heavily involved.

From the Indian perspective, this Sino-Russian closeness is driven less
by mutual affinity and more by necessity. Many in Russia are
uncomfortable with their junior position in the relationship. There are
also longstanding Russian concerns about the Far East, which remains
sparsely populated and vulnerable to demographic and strategic pressures
from China. Historical grievances persist in Chinese strategic thinking
regarding how the borders were settled.

In contrast, India presents no such challenge to Russia. In fact, Russia
has actively courted Indian engagement. At the 2019 Eastern Economic
Forum, India was the official partner country, and Prime Minister Modi
was the chief guest. That's when India launched its "Act Far East"
policy and extended a US\$1 billion line of credit to Russia.

[India also enjoys strong bilateral relationships with other Arctic
states]{.underline}. With Canada, for instance, people of Indian origin
make up around 8% of the population. Despite a temporary diplomatic
strain under Prime Minister Trudeau, the relationship remains robust.
India has held two Nordic summits and planned a third with Norway, which
was postponed due to a terror attack in Kashmir.

"Strategic competition with China is a more important long-term
challenge for the West than the conflict with Russia. In fact, it would
not be in the West's interest to see Russia and China close ranks in an
Arctic partnership."

Strategic competition with China is a more important long-term challenge
for the West than the conflict with Russia. In fact, it would not be in
the West's interest to see Russia and China close ranks in an Arctic
partnership -- with their forces combined, the two countries would be
too strong to balance. So my argument is that Russia is being driven
into China's embrace, since it is increasingly isolated and sees no
alternative because of Western sanctions. The West should encourage
India to become Russia's Arctic alternative to China.

But to be clear, India's Arctic engagement is not driven by what China
does. We do not compete with China, nor do we replicate its methods --
be they economic inducements, coercion, or opaque investments. India's
engagement is transparent, based on national interest, and carried out
with limited resources. China's involvement in the Arctic is far ahead
of ours, but India's policy stands on its own merits.

66° North: It is interesting you raise the possibility of India as an
Arctic "alternative" to China from a Russian point of view. I've also
observed this argument in Russian writings. You recently took part in
the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk. What's your impression -- do
Russian stakeholders genuinely want deeper Arctic cooperation with
India, in part to reduce reliance on China?

Anurag Bisen: Absolutely. I can give you several examples. Over the last
ten years, nearly every India--Russia summit joint statement has
included a line welcoming India's participation in the Arctic. Despite
that, we've seen limited concrete follow-up -- likely due to a lack of
coordination on the Indian side.

But things may be shifting. [The joint statement from the 2023 summit
was the most substantive yet on Arctic cooperation]{.underline}. It
included an agreement to establish a joint working group on cooperation
along the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Personally, I would have preferred
broader wording [-- **such as Arctic cooperation** in general -- but the
NSR is a start.]{.underline}

"I argue that India and Russia are natural partners in each other's
strategic theatres. The Indian Ocean is to India what the Arctic is to
Russia -- vital and deeply strategic."

Russia has also made strategic overtures. Last year, it offered India
the opportunity to build icebreakers. That was a significant signal.
China, with its dominant shipbuilding capacity, could have fulfilled
that role more efficiently. But Moscow chose to publicly offer it to
India -- perhaps to balance its over-dependence on China.

More broadly, I argue that India and Russia are natural partners in each
other's strategic theatres. The Indian Ocean is to India what the Arctic
is to Russia -- vital and deeply strategic. Neither country poses a
threat to the other in these regions. I've argued this in my writing: we
should facilitate each other's presence, rather than allow it to be
constrained by external tensions.

Russian stakeholders are clearly interested. But for this potential to
be realised, [India must bring more cohesion and follow-through to its
Arctic engagement.]{.underline}

66° North: [You've spoken about India's strong bilateral ties with all
Arctic Council states, and about its status as an observer since
2013]{.underline} -- the same year China was admitted. How does India
currently assess the state of the Arctic Council, especially in light of
the Norwegian presidency's recent efforts to revive cooperation? And
what is India's perspective on Russia's suggestions to explore
alternative governance mechanisms, perhaps under the BRICS+ format?

Anurag Bisen: Credit must be given to Norway for attempting to revive
the Arctic Council's functions. Through virtual working group meetings,
the Norwegians have managed to restore a semblance of cooperation -- but
it remains limited.

This is despite the 2017 binding agreement among Arctic states to
enhance scientific cooperation. Currently, nearly half of the INTERACT
climate monitoring stations are located in the Russian Arctic. Since
2022, the absence of Russian data has led to discrepancies. Scientists
are unsure whether these are caused by gaps in data or actual shifts due
to climate change. Either way, this impairs climate research with global
ramifications.

In my view, at the very least, [**scientific cooperation should be
restored immediately**. Even in the United States, there are now voices
calling for the resumption of this area of collaboration.]{.underline}
When Kenneth Høegh from the Danish-Greenlandic presidency visited Delhi
in May and outlined their five priorities, I asked him directly: if
Russia accounts for more of the Arctic than the other seven members
combined, how can these goals be met without its participation?

[Arctic Council cooperation should focus on **sustainable development
and climate change**,]{.underline} not be paralysed by geopolitics. If
politics cannot be kept separate, then the Council's mandate should be
revised to reflect that. But under the current charter, we should strive
to resume practical collaboration, especially scientific.

Looking ahead, if a political settlement emerges between Russia and
Ukraine -- or if a potential Trump administration pursues rapprochement
-- this could unlock renewed cooperation in the Arctic. The future of
the Council hinges significantly on U.S.--Russia relations.

["If 'what happens in the Arctic affects the entire planet,' then the
rest of the world -- especially the 'Global South' -- deserves a **more
meaningful role** in Arctic affairs."]{.underline}

[As for India, we've long prioritised the Arctic Council in our official
policy.]{.underline} But with the Council currently constrained, we've
shifted towards bilateral engagements. Since 2021, India has signed
Arctic-related agreements with Norway and Russia and is on the verge of
signing one with Finland. These are led by our National Centre for Polar
and Ocean Research (NCPOR) in Goa.

On the question of alternative governance platforms such as BRICS+: I
have a somewhat contrarian view. If, as the often-cited phrase goes,
"what happens in the Arctic affects the entire planet," then the rest of
the world -- especially the "Global South" -- deserves a more meaningful
role in Arctic affairs. I'm not advocating for territorial claims, but
rather for a more inclusive governance framework.

To illustrate, consider India's climate-linked interests. [India and
China together represent nearly half of humanity]{.underline}. One
critical issue is the monsoon. [Around 70% of India's annual rainfall
occurs between June and September.]{.underline} Nearly 60% of our
farmland is rain-fed, not irrigated, and monsoon performance is directly
tied to India's GDP and food security.

[Studies have shown a **teleconnection between Arctic climate** dynamics
and **the Indian monsoon**]{.underline}. Yet under current Arctic
Council rules, if [India wants to research this, we **must partner with
a Council member**, and we cannot contribute more than 50% of the
resources]{.underline}. But why would an Arctic state be invested in
researching the Indian monsoon? This reveals a structural limitation.

Pillar 1: [India as the **world's largest democracy**]{.underline}

[There is a strong value-based component to US engagement with
India.]{.underline} Unlike the West's relations with other countries,
such as Vietnam or Saudi Arabia, which are more transactional and rooted
in shared interests, [there is a perception that **relations with India
are rooted in shared values**]{.underline}. Central to this is an
established narrative of affinities between 'the world's oldest
democracy' and 'the world's largest democracy.' Their common democratic
heritage is also the basis for claims that India and the US are 'natural
allies'.

How [India's democracy shapes its global role and relations with the
West]{.underline}

But despite the rhetoric, their views on democracy differ. New Delhi
rarely employs democracy promotion as a foreign policy tool, meaning it
often appears out of sync with the US.

While India is certainly not the only democratic state to place
pragmatism above principle, its position on non-democratic and weak
democratic regimes is often more aligned with China than the US. This
became evident following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent removal
from power in Bangladesh, which raised concerns in New Delhi but was
lauded in Western capitals.

There have also been concerns about the state and trajectory of India's
own democracy, although its 2024 parliamentary elections have reaffirmed
India's democratic credentials to a degree.

Pillar 2: India as a bulwark against China

[**Deepening US--India relations** have also coincided with a
**deterioration in Beijing's relations** with New Delhi and Washington.
India **has become less apprehensive** about participating in US-led
bilateral and Western multilateral initiatives, where it would have
previously worried about offending China. There has also been deepening
US--India defence cooperation and a more collaborative approach to
regional security and global governance, and **both countries have
voiced concerns** about China's behaviour. For instance, India has
become **more willing to call out China's actions** in the South China
Sea and the **Taiwan Strait.**]{.underline}

India's association with the Arctic is over 100 years old; it was one of
the original high contracting parties to Svalbard (formerly Spitsbergen)
Treaty in February 1920. The first signs of serious Indian engagement in
the region surfaced between 2007 and 2008, when [India launched the
Arctic Research Program, conducted its first scientific expedition to
the Arctic and established the Himadri research station in Svalbard,
Norway]{.underline}. Over the years, India has primarily focused on
scientific research work on monsoon patterns, climate change, flora and
fauna and polar science in the Arctic.

In 2013, India gained observer status in the Arctic Council, along with
Italy, China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea. The following year,
India successfully deployed its first multi-sensor moored observatory to
the region with technical support from the Norwegian Polar Institute.
Furthermore, with the advent of a "Polar Silk Road" and China's
designation of itself as a "near Arctic state", global interests in a
new possible geopolitical game in the Arctic has grown. Consequentially,
India's policymakers have begun to pay more attention to the Arctic and
increase their engagement with Arctic countries. [One example was the
elevation of India-Denmark relations to a "Green Strategic Partnership"
in 2020, where both sides stressed the need to strengthen research
cooperation and collaborate within the framework of the Arctic Council
to fight climate change.]{.underline}

So far, [India has membership in several Arctic committees such as the
International Arctic Science Committee and the Asian Forum for Polar
Sciences. Over 25 institutions in India are pursuing Arctic
research]{.underline}. The draft version of its Arctic policy, which was
released briefly to garner public comments in January 2021, referred to
the region as a "common heritage of mankind", emphasising the scientific
angle to India's Arctic approach through think tanks, scientists and
academics and focusing on building collaborations with Arctic
institutions.

In the official Arctic policy unveiled on 17 March 2022, India stated
six tenets of its Arctic mission: science and research; climate and
environmental protection; economic and human development; transportation
and connectivity; governance and international cooperation; and national
capacity building. The previous rhetoric of a "common heritage" has been
dropped; the new text illustrated that the Arctic pursuit is guided by
the Indian philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is but one
family). Nonetheless, the idea of the Arctic as a shared space and
India's commitment to contribute to "the global good" evokes the message
of being a responsible provider to global commons, similar to its
perception of the Indo-Pacific.

As an agriculture-reliant country, Indian environmental concerns are
intertwined with the Arctic's climate change concerns, especially rising
sea levels and unpredictable monsoon patterns. The level of sea ice in
the region has been reducing by 13 per cent per decade; a further
worsening of the climate conditions and glacial melting could be
disruptive for the indigenous communities and wellbeing of the Indian
rural sector.

Crucially, the melting of Arctic ice also entails the opening of new
shipping routes which could redraw global trade flows and maritime
navigation. [India has the intention to develop the International
North-South Corridor with Moscow and link it to the Arctic to build
trans-Arctic shipping routes and decrease shipping costs.]{.underline}
Another reason for India to engage the Artic is to achieve energy
security by diversifying energy supplies. Previously, Russia -- a
leading Arctic power with vast Arctic resources -- was an important
partner to India's energy strategy. Indian firms and political
leaderships have inked agreements and memorandums of understanding with
Russian counterparts to cooperate on oil and gas projects.

However, given the present Ukraine crisis, India's cooperation with
Russia may be substantially reduced, and the development of transport
connectivity projects may have to wait. That said, the crisis
highlighted the importance of diversifying energy supplies and trade in
order to avoid overt reliance on a single external partner. [The
announcement of the official Arctic policy is also opportune in this
context, as resource exploration in the Arctic region emerges as a
priority for the Indian government.]{.underline}

The official Arctic Policy also notes "several synergies" between the
Himalayas -- the 'third pole' -- and polar studies, in which Indian
scientific expertise and experience could potentially aid scientific
advancements in the Arctic. Further, India has identified that it could
leverage its strength in digital connectivity and fill the gap of low
digital connectivity in the region by providing satellite-enabled
communications and knowledge sharing.

Considering that India is a latecomer to the Arctic, it will face a
rising great power rivalry on natural resources and military value.
[India has to be prepared for the competition with China in the
Arctic,]{.underline} as both countries increase research and expedition
efforts. [India's commitment to this distant region, coupled with its
lack of a polar vessel, is also in doubt.]{.underline} Moving forward,
India could consider inking free trade agreements and expanding its
cooperation with more Arctic states. Digital connectivity,
infrastructural development and unique research expertise from the
Himalayas are areas where India has the competence and could bring value
to the table.

[**Nuclear site** in **Naxalite** area of **influence**]{.underline}

According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative map of Indian [**nuclear**,
**biological** and **chemical** facilities, it is clear India has a lot
of chemical, biological and nuclear facilities in the Naxalite **area of
influence**]{.underline}.

India has two reactors for the production of weapons-grade plutonium
(WGP), CIRUS and Dhruva, both located in the Bhabha Atomic Research
Center (BARC) complex near Mumbai. CIRUS was shut down in 2010, but
India has plans to build a new one in Vuzag, Andhra Pradesh.

Other facilities:

Besides these [nuclear, biological, chemical, and missile facilities,
some Indian naval bases for **submarines** are located in the Naxalite
area of **influence**]{.underline}. These are

1\. Indian Western Naval Command

INS Vajrabahu is located near Mumbai in Maharashtra. This base operates
conventional (diesel-electric SSK) Indian Sindhughosh-class (Russian
Kilo Class Submarine) and Shishumar-class (German Type 209 Submarine).

2\. Indian Southern Naval Command

INS Satavahana is located in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. This base
has a Submarine School (SMS), Escape Training School (ETS), and School
of Advanced Undersea Warfare (SAUW). SAUW was established in 2006, to
train the crew of nuclear submarines (Arihant class and Russian Akula II
-- INS Chakra). There is also a training facility for
conventionalKalvari class (French Scorpene Class submarine) which is
equipped with Air Independent Propulsion System (AIP).

3\. Indian Eastern Naval Command

INS Varsha is located in Andhra Pradesh. This base will be the home of
8-12 nuclear-powered ballistic missiles and attack submarines. This is
designed solely as a nuclear submarine support base. Due to its location
close to Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC), it will have modern
nuclear support facilities.INS Kattabomman, located in Tamil Nadu, is a
Very low frequency (VLF) and Extremely low frequency (ELF) communication
center which is used to communicate with Indian submarines.

Possible scenario:

The [possibility of acquiring Chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear weapons by **terrorist actors**]{.underline} is only 1 to 2
percent, but it [is a **more realistic** threat now than in
**past**]{.underline}. Terrorist organizations are more [likely to get
or **construct**]{.underline} Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear (CBRN) weapons [if]{.underline}

1\. [They have a well-developed **alliance**]{.underline}

2\. [They have large **support** or membership]{.underline}

3\. [They have strong **economic connections**]{.underline}

In the case of the Naxalite insurgency, it is clear [that they have an
alliance with the **Communist Party of Nepal**]{.underline} -- [Maoist
(CPN-M), **Tamil insurgents**, United Liberation Front of Assam
(**ULFA**) and **Kashmiri insurgent groups** as well as Indian
Mujahideen]{.underline}. It is also reported that some [extremist Muslim
groups like Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (**JMB**) and its Indian
(**JMI**)branch have plans to cooperate with Maoists in the **anti-India
struggle**]{.underline}. JMB members were [involved in **nuclear
smuggling** in past and have **intentions** to detonate nuclear material
for their goals]{.underline}.

Maoists are also working under the Maoist umbrella organization named
"Coordination Committee of Maoist Parties and Organizations of South
Asia" (CCOMPOSA) which influences membership in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal,
Bhutan, and Bangladesh. CCOMPOSA was established on July 1, 2001, and it
aimed to coordinate Maoist organization activities throughout the world
and especially in South Asia.

It was also reported that CPN-M conducted joint operations and training
with the Communist Party of India- Maoist. In 2010, CPN-M leaders
Barshaman Pun Ananta and HaribolGajurel signed a secret agreement with
CPI-M for providing political and military to each other. CPN-M agreed
to send more trainers to India for the training of CPI-M. Indian
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) multiple times stated that both countries
provided logistics support including arms, shelter, and manpower to each
other (Ramana P. V., Linkages between Indian and Nepalese Maoists, 2010)
Maoist has 20,000 guerrillas, 50,000 common cadres and they enjoyed
strong support in not only 9 to 13 states of India but in Indian
neighboring countries. [They also have 1,500 to **2,000 crore** per year
revenue, so there are chances that **Maoists** may think to use weapons
of mass disruption (**WMD**]{.underline}) under severe circumstances.

Despite the reality that Maoist enjoyed a lot of plus points, it is
highly unlikely for Maoist to detonate real nuclear devices or construct
real ones. Conversely, there are more [chances of using the **improvised
nuclear device -- IND**]{.underline} ([as they try it in
2013]{.underline} but likely they are unsuccessful) [or radiological
dispersal device (**RDD**) by using **stolen nuclear material** or
through purchasing from **criminal gangs**]{.underline} or insider and
sabotage on nuclear facilities with insider help by Maoist guerrilla
with other anti-India movements.

There are possible ways in which Maoist may use nuclear terrorism

1\. It is [possible and more likely that **Maoists** may steal **nuclear
material** during its **transportation** due to insider help as it is
their best strategy to attack convey by first giving them a shock by the
use of mines and then gun firing]{.underline}. Then they may detonate
stealing nuclear or radiological material in a congested area or
industrial sectors like in Mumbai (Mumbai is chosen because it have the
largest number of nuclear facilities and there is some incident of
smuggling of nuclear material from Bhabha Atomic Research Center --BARC)
which have a population of more than 10 million.

2\. It is also possible and likely that somehow Maoists [may sabotage
**nuclear facilities** such as in **Kalpakkam nuclear**
power]{.underline} plant, Tamil Nadu which is considered a highly unsafe
nuclear site by British journalists. Kalpakkam has only 20,000
population, but an attack on Kalpakkam nuclear power plant resulted not
only in immediate deaths of the nearby population but also affects the
whole Tamil Nadu state, Sri Lanka, and a wide area of the Indian Ocean
but its radiations. We have an example of sabotage on the South African
nuclear facility in 2007 when two armed groups attack the Pelindaba
nuclear facility (Birch & Smith, 2015).

3\. The [Maoist helper may likely join some of the Indian nuclear power
plants as an **employee** and then **detonate conventional explosives**
inside the nuclear power plant]{.underline}. Because in one of the
Indian nuclear facilities, the Indian policeman which was assigned to
protect the nuclear site, killed many of its seniors in 2014. Similarly,
this happened in the Koeberb nuclear power plant in South Africa in
1982, where an insider placed explosives near a nuclear reactor and then
detonated them. However, the South African nuclear plant was not active
at that time (Birch & Smith, 2015).

4\. Indian Mujahideen, [**Islamic State** has an interest in a **nuclear
explosion**, these may join **Maoist** in their struggle of
**anti-India** and may buy or steal enough nuclear]{.underline} (e.g.
200 kg) [and after **making crude nuclear bomb** they may **explode it
on Mumbai**]{.underline}.

5\. Naxalite attacks change in recent years. Now [they attack large
scale,]{.underline} for example in May 2010, they attack civilian buses
by using an improvised explosive device, and in April 2010, a group of
Maoist guerrilla sieged Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and
killed 76 personnel in Chhattisgarh. Similarly, in 2013, a group of
Maoist insurgents attack Darbha valley and killed around 24 National
congress leaders state minister Mahendra Karma and Chhattisgarh Congress
chief Nand Kumar Patel. It is [clear from the Naxalite strategy that
they have **expertise in guerrilla-type operations** and this gives them
benefits as they may **enter into nuclear facilities** or Indian Naval
Submarine bases and **within 2 or 3 hours** they can construct mobile
improvised nuclear device (IND) or Dirty Bomb (RDD) and to explore it on
Indian civilian or military installment]{.underline}.

Despite these scenarios, the [Indian **Navy Submarine** bases are more
**vulnerable** and **attractive** to terrorists]{.underline}. Eastern,
North Eastern, and South-Eastern parts are facing terrorism and somehow
alliance between these terrorist groups may result in the sabotage of
Indian Naval nuclear submarine bases. However, the lack of
professionalism in the Indian Navy resulted in an incident in Indian
Nuclear submarines. In 2017, the Indian nuclear submarine Arihant
suffered major damage and has not sailed now for more than 10 months
(Peri & Joseph, 2018).

Arihant (S2) SSBN is capable of carrying four K-4 missiles and twelve
K-15 Sagarika Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM). Similarly,
the Indian nuclear submarine INS Chaka (Russian Nerpa K-152 class
submarine) an Akula class submarine on loan for 10 years from Russia for
training purposes is on the dry dock due to an undisclosed incident.
(Hundley, 2018) So, [any detonation in a **nuclear submarine** by an
insider or insurgent sympathizer may result in huge **human** and
**economic loss** to India]{.underline}.

### Impact---Himalaya Water Wars 

#### Himalaya water shortages spike conflicts between China and increase 

**King 14** (Ed, Writer for climate change news, "Climate change could
lead to China-India water conflict", 6/11/14,
<http://www.climatechangenews.com/2014/06/11/climate-change-could-lead-to-china-india-water-conflict/)>

[[Melting Himalayan glaciers]{.mark} and erratic rainfall [could
exacerbate tensions between]{.mark} central Asian countries]{.underline}
later this century, warn defence analysts in a new report. They say
[droughts or extreme rains linked to climate change could place growing
populations in [China, India]{.mark} and Pakistan under increased
stress]{.underline}. [Based on latest research by the]{.underline} UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline}), [the
study]{.underline} has been [published by]{.underline} the Global
Military Advisory Council on Climate Change and [Cambridge]{.underline}
University. "There are concerns that [tensions will increase due to
climate driven water variability in the Trans-boundary drainage systems
linked to the vast Tibetan plateau]{.underline} in central Asia, [where
rivers supply more than one billion people with water]{.underline}," it
says. Around 40% of the world's population rely on water from the
plateau for survival. It is the source of some of the world's great
rivers, including the Indus, Ganges, Irrawaddy, Mekong and Yangtze.
Speaking to RTCC, former Royal Navy Rear Admiral Neil Morisetti, who
reviewed parts of the report, said [**[water shortages would increase
the risk of instability in the region]{.underline}**.
"[If]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [glaciers melt]{.mark} as a result of the
increase in temperatures]{.underline}, after an initial burst of too
much water there's going to be a shortage, and [[it's going to compound
the problem]{.underline}]{.mark}," he said. "Clearly there is a politics
in that part of the world which needs to be taken into account when
looking at those risks." Emerging powers [[China-India troop clashes
over the]{.mark} past five [decades has caused deep mistrust]{.mark} on
both sides]{.underline}, while memories of a short but brutal war in
1962 are fresh in the minds of many older politicians. On Sunday the
Foreign Ministers of both countries met in New Delhi, seeking to explore
ways to boost economic development and cement their "strategic and
cooperative partnership", according to China's Wang Yi. [The two
emerging superpowers, along with Nepal and Pakistan **are already
involved in a race to tap the Himalayas for power**]{.underline}, with
plans for almost 400 hydropower dams in the region. Even before climate
impacts are taken into account, these are likely to cut the flow of
water into the major rivers say local experts. [Climate models suggest a
'peak meltwater' could be reached by the 2050s]{.underline}, with major
rivers losing up to 20% of their flow. The latest IPCC study into
climate science predicts that if greenhouse gas emissions rise at the
current rate, global temperatures could rise by 2.6-4.8C by 2100. Sea
levels could also rise 0.45--0.82m higher than current levels, affecting
hundreds of millions of people living along coastal areas in East,
Southeast and South Asia. "Some low-lying developing countries (e.g.
Bangladesh, Vietnam) and small island states are expected to face
unavoidable land loss and annual flooding damage," says the report.
Wider threats [[Other security]{.mark}
[implications]{.mark}]{.underline} mentioned [[include conflict over
fishing zones]{.mark} as marine life migrates into cooler
waters]{.underline}, [a [fall in food yields and a rise in]{.mark}

migration**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Indo-Sino disputes over Tibet go nuclear---no defense

**Goswami 13**---Namarate Goswami, senior fellow at the United States
Institute of Peace, a research fellow at the Institute for Defence
Studies and Analyses, "Ending Sino-Indian border dispute essential to
continued prosperity", *Global Times*,
<http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/756338.shtml>, January 16, 2013//Lee

[[China-India border tensions have been a]{.mark}n increasing cause of
[concern]{.mark}]{.underline} between two of the most vibrant economies
of Asia. While the border conflict in 1962 had occurred in the context
of two countries whose economies were weak, today the situation is quite
different. At present, [both China and India are major global
economies]{.underline}. Trade between them was negligible in 1962.
Today, it stands at \$75 billion and will soon pass the \$100-billion
mark. However[, despite growing bilateral economic
relations]{.underline}, **[the border dispute appears intractable. Why
so?]{.underline}** One need not look far for the answer. [Sino-Indian
[relations are]{.mark} still [affected by]{.mark} some thorny
divergences over [issues like]{.mark} the McMahon line and the presence
of the \"[Tibet]{.mark}an government-in-exile.\"]{.underline} These
contradictions are further complicated by border negotiations held in a
climate of Indian apprehensions that the 1962 border war between China
and India could be repeated. The apprehensions are not without merit.
The militarization of the border from both the Chinese and the Indian
side is a growing reality. [China has vastly improved its border roads
in the eastern sector bordering India, which will considerably enhance
movement by the PLA]{.underline}. On the border with India, [China has
deployed 13 Border Defense Regiments totaling around 300,000
troops.]{.underline} Six divisions of China\'s Rapid Reaction Forces are
stationed at Chengdu, a southwestern Chinese city, with 24-hour
operational readiness and supported by an airlift capability to
transport the troops to the China-India border within 48 hours. [India
too has upgraded its military presence near the eastern
border]{.underline}. A five-year expansion plan to induct 90,000 more
troops and deploy four more divisions in the eastern sector is underway.
There are 120,000 Indian troops stationed in the eastern sector,
supported by two Sukhoi-30 MKI squadrons from Tezpur in Assam. Two more
Sukhoi-30 MKI squadrons are in the process of being inducted into the
air force structure in the eastern sector. [Given this overt
militarization of the China-India border conflict]{.underline}[, [any
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the conflict dynamics there [will
have a **direct bearing on**]{.mark} **the regional strategic [stability
of Asia]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is even more plausible in
the present context as China and India emerge as two of the largest
military hardware-importing countries in the world. [Through
[the]{.mark} China-India [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, one
[[envisages]{.mark} a scenario where **[a nuclear-armed China]{.mark}**
[and **India with more than 300 nuclear weapons**,]{.mark} 3 million
standing troops, and a population of 2.3 billion people between them,
**[will fight a future war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}
]{.mark}[is dangerous for Asia and the world and [will]{.mark} severely
**[undermine]{.mark} global [peace and
prosperity.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [T]{.mark}he physical proximity of
both countries forewarns a great tragedy for their populations if war
occurs. Security analysts have argued that internal problems within
India and China would create large disincentives for conflict. However,
[despite such constraints, [wars have broken out between states based on
misunderstandings]{.mark} about each other\'s intentions.]{.underline}
Therefore, the border conflict between both countries is becoming a high
price to pay especially in the context of the rise of Asia. For Asian
stability and prosperity, both these powerful countries of Asia should
earnestly work toward resolving the border issue within the three-stage
process that has been identified. Moreover, it is pertinent that both
China and India recognizes that despite increasing economic cooperation,
political tensions over land can lead to conflict, as the example of
Europe prior to World War I clearly reflects. As a result, \$75 billion
in bilateral trade does not mean that all is well. [While competition at
a particular level is inevitable, both countries must ensure that Asia
remains peaceful if they want to continue Asia\'s path to prosperity.
Hence, managing and resolving the border issue peacefully in the next
five years is something worth seriously working for.]{.underline}

#### Water wars in the Himalayas tank Tibetan biodiversity 

Nina **Ninkovic 13**, Research Assistant, ANGO Project, holds a
doctorate and master's degree in international relations from the Geneva
School of Diplomacy and International Relations and Jean-Pierre Lehmann,
Emeritus Professor of International Political Economy at the IMD
Business School, "Tibet and 21st Century Water Wars", *the Globalist*,
<https://www.theglobalist.com/tibet-and-21st-century-water-wars/>, July
11, 2013

[[Water wars could]{.mark} largely **[destabilize]{.mark}** not just
**[the]{.mark} wider [Tibetan region]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but also
all of Asia. Based on current trends, the question is not "how" and
"why" such conflicts would arise, but "when"?

Today, countries surrounding the Tibetan Plateau in Southeast Asia, the
Indian subcontinent and, of course, China are scrambling to build
"mountains of concrete."

For now, they are addicted to dam building for the purposes of power
generation, water security, food security, livelihoods and national
identity.

To give but one example, at present the biggest source of income to the
economies of Nepal and Bhutan comes from hydropower development.

That reflects their strategic upstream location.

However, the country that has been most aggressive in this dam-building
trend has been China.

China utilizes the rivers originating upstream in the Tibetan Plateau to
build as many as 60 new dams to augment its demand for energy.

Electricity originating from these dams from the Tibetan Plateau finds
its way to China's large metropolises of Shanghai, Chongqing and
Guangzhou.

However, China's action to promote and preserve its national interest
can have severe economic, social, political and environmental
consequences in the downstream countries. These represent the most
populous regions of the world.

The [[construction of dams]{.mark} on rivers originating in the Tibetan
Plateau may seriously interrupt the water supply in downstream
countries.]{.underline}

In addition, [these constructions [pose a]{.mark} grave [threat to the
**regions' biodiversity** and]{.mark} [environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Located in a highly seismic zone[, dam building also increases risks
of]{.underline} catastrophic earthquakes affecting **[hundreds of
millions.]{.underline}**

Even though China claims to have the interests of these countries in
consideration, it remains one of the only nations without any
institutionalized water sharing agreement with downstream countries.

Lack of information sharing, transparency in building projects and data
sharing with the affected states downstream remain a constant source of
tension.

For instance, China is building three large hydropower dams on the
upstream Yarlung Tsangpo River (in Tibet, which China has renamed the
River Yarluzangbu).

Further downstream, it flows as the Brahmaputra into densely populated
areas of India and Bangladesh. The great consequences of these dams are
clear for all to see.

[These [dams]{.mark} could well [interrupt the fresh water
supply]{.mark} to northeastern India and Bangladesh.]{.underline} This
is also a region where most of the people depend on the fresh water
supply for livelihoods, agriculture and food.

India's and Bangladesh's combined population of over 1.3 billion is
already edging past China's. India alone is expected to surpass China's
population in just over a decade.

Whatever the merits of the current South-North Water Diversion Project,
China's multi-decade river rerouting plan at a cost of \$62 billion, it
will have severe environmental and water security consequences for its
neighbors.

The Chinese ambition to go forward with such projects in the Tibetan
Plateau is fueled by its "success" with the controversial Three Gorges
Dam. And it is part of the legacy left behind by its past President Hu
Jintao, a hydrological engineer by training.

Engineering pride aside, that project connected two of China's most
chronic problems --- water and Tibet.

The northward rerouting of the Brahmaputra River to join the fast drying
Yellow River with the construction of three dams in the Great Bend is
bound to have significant geopolitical ramifications well beyond the
typical issues in Sino-India relations.

Together, the pair represents around 40% of the global population.

Although India has more arable land than China, the Tibetan Plateau is
the source of origin for most Indian rivers.

There has been a long lull in Sino-Indian tensions since the 1962 war
between the two Asian giants. Today the two have "re-emerged" as
relatively amicable great powers.

[Their conflict potential has now shifted from territorial dispute to
water security]{.underline}. That is not a reason for optimism.

Countries in Southeast Asia are also affected by China's dam-building
projects. China has built dams upstream on the Mekong River, whose water
is shared downstream by Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.

Almost 60 million people in these countries depend on the Mekong River
for fresh water, food income, health and, most important, for their
national identity.

[Any [interruptions in]{.mark} their [water supply could pose]{.mark}
catastrophic [threats to food security and]{.mark} [greatly **affect
their rich biodiversity**.]{.mark} Such consequences could result in
tens of millions of environmental refugees.]{.underline}

All of which makes plain why [the Tibetan Plateau is a global strategic
epicenter. It may well determine whether the "Asian
century"]{.underline} emerges as a variation on an earlier European
theme or it traces its own peaceful trajectory.

#### Tibetan biodiversity collapse causes extinction 

**ICT 8**, The International Campaign for Tibet "The Crucial Nature of
the Tibet Environment", International Campaign for
https://www.savetibet.eu/the-crucial-nature-of-the-tibet-environment/,
2008

From [[a **global environmental** perspective]{.underline}, [few
places]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the world [are as important as
the]{.mark} **[Tibetan plateau]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Encompassing an
area of over 2.5 million square kilometers, the Tibetan plateau is the
largest and highest elevation region on the earth. With an average
elevation of 4,500 meters above sea level, Tibet is encircled by high
mountains --- the Himalaya to the south, the Karakorum in the west and
the Kunlun across the north. There are over 46,000 glaciers on the
Tibetan plateau; the largest area of ice outside the polar regions.

[Tibet]{.underline}, often referred to as the 'roof of the world' or the
['world's third pole' because it contains the biggest ice fields outside
of the Arctic and Antarctic, is threatened by melting glaciers and other
extreme weather phenomena]{.underline}. Scientists believe that the
Tibetan plateau offers an early warning of climate change and it is
therefore a critical global climate barometer. Because Tibet plays a
prominent role in the Asian monsoon system, the consequences will affect
the lives of millions of people downstream as well as those on the high
plateau.

[The plateau is the source of many of Asia's greatest
rivers]{.underline} --- the Yellow, Yangtze, Mekong, Brahmaputra, Ganges
and Indus Rivers all originate here, [and the water they provide is
critical]{.underline} to the survival of millions of people downstream.
What happens in Tibet has profound implications for hundreds of million
of people, not only in China itself, but in neighboring countries.

[A number of [biodiversity '**hotspots**]{.mark}**'** and eco-regions
[are located on the]{.mark} **Tibetan [plateau]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
With [[their]{.underline} [distinctive species,]{.underline}
]{.mark}[ecological [processes,]{.mark} and evolutionary phenomena,
these areas [are]{.mark} some of [the **most important**]{.mark} areas
[on earth]{.mark} for conserving biodiversity. The Tibetan plateau also
includes]{.underline} the most intact example of mountain rangelands in
Asia with a relatively intact vertebrate [fauna, and is one of the
largest remaining terrestrial wilderness regions left]{.underline} in
the world. [The region supports rare and endangered wildlife
species]{.underline} such as the wild yak, Tibetan wild ass, Tibetan
antelope, Tibetan argali and snow leopard. Due to extensive resource
extraction, poaching and unsustainable development, [[Tibetan
ecosystems]{.mark} and many of their species [are]{.mark} now
[endangered]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Conserving]{.underline}]{.mark}
[these animals and their habitat [is]{.mark} [an **important**
**priority** for the global community.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [Tibetan plateau is one of the earth's important grazing ecosystems,
encompassing about 1.65 million square kilo-meters of grazing
land]{.underline}. It contains the highest grasslands in the world and
with a severe climate, it is one of the world's harshest grazing
environments, yet these pastures supply forage for an estimated 12
million yaks and 30 million sheep and goats and provide livelihood for
about 5 million pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. [More than 80% of
Tibetans live in rural areas,]{.underline} and for centuries, [the
majority have sustained themselves through]{.underline} a nomadic
[herder lifestyle]{.underline}, uniquely [adapted to the harsh
conditions and fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan plateau.]{.underline}

The implementation of Chinese government policies to settle Tibetan
nomads and to resettle Tibetans in towns is now threatening the
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people and imperilling the
Tibetan landscape. These policies, based on an urban industrial model
and imposed by planners in Beijing, are counterproductive: they have
made nomads poorer and degraded Tibet's vast grasslands. Scientific
research has established that the mobility of the herds keeps the
grasslands healthy, that taking nomads off the land does not help
conserve water resources, and that herdspeople denied their livelihood
become demoralized and dependent. One of the last examples of
sustainable nomadic pastoralism on [[this planet **faces
extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline} unless this policy is
[[soon]{.mark}]{.underline} changed[.]{.underline}

[[Tibet's precious]{.mark} high-altitude [environment is]{.mark}
increasingly [endangered]{.mark}]{.underline} by Chinese government
policies. [Conserving the environment of the Tibetan plateau requires a
better understanding of its unique ecology and the collaboration of all
of the people who have a stake in the future of Tibet. [The challenge is
to balance]{.mark} the diverse [economic]{.mark}, cultural [and social
needs]{.mark} of the inhabitants of the Tibetan plateau [with]{.mark}

communities in the development process. It also requires that indigenous
knowledge is better understood, including the efficacy of many
traditional natural resource management practices.

Cooperation Balancing -- Riddle Russia,\" Riddle Russia,

[The relationship between Russia and China in the Arctic is a component
of the broader cooperation that has developed in recent
years]{.underline}. Although their views and interests do not always
align in the High North, [the need for cooperation to achieve mutual
benefits encourages them to manage their differences]{.underline}. While
access to the Arctic's sea routes and resources is a primary objective
for Beijing, Moscow's interests in the relationship are driven by the
need for investment, technology, and markets to support the development
of its economic projects in the region.

Amid Western sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014
and particularly in 2022, [Moscow views China as a critical alternative
to Western investment, technology, and markets for its Arctic projects,
as well as a partner for security objectives to counterbalance the
West.]{.underline} Previously, Russia supported the prerogative rights
of Arctic coastal states and was openly opposed to increasing the
involvement of non-Arctic countries in the region. However, [Russia now
relies on investments, technology, and markets from non 234 PRC-owned
companies [registered](https://www.striderintel.com/newsroom/shifting-ice-russias-increasing-reliance-on-the-private-sector-and-the-prc-in-the-arctic/) to operate
in Russia's Arctic territories, an [87 percent
increase](https://www.striderintel.com/newsroom/shifting-ice-russias-increasing-reliance-on-the-private-sector-and-the-prc-in-the-arctic/) compared
to the two full years from 2020 to 2021.]{.underline}

For China, [cooperation with Russia in the Arctic is driven
by geoeconomic considerations, including access to the Northern Sea
Route (NSR), resources,
and [opportunities](https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/kitay-respublika-koreya-yaponiya-v-arktike-politika-ekonomika-bezopasnost) to test
and improve technologies for extreme weather conditions]{.underline}.
Geopolitically, Beijing seeks an alternative sea route to the European
Union to reduce its dependency on the Strait of Malacca, which could
be disrupted by India---China's main regional competitor---in the event
of a military conflict, or due to uncertainties in the Suez Canal.
Additionally, China has research interests in the Arctic's environmental
changes due to climate change. Conducting joint research with Russia and
other Arctic countries is particularly important for Beijing,
as it strengthens China's involvement in the region. From Russia's
perspective, [Chinese academic institutions offer [substantial
expertise](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PEA2800/PEA2823-1/RAND_PEA2823-1.pdf) in permafrost
engineering, cultivated due to its relevance to areas like the Tibetan
Plateau.]{.underline}

However, [Russia is concerned that China's interest in Arctic resources
and the NSR could lead to a [Chinese
monopoly](https://vestnik.guu.ru/jour/article/view/995/418) over the
route,]{.underline} potentially [reducing transportation costs for China
while disadvantaging competitors]{.underline}, including Russia. Russia
also worries about China's compliance with environmental standards
in resource extraction, which is critical for the fragile Arctic
ecosystem. Since 2014, China [has
capitalized](https://vestnik.guu.ru/jour/article/view/995/418) on the
confrontation between Russia and the West, including most Western Arctic
states, by offering geopolitical, economic, and technological support
in exchange for access to [resources and transport
corridors](https://vestnik.guu.ru/jour/article/view/995/418).

Economic Projects

LNG

In the 2010s, Russia and China [achieved
a balance](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/12/lednikovyj-period-energeticheskoe-sotrudnichestvo-rossii-i-kitaya-v-arktike?lang=ru) in their
cooperation on Arctic energy projects. China gained a new source
of natural gas and its first major sales of Arctic technologies, while
Russia accessed a share of China's vast LNG market. At the same time,
Moscow has sought
to [balance](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2021/12/lednikovyj-period-energeticheskoe-sotrudnichestvo-rossii-i-kitaya-v-arktike?lang=ru) its
dependency on Beijing by attracting other foreign partners and pursuing
import substitution. Although this model of cooperation has faced
challenges since 2022, it is likely to flourish after the war ends.
[Since February 2022, Russia has partially succeeded in rerouting Arctic
oil to China and India.]{.underline} While Russia exported approximately
400,000 barrels of crude oil to Northern Europe in February 2022,
this [figure
dropped](https://www.ispionline.it/en/publication/moscows-arctic-projects-amidst-the-war-sanctions-lng-projects-icebreakers-and-the-northern-sea-route-178452) to zero
by December 2022, with exports to Asia reaching 300,000 barrels per day.

Moreover, after the war began, China exported technologies for Russian
Arctic LNG projects. However, sanctions on Russian LNG projects under
construction have made Chinese
companies [cautious](https://www.ispionline.it/en/publication/moscows-arctic-projects-amidst-the-war-sanctions-lng-projects-icebreakers-and-the-northern-sea-route-178452) about
continuing cooperation. Nevertheless, Russia's LNG supplies to China
in 2024 [increased
by 3.3%,](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/22919805) reaching 8.3 million tons,
although the cost of imports [decreased
by 3.5%](https://tass.ru/ekonomika/22919805) to \$ 4.99 billion. Beijing
plans [to increase LNG](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7658100) purchases
from Russia in 2025.

The NSR

Russia-China cooperation on the Northern Sea Route has experienced ups
and downs in recent years. In 2003, [[Russia
rejected](http://www.stimson.org/wp-content/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20-%20The%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20-%20The%20Myth%20of%20Sino-Russian%20Cooperation.pdf) Chinese
research vessels seeking to enter Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
during China's second Arctic expedition.]{.underline} In 2012, [Russia
prohibited](http://www.stimson.org/wp-content/files/file-attachments/Stimson%20-%20The%20Northern%20Sea%20Route%20-%20The%20Myth%20of%20Sino-Russian%20Cooperation.pdf) the
Chinese research icebreaker Xue Long from conducting maritime research
along the NSR during China's fifth Arctic expedition, forcing China
to suspend all research activities. However[,
in 2023](https://tass.ru/obschestvo/18757295), Chinese scientists aboard
the polar icebreaker Xue Long 2, as part of the 13th Arctic expedition,
completed research in collaboration with Russian specialists.

While Beijing seeks to harmonize approaches to Arctic maritime
management, Moscow is concerned that China is pushing for the «[maximum
internationalization](https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/rossiya-i-kitay-v-arktike-sostoyanie-i-perspektivy-dvustoronnego-sotrudnichestva)»
of the Arctic, which conflicts with Russia's interests. After the war
began, the two countries established a joint council to manage the NSR.
In April 2023,
they [signed](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/17611561) a Memorandum
of Understanding on Strengthening Law Enforcement Cooperation at Sea
between the Russian FSB and the Chinese Maritime Police Department.
In May 2024, Presidents Putin and Xi Jinping agreed to create
a sub-commission on the Development of the Northern Sea Route to promote
mutually beneficial cooperation in Arctic development and use. [Key
areas](https://portnews.ru/news/370780/) of joint projects include
navigation safety, planning, increasing cargo traffic along the NSR,
developing logistics routes, and exchanging information on ice,
meteorological, and other conditions.

In 2023, transit along the NSR between Russia and China [amounted to 2
million
tons](https://strana-rosatom.ru/2024/05/21/rossiya-i-kitaj-sozdadut-podkomissiju-p/),
with plans to increase this to 50 million tons by 2030. Moscow [also
aims](https://strana-rosatom.ru/2024/05/21/rossiya-i-kitaj-sozdadut-podkomissiju-p/) to engage
Chinese companies in infrastructure projects along the NSR. In 2024,
21.86 million tons of liquefied natural gas (LNG) were transported along
the NSR, accounting for 57.69% of the total cargo volume, with crude oil
comprising 21.37%. However, imported cargo via the NSR represented only
0.5% of its load. The volume of imported
cargo [increased](https://www.rbc.ru/economics/20/02/2025/67b600549a79479b3c106fca) from
94,000 tons in 2023 to 191,000 tons
in 2024, [shipped](https://www.rbc.ru/economics/20/02/2025/67b600549a79479b3c106fca) from
Chinese ports to Russian destinations such as Sabetta, Pevek, Murmansk,
Arkhangelsk, St. Petersburg, and Ust-Luga. In 2024, Chinese shipping
companies nearly [doubled](https://portnews.ru/news/370780/) their
voyages along the NSR.

In 2024, Rosatom and Hainan Yangpu NewNew Shipping Co.
Ltd. [signed](https://atommedia.online/2024/06/06/rosatom-podpisal-soglashenie-s-kitajs/) an agreement
to create a joint venture for designing and constructing high ice-class
container ships and operating a year-round container line along the NSR
between Russian and Chinese ports. NewNew Shipping Line and Rosatom
also [announced
plans](https://neftegaz.ru/news/Suda-i-sudostroenie/884241-newnew-shipping-line-uvelichit-aktivnost-po-smp-v-2025-g/) to begin
year-round transportation along the NSR by 2027. In contrast, in 2021,
the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade opposed joint production
of icebreakers and the transfer of design documentation
to China, [citing](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/4965338) competition
in Arctic developments. Chinese
operations [drove](https://gcaptain.com/chinese-newnew-shipping-line-to-expand-arctic-container-service-after-profitable-2024-operation/) a tenfold
increase in containerized cargo volume at the port in 2024.

Beyond resources and the NSR, China
is [interested](https://doi.org/10.26425/1816-4277-2018-4-43-50) in strategic
infrastructure projects such as the Arkhangelsk deep-water port and the
Belkomur railway. However, these projects have not been realized,
at least officially, due to Moscow's reluctance to allow foreign
companies, including Chinese ones, to participate in or own strategic
Arctic infrastructure.

Military Cooperation

To date, cooperation on Arctic Ocean maritime security between the
Russian and Chinese navies has not reached an advanced level. Although
they conduct joint drills in and around Arctic waters, their primary
focus remains the Pacific Ocean, where they have held joint naval
exercises, air patrols, and sea patrols. However, the melting Arctic ice
is increasing the interdependence between the Pacific and Arctic
strategic spaces. Since 2022, joint drills have
also [occurred](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202407/1316829.shtml) in Arctic
waters, with increased air and sea activities in and around the Bering
Sea. The Bering Strait, a strategic connection between the two oceans,
plays a vital role in the NSR's link to the Pacific.

In 2024, Russia and
China [conducted](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/66fd27549a794741e59e332f) several
joint exercises in or near the Arctic Ocean. They carried out drills
in the Pacific and Arctic Oceans as part of the Okean-2024 exercises.
Additionally, the Beibu/Interaction-2024 naval exercises [took
place](https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/66fd27549a794741e59e332f) in the
Okhotsk and Japan Seas. These developments [have
raised](https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF) significant
concerns in Washington.

International Governance vs. Sovereign Rights of Coastal Countries?

As a non-Arctic power, China primarily supports the internationalization
of Arctic governance. However, it is not alone in this stance; its
competitor, India, [also
views](https://arcticyearbook.com/images/yearbook/2013/Scholarly_Papers/1.LACKENBAUER.pdf) the
Arctic as a «common heritage of mankind» and [seeks
strategic](https://arcticyearbook.com/images/yearbook/2013/Scholarly_Papers/1.LACKENBAUER.pdf) positioning
for future resource exploitation and shipping accessibility. The United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) [recognizes](https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf) the
«common heritage of mankind» as applying to the seabed, ocean floor, and
subsoil beyond national jurisdiction, while also affirming the sovereign
rights of coastal states over their exclusive economic zones
(EEZs). [Assessments
indicate](https://library.arcticportal.org/1890/1/DENMARK.pdf) that most
Arctic oil and gas deposits [lie
within](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/divers/join/2010/433791/EXPO-AFET_DV(2010)433791_EN.pdf) the
EEZs of coastal states.

China acknowledges the sovereign rights of coastal countries
to resources on their continental shelves and [seeks
to increase](https://www.imemo.ru/publications/periodical/meimo/archive/2016/2-t-60/arctic-new-region-of-world-policy/russia-and-china-in-the-arctic-real-or-alleged-disagreements) cooperation
with these states to access resources in their EEZs. Officially, Beijing
emphasizes compliance with international rules and [does not
challenge](https://www.imemo.ru/en/publications/periodical/meimo/archive/2016/2-t-60/arctic-new-region-of-world-policy/russia-and-china-in-the-arctic-real-or-alleged-disagreements) the
sovereign rights of coastal states. As such[, Moscow's concerns about
growing Chinese involvement in its EEZ appear manageable. While China
lacks the capacity to fundamentally alter Arctic legal regimes, it [can
influence specific
rules](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/polar-record/article/can-china-change-the-arctic-regime/6FB5A7F74089A46C2EB36CD973562595),
such as those related to Arctic Ocean management and scientific
cooperation.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Given the security-focused mindset of Russia's foreign policy elite,
it is likely that [Russia will maintain cautious approaches toward the
increasing roles of non-Arctic powers in the Arctic under any
international relations scenario]{.underline}. Moreover, China is keen
to avoid deteriorating relations with other Arctic countries,
particularly amid discussions in Washington about the possibility
of thawing U.S.-Russia relations.

Cooperation with China on LNG projects appears to have long-term
potential, even if relations between Russia and the U.S. or the EU
normalize. With the United States increasing shale gas production and
aiming to expand exports to the EU, [Russia's cooperation with China
in Arctic LNG production and marketing offers opportunities to diversify
LNG supplies for the long term]{.underline}, potentially strengthening
Russia's position in the global energy market. Russia is unlikely
to relinquish such a significant energy market as China, especially
given the anticipated competition with other major LNG producers,
including the United States.

To reduce or halt joint military activities with China in the Arctic,
particularly near U.S. waters, could be a key issue Moscow might
leverage in negotiations with Washington. However, increasing joint
military activities with China in the Arctic has never been a priority
for Moscow; rather, it is a means to deter, challenge, or unsettle
a common adversary, the United States. At the same time, Moscow is wary
of allowing China to establish a military presence in the High North.

Although confrontation with the U.S. has been a primary driver
of Russia-China cooperation in the Arctic, shared geoeconomic interests
also foster convergence. Moscow would welcome cooperation with the West
if it successfully normalizes relations with Washington, but it is also
keen to balance its relations among major powers in the international
system. The sanctions imposed since 2014, following the invasion
of Ukraine, have taught Moscow not to rely solely on one partner.
In an optimistic scenario for the United States, Russia-China relations
may revert to their pre-2022 invasion levels, but they are unlikely
to return to pre-2014 levels. Such a scenario would depend on Moscow
achieving its objectives in negotiations with Washington over Ukraine
and possibly other international issues of concern to the Kremlin.
However, whether this would serve U.S. long-term interests is a separate
question that requires further consideration.

### 2AC---Won't Align

A FOREIGN POLICY MISMATCH

[[Russia and China are **hardly**]{.mark} **any [close]{.mark}r** [in
foreign policy]{.mark} than they are in trade]{.underline}. To be sure,
the two countries stand together in their declared opposition to U.S.
primacy in world affairs. Both advocate a multipolar world and swear to
resist the perceived threat of U.S. intrusion into their spheres of
influence. Beijing and Moscow also see eye to eye with respect to the
threat posed to their regimes by what they see as U.S.-inspired, if not
U.S.-engineered, pro-democracy "color revolutions." They vote almost in
unison at the United Nations.

Yet [away from the global limelight]{.underline} and closer to their
shared Eurasian home, [the two]{.underline} countries [are **hardly
aligned**. [They poach]{.mark} in [each other's **s**]{.mark}pheres
**[o]{.mark}**f **[i]{.mark}**nfluence, [contest]{.mark} each other's
[clients, and reach for each other's]{.mark} **economic and geopolitical
[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[China]{.mark} has [failed to support]{.mark} Russia [in matters of
**great**]{.mark} **geopolitical [importance]{.mark}** to Moscow.
Beijing refused to recognize]{.underline} the independence of [Abkhazia
and South Ossetia after the Russian-**[Georgia]{.mark}**n
war]{.underline} in 2008. [It abstained from]{.underline}, instead of
voting against, [the UN resolution condemning Russia's]{.underline} 2014
[seizure of **[Crimea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In another symbolic
display that could not have pleased Moscow, President Xi Jinping chose
to inaugurate the 2013 Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Astana, the
capital of Kazakhstan. By choosing to flex Chinese power in the largest
of the former Soviet Central Asian republics---the one that shares the
world's second-longest border with Russia, at 4,250 miles, and is home
to the greatest proportion of ethnic Russians in Central Asia---Xi
flagrantly intruded on Russia's sphere of influence. (A year later,
Putin mused about the fragility of Kazakhstan's statehood during a
question and answer session at Russia's National Youth Forum.) Xi and
Putin later agreed to "coordinat\[e\] cooperation" between the
Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and Belt and Road. But although some
of the subsequent Chinese- and Kazakh-led infrastructure projects have
been completed, many Russian-led projects have stalled due to financing
and negotiation problems.

For its part, Russia periodically flirts with China's foe, Japan, by
dangling the return of the four Kuril Islands, which the Soviet Union
seized from Japan at the end of World War II and which remain the main
obstacle to a peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo. In the latest round
of that game, during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit this past January
to Moscow, Putin, yet again, held out the possibility of normalizing
relations by giving Japan back at least two of the islands, a gesture
that Beijing likely resented, even though it did not lead to a
breakthrough. Russia also exposed tensions with China within the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization---an international body founded by
Moscow and Beijing to promote economic and security cooperation among
its members---when it invited another Chinese rival, India, to join the
group. China tied the score by inviting India's archrival (and the
largest customer for Chinese weapons), Pakistan, to join.

Chinese-Russian military cooperation in particular is often held up as
evidence of a growing closeness. Much has been made of the fact that
Russia has sold China the latest version of its most advanced
antiaircraft S-400 missile defense system. But India, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey are next in line for the same equipment. And although
China was the first to buy Russia's most advanced Su-35 jet fighter, it
will not be the last. Indonesia has contracted for 11 jets, Egypt has
purchased dozens more, and India has reportedly considered buying 114
jets. Overall, from 2013 to 2017, India was a far likelier destination
for Russian defense hardware than China, with 35 percent of Russian arms
exports going to New Delhi, compared with 12 percent to Beijing.

Last year's first joint Russian-Chinese land exercise, Vostok-2018,
pointed to an imbalance in military cooperation not unlike the one in
the two countries' bilateral trade. Russia fielded between 75,000 and
100,000 soldiers and 1,000 aircraft; China contributed just 3,200
soldiers and six planes. Mathieu Boulègue of Chatham House argued that
China was invited to participate not so much to bolster an alliance as
to allay any Chinese concerns about the demonstration of force so close
to its borders.

Indeed, the need for strengthening mutual trust between the putative
allies was evident three years before Vostok-2018, during the Kremlin's
search for Internet policing technology. Following a series of
high-level internal consultations, the Kremlin decided to buy data
storage and servers from the telecom giant Huawei. Then, suddenly, the
deal was off. The security services became so alarmed by the likelihood
of Chinese espionage that they dared to challenge the Kremlin's
decision---and, even more surprisingly, managed to reverse it.

THE PUTIN-XI BROMANCE

In the end, the most promising portent of an alliance might be the
personal relationship between the rulers of the two countries. The
Putin-Xi bonhomie extends beyond surface pleasantries. They have met
more than 25 times, far more frequently than either has with any other
head of state. Xi recently called Putin his "best friend," and his first
visit as president was to Moscow. Putin has extolled his relations with
Xi as the finest personal rapport he has with a foreign leader and
fondly recalled celebrating his sixty-first birthday with Xi, over
slices of sausage and shots of vodka, during the Asian-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Bali in 2013. Xi presented Putin with China's very
first Order of Friendship, designed to reward foreigners who contributed
"personally to the PRC's cooperation with the world community." Putin
hung a gold chain of the Order of St. Andrew, Russia's highest civilian
award, on Xi's neck.

Sustained mutual affinities between the leaders of great powers almost
always reflect not only overlap in geopolitical objectives but regime
similarities. Both Putin and Xi preside over versions of state
capitalism. Putin's attraction to Xi is not hard to fathom: the Chinese
leader is a fellow authoritarian who controls an enormous economy, which
even in today's downturn posts rates of growth of which Russia can only
dream of. And China does this even while importing huge quantities of
oil and gas.

Xi's alleged respect for Putin likely stems from the Russian president's
deft defusing of several potentially explosive domestic political
problems similar to ones Xi himself has faced. After taking office,
Putin recentralized power within the Russian state, taming the oligarchs
and wiping out the political strongholds of elected governors and
presidents. Then, early in Putin's third term in 2012, as he faced bleak
economic prospects and rapidly declining approval ratings, he rejected
the liberalizing reforms that his minister of finance suggested.
Instead, Putin began to shift the foundation of his regime's legitimacy
from economic progress and income growth to the Kremlin as a defender of
Russia against U.S. aggression and restorer of its past glory as a
global superpower---a formula that the leading Russian political
sociologist Igor Klyamkin has labeled "militarized patriotism."

Concomitantly, Putin cracked down on public displays of dissent, called
for the "patriotic upbringing of the youth," and further intimidated
civil society by signing a law designating many NGOs as "foreign
agents," rendering them social pariahs subject to harassment by the
security and tax authorities. He made the Orthodox Church the guardian
of national mores, and he personally guided the politicization of
history textbooks, which began to whitewash the Soviet experience and
rehabilitate Stalin.

On the road to his own chairmanship---and presidency for life---Xi has
reprised Putin's choices, in spirit if not always letter. He
concentrated policymaking in the office of the party chairman, broke the
baronies of regional party secretaries, and instigated a widespread
"anti-corruption" campaign aimed at eliminating, or intimidating,
potential critics and rivals. He abolished the de facto term limits for
top party and government positions and tightened controls over media and
book publishing.

As Chinese growth rates began to decline, Xi, like his "best friend,"
spurned pro-market reforms and instead opted for his own version of
Putin's militarized patriotism: the reassertion of the Communist Party's
supremacy, the merger of "core socialist values" with "traditions of
Chinese culture," and a war on "spiritual pollution" that has led to
heightened repression in Tibet and Xinjiang.

Similarly, "national rejuvenation" and the pursuit of the "Chinese
dream" became central to the regime's foreign policy discourse. In Xi's
words, China was facing "the most complicated ... external factors in
\[its\] history." Admiral Sun Jianguo, a deputy chief of the General
Staff of the People's Liberation Army, described these factors as
"invasion, subversion," "undermining ... stability," and "interrupting
socialist development." Much as Putin had done, Xi transformed his
country's foreign policy from assertive to aggressively expansionist.
The Chinese leader has militarized territorial disputes in the South and
East China Seas and fortified Chinese-constructed artificial island
chains with missile batteries and aircraft bases.

STILL PREMATURE

[Putin's and Xi's kinship]{.underline} is real and formidable, but [even
it may not be enough to overcome the **obstacles** to a genuine
alliance. One such obstacle is]{.underline} aptly described by a Russian
expression, "istoriya s geografiey." Literally ["a **history with
geography**,"]{.underline} the collocation refers to a seemingly
straightforward matter suddenly turned into something involved and
complicated. [[**History** and]{.mark} **geography** militate against an
entente cordiale between the two Eurasian giants. Authoritarian states
[sharing **a 2,600-mile border**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with much of that
boundary first imposed by imperial Russia on a weaker neighbor, [[are
**hardly ideal**]{.mark}ly set up [to build]{.mark} mutual
[trust]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Reinforcing that barrier are **very significant [structural
differences]{.mark}** []{.mark}between the two countries' **economies**,
which [result in]{.mark} their holding **[divergent stakes]{.mark}** in
the present world economic order. Confined largely to]{.underline}

the world economy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} at once quite [secure and
quite [limited]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moscow can afford to rock the boat
and to seek from Beijing a pointedly anti-Western, active, and committed
military-political partnership.

[China's economy]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is the world's second
largest]{.underline}---more than seven times the size of Russia's---with
exports that include advanced communication technologies, cell phones,
computers, and cars. The country's [trade with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [comes to]{.underline}
at least five [times the value of its Russian account. Because
of]{.underline} its [greater interdependence]{.underline} with other
leading world economies, [[China's]{.mark} system is]{.underline} also
[**far [more vulnerable]{.mark}** to]{.underline} geopolitical
[disruptions]{.underline} than Russia's. And as a greater beneficiary of
the liberal international economic order than Russia, [China is warier
of antagonizing]{.underline} that order's ultimate guarantor, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Skillfully promoted
optics notwithstanding, [**[China is not likely to follow]{.mark} Russia
into [an anti-Western]{.mark} geopolitical [crusade]{.mark}**,
preferring to cooperate with its alleged ally on a **more modest**
scale]{.underline} economically and especially militarily.

When I was living in Moscow in the fall of 1969, a rumor circulated
that, returning from Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's funeral, Chairman
of the Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin stopped over in the Beijing
airport for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai. When the
Chinese premier moved to embrace him, Kosygin drew back, saying, "Тhis
is premature."

Apocryphal or not, Kosygin's injunction seems applicable today.
[**Despite claims to the contrary**, the notion of a Chinese-Russian
alliance is **still premature**]{.underline}.

3.2.2.1 Closer Ties Amid Political Mistrust [With the]{.underline}
subsequent [deterioration of Russia's]{.underline} political [relations
with the West]{.underline} in 2014, the U.S. foreign policy posture
aimed at containing both Chinese and Russian power projections as well
as the situation of NASA (prohibited from cooperating with both China as
a result of the Wolf amendment and Russia, following the 2014 sanctions
over the latter's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula), [cooperation
between the two countries has in a sense become a forced
choice]{.underline} (Aliberti, 2015). Remarkably, few weeks after the
suspension of cooperation by NASA and the announcement that Russia was
not interested in expanding the operations of the ISS beyond 2020,
[[Russia started to trumpet]{.mark} a future of closer [ties
with]{.mark} the [Chinese]{.mark} partner]{.underline}. To illustrate,
during a roundtable discussion held at the First Russia-China Expo in
Harbin on 30 June 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin
stressed: "If we talk about manned space flights and exploration of
outer space, as well as joint exploration of the Solar
System---primarily it is the Moon and Mars---we are ready to go forth
with our Chinese friends, hand in hand" (LaRouche Pac, 2014).
[Notwithstanding this]{.underline} clear [**statement of interest** and
**diplomatic niceties**]{.underline} contained in the speech of Dmitry
Rogozin, [the [prospects of]{.mark} closer Russia-China [relations
were]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least initially---[used as [a
**bargaining chip** to show the West]{.mark} possible [fallouts
of]{.mark} their [isolation]{.mark} policies, [rather than]{.mark} a
**[genuine]{.mark} desire** to engage with the Chinese
partner]{.underline}. Indeed, [traditionally [Russia has been]{.mark}
visibly **[reluctant]{.mark}** to talk openly about]{.underline} its
[cooperation with China]{.underline} and has always visualised the
bilateral relations under its leadership. It is for instance remarkable
that while the Chinese received training at Star City to become
taikonauts, [no Chinese ever flew with the Russians as
"passenger"]{.underline}, and vice versa (Mathieu, 2008). **[[Imperial
mind-sets are]{.mark} after all [hard to let go]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[More broadly, when looking at the Russian approach to cooperation with
its neighbour, [a key caveat is]{.mark} their **[mutual]{.mark}
historical [mistrust]{.mark}**. Indeed, the Chinese- Russian
relationship has been in fact "**bedevilled** by **pervasive mistrust**,
[rooted in **historical grievances**]{.mark}, **geopolitical
[competition]{.mark}** [and **structural factors**]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(Kotkin, 2009). Chinese officials are well aware of the so-called
"China-threat theory" that is deeply rooted among both the general
public and Russia's elites and harks all the way back to the Tsarist
Empire. In addition, [Russia appears extremely wary of Beijing's
rising]{.underline} economic and political [influence]{.underline}
within the international system (Medeiros, 2009). [China, in return, has
long seen Russia as its voracious neighbour]{.underline}, witness
Russia's part in China's century of shame and Mao's statements on
Chinese readiness to let hundreds of millions die if necessary to defend
the country against Soviet aggression. Admittedly, at present
Sino-Russian relations look to be the most stable bilateral relationship
maintained by Russia.15 The two countries are engaged in an all
dimensional, multi-tiered and wide-ranging cooperation that also extends
to military to- military cooperation and is substantiated in the
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).16 While trade relations do not
play an important role in the current Sino-Russian
interplay---especially when compared to China's profound economic
interdependence with the U.S. and Europe---Russia remains an
indispensable source of energy supply (in particular oil and natural
gas) for Beijing (Aliberti, 2015). This does not however mean that
Russia has more bargaining chips than China. Quite to the contrary, the
partnership is inherently "asymmetric", and in China's favour. Stephen
Kotkin, professor of history at Princeton University, has underlined
that "China extracts considerable practical benefits in oil and weapons
from Russia. In return, Beijing has been flattering Moscow with rhetoric
about their 'strategic partnership' and coddling it by promoting the
illusion of amultipolar world. In many ways, [the [Chinese-Russian
relations]{.mark}hip]{.underline} today [[resembles]{.underline}]{.mark}
that which first emerged in the seventeenth century: [a rivalry for
influence in Central Asia alongside attempts to expand bilateral
commercial ties]{.underline}, with China in the catbird seat" (Kotkin,
2009). Also Bobo [Lo]{.underline}, a former Australian diplomat in
Moscow, has remarkably [labelled their]{.underline} strategic
[partnership [an **"axis of convenience"**]{.mark}]{.underline}
primarily pushed by the need to constrain U.S. diplomatic and military
power, [[rather than]{.mark} by any **[real will]{.mark}** to establish
a mutually complementary and cooperative relationship]{.underline} (Lo,
2008).

## China Soft Power Disadvantage

### 2AC---Link Turn

#### India-Russia ties prevent Chinese influence in the arctic.

Within this context, the [authorities in [Moscow see]{.mark} potential
benefits in **[India's]{.mark}** increased **Arctic
[engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}.37) India's [presence could
[allow]{.mark} [**Russia** to **diversify**]{.mark} its pool of
**[investors]{.mark}** and [reduce its **reliance** on **China**]{.mark}
under the pretext of **Arctic cooperation** towards deepening strategic
and **defence ties**]{.underline} [with New Delhi]{.underline}.38)
Unlike China, it is reasonable to suggest that [[India]{.mark} is likely
[**perceived** as]{.mark} a partne[r with fewer **regional
ambitions**]{.mark}]{.underline} and hence less capable of, and indeed
willing to, challenge the Arctic's geopolitical balance, at least in the
medium term. So, while India is not capable of matching China's
financial contributions, its comparatively limited resources make it
less likely to contest Russia's dominance in the Arctic. [India's [more
**favourable global image**]{.mark} also [makes it]{.mark} a **[less
contentious]{.mark}** partner than China]{.underline}, [thereby
attracting less **international scrutiny**]{.underline}. Additionally,
India-Russia bilateral relations have been long-standing, and both
countries have similar perspectives on state sovereignty and perceive
Western adherence to international law to be inconsistent.39)

[India's [increasing role]{.mark} in the Arctic [helps Russia]{.mark}
not only **[counterbalance China's influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} but
also mediate improving ties between the governments in New Delhi and
Washington, D.C., potentially even allowing it to establish itself as an
intermediary between China and India in the long term.

## Politics Disadvantage

### 2AC---Plan is Bipartisan 

#### Collaboration with India is bipartisan.

**Miller '25** \[Manjari; June 5; Senior fellow for India, Pakistan and

United States-India Strategic Partnership and Defense Norms,"
https://www.cfr.org/article/divergence-despite-convergence-united-states-india-strategic-partnership-and-defense-norms\]

The U.S.-India defense partnership has come a long way. Beginning in
2001, the United States and India moved from little defense cooperation
or coordination to significant gestures that would lay the foundation of
the robust defense partnership that exists today---such as India
offering access to its facilities after 9/11 to help the United States
launch operations in Afghanistan or the 123 Agreement in 2005 that paved
the way for civil nuclear cooperation between the two countries. [In the
**U**nited]{.underline} [**S**tates]{.underline}, [there is **bipartisan
agreeme**nt that a **strong** defense **partnership** with **India** is
**vital** for its **Indo-Pacific strategy** and containing
**China**]{.underline}. In [India, too, there is **broad political
support** for its **strategic partnership** with the United States given
its **immense wariness** about its fractious border relationship with
China]{.underline}. Consequently, the U.S.-India bilateral relationship
has heavily emphasized security, with even trade tilting toward defense
goods.

## BRICS Disadvantage 

### 2AC---BRICS Failing Now 

#### BRICS structurally fails.

**Menon' 24** \[Saahil; October 11; an investment analyst with a
background in business economics and finance; New Eastern Europe, "How
BRICS is collapsing under the weight of its own ambition,"
https://neweasterneurope.eu/2024/10/11/how-brics-is-collapsing-under-the-weight-of-its-own-ambition/\]

Among the reasons why [**BRICS** has, nonetheless, **failed** to
position itself as a **credible counterweight** to the **G7** or
**OECD** is acute internal rivalries]{.underline}. This is [especially
true regarding China and India]{.underline}. Ever since the Galwan
Valley border clash four years ago that left 20 Indian soldiers dead,
[**diplomatic ties** between the two Asian giants have remained at
**rock bottom**]{.underline}. India has [steered clear of the Belt and
Road Initiative (**BRI**)]{.underline}, refused to resume direct flights
to China, and played an increasingly active role alongside the US, Japan
and Australia in the Quad -- a strategic security coalition aimed at
containing Beijing's influence across the Indo-Pacific region.

Another less talked about [territorial dispute BRICS has managed to
**import concerns Iran** and the **UAE**]{.underline}. [Despite
**repeatedly lobbying** Russia and China to condemn the Islamic
Republic's alleged **annexation** of the three **Persian Gulf
islands**]{.underline} of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb, the
[**Emiratis** are effectively underwriting their own
position]{.underline} given Dubai's [notorious reputation as the go-to
**offshore haven** for IRGC-linked officials to launder and stash away
their ill-gotten gains]{.underline}. To make matters worse, the [Kremlin
has invited arch foes **Armenia** and **Azerbaijan**]{.underline} to the
upcoming BRICS forum in Kazan that will take place next month.

When it comes to potential enlargement, however, [**Russia** -- which
currently chairs **BRICS** -- appears to have engaged in
doublespeak]{.underline}. On the one hand, Putin continues to boast
about the fact that 34 countries are vying for accession and hint at the
absence of any hard and fast criterion that must be fulfilled to make
the cut. At the same time, Lavrov recently [ruled out the intake of any
additional members in order to first "**process new
arrivals**]{.underline}". Although the "de-dollarization" agenda is
bound to feature prominently in Kazan, prospects for launching an
alternative payment mechanism and common currency are still riddled with
challenges.

For starters, [most BRICS participants are not as gung-ho about
disrupting the **status quo** as the **Russians**, **Chinese** and
**Iranians**]{.underline}. [Efforts to bypass **SWIFT** and entertain
**non-dollar cross-border transactions** at scale could expose nations
on cordial terms with the **West**]{.underline} -- such as India, Brazil
and South Africa -- to secondary sanctions. There have already been
cases of [punitive measures **imposed** on **third-country banks** that
facilitate **financial flows** to and from Russia]{.underline}.
Moreover, [most funding and lending administered by the New Development
Bank (**NDB**) is done in **US dollars**]{.underline}, with borrowing in
local currencies amounting to less than 20 per cent.

4\. Challenges in Arctic Scientific Cooperation within the BRICS
Framework

Although the breadth and depth of Arctic scientific cooperation within
the [BRICS]{.underline} framework are gradually expanding, [the
**internal structural**, **cooperative willingness**, and **research
capacity imbalances** among BRICS countries, coupled with the complex
interplay of external \"**bloc confrontation**\" tendencies in the
Arctic and the significant political event of the **Russia-Ukraine**
conflict, collectively constitute multidimensional cooperation
**challenges**]{.underline}. These factors [interact and reinforce each
other]{.underline}, [resulting in **relatively weak** and
**insufficiently supported** efforts in Arctic scientific cooperation
within the BRICS framework]{.underline}.

4.1. Structural Defects

Although BRICS countries have established mechanisms such as the \"Ocean
and Polar Science\" thematic working group and the Science, Technology,
and Innovation Ministerial Meetings, specific implementation rules and
operational procedures for Arctic scientific cooperation still require
improvement. There is a [certain **structural imbalance** in BRICS
cooperation in the field of **science**, **technology** and
**innovation**]{.underline} (Kiselev, & Nechaeva, 2018).The processes
for initiating and executing joint Arctic research projects need further
refinement. According to the \"BRICS Memorandum of Understanding on
Cooperation in Science, Technology, and Innovation,\" BRICS countries
can formulate and implement cooperative research plans. Currently,
although the [BRICS Science, Technology, and Innovation Framework
Program]{.underline} (BRICS STI Framework Programme) has largely
established standards for project initiation, fund allocation, execution
supervision, and outcome evaluation, it [has not yet addressed **Arctic
research**]{.underline} (National Natural Science Foundation of China,
2023) . Although the \"Ocean and Polar Science\" thematic working group
focuses on polar science and has proposed priority research topics in
ocean and polar science and technology for BRICS members under the BRICS
STI Framework Programme (BRICS, 2021), [**very few** Arctic research
projects have been **approved**]{.underline}. For example, none of the
33 projects approved in the fifth batch of the BRICS STI Framework
Programme were related to Arctic research (BRICS STI FRAMEWORK
PROGRAMME, 2021), which is inconsistent with the thematic group\'s name,
\"Ocean and Polar Science.\" In the future, BRICS countries should pay
more attention to the application and approval of joint Arctic research
projects, ensuring the quality and effectiveness of Arctic research
initiatives.

4.2. Cognitive Differences

BRICS members [have varying **strategic goals** and **priorities** in
the Arctic]{.underline}, which limits the breadth and depth of
cooperation. As an Arctic state, [Russia\'s Arctic strategy]{.underline}
integrates multiple [objectives, including]{.underline} resource
development, shipping route utilization, and [national security, with a
tendency to maintain its **dominant position** in]{.underline} the
Arctic, characterized by regional and exclusive features. In contrast,
[China adopts a more global perspective, focusing on Arctic climate
change, scientific **exploration**, and potential **economic
benefits**]{.underline}, with a broader and longer-term strategic
orientation (Mammadli, & Kalfaoglu, 2021). At the same time, the
[long-standing historical **border dispute** between **India** and
**China**]{.underline}, as well as [Russia\'s **misgivings** about
China\'s intentions for its activities in the Arctic]{.underline},
constitute notable obstacles on the road to Arctic scientific
cooperation (Sagild, & Elgsaas, 2024). India has long pursued a
\"pragmatic policy,\" and the spillover effects of the Russia-Ukraine
conflict have left it wavering in the Arctic situation. Under the
leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has increasingly
strengthened its Arctic presence, deepening partnerships with Arctic
countries and continuously focusing on shipping route development and
scientific research, particularly the impact of Arctic climate change on
its domestic agriculture. Currently, India conducts research activities
on Svalbard through the Ny-Ålesund research station operated by the
Norwegian company Kings Bay AS. However, India is also acutely aware of
the geopolitical complexities in the Arctic, especially the
uncertainties brought by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and has therefore
adopted a relatively cautious approach in its Arctic strategic
deployment, avoiding excessive involvement in regional disputes. Brazil
has also shown increasing interest in the Arctic, signaling emerging
powers\' renewed recognition of the Arctic\'s strategic value. In
contrast, [**South Africa** and new BRICS members have **limited
interest** in the Arctic and have **not fully integrated** into the
Arctic interest landscape]{.underline}. These differences in strategic
cognition and positioning [lead to **divergent priorities**, path
choices, and cooperation models among BRICS countries in Arctic
cooperation, limiting the **breadth** and **depth** of **collaboration**
and making it difficult to form **effective synergies**]{.underline}

4.3. Capacity Limitations

There is a [**significant imbalance** in the research capabilities of
BRICS members]{.underline}. [Russia\'s **natural geographical
advantages** have allowed it to **accumulate extensive
experience**]{.underline} and data in Arctic research, [giving it a
clear lead in **scientific capabilities**]{.underline}. Geographically,
as a key Arctic state, Russia possesses vast Arctic territories and
direct research conveniences, enabling more direct observation of Arctic
environmental changes and on-site research. The Arctic has always been a
priority area for Russia\'s science and technology development strategy.
Since 2010, Russia has invested 2 billion rubles (approximately \$70
million) annually in Arctic research and expeditions, making it the
world\'s largest investor in Arctic research. Although [China, India,
and Brazil are Arctic **stakeholders**, they face **challenges** in
accessing **research resources**]{.underline}. China and India only
became Arctic Council observers in 2013, while [Brazil and South Africa
have not yet joined the **Arctic Council** and are located in the
**Southern Hemisphere**]{.underline}. Although these countries have made
significant progress in Arctic research in recent years, they are still
in the early stages, with deficiencies in research equipment,
professional capabilities of researchers, and data accumulation. [South
Africa possesses certain polar research capabilities but has long
focused on **Antarctic research**]{.underline}. In 2021, South Africa
established the South African Polar Research Infrastructure (SAPRI),
making ocean and Antarctic research a major national initiative, but it
has yet to make strides in the Arctic. The [**disparities** in Arctic
research capabilities among BRICS countries create a **capacity gap** in
cooperation]{.underline}. As seen from the current cooperation status,
Arctic scientific cooperation within the BRICS framework primarily takes
the form of \"bilateral\" and \"Russia+\" collaborations, with Russia
remaining at the core of Arctic scientific cooperation.

4.4. Arctic "Bloc Confrontation"

Since the full escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the \"Arctic
Seven\" (A7) countries have adopted a firm exclusionary stance toward
Russia based on geopolitical considerations, directly promoting the
formation of a \"bloc confrontation\" dynamic in the Arctic region.
[Western countries have suspended **scientific cooperation** with Russia
on multiple platforms, impacting Russia\'s research
resources]{.underline}. Given [Russia\'s central role in Arctic
**scientific cooperation**, this limits the **autonomy** of BRICS
countries in Arctic scientific collaboration]{.underline}, making it
difficult for them to play a more significant role in Arctic science.
Currently, Western Arctic researchers are cut off from over 60% of
research areas and cannot exchange data with former Russian partners,
while Russia also faces challenges in accessing funding and
technological support (ZOiS, 2024). Additionally, the sanctions imposed
by the U.S. government on October 30, 2024, targeting nearly 400
entities and individuals, including BRICS members and partner countries
such as India, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates,
have significantly increased the resistance faced by BRICS countries
(The United States Government, 2024). These [**\"deterrence\"**
strategies implemented by the U.S. and its Western allies may **force**
BRICS countries to adopt a **more cautious approach** in handling
matters related to Russia]{.underline}.

### 2AC---BRICS Collapse Inevitable 

#### BRICS collapse inevitable---Arctic won't save the alliance

Policy, "The BRICS Is Not a Strategic Threat to the United States",
*Geopolitical Monitor*,
<https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/the-brics-is-not-a-strategic-threat-to-the-united-states/>,
September 7, 2023

Two weeks ago, the [BRICS]{.underline} announced that [Argentina, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates will join the
"alliance]{.underline}" in 2024. [Despite]{.underline} widespread
[enthusiasm]{.underline} in anti-Western circles, the soon-to-be
11-member economic bloc is a partnership of convenience. [It is **not a
long-term alliance nor a strategic threat** to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. The criteria to join the BRICS are vague. [There
is no charter and no fixed secretariat.]{.underline} Not even a
functional website. This paper tiger also has a long list of structural
challenges to overcome. [Its ideological incoherence,]{.underline}
characterized [by issues ranging from internal conflicts of interest to
divergent international perspectives]{.underline}, [will pose complex
challenges to the "bloc"]{.underline} for the foreseeable future.

[Argentina and Egypt are locked in endless economic crises.]{.underline}
Both countries are fundamentally bankrupt due to the incompetent
management of the Argentine and Egyptian governments. They [remain
**heavily indebted** to their international creditors,]{.underline}
namely institutions set up by the United States. As the two biggest
debtors to the International Monetary Fund, their joint interest in
joining the BRICS is to balance their dependence on the West by shifting
their financial burdens onto the shoulders of other potential creditors.
While [Beijing is likely to take advantage of Argentina's and Egypt's
devalued currencies to purchase assets at bargain prices]{.underline}
and increase the number of transactions concluded in yuan rather than
dollars, Buenos Aires and Cairo benefit from increased foreign direct
investment and renewed access to foreign currency.

[Ethiopia was ravaged by the Tigray War.]{.underline} That
[devastation]{.underline} is [aggravated by drought and
famine]{.underline} in the north of the country. Although Ethiopia is
experiencing exponential economic growth, the above-mentioned crisis is
exacerbated by historic capital flight. Professor Alemayehu Geda
estimates that Ethiopia registered at least \$45 billion in capital
outflows over the last decade. He also emphasizes that this sum exceeds
the total amount over the previous 44-year period. [While Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates provided]{.underline} invaluable [security
assistance to the Ethiopian]{.underline} government during the civil
war, the largest volume of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia now
comes from China. [Consolidating all these relationships by joining the
BRICS is a low-hanging fruit rather than a diplomatic power
play.]{.underline}

[Iran is sanctioned by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
Like Moscow and Pyongyang, Tehran now finds itself caught in Beijing's
grasp. [Despite]{.underline} the "[diplomatic rapprochement" brokered by
China]{.underline}, [the greatest national security threat to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is still Iran.]{.underline} Tehran
supports several terrorist groups in the Middle East. It has enriched
uranium up to at least 60 percent, 20 times more than the allowable
amount under the now-defunct JCPOA. While Iran has previously launched
drone strikes against both of its neighbors, the IRGC continues to
hijack ships in the Strait of Hormuz and engage in hostage diplomacy. To
fan the flames, several unresolved territorial disputes remain in the
Persian Gulf region, including the Abu Musa Islands impasse between
Tehran and Abu Dhabi. By [joining]{.underline} t[he BRICS, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates balance their dependence on Washington for
security with their economic relations with Beijing and Delhi. It also
provides them with an additional forum for diplomacy with Tehran should
the need arise.]{.underline}

China, along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are three
of India's top five economic partners. Nevertheless, [Delhi and Beijing
remain at odds on a multitude of issue]{.underline}s. [Despite concerns
about America on China's side, and Pakistan on India's, Delhi and
Beijing are undoubtedly each other's greatest long-term geopolitical
threat.]{.underline} Before the end of the 21st century, China and India
will both be major powers that share a border longer than 3,400
kilometers. Without [diving into the details of their long-standing
border disputes, climate change, which exacerbates water scarcity and
food insecurity, will be an endless source of tension for these two
countries]{.underline}. [Their]{.underline} political [systems are also
incompatible. China and Russia do not benefit from the "democratic
peace.]{.underline}" This increases the likelihood of a large-scale
military conflict over time. For these reasons and others, [India
balances its dependence on Russian armaments and its economic relations
with China by being a member of the Quad, a security forum with
Australia, Japan, and the United States.]{.underline}

### 2AC---BRICS Bad---LIO 

#### BRICS collapses the LIO.

**Smith-Boyle '22** \[Vanessa; July 8; a senior at American University

Influence Abroad,"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has threatened the liberal world order and
disrupted stability in Europe, but these are not the only effects the
United States should be worried about. In addition to the obvious
challenges to concepts of sovereignty, the war in Ukraine has
precipitated the recent strengthening of the [BRICS]{.underline}
(Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) group, which could
[challenge the current Western-led world]{.underline} order if not
addressed effectively. [If the U.S. wants to secure the future against
the growing influence of authoritarian countries like China and Russia,
it must acknowledge and offer an attractive alternative to the growing
influence of BRICS]{.underline}.

The increased collaboration between the BRICS states should worry the
U.S. as the group is an already strong, economically powerful coalition
that is looking to expand. Currently, the five countries of BRICS make
up 40% of the world's population, 30% of land coverage, 18% of world
trade, and 25% of the global nominal GDP. Moreover, these countries play
a large role in the world's global food supply: Russia is the largest
wheat exporter in the world, Brazil is the largest soybean exporter and
the third-largest corn exporter, and India is the largest rice exporter.
Similarly, Russia, India, and China's influences on the global energy
market are significant, as Russia is the largest oil exporter and
second-largest natural gas exporter, and India and China play a
substantial role in the transition to clean energy. Furthermore, China
and Russia have expressed a large interest in expanding the coalition
further. Specifically, China recently invited Saudi Arabia, Argentina,
Kazakhstan, Egypt, UAE, Indonesia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Thailand to
join the group, and Iran has applied for membership. The possible
addition of these countries to BRICS should concern the West as all are
significant players in the global economy.

Furthermore, the war in Ukraine and the ensuing sanctions against Russia
have pushed the BRICS nations closer together in recent months. As
global oil prices have increased to as high as \$120 per barrel due to a
decreased supply in the market, the incentive for non-western nations to
buy Russian oil has also grown as Russian oil hovers around \$30-35 per
barrel. Consequently, countries such as India and China have
dramatically increased their imports of Russian crude oil. For example,
in the first six months of 2022, India purchased nearly 60 million
barrels of Russian oil, which is up from only 12 million in all of 2021.
Additionally, South Africa recently stated that it is considering
purchasing Russian oil. Moreover, trade between Russia and the other
BRICS nations has increased, according to Russian President Vladimir
Putin. Putin claims that trade with China, India, Brazil, and South
Africa increased by 38% during the first quarter of 2022. Not only has
the war strengthened economic ties between the states, but in some ways
it appears to be helping resolve disputes. For example, as China and
India tightened their relationships with Russia earlier this year,
tensions between the two states on the Himalayan border have declined.
As the ties between the BRICS nations deepen in the wake of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, their influence over developing nations has
likewise increased.

[Russia and China have used Western sanctions against Russia and the war
in Ukraine as an opportunity to increase their influence over the Global
South]{.underline}. The two nations have [projected BRICS as "a powerful
emerging market alternative to the West,"]{.underline} while spreading
anti-western disinformation and propaganda throughout Africa.
Consequently, more [developing states have been less likely to support
the U.S. and Europe's condemnation of Russia]{.underline}, as
demonstrated by the Latin and South American, Caribbean, and African
countries that abstained from the UN vote condemning Russia's invasion.
Furthermore, [countries in the Global South are losing faith in the
Western world order]{.underline}, as the [U.S. pays less and less
attention to developing nations]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [BRICS
nations]{.underline}, most notably China, [have turned their attention
to them]{.underline}.

#### An infinite laundry list of alt causes thump -- the coalition is cooked

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for a third consecutive
term in office on Sunday, despite his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
losing its outright majority in India\'s elections.

Having failed to repeat its previous two landslide victories, [the Hindu
nationalist party will now need to rely on its partners in the ruling
National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition to govern. Key
members]{.underline} of the [[NDA]{.mark}]{.underline} have endorsed
Modi as their leader, but [[also demanded significant
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark} [in exchange for their
support.]{.underline}

Modi\'s tough juggling act

\"They have been kept in good humor for now but the demands and
arm-twisting by coalition partners will increase which is bound to
derail the BJP\'s wish list had they managed to win power on their
own,\" said Vikrant Singh, a political research analyst. \"**[[The BJP
is living on borrowed support.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Both the Telugu Desam Party, a key regional player in the southeastern
state of Andhra Pradesh, and the Janata Dal, which rules the northern
state of Bihar, are considered kingmakers in Modi\'s coalition and have
been rewarded with ministerial positions in the new cabinet.

The BJP won 240 seats in the general election, a significant dip from
its tally of 303 in 2019. A government requires the support of 272
lawmakers in the 543-member lower house of parliament, and the BJP fell
32 seats short of a majority.

What do the coalition partners want?

The [[Janata Dal]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[asked the BJP to
amend]{.underline}]{.mark} its controversial [[\'Agniveer\'
scheme]{.underline}]{.mark}, a military recruitment reform program to
create short-term employment and a caste-based census, according to
local reports.

The [[T]{.underline}]{.mark}elugu [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}esam
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty, meanwhile, is likely to [[demand a special
status for Andhra Pradesh]{.underline}]{.mark} which would lead to
grants and increased funding for the state.

Gilles Verniers, a political science expert at the Centre for Policy
Research in New Delhi, told DW that the stability of the coalition
depends more on the ability of the main party to lead in a spirit of
conciliation and effective power sharing.

\"Much [[depends on the willingness]{.underline}]{.mark} and ability of
the PM [[to change the way he practiced politics]{.mark}]{.underline}
during the first 23 years of his career. Coalition politics cannot
function as a one-way street,\" he said.

While India is not new to coalition governments, which existed in the
1980s and \'90s, analysts and political parties have pointed out that
they go against the grain of Modi\'s style of functioning.

\"Coalition politics is always marked by actions that are accommodative.
**[[Modi is not a consensus builder or a
reconciler]{.mark}]{.underline}** like former Prime Minister A B
Vajpayee of the BJP was. He is not an administrator, just an ideological
vote catcher,\" Sagarika Ghose, newly appointed deputy leader from the
Trinamool Congress in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of parliament,
told DW.

\"**[[The BJP has have not even worked out a common minimum program of
governance with its allies,]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" she added.

Will a weakened BJP get things done?

Following India\'s 2019 national elections, the BJP majority allowed it
to take monumental steps during its first 100 days in office, such as
revoking the special autonomous status of the Muslim-majority state of
Jammu and Kashmir and criminalizing the Islamic practice of \"triple
talaq,\" in which a husband utters the word \"divorce\" three times in
succession to his wife to end a marriage.

During the 2024 election campaign, the BJP promised significant reforms,
such as the implementation of the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), which sought
to replace religion-based personal laws governing issues such as
marriage, divorce and cohabitation with a common set of rules that apply
equally to all citizens.

Another contentious election pledge was that it would adopt the One
Nation One Election (ONOE) initiative, which envisages holding elections
to India\'s lower house of parliament (Lok Sabha) at the same time as
votes for state assemblies, municipalities and village councils
(panchayats) --- once every five years.

But with the BJP losing its majority, these issues are likely to be
relegated to the back burner due to potential resistance from the
party\'s new coalition partners.

\"In the present case, conciliation would mean to temporarily renounce
transforming India\'s constitutional order towards a formal majoritarian
system,\" said Verniers.

\"The BJP would also have to respond to its partners\' desire for a
caste census. But otherwise, whether this new coalition will have the
same moderating effect as during the first NDA governments of the late
1990s remains to be seen,\" he added.

Modi under scrutiny from coalition allies

[The BJP\'s big plans on the economic front, such as [opening certain
sectors to]{.mark} [f]{.mark}oreign [d]{.mark}irect [i]{.mark}nvestment,
manufacturing reforms [and foreign policy]{.mark} issues [may not
meet]{.mark} with much [resistance]{.mark}. However, there will be
pressures to tailor such reforms to meet regional mandates, especially
from alliance partners.]{.underline}

With an impressive showing by the opposition INDIA bloc that bagged 234
seats, Modi\'s critics will now press their agenda both inside and
outside parliament, putting the government under scrutiny over every
major legislation push.

\"[The new [coalition]{.mark} government [has]{.mark} just [too many
internal contradictions and ideological differences.]{.mark} **[It will
be just a matter of time before it
self-destructs.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Also remember, some of the [[key
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} supporting the government have secular
credentials and [[do not share the BJP\'s Hindu first
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Ram Pratap Singh, political
secretary of the Samajwadi Party.

Shabnam Hashmi, a political rights activist, also pointed out that the
new coalition is replete with inherent contradictions. She said its
members could ill afford to compromise on important issues such as
reservation, or affirmative action, for Muslims and caste-based census.

\"But it is important to understand that fascist forces do not leave
easily,\" said Hashmi. \"The BJP will try and break the other parties
and gain numbers over the next year.\"

### 2AC---No Link

#### There is currently no anti-American bloc in India parliament, and fears of china ensure support for India-US cooperation

**Latham and Kochel 24** \[Andrew Latham and Will Kochel \"What an even
stronger Modi might mean for US-India relations\", 05/30/2024,

Additionally, India is increasingly trying to position itself as the
voice of the Global South, which often puts it in opposition to American
and European interests. India has one of the strongest militaries in
Asia and the ability to project power regionally. The Indian Ocean's
name is no coincidence. India will not give up regional hegemony without
a fight.

To achieve these goals, India cannot play second fiddle to America
forever. It is increasingly clear that India's strategic approach is to
keep its options open so it can take advantage of whatever side best
suits its interests.

This is not to imply that there will be an imminent breakup. For the
time being, there is a growing bipartisan understanding in Washington
that China is the largest long-term threat to American security, which
makes for a natural partnership with [[India,]{.underline}]{.mark} which
[[fears Chinese territorial encroachment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [India's
threat perceptions seem to be locked in after military crises in 2014,
2017, 2020, and 2022.]{.underline}

As of now, [[the BJP is positioned to maintain
power]{.underline}]{.mark} after the 2024 election, [[making it unlikely
to impact the trajectory of the relationship]{.mark} **[barring an
unforeseen anti-American faction gaining footing.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Should the party expand its hold over Parliament[[, the surface of the
relationship may remain the same]{.underline}]{.mark}, but centralizing
Modi's power would only exacerbate his authoritarian and hawkish
leanings.

Still, India's growing illiberalism shouldn't be a barrier for the
moment. The United States has a long history of working with
dictatorships that have questionable human rights records. Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, and Pinochet-controlled Chile immediately come to mind. Security
interests frequently trump moral qualms.

But should the security situation change --- as a result of U.S.-China
rapprochement, a surprise change in Indian or American leadership, or a
crisis of credibility --- policymakers may find that there is not much
at the core of the relationship. India may be useful to American
strategists who want to balance China for now, but make no mistake,
India will not sacrifice its core interests to appease the United
States. [[Security relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} can seem
**[[momentarily strong]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but they are a house of
cards vulnerable to shifting geopolitical winds.

India's Strategic Vision and Parliamentary Engagement:

[[Indian policymakers articulated a clear vision for the nation\'s role
in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. In a session titled "Vision from the
Indian Parliament," Members of Parliament Milind Deora and Anurag Thakur
[[emphasized the need for proactive engagement,]{.underline}]{.mark}
noting the Arctic's direct influence on India's climate, economy, and
water security. Deora emphasized the symbolic and practical significance
of India's observer role in the Arctic Council and encouraged expanding
India's policy and research footprint in the region. Minister of
External Affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar echoed these views[, further [warning
of the Arctic\'s emerging role as a theatre of power competition, where
actors like China are increasingly active in scientific, commercial, and
strategic domains]{.mark}. The Minister [noted that India]{.mark}'s
presence and diplomacy [must remain dynamic and forward-looking in
response to this]{.mark} evolving environment.]{.underline}

Scientific Collaboration and Climate Research:

[[Scientific cooperation formed a central pillar]{.mark} of the forum.
Panels on Arctic-Asian climate interlinkages brought together
researchers from India, Japan, and South Korea to discuss the Arctic's
role in shaping Asia's monsoon systems and long-term climate
variability. India's Himadri research station in Svalbard was
highlighted as a vital base for collaborative polar research.
**[Speakers underlined the importance of strengthening scientific
alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline} to decode cascading climate impacts on
agriculture, water systems, and biodiversity, especially in vulnerable
regions such as South Asia.

Technological Advancements and Sustainable Development:

Sessions on satellite observation, earth sciences, and space-based data
sharing showcased the importance of technology in Arctic engagement.
Experts from India and Europe discussed space cooperation, disaster risk
reduction, and surveillance systems tailored for polar environments. The
forum also emphasized the potential of blue economy initiatives,
maritime security partnerships --- especially between India and Nordic
states --- and the role of sustainable Arctic resource management.
Discussions reiterated that as Arctic access increases, so do the risks
of environmental exploitation and geopolitical rivalry.

### 2AC---Mediation Checks

#### Mediation, backchannels, and regional players check escalation in Kashmir

**Biswas and Pandey 25** \[Soutik Biswas and Vikas Pandey, \"India and
Pakistan: How backchannels and US mediators pulled rivals back from the

// Micah

In a dramatic turn of events, US President Donald Trump took to social
media on Saturday to announce that India and Pakistan - after four tense
days of cross-border clashes - had agreed to a \"full and immediate
ceasefire\".

[Behind the scenes, US [mediators]{.mark}, alongside diplomatic
[backchannels]{.mark} [and regional players]{.mark}, proved critical in
[pull]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} nuclear-armed [rivals back from the
brink]{.mark}, experts say.]{.underline}

However, hours after a ceasefire deal, India and Pakistan were trading
accusations of fresh violations - underscoring its fragility.

India accused Pakistan of \"repeated violations\" while Pakistan
insisted it remained committed to the ceasefire, with its forces showing
\"responsibility and restraint.\"

Before Trump\'s ceasefire announcement, India and Pakistan were
spiralling towards what many feared could become a full-blown conflict.

After a deadly militant attack killed 26 tourists in Indian-administered
Kashmir last month, India launched air strikes inside Pakistan and
Pakistan-administered Kashmir - triggering days of aerial clashes,
artillery duels and, by Saturday morning, accusations from both sides of
missile strikes on each other\'s airbases.

The rhetoric escalated sharply, with each country claiming to have
inflicted heavy damage while foiling the other\'s attacks.

Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington
DC, says US Secretary of State Marco Rubio\'s call to Pakistani Army
Chief Asim Munir on 9 May \"might have been the crucial point\".

\"There\'s still much we don\'t know about the roles of various
international actors, but [[it\'s clear]{.mark} over the past three days
that at least [three countries were working to
de-escalate]{.mark}]{.underline} - the US, of course, but also the UK
and Saudi Arabia,\" she says.

Pakistan\'s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told Pakistani media that
\"[three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy - including
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the US.]{.underline}

\"One question is whether, if this call had come earlier - right after
the initial Indian strikes, when Pakistan was already claiming some
Indian losses and an off-ramp was available - it might have prevented
further escalation,\" Ms Madan says.

[[This isn\'t the first time]{.underline}]{.mark} [US [mediation
has]{.mark} [helped defuse]{.mark} an [India--Pakistan]{.mark}
crisis.]{.underline}

In his memoir, former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed he was
woken up to speak with an unnamed \"Indian counterpart\", who feared
Pakistan was preparing nuclear weapons during the 2019 standoff.

between India and Pakistan, in Srinagar, May 10, 2025.Reuters

Former Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria later wrote
that Pompeo overstated both the risk of nuclear escalation and the US
role in calming the conflict.

But diplomats say [[there is little doubt the US played an important
role]{.underline}]{.mark} in defusing the crisis this time.

\"The US was the most prominent external player. Last time, Pompeo
claimed they averted nuclear war. While they\'ll likely exaggerate, they
may have played the primary diplomatic role, perhaps amplifying Delhi\'s
positions in Islamabad,\" Mr Bisaria told the BBC on Saturday.

Yet at the outset, the US appeared strikingly standoffish.

As tensions flared, US Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday that the
US was not going to get involved in a war that\'s \"fundamentally none
of our business\".

\"We can\'t control these countries though. Fundamentally, India has its
gripes with Pakistan\... America can\'t tell the Indians to lay down
their arms. We can\'t tell the Pakistanis to lay down their arms. And so
we\'re going to continue to pursue this thing through diplomatic
channels, \" he said in a television interview.

Meanwhile, President Trump said earlier this week: \"I know both
\[leaders of India and Pakistan\] very well, and I want to see them work
it out\... I want to see them stop, and hopefully they can stop now\".

India, in Hyderabad, Sindh province

Ejaz Haider, a Lahore-based defence analyst, told the BBC this appeared
to be the only difference from previous occasions.

\"[[The American role was a continuation of past
patterns]{.underline}]{.mark}, but with one key difference - this time,
they initially stayed hands-off, watching the crisis unfold instead of
jumping in right away. Only when they saw how it was playing out did
they step in to manage it,\" Mr Haider told the BBC.

Experts in Pakistan say as the escalation cycle deepened, Pakistan sent
\"dual signals\", retaliating militarily while announcing a National
Command Authority (NCA) meeting - a clear reminder of the nuclear
overhang.

### 2AC---War inevitable

#### War in Kashmir is an inevitable cycle of violence, ceasefires, and violence again. It is an existential necessity for each state to continue the violence.

This **[[Ceasefire Will Not Hold]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [Because
[India and Pakistan Were Never Meant to Coexist:]{.mark}]{.underline} On
May 16, 2025, India and Pakistan agreed -- yet again -- to a ceasefire
along the Line of Control in Kashmir. The language was familiar. So were
the rituals: hotlines activated, diplomats deployed, photo ops arranged.

And once again, the usual chorus of analysts and think tankers emerged
to declare this a "positive development," a "step toward de-escalation,"
or even, God help us, a "ray of hope." But the truth is far more
sobering: [[this ceasefire, like the dozen before it, is a
mirage]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is not a harbinger of peace[[. It is a
pause, born of exhaustion, political necessity, and international
pressure --]{.mark} a tactical breath [before the next inevitable
exhalation of violence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[The Kashmir War Isn't Over]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[This is not cynicism. It is realism. And if we are honest, it is also
clarity. Because [the conflict]{.mark} between India and Pakistan is not
simply about territory. It [is about incompatible national
identities]{.mark} that [cannot be reconciled]{.mark} [without
one]{.mark} state fundamentally [repudiating its founding
purpose]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The problem is not Kashmir. **[[Kashmir is the symptom. The disease is
deeper.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

To understand why this ceasefire will fail, we must return to the moment
of partition in 1947, when the British Raj -- decaying, depleted, and
desperate to leave -- abandoned the subcontinent to two emerging states.
But they were not merely two states. They were two mutually exclusive
civilizational projects.

India, for all its contradictions and flaws, has long insisted it is a
secular, multiethnic, and multi-confessional republic. Pakistan, by
contrast, was founded explicitly as a homeland for South Asia's Muslims
-- a state forged out of the belief that Muslims and Hindus could not
coexist in a single polity. India's national identity is tethered to
unity amid diversity; Pakistan's to the safeguarding of Islamic identity
through separation[[. Kashmir,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the only
Muslim-majority princely state to accede to India]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[became the living]{.underline}]{.mark} [contradiction of both. And it
is a **[contradiction that neither side can allow to resolve on the
other's terms.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[For India, Kashmir is the litmus test of its secular
promise]{.underline}]{.mark} -- proof that a Muslim-majority state can
thrive inside a Hindu-majority nation**[. To relinquish it would be to
concede that the secular project has failed, that Pakistan was right all
along.]{.underline}** [[For Pakistan, Kashmir is the unfinished business
of partition]{.underline}]{.mark}, the wound left open by a
Hindu-majority state holding dominion over a Muslim-majority land. **[To
let it go would be to admit that the two-nation theory was a strategic
error, that the state was built on a myth.]{.underline}**

In short: **[[for either state to compromise on Kashmir is to deny the
reason for its own existence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[This is the tragic engine that drives the conflict. It is not about
borders, rivers, or insurgencies. It is about identity -- and identity,
unlike territory, does not admit easy negotiation. **[When political
projects are rooted in irreconcilable myths of nationhood, conflict
becomes not the failure of diplomacy but the natural state of
affairs.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

But nuclear escalation can happen by accident too. \"This could happen
by human error, hackers, terrorists, computer failures, bad data from
satellites and unstable leaders,\" Prof Alan Robock of Rutgers
University, lead author of the landmark 2019 paper by a global team of
scientists, told the BBC.

In March 2022, India accidentally fired a nuclear-capable cruise missile
which travelled 124km (77 miles) into Pakistani territory before
crashing, reportedly damaging civilian property. Pakistan said India
failed to use the military hotline or issue a public statement for two
days. Had this occurred during heightened tensions, the incident could
have spiralled into serious conflict, experts say. (Months later,
India\'s government sacked three air force officers for the \"accidental
firing of a missile\".)

Yet, the [[danger of nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark} remains
\"**[[relatively small\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between India and
Pakistan, according to Mr Clary.]{.underline}

\"[So long as there is not major ground combat along the border, the
dangers of nuclear use remain relatively small and manageable,\" he
said.]{.underline}

\"In ground combat, the \'use it or lose it\' problem is propelled by
the possibility that your ground positions will be overrun by the
enemy.\" (\'Use it or lose it\' refers to the pressure a nuclear-armed
country may feel to launch its weapons before they are destroyed in a
first strike by an adversary.)

[Sumit Ganguly, a senior fellow at Stanford University\'s Hoover
Institution, believes that]{.underline} \"[[neither India nor Pakistan
wants to be labelled as the first violator of the post-Hiroshima nuclear
taboo\".]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"Furthermore, [[any side]{.underline}]{.mark} [that resorts to the use
of nuclear weapons]{.underline} [[would]{.mark} face substantial
retaliation and [suffer unacceptable casualties]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
Mr Ganguly told the BBC.

At the same time, both India and Pakistan appear to be beefing up their
nuclear arsenal.

With new delivery systems in development, four plutonium reactors and
expanding uranium enrichment, Pakistan\'s nuclear arsenal could reach
around 200 warheads by the late 2020s, according to The Nuclear
Notebook, researched by the Federation of American Scientists\' Nuclear
Information Project.

And as of early 2023, India was estimated to have about 680kg of
weapons-grade plutonium - enough for roughly 130-210 nuclear warheads,
according to the International Panel on Fissile Materials.

Despite repeated crises and close calls, both sides have so far managed
to avoid a catastrophic slide into nuclear conflict. \"**[[The deterrent
is still holding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [All Pakistanis did was to
respond to conventional strikes with counter-conventional strikes of
their own,\" writes Umer Farooq, an Islamabad-based
analyst.]{.underline}

Yet, the presence of nuclear weapons injects a constant undercurrent of
risk - one that can never be entirely ruled out, no matter how
experienced the leadership or how restrained the intentions.

\"When nuclear weapons can be involved, there is always an unacceptable
level of danger,\"John Erath, senior policy director at the non-profit
Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, told the BBC.

Nazism and Italy to fascism]{.underline} --- and events have justified
those -isms."

Given such events reduced Europe to the bloodlands of World War II, Modi
now wishes the same for South Asia: Pakistan and India have been closest
to war in half a century; fighter jets tango overhead; and a new
generation wakes up to the sirens their grandparents once had to.

At [[the brink of war,]{.underline}]{.mark} again

[But we're here now, and it [mostly has to do with Delhi's own
neuroses]{.mark}: the rabid base, the status anxiety, and an occupation
that refuses to resolve itself[. Modi's annexation drive in Kashmir was
demographic change 101;]{.mark} the "[Muslim problem]{.mark}", to quote
Savarkar, [would be resolved, even if India had to shred its own supreme
law]{.mark} to do it.]{.underline}

But no one asked Kashmir's sons and daughters. The Pahalgam attack
wasn't a cause; it was a reply --- one that came on the heels of mass
murder and repression.

Even here, however, Pakistan's response was to condemn it, call for a
neutral probe, and talk up peace. India's response was to try and choke
the water supply to an entire civilian population, fire missiles at a
three-year-old girl, and name its operation after the hair choices of
married Hindu women.

Because Modi takes the same policy decision each time there's a Kashmir
crisis: to externalise it to Pakistan, and then scream revenge. For Uri
in 2016, for Pulwama in 2019, for Pahalgam today. The evidence provided
--- for an accusation that could lead to nuclear war and the end of the
world: none yet.

Instead, the prime minister has again rushed to the border on fumes: at
the close of India's saffron decade, Modi has fed off his manic base,
and his base has fed off him --- **[[peace is political
suicide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Every election demands a war, and
every corpse is campaign fodder.]{.underline}]{.mark}

More the pity for his Western allies, long banking on India as the
region's net security provider. But while the '20s may vary from century
to century, a Nazi is still a Nazi.

Not only is it the direct effect of these cuts, it is also the
[uncertainty created by these **rapid policy changes** that is damaging
to the **scientific community**]{.underline}. [Researchers, clinical
trials and public health agencies need **stable**, **predictable**
funding environments to plan and execute **long-term
studies**]{.underline}. [The current atmosphere of **confusion** and
**unpredictability** makes it difficult for scientists to make
**informed decisions** about their **research programs** and
careers]{.underline}. Even if policies are reversed or blocked in the
coming months, the damage already done will take years to repair. The
loss of experienced personnel, disruption of ongoing research and
erosion of institutional knowledge cannot be quickly restored. This
cascading effect means that even a temporary period of instability can
have repercussions that extend well beyond the immediate crisis.

The dismantling of programs aimed at ensuring equal opportunities for
people with disabilities and from underrepresented backgrounds is
troubling. This comes at a crucial moment when we are finally seeing
meaningful progress in broadening participation in science. The
[cancelled programs have **expanded** the talent pool for **scientific
research** and enriched the scientific enterprise by fostering
**innovation** through **diverse perspectives**]{.underline}. Rolling
them back threatens to reverse hard-won gains, and it risks squandering
the potential contributions of historically underrepresented groups to
scientific discovery.

It is particularly disappointing to see some non-governmental
organisations appearing to adopt similar policies, even when not
required to do so by federal mandate. While the situation is complex
even for those not reliant on federal support, these institutions have
historically provided stability during periods of political upheaval,
and their independent leadership is needed now more than ever.

The impact on public health is a major concern. [Defunding ongoing
research initiatives threatens to stall **years** of **progress**, both
in the USA and internationally]{.underline}. Programs that have saved
countless lives through vaccination initiatives and through HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment are being cancelled. Scaling back these
initiatives and cancelling research that will underpin future programs
is not only ethically questionable, but also economically short-sighted.
The long-term costs of decreased public health interventions -- both in
terms of human lives and economic burden -- far outweigh any short-term
financial savings.

At the NSF, recent developments have particular significance for climate
science research. The timing could not be worse. The world faces
unprecedented environmental challenges. The NSF\'s support for climate
science, environmental monitoring and sustainable technology development
has been fundamental to our understanding of environmental challenges.
Interference with this work -- whether through direct funding cuts or
censorship -- threatens to undermine international efforts to address
the climate crisis at a time when accelerated action is desperately
needed.

But it is not just about the funding cuts. Our journals support open
science and promote scientific rigour. We are concerned with policies
that appear to threaten censorship, restrictions on terminology and the
removal of public datasets. We are committed to maintaining editorial
policies, scientific standards and data openness in our journals. We are
determined to protect inclusivity, scientific rigour and the peer review
process.

Potential Effects on Science

[Uncertainty around **research funding** can lead to **decreased
innovation**]{.underline}, according to Daniel Michele, PhD, professor
and chair of the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology at
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and chair of the APS Science
Policy Committee. Michele emphasizes that he speaks as a scientist and
chair of the APS committee and not on behalf of the university.

"[When funding is tight, scientists become more
**conservative**]{.underline}," he says. "[They cannot risk the
remaining funding they have left for their lab]{.underline}, so [they
have to **propose** and do the **safest experiments** that are most
likely to be **productive**]{.underline}. As a consequence, [innovation
is stymied]{.underline}. [Many **groundbreaking discoveries** are made
by creative experiments that require **exploratory**
**funding**]{.underline}."

Exploration and innovation often take years. When it comes to bringing
new drugs and treatments to market, funding is critical. Michele cites a
study published in the April 2023 JAMA Health Forum that showed 356 new
Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs between 2010 and 2019 were
funded by NIH.

"Most of those drugs took almost 15 to 20 years to move from basic
research discovery to a new drug," Michele says. "A [reduction in
funding]{.underline} not only slows the development of new drugs but
[could also lead to projects **being** **canceled** and a huge **loss**
of a **15- to 20-year investment** in that discovery]{.underline}."

[Science is **not quick**]{.underline}, particularly for physiologists
who are conducting whole system and whole organism-level experiments.
"[They're planned out for **weeks**, **months** and **years** at a
time]{.underline}," Wolinetz says. "It's hard to imagine these actions
won't slow the pace of research enormously and potentially delay the
outcomes of that research for years."

India's Indo-Pacific strategy, built on collaboration with democratic
allies to uphold a free and open region, offers a proven model that can
be adapted for the Arctic. In the Indo-Pacific, India has actively
engaged with countries like the US, Japan, and Australia, emphasising
shared values such as freedom of navigation and rule of law59) This
model not only reflects India's own values but also reinforces its role
as a stabilising force in a region marked by rising Chinese influence.
[Replicating this approach in the Arctic could allow India to promote a
similar vision of **openness** and **cooperation**]{.underline}, thereby
countering Russia's disruption in the region without directly
challenging its own Russia policies.

Aligning India's Arctic strategy with its Indo-Pacific vision would also
help solidify its role as a global balancing power---one that is
committed to a rules-based international order. [Unlike the
Indo-Pacific, where India's partnership with the US and other allies has
actively contributed to **regional s**tability]{.underline}, [in the
Arctic, India's current approach lacks a similar multilateral
dimension]{.underline}. Focusing on [partnerships with Arctic states

This was the moment when [Britain discovered just how damaging
**political populism** can be for **scientific
innovation**]{.underline}. And while the episode is barely known in
America, it ought to make for sobering reading there, particularly as
President Donald Trump pushes his "big, beautiful" tax and spending bill
through both houses of Congress.

This is the story of the Lunar Society, a network of entrepreneurs,
scientists and curious citizens that emerged in Birmingham in the
mid-18th century. It was based around dinners held during the full moon
to aid travel (hence its name).

Over several decades, this network unleashed inventions that accelerated
the industrial revolution, including the discovery of oxygen and
carbonated water (by Joseph Priestley), advanced steam engines (James
Watt) and innovative ceramics (Josiah Wedgwood).

Think of it as an 18th-century version of Silicon Valley, a place where
innovation erupted because key individuals were close to each other and
operated in an intellectually diverse and free community with far fewer
political controls than in places such as London.

In 1791 Britain experienced a wave of political polarisation and
populism. Mobs attacked Lunar Society workshops, innovators such as
Priestly emigrated and the network crumbled. "The damage went beyond
physical destruction," David Cleevely, a British entrepreneur, notes in
a new book, Serendipity. "The riots sent a clear message about the
vulnerability of intellectual networks to political pressure . . . and a
climate of fear descended."

This resonates 234 years later. [In the US there has been a wave of
**hand-wringing** from scientists about Trump's **attack** on
**research**]{.underline}. At Harvard, for instance, \$2bn in funding
for (mostly) medical research is at risk because of the president's
political vendetta against the university. At Nasa, [half of the budget
for **scientific research** is at risk under Trump's 2026 funding
plans]{.underline}. [Billions of dollars are slated to be **wiped** from
the **N**ational **S**cience **F**oundation and **N**ational
**I**nstitutes **o**f **H**ealth budgets too]{.underline}.

Indeed, Cassidy Sugimoto, a professor of public policy at Georgia
Institute of Technology, suggested this week in London that the totality
of Trump's moves meant that science faced a "50 per cent cut" in all US
government research funding. "Trump has cut science funding to its
lowest levels in decades," she lamented.

But what is as notable as these numbers is the fear aroused by Trump's
political attacks on "woke" causes (like diversity) and the science that
his populist supporters dislike (such as vaccine research). This is not
just affecting institutions such as Harvard; American scientists tell me
that research programmes are being culled across the country if they
contain controversial words or prefixes like "trans-", "bi-" or "gender"
--- even if used in connection with, say, "binary stars" or "transgenic"
mice.

"It's Orwellian --- like an artificial intelligence program just cuts
anything with those words," one eminent mathematician tells me.

In response, scientists are swapping secretive notes about how to avoid
the censors. Internal battles have erupted at prestigious institutions
such as the US National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine
about whether or not to capitulate to Trump.

Meanwhile, some scientists are leaving. In April the journal Nature
calculated that [**job applications** by US scientists to institutions
in Canada, Europe and non-China Asia were **41** per cent, **32** per
cent and **39** per cent higher respectively in **2025** than
**2024**]{.underline}. And this week France proudly unveiled its first
official group of US "scientific refugees": an eight-strong cohort of
researchers who are heading to Aix-Marseille university.

### 2AC---N/L---India Key

#### India research cooperation key to de-securitize

**Sharma 21** \[Bipandeep Sharma is a Research Analyst at

Defence Studies and Analysis, New Delhi. He is also a doctoral candidate

Ole Wæver initially defined de-securitisation as a securitisation move
that fails due to the target audience refusing to accept the authority
and legitimacy of an initial securitisation move (Wæver, 1998, p. 56).
This definition stands broadened in the sense that 'issues could be
deliberately de-securitised not in consequence of any audience failure
to accept securitisation, but as a deliberate "positive"
normative-political move to reject the "exceptional" realm of security
politics' (Austin & Brossard, 2017, p. 6). Emerging issues of the Arctic
that are on the high verge of 'securitisation' need to be deliberately
addressed through such 'positive normative-political de-securitisation
moves'. To achieve de-securitisation Copenhagen School outlines three
strategies: (a) not to talk about issues in terms of security in the
first place; (b) managing securitisation (if issues got securitised) and
preventing security dilemmas and vicious circles; and (c) moving
securitised issues back to normal politics (Wæver, 2000). The
transforming Arctic presents multiple issues that are at different
levels of attaining securitisation; therefore [all these
strategies]{.underline} outlined by the Copenhagen School [could be
applied to achieve de-securitisation in the region.]{.underline} The
emerging issues of the Arctic[, such as environment, ecology, human and
connectivity, need to be]{.underline} addressed as issues of common
global concern and [approached through mutual cooperation. Issues
regarding Arctic resources and territorial claims over land and ocean
could be managed by strictly adhering to international laws and through
mutual cooperation between states to avoid any further security
dilemmas.]{.underline} Issues of traditional military build-ups and
other hard security measures in the region could be addressed through
both military and non-military Confidence Building Measures and other
such unilateral and multilateral initiatives to bring them back to
normal politics. Emerging Arctic issues that possess global challenges
need not be looked at through narrowly framed regional or one particular
state's interests but should be addressed through combined global
efforts and as per UN sustainable development goals.

[Asian states especially India could play a constructive role in solving
these]{.underline} emerging [Arctic issues through its long history and
experience of polar science research in Hindu Kush Himalayas and
Antarctica]{.underline} (Chaturvedi, 2014, p. 78). [India's scientific
engagements in the Arctic]{.underline} mainly [focus on climate research
by studying Arctic sea ice variations and their links with Indian
monsoons]{.underline} (Ministry of External Affairs, 2013).
[India's]{.underline} focused [approach]{.underline} mainly [in terms of
scientific research in the Arctic justifies the country's]{.underline}
serious [commitments towards understanding and addressing emerging
issues of human--environment context]{.underline} that have global
implications for mankind. India, with its large coastal population
residing in coastal cities and a significant part of the country's gross
domestic product coming from its agriculture sector (Government of
India, 2020), simply cannot afford to neglect the future consequences of
climate emerging from the transforming Arctic. Environmental challenges
from the Arctic will not only impact Indian agriculture and coastal
communities but many other Asian states with large coastal cities and
populations centres will also become vulnerable to these drastic changes
in future. Therefore, India along with other Asian states needs to at
least collaborate on all these issues that bear common implications for
Asian region. The basic fundamental argument that Asian states could
collectively put here is that the Arctic needs to be preserved for its
wilderness to remain as 'Arctic'. Only the Arctic five could not set
rules for the region that is on a brink of posing global challenges.

In addition to insights provided by Copenhagen School's theoretical
approach to de-securitisation, [India's traditional philosophical
approach of *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* can play a new constructive role in
de-securitising the Arctic.]{.underline} The philosophy of *Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam*, which traces its origins in ancient Indian texts of Maha
Upanishads is composed of three words: 'Vasudha' which means 'earth',
'Iva' which means 'is' and 'Kutumbakam' means 'the family'. So, this
combined phrase reads as 'the world is one family'. This ancient Indian
philosophy argues that the entire humanity is one family and is made of
one life energy. The fundamental pillars of *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* are
love and harmony, cooperation and mutual support, feelings of kinship
and relationship (Lakhanpal, 2018). [Therefore, emerging issues of
environment, Arctic biodiversity, resources, routes and scientific
research could be addressed through]{.underline} such [a proactive
normative approach of mutual cooperation]{.underline} and global
harmony. The context of *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* in the Arctic should not
be misunderstood as something in cognisance to the concept of 'global
commons' (Nanda, 2019, p. 12) nor it should be confused with the
controversial call of 'the Arctic as a common heritage of mankind'
(Brady, 2017, p. 16). [India]{.underline} should rather [call
for *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* as a positive normative philosophical
approach in the Arctic for 'addressing' those issues of the region
(]{.underline}termed as threats) [that impacts global
mankind]{.underline} and are otherwise on a verge of getting securitised
through security discourses of the dominant five. Such an approach of
[cooperation and solidarity in the Arctic can generate a space for
mutual trust rather than conflicts.]{.underline} Further, *Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam* in the Arctic needs to be promoted with due adherence to
solving other complex issues of the region (such as issues of
territorial sovereignty and international navigation) through mutual
cooperation amongst the Arctic states and as per international laws.
This way India's ancient philosophical approach of *Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam* could bring those issues of the region out of the realm of
security politics which are common to global mankind but are getting
securitised in the face of protecting dominant Arctic state's national
interests in the region. The Arctic council to date does not maintain
any formal channel for cooperation on military matters, apart from some
other informal mechanisms such as the Annual Chief of Defence Staff
meeting and Arctic Security Forces Round Table (Moe, 2016). Therefore,
[India's *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* as a guiding philosophy to any future
formal]{.underline} or informal [setup for cooperation on military
matters in the Arctic could]{.underline} bring a new perspective in
[de-securitisi]{.underline}ng [the region.]{.underline} Such guiding
philosophy at its core would even be with due adherence to all the
postulates laid out for member states in the Arctic council which would
further facilitate peace and cooperation in the region.

Most [Indian commentators envisage the Arctic as a "global
commons"]{.underline} or a "common heritage of mankind" in need of
protection. Accordingly, [India insists that it has a right to conduct
scientific research and contribute to responsible environmental
management.]{.underline} Although this concept resonates with India‟s
experiences in Antarctica, it bristles against the perspectives of
Arctic coastal states and Northern peoples who exercise sovereignty and
sovereign rights to Arctic lands, waters, and seabed resources in
conformity with international law. Saran‟s warnings that Arctic Council
observer status is tantamount to accepting "the sovereign rights of the
Arctic Council members over the Arctic Ocean" (1 February 2012) is
misleading insofar as these rights are derived from UNCLOS and customary
international law, not the Council. The extent to which the "global
commons" envisaged by Indian commentators seeks to diminish Arctic state
rights -- both geographically and functionally -- remains unclear.

Some [Indian commentators suggest that international efforts should be
directed towards stopping Arctic resource development, slowing climate
change, and preserving the region.]{.underline} In his latest
intervention, Saran (15 July 2013) urges the United Nations "to set up
its own Arctic body" and suggests that India and other developing states
might "[put the Arctic on the agenda of the ongoing multilateral
negotiations on Climate Change]{.underline} under the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change" and thus "[ensure that the activities
undertaken there do not harm the wellbeing of the vast majority of
people around the world.]{.underline}" He reiterates his earlier
arguments that:

\[I\]t is hypocritical of the developed, industrialized countries, in
particular, the rich Arctic states, to preach low carbon development
strategies to poor, developing countries, while they themselves, rush
headlong into ensuring the perpetuation of their own carbon and fossil
fuel intensive patterns of production and consumption. This hypocrisy
lies at the heart of the relentless spoilage and ravaging of one of the
last pristine frontiers of our endangered planet. If we keep silent and
look away because of the prospect of sharing in this unseemly Gold Rush,
India‟s credentials as a responsible member of the international
community and as a champion of the principle of equitable burden-sharing
and inter-generational equity, would become deeply suspect.

Other commentators indicate that [India needs to]{.underline} enhance
its knowledge and devise a robust strategy to exploit Arctic resources,
prepare for impacts that new Arctic shipping routes may have on existing
trade networks, and [pursue opportunities for multilateral and bilateral
cooperation with Arctic states within the existing legal and governance
regime]{.underline}. In raising the question of why non-Arctic states
(such as India) should trust the Arctic states, Chaturvedi reverses the
question frequently posed by established regional actors and highlights
the trust deficit that persists amongst and towards the "outsiders"
lobbying for a more central role on the Arctic stage (2012b: 232).

### 2AC---L/T---Environment

#### Security theory fails in the context of environmental issues\-\--it depoliticizes urgent issues while obscuring traditional security logics

Trombetta, 09 \[Maria Julia Trombetta has a PhD in international
politics from Aberystwyth University, a master in Environmental
Governance from the University of Pavia (European School for Advanced
Studies) and a MSc in Economic and Social Science from Bocconi
University. \"Environmental security and climate change: analysing the

The Copenhagen School warns about the risk of securitization and
distinguishes between securitization---'meaning the issue is presented
as an existential threat, requiring emergency measures and justifying
actions outside the normal bounds of political procedure'---and
politicization---'meaning the issue is part of public policy, requiring
government decision and resource allocations' (Buzan et al 1998, 23 --
24). The School warns that 'when considering securitizing moves such as
"environmental security" . . . one has to weigh the always problematic
side effects of applying a mind-set of security against the possible
advantages of focus, attention, and mobilization' (29) and Waever's
normative suggestion is: 'less security, more politics!' (Waever 1995,
56). [In the case of the environment this suggestion is
problematic]{.underline}. It [can lead to the depoliticization and
marginalization of urgent and serious issues, while]{.underline} leaving
the practices associated with [security unchallenged.]{.underline} Many
appeals to [environmental security have been made not only with the
intent of prioritizing issues but also with that of transforming the
logic of security]{.underline} and the practices associated with it. And
yet, [when applied to environmental issues, the process of
securitization does not seem to be]{.underline} analytically
[accurate]{.underline}. The Copenhagen School, in its empirically driven
analysis of various sectors in Security: a new framework for analysis,
has identiﬁed several peculiarities in the environmental sector (Buzanet
al 1998, 71 --94). Amongst these peculiarities the most noticeable is
that [few appeals to environmental security have mobilized exceptional
measures or inscribed enemies]{.underline} in any context. The
Copenhagen School has suggested that when the environment is involved,
'"emergency measures" are still designed and developed in the realm of
ordinary policy debates' (83). This [suggests that issues can be
politicized through an appeal to security]{.underline}, a
[problematic]{.underline} development for the Copenhagen School, [which
argues that 'transcending a security problem by politicising it cannot
happen through thematization in security terms, only away from such
terms']{.underline} (Waever 1995, 56). Even if the School tends to
dismiss [these as failed securitizations]{.underline}, this seems to
show that [the transformation of an issue into a security issue can
follow different modalities and]{.underline} different [logics, which
eschew the]{.underline} confrontational [logic of the national security
model]{.underline} suggested by the School. Through the appeal to
security, other logics, which characterize different contexts, can be
brought into existence and new actors can gain relevance in security

It is [very likely that water scarcity may become a huge challenge for
India]{.underline}. Delhi and Bangalore may soon not have enough water
to support the people living in these cities. India has enormous
problems but the [potential for solutions in India is]{.underline} much
[large]{.underline}r than the problems the country faces. Migration can
possibly become a problem for India as well; with floods and rise in sea
levels, more people will migrate from Bangladesh. Thus, [there is a
connection between dimensions of climate change and global security.
Climate change as a global problem presents a challenge to current
approaches to security policy.]{.underline} The present conference aims
at understanding how [climate change can influence]{.underline} our
[understanding of security policy]{.underline}. It is a difficult
question with a set of perhaps difficult answers.

It is [important to discuss climate change as a threat at global and
national levels]{.underline} and understand the implications for
traditional security at both national and global levels. Any debate or
discussion on any aspect of climate change gives rise to very strong
views and very strong thoughts. In fact, at one point of time in the
past, even the scientific evidence on climate change was disputed.
Fortunately that debate has been closed now. It is now a settled fact
that [the problem of climate change is real and urgent.]{.underline}

Some see climate change as a threat multiplier; apart from being an
environmental threat, [the impacts of climate change trespasses on
economic and socio-political systems and affect the survival of all
species on this planet.]{.underline} The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has called [climate change a global risk as climate
change will affect not only natural systems but also human
systems.]{.underline} The global risk of climate change thus has several
dimensions.

The Paris Agreement, which is a ratified treaty today, does not talk
about the peace and security issues directly but alludes to the concepts
of human rights and climate justice. In global debates on sustainable
development goals, Goal 16 talks about peace and justice. Depending on
the perspective and scientific evidence, [climate change can become a
serious threat having large implications on human security]{.underline}.
Linkages between climate change and climate action needs to be explored
from all issue areas including security and at global, regional,
national and sub-national levels.

How is climate change related to international security? In [the
post-Cold War period]{.underline}, with major military and political
change becoming less critical, the [idea of non-conventional threats to
security have become more prominent.]{.underline} This is not to imply
that the concern about non-conventional threats only began after the end
of the Cold War as there is no alternative superpower in the post-Cold
War period. Global balance of power is again changing with China being a
revisionist power. Therefore, the traditional security concerns are also
coming back. Non-traditional threats to security including the threats
from non-state actors and climate change have become a global concern.
For example, the question of non-state actors and the threat posed by
terrorist organizations along with the threat of large-scale migration
will continue to be causes of concerns.

While this may be speculation, [climate change is going to induce a
major change in geo-politics because the shape of land and water masses
are going to change]{.underline}. The Arctic is going to become more
navigable; it has the potential to become a major maritime route that
will be transpolar. This will also have major implications for
geopolitical trade and could change the existing military geography.

Why does climate change have implications for security concerns? Climate
change affects the physical geography of our planet [causing rise in sea
levels, desertification in many areas, and also redistribution of
resources particularly water]{.underline}. There are security
implications as though [climate change is]{.underline} slow and gradual,
it is not just a single threat; rather, it is [a threat
multiplier.]{.underline} Climate change will result in increase in
trends such as migrations from water stressed areas or heavily populated
areas to less populated areas. Due to sea level rise, if a large part of
Bangladesh goes under water, there will be a scenario of mass migration.

Since climate change can be seen as a threat multiplier, there is a
[need for substantial global cooperation not only for mitigation of
climate change but also to adapt to the impact of climate change.
International cooperation is required in areas such as agriculture,
health, and migration]{.underline}. There is a need for cooperation in
terms of finance and sharing technologies for effective climate change
adaptation. Developed countries need to transfer technologies in order
to make more vulnerable developing states resilient and ready to face
the threats posed by the impacts of climate change. This is not an act
of charity but rather a question of future planning to which the United
Nations system needs to pay much greater attention.

In recent weeks, [people around the globe have struggled with extreme
weather such as heatwaves, wildfires, drought, coastal erosion,
permafrost thawing and severe flooding]{.underline}. In Canada --- where
570 died from record heat in British Columbia and the entire town of
Lytton burned down, scorching temperatures killed crops on the vine and
wildfire smoke blanketed the country --- people are experiencing what
experts have warned about for decades: [climate change is affecting us
where we live, and undermining our ability to live where and how we have
chosen.]{.underline}

Many describe climate change as a national security threat. In a 2021
journal article, I outlined [five climate-related threats]{.underline}
to Canada: human insecurity, economic threats, [Arctic
threats,]{.underline} humanitarian crises and increased domestic
conflict. Climate security scholar Simon Dalby recently argued in this
space that "Canadian national security needs an update for climate." We
are part of a CIGI project titled and aimed at "Reimagining a Canadian
National Security Strategy for the Twenty-First Century" that builds on
previous calls noting how [the climate emergency threatens public
safety, vulnerable peoples and the Arctic]{.underline} --- including
those from Inuk leader Mary Simon, Canada's new Governor-General.
Globally, US Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, the UN
Secretary-General, and many leaders and institutions acknowledge, in
ever more dire terms, that [climate change is the foremost security
issue of our time, and threatens a century of progress in the
improvement of human well-being and expansion of human
rights.]{.underline}

Yet [despite the danger to lives]{.underline} and livelihoods[, climate
change isn't treated as a security issue]{.underline}. Canada's two most
recent defence strategies barely mention it, and [climate-related
threats are inadequately addressed by governments at all
levels.]{.underline} This shortfall in climate planning and preparedness
increases the risk of simultaneous and compounding climate-related
crises. As we face more and more severe climate disruption, these
inadequacies will fuel acute and chronic insecurity for Canadians in
much the same way bad governance combines with external events to
produce humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world. Climate change
threatens the security of people from coast to coast to coast; defending
ourselves from the changes already here and those to come is a more
Herculean task than any we have previously faced.

Calling Climate Change a Security Threat

What does it mean to call climate change a security threat? What
difference does it make? In the academic study of security, as author
Michael Sheehan explains in his 2005 book, [securitizing an issue means
"to challenge society to promote it higher in its scales of values and
to commit greater resources to solving the related
problems]{.underline}." In this account, [security issues are those that
endanger something of collective social value and that we choose to
prioritize defending against.]{.underline} On the one hand, [when
something is accepted by the general public as a threat to their
security, governments may enact measures that would not normally be
permitted]{.underline}. On the other hand, practices that enable
whatever is defined as threatening become forbidden or taboo.
[Securitization means prioritizing public resources and state
capacity]{.underline}, and determining which actions must be taken and
which may not[, for survival to be maximized.]{.underline} Consider
[threats associated with such world-altering events as World War II, the
Cold War and the September 11 terrorist attacks]{.underline}. In each
case, once a threat was accepted --- whether fascism, authoritarian
socialism or terrorism --- governments transformed the focus and
intensity of their efforts to combat it, while practices they previously
engaged in --- such as collaborating with the Nazis, cooperating with
the Soviet Union and financing terrorist entities --- had to cease.
Author Seth Klein makes precisely such comparisons in his recent book on
"mobilizing Canada for the climate emergency."
