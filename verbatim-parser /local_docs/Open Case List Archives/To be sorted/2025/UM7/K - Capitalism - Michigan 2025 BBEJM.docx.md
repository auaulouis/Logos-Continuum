[3. Are we in a **global polycrisis**?]{.underline}

We argue here that [the world is currently experiencing a **global
polycrisis**]{.underline} and that [this situation is
**worsening**]{.underline}. [Constituent crises include]{.underline} the
[lingering **health**]{.underline}, **[social]{.underline}**, [and
**economic effects** of]{.underline} the [Covid]{.underline}-19
pandemic; **[stagflation]{.underline}** (a persistent combination of
[inflation and low growth]{.underline}); [**volatility** in]{.underline}
global [food and energy markets]{.underline}; **[geopolitical
conflict]{.underline}**, especially [between **assertive** authoritarian
regimes]{.underline} (including China and Russia) [and the democratic
West]{.underline}, which is [leading to]{.underline} a partial
[decoupling of American and Chinese economies]{.underline}; [**political
instability** and **civil unrest** in countries both rich and
poor]{.underline} arising from economic insecurity, **[ideological
extremism]{.underline}**, **[political polarization]{.underline}**, [and
**declining institutional legitimacy**]{.underline}; and
[increasingly]{.underline} frequent and [**devastating weather** events
generated by climate heating]{.underline}. These crises are
**[destroying]{.underline}** livelihoods and lives around the globe and
are undoubtedly diminishing [humanity\'s prospects]{.underline}.
Moreover, [they are certainly **interconnected**]{.underline}, although
exactly how remains unclear.

This is not humanity\'s first polycrisis. We experienced at least two
additional instances in the last half century, though some may argue
they were not truly global. The oil shocks of the 1970s arose from
conflicts in the Middle East and generated severe international energy
shortages that contributed to, and interacted with, stagflation in the
world economy (Progressive International, 2023). The 2008--09 global
financial crisis intersected with oil supply constraints and long-term
stresses in food production to produce cascading bankruptcies, food
price hikes, and political unrest worldwide (Biggs et al., Reference
Biggs, Biggs, Dakos, Scholes and Schoon2011; Homer-Dixon et al.,
Reference Homer-Dixon, Walker, Biggs, Crépin, Folke, Lambin, Peterson,
Rockström, Scheffer, Steffen and Troell2015).Footnotev

While the [present polycrisis features some of the **same** constituent
crises]{.underline} -- [including **energy** and **food shocks**,
**stagflation**, and **financial instability**]{.underline} -- [it is
**unprecedented** in crucial ways]{.underline} (Homer-Dixon, Reference
Homer-Dixon2023; Lähde, Reference Lähde2023). First, the [world is **far
more interconnected**]{.underline} now than it was during the OPEC oil
shocks. Between 1980 and 2020, [air freight increased
**sixfold**]{.underline} to 180 billion-ton-kilometers per year, the
number of air passengers nearly tripled to 1.8 billion annually, and
internet usage increased from virtually 0 to 60% of the world\'s
population. Meanwhile, the [total value of]{.underline} world
[merchandise]{.underline} trade [increased **twelve-fold**]{.underline}
between 1980 and 2022 to nearly 25 trillion US dollars annually (at
current prices), and container port traffic has more than tripled since
2000 to almost 800 million 20-foot-equivalent-units in 2020.Footnotevi

The ['conduits' of]{.underline} this [extreme
**connectivity**]{.underline} -- aircraft, container carriers,
fiber-optic cables, and the like -- now [carry immense]{.underline}
circum-planetary [**flows** of]{.underline} the ['vectors' of
matter]{.underline}, energy, biota, and information (Box 1). The
conduits also create and [sustain multi-continental **markets** and
**globalized corporations**]{.underline} that in turn encourage
[increasing]{.underline} standardization and [**homogenization** among
system elements]{.underline}, from financial instruments to germ plasm
for agricultural goods to computer operating systems and social media
platforms. [This homogenization]{.underline} then [enables]{.underline}
even **[denser interconnection]{.underline}**, [in a powerful **positive
feedback**]{.underline}.

Unfortunately, [complex systems that feature both **high connectivity**
and]{.underline} high homogeneity among system elements [can be
especially prone to **rapid**, **discontinuous change**]{.underline}
(Scheffer et al., Reference Scheffer, Carpenter, Lenton, Bascompte,
Brock, Dakos, van de Koppel, van de Leemput, Levin, van Nes, Pascual and
Vandermeer2012), much as closely planted agricultural monocrops are
susceptible to devastation by pathogens. By striving to maximize
efficiency and open access to markets while stripping away social and
environmental safeguards, [**neoliberal arrangements** have exacerbated
both **homogenization** and **hyper-connectivity** in the global
economy]{.underline}, [generating **recurrent crises** and worsening
**stresses** both in the economy]{.underline} (for instance, by
increasing inequality) and in other systems (for instance, by [damaging
the **ecosphere**]{.underline}).

Even in the absence of high homogenization, [gradual shifts
in]{.underline} exogenous [conditions can **erode** a highly connected
system\'s resilience until its **stabilizing feedbacks** are
**overwhelmed**]{.underline}, and it flips to a different
[equilibrium]{.underline} (Scheffer, Reference Scheffer2009). And
[systems that may be resilient]{.underline} on their own [can become
more **vulnerable** to such flips when they become **tightly connected**
to other systems]{.underline} (Buldyrev et al., Reference Buldyrev,
Parshani, Paul, Stanley and Havlin2010; Gao et al., Reference Gao, Liu,
Li and Havlin2015); unexpected vulnerabilities can arise when system
elements not designed to work together are inadvertently connected
(Perrow, Reference Perrow1999).

In sum, the [interlinked architecture]{.underline} of our global systems
[is at the **heart** of the **current polycrisis**,]{.underline} because
[it **worsens risks** as diverse as **financial turmoil**]{.underline},
**[pandemics]{.underline}**, **[economic inequality]{.underline}**, [and
**ideological extremism**]{.underline} (Centeno et al., Reference
Centeno, Nag, Patterson, Shaver and Windawi2015; Helbing, Reference
Helbing2013; Rodrik, Reference Rodrik2011). [These]{.underline} systemic
[risks are '**endemic to globalization**']{.underline}; [they can be
managed]{.underline} ([by **reforming** the **neoliberal economic
order**]{.underline}, for instance) but not eliminated (Goldin &
Mariathasan, Reference Goldin and Mariathasan2016, p. xiii).

The present polycrisis is also [**unprecedented** in a second
respect]{.underline}. [Human **resource consumption** and **pollution
output** are pushing Earth\'s physical and ecological systems **far**
from their **previous equilibria**]{.underline}, [**imperiling** the
stability of many other global systems **critical** to human
wellbeing]{.underline}, [from **food production** to **international
security**]{.underline}. For instance, our [emissions]{.underline} of
greenhouse gases have [created an **energy imbalance**]{.underline} at
the planet\'s surface ([more heat coming in]{.underline} from space
[than going out]{.underline}) of about 1.36 Watts per square meter
(Hansen et al., Reference Hansen, Sato, Simons, Nazarenko, Sangha,
Kharecha, Zachos, von Schuckmann, Loeb, Osman, Jin, Tselioudis, Jeong,
Lacis, Ruedy, Russell, Cao and Li2023). This extra energy -- now
[equivalent to]{.underline} nearly [**one million Hiroshima-sized**
atomic **bombs** exploded in the atmosphere **every day**]{.underline}
-- is [producing increasingly **extreme** storms]{.underline},
[floods]{.underline}, [heat waves]{.underline}, [and
droughts]{.underline}, [affecting **billions**]{.underline} of people
[and worsening **population displacement**]{.underline}, **[social
instability]{.underline}**, [and **conflict**]{.underline} (Adelphi &
PIK, 2020; Ide et al., Reference Ide, Brzoska, Donges and
Schleussner2020; Schleussner et al., Reference Schleussner, Donges,
Donner and Schellnhuber2016).

Together, [hyper-connectivity and]{.underline} the
[destabilization]{.underline} of ecospheric systems [are **amplifying**
and **accelerating** crisis events **worldwide**]{.underline} (Figure
2). For example, since HIV first appeared four decades ago, outbreaks of
[zoonotic viral disease]{.underline} have [become increasingly
**severe** and **frequent**]{.underline}, from the SARS outbreak of 2002
to H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2015, Ebola again
in 2018, Covid-19 in 2019, and most recently mpox and Marburg (Araf et
al., Reference Araf, Maliha, Zhai and Zheng2023; CFR, 2023; Smith et
al., Reference Smith, Goldberg, Rosenthal, Carlson, Chen, Chen and
Ramachandran2014). Meanwhile, climate heating is also accelerating:
between 1970 and 2010, Earth\'s [tropospheric **temperature
increased**]{.underline} about 0.18 °C per decade; between 2010 and
2040, [**warming** is predicted to **increase**]{.underline} to 0.27 °C
per decade, a rise in rate of 50% (Hansen et al., Reference Hansen,
Sato, Simons, Nazarenko, Sangha, Kharecha, Zachos, von Schuckmann, Loeb,
Osman, Jin, Tselioudis, Jeong, Lacis, Ruedy, Russell, Cao and Li2023, p.
21). And because this [warming makes zoonotic **disease outbreaks** more
**likely**]{.underline}, two seemingly discrete [crises]{.underline} --
pandemics and calamitous weather -- [are becoming **increasingly
entwined**]{.underline} (Carlson et al., Reference Carlson, Albery,
Merow, Trisos, Zipfel, Eskew and Bansal2022).

\[\[FIGURE TWO OMITTED\]\]

But [global crises]{.underline} are [not just amplifying and
accelerating]{.underline}, [they also appear to be
**synchronizing**]{.underline}. 'We\'re seeing [what occurs when
**everything** happens everywhere **all at once**',]{.underline} says
International Relations theorist Stephen Walt (Reference Walt2022).
[Complex and]{.underline} largely [unrecognized causal
links]{.underline} among the world\'s economic, social, and ecological
systems seem to be [causing many risks to go **critical** at the **same
time** or in quick succession]{.underline} (Figure 3). Indeed, '[the
failure to take into account **feedbacks**]{.underline} across systems'
[is a **crucial emerging risk** itself]{.underline} (Future Earth, 2020,
p. 6).

\[\[FIGURE THREE OMITTED\]\]

While scientific knowledge of individual systemic risks like climate
change and zoonotic viral disease is often deep, our [grasp of causal
mechanisms]{.underline} linking these risks and the crises they generate
[remains **shallow**]{.underline} (ISC et al., 2022, p. 8). For
instance, the World Economic Forum\'s annual Global Risk Report
identifies apparent links among risks but does not examine amplifying
feedbacks in detail. Below, therefore, we offer an analytical framework
to help advance our understanding of the causal mechanisms driving the
present polycrisis.

Recently, the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} began to be [[treated as
a]{.mark} "**[geopolitical hotspot]{.mark}**" [and]{.mark} as a
"**[resource frontier]{.mark}**."]{.underline} The region's
international (i.e., interstate) dynamics has been drawing the attention
of scholars and [[policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark} seeking to make
sense (and [[take advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[of]{.mark} emerging
geopolitical and economic **[phenomena]{.mark}** in the
region]{.underline}. One of the main drivers of such efforts is the
so-called Arctic resource boom -- an enhanced [knowledge]{.underline} on
the resource endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially in terms of
the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves. Since the publication
of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, such knowledge of the
region has only increased, and triggered a plethora of economic
development projects for the region -- most geared towards making the
commercial exploitation of such resources viable. Such plans, typical of
[neo-extractivist [modes of **development** and **capital
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline},1) [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark} new
instruments and technologies of [control]{.underline} over land,
territory and resources -- not only in enabling the resource
exploitation, but also in [**[displacing]{.mark}** Arctic Indigenous
[populations]{.mark}]{.underline} that inhabit spaces where
resource-based economic activity is meant to take place. This process
has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling space
and mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation
activities". 2)

[Theorizations and **[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the Arctic
resource boom or on the geopolitical tensions rising in the region are
generally [[oblivious to indigenous]{.mark} political
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}, [institutions and articulations in the
region]{.underline}. [This erasure takes the **colonial violence**
underlying the **relation** between Arctic States and Arctic indigenous
peoples **out of sight**,]{.underline} [[obscuring]{.mark} the
[**violent history** of expropriation]{.mark} underpinning]{.underline}
contemporary **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** geopolitics and economic
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Another effect of such
perspectives is the [[present]{.mark}ation of [the]{.mark} [Arctic
as]{.mark} an **"[empty]{.mark}" space**]{.underline}, [**devoid** of
people]{.underline}, social dynamics and politics other than those
developed and brought by Westphalian States.3) This position [seeks to
**[justify]{.mark} State [interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
region [for]{.underline} "properly" [**seizing** emerging economic and
strategic opportunities]{.underline} -- with little to no regard for
indigenous cultures and subsistence in the Arctic, nor to the already
sensible effects of climate change in the region.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

The present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new
wave of Arctic settler colonialism. We argue that, although projects for
resource exploitation of the Arctic are achieving unprecedented scale,
they represent a continuity of the colonial project, benefitting from
the way previous waves of colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic
spaces and the relations between Indigenous peoples and their
traditional territories. Our discussion is focused on the impacts of
colonialism over the Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit
homeland -- and the impacts of colonialism over the relation between
State, indigenous peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a
discussion of the Arctic resource boom and the strategic and development
projects emerging in the Arctic policies of littoral states and their
treatment of indigenous issues amid economic and strategic pressures to
carve out new extractive enclaves in Arctic territories. We depart from
a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to understand how
the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American populations and
the importance of resource extraction shaped contemporary Arctic spaces
-- from baleen and whale oil to the gold rush and discovery of
hydrocarbons. One important element here is to understand how this first
moment of colonialism set up the conditions for modern-day resource
development projects. The discussion, then, turns to contemporary
economic development projects in the Arctic, understanding them as
neo-extractivist enterprises -- i.e., enterprises that rely heavily on
resource development and control over space in a late capitalist
globalized economy. As such, these projects represent a geographical
expansion of extractive frontiers in a global scale, seeking new
resource reserves and to reshape space to make them commercially viable.
This represents a new wave of colonialism -- i.e., of attempts by state
and capital to enhance control over traditional indigenous territories
-- and a new wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples from their rights to their traditional lands and
livelihoods. Old colonialisms: the colonial encounter in Inuit Nunaat
'Government, as such, was introduced when the whaling fleet came to the
Beaufort Sea, when the trappers came to the Canadian Arctic, and when
the Danes came to Greenland. Behind them came the Christian
missionaries, and behind them came those who "governed" us.'4) In the
field of International Studies, analyses of Arctic geopolitics and
economic development tend to overlook the process of transformation of
the Arctic in a series of discrete territorial jurisdictions -- and the
colonial violence underpinning such process is generally absent from
historical narratives and theoretical reflections. Since mainstream
theorizations organize their gaze from the point of view of the State,
subnational and non-national, non-state political organizations are
rendered invisible. Therefore, the colonization of Inuit Nunaat -- and,
in fact, the colonization of the traditional homelands of many
indigenous peoples are excluded from theoretical efforts and reflections
developed within international relations in general. The recent spike in
interest in Arctic issues has reproduced such erasures, thinking through
narrow definitions of geopolitics and economic development, seeing such
issues so long as they represent problems and/or opportunities for
Arctic States. This framework has rendered Arctic international
relations into discussions and theorizing of Arctic interstate
relations, excluding indigenous political organizations from such
debates. An account of the colonial encounter in Arctic spaces, more
than a mere historical recapitulation of how States occupied and annexed
Inuit Nunaat into their sovereign jurisdictions, is also a necessary
step in comprehending and theorizing contemporary Arctic environmental,
geopolitical and economic issues. The colonization of Inuit Nunaat by
Westphalian States such as Canada, the US and Russia, left its mark on
several dimensions of Inuit life. Such populations were subject to a
violent process that combined attempts at cultural assimilation with the
disarticulation of their livelihoods and social organization. In her
narrative of the environmental history of the Bering Strait, Demuth
shows how the articulation of indigenous social and economic practices
with the demands of distant markets also brought about ecological
imbalances that upended life in Inuit Nunaat.5) While the colonial
encounter did not mean outright expropriation of land, the discovery of
gold and, afterwards, of oil in Arctic lands and waters radically
changed this scenario. The material aspects of gold mining and oil
extraction required new technologies for controlling space and economic
activity, expanding State and capital control over portions of Inuit
land through enclosure. Bathsheba Demuth6) and Jessica Shadian7) have
written detailed accounts of the colonial past of the Inuit peoples.
Although a people with a large history of contact with European sailors
and explorers in the Arctic, the interest that the Euro-American world
showed for products present in Inuit land was a fatal blow to Inuit
livelihoods, society and culture. Search for products like baleen, whale
oil, walrus tusks and furs articulated subsistence activities of Inuit
communities to the capitalist world market. The pressure in the US
mainland for these products led European and Inuit hunters to team up in
the hunt for whales, walruses and even the Arctic fox, nearly leading
such species to extinction. The multiple dimensions of contact between
US whalers and Inuit communities left a trail of disease, the
near-extinction of these beings rendered subsistence hunting almost
impossible -- leaving a trail of dispossession, misery and disease in
the Arctic. In her account of the environmental history of the floating
coast, Demuth describes how sustained contact between Euro-American
states/societies and the Indigenous peoples of the Arctic also
articulated their livelihoods to the global circuits of capital flows
and global processes of capital accumulation.8) Demuth's work is
precious in its description of the social and ecological impacts of
colonialism -- specially when concerned with the ever-growing need for
resources that came from the region's fauna like whale oil, baleen,
walrus' tusks, fox pelts. Up to 1852, whale, walrus and fox hunting, for
instance, were oriented towards the subsistence of Beringian
communities, with the volume of activity ebbing in consonance with the
rhythms of the lives of such beings. The contact with foreigners,
specially those from the US, was initially driven by commercial whaling
and, eventually, moved on to the hunt for walruses, substitutes for
whale meat and source of materials used in the everyday lives of
indigenous peoples, and of Arctic foxes, valued for their pelts as
fashion accessories in Euro-American societies. This articulation of
regional subsistence economies to those moved by motives of ever-growing
profits of the capitalist Euro-American societies was the main driver of
the predatory hunting of such animals and caused great turmoil in
ecological and socio-economic terms. The predatory hunting of whales and
other animals brought about a deep ecological imbalance. Demuth's
discussion rightly puts it in terms of disappearing calories, of energy
being syphoned away from Arctic waters through the commercial hunting of
Arctic animals. This process dealt a terrible blow to the subsistence of
the indigenous communities of the Arctic, materialized in the emergence
of situations of deep deprivation, with the spread of diseases and vices
(specially alcoholism) throughout Beringia. "The market" Demuth states
"had taken Beringian blubber and traded it back for empty metal pots".9)
Demuth10) and Shadian11) highlight the importance of such ecological
imbalances to the expansion of state control over Inuit communities. The
perception of the social maladies caused by predatory hunting was
deflected to the character of the indigenous communities, both in
Beringian lands, but also in the rest of Inuit Nunaat, legitimizing
policies aimed at remodelling their subjectivities. Paternalist policies
to remedy such ailments were spearheads for assimilationist policies
that sought to impede the reproduction of the Inuit culture. The
remodelling of indigenous subjectivities was one of the main goals,
pursued through Christian indoctrination and a preparation for
subsistence through work in capitalist economies. Coupled with the
social and economic crisis brought about by the disappearing calories,
it is visible a process that, deliberately or not, was bent on the
disarticulation of non-European, non-capitalist social formations, be it
through attacking their material conditions of livelihood or their
cultural practices. These attempts to subsuming indigenous
subjectivities and cultural practices under the demands of global
capitalism, was another important aspect of State policies that sought
not only to extract products from the Arctic, but also to turn the human
element of the region into labour, making them "useful" for the
activities carried on by white settlers in these regions. While
different colonialisms developed across Inuit Nunaat, it is important to
note how, albeit presenting different rationalities across time and
space, they developed the same solution -- enclosure and border-making
-- to the question of how to regulate relations between settler
populations and Inuit peoples. According to Demuth,12) the United States
and the Russian Empire had very similar concerns about the contact
between Arctic indigenous populations and Euro-American settlers
attracted to the region. The commerce of whale-related products and even
of Inuit labour in exchange for firearms, liquor and tobacco was seen as
deleterious for the civilizing projects such empires purported to
represent -- as well as a direct threat to the control over Arctic
spaces in the case of firearms. Enclosures and border making, in this
first moment, served to contain market activity and direct the flow of
goods and the energies of the populations to the objectives of the
sovereign powers that sought to claim portions of Inuit Nunaat as part
of their territories. With the interest in products of animal origin
like whale oil, walrus tusks and fox pelts waned, and the price of such
commodities crashed during the late nineteenth century, this did not
translate into an abandonment of settler colonialism. The colonial
project got a new élan with the discovery of gold in some parts of Inuit
Nunaat. As a commodity, gold had an important role not only as a tool
for economic development, but also played an important role in the
global economy due to the widespread adoption of the gold standard. The
discovery of gold and, later, of oil, constitute the main turn in Arctic
colonialisms. While harvesting or trading baleen with the peoples of the
Arctic offered little room to direct control over space, resources
embedded in the soil, such as gold and oil, demand that territoriality
and property are made clear on site. Moreover, the exploitation of such
resources is, from the standpoint of capital and State, dynamic in the
sense that their exploitation spurs a series of associated economic
activities, seen as a possible remedy for the poverty and deprivation
faced by Arctic communities as well as providing Euro-American settlers
with the products and labour needed to make such activities viable and
profitable.The Arctic resource boom and new Arctic colonialisms In the
turn of the twentieth century, news of the presence of gold in Alaska
and in Chukokta attracted the attention of State, capital and
individuals seeking to make fortune through mining. Demuth stresses how
the commercial extraction of minerals demanded, on the settler side,
enclosure and definition of property rights over land and
underground.13) In different parts of Inuit Nunaat, different
arrangements were made in attempt to define and reinforce borders as
well as seizing the economic opportunity brought about by the knowledge
of gold in the Arctic. In the Russian Empire, for example, gold mining
was seen as an imperial concession rather than a private enterprise,
undertook to secure the imperial bullion reserves. In the U.S, on the
other hand, while gold mining was seen as a matter of private
enterprise, it involved State intervention in defining property rights,
settling disputes and defining which citizens were entitled to the
exploitation of gold mining. Both solutions to the problem of enclosure
and property over land were instrumental in extending the reach of the
State inland. The sea was (at that moment) not liable to
territorialization and the hunting activities over the shore and sea-ice
did not entail long-term settlement opportunities, the need to settle
ownership claims and to stimulate mining activity. The discovery of
gold, and the initial ease with which it could be mined, attracted large
contingents of foreigners to Alaska and crystallized ethnic/racial
divisions within Inuit Nunaat. White foreigners sought fortune on gold
mining, while the Iñupiaq of the region were not only physically
segregated, but also relegated to providing subsistence goods and
services (clothing, reindeer meat, transport) that supported the mining
activity. In Russia, on the other hand, the Empire and then the
Bolsheviks sought to control the flow of gold and resettling populations
from other parts of Russia in the region, seeking to turn gold into the
gravitational centre of Chukokta's economy. For the populations of Inuit
Nunaat, these different solutions meant the same -- enclosure that
sought to separate these peoples from their traditional lands and their
livelihoods, which were redirected by the efforts of States to better
serve settler dominated economic activities. The introduction of
coal-powered dredges and the structuration of corporate mining over the
beginning of the twentieth century14) were responsible for accelerating
these trends. Finally, the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in
the late 1970's closes the gap between what we dubbed the "old"
colonialisms and the "new" ones. In the words of Eben Hopson, one of the
founders of the Inuit Circumpolar Council: Our people, who survived the
fur trade, international whaling, and the gold rush, began being
threatened by the world's oil shortage. The oil discovery at Prudhoe Bay
meant that the European immigrants to America had become rich, highly
industrialised people, and had finally begun to covet our Arctic
land.15) Oil and gas extraction, much like gold mining, are activities
that demand great control over space, not only in the regions where the
extraction occurs, but also in the constitution and maintenance of
logistic corridors. Allowing for movement to and from the producing
regions, connecting them to global markets is fundamental in such
economic activities, which makes land an important asset for State and
capitalist agents involved. Moreover, and, like gold, oil and gas are
deeply enmeshed in global geopolitics, meaning that the development of
hydrocarbon reserves is important for States to achieving their
political and strategic objectives in the global scenario. The mentioned
perception of the coveting of Inuit land, together with the need to
preserve Inuit culture also led to the establishment of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, a pan-Arctic Inuit caucus where Inuit rights and
claims were collectively discussed, leading to the founding of the Inuit
Circumpolar Council. Shadian's research details how the 'politics of
oil' articulated Inuit local politics in Canada, Greenland and the U.S
with global issue. The discovery of oil in regions like northern Alaska
and the Arctic in general has been one of the main drivers of
geopolitical interest in the region. There were, however, gaps in
Euro-American awareness about the presence of hydrocarbon reserves in
the region -- a trend reversed by the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal
of 2008. With the publication of the first comprehensive study by the
United States Geological Survey on the resource endowment of the Arctic,
interest in the economic development of the region spiked. It is
estimated that 30% of the world's undiscovered gas reserves and 13% of
the undiscovered oil reserves are in the Arctic.16) The surge in
interest reflects a global trend: the emergence of neo-extractivist
capital accumulation,17) based on increasing pressure over natural goods
and resources and one in which the global extractive frontiers expand,
exerting additional pressures over lands and territories where resource
reserves can be found. The expansion of the global extractive frontier
is directly related to pressure over the traditional lands of Indigenous
peoples, and in tandem with the growing struggle for the recognition of
indigenous rights to self-government. The growing demand for
hydrocarbons and mineral resources potentially can impact all of Inuit
Nunaat, putting the security and economic development of Arctic States
in a collision route with indigenous rights and demands in the region.
DuPlessis also points to how the expansion of the global extractive
frontier is affecting the mobilities and spatialities of the indigenous
peoples of the Arctic.18) Resource development activities and the
discourses that support them are examples of "striation activities",19)
activities through which the modern biopolitical state imposes its
striated spatiality over the smooth spatiality of the nomadic Sámi
people. Transport infrastructure development plays a large role in this
process, since it is one of the ways through which the state occupies a
space and exercise control over it by organising it in points,20) thus
striating it and enabling the government of movement and other
spatialities in the region. Striation activities in the Arctic rely
heavily on the planning and construction of physical infrastructure and
logistic corridors that create the necessary lines connecting strategic
points, not only for the direct objective of enabling economic activity
via circulation but also to seize the strategic advantages given by such
points and such connections.

Old colonialisms and the new: legacies, [continuities and]{.underline}
further [issues]{.underline}

While [contemporary projects of]{.underline} economic [**[development in
the Arctic]{.mark}** have reached **new scales**]{.underline} and
exploit new resource frontiers, they are [closely related
to]{.underline} the continuity of 'old' [Arctic
**colonialisms**]{.underline}. In their development, the
[[perpetuat]{.mark}ion of the]{.underline} settler-colonial [[logic of
**capitalist economic development**]{.underline}]{.mark} coupled with
reasons of the Euro-American polities that [[claim]{.mark} the [Arctic
as]{.mark} part of **[their territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[constitute]{.mark} the basis of **'[Arctic
geopolitics]{.mark}'**]{.underline}. Another new element is the growing
importance of the Arctic as a geopolitical hotspot in world politics.
While economic reasons are an important driver for territorial
reorganizations in the Arctic, [**national security** and **defence
issues**]{.underline} also play an important part in such processes. The
[reorganization of **[military]{.mark} structures** and the redefinition
of **military strategies** and objectives in the Arctic]{.underline} --
seen in Russia, in the US and Canada, [[encompassing]{.mark} **all** of
the **[Inuit]{.mark} homeland**]{.underline} -- [[points to]{.mark} a
tendency of **[increased control]{.mark}** being exercised [over]{.mark}
**hyperborean [spaces]{.mark}** by States]{.underline}.

The [[emergence of]{.underline}]{.mark} neo-extractivist **[[capitalist
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**21) [might [be the **defining
feature**]{.mark} of emerging Arctic colonialisms]{.underline}.
Neo-extractivist [capital accumulation is]{.underline} characterized by
pressure over natural resources and the [[demand for **greater
capitalist control over space**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [reinforcing a
**relationship** between **humanity** and **nature**]{.underline} based
on the economic value of land and natural resources. While colonial
projects attempt to recast themselves as necessary in the face of
external threats or as the reasonable way of seizing the Arctic resource
boom, their objectives are similar to those of old colonialisms: subsume
indigenous territories and subjectivities under the logic of capitalist
accumulation and extending State (and capital) control over the
populations that inhabit them. It is possible to note that, if their
scale and methods are somehow different from eighteenth and nineteenth
century colonialisms, they still represent a continuity of the colonial
project. Moreover, the long history of the nefarious impacts of
colonialism and the deep disarticulation it brought to the Inuit peoples
allowed the erasure of indigenous presences and the emergence of 'empty
Arctic' narratives -- used by both neo-extractivist capitalism and the
national-territorial State in legitimizing the rationale behind such
projects.

Another important aspect of the colonial project in Inuit Nunaat (and,
in fact, in many other colonized regions), brilliantly explored in
Demuth's work, is the remodelling of the relation between humanity and
nature in colonized spaces. Be it with land, the sea, sea ice or
animals, capitalism as a mode of production, and neo-extractivism as a
path of economic development under such system, demand the construction
of an instrumental relation to these non-human elements of the
environment. This understanding entails a [[**relation** between human
and non-human]{.underline}]{.mark} nature developed under the mediation
of value and valorisation -- the [main [goal]{.mark}s [of **capital
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic activity [under
capitalist relations of production]{.underline}. This
[**[forecloses]{.mark}** a range of different **[social
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}, seen as something to be moulded under
the logic and temporality of (capitalist) economic practices. While
Demuth discusses how Beringian cultures in general did not have stark
distinctions between humanity and non-humanity, Shadian, on the other
hand, highlights how such relations, among the Inuit are expressed
through the concept of inua. Rather than seeing man as a separate of and
dominating nature, Inuit populations understood themselves not only as
part of nature, but also as being stewards of the non-human nature and
of their homelands and home-environments.

#### The alternative is [democratic socialism]{.underline} that rejects the [inevitability]{.underline} of markets.

https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/democratic-planning-for-degrowth/\]

We live in truly historic times. According to the recent UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report, [there is a
"**rapidly closing** window of opportunity" to secure a livable and
**sustainable future** for all]{.underline}. [To
**prevent**]{.underline} a catastrophic "hothouse Earth" scenario of
**[extreme warming]{.underline}** and sea-level rise, "rapid and
[far-reaching **[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}s across all sectors
and systems [are **[necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}." There is
[**mounting** evidence that]{.underline}, for rich countries, [to
achieve the **necessary**]{.underline} much faster mitigation pathways
[requires **abandoning** aggregate economic **growth**]{.underline}.

Despite all efforts at decarbonization in high-income countries, which
are often trumpeted as showing that GDP can be decoupled from emissions,
the [**scale** and **speed** of emission reductions is **nowhere** near
what would be **necessary**]{.underline}. Indeed, scientific evidence
from recent years shows that if the countries of the Global North
continue to pursue "[**[green growth]{.mark}**," it is extremely
**[unlikely]{.mark}** that **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as emissions will be
**reduced**]{.underline} at the rate and scale [needed [to
**avoid**]{.mark} climate [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let us take
Europe as an example: While the shift to lower-carbon energy between
1990 and 2020 has enabled a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 34
percent (not accounting for trade), these reductions of less than 1
percent per year on average are far from what is needed to curb climate
breakdown, which are estimated to be around 11 percent reductions per
year for Germany, or 6 percent for the European Union, according to the
German Advisory Council on the Environment. Other analysis points to the
need for even steeper emission reductions.1

In fact, an increasingly [robust body of **scientific** literature shows
that **green** growth cannot be **sustainable**]{.underline}---but also,
that a [**different** form of organizing society is
**possible**]{.underline}.2 To achieve sustainability, so-called
developed [countries [need to **abandon**]{.mark} the objective of GDP
[growth and **scale down**]{.mark} less necessary and destructive forms
of **[production]{.mark}** to reduce energy and material
use]{.underline}. [We [need a **planned**]{.mark} and selective
[**contraction** of economic activity]{.mark}]{.underline} aimed at
increasing well-being and equality.3 Or, as recently argued in this
journal, [we need "**[ecosocialist degrowth]{.mark}**]{.underline}."4
Degrowth is [**[founded on]{.mark}** and justified by [a **solid
critique** of **market instruments**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
optimistic [[reliance on **price**]{.mark} **mechanisms** [and
**private-sector**]{.mark} solutions]{.underline}, which are
[**central** to so-called "green economy" approaches]{.underline}.
Indeed, the lack of social-ecological planning and the reliance on
socially unjust and often [[**ineffective** market]{.mark} instruments
is precisely what has [**led** us into]{.mark} this
**[mess]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the first place.

[**[Degrowth]{.mark}** formulates [an **alternative** to]{.mark} the
[capitalist **market**]{.mark}]{.underline} that seeks to [**escape**
the capitalist **growth imperative**]{.underline}, which continuously
impedes mitigation efforts by driving rising energy demand.5
[**Degrowth** is built around a fundamental [**democratization**
of]{.mark} the [economy and]{.mark} collective
"**[self-limitation]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (per André Gorz), or the
setting of collectively defined societal boundaries and entitlements
that define the conditions for a good life for all.6 All of [this is
going to **require** democratic planning]{.underline}. In fact,
collective self-limitation can be understood as the strongest expression
of democratic, societal autonomy, manifested in social liberation from
the pervasive "heteronomous" logic of accumulation. It is [the [drive to
**accumulation**]{.mark} that compels **capitalist** societies to pursue
continuous **expansion** and that [**prevents** adherence to]{.mark}
democratically determined [**collective** rules]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}** is an expression of societal freedom
or autonomy, in the sense of an act of collective self-government, thus
**[[resisting]{.underline}]{.mark}** "the functional regulation of
conduct according to given principles, such as [the so-called [law of
the **market**]{.mark} or the [**mantra** of]{.mark} austerity and
**[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}."7

So, how might planning beyond growth look? [**[Degrowth]{.mark}** does
not have to **reinvent** the wheel]{.underline}. [It can [build on
**ongoing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, productive debates about [ecological
**[planning]{.mark}**, participatory economies, and **economic**
democracy]{.underline}. These topics have been extensively studied in
the fields of geography, environmental management, and industrial
engineering, and have been a key focus in economic and socialist
literature. [Currently, [there is a **resurgence**]{.mark} of interest
[in]{.mark} economic **[planning]{.mark}** as a [**postcapitalist**
project]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 Most of these planning discussions, as
well as related debates on digitalization platform communism, have
largely neglected ecological questions, the issue of growth or degrowth,
and limits in general.9 Fortunately, there are some notable exceptions
in the ecosocialist tradition, as well as recent efforts to revive
democratic socialist planning in response to present ecological
crises.10

[**Ecological** planning for **degrowth**]{.underline} can be thought of
as [the **democratic** deliberation of both **ecological** limits and
**social** needs]{.underline}, or of planning what in heterodox economic
thought has become known as "'the donut.'" This means that
[society]{.underline}---[based on **scientific** evidence]{.underline}
and public debate---[**democratically** decides how to **organize** the
process of social **provisioning** and how to avoid **transgressing**
planetary boundaries]{.underline}. After all, while both planetary
boundaries and social needs are often understood as objective scientific
concepts, [they can **only** become politically **effective** if they
result from **societal** decision-making processes]{.underline}.11

Ecological planning beyond growth can take various forms. Ultimately, it
could [[**converge** around]{.mark} multilevel]{.underline}, fractally
integrated, [**[non-market]{.mark}**-mediated]{.underline} and
subsidiary planning **[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
coordinate the local with society-wide and global institutions, as we
have argued in a recent paper.12 But **[degrowth]{.underline}** is not
only [a proposal for a full-fledged **postcapitalist**
economy]{.underline}, but centrally a proposal for transformation, not
only conceptualizing the goal, but also the path from where we are
today. Degrowth thus discusses how to [**transform** existing
institutions through **radical** reforms]{.underline} that create growth
independencies and improve sustainability and justice. Its radical
policy proposals can be interpreted as [using **planning** tools for a
social-ecological **transformation**]{.underline} of industrial
societies that start within markets, through the state, and on local or
national levels, but that [continuously **push back** against
competitive **market** forces]{.underline} and hierarchical states, and
will eventually have to transform global institutions.

Degrowth policies, we argue, offer a variety of key entry points for
ecological planning beyond growth, as they conceptualize radical change
starting from existing institutions. This approach is similar to what
Gorz has called "non-reformist reforms," or Rosa Luxemburg's
"revolutionary Realpolitik." We highlight five sets of such radical
degrowth policy areas that could form an integral part of ecosocial
planning, transitioning to a postgrowth economy beyond capitalism.

\(1\) Selective flourishing and [**[downscaling]{.mark}** of
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}: The changes necessary to achieve a
just, low-carbon transition are far-reaching and complex. The most
obvious case in point, from a degrowth perspective, is the question of
expansion and contraction. A degrowth transformation means that
"creative destruction" (per Joseph Schumpeter) and related
expansion---or, to put it differently, the [**[phasing out]{.mark}** and
simultaneous **expansion** of different **[sectors]{.mark}**,
technologies, **[resource-uses]{.mark}**, or **economic**
activities]{.underline}---would [**[no longer]{.mark}** be [left
to]{.mark} the **[market]{.mark}**, **competition**, and
**prices**]{.underline}. Most importantly, rapid mitigation demands
active reduction and phasing out of fossil fuel production and use based
on a binding and scientifically determined schedule that takes remaining
carbon budgets into account.

Yet [it is **not** just **fossil fuels**]{.underline} that must be dealt
with---fast mitigation in rich countries also [requires **phasing out**
other globalized, **profit**-oriented, **unsustainable** industrial
economic **sectors**]{.underline} that do not serve the common good,
while at the same time improving and expanding activities that ensure
human flourishing within ecological limits, such as all aspects of care,
renewable energy sources, regenerative agriculture, low-carbon public
transport, and so on. Economic coordination and [planning are
**central** to achieve this]{.underline}. Social activity that does not
advance human well-being, such as "bullshit" and "batshit" jobs, the
arms industry and the military, advertising, lobbying, planned
obsolescence, fast fashion, border security, and large parts of the
financial industry, will have to be scaled down. The same goes for any
economic activity that cannot be restructured socioecologically, such as
a large part of motorized individual transport (above all in cities),
air transport, and globalized trade, as well as industrial agriculture
and industrial animal farming. To ensure the affected workers (and
communities) are at the center of this process, just transitions should
involve processes of conversion of firms and industries, adequate
retraining of workers, and early retirement schemes. Besides
sector-specific arrangements, [**degrowth** strives for a more **just
distribution** of work]{.underline} at the societal level, including
both commodified and uncommodified work. This will have to involve
decided processes that consider the multiple existing inequities along
the lines of gender, race and class, among others.13

## Framework

### Framework\-\--Epistemology\-\--2NC

#### Debates about [neoliberalism]{.underline} foster [activism]{.underline} and [social change]{.underline}.

"A Democratic Vision for Public Schools (SSIR)." Ssir.org, 2024,
ssir.org/articles/entry/public-education-after-neoliberalism#.\]//neev

Responding to these trends, the education sector has [pulled
back]{.underline} on some [aspects of neoliberal reform]{.underline}
while holding fast to others. Topics such as [[equity, social]{.mark}
and emotional [learning]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[career
pathways]{.underline}]{.mark} have supplanted standards and
accountability at the **[[center of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Education philanthropy, once a
unified ally of neoliberal policies, has fragmented,
[[aid]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the [[diffusion of new
ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} but also scattering funder influence across
disparate strategies. [[With regard to policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
2015 Every Student Succeeds Act moderated NCLB's focus on
accountability, while both Republicans (declining support for national
standards) and Democrats (declining support for charter schools) have
retreated from consensus neoliberal views.

Neoliberalism has likewise receded in the [political
economy]{.underline}. In fact, the first major crack in NCLB's armor
came not from education but from the Tea Party movement's fervent
opposition to the [Common Core State Standards]{.underline} in the early
2010s.11 Whereas rank-and-file conservatives had largely supported (or
been indifferent to) the neoliberal trajectory of education reform until
that point, the Tea Party [marked a surge of **populism** and
**ethnonationalism**]{.underline} that would engulf the political right.
Economic populism has likewise ascended on the left---best represented
by US Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns---and
recent years have brought together strange cross-partisan bedfellows on
issues of trade, labor, and [industrial policy]{.underline}.

The **[[neoliberal paradigm]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[has
**cracked**]{.underline}]{.mark}---not crumbled. But this current
transition has brought much graver threats to American democracy. The
confluence of economic pain, demographic change, and new media has
proved fertile ground for authoritarian leaders to champion supersized
individualism and resistance to government as a return to an idealized
past. These trends accelerated during COVID-19, as concepts from
scientific denial to medical freedom moved to the conservative
mainstream, unified by the idea that individual rights should surpass
all else. Of course, individualism, as Alexis de Tocqueville famously
observed, is the quintessential American ideal, but it serves democracy
only when coupled with a responsibility to the common good---a lesson
lost in recent years.12

In education, what started in 2020 as declarations of parental rights
against school closures, masks, and vaccines spread quickly to the
firestorm over critical race theory.13 Individual parental rights have
since become [pretexts for banning books]{.underline}, [discriminating
against LGBTQ+ students]{.underline}, and [whitewashing curricula of any
mention of racism]{.underline} or similar so-called divisive subjects
that provide comprehensive accounts of US history. Statewide candidates
have won office wearing intolerance as a badge of honor, while
down-ballot races like school boards have become subject to organized
national efforts to push an antiequity agenda. Lest this be seen as a
phenomenon solely of red states, research has shown a chilling effect on
student learning nationwide: Two-thirds of [[teachers
report]{.underline}]{.mark} that they have
**[[limited]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [[classroom discussion of
political]{.underline}]{.mark} or social [[issues]{.underline}]{.mark}
[for fear of punishment or public harassment]{.underline}.

Of course, [[once you **discredit** a **public institution**, you
can **dismantle it**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As distrust for education has
risen on the ethnopopulist right, the idea of helping parents to leave
that system, left over from the school-choice days of neoliberalism, has
become a ready solution. This precedent has led to an increase in
efforts to defund public schools outright, plus a rise in voucher
bills across state legislatures. And while [ethnopopulists and
neoliberals diverge ideologically]{.underline}, this fusion on a
political-wedge issue like school choice is exactly what we would expect
as one socioeconomic paradigm makes an uneasy transition to the next.

In sum, the [[neoliberal education]{.underline}]{.mark} reform
era---first by redefining education's purpose toward individual returns,
and second by falling short on grand promises of
improvement---[[created]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**long-term conditions**
for people to leave]{.underline}]{.mark} public
[[schools]{.underline}]{.mark} and **[label them as
failing]{.underline}**. As a result, simply repeating the school reforms
of past decades, but doing them better, appears unlikely to succeed. The
changes that we need can flow only from a bolder, broader purpose for
public schools in our changing multiracial democracy.

Renewing Education's Purpose

While the successor to neoliberalism remains uncertain, we see a moment
of opportunity to seed a renewed vision for the purpose of public
education. This frame should support a more vibrant democracy, as well
as broad sociocultural shifts: A society bound by common purpose, not
just individual aims. An economy that values cooperation as much as
competition, and human thriving alongside growth. A politics that
inspires pluralism over polarization. And a citizenry that can
participate fully in these arenas, no matter one's starting point. This
vision should not exclude the lessons from neoliberalism and prior
iterations of the capitalist model. Innovation, economic dynamism, fair
footing in the marketplace---all these and more are aspirations worth
striving for.

A **[[renewed purpose for education]{.underline}]{.mark}** flows from
these democratic ideals while responding to larger shifts in society. We
suggest two fundamental goals for what this renewed democratic purpose
for education should be:

[[Prepare young people to thrive]{.underline}]{.mark} in a diverse,
changing democracy. \| It's difficult to imagine long-term, durable
improvements to civic life unless today's young people are prepared to
think critically, sort facts from falsehoods, grapple with ethical
questions, and work together across lines of difference. This task means
reversing a decades-long trend in which schools have paid little
attention to the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of civics, and
returning education, in the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to
its role as the "safeguard of democracy."

Renew the public purpose of schools for our broader society. \|
[[Elevat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the **[[civic
preparation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of young
people]{.underline}]{.mark} can strengthen our communities and
democracy, yet a broader set of contextual questions includes whether
this democratic purpose can become widely **[shared among
education]{.underline}** decision makers and the public. After all,
following decades of emphasizing schools' individual economic returns,
even talking about education as having a common purpose is akin to
recalling a forgotten language. What, then, is the purpose of public
schools to our [changing and diverse democracy]{.underline}? These
questions need addressing, broad as they may be. Such an endeavor should
not just strengthen education as a public good but anticipate new
shifts, such as [artificial intelligence]{.underline}, that will [buffet
schools and their graduates]{.underline} in the years to come.

#### Debates [limited]{.underline} to the [confines]{.underline} of neoliberalism [replicate]{.underline} class attacks and [diminish]{.underline} educational benefits.

In general**,** what's happened today **[[in

ideas]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [[mobilized to]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[bolster]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[class

been **beaten back**]{.underline}. And these [neoliberal ideas have been
**used** to beat **workers back**]{.underline}. What's happening now is
that people are starting to realize the [[**limits** of **educational
reforms** along **neoliberal lines**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They [don't
like privatization]{.underline} as much as they used to. They [recognize

Abstract

The papers in this special issue on the spaces of pedagogy speak to the
failures of neoliberal thinking when applied to education. Their
[[pedagogical critique of neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} contributes
to a [considerable body of work]{.underline} focused on [**challenging**
the]{.underline} **[[driving discourses of
education]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or more accurately, school) systems.
The source of the tensions between four decades of policy-supported
educational marketization and the accompanying objections, rejections
and warnings, require careful questioning in terms of what the very
[debate reveals about education, learning, school, pedagogy]{.underline}
and so on. In this paper, these questions are asked in relation to
neoliberal thinking about indigeneity, knowledge and the individual. The
idea of what to do, how to approach things differently, draws together
these critiques of [neoliberalism in higher education]{.underline}. The
purpose of this paper is to amplify the collective critique of
neoliberalism. [Analyses and challenges to educational
relationships]{.underline} that deploy neoliberal thinking are
positioned to keep in question the nature and purpose of neoliberalism.

Introduction

The papers in this special issue on the [[spaces of
pedagogy]{.underline}]{.mark} [[speak to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[failures of neoliberal thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** when applied
to education. Their [pedagogical critique of neoliberalism]{.underline}
within a sociology, politics and philosophy of education contributes to
a **[considerable body of work]{.underline}** focused on challenging the
driving discourses of education systems. As the abiding discourse in
higher education, neoliberalism poses a challenge due to its very
'potency' -- a potency that derives from its effective employment of
social, economic, technological and political thinking (Peters et al.,
2000). The source of the tensions between four decades of
policy-supported educational marketization, and the accompanying
objections, rejections and warnings, require careful questioning in
terms of what the very debate reveals about education, learning, school,
pedagogy and so on. In this paper, these questions are asked in relation
to neoliberal thinking about indigeneity, knowledge and the individual.

The idea of what to do, how to approach things differently, [draws
together these **critiques of neoliberalism**]{.underline} in higher
education. The focus for this special issue is the
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} and shared stories of [[active
pedagogical resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}s in and through various
roles and contexts in higher education -- each of which, in different
ways, speaks to a **[[poetic response to policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The purpose of this paper, as a recognition and response, is to amplify
the collective critique of neoliberalism. The challenges to the
neoliberal drivers of educational relationships are positioned to keep
in question the nature and purpose of neoliberalism. In so doing, the
papers in this issue offer alternatives to the possibilities of
participation in higher education.

The problem of the local

I believe that the only way education can truly change for the
betterment of our kanaka maoli and minority students, and for all
students, is through Hawaiian culture based practices, what I refer to
here as Hawaiian ways of knowing, that incorporate the cultural values,
ways of knowing and ways of relating in our classrooms (Ikeda, 2018:
870).

The idea of a global and [growing **knowledge economy** in the **21st
century,**]{.underline} an idea that features strongly in 21st century
higher education rhetoric, brings to bear new tensions for communities
whose knowledge has been the object of marginalising policies through
pre-21st century European colonisation projects. The 'old' and the
'local' ways of knowing are engaged in two largely contradictory
relationships or problems. The first, and more familiar, involves an
intervention at the site of local knowledge in order to replace local
techniques of government with neoliberal techniques of government. The
second operates seemingly at odds to the first, looking to maintain
local practices and knowledge. While neither are new challenges for
communities (Ikeda, 2018; Kupferman, 2018), their continued pervasion in
all spheres of life requires ongoing and sustained resistance.

The first tension is evidence of the essence of neoliberalism as
distinct from liberalism and is a critical paradox in neoliberal
thinking in relation to the role of centralised governance and education
policy. The [[very purpose of education]{.underline}]{.mark}, as a
global phenomenon, is subjected to a unifying discourse of the
'learning' society (Biesta, 2016). In the learning society, education
and school are spoken of as if the same thing (Kupferman,
2018). Kupferman's (2018) concern with this conflation is a [[neoliberal
reiteration of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[colonial
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}, layering further impediments to the
understanding of knowledge as local, and to the legitimisation of the
project of colonization through the erasure of the [history of school as
colonizing]{.underline} (Kupferman, 2018). Neoliberal thinking tends
'towards a form of political sovereignty which would be a government of
all and of each, and whose concerns would be at once to "totalise" and
to "individualise"' (Gordon, 1991: 33). Hence, there is [[no rationale
for maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark} any roots of local knowledge within
the neoliberal '**[[hegemonic discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
western nation states' (Olssen and Peters, 2005: 314). And this despite
the observed [localised manifestations of neoliberal
thinking]{.underline} and practice evident in the development of nation
state economic and public policy since the formation of the Mont Pélerin
Society in 1947 (Denord, 2015). In other words, neoliberalism has many
local narratives to tell, but has evolved into a highly globalising
discourse -- a discourse without borders, and without apparent
alternatives. It is the model that defines 'one size fits all' (Ball,
2012: 18).

A discourse without borders drives economic, super-powered,
globalisation (Ball, 2012). Globalisation is however, according
to Olssen and Peters (2005), a phenomenon that would be recognisable
within alternative technological and economic structures. Olssen and
Peters (2005: 314) argue that 'neoliberalism can be understood at one
level as a revival of many of the central tenets of classical
liberalism, particularly classical economic liberalism'. These tenets
include assumptions of: the individual as self-interested; the free
market and free trade as the best mechanisms to distribute resources;
and with any [government role limited to protecting the self-interested
individual, free trade, and the efficient operation of markets for
goods]{.underline} and services -- including public goods and services
traditionally associated with education (Apple, 2004; Ball,
2012; Denord, 2015; Tribe, 2015). These tenets construct a 'busnocratic
rationality' (Peters and Marshall, 2004: 109) that drives a wedge
between the academy and its social responsibility and educational
imagination (Sojot, 2018).

The [[role of government]{.underline}]{.mark} is the **[critical
difference]{.underline}** between classic and neo forms of liberalism,
and it is this role that is **[[most evident]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[concerns of
academics]{.underline}]{.mark} in relation to their role and
contributions as public and active scholars. In classic liberalism, as
noted above, the state doesn't so much as intervene as make sure
interventions don't occur that would impinge on and hence make less
effective the ideal conditions of the market. This view is supported by
the understanding of the individual as naturally predisposed to work
within those ideal conditions (Tribe, 2015). It could be argued that
this would result in an elevation in academic autonomy. In
neoliberalism, no such idea of the inevitability of the forces of nature
abide. Effective markets do not occur naturally and neither do
self-interested, [rational and autonomous individuals]{.underline}. 'In
neoliberalism the state seeks to create an individual that is an
enterprising and competitive entrepreneur' (Olssen and Peters, 2005:
315). The state then operates in 'the nexus between regulation and
midwifery... setting limits to the market, while at the same time
creating conditions within which the market can flourish and expand'
(Ball, 2012: 17).

For Peters et al. (2000: 317) neither the autonomous individual in
liberalism nor in neoliberalism can be understood as free 'because forms
of rationality and the laws within which the free market will be
required to operate and function will shape people as particular kinds
of subjects so that they will choose in general ways'. The rights to
local and/or individual autonomy are only apparent. In the words of
Jacques Donzelot (1979: 103), 'the more these rights are proclaimed, the
more the strangle hold of a tutelary authority tightens'.

Consistent with 20th century structuralist thinking, neoliberalism
offers an 'approach capable of explaining all human behaviour' (Gordon,
1991: 31) based on a belief that observation of behaviours in some
contexts are taken to describe the whole. This view was expounded by
Hayek, whose thinking has been regarded as critical to a shift from
liberalism to neoliberalism (Olssen and Peters, 2005; Tribe, 2015) and
the belief that education not only could be, but also should be
subjected to the economic theories of the market developed around the
sovereignty of the individual (Peters et al., 2000).

Neoliberalism draws in part from Hayek's theorisation of the efficacy of
the market and makes clear the limitations of a centralised economic
intervention (Tribe, 2015). For Hayek, a 'spontaneous societal order
such as a market order can utilize practical fragmented knowledge in a
way which a holistically planned order cannot' (Olssen and Peters, 2005:
318). In this sense the local 'self-organizing and self-replicating
structures emerge without design' (Olssen and Peters, 2005: 318).

Hayek's work is significant because elements of his thinking, notably
his views on the primacy of the local over the central, are clearly
rejected in the rise of neoliberal policy. The pervasion of new forms of
neoliberal government has arguably relied on the failure to distinguish
between a liberal and a neoliberal agenda. In the United Kingdom and
Aotearoa New Zealand, for instance, the rise of the new right was led in
part by the old left, with the promise of decentralisation of
conservative government power and structure.

While Hayek argued for the importance of markets for the regulation of
private-business conduct, it was James Buchanan and his collaborators
that argued for an extension of the market as a mechanism for the
institutional regulation of public sector organizational contexts
(Olssen and Peters, 2005: 317).

Public choice theory, led by Buchanan, clearly abides the
marginalisation of local knowledge to centralised 'education' agendas.
This is not to suggest, however, that the rise of liberalism through the
18th century did not have a clear centralised agenda for the efficient
functioning of the state (Arendt, 1963).

Normative implications are derived from public choice theory which carry
with them an approach to institutional reform. To the extent that
voluntary exchange is valued positively while coercion is valued
negatively, public choice theories favour market-like arrangements
and/or the decentralization of political authority (Peters and Marshall,
1996: 81--82).

The question, and largely the difference between the classical and the
neo forms of liberalism, is of how much to intervene, and hence also how
much to trust in non-intervention. Local, indigenous forms of knowledge
are irrelevant to a neoliberal agenda because this agenda requires
educating communities as to how they are expected to behave. The
justification of these forms of interventionism is provided in the idea
of the global economy and the associated rise and fall of apparent
economic success and failure. A global economy is a necessary condition
of neoliberalism. With the global holding sway over the local comes the
apparent foreclosure of alternative conceptualizations of education
(Kupferman, 2018). It is a neoliberal expectation that there be no
alternatives in education in the sense that alternatives create
messiness and uncertainty -- characteristics that education policies are
designed to eliminate. Hence, there is no space for asking questions
about different languages of education. Neither is there space to
'rework or resist a set of dominant space-bounded binaries such as
university/community, intellectual/practitioner, private/public, and
theory/practice that are invoked quite comfortably in both contemporary
mainstream and progressive education scholarship' (Tavares, 2018: 881).

The idea that [[education]{.underline}]{.mark} is the **[[very task of
questioning]{.underline}]{.mark}** such [[binaries]{.underline}]{.mark}
undermines the idea that the learner's task is irrefutably to understand
themselves as human capital and at the same time as an autonomous
rational consumer whose relationships are determined by the ability to
maximise choices in their own interests. As such the performance of
[[neoliberal policy in education 'denies']{.underline}]{.mark} local and
[[indigenous education]{.underline}]{.mark}s through efforts to argue
that education is a neutral, depoliticised space -- that the market is
the only fair educational mechanism because it operates based on a
universal nature that is unhampered by ideologies. In this sense,
neoliberal education agendas both forget and reject their own liberal
colonial past. However, the marketization of education and in particular
of higher education requires new knowledge in order to maintain a
stimulated market. This turns the critique of neoliberalism to the next
problem: the problem of local knowledge.

#### 'What is your alternative' [hobbles]{.underline} critical knowledge and is [irrelevant]{.underline}. 

**Fletcher '23** \[Robert; 2023; Ph.D., Professor of Sociology of
Development and Change at Wageningen University, Failing Forward: The
Rise and Fall of Neoliberal Conservation, "Traversing the Neoliberal
Fantasy," p. 210-214\]//neev

Dynamics like these warn us to be wary in our eagerness to start
celebrating ostensive alternatives too quickly. Pushing back against
this growing trend, Konings, for instance, echoes Foucault in asserting:

A [[major factor]{.underline}]{.mark} luring [progressive
intellectuals]{.underline} into the game [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
making **[[policy proposals]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the tyranny of "[[what is your
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}?"---that is, the notion that public
intellectuals only behave responsibly if they do not only offer
criticism but also put forward alternative policy proposals. However, in
situations where we find ourselves at many removes from the levers of
public authority, to prescribe policy alternatives is bound to be either
**[[presumptuous and pointless]{.underline}]{.mark}** (because the
political actors that we would like to carry our programs are nowhere to
be found) or conservative in its political implications (because after
many radical calls in the desert we learn to ratchet our ambitions down
to a level where they can easily be taken up by existing agencies). Once
we buy into the game of making policy proposals we can only sound
ridiculous and irrelevant or end up participating in the legitimation of
prevailing relations of power. We may be able to find a trade-off
between these two extremes, but we will have [[structurally
hobbled]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[capacity for the production of
critical knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}. (2009: 355)

Rather than succumb to this lure, Konings follows Hegel via Žižek (1993)
in advising us to "tarry with the negative," suggesting that, "For the
time being, the most productive role that progressive intellectuals can
play is to . . . trace and publicize the inconsistencies between
prevailing practices of power and their idealized representation in the
official institutions, narratives and symbols of our polity" (2009:
356).

I agree that this type of critical analysis has utility in its own
right, and that to be effective it must be followed through to the point
that one is certain one has fully understood the contours of the problem
at hand---what Haraway (2016), as previously noted, calls "staying with
the trouble." But I also agree with Haraway that we need not stop at
that point; we can instead attempt to tread the "fine line between
acknowledging the extent and seriousness of the troubles and succumbing
to abstract futurism and its affects of sublime despair and its politics
of sublime indifference" (2016: 4). While avoiding Konings' twin
pitfalls of either vacuous utopian fantasizing or outlining politically
pragmatic proposals---or alternately pursuing a diluted "trade-off
between these two extremes"---we can, I believe, still continue to point
toward the type of more radical change that would get us closer to the
sort of world we truly want to inhabit.

In the passage (quoted in full in note 6 of chapter 2) made famous by
Klein's (2007) analysis of his perspective as a "shock doctrine," Milton
Friedman claimed that the "basic function" of his cohort of neoliberal
ideologues was "to [[develop alternatives to existing
policie]{.underline}]{.mark}s, to keep them alive and available
[[until]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[politically
impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[becomes the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[politically inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Friedman 2002: xiv).
In pointing to this function, Friedman highlighted the interrelationship
between ideational and material dimensions of social change, asserting,
"Only a [[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}---actual or perceived---[[produces
real change]{.underline}]{.mark}. When that crisis occurs, the actions
that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around" (2002: xiv).
It is astounding how prescient this prognosis now appears, looking back
upon the neoliberal ascendance Friedman himself helped to orchestrate:
how the 1973 accumulation crisis indeed created the space for Friedman
and colleagues to promote the ideas they had been nurturing for decades
prior as the basis of the new world order, and in this way transforming
a philosophy that had indeed seemed "politically impossible" only a
short time before into what has now been able to assert itself as the
inevitable outcome of a teleological development.

In a parallel yet opposite strategy, therefore, we might follow
Friedman's lead in our own promotion of "vital alternatives" (Dressler
et al. 2014) to neoliberal conservation.4 For the reality, as outlined
in chapter 8, is that there is already a wealth of alternative
"transition discourses" in development throughout the world, via both
on-the-ground practice and more abstract conceptualization. The main
current impediment to fully realizing these is that, from the
perspective of a persistent neoliberal hegemony, [[they do appear
politically infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark} at present. Yet as Friedman
among others has taught us, such perceptions can be subject to
**[[dramatic transformation over time]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see also
Yurchak 2013). After all, one of the main functions of hegemony, noted
in chapter 1, is precisely to "define . . . what is realistic and what
is not realistic, and to drive certain aspirations and grievances into
the realm of the impossible, of idle dreams" (Scott 1990: 73). A main
strategy of both socialist and anarchist politics has thus been to make
"impossible demands" of the current social order so as to challenge this
hegemony and sustain the idea that, as the World Social Forum asserts,
another world is possible beyond the impoverished horizons of neoliberal
capitalism.

In addition to highlighting already existing alternative practices and
proposals and helping to flesh out the contours of the alternative
world(s) to which they point---the focus of the previous
chapter---another productive role for critical scholarship beyond
critique may be to explore the conditions of possibility that would
allow such alternatives to become first imaginable and then realistic.
This is my aim in the following.

#### Economic value debating is good.

**Toussaint '23** \[Etienne; February 2023; Assistant Professor of Law,
University of South Carolina School of Law; California Law Review, "The
Purpose of Legal Education," vol. 111\]

\[\*26\] [[As **students**]{.mark} **learn** to [articulate]{.mark}
**diverse [arg]{.mark}**ument[**s** across]{.mark} these **various
[modes]{.mark}** [of **legal reasoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} - [[from
**procedural fairness**]{.underline}]{.mark}, to legal equality, to
historical precedent - [[they express **implicit moral
values**]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether they be a \"universalist regard
for the common humanity of persons\" or an \"instinctual and unthinking,
discrimination between them.\" 126By graduation, law [students come to
not only **embrace** these **moral values**]{.underline} - in some
cases, without even realizing it - but also their attendant framings of
liberty and equality. Thus, I agree that it seems far reaching to
conclude that law students are being trained to become amoralists, as
some suggest. Rather, law students are being acculturated toward a
distinctive type of morality that shapes their professional lawyering
identity - liberal legalism. 127 Robin West defines liberal legalism in
the United States - which she terms \"American legalism\" - not as a
jurisprudential articulation of the nature of law, but rather as \"a
particular set of values both reflected in and grounding a complex set
of practices, articulated in a large, even vast, collection of texts,
and yielded by a swath of shared history \... that defines a way of
being in the world.\" 128In other words, the modern practice of using
analogical reasoning and precedential authority to guide legal analysis
means legal conclusions will often reflect both the evolution of U.S.
legal history and the moral commitments of those trained in U.S. law.
[[These **moral commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark} - e.g., a concern for
**[basic fairness]{.underline}**, a respect for horizontal equity, a
regard for precedent, and a deference toward individual rights, to name
a few - reflect a distinct perspective on human dignity, human equality,
human liberty, and human moral striving. Law school\'s challenge lies
not in its inculcation of these values, which are deeply embedded in
America\'s political traditions. Rather, the problem arises from the
moral virtue that is often missing: justice. As Phyllis Goldfarb argues,
\"[**Legal culture** [induces]{.mark} [**acquiescence** to]{.mark}
**institutional [structures]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are [[built
on]{.mark} the **values** of **[liberal
capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [while obscuring **recognition** that
these values are preordained choices [derived from a]{.mark} particular
[set of **power relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 129

Indeed, while law [[students]{.mark} grow accustomed to **debating** the
**procedural fairness**]{.underline} [of law,
**[rarely]{.mark}**]{.underline} [do they [engage]{.mark} the
**[substantive justice]{.mark}**]{.underline} of those very same legal
rules, \[\*27\] [which tend to **imbue** the **unfair power dynamics**
that current notions of justice would oppose.]{.underline} 130 To be
sure, this claim does not imply that law students are not taught to
critique the merits of legislation and judicial opinions. The primary
goal of Socratic questioning - when it is done right - is to inspire
such debate.

131Rather, it reveals that law students do explore whether rules are
applied fairly across varying constituencies, and law students do
consider whether rules advance public policy by maximizing benefits over
costs, or by promoting efficiency over waste. Yet, importantly, law
students rarely assess whether these framings of law\'s underlying
normative commitments - i.e., fairness as equality of access; public
good as the maximization of collective welfare, etc. - are themselves
morally just. 132Even more, law students are not customarily given tools
to meaningfully answer such philosophical questions because law school
courses rarely discuss theories of justice and their implications for
human behavior within political economic institutions. 133 Instead,
doctrinal law school courses often convey a jurisprudence rooted in a
\"fidelity to law\" framing of professional lawyering, not an identity
rooted in a fidelity to community or social justice. 134In Lawyers and
Fidelity to Law, Bradley Wendel - esteemed for his work on morality and
legal ethics in liberal \[\*28\] democratic societies 135- describes
\"fidelity to law\" as the highest value guiding the lawyer\'s
professional obligation, not fidelity to a client\'s personal goals or
to broader societal justice-oriented goals. 136As Wendel explains,
fidelity to law establishes the political legitimacy of positive law,
and safeguards citizens\' rights and entitlements under law. 137By
elevating procedural fairness over individual preferences and interests,
law separates \"raw power\" from the \"reason-giving\" judgments of
public and private dispute-resolution proceedings, fostering peace and
stability in democratic governance, 138while upholding the adversarial
structure of adjudication. 139Further, procedural fairness welcomes
\"normative criticism\" of good-faith claims of right or entitlement,
140while allowing the lawyer to be \"a friend\" without bearing
responsibility for institutional harms. 141 Wendel grounds the fidelity
to law framing in the standard conception of legal ethics, which
confines the lawyer\'s role to the ethical principles of: (1)
partisanship; (2) neutrality; and (3) moral nonaccountability,
ultimately affirming the amorality of law practice. 142Rather than cater
to their clients\' individual preferences and interests, the lawyer\'s
primary role is to advocate for their clients\' legal rights and
entitlements under law, which upholds the \[\*29\] legitimacy of the
rule of law, 143and affirms the client\'s autonomy before the law.
144For the lawyer to do otherwise, under this view, represents a
jurisprudential breach of faith 145that undermines the social
achievements of law and the loyalty of citizens to the rule of law.
146Wendel further argues that the legal system\'s ability to resolve
disputes in a public forum governed by reason imbues it with moral value
that precludes a need for lawyers to consider \"ordinary morality.\"
147This restraint binds the lawyer to their prescribed roles and
functions within the legal system, enabling an \"institutional
settlement\" that preserves pluralism and \"the positive legal
obligations in the code of ethics.\" 148 In fairness, Wendel does admit
that when legal outcomes fail to comport with norms of justice, thereby
eroding political legitimacy, the lawyer can counsel moral dissent and
political protest. 149Yet, here, the primacy of fidelity to law comes
into question, as ordinary morality and notions of substantive justice
are critical to the lawyer\'s assessment of the perceived justice of
their client\'s legal outcomes, lest the lawyer place sole faith in the
inherent justice of the legal system itself. 150In other words, what is
justice, and who decides? As both Wendel and Luban note, defending a
client\'s autonomy under a fidelity to law approach to lawyering can
sometimes harm innocent parties, as evidenced in the famous Dalkon
Shield intrauterine device products liability case. 151After the Dalkon
Shield was found to cause infections that sterilized a
disproportionately large percentage of women users, the A.H. Robins
Company \[\*30\] was sued for defective product tort liability.
152During pre-trial discovery, the defense counsel developed a list of
\"dirty questions\" to ask female litigants about their sexual and
hygienic practices under a theory that there could have been alternate
causes for the harms suffered by the plaintiffs. 153Many concluded that
the questions were designed as an intimidation tactic to convince women
to abandon their case against the company. 154More generally, it
demonstrates how process can obscure substantive justice. In contrast to
a fidelity to law approach, Anthony Alfieri points toward a \"fidelity
to community\" and social justice movements that \"builds spiritual
kinship,\" \"permits lawyers to reflect emotionally and intellectually
in situations of partisan conflict,\" and \"enables lawyers to listen
and communicate across boundaries of difference, power, and privilege.\"
155Even the standard conception of legal ethics, Alfieri contends,
provides latitude for creative forms of partisanship, such as
cooperative lawyer-client roles that facilitate \"lawyer moral
accountability and political participation\" while supporting democratic
community-building campaigns and what Gerald P. Lopez called
\"rebellious\" legal advocacy strategies. 156For example, the
organization Law For Black Lives was established as a community of
lawyers and citizen activists working collaboratively to combat racial
justice, promote progressive law reform, and build community power.
157The commitment of such lawyers to grassroots social movements upholds
the lawyer\'s moral accountability for social injustice perpetuated by
law. Consequently, it is spiritual kinship with social justice movements
that feels blunted by Wendel\'s \[\*31\] articulation of the social
value of lawyering within the confines of liberal democratic
institutions. While fidelity to law facilitates political legitimacy, it
also can produce a chilling effect upon the lawyer\'s consideration of
ordinary morality and substantive justice during the lawyering process,
infringing on their ability to express moral dissent and engage in
political protest before ordered judgment renders an unjust decision.
158For example, what moral compass guides the well-intentioned lawyer
when U.S. law lags behind international human rights? While it may seem
impractical, or even dangerous, for society to ask lawyers to make
ongoing moral evaluations of their clients\' goals, 159one must consider
whether it is a good idea for lawyers to \"disentangle their judgments
about what was required or permitted by the law of their society from
their individual judgments about justice and morality.\" 160 The U.S.
civil rights movement provides but one example of the moral failings of
law, and the need for lawyers to protest unjust laws and advocate for
law reform. 161The legal memos justifying the torture of detainees
during the War on Terror provides yet another. 162The lawyer does not
abuse law through disobedience to law. Rather, moral dissent and
political protest aligns the lawyer with the morality and accountability
of the client\'s cause, signaling a \"legal-political partisanship \...
for which advocates must morally account.\" 163It is the \[\*32\]
lawyer\'s good-faith belief in the ordinary morality and substantive
justice of their client\'s cause that elevates their legal advocacy to a
\"moral witness\" that preserves the plurality of political and cultural
values within the demos. 164Such \"hopeful acts of faithful witness and
defiance\" enable a participatory democracy built upon \"cooperative
power not obedience to power.\" 165 This vision of public citizenship -
the lawyer fueled by righteous indignation against those with corrupted
power - has served as an important part of civil rights and social
justice advocacy throughout U.S. history. Unfortunately, it remains
peripheral to many law school curricula. As the next Section clarifies,
this dilemma has long troubled legal education in the United States.
Lest we remain doomed to repeat our mistakes, we must revisit history to
remake the future. II. THE POLITICS OF LAW SCHOOL IDENTITY Before
exploring the call to transform legal education, one must first consider
the competing interests and roles of a law school. More than simply a
school, law school is perhaps best classified as an educational
\"institution\" - an integrated network of formal rules, informal
customs, and social norms that govern the interactions of students,
teachers, researchers, and administrators operating within a dynamic
learning community. Law courses, law clinics, law reviews, and legal
research centers all comprise disparate aspects of the \"schooling\" of
law, and collectively work toward achieving a commonly shared,
multifaceted institutional purpose. 166As a result, the hybridized
nature of law school as a business entity bound by multiple varied, and
at times competing, institutional logics has made its analysis complex.
One might deem law school as a political institution as well. Law school
not only shapes the formation and evolution of law, but it also
influences the political process. It does so by training the very
lawyers who craft laws and public policies as lawmakers, enforce
contracts and legal judgments as judges, protect democracy and
citizenship as legislators, and champion the public interest as legal
advocates and activists. This Section adopts a historical
institutionalist approach toward the study of law school\'s political
identity, framing evolving patterns of institutional change in legal
education as historically contingent and influenced by human \[\*33\]
behaviors and ideological beliefs. 167According to historical
institutionalists, how one behaves within an institution, and how an
institution evolves and changes across time in response to human
behaviors, depends as much on the institution\'s historical context as
it does on individual engagement with institutional rules and norms.
168Given law school\'s historical role in training many of the
individuals who construct, shape, and regulate the sociopolitical
institutions that govern lawyer interactions, historical
institutionalism provides the best analytical framework to consider how
law school\'s purpose, and accordingly its cultural identity, has
shifted across time in response to its historical, sociopolitical, and
cultural context. To clarify the institutional hybridity of law school,
Part II.A discusses the historic debate between legal formalists and
legal realists on the nature of law, the methods of legal reasoning and
jurisprudential analysis, and their implications for legal education.
Then, Part II.B demonstrates how ideology - specifically, market-based
notions of lawyering practice-readiness within a primarily functionalist
vision of law in society - have shaped conceptions of professionalism in
legal education, effectively sidelining law school\'s public purpose.
Collectively, these observations demonstrate that law school\'s identity
crisis, as it were, is not new. Further, they reveal that the ongoing
struggle to reconcile law school\'s purpose with societal calls for
racial reckoning has been hampered by law school\'s pedagogical
commitment to a functionalist view of law in society. A. Law School and
Justice Law school has long been viewed as both a training ground for
future attorneys to study formal principles of law and lawyering
practice, and as a public forum to consider and debate law\'s evolution
as an instrument of social change. 169Discerning how law disrupts,
resolves, or perpetuates social and \[\*34\] economic inequality has
motivated the work of judges, lawyers, law makers, law professors, and
law students since law school\'s inception. However, the diversity of
behaviors, attitudes, and pedagogical practices of law faculty seeking
to achieve law school\'s multifaceted purpose, and the concomitant
experiences of law students in the classroom, have been shaped by
differing views on the relationship between law and society. Is law the
product of dominant cultural and political views, or is law the
embodiment of abstract moral and philosophical principles applied to
sociopolitical institutions? Consider first the early debates between
legal formalists and legal realists on the nature of law and its
implications for law teaching. 1. Formalism and Realism in Legal
Education Legal education\'s ability to address how law perpetuates
inequality is minimized by its focus on formalism and realism. The
formation of professional lawyering identity has historically occurred
through two disparate modes of law teaching: (1) the Socratic
case-dialogue model that still dominates the standard law school
classroom experience; 170and (2) the legal apprenticeship model that has
become emblematic of clinical legal education. 171While both modes of
law teaching shape how law students develop legal acumen and form
professional lawyering identity, they have historically promoted
inconsistent values and divergent professional norms. 172While the
Socratic case-dialogue model emphasizes \"formal knowledge and
scientific rationality in legal analysis,\" the apprenticeship model
invokes \"traditions of craft, judgment, and public responsibility.\"
173The dominance of formal knowledge in the modern research university -
typified by an emphasis on logocentric thinking and deductive logical
analysis - has primarily shaped the collective consciousness of U.S. law
schools since their incorporation into the university. \[\*35\] Building
upon legal positivist theories of reason and truth birthed during the
Enlightenment Period, the idea of formal knowledge in law, or legal
formalism, gained prominence in the late nineteenth century as a guiding
normative theory of law. 174Legal formalism posits that lawyers and
judges can use reason and rationality to discern abstract principles of
law from the objective facts of court cases. 175Influenced by this
framing of law, Christopher Columbus Langdell, joined by fellow legal
educators of his day, organized U.S. law into discrete subject areas -
e.g., contracts, property, torts, civil procedure, etc. - that could be
taught entirely from common law cases. 176Prior to Langdell\'s
institutionalization of the case-dialogue method of law teaching at
Harvard Law School - the method was later popularized by James Barr Ames
177- legal education in the United States primarily consisted of
studying: (1) legal treatises that summarized the law; and (2)
influential works of literature from the Western canon that wielded
cultural and political authority. 178To solidify law\'s place in the
modern research university, Langdell crafted an epistemology of law as a
science. Teaching law students how to rationally apply objective legal
principles to factual scenarios with analogical reasoning, Langdell
thereby crafted the formality, autonomy, completion, and ultimately, the
virtue of the common law. 179Under Langdell\'s vision, lectures
summarizing the law were largely abandoned in favor of a Socratic
pedagogy of interrogating students to elicit the important facts, legal
issues, and court holdings of judicial opinions. 180By utilizing
critical thinking and deductive reasoning to discern legal conclusions
from abstract factual scenarios, law students learned how to \"think\[\]
like a \[\*36\] lawyer.\" 181The Langdellian case-dialogue method, or
case method, as it is commonly known today, became the dominant strategy
of teaching cognitive lawyering skills to future attorneys. Yet, almost
from inception, the formalist approach to law teaching was met with
resistance from those who believed that abstract legal theory requires
social and political context to derive its true meaning. 182Legal
formalists in the academy, affectionately called \"Langdellian
formalists,\" 183had rendered issues of morality and politics as
irrelevant to doctrinal analysis because objective legal principles
presumably stood independent from subjective political and social
institutions. 184Further, according to formalists, since judges merely
deduce logical legal conclusions by objectively applying timeless legal
principles to new factual scenarios, the role of the judge is
fundamentally to uphold private property and contractual rights, while
protecting liberal entitlements against \"paternalistic or
redistributive interventions by state or federal legislators,\" 185not
to make new law. However, in 1881, critics such as Oliver Wendell
Holmes, Jr., argued that a sole focus on objectivity and rationality in
doctrinal analysis disregarded \"the prevalent moral and political
theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the
prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men.\" 186In 1908, in
Muller v. Oregon, then-lawyer Louis Brandeis became one of the first
lawyers to turn toward social science in litigation to help clarify the
lived \[\*37\] experience of law. 187Roscoe Pound brought such critiques
into the debate on legal pedagogy, arguing for an interdisciplinary
approach to the study of \"law in books\" and \"law in action.\"
188Later, critics such as Jerome Frank in 1933 noted that the judicial
opinion represents merely a fragment of the legal case, rendering it
insufficient to convey the complexity of the lawyering process and the
breadth of the legal issues at stake. 189Even more, these realists, as
they would become called, contended that the formalist approach to law
study discounts the morality of law by diminishing the lawyer\'s unique
ethical responsibilities as a public citizen. 190The absence of
discourse on the morality of law, coupled with a Socratic case-dialogue
method that often filters \"radical\" critiques of liberal ideas out of
the classroom, would come to inspire feelings of \"ethical relativism
and nihilism\" among law students, generating the disorientation that
pervades many law schools today. 191 As the American legal realist
tradition grew during the early twentieth century, scholars began
calling for expanded experiential learning programs. 192In the 1930s,
law professors primarily at Yale Law School and Columbia Law School
further developed the alternative theory of jurisprudence called legal
realism as a response to the dominance of legal formalism. 193Building
upon the legacy of Holmes, Brandeis, and Pound, these legal realists
rejected the notion \[\*38\] of law as a static body of neutral
principles and dissented on most, if not all, of legal formalism\'s
objective framings of the rule of law. 194To the legal realist, the
concept of law is a product of human political will, not the
manifestation of legal reasoning applied to facts. Indeed, legal
principles applied to the facts of cases are rarely neutral and
unbiased. Instead, as legal realists such as Benjamin Cardozo argued,
they are deeply influenced by the political and moral choices of judges
and lawyers. 195Contrary to the objectivity of legal formalism, American
legal realists argued that jurisprudence should rely upon empirical
evidence, much like the methods of natural science, 196thereby enabling
sociological insights, for example, to serve as a gap-filler when the
law fails to contextualize community needs properly. 197Pound referred
to such an approach as \"sociological jurisprudence,\" whereby \"the
sociological jurist pursues a comparative study of legal systems, legal
doctrines, and legal institutions as social phenomena, and criticizes
them with respect to their relation to social conditions and social
progress.\" 198 Within the academy, legal realists argued that law
students should be exposed to law\'s practical application through the
study of legislation, or what some scholars have deemed
\"legisprudence.\" 199Such insights, they argued, challenge students to
consider how existing legal rules and political arrangements reflect
power imbalances in society that demand law reform. 200In many ways,
legal realists sought a reconciliation of the construction of law as an
abstract theory of principles with the operation of law as a practical
tool for socio-political ends. 201Early legal realists, such as Jerome
Frank, believed that it was the duty of law schools to expose their
students to the complex relationship between theory and practice, urging
the creation of law school clinics in 1933 in one of the most
influential early articles on clinical legal education, Why Not a
\[\*39\] Clinical Lawyer-School? 202Other legal scholars shared Frank\'s
perspective on legal education, inspiring the creation of early
experiments with clinical legal education at schools across the country,
including the University of Denver in 1904, Harvard Law School in 1913,
the University of Southern California in 1928, Duke Law School in 1931,
the University of Tennessee in 1947, and the University of Chicago in
1957. 203Eventually, law schools began integrating public law courses
into the curriculum that engaged the political dimensions of lawyering,
such as constitutional law and administrative law. 204By the 1960s,
funding from the Ford Foundation helped to launch the modern clinical
legal education movement, enriching the public purpose of law school
with pro bono legal service toward the local community. 205 Thus,
clinical legal education emerged, in part, to counter the shortcomings
of Langdellian formalism and the positivist ethos of the modern research
university that then dominated modern legal education. 206At the outset,
law school clinics in the modern era of legal education were designed to
teach law students practical lawyering skills 207and inspire a
commitment to public service. 208More recently, the Carnegie Foundation
has emphasized experiential \[\*40\] learning as a vehicle to enhance
practical skills training. Specifically, they note clinical legal
education\'s role in facilitating two critical apprenticeships that
complement cognitive skills training: (1) a skill-based apprenticeship
in lawyering practice; and (2) a behavioral apprenticeship in ethics and
professional judgment. 209This practice-oriented perspective is also
reflected in the ABA\'s 1979 Cramton Report, 210the 1992 MacCrate
Report, 211and the 2007 Best Practices for Legal Education report,
212each seeking to revive apprentice traditions in legal education by
emphasizing the need to cultivate critical thinking, problem-solving,
research, negotiation, communication, ethical judgment, and civic
commitment skills among law students. 213 Eventually, both legal
formalists and legal realists came to coexist in the legal academy,
engaging in debate on the nature of law, the nature of adjudication, the
role of politics in law, and the implications of the Constitution and
the common law for the lived experiences of marginalized citizens. 214
\[\*41\] Further, law school curriculums eventually came to reflect both
the formalist and realist traditions in legal education, emphasizing
legal theory through case law analysis in the Socratic classroom while
simultaneously offering experiential learning opportunities for skill
simulation and legislative advocacy in the law school clinic. 215 Yet,
it has become increasingly clear that this dominant dual approach to
legal education - the so-called theory-practice dichotomy 216- has not
positioned law students to develop critical lawyering judgment fully and
a professional identity attuned to the moral complexities of lawyering
in a political economy marred by systemic racism and structural
inequality. 217How do law schools ensure that in their turn toward
practice, they teach their students how to identify strains of
hierarchy, racism, and structural oppression that taint law and
lawyering practice? Consider next the philosophical underpinnings of
legal formalism and legal realism. This Article argues that both legal
formalism and legal realism exhibit focused attention on ensuring that
legal decision-making can be perceived as a kind of science, but largely
understate the imperative for lawyers to discern the morality of law
itself. This substructure, ultimately reflecting a commitment to a
\"functionalist\" view of the law, 218has profound implications for
legal ethics in the modern era. 2. Morality and Ethics in Legal
Education One of the accomplishments of Langdellian formalism, as
articulated by Robert Ferguson in Law and Letters in American Culture,
was to divorce the \[\*42\] authority of U.S. law from the canon of the
Western humanities. 219Prior to the introduction of Langdellian
formalism, legal education in the United States dating to the early
1700s primarily comprised the study of legal treatises, the opinions of
British common law judges, and diverse texts of cultural and political
authority. 220During this \"Jeffersonian tradition\" of legal education,
as Robin West calls it, 221law students were expected to follow one of
two tracks: the young men could travel to England and train at the Inns
of Court, 222or they could apprentice in the law office of an
established practitioner. 223In either case, they were expected to
digest significant works of philosophy, science, and religion that
engaged important moral and ethical questions of the day, such as the
meaning of justice in America\'s burgeoning democratic project. 224To be
sure, not all seeking to practice law were trained in the Jeffersonian
tradition. Indeed, African Americans and Jews, for example, were barred
from such pathways to practice due to racial discrimination. 225Even for
those who did not face such barriers, trained lawyers fell short of
crafting laws and public policies that promoted justice as a moral
virtue for all inhabitants of the land that would become the United
States. Notwithstanding, the Jeffersonian lawyer - as a \"man of law and
letters\" - understood the normative authority of culture and the
ethical imperative for lawyers to consider culture\'s influence on the
rule of law. Perhaps driven by a meritocratic vision of a legal
profession divorced from the \"high culture\" of the political elite,
226Christopher Langdell shifted the education of law into the modern
research university as a learned profession. By confining the content of
legal education to the black letter law itself under the guiding
normative theory of legal formalism, Langdell repositioned the lawyer\'s
stance from ideological spokesman of neoclassical ideals to professional
advocate for the so-called common man. 227In so doing, Harvard Law
School became the first modern American law school with Langdell serving
as dean \[\*43\] from 1870 to 1895. 228Legal education was coordinated
into a three-year post-baccalaureate degree program, 229and law was
declared an autonomous body of knowledge. Consequently, legal education
was severed from studying morality, philosophical ethics, and political
theory. Legal realists did not meaningfully engage the philosophical and
moral dimensions of law in their critique of legal formalism. Legal
realists argued that judicial opinions are inherently legislative, and
therefore, judges should look beyond the law when assessing the facts of
the cases in their docket. 230Some scholars pointed toward political
science, economics, and ethics as necessary components of legal analysis
and thus legal education. For example, in 1869, Yale Law School began
permitting law students to enroll in interdisciplinary courses.
231Cornell Law School began encouraging history and political science
courses in the late 1800s. 232However, in most instances, legal realists
did not point toward historical works in the Western canon that
clarified the cultural, philosophical, and political dimensions of law.
Nor did they point toward contemporary works of literature and
non-fiction that might reveal socio-political norms and cultural values
that frame legal analysis. Instead, legal realists primarily urged
courts to emulate the methods of natural science and turn toward
empirical evidence. Indeed, during the 1880s, the American Bar
Association called for more social science in the law school curriculum.
233 Thus, the legal realist critique was largely a methodological
process of deconstruction. By using empirical social science to promote
skepticism about legal rules and legal facts, 234legal realists exposed
the indeterminacy of legal judgments and their tendency to \"pass off
contingent judgments as inexorable.\" 235By leveraging real-world
empirical insights from statistics, economics, and sociology, legal
realists contended that judges could fill \[\*44\] knowledge gaps in the
law with contextual judgments that would enable legal opinions to
reflect the real world. 236Yet, while legal realists demonstrated the
indeterminacy of law and the value of politics in legal education,
neither legal formalists nor legal realists advocated for robust
integration of morality, philosophical legal ethics, or political theory
in their analysis of law, and in legal education more generally. 237
Ultimately, legal formalism and realism remain trapped, as Robert Gordon
explained in his 1984 influential article Critical Legal Histories, in a
\"functionalist\" vision of law in society. Functionalism has long
dominated liberal legal scholarship and has often prevented the law from
adequately responding to the needs of society. Writers that adhere to
this dominant tradition \"divide the world into two spheres, one social
and one legal.\" 238The \"legal system\" is a \"specialized realm of
state and professional activity\" that is auxiliary to society, and that
realm is \"called into being by the primary social world in order to
serve that world\'s needs.\" 239 Such a view dramatically reduces the
scope of scholarly discourse to questions about the law\'s functional
responsiveness to social needs: \"Is law a dependent or independent
variable?\" \"Is everything about law \... determined by society\"?
\"Does law have \"autonomous\' internal structures or logic?\" 240To put
it simply, must researchers only consider how the legal system should
respond to evolving social needs? The formalist emphasizes a restrictive
notion of law as judge-made and thus focuses on doctrinal reform,
whereas the realist recognizes the added importance of legislation and
calls for broad-based public policy reform. 241Yet, this false dichotomy
presumes - and this insight is a key motivation for the integration of
critical theory in legal education - that there is \"an objective,
determined, progressive social evolutionary path.\" 242 In other words,
while formalists and realists differ on how the law must adapt to social
movements, they tacitly agree that the \"natural and proper\"
evolutionary movement of society is toward \"the type of liberal
capitalism seen in the advanced Western nations (especially the United
States).\" 243This moral \[\*45\] commitment to modern global capitalism
and Western liberal democracy as the undisputed champion of modernity
must be seen as that - a moral commitment that rejects alternate
conceptions of political economy, such as socialism, authoritarianism,
or variations of the two. Some legal realists, such as Karl Llewellyn,
244Robert Hale, 245and Charles Hamilton Houston, 246challenged this
moral view, especially as it pertained to race relations during the Jim
Crow era of state-sanctioned racial apartheid in the United States. But,
as one might expect because of its functionalist commitments, legal
realists largely avoided racial justice issues that called into question
the structural underpinnings of the U.S. political economy. 247Indeed,
an earnest consideration of alternate framings of modernity in the legal
educational context would demand a critique of the law\'s very role in
their denouncement. Critical legal theories of law emerged in the legal
academy to push back against this position. 3. Critical Pedagogies and
Clinical Legal Education As clinical legal education expanded during the
1970s and 1980s, building upon the social and political ferment of the
civil rights movement, the localist legal services approach to public
interest lawyering faced criticism by leftist legal scholars of the
emerging critical legal studies (CLS) movement. As Robert Gordon
described the anti-authoritarian and moralistic movement in 1987: CLS is
a movement mostly of law teachers, but also including some
practitioners, which started for most of us in the late 1960s or early
1970s out of a sense of dissatisfaction with our own legal education\...
. It is a movement in pursuit of some shared political and social
objectives \... to realize the potential we believe exists to transform
the practices of the legal system to help make this a more decent,
equal, solidary society - less intensively ordered by hierarchies of
class, status, \"merit,\' race, and gender - more decentralized,
democratic, and participatory both in its own forms of social life and
in the forms it promotes in other countries. 248 The CLS critique
emerged alongside a change in the nature of public interest law practice
and law school clinics. At law schools across the United \[\*46\]
States, law clinics began integrating a diversity of lawyering
strategies across a wide spectrum of issue areas, from transactional
lawyering for early-stage small businesses, 249to movement lawyering
within distressed low-income communities, 250to legislative advocacy for
environmental justice campaigns, 251to the criminal defense of
non-violent offenders in overpoliced low-income neighborhoods. 252 This
expansion has not been without its critics. Some legal scholars have
questioned whether adopting a cross-disciplinary social justice mission
within law school clinical programs has politicized law teaching.
253Others have questioned whether such progressive law clinics impose
unwanted scrutiny from law school donors or public funders, harming the
business purpose of legal education and underscoring neoliberalism\'s
enduring influence on law school policies and practices. 254Yet,
critical legal theorists maintain that lawyers always bring personal and
political perspectives to their legal work with clients during the
formation of professional judgment. 255Even more, scholars argue that
political ideology and market forces - i.e., market fundamentalism in
the modern U.S. political economy - have always shaped the culture of
legal education, 256and in some cases, driving legal pedagogy away from
the needs of subordinated, marginalized, and minoritized populations.
Furthermore, legal clinics are not a panacea. While recently proposed
apprenticeship-styled models of law school curricular reform respond to
the practice-readiness demands of the market, they can obscure the role
law schools \[\*47\] play in shaping the moral dimensions of
professional lawyering identity. 257Notwithstanding the growth of
clinical legal education, law schools largely continue to divide legal
theory and lawyering practice in both law teaching and legal
scholarship. Further, in the conventional first-year law curriculum and
many upper-level law courses, there remains an emphasis on the
case-dialogue method over lawyering skills training. Indeed, the law
school clinic is often framed as a transitional \"learning laboratory\"
where students gain practical lawyering skills that will make them
marketable for future employment. Yet, by relegating legal theory (and
its critiques) to the formalistic case-dialogue classroom, and lawyering
practice to the law school clinic, many law schools have reduced public
citizenship to \"a largely aspirational function sounded in tropes.\"
258 Although many law schools have begun to integrate policy-oriented
and practice-based pedagogies throughout the law curriculum, these
\"pedagogies of practice\" can, nevertheless, succumb to the pressures
of market-centered limits on the scope of public citizenship. 259For
example, some law school curriculums boast expanded experiential
learning programs, yet overlook the pedagogical value of critical
theories of law and movement law because such topics are deemed too
political. 260In so doing, these programs risk training law students who
will enter the profession without critical insights on how best to serve
clients differentiated by class, gender, and race. 261The modern
\"reformed\" curriculum often grounds new pedagogical methods in
\"positivist norms of neutrality\" and \"individualist norms of liberal
legalism.\" 262This results in a \"new formalism\" that elides cultural
context, obscures systemic racism, and legitimates structural oppression
by teaching law students how to sustain the status quo. 263As another
example, some law faculty avoid classroom discussion on the dynamics of
racial and class-based subordination, falling prey to ideologies of
\"colorblindness\" in \[\*48\] the law that ignore the sociocultural
implications of bias and racialized narratives of minoritized
populations. 264To be sure, such conversations can be both uncomfortable
and difficult to manage. 265Yet, without such insights, law students may
struggle to develop critical perspectives of law, legal judgments, and
legal reasoning necessary to promote progressive reforms as practicing
attorneys. 266 B. Law School and Political Economy Alongside the debate
on the formalist and realist traditions in law teaching, the influence
of neoliberalism on the legal profession has also threatened the public
purpose of legal education. 267Law\'s engagement with moral conceptions
of justice in the United States can be traced to the Court of Chancery
in England, where citizens petitioned the Lord Chancellor for
\"equitable\" remedies for certain non-monetary harms. As an
administrative body concerned with natural law, chancery courts served
as a counterweight to the application of rigid, and potentially harsh,
common law rules that governed competitive market economies. 268The Lord
Chancellor, serving as Keeper of the King\'s Conscience, applied
equitable remedies - e.g., specific performance and injunctions - to
remedy aggrieved parties who could not be adequately compensated with
monetary damages. 269In other words, lawyers advocating before such
forums sought to push back against the unfairness of legal systems
themselves. Yet, such doctrines of equity in the United States have been
on a century-long decline, influencing the trajectory of legal
education. 270For example, the defense of unconscionability in contract
law has been weakened and is now an uncommon \[\*49\] basis for relief.
271The concept of a tort has become \"demoralized,\" more commonly
conveying a reallocation of costs for efficiency purposes than equitable
compensation to remedy an injustice. 272The notion of \"fairness\" in
adjudicatory civil procedure has given way to principles of contractual
intent and freedom of bargaining, justifying arbitration clauses in
contracts of adhesion that harm low-income workers. 273 In sum,
America\'s doctrines of equity have undergone a steady process of
privatization. One reason for this shift might be the influence of the
law and economics movement, which sought to frame the functionality of
law through the language of economics. As early as 1937, the Chicago Law
School began to advocate for more economics training in legal education.
274Ronald Coase\'s publication of The Nature of the Firm in 1937,
275followed by his tenure at Chicago Law School from 1964 to 1982,
helped to develop law and economics approaches in torts, property, and
contract law. In the 1970s, Guido Calabresi\'s The Cost of Accidents and
Richard Posner\'s Economic Analysis of Law further strengthened the
dominance of \"efficiency\" and \"cost minimization\" as normative
principles guiding legal analysis. 276More recently, this shift toward
market-centric framings of law has been amplified by the rising
pressures of neoliberalism in American democracy. 277

To be sure, legal scholars have long critiqued the rise of neoliberalism
in the United States. Most recently, the scholarship emerging out of the
Law and Political Economy Project (LPE), housed at Yale Law School, has
advanced the critical view that \"[developments over the last several
decades in [legal **scholarship**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[\*50\] [[and
**policy**]{.mark} helped to [facilitate]{.mark} **rising
[inequality]{.mark}** and **precarity**]{.underline}, political
[**[alienation]{.mark}**, the [**entrenchment** of **racial
hierarchies**]{.mark}]{.underline} and intersectional exploitation, and
ecological and social catastrophe.\" 278As LPE contributors David Singh
Grewal and Jedediah Purdy explain, \"[Neoliberalism]{.underline}, like
classical liberalism before it, [is also associated with a kind of
ideological expansionism, in which market-modeled concepts of efficiency
and autonomy shape policy, doctrine, and other discourses of legitimacy
outside of traditionally \"economic\']{.underline} areas.\"
279[Neoliberalism **frames** how lawyers and policymakers **ask
questions**, envision progress, and **construe** the **values** of
liberty, equality, and democracy into tangible policy-based
solutions]{.underline}. For the practicing attorney, the moral
imperatives of justice are pitted against the political demands of
laissez-faire economics and free market capitalism. 280Further, as
Corinne Blalock argues, neoliberalism operates in a hegemonic fashion as
political rationality - a \"discursive logic that legitimates exercises
of power\" by structuring the language of policy debates and defining
the limits of governmental activism. 281In so doing, [[**neoliberal**
politics]{.mark} have [justified]{.mark} the [**creation** of **laws**
and]{.mark} **public [policies]{.mark}** [that promote \"**rational**\"
**econ**]{.mark}omic [**behaviors** under the **guise** of
**protecting** individual **h**]{.mark}uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights]{.underline}. Yet, even as neoliberal culture has
inspired \"the creation of stable and well-protected property rights,
enforcement of private contracts, and limitation of the arbitrary
exercise of government power,\" 282it has also shaped assumptions about
the capacity (and legitimacy) of government to enact progressive visions
of collective well-being. Legal scholars have also long debated the
moral dimensions of the liberal philosophy that lie at the heart of
neoliberalism. 283By perpetuating ideals of entrepreneurialism built
upon private orderings of contract and property law, neoliberalism
exalts private solutions to collective problems instead of public
accountability to democratic ideals. By leaving individuals and families
\"facing entrenched profit-making interests on their own as they try to
protect their health, seek an education, or look for social support,\"
284neoliberalism strips government \[\*51\] of its substantive role in
building a democratic vision of society 285- what Martin Luther King,
Jr., referred to as the \"beloved community.\" 286Accordingly,
neoliberalism renders law \"as a condition for the preservation (and
optimization)\" of the free market. 287In other words, under the
political rationality of neoliberalism, the law\'s job is merely to
interpret the fairness of economic free enterprise, not to question free
enterprise\'s legitimacy in a democratic state built upon principles of
liberty, equality, and fairness. [The [**conservative**, **neoliberal**
framing]{.mark} of **political econ**omy manifests [in]{.mark} the
[**virtues** of **liberal legalism**]{.mark}, which
**[emphasize]{.mark}**s **[procedural fairness]{.mark}**]{.underline},
individual rights, and precedential authority. The liberal principles
that guide how lawyers or judges interpret the morality of laws and
public policies are the same principles that can be inferred from prior
legal cases, statutes, or constitutional texts. Thus, a positive
morality - \"the morality evident in the culture, among the population,
or evidenced by its legal history\" - is embedded in legalism\'s
deference to the authority of existing moral principles in law,
[[marginalizing]{.mark} the [**possibility** for **critical**]{.mark}
**[moral inquiry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 288This perhaps explains why
corporate lawyers or compliance lawyers are not routinely expected to
question the justice of the laws that facilitate and sustain free
enterprise\'s legitimacy. Instead, such lawyers typically confine their
professional lawyering role to a neutral assessment of law\'s fairness
in light of the prevailing positive morality of society - a
positionality premised on the inherent justice of the rule of law. The
neoliberal framing of the political economy has also influenced the
modern research university and, consequently, the business purpose of
law school itself. The modern research university \"replicates
neoliberalism\'s pattern\" by encouraging \"corporatization,
managerialism, deprofessionalization, contingent labor, and
\"precaritization\'\" in the university setting. 289

For example, both public and private universities across the United
States are commonly structured as corporations with governing boards
that include members of the business community. While private-sector
corporate officers can help universities raise operating funds for
important academic and public programs, they can also \"encroach\[\]
upon faculty autonomy\" by wielding \"increasing \[\*52\] power over
curricula\" and shaping research priorities. 290The corporatization of
the university often motivates top administrators to \"see\[\]
themsel\[ves\] as responsible to investors and donors more than \... to
the constituency on campus, the academics and students.\" 291Influenced
by their corporate board members, universities may adopt governing
structures shaped by \"managerialism\" that engender hierarchy, instill
bureaucracy, hinder transparency, preclude accountability, increase
tuition expenses, saddle students with increased debt, and weaken
faculty governance. 292 Indeed, the increase in law school tuition has
reached crisis levels. 293According to Paul Campos, \"Private law school
tuition increased by a factor of four in real (inflation-adjusted) terms
between 1971 and 2011, while resident tuition at public law schools has
nearly quadrupled in real terms over the past two decades.\" 294Perhaps
as a result, law school debt has reached crisis levels too. When
Congress extended the federal Direct PLUS Loan program in 2006 to allow
students to borrow the full amount of their tuition, many law schools
began to increase their tuition rates. According to the New York Times,
\"In 2012, the average law graduate\'s debt was \$ 140,000, 59 percent
higher than eight years earlier.\" 295As tuition rates soar and law firm
salaries stagnate, the result has been declining interest in law school,
especially among students from marginalized populations. 296With the
average law school graduate debt now hovering at \$ 160,000, it is no
surprise that \"fewer than 1-in-4 new law school graduates say their
legal education was worth the financial cost.\" 297Further, the burden
of student loan debt is not evenly distributed across racial groups,
reflecting \[\*53\] underlying wealth disparities. For example, \"Black
or African American law school graduates loan debts are 97% higher on
average than White law school graduates.\" 298 Worse still, the teaching
of specialized knowledge in higher education has become
de-professionalized, encouraging experimental models of teaching - e.g.,
internet-based learning with pre-recorded modules. 299Such models may
reduce university-wide costs and foster innovation, but they also might
narrow the role of tenured and tenure-track faculty in teaching. This
narrowing of faculty roles can negatively affect the development of
legal pedagogy as course development becomes outsourced and
standardized. Contingent labor, such as adjunct faculty, has reduced
university costs, but has also weakened faculty governance due to
constant turnovers. It can also undermine the collegial atmosphere of
academic institutions when adjunct professors are physically distant.
According to a statement prepared by the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP), \"Student learning is diminished by
reduced contact with tenured faculty members, whose expertise in their
field and effectiveness as teachers have been validated by peer review,
and to whom the institution has made a long-term commitment.\"
300Further, contingent labor can instill insecurity among core faculty
members who either fear that they will lose their job, or fear that they
will lose their primary role in the educational experience of their
students. 301

[**[Neolib]{.mark}**eralism**[\'s greatest impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[surfaces in]{.mark} the]{.underline} law [classroom itself,
where]{.underline} law [[students]{.mark} are **acculturated** into
the]{.underline} legal [**profession** by way]{.underline} of liberal

law\'s **[[morality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Instead, they may assume the
inherent justice of the law, and thus, may experience a sense of
disorientation when their learning experience contradicts their lived
experience. While cultural stereotypes and limiting beliefs may distort
\[\*54\] notions of fairness in law, 302the ideals of liberal legalism
routinely frame how law students ask questions and where they seek
answers. As rising market demand for practice-ready lawyers amplifies a
focus on bar exam preparation and practical lawyering skills training in
the core curriculum, debate on the law\'s relationship to liberty,
equality, and democracy have become largely elective experiences for
self-selecting students. As a result, law [[students are]{.mark}

matters worse, faced with the challenge of finding a well-paying job
after graduation to pay exorbitant student loans, 304law students are
often pressured to take jobs at high-paying firms, rather than pursue
the nonprofit jobs that inspired many of them to go to law school. 305
It is doubtful that many law schools will admit that they feed into this
reality. To be sure, some law schools explicitly seek applicants who
convey an appreciation for the moral dimensions of lawyering in their
admissions essays, and even reward those who commit to social justice
with merit-based scholarships. 306Yet, in many law schools, law students
are inevitably taught that \"thinking like a lawyer\" entails analyzing
hypothetical facts and abstract legal principles through the eyes of an
objective and faceless \"reasonable\" person, not through the eyes of a
marginalized or oppressed individual. Further, courts have neutralized
legal analysis with appeals to \"colorblindness\" in judicial opinions,
presumably due to a conviction that race and ethnicity should not matter
in a neutral and unbiased legal system. 307As Chief Justice John Roberts
put it, \"The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop
discriminating on the basis of race.\" 308 \[\*55\] Thus, even for law
students interested in the moral dimensions of their professional
lawyering identity, learning how to embody public citizenship across
diverse cultural paradigms may take a back seat to fulfilling
market-based expectations of practice-readiness that sustain law
school\'s institutional legitimacy. Duncan Kennedy famously argued that
such expectations can reproduce social and class stratification in law
school, furthering hierarchy in America more generally. 309According to
Kennedy, students \"learn to suffer with positive cheerfulness
interruption in mid-sentence, mockery, ad hominem assault \... abrupt
dismissal, and stinginess of praise.\" 310This silencing is not only
disorienting for law students; it is disempowering, 311especially for
those students who identify with marginalized populations. 312 To be
sure, many law schools have begun to integrate diversity, equity, and
inclusion initiatives and experiential learning programs that directly
engage social movements and explore the role of law in advancing racial
and economic justice. 313Yet, these programs do not exist at every U.S.
law school. As a result, in many cases, law students come to view the
public purpose of law school as optional - an elective path in law
practice that need not become a dominant part of one\'s professional
lawyering identity beyond the minimum hourly commitment of pro bono
services required for graduation from law school, 314 \[\*56\] and in
rare cases, required for admission to the bar. 315If law schools embrace
the public citizenship imperative in the preamble to the model rules of
professional conduct, diversity initiatives and experiential learning
programs must transcend market-based notions of practice-readiness.
Specifically, [[they must **shift beyond**]{.mark} the **[formalistic
skills training]{.mark}**]{.underline} orientation that too often
governs modern legal education. 316

III\. BEYOND LIBERAL LEGALISM IN LEGAL EDUCATION Notions of lawyering
practice-readiness within the legal academy remain mixed. While some law
schools prioritize training in the practical lawyering skills in demand
at top law firms, others emphasize experiential learning opportunities
that develop critical perspectives on professional lawyering identity.
Further, while some law faculty maintain a conservative approach toward
law teaching by prioritizing the subject matter tested on state bar
exams, others allow their pedagogy to be molded by progressive movements
in legal theory and lawyering practice. This Section argues that law
schools\' intent on amplifying the public purpose of law school in their
pedagogy and praxis must embrace both a critical theoretical and
movement lawyering posture toward the doctrinal and clinical stance.
More specifically, the reformed law school curriculum must guide
students through a theoretical and experiential deconstruction of law
and lawyering practice. 317Such an approach will help guide law students
from disorientation toward critical legal consciousness of the moral
dimensions of their vocation. Part III.A discusses how critical theories
of law have challenged the fundamental assumptions of liberal legalism,
uncovering the political and socio-cultural dimensions of law that call
into question its legitimacy and determinacy. \[\*57\] Part III.B
explores movement lawyering as a reconstructive vision of liberal
legalism that challenges conventional modes of lawyering practice. Both
critical legal theories of law and movement law share two fundamental
aims in U.S. law practice: (1) achieving political legitimacy,
notwithstanding law\'s historic role in the sociopolitical construction
of systemic domination and hierarchy; 318and (2) striving for justice,
where the lawyer serves as a public citizen aspiring to dismantle
vestiges of racial and economic oppression embedded in the law.
Collectively, these insights point toward the need for a reformed legal
pedagogy that will guide the strivings of law students toward new
visions of American democracy. Both Part III.A and III.B end with a few
examples of current law school efforts to address these challenges. A.
Critical Theory as Reclamation In 1989, Mari Matsuda coined the term
\"outsider jurisprudence\" to describe the insights and interventions of
legal scholars who drew inspiration from, and advocated on behalf of,
persons traditionally excluded from jurisprudential discourse.
319Building upon the work of Matsuda and others, Francisco Valdes
popularized the phrase \"critical outsider jurisprudence\" in the late
1990s to describe the various critical theoretical movements that had
emerged in legal academia across time - i.e., critical legal studies,
critical race theory, feminist legal theory, Latina and Latino critical
legal theory (LatCrit theory), and queer legal theory, among others -
each seeking, fundamentally, to advance the well-being of \"outgroups in
the United States and globally.\" 320According to Valdes, [[the
**critical outsider**]{.mark} **positionality [reflects]{.mark}** [an
effort]{.mark} to \"**interject**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
**[substantive terms]{.underline}** [the needs, interests, and concerns
of \... traditionally subordinated groups]{.underline} \... to overcome,
in part through legal reform, the conditions of historical and
contemporary subordination.\" 321 These efforts point toward a broader
critique advanced by critical educational theorists, more generally,
about the **[dominant structure of education]{.underline}** \[\*58\] as
an instrumentality of colonialization and power. 322In order [[to
**teach students**]{.mark} how \"to **assimilate**]{.underline} [and
**domesticate**]{.underline} in the name of progress and prosperity,\"
such scholars argue, [formal education]{.underline} often omits \"the
systematic imposition of supremacist politics\" [[with a]{.mark}n
**ultimate [goal]{.mark}** [of \"keeping **each succeeding**
generation]{.mark}]{.underline} socially [**[tranquilized]{.mark}**,
culturally [subjugated, and]{.mark}]{.underline} politically
**[[subordinated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" 323In the context of U.S. law
schools, Valdes argued in 2003 that \"legal education historically was
structured to privilege White-identified groups, persons, and values\"
and \"to exclude feared or \"different\' Others.\" 324This explained, in
his view, \"why critical theory is still absent or marginal in formal
law school curricula,\" and why \"traditionalist identity politics is
alive, and rife\[,\] \... aimed to \"reclaim\' the national culture.\"
325Almost twenty years later, Valdes\'s point still resonates as
Americans witnessed former President Donald Trump pledge to \"make
America great again\" while sparking a political assault on the teaching
of critical race theory in schools nationwide, 326and provoking, many
argue, an insurrection upon the U.S. capitol to \"save America.\" 327

#### The pervasiveness of market ideology is rooted [not]{.underline} in its material merits but rather in a vision of order --- [discursive imaginaries]{.underline} overdetermine our valuing of competing economic systems.

We argue that [[the oversimplified vision of the market]{.mark} as
self-regulatory]{.underline} mechanism could be interpreted differently.
The market [[**cannot** be perceived as a remedy for every]{.mark}
social [problem]{.mark}]{.underline}; and in fact it wasn't, as the data
show: people clearly saw market mechanisms in the sphere of work as a
possible threat to their economic security. Rather, building on the
present analysis, we suggest that [[the appeal of the]{.mark}
free-[market]{.mark} model [lies in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[imaginaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** which have been summed up in
Table 1. The imaginaries [[of]{.mark} transparency, [**neutrality** and
**rationality**]{.mark}]{.underline} provide the transformation with
narrative of ascent (Frye, 1957) which speaks even to those whose
economic profits from the reforms are limited or negative. In this
narrative, the market reforms are not primarily portrayed as an escape
from shortage poverty but as an escape from the social oversaturation
and hassle of everyday life. It was therefore driven not so much by
preference towards market itself, but towards the imaginary of
neutrality and rationality free from arbitrariness. In this narrative,
[[the]{.mark} free [market]{.mark}]{.underline} was seen [as an
impersonal self-regulatory mechanism]{.underline}, an exact opposite of
the command economy planning.

The public was generally aware that [[market reforms would mean
a]{.underline}]{.mark} temporary [[**drop** in the standards of
living]{.underline}]{.mark}. Still, they were [perceived as
necessary]{.underline}, which could have [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} lot to
do with [[vision of]{.mark} self**-[regulatory
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} that would appear only if the market
mechanisms could operate. This order, in consequence, [would [eliminate
arbitrary decisions from]{.mark} most mundane
[spheres]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[make]{.mark} the **[rules]{.mark} of daily life** [more
transparent]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and to certain extent it in fact
did, as introduction of market mechanisms allowed a better distribution
and supply of goods (that they were to become more expensive and less
available is quite another thing). The public perceived changes as
necessary even if they meant more economic insecurity not necessarily
because it was 'seduced' by the elitist discourse of economic experts.
Rather, the willingness to endure economic hardships of market reforms
could be supported by the actual experiences of nuisance from daily life
under real socialism, firmly rooted in the structural traits of the
system.

// K Nahm

[Removing]{.underline} anarchist [[utopianism]{.underline}]{.mark} from
the binominal taxonomies that distinguish historical, workerist,
ideological anarchism [from contemporary anti-ideological horizontalism
[reveals]{.mark} the existence of [a spectrum of]{.mark}]{.underline}
utopian, **[prefigurative [practices]{.mark}]{.underline}** and suggests
a number of distinct political uses [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} utopia in
[contemporary [activism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Utopias might be fleshed
out]{.underline} sociologically at one end of this spectrum [and appear
[as]{.mark} nebulous possibilities, [vehicles for the **principle of
desire**]{.mark}, at the other]{.underline}. [The danger of]{.underline}
invoking a harsher historicized transformation of anarchist utopianism,
crystallized in the concept of [prefiguration]{.underline}, [is that a
particular set of approaches to social change are valued at the cost of
others.]{.underline} Recognizing the spectrum on which anarchist
utopianism rests admits a diversity of prefigurative practices.

Contemporary literature shows that [utopianism supports diversity in
activism]{.underline}. Among the prefigurative practices that contain
strongly sociological currents are a number of grass-roots community
projects. Shaun Chamberlain, for example, describes the "force for a
better future" in a project of community building, fostering a
collective psychology of hopefulness. In a discussion of the Transition
movement he argues, "[if despair is perceiving an undesirable future as
inevitable, [one glimpse of a]{.mark}]{.underline} realistic, welcome
[[alternative transforms our despondency into a]{.underline}]{.mark}
massive **[[drive to work towards that
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}**."\[40\] In a similar spirit, Mark
Smith advocates a form of practical utopianism that models ecological
ways of living through the estimation of global risk.\[41\] There is at
least a hint of Proudhon and Kropotkin in these approaches and a
resounding echo in Franco "Bifo" Berardi's conception of utopian
possibility:

As Force and Reaon have failed as principles of social change and
political government, I think that we should adopt the point of view of
the tendency, not the point of view of the will. Tendency is not an
ideal, a utopia, it is not the projection of a rational order that force
would eventually implement. Tendency is a possibility implicated in the
present state of things, a possibility that cannot currently be deployed
because the present paradigm of social relations \... makes such
deployment impossible.\[42\]

[[Utopias that prioritise]{.underline}]{.mark} psychologies of
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[revolve around the creation of
**autonomous space** and]{.mark} the [transformation of **every-day
social relationships**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Dreams and
visions]{.underline} still [have a place in]{.underline} these strands
of [prefigurative practice]{.underline}. Ben Lear and Ralph Schlembach's
recent discussion of [hope]{.underline} and despair
[includes]{.underline} a central demand, "[luxury for]{.underline} all",
which is reminiscent of William Morris's call for wealth and the
abandonment of riches. [[Utopia provides a way of moving
beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} the despair that
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} induces [[by providing]{.mark}
a]{.underline} "[basis of our]{.underline}
**[[hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not in capitalist development, but
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
eventual abolishment". Their anti-utopian utopianism bears some other
hallmarks of his utopian romance.

Our [hope is non-utopian in the sense that [we are not in the business
of painting **detailed pictures** of **what a post-capitalist society
will look like**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} That does not mean that we
cannot imagine or experiment with social relationships that are not
dominated by the logic of accumulation and valorisation \... [[What
we]{.underline}]{.mark} do [[say when we talk about an **alternative is
that we reject the logic of capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The vision
of a post-capitalist world is not one of paradise; \...we can, and must
imagine a future where the production of wealth is no longer tied to
class divisions and the labour relation.\[43\]

Nevertheless, [a striking [trend in]{.mark}]{.underline} prefigurative
[[politics is towards **dystopian escape**, rather than **utopian
achievement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Lear and Schlembach's conclusion is
that indignation can powerfully be brought bear on change and that the
"[[**unwillingness to imagine** bigger political
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[contributes to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the "sense of [[despair]{.mark} and rage]{.underline}" that activists
feel. In other activist writing, the idea is taken a step further.
Utopia captures a boundless politics, but one described negatively as
desire to resist, reject or destroy. Mark Fisher evokes an idea of
perpetual motion, rooted in a psychological drive against death: statis.
"[As desiring creatures]{.underline}" Fisher notes "**[[we ourselves are
that which disrupts organic equilibrium]{.underline}]{.mark}**", or the
tendency towards regulation, direction and control.\[44\]

Paul Goodman's discussion of utopianism offers a useful way of thinking
about this recasting of prefigurative politics. In a discussion of grief
and anger Goodman linked utopianism to patience. Patience, he argued,
did not mean calm. On the contrary, utopianism was also a trigger for
violent passions: anger, about the obstacles to the realization of
utopian desire and grief, for things understood to be absent through the
identification of that desire. Utopians were patient in the sense that
they were prepared to wait for the emergence of felt desire, through
their anger and grief. This meant that [[utopian desire always had an
object and]{.mark} it involved [effort]{.mark} in the present in order
[to secure it]{.mark}s attainment]{.underline} -- Goodman's anticipation
of prefiguration. In contemporary activism, the positive value attached
to the ability to tap negative passions -- despair, indignation, hatred
and particularly rage -- does not suggest that utopian patience has been
eclipsed. But their invocation suggests a narrowing of contemporary
anarchist utopianism and in the notion of prefigurative practices open
to activists. John Holloway's discussion of anti-capitalist rage
captures the mood. His concern is to channel the forces of destruction
rather than confront their negativity:

Break the windows of the banks, shoot the politicians, kill the rich,
hang the bankers from the lampposts. Certainly, all that is very
understandable, but it does not help very much. [It is money we must
kill, not its servants. And [the only way to kill money is to create
**different social cohesions**]{.mark}, different ways of coming
together, different ways of doing things.]{.underline} Kill money, kill
labour. Here, now.\[45\]

This most negative casting of means-end relationship remains
prefigurative and is perhaps reminiscent of Bakunin's famous declaration
that the passion for destruction is a creative passion, too. The
difference is that the righteous expression of rage, indignation or
despair often appears in contemporary literature as a condition of being
rather than of doing. Moreover, it depends on the conjuring of
powerfully dystopian images of existing society, which variously
ensnares, entraps and enslaves individuals. In the light of this
dystopian imagery, the generalized emotions which radicals seek to
release increasingly resemble those that Paul Goodman cautioned against
when he contrasted desire "without its object" and the adoption of "the
role of being angry", to the desire for something and the ability to
blaze against the obstacles to its achievement. [The [ends of change
are]{.mark} not only described with deliberate **[vague]{.mark}ness**,
even when linked to practical activities, [but]{.mark} the [**analysis
of means** is developed as **pulling away**, less a pushing
toward]{.mark}]{.underline}. Goodman explained the enraging
[desire]{.underline} to desire as a sense of lost paradise or the idea
of "paradise not yet", but rather than endorsing this idea [as an
impulse to **eternal struggle**]{.underline}, as Abensour suggests, he
rejected it as a cause of continuous frustration.\[46\] The negatively
and [dystopianism]{.underline} of contemporary prefiguration changes the
focus for action, tends against the specification of hopes and desires
and undercuts the positive charge that Bakunin excludes in his
destructiveness. [The **[power of]{.mark} this
[imagery]{.mark}**]{.underline} might well help [[facilitate common
actions]{.mark}, masses, occupations and demonstrations]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[new]{.underline}]{.mark} types of
[[social cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark} that Holloway advocates, even
whilst the ends and means of protest are defined in a variety of
different ways. Yet it is [difficult to accommodate]{.underline} the
[horizontal practices]{.underline} and behaviours expressed through
mutual aid in protest organizations and community campaigns
[in]{.underline} these [[dystopian frameworks]{.mark}, for they seem to
[exist **"outside" the real world** in a manner that makes their
operation appear]{.mark}]{.underline} partial or
[[compromised]{.underline}]{.mark} or impossible. Linked to a more
positively [[utopian]{.underline}]{.mark} politics, this kind of
[[activity]{.underline}]{.mark} might support a variety of ends and
means and might even remain indeterminate, but in any of its forms, it
would be [[possible for]{.mark} everyone]{.underline} -- **[[participant
and observer]{.underline}]{.mark}**, friend and enemy alike -- [[to
appreciate]{.mark} the [complex]{.mark} ways in which [actions]{.mark}
might be designed [to **prefigure utopian goals**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Looking again at anarchist history helps uncover some political uses of
utopia that might contribute to such an approach.

Some readers may suggest that these emotionally charged narratives echo
the familiar phenomenon of post-socialist nostalgia that has been
observed across the very different post-1989/1991 contexts and that had
usually served as a way of criticising the present through the past. In
such accounts, the meaning of [nosetalgia]{.underline} generally
[connotes a **depoliticised narrative** of]{.underline} previous
[stability and security that]{.underline} individuals find virtually
non-existent in their present and through the memories of which they
[negotiate]{.underline} their own [adaptability to a disqualified but
**alternativeness capitalist present**]{.underline}. Klumbyte (2008) and
Satybaldieva (2017) add another nuance by arguing that [[nostalgia
reflects]{.mark} first and foremost [a project of **normative
positioning** of the self]{.mark} in a way [that reasserts the past as
**meaningful**]{.mark} and still valid model of human
flourishing]{.underline}. Kurtović and Sargsyan (2019) take this further
by exploring the reflexive ways through which [[the]{.mark} **mundane**
nostalgia for]{.underline} the forms of '[[good
life']{.underline}]{.mark} that socialism afforded [[can serve as
repertoires for]{.mark} the advancement of **[emancipatory
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} in ways that do not legitimise socialism
as a political system.

Although my interlocutors used [nostalgic reasoning in criticising the
present]{.underline}, the forms that their engagement with the past took
went in a slightly different direction, advancing the above-mentioned
interpretations in important ways. When voicing discontent with their
current situation, migrants did not negate certain aspects of capitalism
and affirmed others. Rather, they [put forward a diagnosis of a
political system that was irreparably unable to enhance individual
well-being and collective progress]{.underline}. In this sense, [the
real capitalist system]{.underline} under which they lived in the
post-socialist era was [not]{.underline} seen as
[progress]{.underline}ing [to its 'normal' form]{.underline} and as such
no [longer necessitated 'adjustment' efforts as part of a meaningful
strategy]{.underline}. [[Narrating the]{.mark} [past]{.mark} and
positing it as the '**norm'** [stem]{.mark}med [not from the
'**impossibility of restoration'**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}Todorova & Gille, 2010) [of]{.underline} (state)
[socialism]{.underline}, [[nor the inevitability of the free
market]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} rather [[from]{.mark}
sustained belief in [the **world-making potential** of the former
and]{.mark} the [**broken hope** in the]{.mark}]{.underline} promises of
the [[latter]{.underline}]{.mark}. While nostalgia involves regret,
despair and loss, it was the general atmosphere of irreconcilability and
determination that framed my conversations in(-between) Bulgaria and the
UK.

To capture what happens after nostalgia, or how nostalgia can harness
the longings for the past and the grievances of the present in a
conscious albeit quotidian work of the political, I return to
[the]{.underline} Castoriadian [notion of the '**[radical
imaginary']{.mark}**]{.underline}. As opposed to nostalgia, the
imaginary [is [always]{.mark} forward-looking and
transformative]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} [it]{.underline}s heart
[is the autonomous capacity to **[rupture]{.mark} and re-create** rather
than adapt and maintain [the existing order]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
Castoriadis (1994), the [emancipatory undertones of the imaginary are
[ultimately **instantiated in praxis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which he
relates to conscious activity that brings tectonic shifts in the social
and political organisation of reality. Still, he
[[allow]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[for the 'radical' to emerge in]{.mark}
less sweeping and spectacular ruptures that can still retain a
**[world-changing potentiality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I have tried to
uncover [the wider purchase of the imaginary in the material
realm]{.underline} of labour migration, as a routinised praxis that
organises the social reproduction of 'ordinary' individuals and that
from a vehicle of hope had come to serve as vehicle for voicing failure
and despair. [Structured under]{.underline} the conditions of punishing
[labour regimes and regulatory frames]{.underline}, [[for
contemporary]{.underline}]{.mark} moving
[[subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}, migration had become a catalyst for
[unleashing the potentiality of imagination]{.underline}, in a way that
[threaten]{.underline}ed [the conditions that produced its own
structural raison d'être]{.underline}. Thus, somehow paradoxically,
[[when]{.mark} individual ambitions are]{.underline} largely [given up
and collective [visions of betterment
**exhausted**]{.mark},]{.underline} migration can turn into [[an
empowering reality]{.underline}]{.mark} [empty]{.underline}ing [out the
present from mystical ideological notions and [resurrecting]{.mark} with
[new]{.mark} confidence [imaginaries]{.mark} that [hold **subversive
possibilities**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Post-socialist Bulgaria and present-day Britain served as metonymic
'frames of reference' through which people talked about their
frustration with the general capitalist context and launched alternative
articulations of redistribution, freedom and justice. [The
[normalisation of socialism as an **experiential reality**]{.mark} and
as a 'system' built on much missed values such as solidarity, social
justice and freedom of need made capitalist]{.underline} Britain (and
Bulgaria) appear as obsolete, inhumane and predatory,
[societies]{.underline} which were [cynical to the 'true' meaning
of]{.underline} the self and [social relations and]{.underline} could
absorb [all fundamental virtues]{.underline} and basic ethics into its
omnivorous economic rationality. It can be argued that the
[despondency]{.underline} produced by experiences of economic hardship
and alienation was [directed towards the [reject]{.mark}ion
of]{.underline} the ideological hegemony of [[neoliberalism and]{.mark}
the imagining of a better model of [social
organisation]{.mark}]{.underline} in which not meritocracy but equality
[emerges as the 'correct']{.underline} and moral [way for strucuring
individual behaviour]{.underline} and achievement.

Traykov (2020) shows how the neoliberalising reforms in Bulgaria, highly
unpopu- lar for the majority, were successfully enforced through the
ideological smokescreen of anti-communism and its multi-faceted
development as a legal-institutional, edu- cational and
cultural-intellectual ideological apparatus. Largely interpreted within
totalitarian and repressive frameworks, the socialist past lost its
historical and social complexity and was reduced to 'anathema'
(Lampland, 2002: 32), the legacies and achievements of which had to be
deligitimised and subjected to collective misrecogni- tion. Efforts were
directed towards the building of new interpretative schema in which
voices for workers' rights, economic equality and social justice were
treated as relics of the past and dangerously counterproductive to the
process of 'democratisation' (Traykov, 2020). The imaginary visions
presented here demonstrate that working-class people, at least some of
those who have been forced into survival through migration, continue (or
revert back) to stand up for left-leaning and anti-capitalist values
that resonate better with their daily struggles and with their hope for
future possibilities. For some, it was a matter of re-creating a system
around some of the lost understandings of self-worth, work and the state
that the legacy of socialism stood for; for others, the imaginary was
carried in a clear restorative discourse that sought to de-throne
capital- ism and re-instate socialism as a political system and a
modernisation project. And this is hardly surprising if we consider the
fact that poverty rates in the country continue to surpass their
pre-1989 levels (Ghodsee & Orenstein, 2021). Since 2016 Bulgaria heads
the rank of income inequality in the EU (Gini coefficient 40) (Eurostat,
2022) and support for free markets plummeted from 73 per cents in 1991
to 55 in 2019 (Pew Research Center, 2009). Recent study reveals that 58%
of the population consider their life worst off or the same as that of
the previous generation (Gallup International, 2023), and when asked how
they evaluate state socialism in 2017, 44% replied that at that period
the country was on the right path of development, while 41% would have
chosen to still live in socialist Bulgaria (Trend, 2017).

For Castoriadis (1994), [the given meaning of [the social world
is]{.mark} always [to be struggled over]{.mark} and a field]{.underline}
which is [established on the fragile balance between the significations
of the normative order and the acts of self-institution that re-draw
**[the contours of the possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [openings
for]{.underline} the [[articulation of]{.mark} the [radical imaginary
are contained in]{.mark} the ruptures between]{.underline} the scripts
of the what is [[capitalist reality]{.underline}]{.mark} and
working-class praxis of migration, the [[materiality]{.mark} and
ideological conditions]{.underline} of which [[can no longer
be]{.underline}]{.mark} meaningfully [[incorporated into the
post-socialist **terrain of dissonance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a form

My work seeks to build on these insights by bridging them with
geographic literature on commoditization (e.g., Heynen et al.
Citation2007, Prudham Citation2007), through the framework of Historical
Political Ecology, as mentioned before. Like Cameron and Cruikshank, I
attempt to do this by [foregrounding [historical
depth]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark} step [[because past modes of
power]{.mark} and meaning-making [constrain]{.mark} **imaginative
[possibilities]{.mark}** [in the present and because]{.mark} historical
[narrative]{.mark} itself [is a **site of
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nonrepresentational theory\'s
[insistence on highlighting]{.mark}]{.underline} people and [things in
[performative action]{.mark} [rather than
theorizing]{.mark}]{.underline} actual [[representations]{.mark} runs
the risk]{.underline} (depending on how any individual researcher uses
it) [of [neglect]{.mark}ing [how actions are shaped by]{.mark} **past
[rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark} [and]{.mark} "[history-making]{.mark}
practices**"]{.underline} (Peluso Citation2012, p. 80). As Law
(Citation2004, p. 5) puts it, "everything is constructed in a specific
historical context and [there can be no escape from
history]{.underline}." Independently from my focus group research, I
have argued (Schlosser Citation2013a) that Canadian diamonds as
[[ethical alternatives are **only intelligible** within a system
of]{.underline}]{.mark} historically accumulated [[symbolic
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}, akin to Bourdieu\'s (Citation1984) concept
of habitus, linked to discourses of a "dark" African continent and a
liberal, multicultural Canadian polity. Part of [the point of a
[representational focus]{.mark} is to [show how]{.mark} those
representations are enabled, constrained, and products of **previous
acts** of representation]{.underline}---[how they have]{.underline}, in
fact, [not escaped history]{.underline}. They are not extemporaneous
performances. Historical **[[narrative is crucial to social
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If one accepts that as a basic theoretical
presupposition, then methods which flow from that ought to involve
indigenous people offering perspective and insight into that narrative
(or counternarrative).

My vehicle for this happens to be Historical Political Ecology, which
integrates political ecology\'s recognition of the multiscalar forces
that impinge upon and enable land use decisions with the important
insights of Environmental History (Hornborg Citation2007). Historical
Political Ecology is defined by Offen (Citation2004, p. 21) as "a
field-informed interpretation of society-nature relations in the past
... how and why those relations have changed (or not changed) over time
and space, and the significance of those interpretations for improving
social justice and nature conservation today." Historical Political
Ecology is still "one of the least visible of the widely recognized
research areas within political ecology" (Davis Citation2009, p. 285) in
part because while the importance of historical context to political
ecology work is often asserted, the precise nature of the link between
historical context and contemporary social justice issues is often left
vague and unexamined. My use of focus groups, wherein respondents
interpret and discuss Canadian diamond advertisements, was intended to
make my analysis of representation, commoditization, and global capital
flows more field informed, per Offen\'s definition.

For example, a group of young Inuit, in their late teens and early
twenties, were shown the following copy from an advertisement for "Maple
Leaf Diamonds." Their response exemplifies how and why the perspective
of indigenous community members, rather than being data to which value
is later added, actually adds value to a geographic analysis---it helps
show, at the level of theory, what questions need to be asked.

### Framework\-\--AT: Plan Focus\-\--2NC

#### Focusing on [theoretical underpinnings]{.underline} is [more important]{.underline} than policy detail.

**Huber '16** \[Matt; October 2016; Assistant Professor of Geography at

Climate change is a public crisis. It is a crisis of public health. It
is a crisis of the public commons, the atmosphere, the climate system,
and the coastlines. As Christian Parenti has argued, [a **public
[crisis]{.mark}** [requires **public rather** than **market**]{.mark}
solution**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is historical precedent for
this.

In the 1930s, FDR enacted a massive nationwide energy plan based on the
public construction of dams and the provision of electricity to rural
areas in need. While we recognize the ecological problems of this
project in hindsight, it is nevertheless an example of an energy project
that is framed not in terms of costs, but in terms of bringing energy to
people.

[The [**political point** was made not by **quibbling** over
**complicated policy structures**]{.mark}, but through **appeals** to
what people **actually needed**]{.underline}---affordable, reliable
energy. Woody Guthrie, for example, was commissioned to sing songs about
the Columbia River doing work "for you and me" by providing
hydroelectric energy to the masses.

[The cost of wind and solar power are now dropping precipitously. But it
will take **[state power]{.mark}** and **public investment** to build
the **infrastructure** of a renewable-energy economy]{.underline}. Such
projects should be promoted as ways of bringing cheaper and
inexhaustible energy from the sun and wind to economically struggling
working people, and creating good jobs doing socially useful work.
[[Just as our **modern fossil-fuel infrastructure**]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- highways, dams, rural electrification --- [[was a **product**
of]{.mark} **public works** and **state investment**, [so should the
**green energy econ**]{.mark}omy [be]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[In order [for this **vision** to become
**reality**]{.mark}]{.underline} however, [[we **need** to **change**
the **language** of **climate politics**]{.mark}. Climate change is
**not** an **exceptional market failure** that can be **corrected** by
getting the prices right. Capitalist markets are simply **not wired** to
meet **social** and **ecological** needs --- they will always "**fail**"
in this regard. [We **cannot cede** our **future** to a game of **market
competition**]{.mark} by simply **hoping** renewables will overtake
fossil fuels in the market. Collective action and
**[public]{.mark}-oriented [solutions]{.mark}** [are our **only hope**
for survival]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Framework\-\--Education\-\--Ext

#### Debating about [alternatives]{.underline} to [capitalism]{.underline} is [pedagogically valuable]{.underline}.

It is no coincidence that periods of crisis and turbulence, as Ariel
Colonomos says, tend to be those when "ideas about the future are most
highly sought after and could have the **[most impact on
reality]{.underline}**, when the course of history seems to oscillate
between various possible worlds."1 It is not hard to see why this is the
case: [[reflection on **possible futures**]{.underline}]{.mark} is an
[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}, inescapable [[dimension
of]{.underline}]{.mark} individual and collective
[[agency]{.underline}]{.mark}--- particularly in times of crisis when
temporal horizons are compressed, the urgency of decision arises, and we
must grapple with the possible futures that may result from our
decisions.

The concern for futures has (unfortunately) had less impact on the
social sciences. Yet it is possible to identify a minor tradition of
research and speculative imagination called "**[futures
studies]{.underline}**," defined by Wendell Bell as "a
transdisciplinary, unifying social science" that aims "to discover or
invent, [examine and evaluate, and propose possible, probable, and
preferable futures]{.underline}."2 Far from detached observations of the
historical process, exercises in futures studies---as Silke Beck and
Martin Mahony argue---are inherently political: **[[future
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}** ["do not just represent possible
futures, but also [help]{.mark} to [bring certain futures into
being]{.mark}]{.underline}," for instance, by shaping the
cognitive-affective dispositions of political actors; constraining or
widening the range of imagined possible futures; motivating efforts to
ward off futures perceived as undesirable; and/or
**[[inspiring]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[new activist,
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}, or [[investment
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to bring **desired futures** into

#### Anticapitalist education is good.

samar

For Daniel, it is not a question of students swearing their allegiance
to Karl Marx. Teaching anti-capitalism is not about blunt indoctrination
or straightforward information transfer. (This wouldn't work anyway, as
students are critical beings just like their teachers.) No: What Daniel
advocates for instead is an alternative pedagogy---[a **teaching**
structure **opposing** the **capitalistic logic** that society should be
organized around profit-seeking, consumption-addled
individuality]{.underline}. This form of teaching [offers a **socialized
approach**]{.underline} to interrogating things like debt, employment,
and the digital platforms in which all writing is now entangled. It
designates the writing classroom as a place for people to think
together, in which their "collective labor \[is\] organized as the
critique of capitalism, rather than its fulfillment."

Writes Daniel: "[**\[A\]nticapitalist action** \[is\] a site of vital
**togetherness**]{.underline}." Of this, he contends, [the classroom can
be a primary]{.underline} instance---a [**site** of
**resistance**]{.underline} against the isolating, competitive logic of
capitalism. There, [students might work **together** to build
**knowledge** and communicative **capacity** independent of
profit]{.underline}, cutthroat [anxiety]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
selfish [pleasure]{.underline}. Hidden inside the mass of the
contemporary techno-imperial university is something precious and
profoundly worth preserving.

Students know that the world is in crisis. [They **stare** at
misery-producing **screens** and **recognize** that the **planet** is
**cooked**]{.underline} for the benefit of an obscene minority; they
lived through a pandemic. Many already sense that, as Daniel (following
a mass of scholarship) puts it, "[capitalism plays a crucial role in
deepening and sustaining virtually all other crises and
inequities]{.underline}"---even if they haven't yet read Ruth Wilson
Gilmore, Angela Davis, Walter Rodney, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Robin D.
G. Kelley, or Cedric Robinson, scholars who have demonstrated how
capitalism supercharges racism, misogyny, queerphobia, state violence,
and ecological disaster.

The feeling is there. [**Students** just need a **critical language**
for it]{.underline}---[an anti-capitalist one that composition
classrooms can **nourish** at the level of both **pedagogical form** and
thematic **content**]{.underline}. This need is, in turn, linked to
campus labor struggles and the battle for a democratic university, which
is happening right now in places like Florida (where Governor Ron
DeSantis's henchmen continue to dismantle the state's public schools)
and West Virginia, the site of E. Gordon Gee's wrecking campaign.

For Daniel, a lively classroom models a larger "democratization of the
university." This is risky pedagogy: many higher education institutions
run firmly on what Henry Heller, in The Capitalist University: The
Transformations of Higher Education in the United States Since 1945
(2016), calls "academic capitalism": [a **corporate model** where
powerful **managers control** all planning]{.underline}, where labor is
crushed, [and where students are loaded down with debt]{.underline} by
design. Many Americans would be surprised to learn that leftist
professors don't wield much power in academia. The real heavyweights are
what Daniel calls "the vast body of typically conservative financial
stakeholders including donors, trustees, partner universities, foreign
nations, and corporations." Rather than top-down bureaucracies devoted
to capital extraction and prestige accumulation, Daniel contends for "a
more collective space where those who are coactive in the operation of
the university and the production and dissemination of knowledge are
substantively involved in the governance of the institution." [Within
**classrooms** themselves]{.underline}, he advocates for [composition
**seminars**]{.underline}---[a common **ground** for **subjectivities**
that don't flatten students' and instructors' **individual
differences**]{.underline}, spaces where intellectual work is
intrinsically worthwhile and collaborative.

### Framework\-\--Fiat K\-\--2NC

#### Debates about [legal consequences]{.underline} are 'false consciousness' that [alienate]{.underline} us from our labor. 

**Herrine '20** \[Luke; Assistant Professor of Law at the University of
Alabama and former Managing Editor of the LPE Blog; "A Tribute to David
Graeber."; LPE Project; 14 Sept. 2020;
lpeproject.org/blog/david-graeber-tribute/.\]//neev

The piece I link there is called ["Fetishism as Social
Creativity"]{.underline}. In it, Graeber draws from anthropological and
philological research on the origins of the term "fetish" to explore the
**[[paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}** of social creativity: that
"[[human]{.underline}]{.mark} beings do create new social and [[cultural
forms]{.underline}]{.mark} all the time" but that, when they do so, it
is nearly **[[always to serve goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** that have
"come to be [[formed through]{.underline}]{.mark} the very
[[institutions they]{.underline}]{.mark} \[and [previous generations of
humans]{.underline}\] [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}".

What does the former have to do with the latter? Well, "fetish" is a
term that can be traced to one of the most important moments in the
creation of the modern world: early European encounters with the people
on the Gold Coast of Africa. Portuguese merchants encountered the
practice, common to several communities on the Guinean coast of Africa,
of initiating a social relationship---a marriage, a truce, a business
deal---by swearing an oath and invoking the power of some trinket to
inflict punishment should the oath be broken. Traders participated in
this tradition, labeling it and the objects it employed with the
Portuguese word feitiço. In the pidgin that developed in that polyglot
space, fetisso (then, once the Dutch got
involved, fetiche, fetich, fattish, and other iterations towards fetish)
became a shared word and cultural form.

Accounts of these practices captured the imagination of many
philosophers back on the European mainland by way of bestselling
travelogues. In the eighteenth century, African "fetishism" came to be
interpreted as worshipping whatever happened to be nearby, and
"fetishism" more generally became a term for superstitious beliefs in
the power of material objects. Early theorists of religion, inevitably
placing Christianity at the top of their hierarchy, treated "fetishism"
as a primitive form of pre-religiosity the practitioners of which failed
to distinguish the spiritual from the material domain.

Yet once centuries of exoticization are dusted off, the African
practices of "fetish" should look familiar and should have looked
familiar to the Europeans confronting them. Rituals, including rituals
that attach deep moral and spiritual significance to material objects,
precede entry into marriages, truces, and alliances to this day. When
rituals precede entry into commercial agreements---e.g. a seal or a
signed writing or (more tenuously) bargained-for detriment---contract
scholarship calls them "formalities". (Not to mention wedding rings,
swearing on Bibles, etc.). Though we live in a largely disenchanted
world, many of us---including many atheistic moral philosophers---feel
that by breaking an agreement one has created a disturbance in the
not-quite-material moral universe that might come to haunt us in some
way we cannot quite explain.

Indeed, in Graeber's interpretation fetishism is an inevitable
characteristic of human cultures. It is "at root, our tendency to see
our own actions and creations as having power over us." The fetish
rituals on the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth and sixteenth
century did involve superstitions and mistaken cosmologies, but much of
their power---and the discomfort they caused among Europeans---derived
from their embodiment of the universal uncanniness inherent in the
binding feeling of social obligations that are the product of our own
hands. Fetishes "were both human creations and alien powers, at the same
time....The remarkable thing is how much, even when the actors seem
perfectly aware that they were constructing an illusion, they also
seemed aware that the illusion was still required."

Accordingly, the creation of the category of "fetish" and the
development of a whole theoretical tradition to demean it was a sort of
defense mechanism for Europeans to avoid confronting the uncanniness of
social creativity and the arbitrariness of their own practices. They did
not want to confront the possibility that the bindingness of
obligations, of social institutions, of law, could derive from their own
power rather than that of an all-seeing, all-knowing God.

What most disturbed Europeans about African "fetish" practices is what
Graeber thinks is most attractive about them: their "improvisational
quality"--using "whatever object happens to be lying around" to create a
binding obligation simultaneously acknowledges the necessity of feeling
that the bindingness of our social power must somehow come from
something other than ourselves and that it cannot come from anything
else. "A fetish is a god under process of construction." As Graeber
explains: "Fetishism is the point where...objects we have created or
appropriated for our own purposes suddenly come to be seen as powers
imposed on us, precisely at the moment where they come to embody some
newly created social bond."

Graeber's lesson is not that [[once we see]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[arbitrariness]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} we should come to realize that we
have no obligations to each other and disobey anything that do not fully
endorse in the moment. Rather, to borrow a trick from the Marxian
account of (commodity) fetishism: [[we should not become alienated from
our own]{.mark} (social) [labor]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
create/reproduce the social forms that shape our lives, and we can
recreate them in an infinite number of ways. But that does not mean
social forms do not have power over us. There is no way to create a
world without social forms that are somehow outside of our power.

This account--to the extent I have done it any justice--names exactly
the sort of dynamic that the **[American Legal Realists]{.underline}**
and their [allies in Europe]{.underline} were getting at.

Realism is often treated as a pure form of functionalism: the internal
logic of socio-legal forms should be ignored in favor of asking how a
given legal rule serves broader policy goals. [[Law and
econ]{.underline}]{.mark}omics has [[claimed]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[mantle of realism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[under this
guise]{.underline}]{.mark}: all legal rules should be seen as
instrumental to the maximization of an exogenously defined social
welfare function. CLS has done so in a different way: **[[taking legal
forms too seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a [[form
of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[false consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to avoid confronting]{.underline}]{.mark} the real, deep,
**[[existential-moral question]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of how to strive
for]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[society]{.underline}]{.mark} totally [[free
of alienation and domination]{.underline}]{.mark}. When liberal legal
theorists talk about realism, it is usually just the slogan "every legal
question is actually a policy question" that they have in mind.

## Perm

### Perm\-\--2NC

#### The plan creates the worst of [BOTH WORLDS]{.underline}. 

**Nieto '22** \[Maxi, Professor & Researcher, Miguel Hernández
University. "Market Socialism: The Impossible Socialism." Science &
Society, Volume 86, Issue 1.\]

Against Schweickart's view, we can conclude that [an **[economy is not
a]{.mark} kind of [salad]{.mark}** made [of **elements**]{.mark} **that
can be [combined at will]{.mark}**. Capitalism and communism respond to
**[antagonistic principles of]{.mark} operation and [economic
organization]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[like]{.mark} the [market and
planning]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [which [seek to **exclude each
other**]{.mark} in order [to **effectively deploy** their **respective
potentialities**]{.mark}. [Planning and markets are not neutral
"instruments]{.mark}" of allocation that can be "[used" across
different]{.mark} social [settings but]{.mark} rather **[institutional
expressions of distinct social structures]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Obviously, there will never be pure capitalism (markets) or communism
(planning), since these will always materialize in a symbiotic or
conflictive relationship with other economic and institutional elements
that are alien to each, giving rise to different configurations of these
two systems. But that is one thing; it is quite another to assume that a
complex economy does not necessarily rest on a certain logic or basic
articulating principle, if, as one must assume, it aspires to be viable
and effective.

#### The perm's '[success]{.underline}' destroys the alt.

**Kotz '25** \[David; April 21; Professor Emeritus, Economics,
University of Massachusetts Amherst, PhD, Economics, Berkeley; Socialism
for Today: Escaping the Cruelties of Capitalism, "Lessons from the Past
for a Socialist Future," Ch. 4\]. sofia

The above examples also illustrate the [role of **ideology** in the
process of]{.underline} attempted [transitions to market
socialism.]{.underline} There are two sides to this process. First, the
[**[dominant]{.mark} economic [ideas]{.mark}** in the
[capitalist]{.mark} world]{.underline} -- that is, neoclassical economic
thought -- can **[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [intellectuals in
**[socialist]{.mark}** countries]{.underline}. The [Soviet]{.underline}
case [illustrated that process]{.underline}, as large numbers of Soviet
intellectuals, and particularly [economists]{.underline}, [rapidly
[shift]{.mark}ed [from]{.mark} a [belief in]{.mark} a planned
economy]{.underline} [and [public ownership]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} an equally **[strongly held]{.underline}** new
[**belief** in [free markets]{.mark} and private property]{.underline}.
This can propel a move toward market socialism. However, the
[underlying]{.underline} new [beliefs]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[influential intellectuals]{.underline} do not stop there but are really
an [advocacy for **replacing** socialism with capitalism]{.underline}.26

The other side of the role of ideology is the [tendency]{.underline} [of
**[market]{.mark} [relations]{.mark}** to produce and
**[reinforce]{.mark}**]{.underline} a [**belief** in market
[ideology]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In a society organized around market
relations]{.underline}, [those]{.underline} [who]{.underline}
[succeed]{.underline} in the market tend to [credit]{.underline} their
success to their [own virtues]{.underline} and [believe]{.underline}
[they are]{.underline} thereby [entitled]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
keep the [revenue]{.underline} that flows to them. Those who do not
succeed tend to think it is their own fault. Thus, market allocation
tends to appear fair and just. As [market relations]{.underline}
expanded in China in the 1980s, it [promote]{.underline}d [a belief in
[neoclassical]{.mark}]{.underline} [ideas]{.underline}. Neoclassical
ideology, which claims that market allocation can work effectively only
with private ownership, provided a handy justification for those who
were growing rich through market activity to be allowed to own an
enterprise.

The examples of market socialism discussed above all involved evolution
from the Soviet model. Would [the tendency for a market]{.underline}
[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} that emerges [in a Soviet-model
country]{.underline} to [lead to a]{.underline} [**[transition]{.mark}**
[to capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} also apply to a market socialist
system born out of capitalism? [Any market socialist
system]{.underline}, regardless of its origins, [would]{.underline}
[produce]{.underline} [a wealthy]{.underline} [class]{.underline} of
those who succeed in market activity. The new rich, aspiring to multiply
their [wealth]{.underline} [through]{.underline} [ownership of
productive property,]{.underline} would [pose a **[threat]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a socialist [system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Also, market

David Kotz: The [idea of combining market allocation]{.underline} [with
socialist planning]{.underline} has a long history. New models of
[market socialism]{.underline} were [proposed]{.underline}
[following]{.underline} the [collapse of the]{.underline}
[Soviet]{.underline} model in 1991. The hope was that markets would
guarantee economic efficiency while a socialist state assured economic
justice and material security. **[[Market
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** did not emerge in Russia after the
collapse of state socialism, but it did [[**emerge** in
**China**]{.mark} after 1978]{.underline} under the post-Mao leadership
of Deng Xiaoping. In China, **[[market forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**
were [**[introduced]{.mark}** gradually]{.underline} and
[with]{.underline} a [**high degree** of state
**oversight**]{.underline} to avoid economic chaos. The record shows
that [market socialism]{.underline} not only [**[reproduced]{.mark}**
many of the [**problems** of capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} but has a
[tendency to **[promote a return]{.mark}** to capitalism]{.underline}.
That's [because]{.underline} [[market]{.underline}
[forces]{.underline}]{.mark} can [do their job of allocating
resources]{.underline} only [by **[activati]{.mark}ng**]{.underline} the
**[[profit motive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as]{.underline} the [primary
force of productive activity.]{.underline}

This paper is about the [dissemination of knowledge]{.underline} across
the [**curriculum** and the **role**]{.underline} business [education
can play in]{.underline} [[elevat]{.mark}ing [student
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} and understanding of interdisciplinary
thoughts. Most importantly, it **[[explores]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[importance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
thoughtful appreciation of divergent [[educational
paradigms]{.underline}]{.mark} and how such an
[[appreciation]{.underline}]{.mark} can be the **[[bridge
toward]{.underline}]{.mark}** cohesive, contemporary, and [[meaningful
learning]{.underline}]{.mark}. The paper builds on an experience of team
teaching an interdisciplinary honors course, "Ways of Knowing".
Throughout the paper, we illustrate the ideological conflicts that
emerged in this experience, and the realization of their sources and
reasons. The paper also provides the contrast that could begin to
explain how these tensions could be relaxed, as well as [outlines the
need to transcend **disciplinary barriers**]{.underline} [through
informed understanding and appreciation]{.underline}.

Introduction This paper is a [timely discussion]{.underline} on the
[[criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the context of management education. Today many business educators
find themselves on the defensive. The [[debate
surrounding]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[failure]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
[[of economic structures]{.underline}]{.mark} and the call to move away
from the pure tenants of capitalism, have led many of us to [[engage
in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[vigorous debates]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[value of]{.underline}]{.mark} management
[[education]{.underline}]{.mark} with colleagues across disciplines.
This paper shares the experience of such a debate in a context of an
interdisciplinary course, taught by four faculty members in four
disciplines. While the details of this particular team teaching
experience are unique, the themes are not (Morris and Maranville, 1999).
As faculty representing business education, the challenge was in the
search for moral high ground in defense of an arena that is commonly
perceived as a 'swamp' by many of its critics and proponents (Schon,
1995).

The interdisciplinary course, through which the ensuing debate was
framed, commenced with the creation of a common syllabus. Several items
solidified into a course plan. Each of the four faculty participants
would independently choose the reading material, and pedagogical style
for his/her specific area. Further, a philosopher would first cover the
liberal arts, then a physicist would cover the natural sciences, then a
political scientist would cover the social sciences, and finally the
[management professor would cover business and management]{.underline}.
Accordingly, as we prepared for the course it seemed to be an
interesting interdisciplinary synthesis that was straightforward, and
un-political.

But, as the [philosophe]{.underline}r presented Marcuse's (1964)
"One-Dimensional Man" (a scathing indictment of the uncritical and
conformist acceptance of existing structures, norms, and behaviors,) the
management professor (and one of the authors) felt completely unprepared
to the reaction of the class, and the reaction of his colleagues. He
found himself [unexpectedly defending]{.underline} the [virtue of
capitalism and management [by arguing]{.mark}]{.underline}, with an
increasingly strained voice, for reason and moderation. Unfortunately,
given the young 2 idealistic audience, the fallout from a deluge of
recent [corporate scandals and economic failures]{.underline}, the
obvious problems in capitalism, the liberal orientation of his
colleagues, and the tactical problem that it was pedagogically not the
management professor's turn, it was an extraordinarily weak defense. The
**[[critics were emboldened]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the supporters
(if present) were ominously silent.

Initially the [pedagogical plan]{.underline} of the management faculty
was as follows: on day one discuss Harvard Business School's classic
case "The Rose Company," and Winner's (1975) chapter on "Complexity and
the Limits of Human Understanding;" on day two discuss Thomas and
Tyman's (1982) "Necessary Properties of Relevant Research,"
Shrivastava's (1987) "Rigor and Practical Usefulness of Research in
Strategic Management;" and Venkatraman and Grant's (1985) "Construct
Measurement in Organizational Strategy Research;" on day three discuss
The Academy of Management's Presidential addresses of Bedeian (1989),
Hambrick (1993), Mowday (1996), Huff (1999), and Van de Ven (2002); and
on day four discuss Johnson and Duberley's (2002) book "Understanding
Management Research: [An Introduction to Epistemology]{.underline}."

After the philosopher's first day presentation, the management faculty
realized that he needed a change in plan. From that point, he listened
carefully and [noted the major issues and criticisms]{.underline}. He
proceeded to [prepare careful ideological and educational
counterarguments]{.underline}, on the basis of which he developed the
remainder of his course module. In the remaining sections of this paper,
we present the criticisms (from students and faculty colleagues,) as
well as the counter arguments in this debate that followed throughout
the semester. We believe that similar discussions need and will take
place as an **[[integral part of management
education]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The aim is not necessarily to defend
the tenants of capitalism, but rather to [[explain and
clarify]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[issues]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order
to [[engage in]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[informed and constructive
dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Perm\-\--Ext

#### Any inclusion of a market-based profit motive [dooms]{.underline} the alt.

**Nieto '22** \[Maxi Nieto; Professor and Researcher of Macroeconomics
at Miguel Hernández University; Science and Society, "Market Socialism:
The Impossible Socialism," vol. 86; Jan. 2022;
https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/siso.2022.86.1.66\] // K Nahm

The axis of our critique of market socialism is that [[any market-based
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, founded on the autonomous initiative of
companies, [[will be **incompatible** with]{.mark} the
[conscious]{.mark}]{.underline}, rational, and democratic
[[regulation]{.mark} of activity]{.underline}. [The [fragmentation of
the productive apparatus]{.mark}]{.underline} into rival companies
[[implies]{.mark} both [that]{.mark} the decision-making process be
atomized and that the surplus be kept in private hands, which prevents
the direction of]{.underline} economic [development according
to]{.underline} the [free will]{.underline} of citizens. [As long as
markets subsist]{.underline} as a general structure of pro-duction and
investment, **[[the logic of capital will govern]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[so that the economic process will]{.mark} necessarily [operate
under]{.mark}]{.underline} spontaneous and automatic conditions,
regulated by [[its]{.underline}]{.mark} own internal **[[need for
reproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (equal to the needs of capital and
not those of the population). In this context, [public intervention
will]{.underline} inevitably [have a]{.underline} very [limited effect
and]{.underline} will [be unable to develop]{.underline} far [beyond
what exists in contemporary economies]{.underline}.

[[Transforming capitalist]{.mark} production and property [relations in
a socialist sense **cannot**]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [[consist
of simply]{.underline}]{.mark} putting an end to individual ownership of
the means of production, turning salaried workers into cooperative
members. Such [[a]{.mark} [change in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[legal
status]{.mark} of companies and workers]{.underline} will leave the
capitalist logic of profit and accumulation intact, so that its main
laws (cost competition, concentration, falling tendency of
profitability) and most of its problems (imbalances, instability,
inequality, unemployment, waste or under-utilization of resources) would
be maintained. [Insofar as]{.underline} its [[activities]{.mark} are
[based on]{.mark} [profit]{.mark} maximization and
accumulation]{.underline}, [a cooperative will be **as capitalist a
company** as any other]{.underline}. Under ED, companies continue to be
private production units (now under the legal form of cooperatives), so
surpluses generated in a national economy remain fragmented and under
the control of the various cooperatives. The [natural tendency of
this]{.underline} type of [model]{.underline} (as in Yugoslavia)
[is]{.underline} to continually expand the commercial radius of action
and to grant increasing autonomy to cooperatives: financially, in order
to agree on loan conditions; in accounting, to manage the amortization
of investments; commercially, to establish agreements with other
companies (including from capitalist countries); and organizationally,
[to [adopt]{.mark} more [**technocratic** and **hierarchical**]{.mark}
forms of [direction]{.mark} and management]{.underline}, [[for the sake
of efficiency]{.underline}]{.mark}.

From this perspective, [[socialism is reduced to a mere legal
question]{.underline}]{.mark}, relative to the juridical ownership of
the means of production, with the aim of achieving self-management in
the workplace and amore equitable distribution of income. [It is [no
longer]{.mark} understood as [a **truly alternative** socioeconomic
order]{.mark} based on the conscious and democratic control of
production]{.underline}. For this reason, [[market
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark} if applied would
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} be anyt[[hing other than]{.underline}]{.mark}
"capitalism without capitalists," [[a **variant of capitalism**]{.mark}
that removes the figure of the individual capitalist but maintains its
fundamental determinations]{.underline}, and most of its problems. This
is [already clear without assessing its institutional
viability]{.underline}; it remains to be seen whether market socialism
can foster a robust and durable structure capable of perpetuating itself
without quickly leading back to some form of traditional capitalism.

#### [Top-down efforts]{.underline} at liberating the commons from capital [fail]{.underline} --- alt alone solves best.

**Gerhardt '23** \[Hannes Gerhardt; D. Professor of Geography. School of
Field Investigations and Experimental Sciences Dr. Perry College of
Mathematics, Computing, and Sciences; "From Capital to Commons:
Exploring the Promise of a World Beyond Capitalism" (p.27--28); Jul
2023\] // K Nahm

[A third option]{.underline}, which breaks with both the autonomist and
anarchist frameworks, [is [to embrace the state as an **instrumental
actor** in liberating]{.mark} and then harnessing [the commons]{.mark}
to bring about a seismic shift [out of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This mostly reformist approach is well captured in the work of Paul
Mason (2016), who views the potential of a scarcity-busting freed
general intellect primarily through the lens of [state-based leadership
and command]{.underline}. Mason's focus therefore quickly turns to the
need for large government-driven programmes [involving the breaking up
of monopolies and targeted nationalizations]{.underline}, hi-tech
[macroeconomic planning, debt management, and a top-down effort to
tackle climate change]{.underline}. In taking this position, however,
[the bottom-up impetus of commons-based peer production, where 'the
state' is [generally viewed with]{.mark} a good deal of
[skepticism]{.mark}, is mostly abandoned]{.underline}. Instead, Mason
falls back to a politics and economics that are largely in line with
standard democratic-socialist discourses.

[While this direction is]{.underline} probably the most [likely to be
adopted by leftist]{.underline} politicians and parties today,
[it]{.underline} also [has its share of]{.underline} serious
[pitfalls]{.underline}. Autonomist and anarchist scholars of the
commons, for instance, adamantly argue that [[the state is **hopelessly
intertwined** with]{.mark} the dictates of capital, forming [a
capital-state nexus that renders any vision of a state-led evolution out
of capital an **unrealistic fantasy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A further
and more immediate challenge, however, especially considering its more
mainstream, change-from-within outlook, is that [socialist discourses
are]{.underline} largely [failing to garner]{.underline} the [electoral
support they]{.underline} would [need]{.underline} to pursue the
envisioned unleashing of the commons. This is likely the result of these
discourses having increasingly lost touch with the changes taking place
in capitalism and the subsequent shift in the workforce and labour's
self-perception. [The [failure of socialist parties]{.mark},
organizations, and unions to prevent the eroding of the middle
class]{.underline} amidst widespread deindustrialization undoubtedly
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[played a role]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
this sense a general [[skepticism]{.mark} has set in [towards the idea
of 'the state' as a representative of the people]{.mark}'s
will]{.underline}, reflecting to some extent the anarchist/autonomist
position noted earlier.

Within this context, then, it should [not]{.underline} be [surprising
that the]{.underline} increasingly dominant [post baby-boom generation
finds itself]{.underline} largely [[**unconvinced** by]{.mark}
suggestions of [shifting economic control from capital to the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, exchanging one distant,
hierarchically organized form of decision making with another. In
Europe, this generational [[attitude]{.mark} is [reflected in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} plummeting of traditional party membership and,
more particularly, the broad **[[implosion of the socialist
left]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where, with a few exceptions, neither
moderate nor more radical leftist parties can gain much electoral
traction (van Haute, 2011; Taylor, 2018). In the US, in turn, while
younger adults appear to be warming somewhat to the term 'socialism'
(the term is generally not defined in polls), [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the same time, [[a **deep lack of
confidence** in government]{.mark} in general]{.underline} (Jones and
Saad, 2019; Pew, 2021). Given these trends and attitudes, rooted in the
reality of a capital-state nexus that takes more than an election to
overcome, it is [[difficult to see how]{.mark} a
[post-capitalist]{.mark} political [economy]{.mark} could effectively
[spawn from a]{.mark} big-[government]{.mark}, socialist
[platform]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Market ideology is a [dead-end]{.underline} --- any chance the perm solves reproduces and revives capitalism.

from the Past for a Socialist Future," Ch. 4; 27 Jan. 2025;

// K Nahm

The other side of [the role of ideology is the tendency of market
relations to produce and reinforce a **belief in [market
ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In a society organized around market
relations, [those who succeed]{.underline} in the market tend to [credit
their success to their own virtues]{.underline} and believe they are
thereby entitled to keep the revenue that flows to them. [Those who do
not]{.underline} succeed [tend to think it is their own
fault]{.underline}. [Thus, market allocation tends to appear fair and
just]{.underline}. As market relations expanded in China in the 1980s,
it [[promote]{.underline}]{.mark}d [a belief in **[neoclassical
ideas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Neoclassical ideology, which claims that
market allocation can work effectively only with private ownership,
[provided a handy justification for those who were growing
rich]{.underline} through market activity [to be allowed to own an
enterprise]{.underline}.

The examples of market socialism discussed above all involved evolution
from the Soviet model. Would the tendency for a market socialism that
emerges in a Soviet-model country to lead to a transition to capitalism
also apply to a market socialist system born out of capitalism? [[Any
market]{.mark} socialist [system, **regardless of its origins**,]{.mark}
would produce a wealthy class of those who succeed in market
activity]{.underline}. [The new rich]{.underline}, aspiring to multiply
their wealth through ownership of productive property, [[would pose a
threat to a socialist system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Also, [[market
relations]{.mark} have a]{.underline} powerful [tendency to
[operate]{.mark}]{.underline}, not as an innocent allocator of
resources, but [[**as a socializer** that teaches]{.mark}
individualism]{.underline}, pursuit of narrow
[[self-interest]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and a drive to rise above
others]{.underline}.

A review of the previous efforts to build a socialist system offers two
lessons. First, many socialists drew an unjustified conclusion from [the
[problems of the Soviet model]{.mark}]{.underline} and particularly from
its demise during 1989‒91. While supporters of [capitalism gleefully
announced in 1991 that socialism had failed]{.underline}, many
[socialists sought to deny that claim by arguing that only economic
planning and public ownership had failed]{.underline}. However, [that
conclusion [left **nothing recognizable** of socialism]{.mark} as it had
always been understood by socialists]{.underline}. A more [persuasive
inference from]{.underline} those events [is that a particular form
of]{.underline} socialism -- one based on highly centralized and
hierarchical planning and [an authoritarian and repressive
state]{.underline} -- [had]{.underline}, after bringing decades of
uneven economic advance, [failed]{.underline}. That experience showed
the positive potential of economic planning and public ownership but
also revealed the serious flaws and ultimate unsustainability of the
Soviet version of socialism.

Second, [[the desperate attempt to **salvage something** from the
socialist idea]{.underline},]{.mark} [in a period when market ideology
was dominant in society, [by seeking to base]{.mark} a future [socialism
on market allocation is a **dead end** ]{.mark}**for
socialism**]{.underline}. The experience of past efforts to build a
[market-based socialism]{.underline} first [reproduced]{.underline} the
problems of [capitalism and]{.underline} ultimately [led to its
revival]{.underline}. The recent proposals for a future market socialism
call for a system almost identical to [[reformed
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[leaves]{.underline}]{.mark}
such [[calls]{.mark} without [a]{.mark}ny]{.underline} plausible [[path
to the revolutionary transformation of property
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} that would be required to bring it about.
Even if such a market socialism could appear in the future, it would
contain powerful forces to revert back to capitalism.

[[The **only viable**]{.mark} **and sustainable** socialist [future lies
in]{.mark} a system of [economic planning and public
ownership]{.mark}]{.underline}, although one that is organized
differently from the Soviet model, along with a different form of the
state. It requires a system of democratic participatory planning,
various forms of public ownership, and a democratic state.

### Perm\-\--AT: Regulated Capitalism\-\--2NC

#### '[Regulated]{.underline} capitalism' reproduces [health]{.underline} effects, [imperialism]{.underline}, AND [warming]{.underline}.

**Kotz '25** \[David; April 21; Professor Emeritus, Economics,
University of Massachusetts Amherst, PhD, Economics, Berkeley; Socialism
for Today: Escaping the Cruelties of Capitalism, "Reform of Capitalism,"

Despite new environmental regulations, [the **profit** and growth
**imperatives** of capitalism **generated** a constant
**war**]{.underline} between high-priced lawyers and lobbyists for
industry and the often understaffed and underfinanced regulatory
authorities. The search for [profit led to the **introduction** of many
new materials and **chemicals**]{.underline}, which entered the natural
environment -- and people's bodies -- without any study of the possible
long-term effects on public health. Some [specialists]{.underline} have
[suggested that new chemicals and materials might be the **cause**
of]{.underline} recent problematic public health developments such as
increases in certain **[cancers]{.underline}** and other illnesses,
[**declining fertility** rates]{.underline}, [and earlier onset of
puberty]{.underline}.

[The **imperialist drive**]{.underline} of capitalism [was not
tamed]{.underline} in postwar reformed capitalism. [The
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, now the leading
capitalist power, [exercised **domination** over]{.underline} many
countries in [Latin America]{.underline}, [Africa]{.underline}, and
[Asia]{.underline}. The US government intervened militarily in many
countries to support, or install, regimes that would protect US business
interests, to the detriment of the local population. Examples were [US
**interventions** in Iran in **1953**]{.underline}, [Guatemala in
**1954**]{.underline}, [Cuba in **1961**]{.underline}, [the Dominican
Republic in **1965**]{.underline}, [and Vietnam from the
mid-**1950s**]{.underline} until 1975.13 Such interventions and wars
caused many deaths and injuries for American military personnel and the
local population. [This imperialist drive required a huge military
**budget** that **squeezed** the resources available for **social
programs**]{.underline}. As of this writing, the Biden Administration,
while pursuing mildly social democratic domestic policies, has been
openly aiming to maintain US domination over the global system,
including demanding big increases in military spending.

[Capitalist democracies remained only **partially
democratic**]{.underline}, as wealthy individuals and large corporations
remained politically powerful. In the United States, [the most powerful
business **interests** were able to use state power to **avoid
taxation**]{.underline} and guarantee high profits at the expense of the
people, for example in oil and gas extraction.

Perhaps [the **greatest deficiency**]{.underline} of reformed capitalism
[is the **obstacles** it presents to]{.underline} effectively
**[combating]{.underline}** the threat of global **[climate
change]{.underline}**. One obstacle comes from the wealth and political
power of the fossil fuel companies. That sector of [**big business**
finances the dissemination of **disinformation** about climate change
and **funds politicians**]{.underline} who will oppose any measures to
solve the problem. There is some hope that popular mobilization of the
majority who will suffer from climate change can become an effective
counterforce. However, whether that can work soon enough to prevent
passing the climate tipping point is uncertain.

A different kind of obstacle is rooted in the structure of reformed
capitalism. Since it is a form of capitalism, [it has a powerful drive
to **produce**]{.underline} more and more **[commodities]{.underline}**,
[independent of any improvement in human welfare]{.underline} that might
result. Competition in pursuit of profit drives that dynamic, and no
reform of capitalism can extinguish that force. Further, the postwar
**[decades]{.underline}** of reformed capitalism [**suggest** that such
a form of capitalism brings **faster** economic **growth**]{.underline}
than a relatively unmodified capitalism. [The stability of reformed
capitalism is **based** on wages and profits rising
**together**]{.underline}, which can be achieved under capitalism only
with growing output of commodities. [It may be **impossible** to
**arrest**]{.underline} global [**climate change** under any
form]{.underline} of capitalism.

### Perm\-\--AT: Innovation Socialism\-\--2NC

#### Their techno-cruel optimism is a [utopian fantasy]{.underline} that locks in [fossil expansionism]{.underline} thru [distractionism]{.underline} and [alienating allies]{.underline}.

I find it hard to imagine that any on the climate left would actually
support the reactionary and destructive path I have outlined above. [CCS
[defenders might argue]{.mark}]{.underline} that [this [scenario
represents]{.mark} a **grotesque** and [**unjust application**
of]{.mark} an **otherwise [neutral tech]{.mark}nology** that
nevertheless has some promise if implemented more carefully and
democratically]{.underline} by the public sector, perhaps with
better-chosen sites and so on. Some might argue we should focus on DAC
and not CCS more broadly. But I believe [the [reactionary
decarb]{.mark}onization path underway in the Gulf [has two important
implications]{.mark} for **carbon management
techno-optimism**]{.underline}, with or without such caveats.

[[First, techno-utopian visions]{.mark} of how CCS can be managed in
democratic and public ways [are **so remote from reality**]{.mark} as
[to be]{.mark} **practically [irrelevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Left
support]{.mark} for CCS [will only **add cover and legitimacy** to
fossil fuel and]{.mark} other **[corporate interests]{.mark}** who are
pushing this pathway regardless, and [at no point will anyone]{.mark}
involved in this industry [take such views
**seriously**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One can always say that, with
**some social movement in place** and enough power exerted, a technology
can be expropriated and repurposed]{.underline} to socialist ends and so
on. [But [for this to be a critical theory]{.mark} rather than a sterile
utopia, [it must be demonstrated]{.mark} that [this is a]{.mark}n
**unrealized [possibility]{.mark}** within the **current structure of
society**]{.underline}. Is there any basis in our current reality to
believe that, in the next (say) twenty five years to thirty years there
is a pathway from what we have now---state subsidies for fossil
investment capital to earn windfalls in whatever CCS project offers a
buck, regardless of who is harmed, what ecologies are permanently
undermined, or whether it even contributes to net carbon dioxide
reductions---to a democratically-run public sector carbon management
system? It is difficult to see it. [But even if that is what the
techno-optimists are fighting for, one would still need to be against
the **present incarnation** of fossil fuel-driven CCS and thus logically
allied with **current grassroots struggles against it**]{.underline}.

[This leads me to my [second]{.mark} conclusion. The fossil fuel
industry is pursuing CCS with **bipartisan elite support**. What seems
like an unnecessary distraction is lending them **more political
cover**]{.underline}. [If we take seriously the idea that there must be
an **actual transition** from fossil fuels and that it must be "just,"
then the current CCS boom is **exhibit A** for how not to achieve
that]{.underline}. This also means that [[defensive struggles
against]{.mark} the false solutions of [reactionary
decarb]{.mark}onization [are]{.mark} very much [a **necessary part** of

To see why, we must revisit the concept of capitalism. Contrary to the
usual view, [capitalism is **not an economic system**]{.underline} but
something bigger. More than a way of organizing economic production and
exchange, [it is]{.underline} also [a way of organizing the relation of
production and exchange to]{.underline} [the]{.underline}ir
[non-economic conditions of possibility]{.underline}. It is well
understood in many quarters that [[capitalist societies institutionalize
a]{.mark}]{.underline} dedicated 'economic' realm---the [[realm
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a peculiar [**[abstraction]{.mark}** [known as
'**value'**]{.mark}]{.underline}---where commodities are produced
through privately owned means of production by exploited wage labourers
and sold on price-setting markets by private firms, all with the aim of
generating profits and accumulating capital. What is often overlooked,
however, is that [this realm is **constitutively
dependent**]{.underline}---one could say, parasitic---[on a host
of]{.underline} social [activities]{.underline}, political capacities,
[and]{.underline} natural [processes]{.underline} that are
[defined]{.underline} in capitalist societies [as
non-economic]{.underline}. Accorded no 'value' and positioned outside
it, these constitute the economy's indispensable presuppositions.
Certainly, commodity [production is [inconceivable
without]{.mark}]{.underline} the unwaged activities of social
reproduction that form and sustain the human beings who perform wage
labour. Nor could such production exist apart from the natural processes
that assure availability of vital inputs, including [[raw materials
and]{.underline}]{.mark} sources of [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Neither, finally, would profit or capital be possible without the legal
orders, repressive forces and public goods that underpin private
property and contractual exchange. Essential conditions for a capitalist
economy, these [[non-economic instances are not external]{.mark} to
capitalism, [but integral]{.mark} elements of it. Conceptions of
capitalism that omit them are ideological]{.underline}. [To equate
capitalism with its economy is to parrot the system's own **economistic
self-understanding**---and thus to miss the chance to interrogate it
critically]{.underline}. To gain a critical perspective, we must
understand capitalism broadly---as an institutionalized social order
that encompasses not only the economy but also those activities,
relations and processes, defined as 'non-economic', that make 'the
economy' possible.

What is gained from this revision is the ability to [examine something
crucial: [the relation]{.mark} established in capitalist societies
[between the economy and]{.mark}]{.underline} its 'others'---including
[[that **vital other known as nature**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At its
core, [this relation [is contradictory]{.mark} and
crisis-prone]{.underline}. On the one hand, [the system's]{.underline}
economy is constitutively [dependent on nature]{.underline}, both [as a
tap for]{.underline} production's [inputs and as a sink for]{.underline}
disposing its [waste]{.underline}. At the same time, [capitalist society
institutes a stark division between the two
'realms']{.underline}---constructing the economy as a field of creative
human action that generates value while [positioning ['nature'
as]{.mark} a realm of stuff, **devoid of value, but [infinitely
self-replenishing]{.mark}** and generally available to be processed [in
**commodity production**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This ontological gulf [becomes a]{.mark} raging inferno when capital
enters]{.underline} the mix. [A **[monetized abstraction]{.mark}**
engineered to self-expand, capital commands accumulation without
end]{.underline}. The effect is to incentivize owners [bent on
maximizing profits to commandeer nature's gifts as cheaply as
possible]{.underline}, while also absolving them of any obligation to
replenish what they take and repair what they damage. The **[damages are
the flip-side of the profits]{.underline}**. With their
ecological-reproduction costs discounted, all the major inputs to
capitalist production and circulation are vastly cheapened---not 'just'
raw materials, energy and transport, but also labour, as wages fall with
the cost of living when capital wrests food from nature on the cheap. In
every case, capitalists appropriate the savings from cheap inputs in the
form of profit, while passing the environmental costs to those who must
live with---and die from---the fallout, including future generations.

[More than a relation to labour]{.underline}, then, [[capital
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a relation to
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}---[a]{.underline} predatory, [**extractive**
relation]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} [consumes]{.mark}]{.underline}
ever more [[biophysical]{.mark} wealth]{.underline} in order [to pile
up]{.underline} ever more '[[value']{.underline}]{.mark}, [[while
**disavowing ecological 'externalities'**]{.underline}]{.mark}. What
also piles up, not accidentally, is an ever-growing mountain of
eco-wreckage: an atmosphere flooded by carbon emissions; climbing
temperatures, crumbling polar ice shelves, rising seas clogged with
islands of plastic; mass extinctions, declining biodiversity,
climate-driven migration of organisms and pathogens, increased zoonotic
spillovers of deadly viruses; superstorms, megadroughts, giant locust
swarms, jumbo wildfires, titanic flooding; dead zones, poisoned lands,
unbreathable air. Systemically primed to free-ride on a nature that
cannot really self-replenish without limit, [capitalism's economy is
always on the verge of **destabilizing its own ecological conditions**
of possibility]{.underline}.

[[Here]{.underline}]{.mark}, in effect, [[is an ecological contradiction
lodged at the **heart** of capitalist
society]{.underline}]{.mark}-----[the relation this society establishes
between economy and nature]{.underline}. Grounded deep in the system's
structure, this contradiction is encapsulated in four D-words:
dependence, division, disavowal and destabilization. In a nutshell:
[[capitalist society]{.mark} makes 'economy' depend on
'nature']{.underline}, [while dividing them ontologically]{.underline}.
Enjoining endless [accumulation of value]{.underline}, [while defining
nature as not partaking of]{.underline} it, this arrangement
[[**programmes economy** to disavow the ecological reproduction costs it
generates]{.underline}.]{.mark} The effect, as those costs mount
exponentially, is [to destabilize ecosystems]{.underline}---and,
periodically, to disrupt the entire jerry-rigged edifice of capitalist
society. [[Simultaneously needing and rubbishing
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, capitalism is a cannibal that devours its
own vital organs, [like a serpent that eats its own tail]{.underline}.

The contradiction can also be formulated in terms of class power. By
definition, capitalist societies devolve the task of organizing
production to capital, or rather, to those dedicated to its
accumulation. It is the class of capitalists whom this system licenses
to extract raw materials, generate energy, determine land use, engineer
food systems, bio-prospect medicinals and dispose of waste---effectively
ceding to them the lion's share of control over air and water, soil and
minerals, flora and fauna, forests and oceans, atmosphere and climate,
which is to say, over all the basic conditions that sustain life on
Earth. [Capitalist society thus vests a class that is strongly motivated
to trash nature with the power to manage our relations with
it]{.underline}.

Granted, [[governments]{.mark} sometimes [intervene]{.mark} post hoc [to
mitigate]{.mark} the [damages]{.mark}]{.underline}---but always
reactively, in the mode of catch-up, and [[without disturbing]{.mark}
the owners' [prerogatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because [[they are
**always a step behind**]{.underline}]{.mark} the emitters of greenhouse
gases, environmental regulations are easily subverted by corporate
workarounds. And [[because they leave intact]{.mark} the structural
divisions that license private firms to organize production, **they do
not alter the fundamental fact**]{.underline}: [[the]{.mark} system
gives capitalists]{.underline} motive, means and [[opportunity to savage
the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is they, and not humans in general,
who have brought us global warming---but not by chance or simple greed.
Rather, [the dynamic that has governed their actions and led to that
outcome is **[baked into the very structure of capitalist
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

Whichever formulation we start with, [the conclusion]{.underline} we
reach [is the same:]{.underline} [[capitalistically organized societies
carry an **ecological contradiction in their dna**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
They are [[primed to precipitate 'natural
catastrophes']{.underline}]{.mark}, which occur periodically but not
accidentally throughout their history. Thus, these [societies harbour a
built-in tendency to ecological crisis]{.underline}. [They generate
ecosystemic vulnerabilities]{.underline} on an ongoing basis, [[as
part]{.mark} and parcel [of their modus operandi]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although not always acute or even apparent, the vulnerabilities pile up
over time, until a tipping point is reached and the damage bursts forth
into view. I shall consider some historical examples in the following
section.

Here, however, I have been stressing the structural character of this
[tendency]{.underline}. The point is all-important, not least for its
practical entailments. [To say that capitalism's ecological problem is
structural is to say that [**we cannot save the planet** without]{.mark}
disabling]{.underline} some core, defining features of [our social
order]{.underline}. [What is needed]{.underline}, first and foremost,
[is to wrest]{.underline} the power to dictate [our relation to nature
away from the class that]{.underline} currently [monopolizes it, so that
we can begin to **reinvent that relation from the ground
up**]{.underline}. But [that **requires [dismantling the
system]{.mark}** [that underpins their power:]{.mark} the
military]{.underline} forces [and property]{.underline} forms,
[the]{.underline} pernicious [ontology of 'value']{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the relentless dynamic of [accumulation]{.underline},
all of which work together to drive global warming. Eco-[[politics
must]{.underline}]{.mark}, in sum, [[be
anti-capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new
wave of Arctic settler colonialism. We argue that, although projects for
resource exploitation of the Arctic are achieving unprecedented scale,
they represent a continuity of the colonial project, benefitting from
the way previous waves of colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic
spaces and the relations between Indigenous peoples and their
traditional territories. Our discussion is focused on the impacts of
colonialism over the Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit
homeland -- and the impacts of colonialism over the relation between
State, indigenous peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a
discussion of the Arctic resource boom and the strategic and development
projects emerging in the Arctic policies of littoral states and their
treatment of indigenous issues amid economic and strategic pressures to
carve out new extractive enclaves in Arctic territories. We depart from
a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to understand how
the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American populations and
the importance of resource extraction shaped contemporary Arctic spaces
-- from baleen and whale oil to the gold rush and discovery of
hydrocarbons. One important element here is to understand how this first
moment of colonialism set up the conditions for modern-day resource
development projects. The discussion, then, turns to contemporary
economic development projects in the Arctic, understanding them as
neo-extractivist enterprises -- i.e., enterprises that rely heavily on
resource development and control over space in a late capitalist
globalized economy. As such, these projects represent a geographical
expansion of extractive frontiers in a global scale, seeking new
resource reserves and to reshape space to make them commercially viable.
This represents a new wave of colonialism -- i.e., of attempts by state
and capital to enhance control over traditional indigenous territories
-- and a new wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples from their rights to their traditional lands and
livelihoods. Old colonialisms: the colonial encounter in Inuit Nunaat
'Government, as such, was introduced when the whaling fleet came to the
Beaufort Sea, when the trappers came to the Canadian Arctic, and when
the Danes came to Greenland. Behind them came the Christian
missionaries, and behind them came those who "governed" us.'4) In the
field of International Studies, analyses of Arctic geopolitics and
economic development tend to overlook the process of transformation of
the Arctic in a series of discrete territorial jurisdictions -- and the
colonial violence underpinning such process is generally absent from
historical narratives and theoretical reflections. Since mainstream
theorizations organize their gaze from the point of view of the State,
subnational and non-national, non-state political organizations are
rendered invisible. Therefore, the colonization of Inuit Nunaat -- and,
in fact, the colonization of the traditional homelands of many
indigenous peoples are excluded from theoretical efforts and reflections
developed within international relations in general. The recent spike in
interest in Arctic issues has reproduced such erasures, thinking through
narrow definitions of geopolitics and economic development, seeing such
issues so long as they represent problems and/or opportunities for
Arctic States. This framework has rendered Arctic international
relations into discussions and theorizing of Arctic interstate
relations, excluding indigenous political organizations from such
debates. An account of the colonial encounter in Arctic spaces, more
than a mere historical recapitulation of how States occupied and annexed
Inuit Nunaat into their sovereign jurisdictions, is also a necessary
step in comprehending and theorizing contemporary Arctic environmental,
geopolitical and economic issues. The colonization of Inuit Nunaat by
Westphalian States such as Canada, the US and Russia, left its mark on
several dimensions of Inuit life. Such populations were subject to a
violent process that combined attempts at cultural assimilation with the
disarticulation of their livelihoods and social organization. In her
narrative of the environmental history of the Bering Strait, Demuth
shows how the articulation of indigenous social and economic practices
with the demands of distant markets also brought about ecological
imbalances that upended life in Inuit Nunaat.5) While the colonial
encounter did not mean outright expropriation of land, the discovery of
gold and, afterwards, of oil in Arctic lands and waters radically
changed this scenario. The material aspects of gold mining and oil
extraction required new technologies for controlling space and economic
activity, expanding State and capital control over portions of Inuit
land through enclosure. Bathsheba Demuth6) and Jessica Shadian7) have
written detailed accounts of the colonial past of the Inuit peoples.
Although a people with a large history of contact with European sailors
and explorers in the Arctic, the interest that the Euro-American world
showed for products present in Inuit land was a fatal blow to Inuit
livelihoods, society and culture. Search for products like baleen, whale
oil, walrus tusks and furs articulated subsistence activities of Inuit
communities to the capitalist world market. The pressure in the US
mainland for these products led European and Inuit hunters to team up in
the hunt for whales, walruses and even the Arctic fox, nearly leading
such species to extinction. The multiple dimensions of contact between
US whalers and Inuit communities left a trail of disease, the
near-extinction of these beings rendered subsistence hunting almost
impossible -- leaving a trail of dispossession, misery and disease in
the Arctic. In her account of the environmental history of the floating
coast, Demuth describes how sustained contact between Euro-American
states/societies and the Indigenous peoples of the Arctic also
articulated their livelihoods to the global circuits of capital flows
and global processes of capital accumulation.8) Demuth's work is
precious in its description of the social and ecological impacts of
colonialism -- specially when concerned with the ever-growing need for
resources that came from the region's fauna like whale oil, baleen,
walrus' tusks, fox pelts. Up to 1852, whale, walrus and fox hunting, for
instance, were oriented towards the subsistence of Beringian
communities, with the volume of activity ebbing in consonance with the
rhythms of the lives of such beings. The contact with foreigners,
specially those from the US, was initially driven by commercial whaling
and, eventually, moved on to the hunt for walruses, substitutes for
whale meat and source of materials used in the everyday lives of
indigenous peoples, and of Arctic foxes, valued for their pelts as
fashion accessories in Euro-American societies. This articulation of
regional subsistence economies to those moved by motives of ever-growing
profits of the capitalist Euro-American societies was the main driver of
the predatory hunting of such animals and caused great turmoil in
ecological and socio-economic terms. The predatory hunting of whales and
other animals brought about a deep ecological imbalance. Demuth's
discussion rightly puts it in terms of disappearing calories, of energy
being syphoned away from Arctic waters through the commercial hunting of
Arctic animals. This process dealt a terrible blow to the subsistence of
the indigenous communities of the Arctic, materialized in the emergence
of situations of deep deprivation, with the spread of diseases and vices
(specially alcoholism) throughout Beringia. "The market" Demuth states
"had taken Beringian blubber and traded it back for empty metal pots".9)
Demuth10) and Shadian11) highlight the importance of such ecological
imbalances to the expansion of state control over Inuit communities. The
perception of the social maladies caused by predatory hunting was
deflected to the character of the indigenous communities, both in
Beringian lands, but also in the rest of Inuit Nunaat, legitimizing
policies aimed at remodelling their subjectivities. Paternalist policies
to remedy such ailments were spearheads for assimilationist policies
that sought to impede the reproduction of the Inuit culture. The
remodelling of indigenous subjectivities was one of the main goals,
pursued through Christian indoctrination and a preparation for
subsistence through work in capitalist economies. Coupled with the
social and economic crisis brought about by the disappearing calories,
it is visible a process that, deliberately or not, was bent on the
disarticulation of non-European, non-capitalist social formations, be it
through attacking their material conditions of livelihood or their
cultural practices. These attempts to subsuming indigenous
subjectivities and cultural practices under the demands of global
capitalism, was another important aspect of State policies that sought
not only to extract products from the Arctic, but also to turn the human
element of the region into labour, making them "useful" for the
activities carried on by white settlers in these regions. While
different colonialisms developed across Inuit Nunaat, it is important to
note how, albeit presenting different rationalities across time and
space, they developed the same solution -- enclosure and border-making
-- to the question of how to regulate relations between settler
populations and Inuit peoples. According to Demuth,12) the United States
and the Russian Empire had very similar concerns about the contact
between Arctic indigenous populations and Euro-American settlers
attracted to the region. The commerce of whale-related products and even
of Inuit labour in exchange for firearms, liquor and tobacco was seen as
deleterious for the civilizing projects such empires purported to
represent -- as well as a direct threat to the control over Arctic
spaces in the case of firearms. Enclosures and border making, in this
first moment, served to contain market activity and direct the flow of
goods and the energies of the populations to the objectives of the
sovereign powers that sought to claim portions of Inuit Nunaat as part
of their territories. With the interest in products of animal origin
like whale oil, walrus tusks and fox pelts waned, and the price of such
commodities crashed during the late nineteenth century, this did not
translate into an abandonment of settler colonialism. The colonial
project got a new élan with the discovery of gold in some parts of Inuit
Nunaat. As a commodity, gold had an important role not only as a tool
for economic development, but also played an important role in the
global economy due to the widespread adoption of the gold standard. The
discovery of gold and, later, of oil, constitute the main turn in Arctic
colonialisms. While harvesting or trading baleen with the peoples of the
Arctic offered little room to direct control over space, resources
embedded in the soil, such as gold and oil, demand that territoriality
and property are made clear on site. Moreover, the exploitation of such
resources is, from the standpoint of capital and State, dynamic in the
sense that their exploitation spurs a series of associated economic
activities, seen as a possible remedy for the poverty and deprivation
faced by Arctic communities as well as providing Euro-American settlers
with the products and labour needed to make such activities viable and
profitable.The Arctic resource boom and new Arctic colonialisms In the
turn of the twentieth century, news of the presence of gold in Alaska
and in Chukokta attracted the attention of State, capital and
individuals seeking to make fortune through mining. Demuth stresses how
the commercial extraction of minerals demanded, on the settler side,
enclosure and definition of property rights over land and
underground.13) In different parts of Inuit Nunaat, different
arrangements were made in attempt to define and reinforce borders as
well as seizing the economic opportunity brought about by the knowledge
of gold in the Arctic. In the Russian Empire, for example, gold mining
was seen as an imperial concession rather than a private enterprise,
undertook to secure the imperial bullion reserves. In the U.S, on the
other hand, while gold mining was seen as a matter of private
enterprise, it involved State intervention in defining property rights,
settling disputes and defining which citizens were entitled to the
exploitation of gold mining. Both solutions to the problem of enclosure
and property over land were instrumental in extending the reach of the
State inland. The sea was (at that moment) not liable to
territorialization and the hunting activities over the shore and sea-ice
did not entail long-term settlement opportunities, the need to settle
ownership claims and to stimulate mining activity. The discovery of
gold, and the initial ease with which it could be mined, attracted large
contingents of foreigners to Alaska and crystallized ethnic/racial
divisions within Inuit Nunaat. White foreigners sought fortune on gold
mining, while the Iñupiaq of the region were not only physically
segregated, but also relegated to providing subsistence goods and
services (clothing, reindeer meat, transport) that supported the mining
activity. In Russia, on the other hand, the Empire and then the
Bolsheviks sought to control the flow of gold and resettling populations
from other parts of Russia in the region, seeking to turn gold into the
gravitational centre of Chukokta's economy. For the populations of Inuit
Nunaat, these different solutions meant the same -- enclosure that
sought to separate these peoples from their traditional lands and their
livelihoods, which were redirected by the efforts of States to better
serve settler dominated economic activities. The introduction of
coal-powered dredges and the structuration of corporate mining over the
beginning of the twentieth century14) were responsible for accelerating
these trends. Finally, the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in
the late 1970's closes the gap between what we dubbed the "old"
colonialisms and the "new" ones. In the words of Eben Hopson, one of the
founders of the Inuit Circumpolar Council: Our people, who survived the
fur trade, international whaling, and the gold rush, began being
threatened by the world's oil shortage. The oil discovery at Prudhoe Bay
meant that the European immigrants to America had become rich, highly
industrialised people, and had finally begun to covet our Arctic
land.15) Oil and gas extraction, much like gold mining, are activities
that demand great control over space, not only in the regions where the
extraction occurs, but also in the constitution and maintenance of
logistic corridors. Allowing for movement to and from the producing
regions, connecting them to global markets is fundamental in such
economic activities, which makes land an important asset for State and
capitalist agents involved. Moreover, and, like gold, oil and gas are
deeply enmeshed in global geopolitics, meaning that the development of
hydrocarbon reserves is important for States to achieving their
political and strategic objectives in the global scenario. The mentioned
perception of the coveting of Inuit land, together with the need to
preserve Inuit culture also led to the establishment of the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference, a pan-Arctic Inuit caucus where Inuit rights and
claims were collectively discussed, leading to the founding of the Inuit
Circumpolar Council. Shadian's research details how the 'politics of
oil' articulated Inuit local politics in Canada, Greenland and the U.S
with global issue. The discovery of oil in regions like northern Alaska
and the Arctic in general has been one of the main drivers of
geopolitical interest in the region. There were, however, gaps in
Euro-American awareness about the presence of hydrocarbon reserves in
the region -- a trend reversed by the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal
of 2008. With the publication of the first comprehensive study by the
United States Geological Survey on the resource endowment of the Arctic,
interest in the economic development of the region spiked. It is
estimated that 30% of the world's undiscovered gas reserves and 13% of
the undiscovered oil reserves are in the Arctic.16) The surge in
interest reflects a global trend: the emergence of neo-extractivist
capital accumulation,17) based on increasing pressure over natural goods
and resources and one in which the global extractive frontiers expand,
exerting additional pressures over lands and territories where resource
reserves can be found. The expansion of the global extractive frontier
is directly related to pressure over the traditional lands of Indigenous
peoples, and in tandem with the growing struggle for the recognition of
indigenous rights to self-government. The growing demand for
hydrocarbons and mineral resources potentially can impact all of Inuit
Nunaat, putting the security and economic development of Arctic States
in a collision route with indigenous rights and demands in the region.
DuPlessis also points to how the expansion of the global extractive
frontier is affecting the mobilities and spatialities of the indigenous
peoples of the Arctic.18) Resource development activities and the
discourses that support them are examples of "striation activities",19)
activities through which the modern biopolitical state imposes its
striated spatiality over the smooth spatiality of the nomadic Sámi
people. Transport infrastructure development plays a large role in this
process, since it is one of the ways through which the state occupies a
space and exercise control over it by organising it in points,20) thus
striating it and enabling the government of movement and other
spatialities in the region. Striation activities in the Arctic rely
heavily on the planning and construction of physical infrastructure and
logistic corridors that create the necessary lines connecting strategic
points, not only for the direct objective of enabling economic activity
via circulation but also to seize the strategic advantages given by such
points and such connections. Old colonialisms and the new: legacies,
continuities and further issues While contemporary projects of economic
development in the Arctic have reached new scales and exploit new
resource frontiers, they are closely related to the continuity of 'old'
Arctic colonialisms. In their development, the perpetuation of the
settler-colonial logic of capitalist economic development coupled with
reasons of the Euro-American polities that claim the Arctic as part of
their territory constitute the basis of 'Arctic geopolitics'. Another
new element is the growing importance of the Arctic as a geopolitical
hotspot in world politics. While economic reasons are an important
driver for territorial reorganizations in the Arctic, national security
and defence issues also play an important part in such processes. The
reorganization of military structures and the redefinition of military
strategies and objectives in the Arctic -- seen in Russia, in the US and
Canada, encompassing all of the Inuit homeland -- points to a tendency
of increased control being exercised over hyperborean spaces by States.

The emergence of neo-extractivist capitalist development21) might be the
defining feature of emerging Arctic colonialisms. [Neo-extractivist
**[capital accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [characterized
by]{.underline} pressure over natural resources and the [[demand
for]{.mark} **greater capitalist [control]{.mark}** over
space]{.underline}, [reinforcing a relationship between]{.underline}
[humanity and nature]{.underline} based on the economic value of land
and natural resources. While colonial projects attempt to recast
themselves as necessary [[in the face of **external
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} or as the reasonable way of seizing the
Arctic resource boom, their objectives are similar to those of old
colonialisms: subsume indigenous territories and subjectivities under
the logic of capitalist accumulation and [extending]{.underline} State
(and capital) [control over]{.underline} the [populations]{.underline}
that inhabit them. It is possible to note that, if their scale and
methods are somehow different from eighteenth and nineteenth century

The [[**appropriation** of the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} by
representatives of this Christian culture and mind frame [stands in a
long line of confrontations]{.underline}, literally around the world,
[[with what **colonialists perceived** as
**pristine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**untamed nature** that could be
**appropriated** and **mastered**]{.mark} in new ways]{.underline}.
Frontier landscapes were the [manifestation of **[God's gift]{.mark}**
to humankind]{.underline}, and the [[solution to]{.mark} the
**ever-[increasing needs]{.mark}**]{.underline} of societies for natural
bounty. Men of Western science also played an important role as
missionaries of the Christian faith in conquering the North. As Andrew
Stuhl has argued about later incarnations of these colonizers in Alaska,
" their [concepts and research [practices]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[accompanied efforts to]{.mark} **conquer**]{.underline}, cajole,
civilize, **[[capitalize]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[consume]{.underline}** and conserve [the **far north**]{.underline}
since the late 1800s" (Stuhl, Reference Stuhl2016: 2), and further back
if we consider the European Arctic.
**[[Extractivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as an [extension
of]{.underline} Man's [God-given right to utilize the planet's
resources]{.underline}, was [[**deeply embedded** in]{.mark} the
[rationale for a **push to the north**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as an
expression of the century-old endeavor to "[[find]{.mark} the world's
remaining **[unclaimed lands]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Stuhl, Reference
Stuhl2016: 3).

More recent and more secular ideas about land and resources followed
that underlay colonial extractivist philosophy in the broadest possible
traditions of political theory: Locke on labor, property, and the ethics
of resource appropriation; Marx on labor, transformation of nature, and
existential freedom. The ethical and philosophical foundations of
[[extractivism]{.underline}]{.mark} are found [in the [**very core**
of]{.mark} Western ideas of [modernity]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
Arctic is no exception. Over time, they [[**coalesced** into]{.mark}
**broad [developmental narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline} that became
embedded in extractivist thought, in the physical domination of
landscapes and its riches, and in the relations to the people who
inhabited it (Bridge, Reference Bridge2009; Richardson & Weszkalnys,
Reference Richardson and Weszkalnys2014).

imperialists race to grab the loot,"

AA\]

[Trump is eyeing Greenland, Putin is strengthening Russia's base on the
archipelago of Svalbard, all the while embarking on new joint ventures
with China in the Arctic region at large. The [world\'s top]{.mark}
**[imperialist]{.mark}** powers are [vying]{.mark} to strengthen their
positions in the [Arctic]{.mark}, elbowing weaker nations
aside]{.underline}. With global warming melting the North Polar ice cap,
[the [**scramble** for]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} has
[begun]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Arctic has long been a region of military-strategic importance.
During the Cold War, both the US and the Soviet Union saw it as a key
battleground, as the Arctic has the shortest flight path for potential
missiles between US and Russian territory.

Now, with rising tensions between the imperialist powers and global
warming opening up new profitable avenues of trade and plunder, the
interests of the main imperialist powers in the Arctic are reaching a
higher level than ever before. As Leif Terje Aunevik, the mayor of
Longyearbyen on Svalbard, told the BBC in May, "I think the world has
been gripped by Arctic fomo \[fear of missing out\]."

The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the
globe since 1979. Scientists have predicted that the Arctic Ocean could
be ice-free by summer 2050, or even as early as 2035. As the melting
periods become longer, global warming increases faster, since the darker
areas of thinner ice and open sea water absorb more sunlight, trapping
heat in the atmosphere.

For ordinary people, this will spell disaster: higher sea levels will
flood coastal cities and eventually drown whole island nations.
Catastrophic weather events will become more frequent, and whole
ecosystems will be endangered.

But for the [**[capitalists]{.mark}**, [ice-free]{.mark} Arctic
[waters]{.mark}, [thawing permafrost]{.mark} and disappearing glaciers
mean something else entirely. The [prospect of]{.mark} accessible
[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}ineral[s]{.mark}, [untapped oil
and gas]{.mark} deposits, [and new fishing areas]{.mark} means that
there is [money to be made]{.mark}. New [shipping lanes]{.mark} in
ice-free waters are a particularly [attractive prospect]{.mark} for
[freight monopolies]{.mark} to [exploit]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Hence [Trump\'s interest in Greenland]{.mark}, [home to]{.mark} 25 of
34 critical raw [materials]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence the growing
tensions over the Polar region.

In 2021, the [US [Army]{.mark} published a new Arctic
strategy titled *Regaining Arctic Dominance*, [argu]{.mark}ing that the
[US must]{.mark} "organize to [win in the Arctic]{.mark}," that the
region is "an [arena]{.mark} of competition, a line of attack in
conflict, a vital area holding many... natural [resources]{.mark}, and a
platform for **[global power projection]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

[Similar [statements]{.mark} have been made, not just [by]{.mark} bigger
players like [China]{.mark} and [Russia]{.mark}, but also by [Arctic
countries]{.mark} like Norway and Canada. Canada stated in 2019 that
"the Arctic region is of critical importance to the national security
and defence of Canada" and vowed to take steps to "increase its Arctic
and Northern footprint in support of regional safety and
security.]{.underline}" In 2025, they announced their aim to have
"military presence in the region on a near permanent basis."

In 2020, Norway\'s Defence Ministry stated that "If Norway does not have
a regular and predictable presence in the North, a space could open for
allies or others to fill... Such a development could have negative
consequences for stability and Norway might lose influence on the
security development in its own neighbourhood."

Military exercises in the Arctic have increased substantially in the
last ten years. NATO doubled Arctic military activities from 2015 to
2020. At the same time, Russia has assigned at least 81 percent of its
nuclear weapons to its Northern Fleet.

[[We live in]{.mark} the]{.underline} age of
**[[polycrisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or permacrisis), [[characterised
by]{.mark} the combination of **[long-term]{.mark}**,
**[complex]{.mark}** [and **intertwined** risks]{.mark}]{.underline}
related, inter alia, to health, energy, climate change and economic
shocks. It has become evident that new imaginaries, practices and
knowledge about human-nature relations are necessary to cope with this
situation. When it comes to international politics and governance, there
is no doubt that the current global order has failed to offer efficient
governance frameworks that would ensure planetary resilience. Six of the
nine [planetary boundaries have been **exceeded**]{.underline}. To
prevent the looming ecocrisis and guarantee the continued survival of
humanity, Anthony Burke and colleagues have famously urged that,
"[Planet\[ary\] [politics must **emerge** as]{.mark} an
**[alternative]{.mark} thought** and **process**: a politics [to
**nurture**]{.mark} **worlds**]{.underline} [[for **all**]{.mark} humans
and species **[co-living]{.mark}** in the biosphere]{.underline}."

Although the Arctic is often viewed as a showcase of ongoing global
climate change, [[research on Arctic]{.mark} politics and governance
[tends to be **very state-centric**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It often
[[overlooks]{.mark} how [**non-state actors** and **non-human
agents**]{.mark} shape those processes]{.underline}. This new series
explores more-than-human aspects and actors in the Arctic to challenge
traditional human-centric starting points of Arctic politics and
governance. It raises critical questions, such as: How would Arctic
politics and governance look from a more-than-human and multi-species
point of view? What kind of agency does the melting sea ice have in
Arctic politics? How could we better incorporate the needs of
more-than-humans in Arctic policy debates?

The Arctic Institute's Planetary Series 2025 is a part of our ongoing
project that proposes a new paradigm for world politics: the
Planetocene, which emphasizes that all forms of life -- including
humankind -- are dependent on the well-being of nature. Planetocene is a
normative concept for envisioning a desirable future epoch. The series
will be running until spring 2025.

[**Planetary approach** to politics and governance]{.underline}

As claimed by Jason Moore in 2016, [we live in the
**[Capitalocene]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the **age of
capital**]{.underline}, in which [capitalism]{.underline} does not only
organize the global political and economic order but also [**[profoundly
shapes]{.mark}** how [nature]{.mark} is being valued and
organized]{.underline}. Since this state of affairs has led to
intensifying ecological crises globally, many social scientists have
sought inspiration from natural sciences. Especially the concept of
Anthropocene, adopted from geology, has gained popularity as a valuable
narrative to conceptualize the human-nature relationships and articulate
political agendas to decrease the environmental harm of human conduct at
a global level.

Yet, the Anthropocene, like its sibling Capitalocene, has also been
[[criticized due]{.mark} to its **[human-centric
ontology]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**technocratic belief** in **future
solutions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **ignorance**]{.mark} of the
role of economics in causing environmental crises]{.underline}. As the
recently emerged lively academic debate about planetary politics and the
rights of nature demonstrates, new kinds of ecological imaginaries about
the relationship between humanity and the rest of nature are urgently
needed to induce fundamental changes in our political and economic
systems. However, this task looks overwhelming in the current world
dominated by capitalism and Realpolitik -- dynamics that have also
turned the Arctic into the focus of international policy debates and
strategies.

It is hardly surprising that the [[bulk of Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
political and legal [[studies view the Arctic in]{.mark} terms of
**sovereignty** and **territoriality**]{.underline}. Similarly,
[political and legal maps and discussions]{.underline} of the Arctic
Ocean [divide the ocean into **internal** and **territorial waters**,
coastal states' **e**xclusive **e**conomic **z**one**s**, and **high
seas**, and the seafloor into partly **overlapping claims** for extended
continental shelves made by the littoral states, and seabed beyond any
state's continental shelf]{.underline}. In such discourses, [**[no
attention]{.mark}** is paid [to the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[unique
features of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Arctic marine
**[ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**more-than-human**
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[pluriversal
ontologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[or
**imaginaries**]{.underline}]{.mark} and (traditional) ways of life of
the many communities, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, living on the
Arctic Ocean coast.

Unsurprisingly then, meaningful action on tackling climate change is
nowhere on the political agenda.

Drilling to Oblivion

Around the same time that a record low in Arctic sea ice was being
recorded, a new report from the UK's House of Commons Environmental
Audit Committee urged a halt to all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic,
at least "until new safeguards are put in place." Committee chair Joan
Walley MP said:

[The [shocking speed]{.mark} at which the Arctic [sea ice]{.mark} is
[melting]{.mark} should be a [wake-up call]{.mark} to the world that we
need [to phase out fossil fuels]{.mark} fast. Instead we are witnessing
a [reckless **gold rush**]{.mark} in this pristine wilderness as big
companies and [governments make]{.mark} a [grab for]{.mark} the world's
last untapped oil and gas [reserves]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Caroline Lewis, member of the committee, warned that "[[the race to
carve up]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} is accelerating [faster
than]{.mark} our regulatory or technical **[capacity]{.mark}** to manage
it."]{.underline}

B[ut the record of **[corporate capitalism]{.mark}** shows that powerful
industrial [forces]{.mark} will do all they can to [lobby]{.mark}
governments [to allo]{.mark}w for continued economic
[exploitation]{.mark} of the planet's resources]{.underline}. According
to the US Geological Survey, within the Arctic Circle there are some 90
billion barrels of oil -- 13 per cent of the planet's undiscovered oil
reserves -- and 30 per cent of its undiscovered natural gas[. The
[race]{.mark} for corporate profits [is]{.mark} now [on]{.mark}, with
[Shell]{.mark} already [committed]{.mark} to a "multi-year exploration
program" in the Arctic.]{.underline}

The [[receding]{.mark} Arctic [ice]{.mark} is a "[business
opportunity]{.mark}" for those wishing to exploit newly available
shipping routes]{.underline}. Cargo that now goes via the Panama Canal
or the Suez Canal will, in many cases, have a shorter Arctic route,
ensuring "efficiency savings" for big business.

Companies are also licking their lips at the prospect at getting their
hands on [vast deposits]{.mark} of minerals as Greenland's ice cap
recedes.

["For me, I [wouldn't mind if]{.mark} the [whole ice cap
disappears]{.mark}," said Ole Christiansen, the chief executive of
NunamMinerals, Greenland's largest homegrown mining company, with his
eyes on a proposed gold mining site up the fjord from Nuuk, Greenland's
capital. "As it melts, we're seeing new places with very attractive
geology."]{.underline}

[Conservationists]{.underline}, ecologists and environmentalists
[**successfully changed** public perception and government policy in the
1960s and 70s on a range of issues]{.underline}---environmental
protection, pollution, endangered species---[to become a **major
threat** to **business interests** by the 1980s, leading to a sustained,
especially corporate sponsored, backlash]{.underline}. For example, in
the United States of America (USA), the multi-billionaire Koch brothers
have for decades run the corporate conglomerate Koch Industries, which
profits by being one of the nation\'s most polluting companies
(impacting land, air and water) and has used political influence to
craft the Republican anti-regulatory agenda (Dickinson, 2014). [In the
face of **increasingly widespread recognition** of the costs competitive
[business]{.mark} enterprises shift on to others]{.underline} (both
human and non-human, present and future) [a broad [strategy]{.mark} has
been to [undermine]{.mark} the science and scientists supporting direct
[environmental regulation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Oreskes and Conway,
2010), [while **[substituting corporate led
alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Conservation is,]{.underline}
indeed, merely [[one example of]{.mark} a much larger on-going
[struggle]{.mark} for environmental regulation [against the]{.mark}
**interests of [wealthy elite]{.mark}s** [and **capital
accumulati**]{.mark}]{.underline}ng
organisati**[[on]{.underline}]{.mark}**s.

A decade ago this surfaced as an open fight between traditional and
'new' conservation, as highlighted by a special section in Biological
Conservation (Miller et al., 2011; Minteer and Miller, 2011). Today what
was advocated may seem of doubtful relevance to conservationists, not
least because some of the key protagonist (e.g. Peter Kareiva, Marc
Tercek) have disappeared from the conservation community\'s limelight.
However, as I will argue, this dispute evidences the 'open conspiracy'
of a corporate takeover of conservation, its highest profile
environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs) and
neoliberalisation of government policy on biodiversity and Nature
protection. Contrary to some recent claims, that there are "no distinct
camps within the conservation community" (Sandbrook et al., 2019: 320),
[**[fundamental divisions]{.mark}** in conservation [exist concerning
the role of]{.mark} the **currently [hegemonic economic
systems]{.mark}**[, including whether to ally with]{.mark} or oppose
major [corporations]{.mark}, [capitalism]{.mark}, in its various forms,
and market mechanisms]{.underline}. However, I will also argue that the
central conflict in conservation of concern here is poorly understood by
simplistic antagonistic positions that seem to abound as dichotomies in
the literature: the anthropocentric vs. ecocentric; human utility vs
non-human intrinsic value; poverty alleviation vs wildlife protection;
indigenous autonomy vs international imperialism; sustainable
development vs. wilderness. [Conducting debates over conservation policy
in such 'either/or' terms too easily becomes a **rhetorical exercise**
losing track of the **substantive social and economic mechanisms**
[caus]{.mark}ing **[both human exploitation and species
loss]{.mark}**]{.underline}, social depravation and mass extinction.
[The link between the actual forces causing Nature to be corrupted,
dominated and destroyed are treated as if **divorced** from the forces
causing suffering and exploitation of humans.]{.underline}

[[New conservation]{.mark} played directly on the oppositional
rhetorical framing of conservation as **dichotomously divided**. Its
advocates put it forward [as **pragmatic** and serving the]{.mark}
**ends of [people]{.mark}** within existing economic
structures]{.underline}, where [corporate [capitalism was]{.mark}
designated as [progressive, while]{.mark} [characterising traditional
conservation as **backward looking**]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on
building fortress parks against traditional land users and showing total
disregard for the poor (Kareiva and Marvier, 2012; Kareiva et al.,
2012). Conservation needed to become socially concerned, pro-people and
support economic development. In response, the new conservationists were
criticised for painting a picture of "nature protection for its own sake
\[as\] a dysfunctional, antihuman anachronism" (Soulé, 2013: 895). The
dispute was popularly summarised as 'people vs. parks', and this
metaphorical caricature remains present in current debates over
restricting human intervention into Nature, e.g. proposals such
as Watson et al. (2018) to protect all remaining intact ecosystems from
economic development or 'Nature needs half' (see response to criticisms
by Crist et al., 2021). Conservation is then seen as facing the stark
choice of either being pro-human, supporting progress as a form of
sustained development (i.e. inclusive economic growth), or anti-human,
seeking to enforce the removal of mankind from Nature.

[The new conservation [critique picked-up on **real concerns**
over]{.mark} the historical development of conservation and [how]{.mark}
control of [land use can]{.mark}]{.underline} (under specific
institutional conditions) [[harm innocent people]{.mark}. However, it
[failed to place expropriation]{.mark}, land grabbing and violation of
indigenous peoples\' human rights [in its **social and political
context**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[racism, patriarchy, materialism,
[imperialism and colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Practices of
exploitation]{.mark} were **never unique** to conservation, and [remain
**institutionalised** in how]{.mark} economic organisations and nation
[states]{.mark} operate to **accumulate resources**, **control supply
chains** and **[maintain economic growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
historical context, such unethical conservation practice would then
appear as nothing more than a small part of a general political and
economic structure. However, the [new conservationists\' rhetoric
quickly moved to **tarring all past conservation**, and those who might
advocated anything from the past, with the same brush, while ignoring
the **actual mechanisms**, institutions and causes of ongoing social
injustice and **ecological destruction**]{.underline}.

In what follows, I seek to clarify some key aspects of the conflicting
positions, in and around conservation practice and policy, that have
become evident in recent times. I start by reviewing the position termed
traditional conservation and the challenges it faces. I then move more
specifically to critically appraise new conservation. This raises the
issue of the relationship between conservation and economic development,
which is revealed to be a long standing tension rather than something
new. The occurrence of new conservation is argued to represent the
ongoing intensification in society of seeking to sustain economic growth
by capturing value from Nature. Conservation as a social movement is
then shown to have become partially co-opted into neoliberal capitalism
by corporate interests, while biodiversity (and related) policy is
increasingly being embedded in the world of finance. [This [raises the
question of how conservationists expect to achieve protection for
Nature]{.mark} and ethical treatment of non-humans [without **radical
transformation** of **current economic systems**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Recognising where the value conflicts **really lie** is necessary to
address how conservation should **move forward** in the 22nd
Century]{.underline}.

homogeneous and to be [measured in terms of]{.mark} the [**single
yardstick** of exchange value]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this respect, it
is crucial to remember that [[capitalism]{.mark} is a system of
accumulation geared to **exponential expansion**, hence leading to the
drawing down of natural resources. It [represents the **very opposite of
conservation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It therefore **cannot accept**
material limits or boundaries, which are viewed simply as **barriers to
be surmounted**]{.underline}.87 [[Faced with]{.mark} environmental
[constraints]{.mark}, the [dominant economic approach
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore, [[to incorporate]{.mark} ecosystem
services into the economy by **placing capital values on it** and
selectively integrating [it with **capital accumulation**
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}---[a process [made easier by the
fact]{.mark} that [capital makes nature]{.mark} **scarcer** and [**more
marketable** by **destroying** it]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Valuing nature
simply by its ecosystem services to a capitalist economy is **inevitably
destructive of nature itself**]{.underline}, with the concept of
ecosystem services inviting the extreme division of nature in capitalist
terms, since it has as its initial basis the "cutting" of nature into
discrete pieces to be valorized.88

[In the context of the overall financialization of the world economy,
vast amounts of surplus "free cash," the growth of financial
bubbles]{.underline}, and the promotion of debt peonage in the Global
South, [the [financialization of nature is likely to
**intensify**]{.mark} **the [volatility]{.mark}** [of the **capitalist
economy**]{.mark} itself]{.underline}.89 [Nevertheless, it is the
environmental bubble generated by the financialization of nature that is
most dangerous]{.underline}.90

In what amounts to a victory of notions of weak sustainability, [it is
[often contended]{.mark} that the continual [destruction]{.mark} of
nature required by capital accumulation [can be offset by the
**valorization**]{.mark} **of nature** and its **internalization**
within the **logic of capital** itself, [so that there is no net loss of
natural capital]{.mark}]{.underline} in economic value terms and the
exponential increase of capital accumulation in a limited environment is
allowed to proceed. New financialized ecosystems can help support the
entire system. [If nature is itself capital, the argument goes, there is
simply no problem. The destruction of one species or of a whole
ecosystem can be **compensated for** by natural capital that provides
ecosystem services for the economy **elsewhere**]{.underline}. In the
words of Solow, representing the neoclassical view of sustainability,

History tells us an important fact, namely that goods and services can
be substituted for one another. If you don't eat one species of fish,
you can eat another species of fish. Resources are, to use a favorite
word of economists, fungible in a certain sense. They can take the place
of each other. That is extremely important because it suggests that we
do not owe to the future any particular thing. There is no specific
object that the goal of sustainability, the obligation of
sustainability, requires us to leave untouched.... Sustainability
doesn't require that any particular species of fish or
any particular tract of forest be preserved.91

[Like most [capitalist economists]{.mark}, Solow [fail]{.mark}s [to
recognize]{.mark} that [each species and]{.mark} each [ecosystem is
**unique**]{.mark}, and that [extinction is **irreversible**, affecting
the whole]{.mark} **complex evolution** of the [Earth]{.mark}
System]{.underline}. For Credit Suisse, [conservation finance is about
turning [nature]{.mark} into "fungible" cash flow and
products]{.underline} in precisely Solow's sense.92 [Species and
ecosystems [may be treated as]{.mark} **commensurable** and
**[substitutable]{.mark}** in the economic value terms of the capitalist
economy, but [in reality they are]{.mark} **incommensurable** and
**[irreplaceable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Their individual demise
represents real ecological consequences]{.underline}. [To think
otherwise is to fall prey to]{.underline} what Marxist geographer David
Harvey called "the ~~madness~~ of [economic reason]{.underline}," in
which there are no limits---quantitative or qualitative---to the
valorization and financialization of capital, conceived as value in
motion, absorbing all of reality, including nature itself.93

[[Security **cooperation** with Russia]{.mark}'s newest mercenary
invention is a [recipe for trouble]{.mark} for new [partner
states]{.mark} and their populations]{.underline}. Deals with Russian
private military companies exacerbate the [terro]{.mark}rist threat in
the Sahel and further erode any semblance of civil-military norms,
however fleeting they may have been.

[[Moscow's offering]{.mark}s --- a concoction of private military
companies, cheap weapons, and regime protection --- are laying the
[groundwork for]{.mark} enduring [insecurity]{.mark} that will only
[benefit Russia]{.mark} in the long run. Besides creating a demand and
[dependency for Russian boots]{.mark} on the ground, Moscow's
[**mercenary** diplomacy]{.mark} creates new opportunities and [new
**markets** for]{.mark} Russia's broader [defense industrial
base]{.mark}. They lay the foundation for Russia's weapons industry, an
industry that has dwindled in the lead-up to and since the invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. Whether supplying Africa Corps or selling/donating
defense articles to African clients, Moscow's military-industrial base
stands to benefit from enduring insecurity in Africa and beyond.

Over the past several months, the United States has been forced out of a
long-standing security mission in Niger, while the status of American
troops in Chad remains an open question. As Nathan Powell recently
argued in these pages, Washington has certainly made its share of
mistakes in dealing with its African partners. Niger's prime minister
suggested as much in a recent interview.

[But [Russia]{.mark} has also played a savvy game, [selling itself
as]{.mark} an important [security partner]{.mark} ready to
[**capitalize** on Washington's]{.mark} real, or perceived,
[shortcomings]{.mark}]{.underline}. African leaders see more viable, and
arguably more pragmatic, security alternatives today than in years past.
And new military juntas have been more emboldened to gamble on new
partners rather than stick with the status quo. Russia has also
exploited anti-French sentiment, alongside America's real and perceived
ties to France. [[Democratic values]{.mark} and norms are easily [linked
to **neocolonialism**]{.mark} and [capitalism by]{.mark} the [Kremlin's
disinformation]{.mark} cyber [army]{.mark}. Russia's opportunism and
[exploitation of]{.mark} the [fractures in relations]{.mark} between the
West and several African states [build **legitimacy**]{.mark} for Moscow
despite Russian mercenaries' mixed record.]{.underline}

Against that backdrop, Washington should be prepared to implement a
patient and multifaceted response. U.S. policymakers should not abandon
military support altogether, but they should recognize that military
tools are only a piece of the strategic solution. Isolating juntas and
lecturing Africans on their security partners only play into Moscow's
hands. Instead, Washington should also recognize that in the near and
mid-term, learning to coexist with Moscow and Beijing is a necessity. In
doing so, however, the United States must prove to African governments
that Washington is a worthy and reliable partner --- the partner of
choice across all sectors from security to economic. [At the same time,
[Washington]{.mark} should continue to [expose Russia]{.mark}n private
[military]{.mark} companies as [chaotic enforcers of insecurity]{.mark},
emphasizing Moscow's underwhelming investment on the continent,
enhancing diplomatic engagement, and delivering on promises of economic
investment.]{.underline}

#### Domain awareness in the Arctic acts as a capitalist tool to enforce existing power structures

Science from York University "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical
imaginaries of security in the Canadian Arctic" January 21 2024,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2024.2304413 //vo)

[Time and space are the twin axes of sovereign control for which **[the
state is working to extend]{.mark} its [power]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} more
networked, layered, and **[technological]{.mark}ly intensive
[ways]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These efforts mirror Foucault's
theorisation of the Panopticon, which represents an idea or 'the oldest
dream of the oldest sovereign: None of my subjects can escape and none
of their actions is unknown to me.The central point of the Panopticon
still functions, as it were, as a perfect sovereign' (Foucault
Citation2007, 66). The technology and materiality of the Panopticon and
surveillance are generally more than the sum of a pre-ordained need (to
discipline and punish). Instead, [they are **[entwined within]{.mark}
the production of** intersecting and overlapping discourses and other
**semiotic [tools that organise space]{.mark}** and bodies **while
[reproducing]{.mark}** segments of **[power]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Following this insight, this paper asks: why has
[**[developing]{.mark}** and using **[sensing technology]{.mark} [in the
Arctic become]{.mark}** a key focus]{.underline} of the Canadian
government? For the Arctic, thinking about technological development
strictly in conventional and instrumental terms does not offer a
complete account of how and why sensing technology has become a key
focus of development by the Canadian Federal Government within its
approach to Arctic security.

This paper demonstrates how **[[sociotechnical
imaginaries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, constructed through layers of
meaning and representation in discourse and other semiotic structures,
are entangled with scientific research and technological development.
Specifically, this paper considers how sociotechnical imaginaries
[**[structure]{.mark}** the **[development]{.mark}** and use **[of
sensing technology for security]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Canadian
Arctic.The central claim of this paper is that [these technological
developments are grounded in a particular sociotechnical imaginary
**[centred on risk]{.mark}, possibility, [and
vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which frames the Arctic as a space
threatened by myriad future dangers. Broadly, this paper demonstrates
that the New Arctic functions as a productive sociotechnical imaginary
concerning the innovation of security technologies designed to make a
spectrum of future threats visible and manageable in the present.

This article makes a novel contribution in three key ways. First,
academic and policy attention to Arctic security within Canada and
abroad has been reignited in recent years, especially following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, given its effects on Arctic governance efforts in
the international sphere. However, this focus has primarily been within
a policy-oriented rationalist lens, particularly within the Canadian
context. Specifically, [recent geostrategic interest in Arctic security
has deliberated on the potential for interstate conflict in the region
between Russia and western Arctic states (which in some ways is
reminiscent of Cold War concerns) while questioning the endurance of
Arctic governance structures]{.underline} like the Arctic Council and
the region's inherent stability as an exceptional zone of peace. Second,
Critical Security Studies (CSS) has primarily focused on the issues of
climate change and human security concerning the Arctic. [While there
are notable interventions theoretically interrogating Arctic security in
policy and discourse]{.underline} (e.g. Salter Citation2019; Sejersen
Citation2021), [**[sensing technology has]{.mark}** only recently
**[begun to be examined through]{.mark}** a more comprehensive and
**[critical lens]{.mark}**]{.underline} despite the prevalence of
technology and surveillance-focused research in CSS (see Johnson
Citation2021). Lastly, while the relationship between sovereignty and
security is a well-worn subject within the Canadian Arctic literature,
this study contributes a novel approach to analysing how [**[sovereignty
is]{.mark}** rhetorically and materially **[invoked through]{.mark}**
sociotechnical **[imaginaries of Arctic
(in)security]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Empirically, the paper draws from multiple discrete sources to form a
cohesive demonstration of the Arctic's historical and contemporary
representation. The paper draws from articles in the Globe and Mail
newspaper to demonstrate how the Arctic was portrayed as a frontier
space to be tamed by science and technological intervention in the early
20th century while illustrating conceptual lines of similarity between
that era, the Cold War, and contemporary Arctic security efforts. While
media representations are not a substitute for policy, they offer a
window into the contours of earlier Arctic imaginaries. The paper also
draws from official Government of Canada policy reports and frameworks,
along with public reports in the defence research and industry sphere
and advertising by firms involved in the production of sensing
technologies, specifically the Canadian firm MDA Inc.

This paper is organised as follows. It begins with a conceptual
discussion of sociotechnical imaginaries and draws from the work of
Sheila Jasanoff and others to illustrate their usefulness as a lens to
examine Arctic security and its link to sovereignty in Canada. While
linking and contrasting these earlier imaginaries, the paper highlights
the work of Chartier (Citation2018) and his conceptualisation of the
imagined North. [The paper builds on the imagined North by demonstrating
how the region is imagined as a futurized space vulnerable to a complex
network of global forces within the New Arctic]{.underline}, which is a
term variably used to capture recent significant and likely enduring
changes in the Arctic's natural and political environments.
Subsequently, the paper discusses how [the New Arctic is premised on a
specific ontology of deterritorialisation, relationality, and
complexity. This ontology is primarily approached within Arctic security
practices through an epistemic framework of risk, vulnerability, and
probability, which are relational and directly linked to sensing
practices]{.underline}. This section is broken into three sub-sections
to discuss how each relationship serves the dominant sociotechnical
imaginary underlying the New Arctic and its interaction with sensing
technology in the space and marine domains.

[**[The Arctic's]{.mark}** dominant cultural, social, and **[political
understandings are part of]{.mark}** a broader set of
**[discourses]{.mark} and epistemic practices [that shape the
region]{.mark}** as a material space]{.underline}. This paper draws on
Jasanoff's (Citation2015) understanding of sociotechnical imaginaries to
analyse the Canadian Arctic and **[[situate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Canada's [focus on developing sensing technologies for Arctic
**[situational awareness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

To see why, we must revisit the concept of capitalism. Contrary to the
usual view, [capitalism is **not an economic system**]{.underline} but
something bigger. More than a way of organizing economic production and
exchange, [it is]{.underline} also [a way of organizing the relation of
production and exchange to]{.underline} [the]{.underline}ir
[non-economic conditions of possibility]{.underline}. It is well
understood in many quarters that [[capitalist societies institutionalize
a]{.mark}]{.underline} dedicated 'economic' realm---the [[realm
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a peculiar [**[abstraction]{.mark}** [known as
'**value'**]{.mark}]{.underline}---where commodities are produced
through privately owned means of production by exploited wage labourers
and sold on price-setting markets by private firms, all with the aim of
generating profits and accumulating capital. What is often overlooked,
however, is that [this realm is **constitutively
dependent**]{.underline}---one could say, parasitic---[on a host
of]{.underline} social [activities]{.underline}, political capacities,
[and]{.underline} natural [processes]{.underline} that are
[defined]{.underline} in capitalist societies [as
non-economic]{.underline}. Accorded no 'value' and positioned outside
it, these constitute the economy's indispensable presuppositions.
Certainly, commodity [production is [inconceivable
without]{.mark}]{.underline} the unwaged activities of social
reproduction that form and sustain the human beings who perform wage
labour. Nor could such production exist apart from the natural processes
that assure availability of vital inputs, including [[raw materials
and]{.underline}]{.mark} sources of [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Neither, finally, would profit or capital be possible without the legal
orders, repressive forces and public goods that underpin private
property and contractual exchange. Essential conditions for a capitalist
economy, these [[non-economic instances are not external]{.mark} to
capitalism, [but integral]{.mark} elements of it. Conceptions of
capitalism that omit them are ideological]{.underline}. [To equate
capitalism with its economy is to parrot the system's own **economistic
self-understanding**---and thus to miss the chance to interrogate it
critically]{.underline}. To gain a critical perspective, we must
understand capitalism broadly---as an institutionalized social order
that encompasses not only the economy but also those activities,
relations and processes, defined as 'non-economic', that make 'the
economy' possible.

What is gained from this revision is the ability to [examine something
crucial: [the relation]{.mark} established in capitalist societies
[between the economy and]{.mark}]{.underline} its 'others'---including
[[that **vital other known as nature**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At its
core, [this relation [is contradictory]{.mark} and
crisis-prone]{.underline}. On the one hand, [the system's]{.underline}
economy is constitutively [dependent on nature]{.underline}, both [as a
tap for]{.underline} production's [inputs and as a sink for]{.underline}
disposing its [waste]{.underline}. At the same time, [capitalist society
institutes a stark division between the two
'realms']{.underline}---constructing the economy as a field of creative
human action that generates value while [positioning ['nature'
as]{.mark} a realm of stuff, **devoid of value, but [infinitely
self-replenishing]{.mark}** and generally available to be processed [in
**commodity production**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This ontological gulf [becomes a]{.mark} raging inferno when capital
enters]{.underline} the mix. [A **[monetized abstraction]{.mark}**
engineered to self-expand, capital commands accumulation without
end]{.underline}. The effect is to incentivize owners [bent on
maximizing profits to commandeer nature's gifts as cheaply as
possible]{.underline}, while also absolving them of any obligation to
replenish what they take and repair what they damage. The **[damages are
the flip-side of the profits]{.underline}**. With their
ecological-reproduction costs discounted, all the major inputs to
capitalist production and circulation are vastly cheapened---not 'just'
raw materials, energy and transport, but also labour, as wages fall with
the cost of living when capital wrests food from nature on the cheap. In
every case, capitalists appropriate the savings from cheap inputs in the
form of profit, while passing the environmental costs to those who must
live with---and die from---the fallout, including future generations.

[More than a relation to labour]{.underline}, then, [[capital
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a relation to
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}---[a]{.underline} predatory, [**extractive**
relation]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} [consumes]{.mark}]{.underline}
ever more [[biophysical]{.mark} wealth]{.underline} in order [to pile
up]{.underline} ever more '[[value']{.underline}]{.mark}, [[while
**disavowing ecological 'externalities'**]{.underline}]{.mark}. What
also piles up, not accidentally, is an ever-growing mountain of
eco-wreckage: an atmosphere flooded by carbon emissions; climbing
temperatures, crumbling polar ice shelves, rising seas clogged with
islands of plastic; mass extinctions, declining biodiversity,
climate-driven migration of organisms and pathogens, increased zoonotic
spillovers of deadly viruses; superstorms, megadroughts, giant locust
swarms, jumbo wildfires, titanic flooding; dead zones, poisoned lands,
unbreathable air. Systemically primed to free-ride on a nature that
cannot really self-replenish without limit, [capitalism's economy is
always on the verge of **destabilizing its own ecological conditions**
of possibility]{.underline}.

[[Here]{.underline}]{.mark}, in effect, [[is an ecological contradiction
lodged at the **heart** of capitalist
society]{.underline}]{.mark}-----[the relation this society establishes
between economy and nature]{.underline}. Grounded deep in the system's
structure, this contradiction is encapsulated in four D-words:
dependence, division, disavowal and destabilization. In a nutshell:
[[capitalist society]{.mark} makes 'economy' depend on
'nature']{.underline}, [while dividing them ontologically]{.underline}.
Enjoining endless [accumulation of value]{.underline}, [while defining
nature as not partaking of]{.underline} it, this arrangement
[[**programmes economy** to disavow the ecological reproduction costs it
generates]{.underline}.]{.mark} The effect, as those costs mount
exponentially, is [to destabilize ecosystems]{.underline}---and,
periodically, to disrupt the entire jerry-rigged edifice of capitalist
society. [[Simultaneously needing and rubbishing
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}, capitalism is a cannibal that devours its
own vital organs, [like a serpent that eats its own tail]{.underline}.

The contradiction can also be formulated in terms of class power. By
definition, capitalist societies devolve the task of organizing
production to capital, or rather, to those dedicated to its
accumulation. It is the class of capitalists whom this system licenses
to extract raw materials, generate energy, determine land use, engineer
food systems, bio-prospect medicinals and dispose of waste---effectively
ceding to them the lion's share of control over air and water, soil and
minerals, flora and fauna, forests and oceans, atmosphere and climate,
which is to say, over all the basic conditions that sustain life on
Earth. [Capitalist society thus vests a class that is strongly motivated
to trash nature with the power to manage our relations with
it]{.underline}.

Granted, [[governments]{.mark} sometimes [intervene]{.mark} post hoc [to
mitigate]{.mark} the [damages]{.mark}]{.underline}---but always
reactively, in the mode of catch-up, and [[without disturbing]{.mark}
the owners' [prerogatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because [[they are
**always a step behind**]{.underline}]{.mark} the emitters of greenhouse
gases, environmental regulations are easily subverted by corporate
workarounds. And [[because they leave intact]{.mark} the structural
divisions that license private firms to organize production, **they do
not alter the fundamental fact**]{.underline}: [[the]{.mark} system
gives capitalists]{.underline} motive, means and [[opportunity to savage
the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is they, and not humans in general,
who have brought us global warming---but not by chance or simple greed.
Rather, [the dynamic that has governed their actions and led to that
outcome is **[baked into the very structure of capitalist
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

Whichever formulation we start with, [the conclusion]{.underline} we
reach [is the same:]{.underline} [[capitalistically organized societies
carry an **ecological contradiction in their dna**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
They are [[primed to precipitate 'natural
catastrophes']{.underline}]{.mark}, which occur periodically but not
accidentally throughout their history. Thus, these [societies harbour a
built-in tendency to ecological crisis]{.underline}. [They generate
ecosystemic vulnerabilities]{.underline} on an ongoing basis, [[as
part]{.mark} and parcel [of their modus operandi]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although not always acute or even apparent, the vulnerabilities pile up
over time, until a tipping point is reached and the damage bursts forth
into view. I shall consider some historical examples in the following
section.

Here, however, I have been stressing the structural character of this
[tendency]{.underline}. The point is all-important, not least for its
practical entailments. [To say that capitalism's ecological problem is
structural is to say that [**we cannot save the planet** without]{.mark}
disabling]{.underline} some core, defining features of [our social
order]{.underline}. [What is needed]{.underline}, first and foremost,
[is to wrest]{.underline} the power to dictate [our relation to nature
away from the class that]{.underline} currently [monopolizes it, so that
we can begin to **reinvent that relation from the ground
up**]{.underline}. But [that **requires [dismantling the
system]{.mark}** [that underpins their power:]{.mark} the
military]{.underline} forces [and property]{.underline} forms,
[the]{.underline} pernicious [ontology of 'value']{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the relentless dynamic of [accumulation]{.underline},
all of which work together to drive global warming. Eco-[[politics
must]{.underline}]{.mark}, in sum, [[be
anti-capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Geoengineering is a]{.mark}n attempt to solve]{.underline} the problem
of [climate change---a **social**, **political**, and **ecological
crisis**---through large-scale tech]{.underline}nological
[projects]{.underline}. This ["**[technofix]{.mark}" mentality** lends
itself to a **systematic [disregard]{.mark}** of risk, [adverse
impacts]{.mark}, [and **unintended side-effects**]{.mark} associated
with unproven tech]{.underline}nologies. Side effects are particularly
threatening to strained natural ecosystems and economically or
ecologically vulnerable populations.

[Some consequences are fairly
straightforward]{.underline}: the technological system known as BECCS is
meant to couple bioenergy production with Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS) technologies that bury CO2 underground. If rolled out at a
climate-relevant scale, [BECCS would lead to **fierce competition** over
land and resources, widespread **land grabs** and **forced
displacement**, and sharp increases in **global food
prices**]{.underline}.

[Computer simulations have predicted other possible impacts]{.underline}
of geoengineering schemes on the natural world. [[Injecting
aerosols]{.mark} in the stratosphere could [**suppress rainfall**
and]{.mark} potentially [interfere with **monsoon patterns**]{.mark}.
Carbon farm monocultures threaten to **destroy natural ecosystems** at a
massive scale]{.underline}. [[Given]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[natural]{.mark} processes and [systems are **complex**]{.mark},
**non-linear**, and in some measure **chaotic** and
**unpredictable**]{.underline}, the [**overwhelming [majority]{.mark}**
[of effects]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} ripple
through our global ecosystems might [only [become apparent
**after**]{.mark}]{.underline} geoengineering [[technologies
are]{.underline}]{.mark} actually [[deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The systematic [[dominance of]{.mark} physical [science]{.mark} and
engineering [perspectives]{.mark}]{.underline} in geoengineering
research [encourages a **[neglect]{.mark}** of [social and environmental
impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}. This negligence is [characteristic of an
approach that [**addresses symptoms** but leaves]{.mark} the
**[underlying conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that spawned the problem
[[in place]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet the [sociopolitical and
socioeconomic implications]{.underline} of large-scale technological
schemes to "fix" the climate [are **profound**: [under
**existing**]{.mark} **global [power relations]{.mark}**,
[geoengineering is **bound** to be exploited for **corporate**]{.mark}
and **strategic [interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The perfect excuse for continuing business-as-usual

[Finding a **technological shortcut** to climate change is in the
interest of **those responsible** for the bulk of the
problem]{.underline}. [Were the international community to address the
**root cause**]{.underline}s of environmental destruction, [major
pollutants would bear the **political** and **economic
costs**]{.underline}. It is therefore no surprise that
**[[fossil]{.mark} [fuel companies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and their
representatives [often [draw on geoengineering as]{.mark} part of
[the "**solution**" to climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}.4 If
pollution can be cleaned up after the fact and global warming and other
symptoms of climate change can be technologically suppressed, then the
[[industries]{.mark} responsible for]{.underline} environmental [crisis
[can continue **business as usual**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Oil industry moguls and their representatives, such as Haroon Kheshgi at
ExxonMobil, have been at the forefront of developing geoengineering
technologies, particularly to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.5 Kheshgi
is also an author of the upcoming IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C, which
for a broad range of over one hundred international civil society
organizations constitutes a flagrant conflict of interest.6

In many cases, [there is [**direct overlap** between **oil
industry**]{.mark} **interests** [and geoengineering projects]{.mark}
branded as **environmental solutions**]{.underline}. Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS), an important enabling technology for Carbon Dioxide
Removal (CDR), was originally developed by the oil industry as Enhanced
Oil Recovery (EOR), a technique to flush out the final drops of oil from
nearly-depleted wells and reservoirs. Both fossil CCS and CCS coupled
with bioenergy (BECCS) or CO2 from the atmosphere (Direct Air
Capture and CCS, or DACCS) are now touted as contributions to climate
change mitigation.

For a long time, geoengineering was too controversial for big
corporations to publicly endorse. Yet as Steve Horn revealed in
his DeSmog Blog article, "How the Biochar Industry Pushed for Offsets,
Tar Sands, and Fracking Reclamation Using Unsettled

Besides commercial and industrial appetite, [there are]{.underline} also
[serious **military** and **security implications** around]{.underline}
the [deployment and]{.underline} potential [**weaponization** of
geoengineering]{.underline}.

[[Even under]{.mark} the **[ideal deployment]{.mark}
conditions**]{.underline} that [SRM computer simulations assume, impacts
and [side effects]{.mark}]{.underline}---an overall suppression of
rainfall, regional droughts, hurricanes, and floods---[[will
be **unevenly distributed**]{.mark}, resulting in regional winners and
losers. This has **significant ramifications** for international peace
and security]{.underline}. Industrial CDR infrastructure would [place
[excessive demand on]{.mark} water, energy, minerals, and other
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are bound to [[give rise
to]{.mark} a **[new wave of conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} over
precisely these resources.

[[Geoengineering]{.mark} will]{.underline} produce adverse impacts and
side-effects for some regions and
populations, [[render]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[it difficult
to]{.underline}]{.mark} imagine **[[establish]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
[**[consensus]{.mark}** around deployment]{.underline}. Who would
voluntarily accept the potentially devastating consequences of such
technologies? As geoengineering expands outside the realm of labs and
computer models into the real world, [political conflict risks being
[exacerbated by]{.mark} a **systematic [bias]{.mark}** [toward
**powerful nations**]{.mark} more readily positioned to develop and
deploy geoengineering in their favor]{.underline}.

This [situation is exacerbated by global leaders' **sustained
inability** to agree on meaningful and mandatory climate
action]{.underline}. [Under conditions of **unreliable
[multilat]{.mark}**eralism and **fragile accountability**, the
international community [lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} reliable
[[mechanisms for holding]{.underline}]{.mark} potential geoengineering
[[interventions responsible]{.underline}]{.mark} for
liabilities. [Geoengineering is essentially [impossible to **govern
democratically**]{.mark} on the international level]{.underline}.

David [[Keith, one of the most prominent supporters]{.mark} of climate
engineering]{.underline}, and his co-authors in a recent article [are
[surprisingly frank about]{.mark} the **weaponization
potential**]{.underline} of certain geoengineering technologies. The
[global security [threats posed by **unilateral**]{.mark} or
**mini-lateral SRM [deployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, they argue,
[[necessitate counter-measures]{.underline}]{.mark} or
"counter-geoengineering" as a tactical device [[to **deter other
states**]{.mark} from unilaterally deploying the technologies to their
advantage]{.underline}.

According to Keith and co-authors, "counter-geoengineering" [could be
[effected through]{.mark}]{.underline} "counterveiling with a warming
agent, i.e. [**[injecting]{.mark} even [more GHG]{.mark}** into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, and neutralising impacts with a physical
disruption."13

[Counter-geoengineering represents the final step towards climate
militarization and borrows directly from **Cold War deterrence
thinking**]{.underline}. The [authors are unfazed by this]{.underline}
explicitly militaristic [dimension: "Military action to stop SRM
deployment by a powerful state would likely only be launched by another
powerful state or states, potentially [triggering a **systemic
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}."14

[It is **[no coincidence]{.mark}** that [in the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[geoengineering is supported by
individuals]{.mark} and think tanks [with **ties to the
military**]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 At the end of 2017, a bill was
introduced into Congress, which, if approved, would develop a strategic
research agenda for Solar Radiation Management.16

The [upshot of the US officially pursuing a geoengineering research
agenda while simultaneously **withdrawing from the Paris Agreement**
might be a **strategic intensification** of existing geoengineering
research]{.underline} elsewhere, such as the government-led research
programs in China and Russia.17 It is not only the deployment of
geoengineering that has high-stakes geopolitical and security
implications, but also the current pursuit of strategic technology
development.

[High-risk and [global-impact tech]{.mark}nologies are [**inherently
difficult** to **govern democratically**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under
real-world political conditions, they are [likely to [privilege
**powerful states**, granting marginalized pop]{.mark}ulation[s little
say]{.mark}]{.underline} in the newly engineered climate regime.

The [[infrastructure required]{.underline}]{.mark} by geoengineering
also [**limits the autonomy** of less powerful countries and independent
actors]{.underline}. Although small states and rogue climate hackers
could theoretically develop and carry out a one-time SRM intervention,
as David Keith and his co-authors concede, "contrary to the common
assumption that the ability to engage in solar geoengineering would be
widely distributed among states, [practical requirements related to
delivery infrastructure, [technical capacity, and]{.mark} ability to

[SRM]{.mark} capabilities [would be limited to **major powers**]{.mark}

The [**long struggle** to protect the Arctic and the Inuit]{.underline}

and the sole stewardship [of the Arctic lies with]{.mark}]{.underline}
the **[[indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}**' organizations and
representative bodies, including the Greenlandic parliament,
Inatsisarsut, and the Inuit Circumpolar Council.

[[Trump says **outright**]{.mark} what "polite" Danish imperialism has
tried to hide: [that under]{.mark} the logic of [capitalism]{.mark},
countries, people, and [peoples are]{.mark}, at best,
**[commodities]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[at worst, **spoils of
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [For the same reason, Trump's demand for a
renegotiation of the nearly 200-year-old alliance between the **Danish
and American bourgeoisie** has sent Denmark into full-blown **colonial
hysteria**]{.underline}. The height of the hysteria is, of course, the
censorship of the documentary about Danish cryolite mining, which was
removed from the internet this week as a result of obvious political
pressure involving the top levels of government. This censorship was
deeply biased, and with the removal of source material, it is now
difficult, if not impossible, for many citizens to orient themselves in
a crucial social debate.

The significance of cryolite

[The [bourgeois panic]{.mark} in Denmark [must be seen in light
of]{.mark} the **[enormous wealth]{.mark}** that Danish [capitalists
managed to plunder]{.mark} from Greenland [through]{.mark} the
**extraction of [cryolite]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite the fact that
the Danish state charged Danish capitalists for allowing them to steal
Greenland's minerals, Weber's \[Theobald Weber, founder of the Øresund
cryolite factory, ed.\] heirs each received a return of no less than 40%
of the one million they had each received upon their father's death.
Such income does not arise from normal business operations, but solely
from monopolies and colonial rents. The reinvestment of this income has
built the Denmark we know today. C. F. Tietgen, the godfather of the
modern Danish capitalist class, was the man behind the construction of
the mine in Ivittuut. The extraction of cryolite must therefore be seen
as a decisive part of the primitive accumulation that allowed Denmark's
transformation into an industrial society.

[[Without cryolite, aluminum would]{.mark} most likely [never have
become a **widely used**]{.mark} **metal**, and its **far-reaching
capabilities** would not have benefited humanity]{.underline}. [[Denmark
and the US]{.mark} have [shared]{.mark} the **[profits]{.mark}** from
the **exploitation of cryolite** more or less [equally]{.mark} between
them. [For the US, it allowed]{.mark} the [rapid build-up of the **air
force**]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} since World War II has [ensured the US a
**decisive influence** on the world market]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
derived wealth and value of that destiny cannot be measured in numbers.
What it was worth to have a completely unique place in the world where
these rare minerals lay freely on the ground and were used by the local
population for tanning skins is lost in questions of historical ethics.
[Like other colonized peoples, the Inuit of Greenland are left with a
**hole in the ground** where the foundations for centuries of
development of their own society and economy could have been
laid]{.underline}.

Colonialism in the US -- and Denmark

[[Trump's **brash demand** for control]{.mark} over Greenland
[is]{.mark} merely [a **continuation** of]{.mark} the [**colonial**,
**imperial**, and **racist thinking** that]{.mark} has [defined]{.mark}
Danish and [American policy]{.mark} toward Greenland]{.underline}.
Through a long and arduous political struggle, the Greenlandic people
have won the legal and formal rights to independence. But [American

The highly theoretical concept of "[the permanent
non-identity]{.underline}" (Marcuse 1978, 29) [between society and
[nature **does not quit**]{.mark} the issue of
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, Marcuse articulated a
bidimensional theory of the relations between authentic ecologism and
politics. On one side, [[if]{.mark} the [sufferance]{.mark} of nature
[depends]{.mark}]{.underline} not only, but mostly, [[on capitalist
exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[ecologism]{.underline}]{.mark} is
"authentic" and [[escapes the co-option of]{.mark} the "[capitalist
ecology", **only if** it "flows into a **militant struggle for socialist
politics** which]{.mark} must [attack the system at its
roots]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Marcuse 2005, 176). From this point of
view, [campaigning]{.underline} "for universal vegetarianism or
synthetic foodstufs" (Marcuse 1972, 68) [is not a political priority
until]{.underline} "human [solidarity]{.underline}" (emphasis original)
[is established among]{.underline} "who still sustain the established
work process". In order to get in touch with [the masses]{.underline},
"[[political]{.mark} discipline and [organization]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(emphasis original) (Marcuse 1972, 132), reason, mediation, and
compromises [are [required]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On the other hand, if [the difference between liberation of nature and
liberation of humans is permanent, ecologism is irreducible from
the]{.underline} immediate [exigencies of politics]{.underline} and
keeps its utopian-idealistic content. Under this aspect, feminism and
ecologism are rooted more in the deeper dimension of "the mind and body
of individuals themselves" which made the "whole organism . . .
political" than in the objective position of the individuals in the
process of work. So, they are not "class struggle in the traditional
sense" and they "do not constitute a struggle to replace one power
structure with another", while they are "existential revolts against an
obsolete reality principle". This is why theirs is a small-scale
politics, isolated because of their idealistic radicalism rather than
because of the integration of the masses. But, in 1979, this no longer
meant "depoliticization, retreat, and escape", but it was a "token of
their authenticity" (Marcuse 2019a, 17--18), which anticipated in the
present the future character of the individuals in a free society.

This radical shift -- from unity to [[the abyss between radical ecology
and mass politics]{.underline}]{.mark} -- was only [[partially due to
the victory of the **neoliberal counterrevolution**]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the late seventies. Often, in Marcuse's theory, Eros, bearer of true
universal interests, does not arise from within "false" or immediate
needs,10 but from immediate nature. Active political mediation does not
change human needs; at most, art, aesthetics, and small communities or
experiences do.

But the "Great Refusal" of Eros is not necessarily negative. The history
of the environmental movement shows that [isolation from immediate needs
can **support** the establishment more than contrasting it]{.underline}.
Until a few years ago, the leftist ecologism supported the "**[[concrete
utopia of degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Latouche 2008, 18) against
the "spirit" of promethean modernity shared by capitalism and socialism,
by bourgeoisie and workers. Priority was reducing the "material" flows
in the production as such. This [[went]{.mark} very [well for the
establishment, which]{.mark} could [promise **a green turn**]{.mark} of
the economy involving deindustrialisation, fnancialisation, and
bio-digital innovation, [without]{.mark} any [regard to]{.mark} the
social and [political consequences, such as]{.mark} unemployment,
growing social inequality, and authoritarian and eventually
**[techno-fascist eco-regimes]{.mark}**.]{.underline}11

No surprise that in the last decades of the **[[green economy
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark}** we [have [face]{.mark}d [the highest
increase of carbon emission]{.mark}]{.underline} in the known history of
the world. Fortunately, if one can say so, this increase has also pushed
the environmental movement to a global and mass scale and radicalized
its goal toward "climate justice". It embodies, even if sometimes still
implicitly, [the Marxian consciousness that [nature is **still private
property**]{.mark}]{.underline} of some who own the machines through
which nature itself [becomes a factor of social production]{.underline}
and, today, [of destruction]{.underline} and domination. Preventing the
latter is not the interest of all -- such as an all does not exist yet1
-- but first of who is objectively exploited (trough salary, debts, or
other exploitative and often unpaid relation).14 Not by chance, the last
Conferences of Parties, recently directed by Al Jaber, leader of the
Arabic oil company ADNOC and held in [extractivist and authoritarian
countries]{.underline}, are no longer inviting eco-leaders, as if the
establishment itself had [abandoned the strategy to co-opt the movement
to its **failed** green economy experiment]{.underline}.15 Meanwhile,
[[the neoliberal counterrevolution delivers no goods but only
frustration]{.underline}]{.mark} to the "poor workers" even in Western
countries. [Discontent and protests are spreading]{.underline},
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} quite all [[socialist
movements]{.underline}]{.mark}, trade unions, and groups of workers
[**[accept ecological goals]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

There are all the objective and subjective conditions to work on joining
ecologism and socialism.16 [Only together ecologism and
socialism]{.underline} both [become]{.underline} "purely and simply
[[the **negation of** **capital**]{.mark}ist logic]{.underline}"
(Marcuse 2005, 175): [ecologism becomes [more than some green
city]{.mark}, socialism [more than]{.mark} just [a better planned
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much has to be done yet, but the direction
is outlined. On one hand, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[**need** an
international eco-socialist party]{.mark} to mediate and synthesise
particular and universal interests coming from different
subjects]{.underline} (employed, unemployed, young students, women,
Global South people, racialised minor- ities). On the other hand, we
need an autonomous science whose consciousness that [[a new
eco-socialist society is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[possible]{.underline}]{.mark} could help quantify what we could do
[[if we]{.underline}]{.mark} consciously and differently
**[[control]{.underline}]{.mark}**led [[our forces of
production]{.underline}]{.mark}. [What is sustainable for
capitalism]{.underline} would [turn out to be unsustainable]{.underline}
respect to human goals accomplishable beyond it. Maybe the climate
crisis itself would appear to be less apocalyptic than now. [[The
**transcendence** of imagination]{.underline}]{.mark} may become truly
"[a force of social change]{.underline}" (Marcuse 1972, 70), [[an

In recent years, both activists and researchers have started
to invoke the term [fossil imperialism]{.underline}
to [highlight the ways in which [**imperialist politics** are tied up
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the logic of [[fossil
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under fossil capitalism, [**ceaseless
[accumulation]{.mark}** of capital [necessitates]{.mark} **continued
[expansion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an energy base of [coal, oil,
and]{.mark} natural [gas]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Imperial states play a
**key role** in the process]{.underline}, which has in turn enabled a
remarkable concentration of imperial power and continues to do so in
today's world order. Understanding fossil imperialism, therefore, is
necessary for devising effective strategies of resistance to a
planet-wrecking capitalist status quo.

Our model of [[fossil imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark} attempts to
sketch the general workings of this relationship between imperial states
and fossil capital in its historical development over the past two
centuries and in its different varieties. It [[is]{.mark} principally
[based on]{.mark} the two general modes of **expansion and
obstruction**]{.underline}. [On the [one hand]{.mark}, the [expansion
and protection of **new fossil fuel resources** and
**infrastructure**]{.mark} are **crucial** to keeping]{.underline} the
engine rooms of [fossil capital well-supplied. [On the other]{.mark}
hand, the [obstruction]{.mark} or destruction [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
the infrastructure of **[[rivaling]{.underline}]{.mark}** capital
**[[factions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and states in order [to maintain
control]{.underline} over pricing and distribution [has been equally
integral]{.underline} to the history of fossil imperialism. In this way,
the workings of fossil imperialism reflect the more general nature of
capitalism as a mode of production and destruction.

It is important to take into account the specific characteristics of the
three dominant sources of fossil energy (coal, oil, gas) when analyzing
concrete cases. While all three energy sources still hold a significant
share of the global fossil economy, each also corresponds to a distinct
historical phase in the development of fossil imperialism. Coal powered
the rise of the British Empire, the switch to oil marked the ascent of
American hegemony in the 20th century, and fossil gas is increasingly at
the core of the United States' attempt to continue projecting its
supremacy well into the 21st century. While there is growing concern
over new forms of \"green imperialism\", especially in relation to the
extraction and distribution of the raw materials supposedly required to
decarbonize the economies of the North, [current fossil-fueled conflicts
such as the Russian war in Ukraine or the Saudi war in Yemen show that
the age of fossil imperialism is]{.underline} - unfortunately - **[far
from over]{.underline}**.

[There are]{.underline} at least [five ways in which imperial states
facilitate the **interests of fossil capital**: through
**colonization**, the projection of **military power**]{.underline}, the
[**suppression** of anti-extractivist movements, **economic warfare**,
and]{.underline} the [**domination** of global
institutions]{.underline}. This [scheme makes plain the crucial role of
fossil fuels]{.underline}, functioning variously as a driver, [as an
enhancer or as an outcome of imperial states\' actions]{.underline}. It
[disentangles the ways in which [contemporary politics are
**significantly influenced** by fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
have played a defining role in shaping the structure of capitalist
corporations, settler-imperial states, and earth-transforming
technoscience. These [arrangements have had [**profound consequences**
for **ecological destruction**]{.mark} and the implementation of
ecological management strategies]{.underline}.

Colonization is a form of direct political domination and subjugation of
one people by another. It was perhaps most evident during the "golden"
age of coal, the fossil fuel that powered the rise of the British Empire
--- from Australia to India, from South Africa to Borneo. Because coal
extraction requires a large amount of disciplined labor, arguably, it
also necessitates more comprehensive forms of social and political
control than oil and gas extraction. At the same time, the British ---
in many cases --- obstructed the rapid expansion of foreign coal
industries to protect their own domestic industry.  Even in the case of
oil and gas, many of the major private companies like BP and Shell still
operate in markets shaped by colonial legacies.

["[Projection of military power]{.mark}" refers to different kinds of
military interventions short of **full-on colonization**]{.underline}.
Historically, [states often deployed their own forces to [**protect
fossil infrastructure** abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a practice that
continues today in various ways. Projection of military power [also
takes place through proxy armies, funded through a **closed circuit** of
**oil money** and **weapons contracts**]{.underline}, [as [in the case
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the Gulf monarchies. The 20th anniversary of the
invasion of [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} reminds us how current the role
of military power remains. [**Twenty years** after]{.underline} the
regime-change military [intervention, the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[still has **2500
troops**]{.mark} stationed]{.underline} in the country. And, as has
recently been revealed, [[BP and Shell]{.underline}]{.mark}, which had
been barred from the country for decades,
[[have extracted]{.mark} **tens of [billions of dollars]{.mark}** in
Iraqi oil [post-invasion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[pursuit]{.mark} of regional economic dominance on the part of
fossil imperial states [requires]{.mark} the [**suppression** of
anti-extractivist movements]{.mark}]{.underline} and other grassroots
movements opposed to the social order. Interventionary military
assistance was justified from the 1990s onwards on the basis of
immigration enforcement, anti-narcotics control, and fighting against
general criminality. For example, the role of the War on Drugs in
continuing counterinsurgent practices against civilian population that
were carried out until the late 1980s within a Cold War framework.
However, according to Russell Crandall, professor at Davidson College in
North Carolina and former Pentagon and National Security Council
official under George W. Bush, [the significant role in shaping outcomes
is **not [primarily played]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the U.S. military
advisors, but rather by the \"imperial diplomats\"]{.underline} -- the
[**[civilian officials]{.mark}** within the **U.S. foreign policy
structure**]{.underline}.

In his study of economic sanctions, Cornell historian Nicholas Mulder
has demonstrated that [modern-day [sanctions developed out of]{.mark}
mechanisms for **[energy control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, blacklisting,
import and export rationing, property seizures and asset freezes, trade
prohibitions, and preclusive purchasing, as well as financial blockade
--- [simply put, **economic warfare**]{.underline}. He shows that
[effectively isolating a whole nation from the intricate networks that
support global trade requires the ability to **gather information** and
**generate knowledge**]{.underline}. This involves mapping the intricate
web of physical goods and resources that connect the specific country to
the rest of the globe. Key factors in this process include having legal
authority and access to more precise data and statistics. [[What makes
it possible]{.mark} to impose this unilateral sanctions regime on the
rest of the world [is]{.mark} the [**domination** of the
**global**]{.mark}]{.underline} (financial and political)
[[**institutions** that regulate]{.mark} the [trade and distribution of
fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both 19th-century British and
20th-century US-American dominance stemmed from their respective global
leadership in corporate, regulatory, technological, and financial
frameworks, which in turn was tightly linked to the pound sterling and
later the US dollar being the chief reserve and trade currencies of
their time.

[[In]{.mark} the age of **[American heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline}, the
United Nations and other **[[multilat]{.mark}eral
organizations]{.underline}** --- in particular, the Bretton Woods system
(the International Monetary Fund and World Bank) --- [[have become

Joseph [Schumpeter]{.underline} (1883--1950) [coined]{.underline} the
seemingly paradoxical term "**[[creative
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**," and [generations of
economists]{.underline} have [adopted it as a
[shorthand]{.mark}]{.underline} description [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [free [market's **messy way** of]{.mark} [delivering
**progress**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Capitalism, Socialism, and
Democracy (1942), the Austrian economist wrote:

The [[opening up of]{.mark} **new [markets]{.mark}**]{.underline},
foreign or domestic, [and the **organizational
development**]{.underline} from the craft shop to such concerns as U.S.
Steel [illustrate the same process of industrial
mutation]{.underline}---if I may use that biological term---that
[incessantly **[revolutionizes]{.mark}** the **[economic
structure]{.mark}** from within]{.underline}, incessantly
[**destroying** the **old one**, incessantly [creating a **new
one**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} **process of Creative
Destruction** [is the **essential fact about
capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (p. 83)

Although Schumpeter devoted a mere six-page chapter to "The Process of
Creative Destruction," in which [he described [**capitalism**
as]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[the **perennial gale** of **creative
destruction**]{.underline}]{.mark}," it has become [[the
**centerpiece**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} modern thinking on how
[economies]{.mark} evolve]{.underline}.

Schumpeter and the economists who adopt his succinct summary of the free
market's ceaseless churning echo capitalism's critics in acknowledging
that **[lost jobs]{.underline}**, **[ruined companies]{.underline}**,
[and **vanishing industries** are **inherent** parts of the growth
system]{.underline}. The saving grace comes from recognizing the good
that comes from the turmoil. Over time, societies that allow creative
destruction to operate grow more productive and richer; their citizens
see the benefits of new and better products, shorter work weeks, better
jobs, and higher living standards.

Herein [lies the **paradox of progress**]{.underline}. [A [society
cannot reap]{.mark} the **[rewards]{.mark}**]{.underline} of creative
destruction [[without]{.mark} [accepting]{.mark} that some
[individuals]{.mark} might [be **worse off**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
just in the short term, but perhaps **[[forever]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
At the same time, [attempts to soften the]{.underline} harsher
[aspects]{.underline} of creative destruction by trying to preserve jobs
or protect industries [will lead to **stagnation** and
**decline**]{.underline}, short-circuiting the march of progress.
Schumpeter's enduring term reminds us that capitalism's pain and gain
are inextricably linked. The process of creating new industries does not
go forward without sweeping away the preexisting order.

The [[**profit motive** and]{.underline}]{.mark} exclusive proprietary
[[**rights** are **central** to capitalist
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. By law, [private [firms **must
prioritize**]{.mark} the interest of their
**[shareholders]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which tends to be
interchangeable with **[making as much money as
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Accordingly, [investments]{.underline}
in any stage of the innovative process [must eventually produce
**profits**]{.underline}. [[To **maximize** profit]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[private firms]{.mark} **jealously [guard]{.mark}** the value of their
[invention]{.mark}]{.underline} through regulations and restrictive
contracts. Statutes and regulations help protect their trade secrets.
The U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office routinely grants them utility and
design patents that "exclude others from making, using, offering for
sale, or selling ... or importing the invention" for 20 years after the
patent is issued. They enforce licensing agreements that can limit the
uses and dissemination of all or part of their inventions. To further
frustrate efforts to innovate on the back of their inventions, private
firms subject their former employees to non-compete agreements that can
severely limit them from using their knowledge and skills on competing
projects for a period following their departure. Breaches carry dire
consequences like expensive lawsuits, big money judgments, and other
enormous hassles.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

By contrast, the public sector innovates under an academic model instead
of for profit. Certainly, earning tenure or an executive position can be
lucrative. In some industries, a revolving door gives individuals the
opportunity to innovate in both the private and public sectors
throughout their careers. However, innovation in this area is less
motivated by extracting profit, and more so by signifiers of prestige,
career appointments, recognition, publication, project funding, and
prizes. The capitalist model has its perks. At present, private firms
raise massive amounts of capital from the government to fund research,
but also from banks, private equity, and wealthy donors. This vast
amount of capital can prove lucrative for certain classes of workers.
Innovative talent might accumulate wealth through generous compensation
packages, which play an important role in attracting and retaining them.
Private firms also boast a terrifying nimbleness that allows them to
push projects and respond to change faster than government institutions.
For instance, firms can turn over staff quickly if their industry in the
absence of unions and norms against firing workers at will, other than
the standard prohibitions against discriminatory practices. In other
words, without the regulatory and administrative constraints that saddle
publicly funded projects, private firms can move through the innovative
process faster. Another advantage of the capitalist model is that
profits---potential and actual---provide some measure of how well a
company is innovating. Particularly, for the many private firms that
sell some of their shares to the public on stock exchanges, prices serve
as a form of feedback from investors and the market. Imagine that a
publicly-traded retailer announces the imminent launch of an affordable,
solar-powered computer that boasts power and speeds to rival Apple's
newest models. In the hours following the press release, the retailer's
stock value triples. A week later, while at a tech conference in the
Colorado mountains, the retailer's CEO lets it slip that the first
prototype will actually retail for about four thousand dollars.
Unfortunately for the CEO, he was wearing a hot mic. The quote is made
public in an article titled "No debt-saddled, environmentally-conscious
millennial will shed \$4,000 for a computer!" The stock value
immediately plummets by 200 percent. The original rise in the retailer's
share value communicates that investors believe in the product as a
profitable enterprise, and that they see this type of innovation as a
worthwhile pursuit. The drop, on the other hand, suggests that they
believe this specific product would be more marketable and therefore
more profitable if it were developed for an audience beyond high-end
consumers. The turn in the stock value can embolden the
retailer---through its management, Board of Directors, or
shareholders---to revisit its plan to innovate. It also signals to
competitors that their innovation of a similar product could be well
received, especially if they can overcome the original product's
weaknesses.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

But [prioritizing profit is [a **double-edged
sword**]{.mark}]{.underline} that can hamper innovation. [Owning
the]{.underline} proprietary [rights]{.underline} [allows]{.underline}
private [[firms]{.mark} to **[block
workers]{.mark}**]{.underline}---through anti-competitive tools like
non-compete agreements, patents, and licenses---[who put labor into
the]{.underline} innovation [process from applying the]{.underline}
extensive technical [expertise]{.underline} and intimate understanding
of the product [to **improve** the innovation
**substantially**]{.underline}. This becomes especially relevant once
the [workers **leave** the firm]{.underline} division in which they
worked, or leave the firm altogether. Understandably, this [lack of
control]{.underline} and ownership will [cause some
workers]{.underline}, however passionate they may be about a project,
[to be [**less willing** to maximize]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[contribution]{.underline}]{.mark} to the innovation.

Of course, the so-called [nimbleness that allows firms to
make]{.underline} drastic [changes]{.underline} like mass layoffs [is
[**extremely harmful** to]{.mark} the [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is no fluke. [The capitalist economy **thrives** on a reserve army
of labor]{.underline}. Inching closer to full employment makes workers
scarcer, which empowers the labor force as a whole to bargain for higher
wages and better work conditions. These threaten the firm's bottom line.
So, the capitalist economy is structured to maintain the balance of
power towards the owners of capital. Positions that pay well (and less
than well) come with the precariousness of at-will employment and
disappearing union power. A constant pool of unemployed labor is
maintained through layoffs and other tactics like higher interest rates,
which the government will compel to help slow growth and thereby hiring.
This system harms the potential for innovation, too.

The fear of losing work can dissuade workers from taking risks,
experimenting, or speaking up as they identify items that could improve
a taken approach---all actions that foster innovation. Meanwhile,
thousands of individuals who could be contributing to the innovative
process are instead involuntarily un-employed. This model also
encourages monopolization, as concentrating market power gives private
firms the most control over how much profit they can extract. But
squashing competition that could contribute fresh ideas hurts every
phase of the innovation process, while giving workers in fewer
workplaces space to innovate.

[[**Deferring to profit** causes]{.underline}]{.mark} [many areas of
[R&D to go **unexplored**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Private [firms have
**less reason to invest**]{.mark} in innovations likely to be made
universally available for free if managers or investors do not see much
upside for the firm's bottom line]{.underline}. In theory, the slack in
private research can be picked up by the public sector. In reality,
however, [**[decades of austerity]{.mark}** measures
**[threaten]{.mark}** the public's [ability to underwrite]{.mark} risky
and inefficient [research]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both the Democratic and
Republican parties increasingly adhere to a neoliberal ideology that
vilifies "big government," promotes running government like a business,
pretends that government budgets should mirror household budgets or the
private firm's balance sheet, and rams privatization under the guises of
so-called public-private partnerships and private subcontractors.

In the United States, [**public [investment]{.mark}** in R&D [has been
**trending downward**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As documented in a 2014
report from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation,
"\[f\]rom 2010 to 2013, federal R&D spending fell from \$158.8 to
\$133.2 billion ... Between 2003 and 2008, state funding for university
research, as a share of GDP, dropped on average by 2 percent. States
such as Arizona and Utah saw decreases of 49 percent and 24 percent
respectively." Even if public investment in the least profitable aspect
of research suddenly surged, in our current model, the private sector
continues to be the primary driver of development, production, and
distribution. Where there remains little potential for profit, private
firms will be reluctant to advance to the next phases of the innovation
process. Public-private projects raise similar concerns. Coordinated
efforts can increase private investment by spreading some costs and risk
to the public. But to attract private partners in the first place, the
public sector has a greater incentive to prioritize R&D projects with
more financial upsides.

This is how the [[quest for profits]{.mark} and tight grip
over]{.underline} proprietary [rights]{.underline}, both important
features of the capitalist model, [[**discourage**
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Innovations]{.underline}]{.mark} are bound
for [**plateauing** after a few years]{.underline}, [as firms
increasingly favor minor **aesthetic tweaks** and updates over **bold
ideas** while [**preventing** other]{.mark} avenue[s]{.mark} of
innovation [from **blossoming**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time,
massive amounts of capital continue to float into the hands of a few.
The [price of innovating under capitalism is then]{.underline} both
[**decreased innovation** and **decreased equality**]{.underline}. The
idea that this approach to innovation must be our best and only option
is a delusion.

[[Policymakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, mainly [in the Global North, [have
been implementing]{.mark} new **[green growth]{.mark} strategies** or
Green New Deals]{.underline}. The [[narrative of
**sustainability**]{.mark} and **development**]{.underline} behind these
policies [relies on **ecological modernization ideology**, whose
proponents [**do not question** growth]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wilson,
2013). According to them, these tactics promise more sustainable
industrialization and downscaling of critical emissions (Chuffart et
al., 2021; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023; Zografos, 2022; Zografos & Robbins,
2020). Such [strategies [create opportunities for]{.mark} **national**
and **transnational [companies ]{.mark}**[to]{.mark} develop so-called
sustainable mining]{.underline} for transition minerals,
[battery-grid-electrification complexes with major low carbon
infrastructural expansion, large scale hydroelectricity projects,
industrial wind power or large-scale solar power projects in the global
South and North]{.underline} (Avila, 2018; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022;
Zografos, 2022). However, [these approaches focus on the
[add]{.mark}ition of [**new sources** of energy and materials, rather
than]{.mark} their **[full substitution]{.mark}**. [Coal]{.mark}
production [continues to **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Roy &
Schaffartzik, 2021; York & Bell, 2019), [[not least in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} (Savin et al., 2021). Even nuclear energy
and natural gas are seen as two of the solutions to meet net zero
targets on the decarbonization journey (IEA, 2022; Kemfert et al., 2022;
Namaganda et al., 2023). Nonetheless, nuclear or natural gas-powered
projects also face opposition (Temper et al., 2020).

The term \"green extractivism\" is related conceptually not only to
studies (particularly after about 2015) that analyze conflicts around
so-called transition minerals for electrification (Dunlap, 2017), but
also to the critique of the so-called bioeconomy and conflicts and
policies to replace fossil fuels, dating back to the 2000s (Gudynas &
Acosta, 2011). Flex crops (such as sugar cane or palm oil) and \'flex
trees\' led to increased cultivation and extraction for agrofuels, feed,
and fiber, facilitated by land grabbing. These \"green\" plantation
expansions perpetuated social inequality and environmental destruction
(Borras et al., 2016; Dorn et al., 2022; Kröger, 2011, 2016b). We
consider green extractivism as a subset of extractivism, with those
activities under the green economy including more than the bioeconomy
(Levidow, 2014). Hence, green extractivism does not simply relate to
forests and agriculture. The [current [conversation about **green
extractivism**]{.mark} and the **climate crisis** [focuses on windfarms,
solar, battery complexes]{.mark}, and mining [the metals needed for
**all of these**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, extractivism manifests
itself in many forms and degrees, with diverse effects and consequences
(Kröger, 2022a: 47). [Green extractivism [**fuels capitalist expansion**
through]{.mark} so-called **sustainable development policies**, with
implications for international and national legal and political
frameworks]{.underline}. These [policies **jeopardize** social,
ecological, and political realities, and create [\"green sacrifice
zones\" in which]{.mark} certain [lives **exposed to contamination** are
regarded as having **less value**]{.mark} than others]{.underline}
(Mejia-Muñoz & Babidge, 2023; Zografos, 2022).

[Green extractivism arises in the name of **climate change mitigation**
or green economic \'\'development\']{.underline}\' (Dunlap & Riquito,
2023). Green extractivism is therefore a process, and in addition to
flex crops, may include bioplastics, carbon offsets (e.g. REDD+)
(Kröger, 2016b), transition mineral mining and related infrastructure
and transportation services (Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Bruna, 2022). [The
term \"green\" added to extractivism has, however, typically **little to
do with sustainability** and solutions to the climate
crisis]{.underline} (Zografos, 2022). Green extractivism [often
[causes]{.mark} interrelated [**socio-environmental pressures** through
**overexploitation**]{.mark} of socioecological
territories]{.underline}, including their culture, spirituality,
lifeways, food and customs, and social relations in general (Andreucci &
Zografos, 2022; Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Jerez et al., 2021). Thus,
extractive \"green\" processes [have typically neocolonialist
characteristics in the Global South]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011; Hughes
et al., 2023; Jerez et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They [also appear
within the immediate semi-peripheries of the Global North, such as the
**Arctic**]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022).

In biophysical terms, extractivist economies depend on the extraction of
energy and materials, and generate waste (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971;
Martinez-Alier, 2022). In social terms, control, access, and use of
natural resources, disproportionate toxic pollution, and climate impacts
are typically part of this process. There are also intersectional
processes of \"Othering\", violence, and death brought about by the
creation and abuse of social divisions, along the lines of gender,
class, race, sexual orientation, caste, and cultures (Andreucci &
Zografos, 2022; Batalla, 2020; Pulido & De Lara, 2018; Tran & Hanaček,
2023). We identify such processes in varieties of extractivism aiming to
achieve a carbon-free future, and to slow the climate emergency
\"ticking clock\" (Bruna, 2022; Clark, 2021).

[Activists and academics have highlighted how \"green\" opportunities
are **not a solution** to this crisis, but rather a **continuation** of
extractivism]{.underline}. [Green extractivism]{.underline}, despite its
name, [still [relies on **intense material
extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Dunlap,
2018, 2021; Jerez et al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). In
theory it promotes sustainable development and prosperity for all, but
[in practice [turns into **intolerable levels of hardship**]{.mark} [for
Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples, fisher, and peasant
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Akbulut et al., 2019). In what
follows, we argue that the extension of [green sacrifice
zones]{.underline}, as well as the new consensus surrounding the
decarbonization path, [[can be seen as an expansion of **commodity** and
**waste frontiers**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Martinez-Alier, 2023),
[building on historical patterns of **colonialism and
extractivism**]{.underline}.

[[Renewable energy projects share]{.mark} many of the [characteristics
of **extractive industries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Because of]{.mark}
the image propagated by **[mainstream media]{.mark}**]{.underline} about
renewable energy, the [industry's [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} and
modus operandi [[are **rarely scrutinised**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
renewable energy industries are not as clean, green, or sustainable as
one would think, especially in the world of biofuels.

Sugarcane, maize, or palm oil, from which the main
[[agrofuels]{.underline}]{.mark} are made, require very large amounts of
land, are grown with significant amounts of chemical inputs, are farmed
on monocrop plantations, and generally use fossil fuel technology for
planting, harvesting and transportation. Because of their reliance on
fossil fuel technologies, the [[ecological
footprints]{.underline}]{.mark} of the whole lifecycle of sugarcane and
corn ethanol are substantial and [**[do not outweigh]{.mark}** their
[reduction of CO2]{.mark} as a **replacement fuel** to petroleum
oil.]{.underline} 

In many regions of the developing world agrofuels have been associated
with land grabs, population displacements, poor working conditions, and
marginalisation or the adverse incorporation of small-scale producers.
This makes them a very uneconomical, as well as socially and
environmentally unjust, way of addressing climate change. But the
problem is not restricted only to biofuels and agrofuels. In certain
developing countries, some [[solar energy]{.mark} parks [and
wind]{.mark} farms [have generated **similar problematic
outcomes**]{.mark}.]{.underline}  

Two types of technologies are largely used to produce [solar
energy]{.underline}: photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power
(CSP). The former mainly uses solar panels to capture sunlight and
transform it into electricity, while the latter uses lenses, mirrors, or
parabolic troughs and dishes to focus sunlight and heat a fluid that
is, in turn, used to generate and store electricity. 

Small-scale PV off-grid [technology and initiatives]{.underline},
typically on domestic rooftops, have not been the ones that have been
attracting large investment in the Global South. Instead, solar energy
initiatives [have [taken the form of]{.mark} large-scale]{.underline}
solar PV [farms]{.underline} or CSP parks [that require **[substantial
tracts of land]{.mark}** ranging from several hundred to a **few
thousand hectares**]{.underline}. In some cases, like in India, just as
agrofuel projects do, [solar energy [companies claim]{.mark} that the
[land]{.mark} where they set up their park [is **degraded or
inhabited**]{.mark}, [even though it is important for]{.mark} the
**[livelihood of the local population]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

'Electrify everything' means more mining

The [[energy transition towards renewables relies on]{.mark} extractive
industries, especially **[mining]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for very
crucial components of the devices used to produce electricity. Solar PV
panels and cells require copper, palladium, titanium dioxide, aluminium,
sand or quartz, and zinc. Turbines require steel, iron, copper,
aluminium, copper, manganese, nickel, zinc, rare earth elements for
magnets and batteries, and cobalt for magnets.
Copper, rare-earth elements, and cobalt, which are also crucial for
digital technology, are required in large amounts for electric vehicles.
[This is already [triggering **geostrategic planning** among **core
capitalist countries** and makes resistance]{.mark} to mining **even
more [difficult]{.mark}** [for local]{.mark} marginalised or
racialised [pop]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite the
existence of numerous international covenants that should protect their
rights.

[The [mining]{.mark} of the mineral inputs required by the energy
transition [is]{.mark} increasingly [carried out in **open-pits** with
**large-scale machinery**]{.mark}. This does require less labour than in
the past, but [dramatically increases
**environmental damages**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as tonnes of waste,
air pollution, and water contamination due to the use of hazardous
chemicals like cyanide and mercury. [[Complete territories]{.mark} and
their population [are being **sacrificed**]{.mark} for the **global
energy transition**]{.underline}.

No sustainable development without self-determination

A major claim of this article is that, [while commodity extraction has
boomed under **neoliberal globalisation**, it has not contributed much
to development in the Global South]{.underline}. As part
of the structural adjustment programmes of the 1990s, [many [developing
countries]{.mark} had to **[reform their mining codes]{.mark}** in [to
create **'competitive' investment environments**]{.mark}, reducing
royalties and taxes, and easing environmental regulations. This has
[allowed a **powerful minority**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with access to
the state, [[to capture]{.mark} the [rent]{.mark}s from these
activities [while]{.mark} the [local ecosystems and pop]{.mark}ulation[s
have **borne the costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[If we want to embark on a socially just and **environmentally
sustainable energy [transition]{.mark}**, the global architecture of
inter-state relations]{.underline}, as well as national political
regimes, [[will require **fundamental democratic reforms** and
**struggles**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Only under these
circumstances will local populations be able to exercise the right
to self-determination and genuinely determine whether renewable
energy or mining projects respect their way of life and align with their
collective vision of what development ought to be. 

#### Intent [doesn\'t]{.underline} matter\-\--as long as we win their project is [structurally flawed]{.underline}, the monetization of [repeated failures]{.underline} sustains processes of [capitalist accumulation]{.underline}.

Consequently, there is a pressing necessity to analyze failure and the
rationale behind its continual recurrence while challenging its rapid
disappearance in service of the powerful (Miyazaki & Riles, 2007;
Sims, 2017). This requires being "vigilant" so as not to let failure
"slip from fact to judgment, from moral and legal dereliction to
denigration" (Alexander, 2023, p. 11; see also Appadurai &
Alexander, 2020). While much literature on development has analyzed many
failures of state-backed development programs (Ferguson, 1994;
Gupta, 2012; Li, 2007; Mosse, 2005), [there is an [urgent necessity
to]{.mark}]{.underline} now examine and possibly [[resist]{.mark}
tech-entrepreneurs\' [endeavors to profit from **recurrent failures**
while shifting]{.mark} the [burden onto the **less
privileged**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Appadurai & Alexander, 2020). This
article explains why agtech sustainability projects are prone to fail on
their own terms, thereby challenging the foundations of these capitalist
projects. [The [concept of sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [whether
used as a facade to [mask **corporate destructive actions**]{.mark} or
understood as empowering future generations in the face of escalating
climate challenges, holds **considerable significance** and **moral
implications** in the contemporary world]{.underline}. Thus, rather than
criticizing the concept itself, following Tsing (2017), [this
article]{.underline} takes it seriously and advocates for alternative
approaches by [propos]{.underline}ing [the concept of **[violent
sustainability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In doing so, it [challenges the
normalization and monetization]{.underline}5 [of **recurrent failures**
prevalent among **tech-entrepreneurial ventures**]{.underline}.

A [widespread and uncritical embrace of tech-entrepreneurialism, which
[prioritizes a **market-driven approach** to **environmental
sustainability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, coupled with blitzscaling
[[affords]{.mark} tech-[entrepreneurs]{.mark} the [liberty to
test]{.mark} out their business [models on]{.mark}]{.underline} farming
[[communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, often resulting in significant harm
to these populations. I refer to this as violent sustainability to
achieve two things. First, the [oxymoron [highlights the **inherent

Fortunately, [climate capitalism and its [**market-based approach** to
addressing]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark} crisis [have been around for
**enough time** to examine]{.mark} its
**[success]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least to some degree. In Adkin's
article on climate capitalism and ecological democracy, she clearly
identifies how [market-based approaches have [**failed** to
bring]{.mark} the [**necessary reductions** to]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark} thus far]{.underline} (2017, 4). She goes on to
deploy figures, stating that globally [[we must lower CO2
emissions]{.mark} from 2015 levels [by 34 gt by 2030 and 14.2 gt by
2050]{.mark}, all this [to have a]{.mark} **greater than [50 per cent
chance]{.mark}** [of staying below]{.mark} a **[1.5 C]{.mark}
temperature increase**]{.underline} (4). These projections add empirical
data to the sentiment that there is a long way to go to achieve
decarbonization. Adkin also warns that [national [targets submitted
at]{.mark} the [Paris]{.mark} Conference of Parties in 2015 [are
**inadequate**]{.mark} to achieve such reductions]{.underline} (4).
[Given that these targets were [developed under]{.mark} the **[climate
capitalism framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and many of them
are not on track to be met, [it is reasonable to say that climate
capitalism has **great strides** to take before **effectively reining in
global warming**. Additionally]{.underline}, the
[[Coronavirus]{.underline}]{.mark} pandemic beginning in 2020 [was an
**enormously disruptive event** that [squashed emissions for some
time]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rabson 2022). [The [**aggressive return** to
high emissions afterward proves]{.mark} that]{.underline} a [[climate
capitalis]{.underline}]{.mark}t fra[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ework [[is
**incapable** of seizing]{.mark} **radical [opportunities]{.mark}** to
prevent **global warming**]{.underline}, and instead prefers to work at
its own pace.

Climate change is caused by the emission of carbon and other greenhouse
gases, but [the larger [driver of global warming is **capital
accumulation**]{.mark} **itself**]{.underline}. Every day, [we witness
evidence of Marx's argument that capitalism drives tirelessly toward
**endless accumulation**. This accumulation [requires **continuously
expanding** resource extraction]{.mark}, production, consumption,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}---[most
importantly]{.underline}---[multiplication and **intensified
[exploitation]{.mark}** [of a proletariat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even
mere threats of a contraction of growth rates can cause great panic
among the capitalist class.

[[Accumulation depends upon fossil fuels]{.mark}, but not for the
reasons one might suspect]{.underline}. As Andreas Malm demonstrates
in Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the Roots of Global
Warming (2016), [capitalism availed itself of coal-fueled steam power
not because it was a better technology than the water wheel but [because
it granted capitalists **social power** over workers]{.mark} and
mechanical power [that better suited]{.mark} capitalism's demand for
**[ceaseless production of commodities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In short, global warming is a direct consequence of capital accumulation
because [the capitalist class, in its quest for endless accumulation,
relies on carbon burning as a means of **maintaining social and
mechanical power**]{.underline}. Even in the face of climatological
devastation, as Kohei Saito demonstrates in Marx in the
Anthropocene: Towards the Idea of Degrowth Communism (2023) and Slow
Down: The Degrowth Manifesto (2024), [capitalism is **incapable** of
healing the ecological wounds it has created. It cannot even stop itself
from making the wounds deeper. [Ecology is thus a **class issue**;
ecological devastation is **class violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Capitalism will **sacrifice everything**]{.mark}, including the
universal metabolism of nature, [to continue]{.mark}]{.underline} what
Beverley Best, in The Automatic Fetish: The Law of Value in Marx's
Capital (2024), has called "[value metabolism]{.underline}."
Value---translated from the German "Wert," derived from "werden," to
become---is nothing other than the possibility of becoming. [The
[accumulation of value]{.mark} in the abstract is the **disaccumulation
of concrete possibilities**. To grow piles of money endlessly is
[inherently antagonistic to]{.mark} the realization of [**material forms
of social wealth**: schools, hospitals]{.mark}, free time, green energy
infrastructure, a [livable environment, and so on]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The problem is not how money is spent; the [problem is that
**money exists**]{.mark}. Money can **never serve** as the **material
foundation** of truly social wealth]{.underline}. A simple thought
experiment confirms this: in a world where everyone would possess the
exact same amount of money, all money would be worthless. [Money's [only
purpose is to be taken away, hoarded, and used to]{.mark} renew and
[expand]{.mark} the [value metabolism]{.mark} that necessarily threatens
the **universal metabolism of nature**]{.underline}.

[This is why [capital accumulation and ecological sustainability can
**never be reconciled**. One is always]{.mark} necessarily [**wrecking
the othe**r]{.mark}. The climate is not merely changing; it is being
wrecked]{.underline}. [There are those among the ranks of [capitalist
economists]{.mark} and insurers]{.underline} who understand that climate
wreckage will also wreck capitalism "as we know it," but even they cling
to the hope of decarbonized endless growth. They [[refuse the
lesson]{.mark} of climate wreckage---that [attempting to extract
**infinite value** from **finite**]{.mark} **labor and [matter]{.mark}**
[can only create **destruction** and death]{.mark} on **ever-greater
scales**]{.underline}.

And yet, even as humanity faces perhaps the greatest existential crisis
in its species' history, the public [[debate]{.mark} on climate
[barely]{.mark} [mentions]{.mark} the **[underlying economic
system]{.mark}** that brought us to this point]{.underline} and which
continues to drive us toward the precipice. Ever since its emergence in
the seventeenth century, with the creation of the first limited
liability shareholder-owned corporations, [[capitalism]{.mark} has been
premised on [view]{.mark}ing the [planet as a **resource to
exploit**]{.mark} --- its overriding objective to **maximize profits**
from that exploitation as **rapidly and extensively** as
possible]{.underline}. [Current mainstream
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} to resolve our twin crises of climate
breakdown and ecological overshoot [[without changing the **underlying
system** of growth]{.mark}-based global capitalism [are **structurally
inadequate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The idea of ["**[green growth]{.mark}**" is promulgated by many
development consultants, [and]{.mark} is even incorporated in the UN's
official plan for "**[sustainable development]{.mark}**," but [has
been]{.mark} shown to be [an **illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Ecomodernists, and others who stand to profit from growth in the
short-term, frequently make the argument that, through technological
innovation, aggregate global economic output can become "absolutely
decoupled" from resource use and carbon emissions --- permitting
limitless growth on a finite planet. [Careful rigorous analysis, though,
shows that this hasn't happened so far, and even the **most wildly
aggressive assumptions** for greater efficiency would still lead to
**unsustainable consumption** of global resources]{.underline}.

[The [primary reason]{.mark} for this [derives]{.mark} ultimately
[from]{.mark} the **[nature of capitalism itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Under capitalism --- which has now become the default global economic
context for virtually all human enterprise --- [[efficiency
improvements]{.mark} intended to reduce resource usage **inevitably**
[become launchpads for **further exploitation**, leading]{.mark}
paradoxically [to an **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than
decrease, [[in consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[This dynamic, known as the [**Jevons paradox**, was]{.mark} first
[recognized]{.mark} back [in the nineteenth century]{.mark}]{.underline}
by economist William Stanley Jevons, who demonstrated how [James [Watts'
steam engine]{.mark}, which greatly improved the efficiency of
coal-powered engines, paradoxically [caused a]{.mark} **dramatic
[increase]{.mark}** [in **coal consumption**]{.mark}]{.underline} even
while it decreased the amount of coal required for any particular
application. [The Jevons paradox has since been [shown to be true in
a]{.mark}n **endless [variety of domains]{.mark}**, from the invention
in the nineteenth century of the [cotton gin]{.mark} which [led to an
**increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than decrease
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the practice of
**[[slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the American South, [to improved
**automobile [fuel efficiency]{.mark}** which [encourage]{.mark}s
[people to drive **longer distances**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When the Jevons paradox is generalized to the global marketplace, we
begin to see that [it's not really a paradox at all, but rather an
inbuilt **defining characteristic** of capitalism. Shareholder-owned
corporations]{.underline}, as the primary agents of global capitalism,
[are legally structured by the **overarching imperative** to **maximize
shareholder returns** above all else]{.underline}. Although they are
given the legal rights of "personhood" in many jurisdictions, ~~if they
were actually humans they would be diagnosed as psychopaths~~,
[ruthlessly pursuing their goal without regard to any **collateral
damage** they might cause]{.underline}. Of the hundred largest economies
today, sixty-nine are transnational corporations, which collectively
represent a relentless force with one overriding objective: to turn
humanity and the rest of life into fodder for endlessly increasing
profit at the fastest possible rate.

[Under global capitalism, [this]{.mark} dynamic [holds true **even
without**]{.mark} the involvement of **transnational
[corporations]{.mark}**. Take **bitcoin** as an example]{.underline}.
Originally designed after the global financial meltdown of 2008 to wrest
monetary power from the domination of central banks, it relies on
building trust through "mining," a process that allows anyone to verify
a transaction by solving increasingly complex mathematical equations and
earn new bitcoins as compensation. A great idea --- in theory. In
practice, [the [unfettered marketplace for bitcoin]{.mark} mining has
[led to]{.mark} **frenzied competition** to solve ever more complex
equations, with [vast warehouses]{.mark} holding "rigs" [of **advanced
computers** consuming **massive amounts of electricity**]{.mark}, with
the result that the carbon [emissions from bitcoin
processing]{.mark} are [now equivalent to]{.mark} that of a **mid-size
country** such as [**Sweden** or **Argentina**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Only [limiting]{.underline} growth solves\-\--transition under capitalism [expands]{.underline} fossil fuels [instead]{.underline}.

A realistic historical assessment tells us that [there is [**no purely
technological path** to a sustainable society]{.mark}. Although a rapid
shift to renewables is a crucial component of any conceivable path to a
carbon-free, ecological world]{.underline}, the [[technical obstacles
to]{.mark} such a [transition are **much greater** than is]{.mark}
**usually [assumed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The biggest barrier is the
up-front cost of building an entirely new energy infrastructure geared
to renewables rather than relying on the existing fossil-fuel
infrastructure. [[Construction]{.mark} of a new energy infrastructure
[requires **vast amounts** of **energy consumption**]{.mark}, and would
lead]{.underline}---[[if current]{.mark} consumption and **economic
[growth]{.mark}** [were not]{.mark} to be
[reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}---[to [further demand]{.mark}s on
[existing **fossil-fuel resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This would
mean, as ecological economist Eric Zencey has explained, "an aggressive
expansion of the economy's footprint in paradoxical service to the goal
of achieving sustainability." Assuming the average EROEI of fossil fuels
keeps falling, the difficulty only becomes worse. [[Ecological
economists and peak-oil theorists]{.mark} have [dubbed this the
"**energy trap**]{.mark}." In Zencey's words, "The problem is rooted in
the **sunken energy costs** of the **petroleum
infrastructure**]{.underline} (which makes the continued use of
petroleum energetically cheap)" even when the EROEI of such fossil fuels
in the case of unconventionals is lower than wind and solar.41 [It
follows that building an [alternative energy
infrastructure]{.mark}---without breaking the carbon budget---would
[require a **tectonic shift** in the direction of **energy
conservation**]{.mark} and energy efficiency]{.underline}.

#### Investment in the military industrial complex furthers imperialist enterprises, cementing capitalism globally.

**Bray '20** (Francesca Lucia Bray, PhD, Cambridge University,
"Neoliberalism and Empire: The American Military-Industrial Complex,"

[Another aspect of **[the]{.mark} American [military-industrial
complex]{.mark}** is the extent to which it **[arms the]{.mark} rest of
the [world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This could be due to unstated
hegemonic policies or [an **extension of "American
imperialism"**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a government-coordinated strategy
but [given the influence of the military-industrial complex has with
policymakers, it appears to simply be good business]{.underline}. A
Congressional Research Service report in 2008 showed that \$55.2 billion
(US) in weapons deals were concluded globally in that year; and of that,
the United States was responsible for \$37.8 billion (US), or 68%. 41
The closest competitor was Italy, with \$3.7 billion (US), or 6.7%.
Export laws that can slow or block the sale of military technology have
been under attack from lobbyists and willing government officials. In
2008, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wanted to see "'wholesale
changes to the rules and regulations on government technology exports'
in the name of 'competitiveness.'"42 [By taking advantage of the
intimate relationship they have with the US government, American defense
contractors are influencing policy to grow their business
abroad]{.underline}. Coupled with this, in some cases [**[the sale of
arms]{.mark}** to other nations **[promotes destabilization]{.mark}**
which is [compatible with]{.mark} the **[spreading of
neoliberalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[The US-led]{.mark} coalition [invasion of Iraq]{.mark} in 2003
[stands]{.mark} out [as clear evidence of]{.mark} the **[forced
propagation of the neoliberal agenda]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Efforts to
find legitimate reasons to invade Iraq, such as the (fallacious)
existence of a secret Iraqi program to develop and use weapons of mass
destruction (WMD's). This project failed, so President G. W. Bush sold
the invasion as a mandate for freedom, announcing that "'freedom is the
Almighty's gift to every man and woman in this world" and "as the
greatest power on earth (the US has) an obligation to help the spread of
freedom". 44 What followed was a lightning-quick invasion of Iraq that
penetrated Baghdad and toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. On
September 19, 2003, Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional
Authority that replaced the Iraqi government, issued orders that
included the following: full privatization of public enterprises; full
ownership by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses; full repatriation of
foreign profits; the opening of Iraq's banks to foreign control;
national treatment for foreign companies; and the elimination of nearly
all trade barriers. 45 The orders applied to all areas of the economy
except oil, which was exempted. 46 Further, a regressive "flat tax" was
established, the right to strike was outlawed, and unions were banned in
key sectors. The Iraqi interim government appointed in June 2004 was
given no power to write new laws or change old ones; they could only
work within the laws laid down by the Coalition Provisional Authority.
47 "What the US evidently sought to impose upon Iraq was a full-fledged
neoliberal state apparatus whose fundamental mission was and is to
facilitate conditions for profitable capital accumulation for all
newcomers, Iraqi and foreigners alike."48 In Iraq and Afghanistan, the
American military-industrial complex dramatically expanded the role of
on-the-ground contractors to the point that in 2010, there were 262,681
contractors and assistance staff in these two countries, 49 which is
greater than the number of US uniformed soldiers (154,000 as of December
2010) 50 deployed at the time. Of these employees, 47,282 (18%) were
performing security functions. 51 It was estimated by the 2011
Commission on Wartime Contracting that at least \$117 billion (US) was
spent on or obligated to contractors between October 2001 and 2011. 52
One of the advantages of contractor manpower on the ground is that there
is less political cost associated with them; the Secretary of Defense
can say truthfully that they are drawing down troops in Iraq, 53 while
leaving unsaid the number of contractors remaining in-country. In terms
of headcount, contractors were the largest coalition contingent
deployed.

[[The]{.mark} American [military-industrial complex]{.mark} not only
**[provided the technical means]{.mark}** to assure swift (initial)
victories in Iraq and Afghanistan, it provided much of the manpower
needed]{.underline} and has profited greatly from doing so, [while
[facilitating]{.mark} an overt **[takeover]{.mark}** of a wealthy nation
[and]{.mark} its **[transformation into a neoliberal
state]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The military-industrial complex and the "disastrous rise of
**[misplaced power]{.mark}**]{.underline}"54 that President Eisenhower
warned of [have [come to full fruition]{.mark} and [show]{.mark} how [a
state's government]{.mark} can be [co-opted by]{.mark} non-state actors
**[acting in accordance with a neoliberal agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Arms and military service industries have effectively captured
legislation in the US,]{.underline} so that they have access to ready
markets globally for their goods and services. [American interventions
in Honduras, Iraq and Afghanistan represent some of many examples of the
global reach of the American military industrial complex]{.underline}.
Overall it is apparent that [[the]{.mark} mutually beneficial
[relationship between]{.mark} American defense [contractors and
the]{.mark} US [government has grown]{.mark} much stronger [with]{.mark}
their [**shared pursuit of a global neoliberal
agenda**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The nature of the relationship predates
neoliberalism, but the opportunity to reap the rewards of defense
contract spending and international arms sales, while the government
largely underwrites the risks of R&D, is a very appealing business model
that draws in government decision-makers to become eventual lobbyists
for defense industries, perpetuating favourable government purchasing
decisions. [The defense industry uses these relations to weaken policies
and grow the international market for its arms in which it already
enjoys an oligopoly. **[The American global neoliberal agenda]{.mark}**
**[benefits from the military-industrial complex]{.mark}** as it
provides: technical means to a swift victory; the ability to put
manpower on the ground with less political cost; and a way to
destabilize states through arms sales and training.]{.underline}

The earth has provided a relatively stable environment that promoted the
development of human civilization over the past 11,000 years. But today,
humanity is pushing past important planetary boundaries, and by so doing
is threatening to undermine its own environmental foundations (Steffen
et al. 2015). Scientists have published increasingly dire warnings about
our environmental predicament, but contemporary societies seem unable to
adequately respond and change course. Allan Schnaiberg (1980) developed
the treadmill of production model in order to explain this state of
affairs. [Capitalism]{.underline}, according to this theory, [is
premised on an **[ever-growing expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
production of goods and services (Schnaiberg 1980; Gould, Pellow, and
Schnaiberg 2008). [Because]{.underline} the [production of an increasing
amount of goods and services requires the increasing use of energy and
natural resources]{.underline}, along with an increasing amount of waste
and pollution, [expanding economies [produce increasing]{.mark} amounts
of **[environmental degradation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to
treadmill theorists, [it is]{.underline} very difficult, if not
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[to step off the
treadmill]{.mark} and [onto a **stable-state
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [because]{.underline} the
[profit]{.underline}ability of corporations, revenue for gov- ernments,
[and]{.underline} job opportunities for [labor are]{.underline} all
[linked to]{.underline} increasing economic [growth]{.underline}
(Schnaiberg 1980; Gould, Pellow, and Schnaiberg 2008). Empirical tests
have strongly substantiated the tenets of the treadmill of pro- duction
model (Jorgenson and Clark 2009; York, Rosa, and Dietz 2003).

Hooks and Smith (2004), however, recognized that not all kinds of
environmental degradation are caused by the expansionary logic of
capitalism. They developed [the treadmill of destruction]{.underline}
model to explain how militarism and geopolitical struggles negatively
impact the environment in ways that are distinct from the economy.
While, they write, '[the [**expansionary logic of capitalism**
is]{.mark} the explanatory mechanism [at the heart of the **treadmill of
production**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [**[arms races and geopolitical
competition]{.mark}** among states [play a comparable]{.mark} role when
considering the environmental danger posed by militarism']{.underline}
(Hooks and Smith 2004, 561). [[As governments
compete]{.underline}]{.mark} with one another [for territory and
power]{.underline}, [[they invest ever-greater]{.mark} amounts of
[capital into]{.mark} **increasingly [destructive]{.mark}**
[weaponry]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Producing]{.underline} this
[weaponry]{.underline}, testing it, [mobilizing it]{.underline} around
the globe, [and]{.underline} ultimately [using it requires **tremendous
amounts** of natural resources and leaves **a legacy of toxic
contamination**]{.underline} (Frey 2013; Hooks and Smith 2004; Jorgenson
and Clark 2015; Smith, Hooks, and Lengefeld 2014). Research evidence has
borne out the tenets of the treadmill of destruction model by
demonstrating that [rates of [militarism have]{.mark} their [own
**independent effect** on the environment]{.mark}, apart from that of
the treadmill of production]{.underline} (Hooks and Smith 2004;
Jorgenson and Clark 2009).

Researchers have made a strong case that [[the treadmills of production
and destruction]{.mark} are both important drivers of environmental
decline]{.underline}, and that [the two [are]{.mark} distinct and
[**irreducible logics**; one cannot be explained solely in **terms** of
the other]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly, however, [the logics of
capitalism and militarism are often complementary]{.underline}
(Jorgenson and Clark 2009). David Harvey (2005) argued as much,
theorizing that they are intertwined logics of power that are distinct
and potentially contradictory, but that they also potentially enhance
one another. Understanding degrees of overlap between these logics is,
however, a difficult task. One potential path forward is to undertake
power-structure analyses (see Domhoff 2010) of military and economic
organizations in order to understand the kinds of goals they have set
for themselves and the strategies they have developed in order to
achieve them. As Downey and Strife (2010) wrote, such an organizational
analysis is not meant to supplant the treadmill models, but is instead
needed as a complementary form of research in light of the tremendous
complexity of the social world. [The]{.underline} particular [ways that
the logics of capitalism and militarism unfold are]{.underline}, after
all, variable and [contingent upon]{.underline} a number of [historical
factors]{.underline}.

Domhoff (2010) argued that [[the U.S.]{.mark} government [does not
**automatically privilege capital**]{.mark} accumulation [over]{.mark}
other potential [state objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, [[this
is something that]{.mark} members of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} American
[[upper class]{.mark} **actively [work]{.mark}** [to
achieve]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to Domhoff (2010), [the
wealthiest beneficiaries of]{.underline} U.S. [capitalism are
**organized [in a network]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- through shared
membership on corporate, think tank, and other non-profit boards -- into
what can be [[called a **corporate community**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
This network mobilizes resources in order to achieve government policy
goals that will benefit the corporate wealthy as a whole, without
privileging any particular economic sector (Domhoff 2010).

[The corporate community]{.underline} does not only [seek to
influence]{.underline} domestic policy, but U.S. [foreign
policy]{.underline} as well (Shoup 2015). This is not a surprise to many
environmental sociologists, who have long held that [U.S. **[capitalism
is dependent upon violence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in order ensure the
low-cost access to natural resources upon which it depends (Downey,
Bonds, and Clark 2010; Gedicks 2001; Gould 2007). Given [[this]{.mark}
[dependence]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is easy to understand why the
wealthiest Americans have, as a whole, [[support]{.underline}]{.mark}ed
a robust U.S. [military presence]{.underline} across the Western
Hemisphere since its early days as a nation, [and]{.underline} why they
now advocate for U.S. [[military dominance across the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pellow 2015).

But, just as capitalists often depend upon military power, [contemporary
**[militaries are also dependent upon capital]{.mark}
accumulation**]{.underline} (Wallerstein 2004). [There is a growing
cost]{.underline}, after all, [to expansionary military
policies]{.underline}. While these costs can be paid for by increasing
tax rates, this is also a recipe for domestic unrest. But[, [growing
economies]{.mark}]{.underline} can [[make paying for]{.mark}
the]{.underline} increasing [costs of [militarism
easier]{.mark}]{.underline} to bear. It is for this reason that
historical sociologists like Wallerstein (2004) and Arrighi (2010)
argued that [[military and economic dominance are **closely
bound**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that, [[as]{.mark} the [economic
supremacy]{.mark} of a nation [wanes, so too its military power
diminishes]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, while [the U.S.
military]{.underline} certainly, as an institution, seeks to influence
government policy to ensure its own growth (Mills 1956, Scheer 2008),
its officials also [depend upon an ever-expanding economy]{.underline}.

To use Giddens' (1987) apt phrase, [[states are '**containers of
power'**]{.underline}]{.mark} in that they set and enforce rules within
particular territories while also projecting power outward to jockey
with other nations. [[Both the **corporate community** and **military
institutions** seek to influence]{.mark} how and when that power will be
used]{.underline}. Domhoff (2010) argued that it is an open question
whether capitalists, military officials, or elites in some other
organization -- such as religious institutions -- hold the most sway in
any particular society. But, in the case of the U.S., the corporate
community is most influential. Even so, [both]{.underline} the corporate
community and the military make a difference in terms of
[determin]{.underline}ing [[U.S. policy]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} both [depend on]{.underline} -- [and plan
for]{.underline} -- [the other]{.underline}. [This **[mutual
dependence]{.mark}**]{.underline} and overlap between the corpo- rate
community [[goes]{.mark} **far [beyond]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
'[military-industrial complex]{.mark},']{.underline} or the
interconnected network of military branches and arms-producing companies
(see Hooks and Smith 2004; Gould 2007). Rather, [[the U.S. corporate
community is]{.mark}, as a whole, [dependent upon]{.mark} the **[global
projection of]{.mark} U.S. military [power]{.mark}**, [just as
the]{.mark} U.S. [military relies upon **continued capital
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as will be shown in an analysis of
corporate-connected think tank and military strategy planning documents
for the Arctic. But, before moving on to this analysis, it is important
to first consider the role of think tanks in U.S. society.

was the case for Britain in the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, simply [**[integral parts of
a colonial empire]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but rather take on even
greater importance, "*in the absence of colonialism.*" [**The U**nited
**S**tates, which has sought to maintain an imperial economic system
without formal political controls over the territorial sovereignty of
other nations, has **[employed]{.mark}** these **[bases]{.mark} to exert
force** **[against]{.mark}** those **[nations that]{.mark}** have
**[sought to break out]{.mark} of the imperial system**]{.underline}
altogether, or that [have attempted to chart an independent course that
is]{.underline} perceived [as threatening U.S. interests.
**[Without]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the worldwide dispersion of U.S.
military forces in **these [bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and without
the U.S. predisposition to employ them in its military interventions,
[[it would be impossible to keep]{.mark} many of the more dependent

[**[U.S. global]{.mark} political**, economic, and financial

**[military power]{.mark}**. The other advanced capitalist countries

**[positioning of]{.mark} U.S. [military bases]{.mark}** [should]{.mark}
therefore [be judged]{.mark} not as a purely military phenomenon, but
[as]{.mark} a **[mapping]{.mark}** out **[of the]{.mark}**

spearheads within the periphery. What is clear at present and bears
repeating is that such [[bases are]{.mark} now [being acquired]{.mark}
in areas [where]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States had previously
lost much of its "forward presence," such as in South Asia, the Middle
East/Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, or in regions where
[U.S. bases have **no[t existed previously]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such
as the Balkans and Central Asia. There can be no doubt, therefore, that
[the last remaining superpower is presently on a course of imperial
expansion, as a means of promoting its political and economic

in many ways an indirect product of the projection of U.S. power, is now
being used to justify the further projection of that power.

A central, conceptually under-appreciated aspect of the current
low-carbon transition is the corresponding [expansion in transition
minerals]{.underline}, and how this [connects to long-standing
**colonial-extractive dynamics** of **capitalism**]{.underline}.
[Producing electricity from renewable energies is currently ten times
**more mineral intensive** than doing so from **fossil
fuels**]{.underline} (Mastini et al., 2021, p. 5), and [there is a clear
consensus]{.underline} in policy and industry literature that a [shift
to renewables will entail an unprecedented [increase in **mineral
mining**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Barbesgaard & Whitmore, 2022; Hund
et al., 2020, p. 11). Therefore, we argue that expanding
industrial-scale renewables and transition mineral extraction should be
considered part of the same emergent regime, what we call the "green
energy--extractivism nexus".

This concept is informed by, but also moves beyond, Bainton and
co-authors' (2021) formulation of the "energy-extractives nexus".
[Defining capital-driven energy transitions as a form
of extractivism highlights not only the mineral intensity of such
transitions, but also how they [follow a **predatory logic** of **land
and**]{.mark} **natural [resource appropriation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Moreover, seeing the socio-ecological fix as extractivist points to the
ways that it ([re]{.underline})[produces uneven geographical relations
globally]{.underline} (Acosta, 2013; Vela Almeida, 2020). [From the
point of view of the countries where extraction takes place,
extractivism may be understood as a national, resource-based development
or **accumulation strategy**]{.underline} (Brand et al., 2016; Gudynas,
2016). [However, from the perspective of its political economy, it
should be approached as a **structural necessity** of
capital]{.underline}, inherently global in character, [and [linked with
**neo-colonial processes** of **commodity frontier expansion**]{.mark}
and reconfiguration]{.underline} (Arboleda, 2020; Moore, 2015).

The historico-geographical dynamic of [extractivism has been
**intimately imbricated** with colonialism]{.underline} (Machado Aráoz,
2014). As Luis Tapia (2014) argues in the case of Bolivia, the
systematic conversion of peasant economies into extractivist ones is a
core defining feature (a "constitutive moment") of colonialism,
[[establishing]{.mark} a [**hierarchical relation** where]{.mark}by [one
society]{.mark} is made to [work for another and is]{.mark} **partly
[disarticulated]{.mark}** [in the process]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today,
[extractivist expansion continues to insert indigenous and peasant
territories and economies into complex global production networks and
circuits of capital valorisation]{.underline} (Arboleda, 2020; Dorn &
Huber, 2020). [Even though such uneven geographical patterns are not
unchangeable]{.underline} and do not always conform to a clear
North-South or core-periphery binary---as the rise of China as the
epicentre of raw material demand and industrialisation demonstrates
(Arboleda, 2020)---[overall, they tend to **[reproduce and
reinforce]{.mark}** spatial and [power relations formed since colonial
times]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2.3. Green extractivism, dispossession and sacrifice

In recent years, the term "green extractivism" (Dunlap & Jakobsen,
2020; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022) has been introduced in political
ecology research to refer to the paradox whereby an [**[environmentally
destructive]{.mark}** mode of [extraction and accumulation]{.mark}
loaded with colonial legacies [is being promoted]{.mark} as a
**solution** to the ecological and climate crisis]{.underline}
(cf. Sultana, 2022).3 [Mining extractivism has long been presented [as a
vehicle of **modernisation**, **development** and
**progress**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Machado Aráoz, 2014). Since the
1990s, the mining industry and institutions like the World Bank have
dedicated increasing effort to framing mining as key to sustainable and
inclusive development (e.g., World Bank, 1996; Andreucci & Kallis,
2017). And, increasingly, resource extractivism is being repackaged not
only as compatible with planetary sustainability, but indeed as
essential for urgent and effective climate action (Hund et al., 2020).
Researchers working on lithium in South America, for instance, have
shown how transition minerals are imbued with novel imaginaries of
clean, high-tech development and industrialisation, capable of saving
the climate while ushering in an era of unprecedented prosperity and
geopolitical power for southern countries (Barandiarán,
2019; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022).

[These [techno-optimistic discourses find a counterpoint in]{.mark}
accounts]{.underline}, increasingly present in popular media, [of the
"dark side" of electric batteries, the most infamous case being that of
[**cobalt mining** in the]{.mark} Democratic Republic of
**[Congo]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sovacool, 2019). Overall, however,
[there is a clear tendency]{.underline} on the part of mainstream
development institutions [to present transition mineral extraction as
**necessary** for reducing emissions globally]{.underline}, endorsing
the World Bank\'s mantra that, if done correctly, mineral extraction
contributes to sustainable and "climate-smart" development (Hund et al.,
2020). This [strategy is accompanied by a [discourse of **universal
salvation**]{.mark} from climate change via the greening of the global
economy, which [obscures]{.mark} the **uneven**, **(neo-)colonial
[geographies of sacrifice]{.mark}** [upon which]{.mark} such [greening
is predicated]{.mark}]{.underline} (Zografos & Robbins, 2020).

There is broad evidence that [extractivism is associated with ecological
destruction, dispossession and violence]{.underline} (Menton & Billon,
2021). The [[systematic]{.mark} creation of [sacrifice zones of
**industrial pollution** and **waste**]{.mark} has long been denounced
by environmental justice movements]{.underline} (Lerner, 2012). Zografos
and Robbins' (2020) notion of "green sacrifice zones" expands on this
idea: [by adding the label "green"]{.underline}, not only does it signal
the contradictory dialectics between greening and sacrificing, but
[it]{.underline} also [spatializes this dialectic by **signalling the
divide** between territories or populations that are greened, and others
that are **sacrificed**]{.underline} (cf. Sovacool et al., 2020). It
highlights the spatial injustices traversed by neo-colonial hierarchies
and racialization of populations connected to global resource and energy
provision and use (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022).

[Decarbonisation plans based on expanding industrial-scale renewable and
electric technologies are giving shape to these injustices]{.underline},
whereby cities and industries in the North are increasingly striving to
achieve the status of low-carbon or "zero-emissions"; while
[[peripheries]{.underline}]{.mark}, primarily in the South (but also in
economically and politically marginalized spaces in the global North),
[[are being assigned the role of]{.mark} **extraction areas**, **waste**
or **carbon [dumps]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such, [decarbonisation is
becoming a widespread means of "**[accumulation by
dispossession]{.mark}**]{.underline}", embedded in neo-colonial patterns
of extractive capitalism (Bumpus & Liverman, 2008; Ojeda, 2014; Siamanta
& Dunlap, 2019; Sovacool et al., 2021; Yenneti et al., 2016).

importance of the Arctic as a geopolitical hotspot in world politics.
While economic reasons are an important driver for territorial
reorganizations in the Arctic, national security and defence issues also
play an important part in such processes. The reorganization of military
structures and the redefinition of military strategies and objectives in
the Arctic -- seen in Russia, in the US and Canada, encompassing all of
the Inuit homeland -- points to a tendency of increased control being
exercised over hyperborean spaces by States.

[The emergence of neo-extractivist capitalist development21) might be
the defining feature of emerging Arctic colonialisms. **Neo-extractivist
[capital accumulation is characterized by]{.mark}** pressure over
natural resources and the demand for greater **[capitalist control over

Despite the slowness of construction, [[there is one]{.mark}
**considerable [advantage]{.mark}** [to nuclear plants]{.mark} when it
comes to energy transition]{.underline}: electricity grid systems in
most intensively electrified countries are highly centralized.
Electricity production (e.g., at a power plant) is thus separated from
energy consumption (e.g., in the household), making it easier to
integrate nuclear power with the grid we already have. By contrast, due
to the nature of renewables like wind and solar---intermittency of
generation, low density, the need for geographic dispersion---switching
to renewable energy would require rewiring and transforming the grid;
some proponents argue for dismantling it entirely to build a new one.
This would surely take an enormous investment of time and labor given
the myriad obstacles, from zoning and planning commissions to private
property and already dwindling available land area. Even with very
heavy-handed government intervention---the prospects of which are never
a given in the United States---we could still reasonably assume it would
take a long time to fully reform the grid for renewables. On this score,
nuclear comes out the clear winner. [We have all this infrastructure
available for providing power generated at **massive economies of
scale**, and at least in principle, certain energy [providers could
**more readily slot** nuclear into]{.mark} this system **much faster**
than [a]{.mark} new [grid]{.mark} could be built]{.underline}. And once
nuclear plants are built, they can operate for decades: the
longest-running reactor was shut down in 2018 after 49 years of
operations, and some reactors today are projected to last 80 years.

But [this [ease may well prove a **double-edged sword**]{.mark}. Even if
electricity generation were to be fully provided by nuclear reactors,
[we would still live in a **fossil fuel economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In other words, while the ease of integrating nuclear onto the grid is a
strong point in its favor if our goal is simply to rapidly decarbonize
electricity, [embracing [nuclear would]{.mark} also [do little to
dismantle]{.mark} the **[rest of the infrastructure]{.mark}** of our
**existing carbon economy**. By contrast, decommissioning fossil fuel
infrastructure---not just power plants but **[grids and
mines]{.mark}**---opens up the possibility of **rethinking** how urban
and rural infrastructures are designed]{.underline}, how they interact,
and who they serve. Decentralized, distributed energy production like
renewables can have a broader disruptive impact on energy
infrastructures and how they interact with social and political
relations. Integrating distributed, small-scale energy generation within
towns and cities can make them more self-sufficient; whereas most people
now are alienated from their modes of energy production, bringing
production into their spheres of governance and living can alter that
relationship in positive ways. Neighborhood-controlled energy, for
instance, can have positive civic impacts, making towns more democratic
and profit-sharing more widespread. [Further integrating some form
of **[degrowth economics]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[such
as **circular economy principles**]{.underline}---[[could also
disrupt]{.mark} the [fossil economy]{.mark} even **[more
broadly]{.mark}**. [Nuclear is necessarily a **top-down energy
source**]{.mark}; solar and wind can be]{.underline} (though are not
inevitably) [a bottom-up energy source, particularly when paired
with **degrowth principles and policies**]{.underline}. [[Embracing
nuclear would leave]{.mark} many [status quo structural
relations]{.mark} **largely [intact]{.mark}**, given the way it [depends
on states, militaries, and
**c**]{.mark}**ommand-[and]{.mark}-[c]{.mark}ontrol
[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[A similar sort of bind is likely when it comes to jobs]{.underline}.
There are about 45,000 nuclear power employees in the United States.
(Some nuclear advocacy sites attempt to inflate this number by including
"secondary" jobs the industry creates, but these often include mostly
temporary construction jobs, which tend to be much lower paid and very
dangerous.) About 20 percent of U.S. electricity is generated by nuclear
power; scaling that up to 100 percent yields the potential for about
225,000 jobs total in the industry. According to the 2020 U.S. Energy
and Employment Report, 12 percent of workers employed in nuclear power
generation are unionized (though according to a 2017 industry Pipeline
Survey, that proportion could be as much as a third); advocates see
potential in increasing this share.

But who is likely to benefit from good unionized jobs? Climate and
environmental justice advocates emphasize the imperative to right both
historical and contemporary wrongs done to marginalized groups who have
suffered a disproportionate burden of environmental harm through
pollution or the impacts of climate change. The history of nuclear
energy in the United States is one of inflicting precisely this kind of
harm. As historian Traci Brynne Voyles documents in her
book Wastelanding (2015), the Navajo Nation has been particularly
afflicted by U.S. uranium mining; their land "hosts upward of 2,000
now-abandoned uranium mines, mills, and tailings piles," which "litter
the Navajo landscape, leaching radon gas into the air and water and
scattering radioactive debris throughout the ecosystem." [[Decisions
made about]{.mark} where [uranium]{.mark} is mined, where nuclear plants
are constructed, [and]{.mark} where [waste is]{.mark} stored have been
[informed by]{.mark} a logic of [**environmental racism** that renders
certain areas]{.mark} of land and its inhabitants
**[pollutable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Voyles notes that
"[[Radiation]{.mark}-related [diseases]{.mark} are [now endemic
to]{.mark} **many parts** of [the **Navajo
Nation**]{.mark}]{.underline}," [and]{.underline} that [researchers have
found among miners "increased incidents of **tuberculosis**,
**fibrosis**, **silicosis**, and **birth defects**, all linked to
exposure to uranium from mines and mills]{.underline}."

This context should give us pause. [Even if [scaling up nuclear]{.mark}
power did create many good, middle-class, high-skilled unionized jobs,
there is no reason to believe it [would]{.mark} not [continue to]{.mark}
depend on [exploit]{.mark}ing **[poor and marginalized
pop]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark}** whose jobs are neither practically
unionizable nor well-paid, and whose workers suffer the **brunt of the
dangers**]{.underline} of mining and waste. (It's also worth noting that
while renewable industries in the U.S. lag behind nuclear in its share
of unionized workers, there is no reason to believe renewable jobs are
intrinsically less unionizable than nuclear jobs.) [[There is]{.mark}
currently [a uranium rush
in countries]{.mark} like Namibia and Australia [with **weak regulatory
frameworks**]{.mark} for ensuring public and environmental safety,
and]{.underline}---given that many years can pass before symptoms of
radiation poisoning become apparent---[the [companies **taking
advantage**]{.mark} of those weak regulations [are **rarely held
accountable**]{.mark} for the damage they inflict]{.underline}. A [[vast

Among other global crises, the worsening impacts of climate change are
intensifying every year. Last year was the warmest on record and,
beginning in March 2023, raging wildfires filled cities across Canada
with smoke for months. This year is already shaping up to be warmer than
the last. This is why a lot of young people are questioning the very
systems we live under. This is why many of us support a rapid and just
transition in energy. But in this process, [some [governments are
promoting an **expansion of nuclear power**]{.mark}, supposedly to
**solve climate change**]{.underline}. I fear that such an expansion
will result in my generation having to confront an equally terrifying
set of problems resulting from the nuclear fuel chain.

This is precisely what I already see happening around me in the Canadian
province of [New Brunswick]{.underline} where I live and study. Over the
last few years, the province's government [has advocated for and funded
the development of what it calls small modular
reactors (**[SMRs]{.mark}**]{.underline}). [Even though SMR doesn't
include the word "nuclear," these are nuclear reactors. Ostensibly,
these reactors [are meant to **decarbonize** the]{.mark} Canadian
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. But in 2021, New Brunswick Energy
Minister Mike Holland protested the 2030 target for phasing out coal in
the province, saying new nuclear reactors would not be ready in time to
meet that goal. [How will the expansion of nuclear power decarbonize the
economy if]{.underline}, meanwhile, [New Brunswick is **[still
extracting and burning fossil fuels]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

The province has funded two companies---Moltex Energy and ARC Clean
Technology---to develop small modular reactors. On their websites,
Moltex and ARC market nuclear power as "clean," "carbon free," and a
"clean energy solution."

Last year, [Moltex CEO Rory O'Sullivan]{.underline} spoke to me, my
fellow students, and professors working on the Plutonium Project at St.
Thomas University in Fredericton, New Brunswick, in which we explored
these small modular reactors being proposed for the province to develop
an understanding of the assumptions, claims, and implications of these
technologies. I remember O'Sullivan as friendly and well-spoken. He
[emphasized that a transition away from fossil fuels is necessary and
that renewable energy is a **key element** in this
transition]{.underline}. Yet he told us that wind farms, for example,
could not generate enough energy to sustain our society, and that
battery storage was not advanced enough to help with this, and thus
renewables could not be considered an effective climate solution on
their own. This is why he advocates for small modular reactors---as a
necessary supplement to renewables in the energy transition. But, again,
he stressed that, at Moltex, they were working to reduce any potential
safety risks.

This made me wonder: [[What about the **highly radioactive
waste**]{.mark} these reactors will produce?]{.underline}

[[Even if SMRs produce less waste than past]{.mark} nuclear
[reactors]{.mark}]{.underline} ([although not when weighted by how much
electricity they produce]{.underline}), [spent [fuel will remain
**dangerously radioactive** for thousands of years]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[While]{.mark} nuclear [proponents]{.mark} have [argued]{.mark} that [a
deep]{.mark} geological [repository would be]{.mark} an [effective
storage]{.mark} space for the waste]{.underline}, there are many
uncertainties surrounding this proposal, and the [[**long-term impacts**
are **unknown**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The [proposed [sites]{.mark}]{.underline} for the repository [[are
located on]{.mark} **traditional [Indigenous
lands]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway Nation-Ignace
and Saugeen Ojibway Nation-South Bruce areas in Ontario. Because the
safety of the proposed repository is unproven, storing radioactive waste
there would [**[jeopardize]{.mark}** the [health]{.mark} of the local
Indigenous communities and their lands]{.underline}.

Moltex and ARC have advertised [[reprocessing]{.mark} as a way to
recycle waste]{.underline} and use it to power other reactors. However,
this [[is]{.mark} also **[incredibly dangerous]{.mark}**, because [once
plutonium is separated]{.mark} from used nuclear fuel, [it can]{.mark}
be used much more easily in the [produc]{.mark}tion of **[atomic
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If separated plutonium were to fall
into the wrong hands, the [result would be **nuclear
prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}---an increased number of nuclear
weapons across the globe.

In addition to the waste and proliferation problems, small modular
reactors will not be built and operating in time to be an effective
climate solution. Canada's climate targets involve decreasing greenhouse
gas emissions to 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and
reaching net-zero by 2050. However, ARC predicts that it will finish
building its first small modular reactor by 2028 which will "replace the
existing coal generation station in 2030" at Point Lepreau Nuclear
Generating Station in Saint John, New Brunswick. And Moltex does
not expect to have an "operational reactor" until "the early 2030s."

This timeline will clearly not help Canada reach its decarbonization
goal by 2030, and so the country will not be on track for the 2050 goal
either. Given these realities, I find it hard to believe that nuclear
power is in the best interest of humans, non-human species, or the
planet as a whole.

[[Capitalist nations that prioritize]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}** [above all else, such as the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and Canada,
[[have normalized]{.mark} the **[exploitation of nature]{.mark}**. This
has [happened with]{.mark} the extraction and combustion of [**fossil
fuels**, and]{.mark} it [will happen again with]{.mark} the
**[radioactive waste]{.mark}** produced by new nuclear
reactors]{.underline} if humans do not learn from past mistakes. It is
hard enough to deal with the large stockpile of radioactive waste
produced by conventional nuclear reactors that were built during the
late 20th century, when the public and even experts knew less about how
difficult this material is to deal with.

This is [the [U.S. **liberal order**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [is
[premised on]{.mark} **well-functioning [markets]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
the capacity of free, profit-seeking individuals to generate **[economic
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "[**Nothing** is more tied to energy use
than **economic activity**]{.underline}," writes
[O'Sullivan]{.underline}, [point]{.underline}ing [to the [**global
surge** in energy demand from 1997--2007]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[was when China's]{.mark} economic [growth reached a high]{.mark} of
**14 percent**]{.underline} (growth hovers around 2 percent in Europe
and the United States); by 2007, China accounted for nearly a fifth of
global energy demand. Today, this is visible in China's smog-filled
megacities as well as the proliferation of Chinese-made goods in
American homes (from iPhones to Ivanka Trump shoes). Notably, it has
also lifted millions of Chinese people out of poverty, swelled the ranks
of China's middle class, and offered them a particularly American kind
of freedom: the freedom to express one's identity through mass,
conspicuous consumption.

China is not alone. Notwithstanding the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement,
which the United States is now the only country to reject,
[international trends still point toward the **globalization** of
fossil-fueled consumerism]{.underline}. [Over the last five years,
[global fossil fuel use]{.mark} has **continued to [rise]{.mark}** [at
an average of]{.mark} almost [1 percent a year]{.mark}, or the
equivalent of about 678 million barrels of oil]{.underline}, as of the
latest estimates. [[Growth and carbon]{.mark} **still [go hand in
hand]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Controlling]{.mark} the source of all this
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course, also [[translates into]{.mark}
**geopolitical [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and Windfall is ultimately
concerned with how the United States can capitalize on the boom [to
bolster]{.underline} its **[[superpower status]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Above all, this [[means]{.mark} further [expanding U.S. **fossil fuel
production**]{.mark}, including [by **reducing
regulations**]{.mark}]{.underline} and maintaining free-trade policies
like NAFTA. (O'Sullivan sees Europe at an economic disadvantage: the
EU's high price on carbon makes it more expensive for companies to
pollute, meaning that European companies, enticed by inexpensive U.S.
natural gas, may relocate across the Atlantic.) [By capitalizing on this
"new energy position," the United States can also promote its **own
vision of freedom**, strengthening its **global influence** (by helping
other]{.underline} countrie[s develop their oil and gas
resources]{.underline}) [and promoting its **national security
interests** (by sanctioning unfriendly oil exporters to combat
terrorism]{.underline}). This is no protectionist, anti--free trade
vision of "energy independence" à la Trump. For O'Sullivan, further
integrating the U.S. economy with Canada's and Mexico's would create a
North American energy corridor to rival OPEC in influence---a vision
that is also, incidentally, shared by the oil industry associations of
all three countries and several big investment banks.

Windfall is a neat encapsulation of how ideology reproduces itself---the
confluence of interests that create their own motor of
self-justification. O'Sullivan's sprawling list of appointments and
credentials include Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and
Afghanistan under George W. Bush; professor of international relations
at Harvard's Kennedy school; member of the Council on Foreign Relations
and the Trilateral Commission; and "strategic advisor" to the CEO of
Hess oil and gas. In many ways, she is at least as useful of an ally to
fossil-fuel companies as the gaslighting climate deniers. Her "realism"
helps enforce the status quo.

In this way, O'Sullivan is perhaps less removed than it might seem from
some of her counterparts on the left. Windfall basically affirms the
present order, imagining a future that differs from the present only in
how power is distributed between nation-states, and in the emergence of
new technologies like fracking. This may not be surprising coming from
an alumnus of the Bush administration. What is more surprising is to
find such "strategic realism," as Imre Szeman labels it in Energy
Humanities, reflected in the "apocalyptic environmentalism" of the
left. The latter school imagines that [[climate change will
precipitate]{.mark} the [**collapse** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[capitalis]{.underline}]{.mark}t syste[[m]{.mark}---and that
"**nothing** can be done to stop the **disaster** from
coming]{.underline}."

It's hard to avoid the feeling that, at least when it comes to stopping
the disaster, they might have a point. Just look at Asia, says Ghosh,
where 60 percent of the world's population resides. Population density
alone will make climate change especially disastrous there: [[rising sea
levels]{.mark} could [cause]{.mark} up to **125 million people** to
migrate from India and Bangladesh; the [desertification of China's
farmlands]{.mark}, which [feed **20 percent** of the world]{.mark}'s
population]{.underline}, is already causing direct annual losses of \$65
billion; [and the [rivers of]{.mark} Tibet and [the Himalayas]{.mark},
[which sustain 47 percent]{.mark} of the world's population, [are
**drying up**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the region warming at twice the
global average rate. These headline-grabbing examples from the world's
most populous continent illustrate all too neatly that "We needn't do
anything---other than [[what we are]{.mark} already
[doing]{.mark}]{.underline}---to [[endanger]{.mark} the **future** of
[our species]{.mark}]{.underline}," as Lifton writes.

Still, if the only post-capitalist vision that the apocalyptic
environmentalists have to offer is of capitalism's smoldering ashes,
aren't they just conceding, as Windfall does, to capitalism's total
power over our minds and world? The confluence of these two seemingly
opposite schools of thought points to a deeper challenge. As both
O'Sullivan and Ghosh observe, Asia's carbon-fueled economic
transformation is also one of the main drivers of climate change,
providing billions of Asians with access to consumer freedoms and
amenities that the West has long enjoyed (and advertised via the movies
and culture it has exported throughout the world). No wonder that
national governments across the political spectrum view economic growth
as a key measure of national strength.

"[We do not succumb easily to the troubling paradox that the same fossil
fuels that have so benefited our civilizing processes now **threaten our
future**]{.underline}," writes Lifton. [[This is compounded by]{.mark}
our [failure]{.mark}, as a society, [to envision **alternative
futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}---trapped as we are between the twin
poles of apocalypse and business as usual. [Rarely, then, has it been
more incumbent on [the left]{.mark} to [offer that **missing
vision**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[The fact that [**laissez-faire** ideas]{.mark} are still dominant
within the Anglosphere [is]{.mark} therefore itself [**central** to the
climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}," writes Ghosh. "[Global [warming
poses a **powerful challenge** to]{.mark} the idea that the [free
pursuit of individual interests]{.mark} **always** leads to the
**general good**]{.underline}." If that vision of freedom must be
abandoned, what comes next?

[For fossil fuels, Ross]{.underline} \[86\] [finds a tendency for
**[reliance on oil]{.mark}** (and non-fuel mineral) wealth to [have
**antidemocratic effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in poor
countries. [The link between oil and authoritarianism may be [due to a
combination of]{.mark} **social and political [factors]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} work to **[demobilize the public]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Hall and Klitgaard \[100\] see a historical [connection between the
access to petroleum]{.underline} and the concentration of economic and
political power as noted, evidenced for example by the consolidation of
the oil industry. This energy source and its associated accumulations of
wealth and power are co-evolutionary historical anomalies. Lohmann and
Hildyard \[37\] similarly argue that the combination of fossil fuels
with heat engines [and **commodified labor** in the context of
capitalist political economies has [enabled]{.mark} processes of
**[extraordinary accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Earlier societies
had discovered and used steam engines and fossil fuels, but not in a way
directed entirely for processes of accumulation. In this sense, [modern
energy companies are financial as well as technical firms, pursuing
consolidation of both **energy and capital**]{.underline} \[37\].
Likewise, Malm \[1\] proposes that [[fossil fuels provide]{.mark} the
**[requisite infrastructure]{.mark}**, sustained through public
institutions, [that allows transnational energy firms to exploit]{.mark}
the [**inexpensive labor** needed for]{.mark} the **accumulation of
globally mobile [capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Mitchell \[49\], \[87\] uncovers important differences between forms of
fossil fuels and the ways they are co-produced with modern democracy.
Unprecedented access to concentrations of non-renewable stocks of
hydrocarbons in the form of coal contributed to the rise of mass
democracy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, due in
large part to the need for labor to extract and transport coal through
relatively narrow, dispersed and interconnected channels. These
[conditions gave workers in mines, railyards, and docks new and
[**unprecedented political power**, exercised]{.mark} especially
[through **general strikes**]{.mark} that would slow, disrupt or [shut
off]{.mark} entirely the [access]{.mark} of increasingly urbanized and
industrialized societies [to]{.mark} these **[sources of
energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In response and in effort to weaken
working-class mobilization, the industry and its political allies
yielded to pressure for welfare democracy and universal suffrage.
[[Oil]{.mark}, on the other hand, [could be moved more readily]{.mark}
from one region to another [with less need for **clusters of
workers**]{.mark}. The [**desire to control labor** as well as to
**protect profits**]{.mark} from transnational competition
[elicited]{.mark} first [the shift from coal to oil and]{.mark} then the
[consolidation of]{.mark} the oil [industry]{.mark} within a handful of
**transnational companies**. These shifts served to **[limit democratic
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} through the latter half of the twentieth
century \[49\].

Although there may be no inherent quality of fossil fuel sources that
demands concentrated political power, or vice versa, it appears that
[some forms of fossil fuels, petroleum sources in particular, are
**especially compatible** with concentrated political and economic power
due to the ways that they are made to be concentrated and their effects
to **demobilize populations**]{.underline}. There appears to be some
consensus supporting the possibility that concentrated forms of energy
and energy technology tend to enable and be enabled by concentrations of
political power, although the relationship varies across sources and
technologies.

One of the defining aspects of [[Technocapitalism is]{.mark} the
[**growing influence** of **techno-corporations**]{.mark}]{.underline},
reshaping the traditional power dynamics and market structures within
the capitalist framework.

In the digital age, the game of [[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[evolved to **exploit intangibles**]{.underline}]{.mark} such as
personal data, information, and personally identifiable information
(PII). This shift marks a new frontier in economic strategies.

At the core of the techno-corporate ascendancy lies the recognition of
data as the new currency. Tech corporations leverage vast datasets to
gain insights, predict consumer behavior, and drive innovation. The
strategic use of data becomes not just a tool but a fulcrum upon which
economic power tilts.

The [rise of techno-corporations]{.underline} has [given rise to a
landscape characterized by **market dominance** and oligopolistic
trends]{.underline}. A select few entities command significant market
shares, [**[shaping]{.mark} entire [industries]{.mark}** [and
influencing]{.mark} the [**trajectory** of **technological
progress**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The concentration of power prompts
reflections on competition, access, and market dynamics.

As techno-corporations amass unprecedented power, ethical considerations
come to the forefront. The intersection of profit motives and societal
responsibility raises questions about the impact of techno-corporate
decisions on privacy, security, and the equitable distribution of
technological benefits.

Technocapitalism\'s Innovation Hub: From R&D to AI and Robotics

At the core of [Technocapitalism]{.underline} lies a dynamic innovation
landscape. It [encompasses]{.underline} not only traditional
technological Research & Development (R&D) but also ventures into the
realms of [**[AI]{.mark}**, **massive [automation]{.mark}**, and
**humanoid [robotics]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The conventional landscape of Research & Development, once confined to
laboratories and experimentation, has undergone a metamorphosis. In the
realm of Technocapitalism, the emphasis on continuous or systematized
invention and innovation has propelled R&D beyond the traditional
confines, turning it into a dynamic force that is vital for
organizational survival.

Artificial Intelligence emerges as the linchpin of the Innovation Hub,
pushing the boundaries of what was once deemed possible. The integration
of AI technologies introduces unprecedented levels of data analysis,
pattern recognition, and decision-making capabilities. This, in turn,
facilitates innovations that transcend the limitations of conventional
approaches.

The Innovation Hub extends its influence into the realm of Robotics,
sparking a revolution that stretches from automation to the creation of
humanoid entities. Robotics, once confined to manufacturing processes,
has evolved into a multifaceted domain encompassing everything from
autonomous vehicles to human-like machines that redefine the concept of
interaction and assistance.

Technocapitalism\'s new ecology [thrives in the **[Innovation]{.mark}**
Hub]{.underline}, [with **[biotech]{.mark}**nology,
**[nanotech]{.mark}**nology, **[bioinfo]{.mark}**rmatics,
**[genomics]{.mark}**, **[synth]{.mark}**etic
**[bio]{.mark}**engineering, **[molecular computing]{.mark}**, [and
**biorobotics**]{.mark} taking center stage]{.underline}. This diverse
array of activities reflects a shift towards an innovation-centric
ecosystem that relies heavily on creativity, knowledge, and continuous
discovery.

"Accumulating Extinction: Planetary Catastrophism in the Necrocene",
*Anthropocene or Capitalocene? Nature, History, and the Crisis of
Capitalism*, pp 124-125\] 吳

The return of catastrophism did not come from the upheavals of the Great
Depression but from the system of total war that matured across the two
world wars. [**[Military-industrial production]{.mark}** began to
[entrench itself in **civilian life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was [led
by chemical firms finding justification for]{.underline} the continued
[production of **poison gas** by transposing its surplus for use in a
"**war on insects**]{.underline}" (Russell 2001). Here an eradication
mentality, structured by metaphors of parasites and pests, sustained a
new phase of the Necrocene. In the military-industrial production
regime, [[capitalism attempted to save itself]{.mark} from destruction
[through]{.mark} the **absolute [intensification]{.mark}** [of
destruction]{.mark}. The [apotheosis]{.mark} of this process [would be
**Hiroshima and Nagasaki**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Capitalism]{.underline} found in the Atom Bomb the dark watery
reflection of its own image. It [realized that its [logic could only
lead to]{.mark} one thing: **[total extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
It realized it had become the Necrocene.

Catastrophism's reemergence owes much to the Bomb and its unanticipated
side effect in global fallout. [Climate science came of age in the [Cold
War "**techno-politics**]{.mark}" of altitude]{.underline} (Edwards
2010, 215). [A complex web of satellites, numerical weather models, and
weather modification now [drove a growing global network of **data
capture** that aimed at **planetary surveillance**]{.mark}.
This]{.underline} atmospheric techno-politics [was a [reaction
to]{.mark}]{.underline}---and catalyst of---[the rapid expansion in the
spatial and temporal [scales of **ecological
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Experts studying the Bomb's environmental
effects came to see humanity as a planetary actor in a fragile, finely
tuned system---one that postwar humanity threatened to annihilate
(Hamblin 2013; Edwards 2012).

[[Prometheanism]{.mark}, the view that humans could and indeed should
control nature, [went hand-in-hand with a **new catastrophism**]{.mark}.
At its center of was a new **cult of expertise**. [American world power
justified]{.mark} expert political [authority through]{.mark} the
[necessity of managing]{.mark} the hazards set in motion by [its
**permanent war economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But these [experts'
authority derived from]{.underline} more than a promise to mitigate
catastrophic risks; it also owed much to [their proclamations that such
risks were **unavoidable**]{.underline}---[and outside of **political
deliberation**]{.underline}.⁶ This was the birth of the biosecurity
state. Vannevar Bush's Science: The Endless Frontier (1945) justified
this cult of the expert in his reappropriation of Turner's frontier
thesis (1898). [Bush proposed a new, macho, **techno-utopian ideology**.
The [scientist was]{.mark} became a **gunslinger** in a sidereal wild
west, [an **imperialist fantasy** that would overcome]{.mark} the
[contradictions of **capitalist surplus
extraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Endless Frontier as scientific
exploration was really the Endless Frontier as commodity expansion:
apocalyptic fears of extinction would be vanquished by utopian fantasies
of techno-omniscience. [The scientized discourse of environmental risk
[obfuscated]{.mark} the close [relationship between **economic and
environmental inequality**]{.mark}. This [excused]{.mark} the system of
production that threatened **[environmental catastrophe]{.mark}** by
framing humanity as]{.underline} an undifferentiated mass that had
become [a "planetary agent]{.underline}."

The notion of the "[[socio-ecological fix]{.underline}]{.mark}" was
introduced by critical geographers in recent years, to [[refer to
any]{.mark} intervention or [strategy that]{.mark} "directly engages
with and resolves, mitigates, or [postpones a **structural
impediment**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[including any environmental
one]{.underline}---[[to **sustain**]{.mark}**ed [capital
accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (McCarthy, 2015, p. 2495). The
socio-ecological fix approach, as outlined by McCarthy (2015) and others
(e.g. Ekers & Prudham, 2015), [places emphasis on how capitalism
responds to crises through **socio-ecological** and **spatial
reconfigurations**]{.underline}. Specifically, [[climate change is
associated with]{.mark} interlocking [crises of **accumulation and
hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, the ongoing climate and
ecological catastrophe, as well as [[reduced access to]{.mark} **easily
available resources** such as [fossil fuels]{.mark}, present
**short-term [challenge]{.mark}s** and aggravate **structural
impediments** to sustained capital [accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Second, [this is [linked with]{.mark} an [**increasingly visible
crisis** of]{.mark} hegemony or [legitimacy]{.mark} of global
capital]{.underline} (Fraser, 2022; Mann & Wainwright, 2018), to the
extent that the association of capitalism with fossil fuels is [[leading
more]{.mark} and more people [to identify capitalism as the **main
culprit**]{.mark} of climate change]{.underline}.

Following McCarthy (2015), we suggest considering [[mainstream **energy
transition plans**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including versions of the Green
New Deal, as [[attempt]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[to fix such]{.mark}
interlocked [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. This expands on Harvey\'s
concept of the "spatial fix", by placing additional emphasis on how
nature is appropriated and "produced" in the process in new ways
(McCarthy, 2015, p. 2489). [[Fixing]{.mark} is meant here in a **double
sense**: as solving or **[stav]{.mark}ing [off]{.mark}** [accumulation
crises]{.mark}, at least partly and temporarily; [and]{.mark} of doing
so by "[fix]{.mark}ing" [capital into the]{.mark} **built
[environment]{.mark}** in ways that give rise to novel socio-ecological
arrangements]{.underline} (Ekers & Prudham, 2017). This also resonates
with the idea and critique of a depoliticising "techno-fix" to
socio-environmental issues (Clark & York, 2012).

The [current demand [boom for renewables]{.mark} and associated
technologies may [provide **new outlets** for]{.mark} investing
**[over-accumulated capital]{.mark}**, pushing new rounds of **primitive
accumulation**]{.underline}. All the while, [it helps to address the
crisis of legitimacy by [present]{.mark}ing [capital not as the cause of
global heating but]{.mark} as [the **way out of
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}: energy, extractive, and financial capital, as
well as [neoliberal governments]{.underline} and international
institutions, [[refashion]{.mark} themselves [from villains to **global
saviours**]{.mark} of both climate and economy, **[shifting
blame]{.mark}** unto the depoliticised materiality of fossil fuels or
CO2, and to **individualized citizen-consumers**]{.underline} (Supran &
Oreskes, 2021; Swyngedouw, 2010).

[Thinking of decarbonisation plans as a **globally operating
socio-ecological fix** suggests that [what they aim to save
is]{.mark}]{.underline} not so much the climate, but
**[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}** (McCarthy, 2015). This is only an
ambition and future potentiality. [[There is **no evidence**]{.mark}
that [capital is being saved by]{.mark} **increasing investment** in
[green tech]{.mark}nologies, nor are there guarantees that this will
happen in the coming years and decades. However]{.underline}, this
framing allows us to stress that the core logic or concern of the
(uneven and contradictory) global [effort to transition away from fossil
fuels through private investment in renewables]{.underline} is to
[[leave]{.mark} **dominant power relations** and **[political economic
arrangements intact]{.mark}**, while **staving off accumulation crises**
associated with capital-induced climate disruptions]{.underline} (Mann &
Wainwright, 2018).

The sudden appearance of the [[land-question in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark} between the two contenders in the recent
Indonesian presidential elections [[remind us that struggles over
landownership run as a **red thread** through the history of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite the enormous changes in the
relationship between capital accumulation and peasant economies, there
is an enduring aspect to this story. Regardless of the many different
forms that the private property of land under capitalism takes, in
Marx's words in Capital, Volume III it always "presupposes that
[[certain persons enjoy the monopoly of disposing of particular portions
of the globe as **exclusive spheres of** ]{.mark}**their private will**
to the exclusion of all others]{.underline}." And [because]{.underline}
this process of [exclusion is]{.underline} historically [connected to
[expropriation and displacement]{.mark}]{.underline}, colonialism and
conquest, financial speculation and environmental degradation, [dealing
with [land has never ceased to put **dirt on the hands**]{.mark} of all
the members [of the ruling class]{.mark} that get involved in
it.]{.underline}

In this text, I want to focus on an elementary question: why does the
'agrarian question' have such longevity under capitalism? As with all
elementary questions, providing an answer is not simple. The concrete
processes by which peasant economies are integrated into the world
market vary profoundly from epoch to epoch, between different regions of
the world and ecological zones, and depending on the specific
characteristics both of the agents of capital and of the pre-existing
social relations on the land at the point of their encounter.
Integration is never a straightforward process, and often includes
compromises of dazzling complexity between old aristocracies, new
rent-seekers and oligarchical capitalists, as well as between all the
landholding classes, the state and small producers. The outcome, in many
cases, diverges from a stereotypical pattern of capitalist agriculture
envisioned by some socialist thinkers, in which capitalist development
would lead to fully proletarianised farm-labourers working on
factory-like, mechanised mega-farms -- although there are, of course,
plenty of instances in which agricultural capitalism takes this form.¶
These observations taken together have provided the starting point of a
long debate among Marxist thinkers. It goes back to Marx himself. As is
well known, working out the theory of ground rent, which explained how a
class of landlords that was ostensibly outside of the core capitalist
dichotomy of workers and industrial bourgeoisie laid claim on part of
society's surplus value in the form of rent without thereby negating the
law of value, was a key problem that Marx had to solve in order to be
able to write Capital. Even after he had worked out this problem
theoretically, his desire to find historical explanations for the many
variations in the concrete forms taken by landed property in Europe, the
white settler colonies, India and Russia kept Marx from finishing his
manuscripts for Volume III. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth
century, the agrarian question divided Russian Marxists and Populists
and led to a famous polemic between Lenin and Kautsky. Throughout the
twentieth century, developmentalist economists and dependency theorists
assigned the question of the division of land an important role in
attempts of the colonised, semi-colonised and former colonised nations
to escape from poverty. These were never abstract debates. Communist
movements in many parts of the world found themselves in the frontlines
of revolts of the peasantry and the rural poor against the landowners.
Paradoxically, and to the detriment of these often heroic movements,
'state socialism' also proved to be an aggressive dispossessor of the
peasantry in its own right.¶ The continuing importance of the agrarian
question throughout the history of capitalism directly links to the
theme of 'primitive accumulation' discussed by me in the previous
articles on this website. In Capital, Volume I, Marx deals at length
with the commodification of land and the often violent destruction of
rural communities as decisive 'original' preconditions for capitalist
development. However, some of the complexities facing Marxist authors on
this question arise from the very same source. If capitalist development
is predicated on the destruction of pre-capitalist agrarian social
relations, how then can these pre-capitalist relations continue to hunt
the capitalist system as it matures? I believe one crucial element of
the solution to this question is acknowledging that for Marx, the
privatisation of land and dispossession of the direct producers on the
one hand, and the introduction of the capitalist mode of production
proper in agriculture are both moments of capitalist development, but
not necessarily the same or consecutive moments. There is no doubt that
Marx saw the first two as preconditions of capitalist development. But
the latter, he treated only as its long-term result. This division is
very clear in a passage inCapital, Volume III, which explicitly builds
upon the discussion of 'primitive accumulation' in Volume I.¶ In the
section on "primitive accumulation" we saw how this mode of production
presupposes on the one hand that the direct producers are freed from the
position of a mere appendage of the soil (in the form of bondsmen,
serfs, slaves, etc.) and on the other hand the expropriation of the mass
of the people from the land. To that extent, the monopoly of landed
property is a historical precondition for the capitalist mode of
production and remains its permanentfoundation, as with all previous
modes of production based on the exploitation of the masses in one form
or the other. But the form oflanded property which greets the capitalist
mode of production at the start does not correspond to this mode. The
form that does correspond to it is only created by the capitalist mode
of production itself, through the subjection of agriculture to capital;
and in this way feudal landed property, clan property or small peasant
property is transformed into theeconomic form corresponding to this mode
of production, however diverse the legal forms of this may be.\[Italics

1864-1865. The passage itself was fully included in Engels' edition of
Volume III.\]

The longevity of this 'embracement by degrees', in my view, poses less a
theoretical problem and more a series of concrete historical problems,
in the same way that the ultimate decision which parts of human life
become commodified and which parts not depends on historical conditions
and not on a theoretical limit to commodification under capitalism per
se. Expanding onto the terrain of landed property, [capitalist forms of
exchange and production face at one and the same time a whole string of
concrete limiting conditions]{.underline}. [[**Land is the main source
of wealth** of]{.mark} all preceding [ruling
classes]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It is the material foundation
of]{.underline} subsistence economies and the [communities]{.underline}
on whose labour they are based. [[It is the first point at which
nature]{.mark} itself [intervenes in production and sets]{.mark} its
[**ecological barriers** on]{.mark} capitalism's social metabolism, [the
**socially mediated interaction** between human beings and their
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is the]{.mark} territorial
[foundation on which state sovereignty is built]{.mark}]{.underline},
and a key source of state revenue. Sometimes, [rapid
expansion]{.underline} of the system [pushes capitalists and the state
to charge all of those barriers at once, even at the risk of social
warfare]{.underline}. Sometimes, temporary moments of stagnation or
contraction might transform the agricultural borderlands of capital
accumulation into the ideal buffer zones in which to "lose" a
superfluous part of the labour force (Marx's reserve army of labour), or
on which to dump part of the costs of social reproduction (to use the
term popularised by socialist feminists such as Tithi Bhattacharya).
[The great variety of [legal forms under which the **economic
encroachment** by capital takes place]{.mark}, [often]{.mark} allows an
uneasy balance between advance and consolidation to [appear
as]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[pure preservation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of tradition. However, as Jairus Banaji has shown extensively in his
studies of the relationship between peasants in Southern India and the
world market, [[what appears as tradition]{.mark} often [consists of
new]{.mark} creation of intermediary [forms under the aegis of **global
capital**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some of the [[most desperate political struggles]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the last few years [[have been over **the control of
land**]{.underline}]{.mark}, from the expropriation of native lands to
allow for the building of oil pipelines in North America to the
murderous attacks on the Movement of Landless Workers (MST) in Brazil.
For greedy politicians and large landowners, however, this is a time of
opportunities. The current phase of globalisation has ushered in new
waves of agricultural reform. In this present conjuncture, global
agrobusiness even more relentlessly than in the past subjects local
production systems to the dictates of the world market, frequently while
branding itself 'socially responsible' and 'environmentally friendly'
for the sake of western middle class consumers. This process of
subjection involves all sorts of backhand deals with large landholders
and speculators at the expense of peasant small producers, who under
neoliberalism lack even the minimal protection previously provided by
developmentalist states. The [[voraciousness of this new wave is]{.mark}
further [deepened by]{.mark} the impact of [climate change]{.mark}, that
undermines the resources for resistance of poor communities against
multinationals and local states.]{.underline}

However, even the latest phase of capitalist globalisation and land
reform will not simply resolve the agrarian question for capitalism, by
dissolving all traditional titles on land into a single category of
commercial land-holding and by dividing the majority of the rural
population into capitalist farmers and proletarians. As the Marxist
agrarian historian Henry Bernstein noted in his seminal article from
2002,

just as agribusiness capital is increasingly consolidated through
'globalization' ..., so is labour in the world of contemporary
capitalism increasingly structurally fragmented, especially in the
South. This fragmentation -- manifested, inter alia, in the stagnant or
declining opportunities of (relatively) stable wage employment, the vast
extent of the urban 'informal sector', and the (re)structuring of labour
markets, rural and urban -- also connects with the class dynamic at work
in agricultural petty commodity production.

The aim of landed property in this new phase remains, as Marx said, to
carve out whole portions of the globe as exclusive spheres of the
owners' "private will to the exclusion of all others". But this
[[private will never goes unchallenged, however wealthy and powerful the
individuals that wield it]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Logistics\-\--1NC

#### Military logistics are a neoliberal enterprise that both sustain and necessitate the continuation of capital.

**Cowen '14** (Deborah Cowen, PhD, Professor at the University of
Toronto in the Department of Geography, "The Deadly Life of Logistics:
Mapping Violence in Global Trade" 2014, University of Minnesota Press
https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt7zw6vg //vo)

Key to these transformations is the rise of new "transversally bordered
spaces that not only cut across national borders but also generate new
types of formal and informal jurisdictions . . . deep inside the tissue
of national sovereign territory" (ibid.). This book argues not simply
that logistics spaces are one form of emergent jurisdiction among many
that challenge the authority of national territoriality but rather that
[**[logistics]{.mark} is a driving force in the transformations** in
time, space, and territory **that [make globalization]{.mark}** and
recast jurisdiction. A ubiquitous management science of the government
of circulation, **logistics** has [been **crucial** in]{.mark} the
process of time--space compression that has **remade geographies of
[capitalist production]{.mark} [and distribution at a]{.mark}
[global]{.mark} [scale]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The politics of circulation are at the forefront of a number of threads
of scholarship today---but which forms of circulation are we talking
about? On the one hand, circulation refers to material and informational
flows, and there is a growing body of scholarship considering the
government of circulation in this vein. Much of this work emerges in
conversation with Foucault's lectures collected in "Security, Territory,
Population," in which he outlines the rise of a form of government
concerned with the management of circulation (Foucault 2007, 65).
Tracing the emergence of what he calls "security" in town planning,
Foucault traces the encounter with "a completely different problem that
is no longer that of fixing and demarcating the territory, but of
allowing circulations to take place, of controlling them, sifting the
good and the bad, ensuring that things are always in movement." More
broadly, there is a dynamic and growing body of literature in the
interdisciplinary study of "mobilities," which interrogates the
radically undervalorized role of movement and circulation in everyday
life (Sheller and Urry 2006; Sheller 2011). This sense of circulation
([**[the]{.mark} [movements of things]{.mark}**, data, and people)
**[is]{.mark}**]{.underline} our common sense of the term, but it stands
in some contrast to the notion at work in the study of **[the
[circulation of capital]{.mark} through its different
forms]{.underline}**. Indeed, this latter notion of circulation, perhaps
most rigorously taken up in Marx's Capital, volume 2, is also at the
center of contemporary debates---but about the political economy of
crisis. While debates about circulation are experiencing resurgence,
these different forms of circulation elaborated on in distinct
literatures and networks rarely collide. [Yet **[it is]{.mark}**
precisely **[the]{.mark}** shifting **[relationship between]{.mark}**
the **[circulation]{.mark}** of stuff **[and]{.mark}** the circuits of
[**capital** that is]{.mark} at stake in the story of
[logistics]{.mark}]{.underline}. I suggest that on offer at this
intersection is a vital political history of the economic space of our
present.

[**[Logistics entails]{.mark}** not only "transversal networks" but a
suite of **other [spaces that underpin
circulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}---nodes, chokepoints, "bunkers" (cf.
Duffield 2011), borders, and overlapping jurisdictions such as cities
and states. [The **making of logistics** space **[challenges]{.mark}**
not only the inside/outside binary of **[national
territoriality]{.mark}** but also the "tidy" ways that modern warfare
has been organized along national lines]{.underline}. In his classic
account, Charles Tilly considers the long histories of European state
formation that were defined by contestation between capital accumulating
networks of mercantile cities and the territorially bounded coercion of
military states. For Tilly (1990, 19), "[**[Capital defines]{.mark} a
realm of [exploitation]{.mark}**," whereas "**[coercion
defines]{.mark}** a realm of **[domination]{.mark}**]{.underline}."
Importantly, Tilly allows that "coercive means and capital merge where
the same objects (e.g., workhouses) serve exploitation and domination."
If, as I assert in this book, the revolution in [**[logistics]{.mark}**
transformed the factory into a disaggregated network of production and
circulation, then arguably the supply chain as **[reformed]{.mark}**
workhouse is a paradigmatic and expansive **[space for]{.mark}** the
entanglement of **[exploitation and domination]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Indeed, while Tilly's intervention is typically remembered for its
separation of these two organizations of power---capital/city and
coercive state---he nevertheless marks the historical expansion of both
forms. "Over time," he writes, "[the place of capital in the form of
states grew even larger, while the influence of coercion (in the guise
of policing and state intervention) expanded as well]{.underline}."
Indeed, as I argue in the pages that follow, the story of capital and
coercion is not an either/or. [As the title of this work hints,
**logistics** space **is [produced through]{.mark}** the intensification
of both **[capital circulation and organized
violence]{.mark}**---although in ways that might be difficult to
recognize.]{.underline}

As Donald Trump prosecutes his trade war and muses about sacking Jerome
Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, analysts are poring over
the data---and they are seizing on the smallest dips in stockmarkets and
rises in inflation as proof of harm. Take a step back, though, and what
is striking is how calm it all is. Over the past decade the global order
has been upended by populists, authoritarians and war. Yet, as we
explain this week, the economy is powering on, unfazed. Aside from a
brief contraction as covid-19 lockdowns went into effect, global gdp has
grown at a respectable annual clip of about 3% since 2011. Across the
rich world, unemployment is near a record low. Both America's S&P 500
and the global MSCI index of stocks are near record highs.

This resilience, a Teflon-like superpower, is cause for celebration. It
means that the twin scourges of recession and unemployment have been
kept at bay. The trouble is that [**threats** are now
**mounting**]{.underline}. Because [governments do **not appreciate**
the economy's **resilience**]{.underline}, [they are **undermining**
the]{.underline} fundamental [sources of its **strength**]{.underline}.

To see the danger, consider first what has propelled the long expansion.
Around the world, [economic policy now cushions demand more
effectively]{.underline}. After the long agony of the global financial
crisis, rich-country governments decided that [decisive **fiscal
stimulus** was the best way to **avert** economic **pain**]{.underline},
and low interest rates made their interventions affordable.

Meanwhile, policy in the emerging world improved. The number of
inflation-targeting central banks rose to 34 in 2022, from five in 2000.
More governments let their exchange rates float and issued debt in local
currency, sheltering them from the vagaries of American interest rates.
That helped stave off debt crises even as rates rose and commodity-price
spikes made life harder for importers.

More stable demand has been met by increasingly flexible supply. During
the pandemic, early shortages of masks and chips convinced politicians
that markets could not be trusted. In fact, supply chains responded
quickly: hand sanitiser was churned out by the gallon; shipments of
chips spiked in 2021. More recently, a glut of oil---thanks in part to
America's shale drillers---meant that even as Israel and then America
bombed Iran, the price of crude barely budged.

You should be worried, therefore, that [the **fundamentals** of Teflon
capitalism are now looking **shaky**]{.underline}. The costs of activist
policies are mounting. [Politicians]{.underline} in the rich world
[spent more than **10% of GDP** shoring up **demand**]{.underline}
during the pandemic; those in [Europe allocated]{.underline}, on
average, [another **3%** during the **energy** crisis]{.underline}.
[Interest **rates**]{.underline} on ten-year government debt [now
average 3.7%]{.underline}, [**up** from 1%]{.underline} during the
pandemic.

Yet because voters increasingly expect the state to step in, and [fiscal
**consolidation** is hard]{.underline}, [debts are **ratcheting**
up]{.underline}. Even as the economy hummed along last year, [America
ran a deficit of 7% of GDP]{.underline}. [Britain's attempt to cut
benefits]{.underline} for the disabled [ended in tears]{.underline};
[French pension reforms seem]{.underline} just as [doomed]{.underline}.
With every increase in the fiscal burden today, [governments' ability to
step in]{.underline} next time trouble hits [is sorely
constrained]{.underline}.

Moreover, the instinct to protect now extends to supply chains.
[**Prices** play a **crucial** role in a market economy]{.underline},
sending signals about what is scarce and what is plentiful. But
[**governments** are seeking to **override** them]{.underline} in the
name of sparing voters' wallets and jobs. According to the imf, [the
rich world had 1,000 industrial-policy measures in place]{.underline} in
2022, up from 100 in 2017. While Mr [Trump uses
**tariffs**]{.underline}, [the European Commission is relying on
**subsidies** and **strictures**]{.underline}; it is reportedly mulling
a plan for its school-meal scheme to buy food locally.

All [this will]{.underline} only [make **supply chains** more
**brittle**]{.underline}. The pandemic revealed that diversified supply
was more resilient than local production, which could be taken out by a
lockdown or natural disaster. And [governments are hardly the best
backers of new supply]{.underline}. The biggest triumph of American
reshoring, the rise of the shale industry, came about not because of
policy, but because entrepreneurs spied an opportunity.

History shows that [economies do **not** stay **stable** for
**ever**]{.underline}. [The longer an expansion]{.underline}, [the
**more**]{.underline} politicians, [investors and companies take
**risks**]{.underline}, [**hastening** its **demise**]{.underline}. On
July 16th Mr Trump said that he was "highly unlikely" to sack Mr Powell.
If he were to change his mind, undermining the central bank's
independence, the placidity of the past decade would be put to the test.
The economy has surprised so far; it could surprise for a while still.

THE GLOBAL ENERGY CRISIS

As of mid-2021, few would have claimed that we face something like a
global energy crisis---in the sense of a crisis of fossil fuel supply,
not simply of its climactic effects. But February 2022 changed all that.
Putin's [**invasion** of Ukraine **triggered**]{.underline} what the IEA
describes as "[the first truly **global energy crisis**]{.underline}": a
series of [price **shocks** in natural **gas**, **oil**, **coal**, and
**electricity**]{.underline} markets that [rocked]{.underline} most of
[the world-system]{.underline}, with Europe and import-dependent states
in the global south bearing the brunt.101 European natural gas prices
rose tenfold between February 2021 and August 2022 as Russian gas
deliveries fell by 80%. Rising demand for liquified natural gas (LNG)
and coal to meet shortfalls helped push up coal and LNG prices around
the world. Brent crude briefly reached over \$123 per barrel---tripling
above its lows in early 2020 and reaching its highest levels since
2008---and remained well over \$100 for months before declining to \$76
as of June 2023 (due to looming recession fears). The [social and
political **consequences** were **immense**]{.underline}: 70 million
[people across the **global south** lost access to
**electricity**]{.underline}; low-income [populations]{.underline} in
rich countries were [forced to choose between "**eating or
heating**;"]{.underline} oil and gas [**companies** enjoyed **record
profits**]{.underline}; and rich countries (particularly in Europe)
considered or adopted previously unthinkable measures---including
windfall taxes on energy companies, price caps, and energy rationing.102

How should we explain this crisis? It is clear that [energy price
**inflation** was]{.underline} merely [**turbocharged**, not caused, by
the Ukraine war]{.underline}: oil, gas, and coal [**prices** had been
**steadily climbing**]{.underline} over the course of 2021, the result
of rapidly rebounding energy demand following the COVID-19 lockdowns,
along with regionally specific exacerbating stressors (e.g., a brutal
2020--2021 winter and [**low** gas **storage**]{.underline} in Asia and
continental Europe, [**drought**-induced constraints on hydropower
production]{.underline} in China and Brazil, [coal
**shortages**]{.underline} in India, [and **slow** summer **wind**
speeds]{.underline} across Europe).103 Beyond these proximate causes,
many [analysts agree that **underinvestment**]{.underline} in oil and
gas [was a deeper **structural cause**]{.underline}: after a period of
elevated prices between 2008 and 2014, the "shale revolution" led to an
oil and gas supply glut in 2014--2015 that forced oil and gas companies
to scale back on investment in exploration and production; [investment
in **renewables**]{.underline}, meanwhile, [was **far** from
**sufficient** to compensate]{.underline} for any potential shortfall in
fossil fuel supplies.104 This was only made worse by the pandemic shock,
which temporarily demolished oil demand by a third and plunged oil
prices to historic lows in April 2020, leading to a 30% contraction of
capital expenditures in the oil and gas sector.105

There is no question that "underinvestment" is a key cause of the
crisis. But it begs the question of why this has become such a problem
in the first place, leading many in the oil and gas sector to speak of
"structural supply under-investment."106 Periods of low prices by
themselves are an insufficient explanation, especially given recurrent
projections from the IEA and others of continuously rising oil and gas
demand plus depletion from existing fields. Some analysts put the blame
on net zero climate policies: as the [fossil fuel **lobbyists** have
recently **argued**]{.underline}, by calling for the eventual
**[phaseout]{.underline}** of fossil fuels, [governments are
**disincentivizing**]{.underline} oil and gas
**[investment]{.underline}** in the present [and thus
exacerbating]{.underline} supply [shortfalls]{.underline}.107 The
argument has logic, but so far **[little evidence]{.underline}**: as the
[IEA shows, **net zero pledges** across sixty-eight
countries]{.underline} plus the EU [are "**not**]{.underline} yet
[**correlated** with changes in fossil fuel spending]{.underline}"
relative to countries that have not adopted such pledges.108

Rather, to make sense of structural underinvestment and gain a deeper
understanding of the current energy crisis, we should turn to a concept
developed by ecological and biophysical economists: energy return on
energy investment (EROI), or net energy. **[EROI]{.underline}** refers
to the [net]{.underline} or surplus **[energy]{.underline}** that is
[**left over** after **subtracting** the amount of **energy used** to
obtain that energy]{.underline}, which includes the energy used directly
in the extraction process (e.g., to pump oil and gas out of the ground),
[as well as]{.underline} the [energy used indirectly in]{.underline}
various stages of [its lifecycle]{.underline} (e.g., the energy used to
manufacture a power plant or oil rig, or to deliver the energy to its
point of use).109 For example, conventional oil flowing from the giant
"elephant" fields like Ghawar in Saudi Arabia has a high EROI (estimated
at about 40 units of energy extracted for every unit of input, or 40:1)
and relatively low production costs, whereas unconventional oil sources
like US shale, the Canadian and Venezuelan oil sands, offshore and
arctic oil have significantly lower EROI (estimated at about 7:1 for
offshore and between 2:1 and 3:1 for shale and oil sands).110 While
mainstream energy analysts typically neglect the framework of EROI, they
are at least partially aware of its implications when they highlight the
increased capital intensity and higher break-even price of
unconventional oil and gas compared to conventional sources---that is,
the fact that oil prices must be around \$60--\$80 per barrel or higher
to turn a profit for shale and oil sands, compared to \$20--\$40 for
conventional fields (though different analysts come to widely different
estimates).111 By itself, the more conventional focus on break-even
prices goes a long way toward understanding the current energy crisis:
[as the]{.underline} world [**economy** becomes more **reliant** on
**unconventional**]{.underline} oil and gas [reserves that require
**larger** upfront]{.underline} capital [**expenditures**, the
**investment** case for new]{.underline} oil and gas
**[exploration]{.underline}** steadily
**[weakens]{.underline}**---particularly given the poor financial
performance of US shale companies, who are now being disciplined by
investors to focus on boosting shareholder returns rather than
increasing production, as well as the large uncertainties about future
demand and price trajectories in an era of energy transitions.112

But this does not give us the whole story. From a mainstream economic
perspective, the only significant constraint on fossil fuel supply is
economic or financial, not geological: that is, a shortage of investment
to extract the earth's vast reserves of burnable carbon. Indeed, when
viewed through the lens of total resources, the [amount]{.underline} of
oil and gas [that remains]{.underline} to be extracted [is
enormous]{.underline}. But [net energy **analysis** shows]{.underline}
us that [what]{.underline} really [matters is the **total energy**
extracted **minus** the **energy needed** to extract]{.underline} and
deliver that energy to its point of use. Thus even though total fossil
fuel resources remain huge, [global **EROI decline** can
**constrain**]{.underline} economic [**growth** by reducing]{.underline}
the [net energy available]{.underline} for the rest of the economy,
since this means a greater share of energy and capital must be devoted
to the energy sector.113 Indeed, this is what the historical record
shows: for most of the twentieth century up until 1960, when (according
to Charles Hall) average EROI for fossil fuels was approximately 60:1,
energy spending as a share of global GDP averaged about 3%--4%. Yet, [in
the **past decade**]{.underline}, when Hall estimates that average
fossil fuel EROI declined to about 17:1, [energy **spending
doubled**]{.underline}, to roughly 6%--8% of GDP on average---reaching a
record 13% of GDP in 2022.114 Thus it is likely [no coincidence
that]{.underline} the **[peak-EROI]{.underline}** era [**coincided**
with the "**golden age**" of Keynesian capitalism]{.underline}, while
[**declining** average **EROI**]{.underline} in the past thirty years
has been [**associated** with]{.underline} the era of "**[secular
stagnation]{.underline}**."115

Furthermore, a crucial point, which EROI scholars often emphasize, is
that [net energy **decline** is a **nonlinear** process]{.underline},
since the net energy available for the rest of the economy decreases in
a nonlinear fashion once EROI dips to between 10:1 and 5:1---[a
phenomenon they call the "**net energy cliff**."]{.underline}116 In
other words, the difference between an EROI of 10:1 and 5:1 is larger
than the difference between 50:1 and 10:1, and there is an even larger
difference between 5:1 and 3:1. The concept of percentage net energy
gain can help provide more clarity on this phenomena: an EROI of 50:1
means that 98% of the energy created is made available to (or "gained"
by) the non-energy sectors of the economy, which falls to 90% with an
EROI of 10:1; subsequently, the net energy gain falls to 80% with an
EROI of 5:1, to 75% with an EROI 4:1, to 66% at 3:1, and to 50% at
2:1.117 Notably, it appears that the [world **economy** may already be
**moving down** the slope]{.underline} of the net energy cliff: when
using an "EROI final" methodology that accounts for the total energy
invested in refining and delivering energy to the point of use, Paul
Brockway and colleagues show that average EROI for all fossil fuels
falls to somewhere between 5:1 and 6:1.118 While such calculations
should be taken with a grain of salt, considering major uncertainties
and methodological disagreements regarding EROI calculations, they
nonetheless suggest, as the authors write, that "[we]{.underline} may
already [have entered this zone of]{.underline} highly [nonlinear
change]{.underline}, where [**further** modest **declines**]{.underline}
in \[EROI\] [**lead** to]{.underline} increasingly [**rapid reductions**
in]{.underline} the net [energy available]{.underline} to society."119

The theory that we may be nearing a net energy cliff for fossil fuel
EROI is no doubt speculative. Furthermore, average global EROI estimates
can only teach us so much, since they overlook important differences
between different fuels and their production costs in different regions.
But if the theory is roughly accurate, then it means we may be
confronting a period of [nonlinear decline]{.underline} in the net
fossil energy available for the world economy, which would [**manifest**
in the form of an increasingly large share of]{.underline} global
**[GDP]{.underline}** and energy consumption [being **devoted** to the
**energy** sector]{.underline}---meaning **[less]{.underline}** energy
and [capital **available** for the rest]{.underline} of the
economy---and a long-run [trend toward **rising**]{.underline} energy
[**costs**, elevated]{.underline} supply [**risks**, and]{.underline}
economy-wide **[inflation]{.underline}** that may get continuously worse
as fossil fuel EROI continues to decline at a nonlinear rate.120

Even if we are not really facing a net energy cliff, but simply a period
of structural underinvestment caused in part by EROI decline, then this
still bodes ill for energy security in the coming years (particularly
for oil security, the dominant energy source globally). As the [**IEA**
projects]{.underline} in its "stated policies" scenario, [oil **demand**
will **grow**]{.underline} to 103 million barrels per day (mb/d) by the
mid-2030s and then very slowly decline until 2050. Yet [low
**investment** in recent years **means**]{.underline} "there are
[relatively **few** new **resources** under development and a
**dwindling** stock of discovered resources]{.underline} in the non-OPEC
world available to be developed," while "persistent under-production"
among OPEC producers relative to their targets "may be a harbinger of
the risks that lie ahead."121 As the IEA concludes (in
uncharacteristically stark terms), "[Something has to change in order to
avoid an **energy-starved world**]{.underline} characterised by
continued price volatility."122 The situation may be less critical if
oil demand tracks more closely with British Petroleum's (BP)
projections, which, in their post-Putin shock "new momentum" scenario,
anticipate oil demand plateauing around 100 mb/d until 2030 before
slowly declining.123 But (as I elaborate in chapters 4 and 5), the
[energy security **situation** may be even **worse**]{.underline} come
2030 than both BP and the IEA anticipate, [due to their **unrealistic
assumptions** about US shale **production**, unexpected
**headwinds**]{.underline} that may constrain OPEC production, their
limited incorporation of [energy **rebound effects**]{.underline},124
their [**neglect** of increased demand pressures from]{.underline}
ramped-up [**militarization**, and ignorance of]{.underline} the impacts
of [worsening **climate chaos**]{.underline} on energy infrastructure.
In sum, the net energy cliff hypothesis is not essential to the argument
that we confront significant fossil fuel supply risks in the coming
years. But it suggests that the energy problem may be deeper and less
tractable than most analysts realize. It would mean that we may be
facing not just a series of transitory price spikes, but rather [a
**looming contradiction** between]{.underline} the growing [energy
**demands** of global capitalism and the **shrinking**]{.underline} net
fossil **[energy]{.underline}** that will be [available]{.underline} in
the coming years.

Yet all of this depends on the speed and ultimate course of the
renewable energy transition. As the IEA says, given the looming
contradiction between underinvestment in fossil fuels and projected
rising demand, a "surge in spending to boost deployment of clean energy
technologies and infrastructure provides the way forward, and this needs
to happen quickly or global energy markets will face a turbulent and
volatile period."125 In short, if business-as-usual is leading us toward
a future of worsening climate-energy-economic polycrises, then an
accelerated energy transition appears to be the "poly-solution" we
need.126 Is renewable energy up to the challenge?

[**Global** fractures]{.underline}

China's global ascendency, combined [with]{.underline} the [US's
political fracturing]{.underline}, has [led]{.underline} some
[to]{.underline} speculate that we may be witnessing the
'[**[end]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[American]{.mark}
[century']{.mark}**]{.underline}. Back in 2020, I argued that such
premonitions were premature. The [two pillars of]{.underline} the US's
[global power]{.underline} -- [military and financial]{.underline} --
remained rooted in place.

However, it was clear that the election of
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in]{.underline} 20[16]{.underline} was
[eroding]{.underline} the [US's soft power]{.underline}, and its ability
to act as the [[paragon]{.mark} [for]{.mark} liberal
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's [subsequent attempt to overturn
the result]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the 20[20 election]{.underline}
only [put this on **steroids**]{.underline}. Far from being viewed as a
successful model to emulate, the [US began to resemble a **cautionary
tale** to avoid]{.underline}.

Biden made a conscious effort to repair US prestige on the world stage.
"America is back," he vowed at his first address to world leaders from
the State Department in February 2021. "We are a country that does big
things. American diplomacy makes it happen. And our Administration is
ready to take up the mantle and lead once again."

However, [polling]{.underline} undertaken [in]{.underline}
20[21]{.underline} [found]{.underline} that while [most people in
Europe]{.underline} were happy to see Biden elected, they
[believed]{.underline} that the [US political system was
"broken]{.underline}". Perhaps [most alarmingly]{.underline} for US
strategists, [a]{.underline} [majority]{.underline} also
[believed]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [China]{.underline} [would be
more powerful than the US within a decade]{.underline} -- and said they
would want their country to stay neutral in a conflict between the two
superpowers. In the years since, [Biden's]{.underline} international
[standing]{.underline} has been further [stained]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} his resolute [support]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
Israel's brutal assault on [Gaza]{.underline}, which has
[generated]{.underline} [intense animosity]{.underline}
[towards]{.underline} the [US in many parts of]{.underline} [the
world]{.underline}.

Despite Biden's efforts, it is likely that a [second Trump
term]{.underline} will [**fracture** relations]{.underline} in the West
[further]{.underline}, [as tensions relating to
**[tariffs]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**Ukraine** and
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} [start to bite.]{.underline} How this
plays out remains to be seen, any prolonged [souring of
relations]{.underline} among Western countries would likely [benefit
China,]{.underline} [and hasten]{.underline} [the transfer of global
power from West]{.underline} [to East]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the much-vaunted '[rules-based international]{.underline}
[order']{.underline} looks [more fragile than]{.underline}
[ever]{.underline} before. Under [Trump]{.underline}'s first reign, the
US [pulled **funding** from]{.underline} [multiple UN
agencies]{.underline}, [[withdrew]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Agreement on climate change, and even pulled out of [[the]{.underline}
**[W]{.underline}**]{.mark}orld **[[H]{.underline}]{.mark}**ealth
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization (WHO) during the Covid-19
pandemic. Meanwhile, Trump and his allies severely
[criticised]{.underline} institutions such as the [IMF]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [World Bank,]{.underline} [long]{.underline} [a
critical tool for projecting US power]{.underline}. At the same time,
the [number of countries]{.underline} turning to Chinese-backed
alternatives to fund development projects and
[joining]{.underline} [China's]{.underline} **[B]{.underline}**elt and
**[R]{.underline}**oad **[I]{.underline}**nitiative has [continued
to]{.underline} [grow]{.underline} over the past decade.

In recent months, the ongoing [war in]{.underline} the [**Middle East**
has]{.underline} [exposed]{.underline} the **[feebleness]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [international law]{.underline}, with multiple
signatory countries openly defying the International Criminal Court's
(ICC) arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister and former defence
minister. The US has never become a signatory to the ICC, but
[Trump]{.underline} previously [sanctioned two ICC
prosecutors]{.underline} after they began investigating whether US
forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan -- with secretary of state
Mike Pompeo declaring it as a 'kangaroo court'. At the start of this
year, the US House of Representatives voted once again to sanction the
ICC in retaliation for its arrest warrants against Israeli leaders.

What [[Trump's]{.mark} [stance]{.mark} towards]{.underline} such
[**international** institutions]{.underline} will be [in]{.underline}
his [second term]{.underline} remains to be seen. But with his "[America
first]{.underline}" stance [**[unlikely]{.underline}** [to
**soften**]{.underline}]{.mark} anytime soon, the so-called '[**crisis**
of multilateralism' looks **set to deepen**]{.underline}.

A global wake up call

Overall it is clear that [Trump's re-election]{.underline}
[represents]{.underline} [a [critical]{.mark} [**turning point** for the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}. While his first victory represented a
high-risk gamble into the unknown, this time Americans fully knew what
they were voting for. [Far from softening]{.underline} the
**[[autocratic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[tendencies]{.underline}]{.mark}
he was widely criticised for, [he has **[doubled
down]{.mark}**]{.underline} on them.

Towards the end of Trump's last reign, I argued that the
[West]{.underline} was being [haunted]{.underline} [by the spectre
of '**[authoritarian]{.mark}
[capitalism]{.mark}**[']{.mark}]{.underline}. The analysis identified
three [profound economic and political shifts]{.underline} that were
[[reshaping]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Western]{.mark}
[economies]{.mark}]{.underline}: a **[[China-induced
pivot]{.underline}]{.mark}** away [from]{.underline} [free-market
orthodoxy]{.underline}, a [clampdown on democratic
freedoms]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} a [rise in state
surveillance]{.underline}. Together, these shifts
[[represented]{.underline}]{.mark} a distinct political
[economy]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, if not contained, [could usher
in]{.underline} a new age of more [[authoritarian
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Thanks to the emerging transatlantic alliance between Trump, the
European far-right and billionaire social media moguls, this is a
reality we now face. Exactly what Trump will do in power, and whether
his far-right allies in Europe will succeed in following his footsteps,
is impossible to predict. But we should be under no illusions about the
threat that this alliance poses. [This is not the]{.underline} [same
Trumpism]{.underline} that won the election [in 2016]{.underline}: it's
an altogether [different]{.underline} -- [and more
**dangerous**]{.underline} -- project. How should progressives seek to
counter the ascendance of a new authoritarianism?

One thing is clear: [stoking [anti-China sentiment]{.mark} will
[not]{.mark} [cure]{.mark}]{.underline} the [ills of Western
capitalism]{.underline}. The **[[roots]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of]{.underline} these [problems]{.underline}, and therefore their
solutions, can be found [much closer to home]{.underline}. Simply
[trying]{.underline} [to ban]{.underline} or censor [voices]{.underline}
on the authoritarian right [won't work]{.underline} either.
[When]{.underline} the [voices]{.underline} in question
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} [[US
president]{.underline}]{.mark} and the second most popular party in the
beating heart of Europe, silencing them isn't an option (although
that hasn't stopped hundreds of German politicians from trying).
Instead, the [roots]{.underline} of these problems [need to be dealt
with at the source]{.underline}. In reality, it is not China or
immigrants that are screwing over ordinary working people, but [an
[**extractive** and **unequal** economic system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--Economy\-\--2NC

#### Economic growth is [unsustainable]{.underline} and causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--capitalist [technology]{.underline} and [policies fail]{.underline}.

**Compassiviste '25** \[Compassiviste; January 16; Non Profit
Organization for Environmental Sustainment; "Overconsumption: The
Unsustainable Core of Capitalism",
https://compassiviste.com/overconsumption-the-unsustainable-core-of-capitalism/\]

At the heart of [capitalism]{.underline} lies a profound paradox: Its
success [hinges on a **relentless** cycle of **overconsumption** and
waste that threatens the very foundations of our planet.]{.underline}
While generating immense wealth and innovation, [capitalism]{.underline}
has also [cultivated a culture]{.underline} of insatiable desire and
disposability, [where **profit maximization** often trumps environmental
and social well-being]{.underline}. Modern [capitalism thrives on
perpetual growth, intrinsically linked to overconsumption]{.underline},
a phenomenon where societies consume beyond their basic needs. This
dynamic perpetuates both ecological destruction and social inequality.

[Economic **growth**]{.underline}, a key indicator of capitalist
success, is fueled by increased production and consumption. This
[creates a dependency on ever-expanding markets,]{.underline} leading to
artificial demand and planned obsolescence. A constant barrage of
advertising reinforces this behavior[, creating **artificial needs**
that fuel the cycle of consumption]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the true
[environmental and social costs of production are]{.underline} often
**[externalized]{.underline}**, allowing corporations to profit while
society bears the burden.

The relentless [pursuit of profit necessitates a **constant expansion**
of]{.underline} markets and [consumption]{.underline}. This has led to
manipulative marketing tactics and planned obsolescence. From fast
fashion to disposable electronics, our economy thrives on disposability,
driving further consumption. The [**environmental consequences** are
staggering: Resource depletion, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions
push our **planet** toward ecological **collapse**.]{.underline}

[Tech]{.underline}nological advancements, often touted as solutions,
have largely [failed to address the **root cause**:
overconsumption]{.underline}. Electric vehicles, while reducing tailpipe
emissions, still rely on a resource-intensive production process and
encourage car ownership. Similarly, [renewable]{.underline} energy
sources, while [crucial for **decarbonization**]{.underline}, often
[have significant environmental impacts in their production and
disposal.]{.underline}

The pursuit of wealth and material possessions has become a driving
force, leading to a culture of excess where consumption is equated with
success. This throwaway culture further strains the planet's resources
and contributes to widening inequality. The insatiable [**greed** that
drives overconsumption is deeply rooted in the history of
**capitalism**]{.underline}, creating a system where the wealthiest
amass fortunes at the expense of the planet and its inhabitants.

The [capitalis]{.underline}t syste[m]{.underline} [relies on continuous
consumption]{.underline}, creating a paradox [where]{.underline}
individuals must consume more to maintain their jobs, even as
overconsumption depletes resources. [The **working class is
trapped**]{.underline}, compelled to participate in a system that
ultimately [benefits the wealthiest at the expense of the environment
and future **generations**]{.underline}.

The pursuit of profit and economic growth at any cost has led to a
disconnect between human well-being and the health of the planet. The
current [economic system prioritizes **short-term gains** over long-term
sustainability, creating a system that is **inherently
unsustainable**.]{.underline}

To break free, we must fundamentally rethink our relationship with
consumption. [We need a shift away from **endless growth** and profit
maximization toward a more sustainable and equitable economic
system]{.underline}. This could involve promoting circular economies,
investing in public transportation and affordable housing, and
challenging the culture of consumerism.

In conclusion, [capitalism's reliance on overconsumption is
**unsustainable**, threatening the future of our planet]{.underline}.
While [tech]{.underline}nological [advancements and policy interventions
offer some relief,]{.underline} they [**cannot resolve** the underlying
**problem**.]{.underline} To create a truly sustainable and equitable
society, we must move beyond the pursuit of endless growth towards a
more balanced and responsible approach to consumption. Only then can we
hope to create a world where joy and sustainability coexist
harmoniously, ensuring a livable future for all.

### Sustainability\-\--Kaya Identity

#### [Continuous]{.underline} economic growth is unsustainable and makes it [impossible to decouple]{.underline}\-\--[Kaya Identity]{.underline} proves.

**Malerba '22** \[Daniele; 2022; Senior Researcher at IDOS, Expert in
Socio-ecological Transitions; Yannick Oswald; "GOVERNING THE
INTERLINKAGES BETWEEN THE SDGS", Chapter 9, Pg. 140-158, 'To Grow or Not
to Grow? Revisiting Economic Growth as a Sustainable Development Goal in
Light of the Degrowth Debate'\]

While the [SDGs]{.underline} are formulated in a way that [does not
question **economic growth** and does **no**t put any **limits** to
environmental degradation,]{.underline} we have shown that [continuous
economic growth is very **problematic** for **environmental**
dimensions]{.underline}. In fact, reaching the Paris Goals is nearly
impossible under high economic growth and past trends of decoupling
rates. We have shown this by developing a simple model of economic
growth and Kaya decomposition. [Rates of **decarbonization** of energy
and past improvements in the energy intensity of GDP are **far from the
ones needed** if continuous economic growth is achieved]{.underline},
both globally on aggregate and across countries. These empirical
findings question the sustainability of the SDGs and emphasize the need
to use other approaches, more linked to the Doughnut framework rather
than the SDG index, where [economic growth is a means rather than an
end]{.underline}. Furthermore, we have illustrated the fact that income
growth still grants enough degrees of freedom for particular social
dimensions to evolve in any direction, but yet the [relationship between
income and social outcomes overall is robust enough that "satisfying all
(]{.underline}development[) goals under all (environmental) constraints"
is a]{.underline} very [**hard problem to solve**.]{.underline}

Here we have shown that whatever new systems are to emerge, [**economic
redistribution**]{.underline} has the potential to play an important
part. It [reduces the need for aggregate growth and thus helps
**mitigate** trade-offs between collective well-being and
**environmental constraints**]{.underline} (Malerba, 2020). However, it
is important to note that this only includes the direct effects of
redistribution. We did not consider systemic and dynamic implications of
greater equality. For instance, let us assume the world is completely
equitable at \~\$PPP 20,000 GDP per capita per year: We do not know what
policies it requires to ensure a steady state at that level of income
(one can think through the same argument in terms of material
throughput). It is possible that widespread [high living
standards]{.underline} encourage further entrepreneurial activity for
instance and thus might [trigger feedback towards **renewed** and more
**economic** **growth**]{.underline}.

What are the policy implications? Despite the limitations discussed, a
first implication for policy makers is to focus on international and
national redistribution. [**Inequality** must be **lowered** through
economic transfers and progressive taxation but potentially also through
more heterodox approaches such as income and wealth caps.]{.underline}
Internationally, [**redistribution** should]{.underline} move beyond
development aid alone and focus on [set]{.underline}ting [up **fair
trade** systems between countries of the Global North and the Global
South]{.underline} in the first place. For instance, this could include
giving Global South countries threatened by climate change higher voting
power (possibly proportional to population or the specific issue at
hand) in international financial institutions like the International
Monetary Fund (IMF, 2022). In the long term, a more [equitable
**international governance** will then likely contribute to an
international levelling of income]{.underline}, although we cannot make
any precise statements about such futures.

Second, it is important to note that in any case, if we want to raise
prosperity to much higher standards (let us say Costa Rica household
expenditure levels as in our minimal scenario) for everyone on the world
within the next decades, [technological improvements and societal
adoption of these technologies must proceed very fast]{.underline}.
After all, the [**necessary** GDP-carbon **decoupling**
rates]{.underline} we have [found are very **high**]{.underline} even in
the minimal high prosperity scenario (Costa Rica levels). Therefore, it
is very important to further push the diffusion of renewable energy and
energy efficiency by carbon pricing and subsidies for green and
renewable energy wherever possible.

A third policy implied through [international redistribution of income
and wealth]{.underline} is that a better consideration [of **degrowth
needs to happen**]{.underline}, including improvements in its scientific
understanding through scenario-modelling. For example, just a few
scenarios and Integrated Assessment Models ([IAMs]{.underline}),
including the ones that the [I]{.underline}ntergovernmental
[P]{.underline}anel on [C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange uses,
[include decreasing energy use.]{.underline} This is mainly a normative
issue; in fact, scenarios for the future all envisage economic growth,
such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. [**Reduced energy use** in
those scenarios is a consequence of very large increases in energy
efficiency.]{.underline} But there are limits to energy demand reduction
especially in economically growing regions focusing on
industrialization. While [**fully decarbonizing** the supply of energy
is **possible**]{.underline}, it has been estimated that a 10% increase
in GDP per capita corresponds to an 8.9% increase in primary energy,
with the relationship flattening at very high level of economic growth
(Semieniuk, Taylor, Rezai, and Foley, 2021).

Recent research has shown that [**degrowth** would **reduce** many
**risks** in achieving emission targets]{.underline} (Keyßer and Lenzen,
2021), especially linked to the issue of using negative emission
technologies that is present in many models, however, it remains
critical to understand the political economy barriers that make degrowth
unpopular. One solution focuses on wording (Drews and Antal, 2016). It
has been found that [focusing on the **promotive** rather than
preventive **nature of degrowth** increases its support]{.underline};
one example is framing degrowth as a future of "radical abundance" in
contrast to the popular perception of "scarcity" implied (Hickel,
2019a). In addition, neo-classical economics that are the basis for IAM
models advocate for technological and top-down solutions (which are
easier to model and less normative), while degrowth requires more
bottom-up socio-cultural change (Semieniuk et al., 2021). It would be
naïve to simply replace the very high and unprecedent technological
change rates in current scenarios by very high rates of socio-cultural
change as degrowth proponents suggest. Both theories of change on their
own are possibly overly idealistic. However, [there are now large
international social and climate movements pushing for
change]{.underline} (e.g. Fridays for Future). Such movements constitute
one critical aspect of system themselves, the social force that brings
about change. Scenarios can do justice to the technological and social
progress, and in fact to the whole of the Sustainable Development Goals,
if they further investigate the conditions which bring about rapid
technological change and social change, rather than just assuming it.

Some time ago I stumbled upon the concept of the **[[Kaya
Identity]{.underline}]{.mark}** while listening to a recorded lecture by
the French climate-energy guru Jean-Marc Jancovici. It's a [simple
[equation]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[describes]{.underline}]{.mark}
man-made [CO2 emissions as a function of **four
[variables]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The [population]{.underline}, the
production per person ([GDP]{.underline}), [the energy
intensity]{.underline} of the economy [and the carbon
content]{.underline} of energy.

\[\[FIGURE ONE OMITTED\]\]

While I'm sure it has its flaws (as any economic model -- I'm not to be
the judge of that), the advantage is that it's an [easy framework for
understanding]{.underline} and predicting [how]{.underline} CO2
[emissions will develop]{.underline} in the future. More so, it
[convincingly explains why]{.underline} simply [deploying **renewable
energy** and **new efficient tech**nology under the "**Green Growth**"
approach will **not prevent** us from **depleting** the carbon
budget]{.underline} for the 1.5 Celsius degree target.

For those who need a reminder: The IPCC estimates that we have about 7-8
years left until we have used up our entire global CO2 budget for the
1.5 target (emissions were \~59 Gt/year in 2019). That will project us
towards a global warming between 3-4 degrees (not going to explain why
that is crucial..). To have a fair chance at avoiding this hot-house
planet, the world must halve CO2 emissions by 2030, according to the
global scientific community. You can fact-check me here.

We can use the Kaya Identity and its variables to [analyze the
**feasibility** of reducing CO2]{.underline} emissions to this
magnitude. If our goal is to halve CO2 emissions (left side), in
mathematical terms, it automatically means we must also find a
combination of the four variables that halves their input (right side).
Let's check.

Global population (variable 1): Suggesting political measures to achieve
a 50% reduction of global population in only 7-8 years seems practically
difficult and, frankly, very controversial. If we trust demographic
projections, [we are still **decades away** from a shrinking
population]{.underline}, despite slowing birth rates in many regions.
According to the UN, global population is estimated to reach \~8.5 bn in
2030. That's approximately an additional +7% instead of a reduction of
50%.

Size of the economy (variable 2): Imagine any head of state promising to
[halve]{.underline} his/hers country's [GDP]{.underline} by 2030 -
[seems a bit like a **political suicide**,]{.underline} doesn't it?
Despite well-argued research of the faulty concept of GDP, the
[**systemic addiction** to and **dependency** on economic
growth]{.underline} even [makes this]{.underline} objective somewhat
[hard to avoid in the current capitalistic system]{.underline}. Still,
with a "moderate" global growth rate of 3%, the global economy will
DOUBLE in just \~25 years -- the very opposite direction of halving the
GDP by 2030.

Energy intensity of the economy (variable 3): A reduction of the energy
intensity of the economy -- so lowering the amount of energy used to
produce one unit of GDP -- can be achieved by deploying more efficient
technologies. In the last decades, we've seen a myriad of more efficient
cars, household appliances and IT-equipment introduced to the market.
Especially in countries transitioning into the service economy, this has
resulted in improved energy efficiency. [BUT]{.underline} on a [global
level]{.underline}, [we have [not seen]{.mark} an equivalent d[rop in
CO2-]{.mark}emissions]{.underline}. From a European perspective, this
mismatch can, on the one hand, be explained by the fact that [CO2
[emissions]{.mark} have simply **[shifted location]{.mark}** and balance
sheets]{.underline}, as [energy-intensive industry]{.underline} has
[**migrated** to other parts of the world]{.underline}. On the other
hand, it can [also be explained by]{.underline} what scientists call
"**[[Jevon's Paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}**". This can be summed up as
the [**rebound effect** for energy efficiency]{.underline}. [When [one
sector]{.mark} [gains]{.mark} in energy efficiency]{.underline} thanks
to improved technology, [[it]{.mark} immediately **[frees up
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} (either capital or energy). [As is the
**unwritten law** of capitalism]{.underline}, [free resources need to be
**invested** into **future growth**]{.underline}, which then
[**automatically** [leads to]{.mark} an **[increase of CO2]{.mark}
emissions** in a **different sector**]{.underline}. For households, a
decreased energy bill often leads to higher spending on other things
(bigger TV, longer holiday etc.). The result of this is that the new
consumption/production largely cancels out the original efficiency
savings -- and is the reason why only adding more efficient technology
will not help us reduce emissions by 50% by 2030.

\[\[FIGURE TWO OMITTED\]\]

Carbon intensity of energy (variable 4): Replacing fossil fuels with
renewable energy is probably the textbook measure for reducing CO2
emissions. It's the horse all governments are betting on. And to be
fair, on a technological level, we have managed this pretty well. Wind
and solar power are today cost-competitive with fossils in many areas
and the deployment rates worldwide are encouraging. The EU is even
aiming to meet 40-45% of its energy demand from renewable sources by
2030. So why are we not seeing decreasing rates of CO2, if renewables
are being deployed faster and more than ever? For the sake of
simplicity, I will highlight only two of the most compelling reasons
here:

Our [global [energy]{.mark} system [is]{.mark} still [**dominated** by
**fossil fuels**]{.mark} or non-renewables to **80%**]{.underline} (even
\~90% if we don't count in biomass which we really shouldn't be burning
for energy purposes). This is often more than we like to think --
especially with all the inflated advertisement on green energy projects
by fossil companies (the Greenwashing Files by ClientEarth is an
excellent example). With the exception of some countries / regions, it
seems [unlikely that the world could **cut in halve**]{.underline} its
fossil energy consumption [by 2030]{.underline}.

[The boom of renewable]{.underline} has [taken place **in addition** to
conventional **fossil energy** production]{.underline}. The [sum of this
is that the]{.underline} positive [effect of renewables]{.underline}
(having a much much lower CO2-footprint than fossils) **[never
materialises]{.underline}**, [as the growing]{.underline} and
energy-hungry [economy has **not allow** for coal and gas to **exit**
the system]{.underline} (in opposite, they have been growing, as the
chart below indicates).

\[\[FIGURE THREE OMITTED\]\]

To summarise: Despite progress on the two last variables, it's unlikely
that improvements in lowering energy and carbon intensity can compensate
for the increasing CO2-emissions from the growing population and economy
to reach an overall reduction effect of 50% for the entire Kaya
Identity.

This is the moment when you (if you've read the text and I've explained
it properly) should [start **questioning** whether simply renewables and
new technology can save us from a climate disaster]{.underline}. I did
it - and got angry and disappointed. It's also the place and time where
I criticize advocates of the "green growth" approach (in the EU we call
it the Green Deal) as the only panacea for solving the CO2-challenge and
for completely negleting the other part of the discussion.

Given the short time we have for radically changing the economy, green
growth will be neither transformative nor radical. It follows the old
pattern that says more will always be better and necessary. But as long
as we carry an energy portfolio consisting of 80% fossils, every
additional unit of GDP -- even money invested into renewables or energy
efficiency - will increase the CO2-burden through increased production
and consumption.

By following the [simple **mathematical terms** of the Kaya
Identity]{.underline}, it is [evident that we **[cannot]{.mark}** much
longer [afford]{.mark} an "ever-[growing econ]{.mark}omy"]{.underline}
[that **devours** more and more energy and materials]{.underline}. We
need to start taking out the bad stuff from the economy that is so
rapidly depleting resources - not just adding new ones. [Absolute
[decoupling]{.mark}]{.underline} of CO2 emissions from economic growth
is the conceptual lifeboat of green growth -- and unfortunately, [[has
**no empirical ev**]{.mark}**idence** that [it's
**possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**Financialization** occurs where]{.underline}, over time, [capitalist
economies]{.underline} undergo a [transformation]{.underline}, [with
profit-making via investment in production **declining**]{.underline},
to be [**replaced** by profit-making via investment in]{.underline}
financial **[markets]{.underline}**. In the present research, we offer a
novel theoretical explanation for this process, that we call the
credit-debt reproduction mechanism. [We derive this
**inductively**]{.underline}, starting with [Marx's analysis of the
**paradox** of monetary profit and its practical manifestation in the
capitalist economy]{.underline}, the [**[shortage of money]{.mark}** in
circulation]{.underline}. This shortage [results in capital becoming
**increasingly expensive**]{.underline}, [[making]{.mark} long-term
investment [decisions]{.mark} **less certain**]{.underline}, [**[less
profitable]{.mark}** and **less justifiable**]{.underline}. [Investment
in financial markets grows]{.underline}, but [this leads to an
**ever-expanding cycle** of **credit** and **debt**]{.underline}, which
[puts capitalist economies on a **one-way road** from productive
investments to predominantly **unproductive investments**]{.underline}.
We include in this analysis important reflections on the [distinction
between]{.underline} "[financialization]{.underline}" [and]{.underline}
"[financial development]{.underline}." We also [revive and
revisit]{.underline} the [notion of the **shortage of
money**]{.underline} as a key driver in this process. Another
contribution made in this research is to draw a distinction between
practical and theoretical solutions to the paradox of monetary profit.
Crucially, our research confirms the [**absence** of a **theoretical
solution**]{.underline} to the paradox, there existing only practical
solutions.

[Financialization is]{.underline} a multi-faceted and multi-layered
concept that is related to [the **inevitable** process of **profit
accumulation** in all monetary production economies]{.underline}. It can
be defined as "the [increasing role of]{.underline} [financial
motives]{.underline}, [financial markets]{.underline}, [financial actors
and financial institutions in]{.underline} the operation of the domestic
and international [economies]{.underline}" (Epstein Citation2005, 3).
Thus, over time, finance, the financial sector and financial activities
[occupy an **ever-growing share** of total economic
activity]{.underline}. This [leads to]{.underline} ever-[greater
profit-seeking]{.underline} through financial speculation, by both the
household and production sectors, [driven by a]{.underline} progressive
[rise in]{.underline} public and private **[debt]{.underline}** and the
ratio of total debt to GDP.

[[Financialization]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[[gives]{.underline}]{.mark} an ever-[greater **role** and [**power**
to]{.mark} credit and credit [issuers]{.mark}]{.underline} over time, as
any [profit-seeking activity leads to]{.underline} a permanent and
[growing **[shortage of money]{.mark}** in circulation]{.underline}. One
solution to deal with this shortage will be the injection of more
money/credit into circulation. In the absence of money with zero-debt
obligation (helicopter money), [[more **credit**]{.mark} **expansion**
will be [needed]{.mark}]{.underline}. But, [this [leads to]{.mark} more
**[debt]{.mark} accumulation** [and]{.mark} a further
**[shortage]{.mark} of money** in circulation]{.underline},
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in turn]{.underline}, [**[needs more
credit]{.mark}** for its redemption]{.underline}.

Reference to profit-seeking activities and the shortage of money in
circulation leads us to the paradox of monetary profit. This concept,
dating from the work of Karl Marx, refers to the impossibility of
monetizing profit as a direct result of the shortage of money. The
paradox exists in all profit-based monetary production economies, not
just capitalist systems. Keynes also provided historical evidence of the
shortage of money from the mercantilist era, under the term "scarcity of
money" (Keynes Citation1936, 212).

From this, we offer our first contribution to the literature, that
potential "solutions" to the paradox come in two forms---practical and
theoretical. A theoretical, and also sustainable, solution must be able
to prove that the same amount of money/credit, brought into and
circulating within the system, would be enough to monetize profit at the
end of the process (i.e., no extra injection of money/credit is needed),
regardless of whether the system is defined by classes or sectors.
Therefore, any extra money/credit that comes into circulation for the
realization of profit provides only a practical solution.

The solutions offered by Marx, and later by Circuitists and Post
Keynesians, are what we call practical solutions: extra money/credit
needs to be injected into circulation to monetize the profit. We argue,
moreover, that [there is **no theoretical solution** to the
paradox]{.underline} (contra some recent claims made, as elaborated on
below). In any profit-based monetary system, the [creation of credit
guarantees]{.underline} that the [demand for money]{.underline}/credit
[is **always above** the initial supply of credit]{.underline}. By
extending the demand for money/credit above supply, the importance and
the weight of money/credit increases continuously, in contrast to other
factors of production.

This dynamic is key to the present research. The definition of
financialization given at the outset links this concept to the shortage
of money in circulation and the practical way to satisfy this shortage.
More than this, however, [as]{.underline} the [weight given to
money]{.underline} and money-providers in investment [decisions
**grows**]{.underline}, two shifts occur. First, [**uncertainty rises**
over the profitability of productive project]{.underline}s,
[as]{.underline} the **[profitability]{.underline}** of the financial
[aspects of investment grow in **importance**]{.underline}; and second,
[this [drives]{.mark} a **[shift]{.mark}** in the center of
focus]{.underline}, [from productive [to **unproductive
investment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as the **primary** source of
profit-makin]{.underline}g.

From this, we derive our research question: How can we theorize the
nexus between the persistent shortage of money in circulation (as the
manifestation of the paradox of monetary profit) and the process of
financialization? We adopt an inductive approach in seeking an answer to
this question. We develop a narrative that investigates the
aforementioned concepts, analyzing each in turn and elaborating how they
relate to each other. A key element of this argument is to be found in
Marx's formalization of the paradox of monetary profit. Whilst the
paradox of monetary profit remains unresolved theoretically, in what
follows the paradox and the shortage of money in circulation provide the
conceptual "missing link" to the historical origins of financialization.

Our second contribution to the literature is thus to [theorize the
**process of financialization**]{.underline} and its links to the
paradox of monetary profit, [via]{.underline} a mechanism that we label
[the **credit-debt reproduction mechanism**]{.underline}: [credit
**reproduces** itself]{.underline}, but only [in the form of **new
debt**]{.underline}. [In the [absence of]{.mark}]{.underline} exogenous
[**[demand]{.mark}** for money/credit]{.underline}, the [credit-debt
reproduction mechanism [explains]{.mark}]{.underline} the core and
endogenous **[[shortage]{.mark} of money]{.underline}** in circulation
[in]{.underline} all monetary production economies (including
[capitalism]{.underline}). By [taking **external** elements]{.underline}
such as new technological advances, new investment projects, the rise of
population, etc., into account, [this shortage will be **exacerbated
exogenously**]{.underline}. This [extra demand]{.underline} for
money/credit is what [[leads to]{.mark} the rise of the **weight** and
importance of **credit**]{.underline} and credit providers in the
economy, [maintaining the **[vulnerability]{.mark}** of the **whole
economic system** to the financial sector and growing **unproductive
investments**]{.underline}. In undertaking this analysis, we also offer
a third contribution. Keynes (Citation1936), in Chapter 23, refers to
the scarcity of money, in analyzing Mercantilist's monetary affairs. In
the present research, we are reviving interest in this concept, now
referred to as the shortage of money in circulation, as a key element in
our theorizing of modern-day financialization.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

In the rest of the paper, we next reflect on the different
understandings that heterodox and mainstream schools of economic thought
have for, respectively, "financialization" and "financial development."
We then analyze financialization in greater detail, exploring the
differences within heterodox economics as to whether it can be
considered a relatively new phenomenon, starting with financial
liberalization and deregulation in the 1980s, or whether its roots go
further back, to earlier conceptions of the monetary production economy
(Sawyer Citation2013). From this, we analyze the paradox of monetary
profit and its manifestation, the shortage of money in circulation. This
enables us to draw together these concepts with financialization to
provide a new theorization of the process of financialization, based on
the paradox of monetary profit: the credit-debt reproduction mechanism.
This, we posit, is the process in which credit reproduces itself on a
diminishing scale and creates a situation through which demand for
credit will be continuously above supply, increasing the role and power
of credit issuers in the economy. We also show how this process, present
in all capitalist economies, can nonetheless vary in the speed at which
it spreads through the economy. Thus, by theorizing the process of
financialization, we also demonstrate that the paradox of monetary
profit, whilst having a "practical" solution, does not have a
"theoretical" solution. We conclude with reflections on our findings and
what this means for research on financialization in monetary production
economies in the 21st century. Financialization or financial
development? As noted above, we develop our analysis inductively,
building up a narrative that leads us to our theoretical contributions
below. This requires us to revisit concepts that, in and of themselves
may well be familiar, but which need at least a brief restatement as
part of the theory-building process. In this section, we draw a
distinction between the concepts of financial development and
financialization. In so doing, we draw a distinction between
"mainstream"Footnote1 and "heterodox" economic views. This distinction,
elaborated on below, manifests as viewing the roles of money as,
respectively, passive/neutral or active. Financialization, with its
active role for money, is thus linked directly to the work of heterodox
scholars. Most notably, Magdoff and Sweezy (Citation1987) attempt to
theorize the state of stagnation in mature capitalist economies using
Marx's narrative of the evolution of capitalism. They emphasize the need
to return to Marx's focus on capital accumulation to be able "to examine
the roots of the stagnation-financialization contradiction" (Magdoff and
Foster Citation2014, 3). That said heterodox economists have, in turn,
split broadly into two camps around the understanding of the origins of
financialization (Sawyer Citation2013). The reemergence of a focus on
the origins of financialization lying in deeper economic history can be
seen as a reaction to those heterodox scholars who see financialization
instead as a more recent phenomenon, arising out of the deregulatory
neoliberalism starting in the mid-late 1970s. In what follows, we argue
that financialization needs to be seen in its deeper historical context.
We also highlight the general omission in those debates of a theoretical
mechanism that can explain the shift in capitalist economies, from a
(productive) monetary production economy to an (unproductive) economy
based on investment in financial "speculation." It is this that we label
the "credit-debt reproduction mechanism." We begin with three key
factors that define mainstream/orthodox views on the role of money and
financial institutions in the economy, contrasting each with heterodox
perspectives. First, is the neutrality of money (see Wray Citation2012,
4). Two key elements can be identified: First, money and money issuers,
(specifically private banks that create credit) are not seen as part of
the real economy. They represent neutral links between real commodities
or real assets. Second, money and credit are not different from one
another but have the same functionality as a medium of exchange. An
increase in money or credit in circulation has a nominal impact, but not
a real impact, on economic variables. Heterodox scholars, by contrast,
believe in the endogenous theory of money, in which money exists as a
debt to finance production; and its supply is demand-led. Therefore, it
does have an impact on real variables such as investment, production,
and employment (see Kaldor Citation1982; Kregel Citation1998; Lavoie
Citation2022; Minsky Citation1986). In the dichotomic orthodox account,
it is almost forgotten that money (created by central banks) does not
create debt, while credit does, with its ensuing financial obligations.
Second, is the passive role of financial institutions. Reflecting the
neutrality of money, financial institutions have a passive intermediary
role in connecting savers to investors, nationally or internationally
(see Levine Citation2005). Credit can be created through loanable funds,
which are constrained by and derived from the volume of savers'
deposits; and can be expanded through the fractional reserve mechanism.
Therefore, the volume of credit a bank can lend depends on the volume of
deposits it receives from its customers. In this respect, there is again
no reason to believe that credit is different from money; the supply of
money is thus exogenous. Heterodox scholars, by contrast, believe that
the causal direction is the reverse: bank lending leads to the formation
of bank deposits, thus such lending has an active role in the economy
(see McLeay, Radia, and Thomas Citation2014). Moreover, the orthodox
view that savers' deposits develop loanable funds in the economy is
disputed, not only by scholars from multiple schools of thought (see,
among others, Fontana Citation2007; Werner Citation2005, Citation2014a,
Citation2014b) but also by the monetary authorities (ECB Citation2011;
Jakab and Kumhof Citation2015; McLeay, Radia, and Thomas Citation2014).
Third, there is the question of market efficiency in the allocation of
resources. According to the efficient market hypothesis, agents are
rational and make their decisions based on the information (public or
private) available to them (Fama Citation1991; Malkiel Citation2003).
This theory dismisses any long-term abnormality or disproportionality in
terms of profit, size, and resource allocation in financial markets.
Abnormalities simply cannot last long in the presence of speculators and
arbitrageurs, because their activities bring any abnormality into
equilibrium by reallocating resources. Thus speculation has been
described as a stabilizing factor in such markets (Friedman
Citation1953, 175). Mispriced assets (real or financial) will revert to
their normal price, and the possibility of having bubbles in the market
is zero. From this, any permanent increase in the size of the financial
sector is attributable to the proportionate development of the real
sector. Therefore, the size of the financial sector depends on demand
from the real sector for financial services. Heterodox scholars, even
those who would not attach themselves to the heterodox school, challenge
the idea of market efficiency and the rationality of agents. This can be
based on dynamic instability of financial markets (Keen Citation1995),
the role of institutions in shaping the allocation of resources (North
Citation1991), or the failure of markets given the presence of imperfect
information (Stiglitz Citation2000). The three factors above,
individually and jointly, demonstrate the difference between passive and
active views of money, seen in the terms "financial development" and
"financialization," respectively. This, in turn, results in opposite
perspectives on whether or not the process so described makes a positive
or negative contribution to economic activity and growth (King and
Levine Citation1993; Rajan and Zingales Citation1996). Having thus
established in our theory-building the importance of financialization as
an active driver of economic activity, indeed of economic structure, we
now reflect briefly on the two distinct heterodox views of
financialization. Heterodox approaches to financialization The notion of
financialization has emerged from heterodox writings, in an effort to
understand stagnation in capitalist economies. Over time, two distinct
understandings of the origins of financialization have become clear in
this literature. We reflect on these now. Financialization as a new
phase of capitalism

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

This view sees the [**origins** of financialization in **neoliberal
policies**]{.underline} that drove deregulation, both within and between
capitalist economies, from the late 1970s to early 1980s, onwards.
Epstein (Citation2005, 3) identifies financialization, neoliberalism and
globalization as the defining characteristics of a new era of
capitalism. These have been seen as being [driven by the pressure of
**competition** and the need to maintain **profitability**,]{.underline}
[with **financialization** representing]{.underline} the "[**systemic
transformation** of mature capitalist economies]{.underline}"
(Lapavitsas Citation2013, 793).

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

Financialization has seen a shift of power amongst non-financial agents,
from labor to capital and from company to shareholders. This has been
explained as the result of a "finance-dominated regime of accumulation"
characterized by an increase in the profits of the financial sector and
the "sluggish growth" of investment in the real sector, along with a
"polarization of income distribution" that makes the economic system
susceptible to financial bubbles, and eventually financial crisis
(Stockhammer Citation2012, 48). Making a profit through traditional
channels becomes more challenging and, in some cases, riskier compared
to some financial activities (Lapavitsas Citation2013). Those scholars
who hold this view of the origins of financialization also see the
possibility of reversing this process. With financialization arising out
of neoliberal deregulation, they believe de-financialization can be
achieved through tighter regulations, the separation of investment
banking from commercial banking (Sweeney Citation2019), "democratic
pressure," "the resistance of financialised citizens" and an increase in
the role of state and syndicates in the economy (Karwowski Citation2019,
1020). Reorientation of the finance industry, and prohibition of risky
speculative activities, will return financial institutions to their
essential functionalities (Lawrence Citation2014; Ülgen Citation2017) by
"re-establishing the command of the social and collective over the
private and individual for the modern era" (Lapavitsas Citation2013,
792). Within this perspective, there are disagreements over the exact
start of the financialization process, ranging from the 1970s to the
early-1980s with different studies focusing on different aspects of
financialization (inter alia Christopherson, Martin, and Pollard
Citation2013; Greenwood and Scharfstein Citation2013; Hein Citation2012;
Krippner Citation2005; Orhangazi Citation2008; Palley Citation2013; Van
Treeck Citation2012). That said, they agree that this broadly-defined
period covers the origins of financialization. Financialization as a
process emerging from the birth of the monetary production economy This
second view sees financialization as a process that began on a
macro-scale with the birth of the monetary production economy. Some
scholars therefore use the term "historical capitalism" to distinguish
it from later epochs of capitalism (see Arrighi Citation1994; Braudel
Citation1981, Citation1984). This view sees the neoliberal deregulatory
policies in the 1970s--1980s as facilitating a more rapid expansion of
financialization, but which itself "has deeper roots that are unrelated
to neoliberalism" (Kotz Citation2008, 1). We first outline the key
features of the monetary production economy, before establishing its
links to financialization. In so doing, we also show how this
understanding of financialization differs, by definition, from the
mainstream understanding of "financial development" presented above. The
term "monetary production economy," or simply "monetary economy," as
Keynes (Citation1933)Footnote2 called it, refers to an economic system
in which money is not "a neutral link between transactions in real
things and real assets," a view consistent with heterodox understandings
of money that underpin financialization. In such an economy, production
starts with an initial amount of money, in the expectation of getting
more money at the end of the production period. Using Marx's circuit of
money capital, the monetary production economy can be represented as
M-C-M′. In this economy, monetary profit (ΔM = M′-M) is the objective of
production. This stands in contrast to the "real exchange economy" in
which money works as a medium of exchange between two different
commodities (C-M-C′), or does not "enter into motives or decisions"
(Keynes Citation1933) at all (such as the barter economy, C-C′),
consistent with the orthodox view of money that underpins the notion of
(passive) financial development. One of the pioneering scholars to
examine the underlying capital accumulation process in its historical
context is Arrighi (Citation1994), who introduced the concept of
"systemic cycles of accumulation" for an economic system based on Marx's
theory of the circuit of money capital (M-C-M′). His unique
interpretation differs significantly from Marx's initial account, but
supports the second perspective above on the origins of
financialization. The development of capitalism since the 1970s should
be seen "in the light of patterns of recurrence and evolution, which
span the entire lifetime of historical capitalism as a world system.
Once we stretch the space-time horizon of our observations and
theoretical conjectures in this way, tendencies that seemed novel and
unpredictable begin to look familiar" (Arrighi Citation1994,
4).Footnote3 Arrighi splits the M-C-M\' circuit into two phases, each
covering a specific extended period. The initial phase (M-C), represents
a period of "material expansion" (Arrighi Citation1994, 2), with a
specific regime of accumulation, distinguished by "investment in fixed
capital that creates the potential for regular increases in productivity
and mass consumption. For this potential to be realized, adequate
governmental policies and actions, social institutions, norms, and
habits of behavior (the 'mode of regulation') were required" (Arrighi
Citation1994, 2). This is the phase in which capitalism can be
identified by its specialization in mass-scale production, investment,
and trade as the main source of profit accumulation. This productivity
and profitability will eventually be weakened through "market saturation
and capitalist competition" (W. I. Robinson Citation2011, 273). This
leads to the second phase (C-M\'), the period of the "rebirth of
financial capital" and its expansion, in which "the locus of
accumulation shifts to finance capital; haute finance comes to dominate
the hegemonic power by manipulating financial services to sustain
profit-making" (W. I. Robinson Citation2011, 273). To understand why
this shift happens, we need to look at the ethical foundation of
capitalism in which capitalists do not remain under any restriction and
are under no obligation to follow any specific specialization when it
comes to profitability. They are free to invest in any profitable
project; and it does not need to be in line with national or
international priorities (Braudel Citation1982). Hudson (Citation2015,
133--134) provides examples of such behaviors, even at the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution, when financiers refused to finance the
railway industry in Britain for a long time until they obtained monopoly
ownership rights that legalized the maintenance of their "rent-seeking
privileges." This "eclecticism," Braudel (Citation1984, 246) argues,
happens in all capitalist economies through financial expansion, with
investment moving away from production and commerce to find more
profitable opportunities in financial activities. Braudel (Citation1984,
242--246) provides examples of "commission trade" and "acceptance
trade," either for buying or selling, that was practiced in Holland,
Italy, Germany, and France, and which were all based on credit expansion
"4, 5, 10 or 15 times the specie in circulation." Braudel gives many
examples of merchants from various countries who abandoned their
commercial activities to gain profit from speculation and renting money;
and explains how the economic power of a nation rises with production
and commerce and then declines through the expansion of
financialization, which is the "sign of autumn" (Braudel Citation1984,
246). Phillips (Citation2006) identifies the same pattern, in Spain, the
Netherlands and Great Britain in the 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, when
these leading economic powers of their time displayed their superiority
through production and trade, but then experienced a deterioration in
power when their financial sectors started to direct monetary capital
toward rent-seeking and speculation activities. Thus financialization is
a "sign of late-stage debilitation, marked by excessive debt, great
disparity between rich and poor, and unfolding economic decline"
(Phillips Citation2006, 268). In a similar vein, Keynes (Citation1930,
149) claims that the rise of civilizations and their wealth comes
through enterprises and their ability to make a profit through their
investment projects, which in turn depends on the availability of money
and "the behavior of the banking and monetary system." In his historical
analysis of Spain, France, and England, he states that the accumulation
of wealth in these countries happened when more precious metals were in
circulation and "profit inflation" was higher than "wage inflation."
This was the situation in Spain from 1520 to 1590, in France from 1530
to 1700 and in England from 1550 to 1650. According to Keynes
(Citation1930, 158--159) "In these golden years, modern capitalism was
born," but with a specific characteristic that has not left us through
the intervening centuries, namely, the shortage of money in circulation,
whether it is commodity money (gold/silver), currency (backed by a fixed
portion of gold/silver) or fiat currency (backed by nothing). The
history of capitalism in the second approach is, therefore, the story of
the rise and fall of developed economies, in which prosperity starts
with production and trade, but ends up with financial activities that do
not produce any wealth, but rather create bubbles through speculation on
existing assets. This is the situation that Keynes (Citation1936, 103)
and Strange (Citation1986, 1) called, respectively, "casino capitalism,"
in which the "financial system is rapidly coming to resemble nothing as
much as a vast casino." One challenge with this second heterodox
understanding of financialization is the level of generalization in its
analysis of capitalism as a whole. This downplays the importance of
institutions and the cultural aspects of individual nations regarding
the evolution of capitalism and the speed of the financialization
process. Capitalism has diverse manifestations across nations (Hall and
Soskice Citation2001). Ultimately, however, financialization pushes all
toward the same destiny, although the speed of the financialization
process varies across countries. Crucially for what follows, as
compelling as the second heterodox understanding of financialization is,
compared with the "modern" perspective, it does not show the exact
transformation mechanism by which a productive capitalist system changes
into a financialized system. There is almost no analytical discussion of
how financial sectors in mature capitalist economies grow stronger and
become able to accumulate more capital than other sectors. The principal
contribution of this paper is to propose a theoretical solution to this
missing analytical link. We argue that it can be explained by reference
to the paradox of monetary profit and its empirical manifestation, the
shortage of money in circulation. This analysis also underpins the
conclusion that the paradox of monetary profit itself does not have a
theoretical solution. It is then the speed at which the shortage of
money comes about that determines the speed of financialization in
different capitalist economies.

[The **paradox** of **monetary profit**]{.underline}

[Central to understanding capitalism and its **transformation** from a
competitive]{.underline} and productive [system to a financialized
**unproductive monopoly** system]{.underline}, is an analysis of its
[source of **monetary profit**]{.underline}. Marx (Citation1885, 201)
reports that one of the opponents of the economist Thomas Tooke
(1774--1858) once asked Tooke a question about the source of money for
the realization of profit, using the circuit of money capital (M-C-M′),
but "neither Tooke nor anyone else has answered it so far." Thus the
[paradox]{.underline} of monetary profit [and the circuit of money
capital]{.underline} (M-C-M′) were [known before Marx]{.underline}, but
it was he who first disseminated it in his theory of surplus value in
the earliest German publication of Das Kapital in 1885.

The paradox refers to the [**impossibility** of the **realization** of
**monetary profit** in the capitalist economy]{.underline}, to which we
would add: from a theoretical point of view. Even mainstream scholars
acknowledge the existence of this puzzle. Mankiw (Citation2016, 57)
shows that in neoclassical income distribution theory, economic [profit
should be **zero** because the total value of production should be
**equal** to the total value of distributed income]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, he [tries to justify]{.underline} the existence of profit
[by separating]{.underline} "[accounting profit]{.underline}"
[from]{.underline} "[economic profit]{.underline}." This is consistent
with a traditional view of capitalism where the owner, producer,
investor and beneficiary are one and the same, but [this view
**overlooks** the role of **credit** and **financial institutions** in
the creation of **debt**]{.underline}.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

In a model of a political economy in which total income is divided
between two main classes, capitalists and workers, Marx (Citation1885,
204) explains the paradox as follows: The capitalist class remains
consequently the sole point of departure of the circulation of money...
The capitalist class as a whole cannot draw out of circulation what was
not previously thrown into it. Thus, if the total wage in the whole
system paid to the workers is W, it would be impossible for the
capitalists (as a class) to make a total revenue (TR) higher than W, so
the difference, TR-W, is the shortage of money in circulation (Figure
1). \[\[FIGURE ONE OMITTED\]\] In the best possible scenario for the
realization of profit, workers can spend all of their wages on the goods
they have produced in the whole system (C = W). Empirically, this means
that the capitalists as a class cannot make any profit unless the
shortage of money for the realization of profit is somehow financed.
Thus, the paradox of monetary profit manifests itself in the form of a
shortage of money in circulation. Figure 2 adapts and extends this
simple model. First, it replaces Marx's classes with economic sectors.
Second, it incorporates a third sector, to show the flow of financial
transactions between the household, production and financial sectors.
Crucially, however, the same issue of monetization of profit remains for
the banks' profit and households' return on their deposits. Following
Graziani (Citation2003), in a pure credit economy with no government,
when banks lend an initial amount of money to the production sector
(shown by B in Figure 2), given a fixed supply of money in circulation,
no sector is able to monetize their excess return or profit without the
creation and injection of extra money into circulation by banks. This is
because banks do not just transmit liquidities between agents but they
create more liquidities needed for the realization of profit or excess
return. In this model, the excess returns or profits for the financial
and household sectors, that cannot be monetized with the initial amount
of money in circulation (i.e. B), are B \* r and D \* i, respectively.
\[\[FIGURE TWO OMITTED\]\] Bruun and Heyn-Johnsen (Citation2009) believe
that neither Marx, as the disseminator of the paradox, nor Keynes who
dealt with aggregate income determination in his General Theory, solved
this paradox. Smithin (Citation2016) has also claimed that the puzzle
remained unanswered by Marx, but this claim is only partially correct.
In Volume 2 of Capital, Marx presented what we are calling a practical,
but not a theoretical, solution based on the idea that the capitalist
will be the final owner of the surplus value by putting his own money
into circulation for his consumption. Given this distinction, a
theoretical solution is equivalent to an endogenous and self-sustained
solution in an interval of one period (or circuit). A practical solution
would be considered either to be an exogenous and temporary solution; or
to be any solution based on a multi-period dynamic model (according to
Post Keynesian Stock-Flow-Consistent models, or some Circuitists'
multi-period dynamic analyses). This is also unsustainable given the
permanent need for extra money/credit injections. As soon as these
injections cease, the system collapses. A multi-period analysis brings
in money/credit from other periods for the realization of profit. This
is the meaning of a practical solution that transmits or circulates debt
from one period (circuit) to another.Footnote4 Logically, however, it
does not and cannot be seen as a theoretical solution to the paradox.
QED. Marx's practical solution for the paradox of monetary profit In
Volume 2 of Capital, Marx explains the paradox simply by saying: "How
can they \[capitalists\] continually draw £600 out of circulation, when
they continually throw only £500 into it?" (Marx Citation1885, 204).
According to Marx, "surplus value" (profit), as a value embedded in
commodities,Footnote5 will be realized when capitalists put fresh/new
money into circulation for their consumption. The source of this money
could be either their own money or bank credit (Marx Citation1885, 195,
256). This does not mean that the capitalist pays for his/her own
produced goods. It does not make sense to buy from yourself to make a
profit. To understand the meaning of purchasing for consumption,
consider two capitalists, A (who produces consumer goods) and B (who
produces capital goods). By bringing their fresh money into circulation,
they buy the products of each other and both capitalists can monetize
their profits. This idea was summed up by Robinson as: "\[T\]he workers
spend what they get; the capitalists get what they spend" (quoted by
Asimakopulos Citation1989, 269). Although innovative, there are three
issues with this solution. First, in a monetary production economy, the
capitalist's objective of production is monetary profit and not, as Marx
calls it "the surplus value incorporated in the commodities,"Footnote6
which may not be monetized in the market. Money in such a system has
value beyond being a medium of exchange. Marx's solution is in contrast
to M-C-M′, as it represents an important characteristic of a monetary
production economy in which "production begins with money on the
expectation of ending with more money later" (Wray Citation1999, 1). So,
for capitalists, the realization of monetary profit is more important
than purchasing for individual consumption, even where this individual
consumption is in the form of consumption of capital goods, i.e.,
investment. This is the line that differentiates capitalists from
entrepreneurs and it seems that Marx, with his focus on class, does not
consider this when he analyses the paradox of profit (see Taymans
Citation1951). The first group are looking for profit, either in
production or speculation. The source of profit for capitalists is not
important as they have no specific interest (production or
non-production, national or international). This is why Braudel
(Citation1984, 246) uses the term "eclecticism" to explain the mindset
of capitalists over the centuries. In contrast, entrepreneurs have a
different mindset about their objectives when it comes to production.
Maximization of profit, regardless of source, is not necessarily the
main purpose of their investments. The second issue in Marx's writings
on what we call a "practical solution" to the paradox concerns the
notion of "individual consumption." In Marx's writing this is ambiguous,
because in the context of a model with different sectors (household,
production, etc.), rather than sociopolitical groups (capitalists,
workers) as Marx framed it, capitalist consumption is already considered
in household consumption. Third, Marx's solution is valid if the
capitalist is both a producer and a financier. This means the capitalist
must be an entrepreneur who focuses on maintaining the business beyond
profit maximization. In a credit-led economy where the producer and
financier belong to separate sectors, however, applying Marx's practical
solution to the paradox means that the producer (or capitalist producer,
as Marx has in his mind) must accept a debt-profit cycle in which they
must borrow more and accept another debt obligation to extract the
initial profit. This can be justifiable if all producers increase their
time horizon and chase the profit of the first period, by keeping their
optimism and incentives and carrying on their investment for the second
period of production. This was reiterated by Kalecki's (Citation1935,
297) view that "capitalists ... determine ... their profits by their
consumption and their investments," but this profit-chasing process will
not be sustainable for the whole productive capitalist class. Despite
these three reservations, Marx introduced a novel practical solution,
one that has been disregarded in the analysis even by some circuitists
and post Keynesian scholars who have claimed to find a solution for the
paradox (see Keen Citation2010, Citation2011; Messori and Zazzaro
Citation2005; Nell Citation2002; Parguez Citation2004; Renaud
Citation2000; Rochon Citation2005; Zezza Citation2012). That said---and
significantly in the present context---such studies do not distinguish
between different types of solution: practical versus theoretical.
Ultimately, the paradox does not have a theoretical solution over a
circuit period and an extra source of money/credit is needed to deliver
a practical solution. From Marx's point of view, the source of the money
needed for the realization of profit cannot be generated endogenously
from what was initially put into circulation, but comes exogenously from
the capitalists' own pockets or bank credit. This is important
specifically when we are dealing with a pure credit economy, where the
source of money in circulation is credit issued by the financial sector.
According to Seccareccia (Citation1988, 51, quoted in Rochon
Citation2005, 128), even "production is a process of debt creation."
Therefore, the source of monetary profit for all profit-seeking sectors
must be fresh/new money or credit that is brought exogenously into
circulation by financiers, without which the shortage of money would be
exposed. This shortage cannot be seen easily in the real world because
credit expansion, budget deficit spending, and/or trade surpluses
provide short-term practical solutions (by injecting extra money/credit)
that cover the shortage temporarily, but this credit expansion covers it
at the price of creating more debt and, eventually, a further shortage
of money in the future. It is not so much the process that is visible in
the real world, but its debt-laden consequences.

Financialization and the paradox of monetary profit

Through the foregoing narrative, we [now have a **theoretical
framework**]{.underline} to connect Keynes's historical observations on
the scarcity of money and Marx's view on the paradox of monetary profit,
which manifests a shortage of money in circulation. This [leads us to
the role of **banks**]{.underline} as the traditional financial
institutions in [a simultaneous and sequential creation of **credit**
and **debt**]{.underline}. This is the system that we call the
credit-debt reproduction mechanism, which has two functions: [creating
**credit** and the **associated debt**]{.underline} which is bigger than
the initial amount of credit (varying with the level of interest rates);
and making a continuous demand for more credit endogenously (given the
shortage of money in circulation) to repay the interest.

These two mechanisms [work together with **synergistic
power**]{.underline}: [credit **expansion**]{.underline} by the lender
[conceals the **shortage of money** in circulation
provisionally]{.underline}, [at the cost of **[rising debt]{.mark}** for
non-financial sectors in the future]{.underline}. The [accumulation of
debt]{.underline} in the household and production sectors, in turn,
[[creates]{.mark} a **new [demand]{.mark}** for money/credit just to
**pay** for the profit of the lenders]{.underline}. So, we argue that
money cannot be fully destroyed because the principal is paid, but not
the interest. [In a purely credit-led monetary production
system]{.underline}, where there is no government to supply "helicopter
money" (money with zero-debt obligation), [**another line** of
[credit]{.mark} is **needed** to [pay]{.mark} the
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The demand for **extra
credit**]{.underline} to repay the interest will [continue in a
**diminishing** manner]{.underline}. Under such a system, [credit
**re[produces]{.mark} itself**]{.underline} endogenously [through the
creation of]{.underline} new but smaller
**[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

To show this mathematically, consider a purely credit-led economic
system. If the average interest rate is r% and it remains constant for
unlimited periods, the long-term multiplier for the shortage of money
(that leads to extra demand for credit) to repay just the interest
(i.e., the profit of the banking system) will be r/(1 − r). This means
for the initial credit, say K, the initial shortage to repay just the
interest is K×r and, by borrowing this amount, we need an extra K×r2 for
the next period just to repay the interest. If this process of borrowing
goes on for unlimited periods, the total amount of the shortage (or
extra credit required) to pay just the interest on the initial credit K,
will be:

\[\[EQUATION ONE OMITTED\]\]

[This amount will **go up [exponentially]{.mark}** if r goes
up]{.underline}. As r approaches one, [[demand]{.mark} for extra credit
[will be **unlimited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the whirl
of]{.underline} the [credit-debt reproduction mechanism creates **extra
demand** for money/credit that is **always above supply**]{.underline},
[even in the **absence** of any **exogenous shock**]{.underline}. This
increases the weight of money/credit and the money/credit issuer in all
investment decisions. But this extra demand for money/credit is not
limited to paying interest. [Given]{.underline} the [intense competition
to keep]{.underline} or extend profitability in the capitalist system,
[economic [agents]{.mark} **cannot survive**]{.underline} if remaining
idle without new investment or a new technological innovation. Sooner or
later, [they must either **[leave the market]{.mark}** or
accept]{.underline} more competition, more investment and/or **[more
debt]{.underline}**.

It [thus follows that **[all sectors]{.mark}** in the monetary
production economy will eventually **[rely on
credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [provided]{.underline} either [by
the]{.underline} traditional banking system or by the [**shadow
banking** system]{.underline}. The latter includes such operators as
various funds that are less regulated by the monetary authorities. A
good example is the construction companies that must borrow to build
houses; whilst, on the demand side, households must also borrow to buy
those houses.Footnote7 The entire system gradually and permanently
relies on the services provided by the ever-growing importance of
creditors. They become "too big to fail."Footnote8

[The **accumulation of [debt]{.mark}** for **non-financial**
sectors]{.underline}, on the one hand, [[leads to]{.mark} the
[**decline** of]{.mark} **efficient [demand]{.mark}** [and
**investment**]{.mark} in the real side of the economy]{.underline}. On
the other hand, this [**[increases]{.mark}** the size and power of
financial institutions]{.underline} as they are the only driving force
of the system, [**expanding [the debt cycle]{.mark}** from one period to
the next]{.underline}. This will continue [[until]{.mark} one part of
the system **cannot participate**]{.underline} in this debt cycling any
more. This is a pattern [seen in]{.underline} almost [all **economic**
and **[financial crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Marx's [law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall]{.underline}
(**[LTRPF]{.underline}**) [argues that]{.underline}, [over
time]{.underline}, [the [**profitability** of]{.mark} [cap]{.mark}ital
employed [will **fall**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Marx reckoned this was
"[the **most important law** of political economy]{.underline}" because
it [posed an **irreconcilable contradiction** in the capitalist mode of
production]{.underline} between the production of things and services
that human society needs and profit for capital -- [and it would
[generate]{.mark}]{.underline} regular and recurring [[**crises** in
**investment**]{.mark} and **production**]{.underline}.

Marx's law has been attacked theoretically as erroneous, illogical and
indeterminate and it has been rejected as empirically disproven.
However, [various]{.underline} Marxist [[economists]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[provided]{.mark} a **robust defence** of the law's
logic]{.underline}. (Carchedi and Roberts, Kliman, Murray Smith.) And
the [body of **[empirical ev]{.mark}idence**]{.underline}
[supporting]{.underline} a long-term falling rate of profit on capital
accumulated [has **mounted** over the years]{.underline}.

Now Tomas [Rotta from Goldsmith University]{.underline} of London [and
Rishabh Kumar from the University of Massachusetts]{.underline} have
made another important contribution to the empirical evidence supporting
Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. In their
paper, Was Marx right? [Development and exploitation in]{.underline} [43
countries]{.underline}, 2000--2014, [R&K find that **Marx's law is
right**]{.underline}: [capital intensity **rises faster** than the rate
of **exploitation** and so the **global profit rate
declines**]{.underline}.

They generate a [new panel **dataset** of]{.underline} the
[key]{.underline} Marxist [variables]{.underline} from 2000 to 2014
[[using]{.underline}]{.mark} the World Input Output Database
(**[WIOD]{.underline}**) [covering 56 industries across 43
countries]{.underline} in the 2000-2014 period. "To the best of our
knowledge, ours is [the **first ever attempt** at producing a
**[comprehensive]{.mark}** global [data]{.mark}set of Marxist
variables]{.underline}."

R&K find that the [average [profit rate **declined**]{.mark} at the
**world level**]{.underline} from 2000 to 2014. They add that the
[**rate of profit** on total capital **declined** as per-capita GDP for
a country]{.underline} rose owing to the greater share of unproductive
capital in rich countries. Given that [**unproductive** activities
increase with economic development]{.underline}, "our [finding
adds]{.underline} a [second mechanism to Marx's]{.underline} original
[prediction about]{.underline} the [falling rate of
profit]{.underline}."

The [**big advantage** of]{.underline} the R&K's [[study]{.mark} is that
it can [produce]{.mark} a **rate of profit** [based on]{.mark} the
**[productive]{.mark}** [sectors]{.mark} of economies]{.underline}. In
Marxist theory, it is [**only** these sectors that generate new
value]{.underline} from capital investment and not just redistribute
value already created. [So]{.underline} it is [the **rate of profit** in
these **productive** sectors]{.underline} that best [[indicates]{.mark}
the]{.underline} health and [**[direction]{.mark}** of the capitalist
economy]{.underline}; as the [rate of profit in]{.underline} the
**[[non-productive]{.underline}]{.mark}** (financial, retail, commercial
and property) sectors [**ultimately [depends on]{.mark}** the rate of
profit in the **value-creating** [productive
sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}.

R&K point out that [previous estimates]{.underline} of the rate of
profit at a global level [could **not** make this
**distinction**]{.underline} (Basu et al. (2022)
https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2020/07/25/a-world-rate-of-profit-a-new-approach/
). But [using **industry-level data**]{.underline} from the
Socio-Economic Accounts (SEA) of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD)
and country-level data from the Extended Penn World Tables (EPWT), R&K
[**recalculate** the value added]{.underline} of every industry using
the decomposition between productive and unproductive activity.

They find that the [global [rate of profit]{.mark}]{.underline} on both
total and private capital [[reached a **peak**]{.underline}]{.mark} at
13.7% just prior to the 2008 financial crisis, [[then
**plummeted**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and continued a]{.underline} gradual
**[decline]{.underline}** to 12.7% in 2014 (graph top left). This was
accompanied by a rise in the organic composition of capital (the ratio
of fixed assets and raw materials to wages of labour) -- graph bottom
left, which rose faster than the rate of surplus value (profits over
wages) -- graph top right -- [all **in accordance** with Marx's law of
profitability]{.underline}. And this [overall fall was driven by a
**fall** in the **rate of profit** in **productive**
sectors]{.underline} (graph bottom right).

The [**trajectory** of the]{.underline} global [capitalist economy
reveals]{.underline} a deep and persistent **[malaise]{.underline}**.
Since the Great Recession of 2008-2009, G7 [economies]{.underline} have
[failed to regain]{.underline} their former **[dynamism]{.underline}**.
The acute yet temporary recession triggered by the global pandemic has
only exacerbated this long-term trend. Across the G7, metrics for
business investment, output, living standards, and labour productivity
show **[[stagnation]{.underline}]{.mark}** or negligible growth,
[[falling]{.mark} well **[below]{.mark}**]{.underline} the pre-**[[2008
trajectory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The current [epoch of
capitalist]{.underline} [development marks a departure from]{.underline}
the traditional [cyclical crises of the past]{.underline}. Unlike the
classical U-shaped or W-shaped recessions of earlier eras, the
post-crisis recovery now consistently fails to restore prior growth
trends. [Economic **[contractions]{.mark}**]{.underline} of 1-2% [no
longer give way to]{.underline} pre-crisis [growth]{.underline} rates
[but instead [usher in]{.mark} **prolonged
[stagnation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This [dynamic]{.underline} has [defined]{.underline} the [**aftermath**
of]{.underline} both the [2008 financial crisis]{.underline} and the
pandemic-induced slump of 2020, particularly in the EU, Eurozone, and
Japan. The United States, while outperforming its G7 peers, is barely
achieving growth at 2%, while the rest hover around 1% or stagnate
entirely, as in the cases of Japan and Canada. [Worker productivity
continues]{.underline} its long-term **[decline]{.underline}**,
[reinforcing]{.underline} the broader [malaise]{.underline}. The 2020s
thus stand as one of [the **weakest periods** for]{.underline} global
[capitalist expansion]{.underline} since the early 1980s.

Ireland's performance, when stripped of distortions from imported
intellectual property and aircraft leasing, reveals a tepid reality.
Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) measures show stagnation in per capita
terms since 2007. The North's trajectory, meanwhile, aligns with the
broader stagnation evident in other advanced economies.

[Compounding this]{.underline} stagnation [is]{.underline} the
[**[waning]{.mark}** of [innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**otal **[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**actor
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roductivity, a measure of efficiency in
combining labour and capital, [[indicates **declining
dynamism**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the heartlands of capitalism. Without
significant breakthroughs in productivity, there is [**little impetus**
for increased business investment]{.underline}. Across the G7, fixed
investment as a share of GDP remains flat, oscillating between 10% and
15%.

For Marxist economists, this [reflects a deeper **structural
issue**]{.underline}: [the secular [**decline** in]{.mark} the **[rate
of profit]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Evidence suggests]{.underline} that
[profit rates across the G7 have **[fallen]{.mark}** by roughly
**[40%]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the past half-century. This [chronic
fall in profitability **[undermines]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [very
engine of **[capitalist accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[leading
to]{.mark} **sluggish investment**]{.underline}, **[[diminished
growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and speculative forays into financial
markets]{.underline}. The [expanding role of debt]{.underline} -- with
corporate borrowing soaring even as profits falter -- [underscores
capital's]{.underline} desperate [search for returns]{.underline}.
[Global **[debt levels]{.mark}** have [**ballooned** to]{.mark} over
**[300%]{.mark}** of world GDP]{.underline}, [[revealing]{.mark} the
**[unsustainable]{.mark} contradictions** of the current

The [positivity is **misplaced**]{.underline}. [Even on the transition
from dirty to clean power]{.underline}, [the world is still
**failing**]{.underline}. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has
estimated that [both electricity generation from **[coal]{.mark}** and
**[gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and total power-sector CO2 emissions,
[continued to **[grow]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2023[, [to **all-time
highs**]{.mark}]{.underline} of 17,252 TWh and 13,575 Mt CO2,
respectively. In other words, [even as [renewables]{.mark} are **growing

enough]{.mark}** to displace dirty power generation,]{.underline} [which
remains the single **largest source** of **g**reen**h**ouse-**g**a**s**
emissions]{.underline}.

Worse still, [the world is **failing** on the energy transition for
reasons that strike at the **heart** of capitalist

[private [firms invest on]{.mark} the basis of **expected

sector continues to be seen as the savior, and we are [setting
ourselves]{.underline} up [to]{.underline} continue to

Veiled by discussion of headline global trends in new renewables
capacity investment is the fact that almost all the incremental progress
is currently being made in one country: China. Trumpeting 2023's 50
percent growth in annual global capacity installations as a global
achievement is wrongheaded, given that China by itself delivered nearly
80 percent of the increment.

And the IEA, for its part, [expects China to continue to be the **sole**
meaningful **over-achiever**]{.underline}. It recently revised upwards
by 728 GW its [forecast for total **global renewables capacity**
additions]{.underline} in the period 2023--27. China's share of this
upward revision? Almost **[90 percent]{.underline}**.

While China surges ahead, the [rest of the world remains
**stuck**]{.underline}.

This raises a crucial question. [What is **different**]{.underline}
about the development of solar and wind resources in China from the rest
of the world**[?]{.underline}**

The main answer is that in [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, such
[development is capitalist in only a **very limited
sense**]{.underline}. Certainly, the [[entities]{.underline}]{.mark}
centrally [involved in building out new solar and wind farms in China
[are]{.mark} **companies**]{.underline}. But almost [all are
**[state-owned]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Take wind. [Nine of
the]{.underline} country's [top 10]{.underline} wind developers [are
owned by the **government**]{.underline}, and such state-owned players
control in excess of 95 percent of the market.

Moreover, the [state is far from being]{.underline} a
[passive]{.underline} shareholder in these companies. The [companies are
best seen as **instruments** wielded by the **state**]{.underline} in
the service of [achieving its]{.underline} industrial, geopolitical, and
-- increasingly -- environmental [objectives]{.underline}.

The best example of this concerns the [gargantuan 'clean energy
bases']{.underline} first announced by President Xi Jinping in 2021. To
be [built mainly in the Gobi]{.underline} and other desert areas by
2030, these new bases will [have a combined capacity of in excess of 550
GW]{.underline} -- more than Europe's total solar and wind capacity at
the time of this writing.

Such [development is **as [far from 'capitalist']{.mark}** as is
imaginable]{.underline}. [This is the **state**]{.underline}, [in its
most **centralized** and **authoritative** form [mustering]{.mark}
whatever **[resources]{.mark}** it needs at its disposal [to
ensure]{.mark} that [it **delivers**]{.mark}]{.underline} what it has
said it will deliver.

Add to this the fact that the [banks financing]{.underline} all the [new
renewables development]{.underline} in China [are generally also
**state-owned** and **directed**]{.underline}, [and a **stark reality**
comes into focus.]{.underline} [[This is]{.mark} essentially **[central
planning]{.mark}** in action]{.underline}.

Does the profit motive figure? To be sure, it does. But usually only
marginally, and it is ridden roughshod over whenever Beijing deems fit.

\*

[In the **West**]{.underline}, by contrast, the [[energy
transition]{.mark} has]{.underline} effectively [been
**[outsourced]{.mark}** to the private sector]{.underline}. Governments
are by and large relying on private firms, [[driven by]{.mark} the
**[profit motive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to substitute carbon-free for
fossil-fuel-based power generation resources.

Of course, this does not mean that governments in the West play no role
in the energy transition at all. They fashion and (indirectly) regulate
the markets in which renewables developers and generators operate. They
set targets for the scale and speed of decarbonization -- although it is
debatable how seriously such targets are, and should be, taken.

Most importantly of all, Western governments all provide support
mechanisms of various kinds designed to incentivize new renewables
investment, whether it is the United States' tax credits or the feed-in
tariffs and premiums more familiar in non-US markets.

But in two key senses, this is a very different government role than in
China.

Firstly, [Western governments do not **direct** renewables
development]{.underline}. They merely 'nudge'. [The Chinese authorities
**nudge** too]{.underline}, but always [with a **willingness to
move**]{.underline} into hands-on direction mode when necessary.

Secondly, [Western governments]{.underline} typically [do not
own]{.underline} and operate [renewables]{.underline} generating
facilities. The lion's share of such [facilities]{.underline} -- more
than 95 percent of installed capacity -- [are owned and operated
by]{.underline} the private sector: the exact mirror image of the
renewables ownership picture in **[China]{.underline}**.

The [West's reliance on the **private sector**]{.underline} to
decarbonize power generation [is proving a **major
problem**]{.underline}, and for a strikingly simple reason, albeit one
that is almost never acknowledged.

[Under capitalism]{.underline}, [[**profit expectations** drive]{.mark}
companies' [investment]{.mark} decisions]{.underline}. [Developing and
operating [**solar** and **wind**]{.mark} **farms** and selling the
electricity they generate]{.underline}, however, generally is
[**[not]{.mark} a very [profitable]{.mark} business**.]{.underline}

\*

How profitable are wind and solar power generation? What sort of returns
do investors earn? Inevitably, there is no single, consistent answer:
[returns **vary**]{.underline} -- often considerably -- both
historically and geographically. But most analyses of the issue conclude
that an [internal rate]{.underline} of return [of around 5--8 percent
would be what investors]{.underline} on [average expect and
achieve]{.underline}.

Little wonder, then, that [[companies]{.mark} accustomed to **much
higher returns**]{.underline} than this [serially **[thumb their
noses]{.mark}** at renewables]{.underline}. Most notable here are the
[big U.S. **oil** and **gas** companies]{.underline}, which typically
[do not proceed with new hydrocarbon projects unless returns of a
minimum of **15 percent** are anticipated]{.underline}. Asked at his
company's 2015 annual meeting why Exxon continued to snub solar and
wind, CEO Rex Tillerson responded witheringly, '[we choose not to **lose
money** on purpose]{.underline}'.

Why are [renewables returns so low?]{.underline} Numerous
[[factors]{.mark} conspire to **[drive down
profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but one is particularly
[important]{.underline}: **[competition]{.underline}**. Generating and
selling electricity -- an undifferentiated commodity -- is an intensely
competitive business in most Western countries, and the [growth of
renewables]{.underline} has made it even more so. [Barriers to entry are
**low**]{.underline}, [and sources of market power]{.underline} more or
less **[non-existent]{.underline}**. There is [no]{.underline} OPEC-like
[cartel in renewable electricity]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--Stranded Assets

#### Stranded assets. Clean energy [dooms]{.underline} capitalism.

But can [renewable energy grow fast enough]{.underline} in the market
economy to pinch off the use of fossil fuels and help fend off climate
catastrophe? [Unfortunately, it's **not likely**]{.underline}. Even as
the percentage of global energy generation from [renewables
increases]{.underline}, [so too does]{.underline} global energy
consumption, which means that [fossil fuel [**emissions** are]{.mark}
also **[increasing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The world's energy-related [carbon emissions **rose** by 1.7
percent]{.underline} in 2017 and [energy consumption
**grew**]{.underline} by 2.2 percent, the fastest rate since 2013. For
the past decade, primary energy consumption increased worldwide at an
average rate of 1.7 percent per year. [Power generation
**rose**]{.underline} last year by 2.8 percent with renewable energy
providing 49 percent of that increase and most of the rest (44 percent)
coming from coal. Globally, [[oil]{.mark} consumption
**[grew]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 1.8 percent, natural gas by 3 percent
and coal consumption increased by 1 percent. The key point is that
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**reen**[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}**ouse
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**a**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** emissions
[from fossil fuels are **[increasing]{.mark}**]{.underline} even
[[as]{.mark} [renewable]{.mark} energy use is
[growing]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To visualize the relationship between the growing percentage of green
energy and increasing total global energy production, imagine a "dynamic
energy consumption pie chart." A growing portion of the pie represents
green energy sources, so that piece of the pie is getting wider, but the
radius of the pie chart also increases with time to account for the
increase of global energy consumption. The pie is getting bigger and
bigger while the fossil fuel slice is growing longer (which is bad) but
thinner (which is good). Which process wins out? As long as fossil fuel
use is not decreasing, it doesn't matter for the climate.

People often get confused when fossil fuels and renewable energy are
discussed together, but the climate only cares about the former. The
latter has no effect. [Solar panels]{.underline}, [wind turbines and the
like neither help nor harm the climate]{.underline}. [The **only thing
that matters**]{.underline}, in terms of climate disruption, [are
**g**reen**h**ouse **g**a**s** emissions]{.underline}.

It is not enough for the percentage of green energy to increase each
year --- unless it reaches 100 percent of global energy production very
quickly. [Even if]{.underline} the rate of greenhouse gas
[[emissions]{.mark} decreases]{.underline}, [but [doesn't decrease
**fast enough**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we face
**disaster**]{.underline}. [What is required is that]{.underline} global
greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline} [decrease]{.underline} rapidly
[to **zero**]{.underline} by midcentury in order for the biosphere to
stand a chance of survival. Unfortunately, [even a **rapidly
increasing** percentage of green energy]{.underline} production [is
[**unlikely** to achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} that [under **capitalist**
market forces]{.underline}.

What About the [Carbon Bubble]{.underline}?

[[**Falling prices** for renewable]{.mark} energy have [led]{.mark}
academics]{.underline}, activists and investors to [warn]{.underline} of
[a]{.underline} "**[[carbon bubble]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [of
**[overvalued]{.mark}** fossil fuel **[assets]{.mark}** in the global
economy]{.underline}, which could [[lead to]{.mark} a **major
[capitalist crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent economic study,
published in Nature Climate Change predicted that a [**sudden
[decrease]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [value of]{.mark} fossil
[fuels]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [triggered by **low** renewable energy
prices]{.underline} --- [would [cause]{.mark} the carbon bubble to
**[burst]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and under the assumption of continuing
trends, such an [event will likely **occur [before
2035]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--Negative Value Accumulation

#### Capitalism causes its [own demise]{.underline}\-\--the accumulation of [negative-value]{.underline} renders production [insufficient]{.underline} to overcome the [crisis of sustainability]{.underline}.

**McBrien 16** \[Justin McBrien, University of Virginia. 2016.
"Accumulating Extinction: Planetary Catastrophism in the Necrocene",
*Anthropocene or Capitalocene? Nature, History, and the Crisis of
Capitalism*, pp 116-118\] 吳

[Capital]{.underline} does not just rob the soil and worker, as Marx
observes, it [necrotizes the **entire planet**]{.underline}. Here is a
"metabolic rift" (Foster 2000)--- between earth and labor---driven by
the contradictions of **[[endless accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
That accumulation [is not only productive; it [is necrotic, unfolding a
**slow violence**]{.mark}, occupying and producing overlapping
historical, biological, and geological temporalities]{.underline}.
[[Capital is the Sixth Extinction **personified**]{.mark}: it **[feasts
on the dead]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} in doing so, [devours **all
life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The deep time of past cataclysm becomes the
deep time of future catastrophe; the residue of life in hydrocarbons
becomes the residue of capital in petrochemical plastics.¹ [Capitalism
[leaves in its wake the disappearance of species]{.mark}, languages,
cultures, [and peoples]{.mark}. It [seeks the **planned obsolescence**
of all life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Extinction lies at the heart of
capitalist accumulation.

Today's [[debate]{.mark} about planetary crisis]{.underline} has yielded
the concepts of the Anthropocene and the Capitalocene. Both [[recognize
extinction but have yet to grasp]{.mark} its **[ontological
significance]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[for humanity]{.underline} or for
capitalism. What I wish to propose is that we recognize the
Necrocene---or "New Death"---as a fundamental biogeological moment of
our era: the Capitalocene. [The Necrocene reframes the history of
capitalism's expansion through the process of **becoming
extinction**]{.underline}.

[The [accumulation of capital is]{.mark} the [accumulation of
**potential extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a potential
[**increasingly activated** in recent decades. This]{.underline}
becoming extinction [is not simply the biological process of species
extinction. It is also the extinguishing of **cultures and
languages**]{.underline}, either through force or assimilation; it is
the extermination of [**peoples**,]{.underline} either through labor or
deliberate murder; it is the extinction of the earth in the depletion
[[**fossil fuels**, **rare earth minerals**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even
the chemical element **[helium]{.underline}**; it is [**[ocean
acidification]{.mark}** and **[eutrophication]{.mark}**,
**[deforestation]{.mark}** and **[desertification]{.mark}**, **melting
[ice sheets]{.mark}** and **rising [sea levels]{.mark}**; the [**great
Pacific garbage patch** and **nuclear waste**]{.mark} **entombment**;
McDonalds and Monsanto]{.underline}.

Here the process of [Necrosis is central. Unlike apoptosis]{.underline},
the process of programmed cell death beneficial to the organism,
[Necrosis is born of **traumatic injury**. Necrosis proceeds by
**autolysis**, a form of self-digestion in which a cell destroys itself
through its own enzymes action. [Capitalism is the]{.mark} **reciprocal
[transmutation]{.mark}** [of life into death]{.mark} and death [into
capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Necrosis is capital's mode of apoptosis,
[reproducing the **means of production** by its
**destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is both saprophytic and
parasitic: [it feeds on live and dead nature the same; it seeks to
render them **indistinguishable**]{.underline}. [From the standpoint of
the Necrocene, [capital appears as]{.mark} a species, [an opportunistic
**detritus feeder** producing]{.mark} mass [extinction]{.mark} in the
present [through the exploitation of past
extinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The more capitalism exerts its
planetary power through the intensification of surplus extraction from
Cheap Natures (Moore 2015a),² the more it necrotizes the world-ecology
it has created.

The Necrocene is the Capitalocene's shadow double, the future past of
its necromancy, its monstrous sublime and uncanny paradox. [Extinction
is the both the **immediate success** and **ultimate failure** of the
real subsumption of the earth by capital; [the ecology of capital is
constructed through]{.mark} attempted [erasure of **existing
ecologies**]{.mark}]{.underline}---ecologies that include humans.
Nothing embodies the reciprocal conditioning between the Capitalocene
and the Necrocene more than fossil fuels. Even if the Cheap Natures of
charcoal fueled capital's monstrous appetite long before fossil fuels
became a general form of energy use, early modern deforestation quickly
induced a shif from "shallow" to "deep" time. [By the nineteenth
century, world accumulation came to depend upon **fossil
fuels**]{.underline}---[the appropriation of the **deep-time decay** of
life. Here the Necrocene, but an embryonic omen at the start of the
Capitalocene, becomes actualized in capital's **novel conscription** of
deep time]{.underline}.

The argument for the Necrocene flows from a view of capitalism as
world-ecology, in which capital accumulation is understood as
fundamentally embedded in, and shaped by, the web of life (see Moore
2015a; also Parenti and Hartley's essays in this volume). [The
[Necrocene]{.mark} highlights the [relation between **capital
accumulation** and **negative-value**]{.mark}. That [latter
encompasses]{.mark} those [forms of nature]{.mark} that are directly
[hostile to]{.mark} capital [accumulation]{.mark}, and which cannot be
overcome through capital's **productivist logic**]{.underline}.
Questions of [[waste and toxicity loom large]{.mark} in Moore's account,
[including]{.mark} of course the rising concentration of **[greenhouse
gases]{.mark}** in the atmosphere. But waste and toxification are only
**part of the reality** suggested by the "rise of
negative-value"]{.underline} (Moore 2015b). Extinction must be
conceptualized in relation to the longue durée of capitalism.

[[We have]{.underline}]{.mark}, it seems, [[reached a]{.mark}
**historical [tipping point]{.mark}** [of negative-value
accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The nonlinear reproduction of
negative-value has clearly become an **urgent problem**---for capital as
well as for planetary life]{.underline}. The "entwinement" of climate
change and capital has produced a new contradiction in negative-value:
"[processes of [extracting nature]{.mark}'s '**free gifts**' (including
human labor) [and **toxifying the biosphere**]{.mark} (including humans)
[have]{.mark} now [reached a **breaking point**]{.mark}]{.underline}."
While negative-value accumulation might become more apparent with
capital's increasingly frantic efforts to appropriate surplus value and
restore Cheap Nature, its history is rooted in the origins of capitalism
(Moore 2015b, 5). [[The Necrocene]{.mark}, coterminous with the
Capitalocene, [is the]{.mark} **slow [emergence]{.mark}** [of the crisis
of negative-value accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--Jevons Paradox\-\--2NC

#### Energy efficiency is [worse]{.underline} for the environment\-\--degrowth is [necessary]{.underline}.

**Waligora '19** \[Lucja; 2019; PhD in Economics, University of
Economics in Katowice; "The problem of energy efficiency, known as the
Jevons paradox",
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344271331_The_problem_of_energy_efficiency_known_as_the_Jevons_paradox\]

[**Jevons\' paradox** is the production of the capitalist
system]{.underline} which in the macro scale is unable to conservation
of natural resources. This system [still strives for maximizing energy
flow and material]{.underline} - from sources to drain.
**[Energy]{.underline}** saved in capitalism, is [used for its further
development.]{.underline} As he put it Alfred Lotka, instead of the
minimum energy production, this system [causes its \"**maximum
circulation**]{.underline}\". Absolute energy saving (v different from
relative) does not World Scientific News 122 (2019) 218-230 -229- lie in
the nature of capitalism. This system has been sold to the gods of
production and profit. As Marx mocked: Accumulate, accumulate! That\'s
what Moses and I say prophets!

If we look at [Jevons\' paradox]{.underline} in in the context of
capitalist society, we will see that it [exposes the contemporary
**myth** that ecological problems affecting humanity can be solved only
thanks to technology.]{.underline} The environmental mainstream
economists often refer to the phenomenon of \"dematerialisation\" [or
\"**decoupling**\"]{.underline} of economic growth from energy
consumption and resources. [The increase in energy efficiency is often
regarded as **iron evidence** for is that **environmental problems** go
to past]{.underline}. Material savings and energy in context of a given
production process are not, as we saw it the above examples, something
new; they are entered in the development of capitalism. Every new steam
engine, Jevons emphasized, was more efficient than previous. As noted by
the sociologist of environmental protection, Stephen Bunker, Activities
aimed at the purpose of saving raw materials are older than the
industrial revolution and evolved into the history of capitalism.

Any view that [higher **energy efficiency** usually leads to energy
saving,]{.underline} does not take under attention to the fact who was
paying attention to Jevons. What is saved is for further investments and
multiplying goods, what with turn leads to increased demand for
resources. The fact that increased productivity results in increased
energy consumption and raw materials, it is not in The \"system of
capital authority\" is something extraordinary. As the authors of \"The
Weight of Nations\" (2000), an important work presenting research on
subject of material flows in last decades in five industrial countries
(Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, USA and Japan), Performance gains,
resulting from the development of technology and new ways of managing
were balanced by the scale of economic growth.

[In]{.underline} [the effect we have to deal with still growing
mountains of **commodities**, **decreasing** unit **costs** and an even
greater **waste of resources.**]{.underline} In monopoly capitalism,
goods are given an artificial value - a substitute for authentic human
needs. Is responsible for is a powerful marketing machine, and the goal
is to increase demand for these goods and increase in the value of their
exchangeable values for consumers. The [production of **unnecessary
goods** serves only to **achieve** **better economic
results**]{.underline} and it takes place at the expense of the natural
environment. In the current system, any [attempt to stop the process of
environmental degradation,]{.underline} however[, means an **economic
catastrophe**.]{.underline}

According to Jevons, the \"historic choice\" in terms of business as
usual is simple: either \"short-lived but true power\" or \"long-term
mediocrity\". Jevons advocated the first option - maximum energy
circulation. A century and a half later, in our much larger, more global
economy, the [stake in the game is not just national supremacy, but the
**fate** **of the entire planet**]{.underline}. Of course, there are
those who maintain that we should \"[live on a high rate and let future
generations take care of themselves]{.underline}\". However, such a path
[leads to a **global catastrophe**. The only effective solution for
humanity]{.underline} (including future generations) and the entire
[planet is **changing social production** relations and creating a
system where performance is no longer a curse - a better system in which
equality, social development, community and **sustainable development**
are the highest goals]{.underline}

### Sustainability\-\--Thermodynamics\-\--2NC

#### All energy production under capitalism is [impossible]{.underline} to maintain and causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--thermodynamics [prove]{.underline}.

**Dolack '24** \[Pete; May 30; ; "Capitalism Can't Overcome The Laws Of
Physics",
https://znetwork.org/znetarticle/capitalism-cant-overcome-the-laws-of-physics/\]

[**Laws of thermodynamics** versus **limitless expansion**]{.underline}

An interesting paper just published in the Real-World Economics Review,
"How entropy drives us towards degrowth," lays this out in six succinct
pages. Written by Crelis Rammelt, a professor of environmental geography
and international development studies at the University of Amsterdam,
the author concludes that [global **capitalism** "**annihilates** its
own **habitat**" and "devours]{.underline} the equivalent of an entire
Mount Everest's worth of [**resources**]{.underline} every 20 months."

That's a whole lot of resources! The number of months will be fewer in
the future because, structurally, capitalism must expand. This is the
dynamic of the system that is often obscured. The rigors of competition
force all capitalists to reduce costs and find new customers to
successfully compete; failure to do so means going out of business.
[With all competitors forced into this **endless treadmill, the** entire
system is dependent on **expansion** and the creation of new
markets.]{.underline} Now that capitalism has conquered virtually every
space on Earth, there can be no more geographic expansion. Thus the
[pressure of competition only becomes more acute, as does the need to
**extract** more **natural resources**, which will inevitably be more
difficult and expensive to obtain as easily reached materials are
exhausted]{.underline}.

Thus, Dr. Rammelt wrote, the search for short-term fixes intensifies.
"This [system demands continued **accumulation of capital** and falters
when hindered in this process]{.underline}," he wrote. "The typical
[response to the ecological crisis is therefore not to restrict economic
growth but to pin all hope on]{.underline} efficiency, circularity,
dematerialization, decarbonization, and [other **profit-driven green
innovations** within capitalism]{.underline}. In this exposition, I
argue that this [**hope is false** because entropy always
looms]{.underline}. Entropy serves as a physical measure of disorder,
and we observe its inexorable increase all around us: everything decays,
rots, disintegrates, and falls into disorder."

[Energy changes form but does not disappear]{.underline}, he notes, but
the second law of thermodynamics states that thermal energy (heat) flows
from the hotter body or location to the cooler. In parallel with this
law of entropy, energy flows from a place of high concentration (such as
a battery) to a place of low concentration (such as a toy), thus
resulting in a loss of energy for the battery. Entropy also shows itself
in the degradation of everyday objects: food spoilage, metal erosion and
clothing wear and tear. Something external has to provide supplemental
energy to keep a system from complete degradation. For the Earth's
natural system, that external is the Sun. "The [**biosphere** taps into
solar power to perform 'useful work,']{.underline} namely concentrating
dispersed energy and matter into" new forms[. "A]{.underline} healthy
and [well-functioning biosphere thus stands as the only force on Earth
capable of **counterbalancing** the **rise in entropy."**]{.underline}

[Nature]{.underline}, however, [cannot regenerate without
limits]{.underline}. Although new food sources are created, sufficient
for a natural biosphere and the life that inhabits it, "the metabolism
of the destructive beast called [**capitalism** expands too fast for the
biosphere to keep up]{.underline}." The metabolism of capitalism
[**outstrips** the ability of **nature** to **regenerate**
itself]{.underline}. (Humanity is using nature 1.7 times faster than
Earth's biocapacity can regenerate). "Ecosystems have evolved over
millions of years to optimize energy consumption in ecological food webs
and to delay and reduce entropy through biodiversity," Dr. Rammelt
wrote. "Tragically, [**growth-oriented economies** do the exact opposite
by pushing against this natural order and increasing entropy at a
**devastating** rate]{.underline}."

It's a physical world no matter what we wish

Substituting one-crop monocultures for more varied agriculture,
irrigation, more intensive use of fertilizers and finally genetically
engineering crops are among the ways that capitalism attempts to evade
limits. But soil degradation, the creation of dust bowls, chopping down
forests and pollution persist and become more dangerous.
"[Capitalism]{.underline}, in its pursuit of relentless growth,
[**damages** the very **biosphere** it relies on to mitigate its
entropy-amplifying activities]{.underline}." It is not a physical
possibility to overcome environmental stresses by becoming more
efficient or devising more ways to recycle more. Nature has its limits,
Dr. Rammelt writes:

"Can we not combat entropy through frugal and circular production? The
typical response to the ecological crisis isn't to slow down growth but
to rely on dematerialization and circularity. However, '[green
capitalism' **cannot maintain itself**, let alone grow, by merely
reusing its own **waste** and byproducts.]{.underline} Just as monkeys
require fresh bananas from the forest and can't survive on their own
feces, production systems require new input of low-entropy matter and
energy to function. The same goes for a forest that depends on solar
energy from space and can't survive solely on falling leaves. Shifting
to biomass as a raw material for production also won't save green growth
as it will intensify pressure on land, water, and soil."

At first glance, the fact that the [global economy recovers less than 10
percent of waste materials]{.underline} and retains only 28 percent of
global primary energy consumption after conversion would seem to
indicate a vast potential for improvements in the efficiency of resource
usage. But a closed system that loses nothing is simply impossible,
because [not everything is recyclable and]{.underline} because
[transmission **losses are inevitable**]{.underline}:

"\[E\]ven though we are far from achieving [100% circularity and
efficiency]{.underline}, the [laws of nature will always obstruct us
from attaining such a goal.]{.underline} To [counteract]{.underline} all
unavoidable [losses]{.underline} and inefficiencies, we
[require]{.underline} a constant influx of fresh[, low-entropy matter
and energy]{.underline}. This requirement holds true for circular
economies and other green growth models as well. The encouraging news is
that the biosphere can convert certain types and quantities of waste
back into raw materials. However, we should not anticipate the biosphere
to sustain this service at the same accelerating pace at which our
economies increase entropy."

Socialism or Barbarism?

That humanity can dominate nature "is an illusion." The [laws of
**thermodynamics** remain in place]{.underline}. "Consequently, a
[**growth-centered capitalist** economy finds itself trapped in
**futile** attempts to completely **decouple** itself from
nature]{.underline} --- aiming for a 100% circular, service-oriented and
zero-waste existence. This obsession stems from an incapacity to imagine
an economy that does not grow, where both the quantity and quality of
its metabolism remain within secure ecological and planetary
boundaries."

Therefore, the conclusion is inescapable that [an economy that requires
continual growth must reach a **physical limit**; reaching such a limit
is nothing less than **global environmental collapse**]{.underline}. Dr.
Rammelt advocates a "radically different pathway":
**[degrowth]{.underline}**. He defines degrowth as "a socio-economic
transformation aimed at [reducing and **redistributing** material and
energy flows]{.underline}, with the goal of respecting planetary
boundaries and promoting social justice." Although he does not give a
name to a post-capitalist system other than one of "degrowth," such a
sustainable system would have to be one that not only stays within the
planet's physical limits but provides enough for everybody. The material
basis for everybody to have enough to eat and a place to live
comfortably already exists; [such a distribution is **impossible under
capitalism**]{.underline}, [where]{.underline}, again, [production is
performed for a small number of people to accumulate massive amounts of
money with little left for everybody else.]{.underline}

China has a virtual monopoly on those 17 metallic elements, which are

Delegations from the US and China are meeting in London this week to

Nor might exports flow fast enough compared to past levels.

One auto industry expert, who asked not to be identified because they

It's something the expert has heard described by people in the industry

#### Even if transition happens it fails\-\--companies and people won't change their environmentally destructive habits. 

**Buller '22** \[Adrienne; July 26; Director of the Break Down, Director
of Research at Common Wealth, Won 2024 Zencey price in Ecological
Economics, Author of The Value of a Whale, "What's really behind the
failure of green capitalism?",
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/26/failure-green-capitalism\]

The [answer is]{.underline} increasingly located not in climate denial,
but in a [**proliferation** of **non-solutions** advocated by
**policymakers** and **business** interests with varying degrees of
earnestness and good intention, under the umbrella of "**green
capitalism**]{.underline}". These are proposals sold as urgent,
pragmatic tools for cutting emissions or reversing ecosystem loss, but
which in fact deliver neither.

Take sustainable finance. By some estimates, assets invested with some
sort of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria now top
\$35tn, prompting enthusiastic proclamations that private investors,
driven by rational self-interest, are delivering a greener future. For
many, it seems one really can "do well by doing good".

Unfortunately, this [sense of triumph is based on little
foundation]{.underline}. To begin with, criticisms of "greenwashing", in
which corporations and financial firms mislead customers and clients on
the ecological or social credentials of their products, abound. But the
[problem]{.underline} cuts much more deeply than a few bad actors who
bend the (typically voluntary) rules. Instead, the [underlying
motivation of ESG investing is not necessarily to achieve the "real
world" positive outcomes. Rather the goal is to **minimise exposure to
risks** -- whether **climate regulation** or labour disputes -- that
could eat into financial returns.]{.underline}

For this reason, many ESG funds hardly differ from "mainstream" funds
and indices like the S&P 500 (the basket of the 500 largest US
corporations). Vanguard's flagship US ESG fund, for example, has its top
holdings in Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Tesla edges in at number six,
followed by two different share classes of Alphabet (Google's parent
company).

There's a simple way to unite everyone behind climate justice -- and
it's within our power

It would be [hard to argue that many of these would be the companies
springing to mind when imagining investment in a **decarbonised** and
ecologically thriving future]{.underline}. Nor do some of them have
particularly sterling records when it comes to the "social" pillar of
the ESG acronym, whether accusations of human rights abuses and forced
labour in supply chains or allegedly illegal surveillance of workers.

Moreover, [while many]{.underline} might reasonably expect a major ESG
fund to be investing in the urgent transition to renewable energy and
sustainable infrastructure, instead, more than [40% of]{.underline} the
Vanguard **[fund]{.underline}** is [allocated to tech and
financials]{.underline}. Energy and utilities, occupied by many of the
**[firms]{.underline}** we might imagine are at the heart of
decarbonisation, [together make up **less than 1%.**]{.underline}
Importantly, this appears to be the rule, not the exception.

While some specialist firms use their shareholding position to earnestly
pressure companies to change their business models or allocate capital
to upstart clean energy firms, [much of the industry is interested not
in directly financing a **sustainable future** but in ensuring their
portfolios are aligned with one]{.underline}. In this sense, ESG can be
much better understood as a means of betting on the likelihood of a
greener, more sustainable future, rather than helping to build it.

Indeed, in one particularly striking study, researchers found the
strongest trait differentiating social-themed funds from their
mainstream counterparts was investment in companies with relative lack
of employees. From the perspective of minimising risks to private
investors, this is perfectly logical: no labourers, no labour issues.
From the perspective of driving positive social outcomes, it's hardly
cause for celebration.

The logic underlying sustainable finance is a problem for the argument
that markets are advancing a greener, kinder capitalism. Indeed, the
trouble for **[green capitalism]{.underline}** is that its [proposed
solutions **strain** to force the complexity of the climate and
**ecological crises** into the narrow frame of "the market",
irrespective of whether the market is a viable arena for confronting
them]{.underline}. As a result, these "[solutions" are increasingly
proving to be anything but.]{.underline}

The imprint of green capitalism can be seen in everything from a
fixation on carbon markets to the proliferation of ideas like "ecosystem
services" and "natural capital", which seek to divide ecosystems into
discrete "stocks" that provide services to the economy. By this logic, a
whale is valuable insofar as it captures carbon and impresses tourists.
To many, the idea might seem absurd, but with \$40bn in ecosystem
service trading in 2018 alone, these concepts are increasingly
mainstream.

Claims of the scale of finance committed to net zero are not curtailing
the trillions funnelled every year to the fossil fuel industry.
Worldwide, despite some 23% of emissions falling under carbon pricing
schemes, the impact of such schemes on overall emissions falls woefully
short of IPCC targets. And [despite **glossy images** of oil majors'
**"nature-based solutions**" and tens of billions in annual trading in
ecosystem services, **biodiversity** continues to **decline** at
staggering rates.]{.underline}

### Sustainability\-\--Bees\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism is the [root cause]{.underline} of bee extinction.

**Gallager '22** \[Ciaran, Member of YCL Brighton Branch, "Capitalism
and Pollinator Decline." Challenge Magazine, 2 Oct. 2022,
challenge-magazine.org/2022/10/02/capitalism-and-pollinator-decline/.\]//neev

As with most popular subjects, most of the narrative is dominated by
liberal points of view. The causes and solutions presented in popular
media are often along the lines of consumer choices. Individual
**[[farmers]{.underline}]{.mark}** are presented as having personally
**[[neglect]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed the health of [[pollinator
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, and citizens are encouraged to manage
their gardens or allotments to encourage more pollinator-friendly
flowers. Although individual lifestyle choices are important, it is the
underlying economic system which ultimately determines how land and
labour are used. Capitalism, where short-term profit takes precedent
over any other social or environmental consideration, has determined the
historical development of agriculture, and determines how we produce our
food today. What is rational according to the economic logic of
capitalism is by no means rational for people or the environment.
Agricultural corporations continue to [[monopolise food]{.mark}
production and [make super-profit]{.mark}s]{.underline} while working
class people go hungry, family farmers are displaced from their land,
and the environment is ravaged globally. Marx recognised the
**[[irrationality of capitalist]{.underline}]{.mark}** agriculture in
the third volume of Capital: "a rational agriculture is incompatible
with the capitalist system (although the latter promotes technical
improvements in agriculture) and needs either the hand of the small
farmer living by his own labour or the control of associated producers."
Therefore, to understand what is [[driving pollinator
decline]{.underline}]{.mark} it is essential to understand how
capitalism drives and shapes agriculture. Industrial agriculture
Agriculture is an industry where monopoly capital is aggressively
extending and entrenching its control. However, to understand the nature
of capitalist agriculture we need to view agriculture not simply as the
activities which occur on the farm, but also as everything which occurs
upstream of the farm; production of chemicals, machinery, and seeds, and
what occurs downstream; processing, packaging, retail etc. The farming
itself is extremely risky, with high amounts of upfront costs and high
risks of crop failure or low prices. For this reason, capital tends to
flow into these upstream and downstream sectors of the food production
process. Upstream, corporations now control huge amounts of [[chemical
input]{.underline}]{.mark} markets, machinery, and seed markets.
Downstream, there has been monopolisation of processing, packaging, and
retail \[8\]. Today, global food production is dominated by a small
number of colossal corporations. The worlds four largest fertiliser
companies control over half of production, the largest three seed
producers' control over 60 percent of the market for commercial seeds
and agricultural chemicals such as pesticides. Similar levels of
monopolisation occur in food processing and technology \[8\]. The risk
has been outsourced onto the farmers who must provide the land and
labour and are often locked into unfavourable contracts. The reluctance
of capital to invest in the farming itself explains why small and family
farmers are surprisingly resilient around the world. Despite land grabs
and rural dispossession continuing to generate hunger for the world's
small farmers, 35% of the world's food is still produced on farms less
than two hectares in size, despite only making up 12% of all
agricultural land. The resources and processes which were once present
on the farm are now produced and sold to the farmers by agribusiness.
The pest control once provided by parasites and predators are now
provided by pesticides produced by Syngenta. The [[nutrients for]{.mark}
the [soil]{.mark} are [no longer provided]{.mark}]{.underline} through
carefully planned crop rotations and cover crops but provided by Mosaic
in the form of [[chemical fertiliser.]{.underline}]{.mark} Seeds which
were once produced on the farm are now produced and sold by Monsanto.
The energy once provided by animals and manual labour are now provided
by the diesel and petrol which power the agricultural machinery. Here we
see how capital has commercialised and monopolised the resources and
processes required for food production. The on-farm practices demanded
by the need to produce short-term profit is also self-reinforcing.
Simplification of crop rotations, allowing the farmer to specialise in a
few crops, increases risk of [[pests, weeds, and
diseases]{.mark},]{.underline} requiring greater pesticide and herbicide
use. Simple crop rotations also cause **[[soil
erosion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, requiring high input of fertilisers.
Prices driven down by overproduction requires the cultivation of greater
and greater areas, reducing the farmers familiarity with their land.
Larger areas make other technology or practices that simplify the
production process further, such as genetically modified crops, more
attractive for the farmer. The irrationality of capitalist economic
relations lock farmers into a treadmill of increasingly intensive and
industrial forms of farming to stay afloat \[9\]. Although huge
increases in productivity have occurred over the past few centuries,
capitalism continues to generate poverty and hunger. According to the
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in 2019 690 million people in
the world were undernourished, or approximately 8.9% of the world's
population \[10\]. This is an increase of 10 million within one year and
60 million in 5 years, despite the world producing enough food to feed
10 billion people annually \[11\]. It is wrong to assume that the
industrial model is inherently more productive than organic and
alternative methods of farming, as claimed by the PR of agribusiness.
Recently a strong body of evidence has emerged showing that organic and
alternative forms of agriculture are just as productive as conventual
industrial methods \[11\], contrary to common dismissals of alternative
methods as unproductive. Some may claim that the industrial model is
efficient, however this ignores the costs associated with industrial
methods which are externalised under capitalism and are subsidised by
the public. This includes environmental damage, the huge amounts of
water and fuel required, and high public subsidies needed to keep
farmers in business due to low prices arising from overproduction. This
model of industrial agriculture was exported around the world following
World War 2 through the so-called 'Green Revolution'. This was a major
set of research and policy initiatives promoted primarily by
governments, NGO's, and agribusiness, pushing developing countries to
adopt industrial practices as a supposed solution to their hunger
problems. The Green Revolution attempted to depoliticise the issue of
hunger and reframe the discussion on mainly technological lines (the
"green" part of the name is itself attempting to be an alternative to
"red" solutions which advocated land reform). Advocates of the Green
Revolution often reference the 11% increase in per capita food
production and 16% drop in hungry people between 1970 and 1990, the
decades where the Green Revolution was pushed hardest. However, a closer
look at these figures reveals that almost all hunger reduction was
within China, the result of deliberate state investment and
intervention. Remove China's achievements, and between 1970 and 1990
world hunger increased by 11%. For example, in South America food
production per capita increased by 8%, but hunger increased by 19%
\[12\]. Today, capitalists are looking to Africa for another Green
Revolution, having already largely commercialised the agriculture of
Asia and South America. Despite what defenders of the status quo claim,
hunger is not simply a matter of technology and yields. Those who
depoliticise hunger often rely on tiresome 'trickle down' logic that has
failed to provide for people for decades: if we produce more that will
find its way to the worlds hungry. Hunger is driven primarily by land
and wealth being concentrated in a tiny number of hands. People rely on
foodbanks due to unemployment, low wages, high rents, and lack of social
support. In the global south, the best land is monopolised by local
elites who use it to grow export crops for the markets of richer
countries with greater purchasing power. The rural population are driven
to hunger by lack of access to quality land, debt, low wages, high
rents, confiscatory taxes, and minimal technical advice and support.
Industrial agriculture did not solve Britain or the worlds hunger, but
instead allowed agricultural monopolies to expand and consolidate their
power over the global food system, making a killing in the process.
Decline of food and other resources for pollinators The
industrialisation of agriculture described above is generally considered
one of the [[main cause]{.mark}s [of pollinator
decline]{.mark}]{.underline} in Britain and **[[around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One of the major ways industrial
agriculture has impacted pollinators is by expanding cultivated land at
the expense of habitats important for pollinators. These include
hedgerows and hay-meadows, which contain abundant and diverse flowers
able to provide pollinators with the food they need to survive. Changes
in agricultural practices themselves have also contributed to reducing
food sources for insects. For example, once complex crop rotations,
which may have used flowering soil-improving plants like clover, have
lost out to simpler rotations permitted by a high reliance on artificial
fertiliser. These factors contribute not only to a reduction in the
abundance of food sources for pollinators, but also reduce the diversity
of food sources, leading to more monotonous diets which can have impacts
on pollinator health \[13\]. [[Habitats]{.mark} which are [under
threat]{.mark} may also [contain nest sites]{.mark} which
[pollinators]{.mark} also [need,]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
underground cavities, hollow twigs, or even abandoned snail shells. By
surveying the flowers present on farms and estimating the volume of
nectar produced, researchers at Bristol University were able to examine
whether farmland nectar supply was sufficient to supply the estimated
nectar demand of three common bumblebee species \[14\]. The authors
found that during July and August, the period where most insects are
active In Britain, farms did not contain enough nectar-producing flowers
to meet their food demand. This is a period of summer which would have
previously been supplied by wildflower meadows. However, flower-rich
wildflower meadows have been a major casualty of agricultural expansion,
with the UK losing 97% of this habitat since World War 2 \[15\]. Changes
in the rate of extinction of pollinators can give scientists insights
into which developments in agriculture have contributed to declines.
Researchers at the University of Northampton looked at historical
changes in the extinction rate of bees in relation to major changes in
agriculture. An increase in extinctions in the 19th century coincided
with increased imports of guano, a nutrient rich fertiliser composed of
accumulated bird, bat, and seal excrement. Use of this fertiliser
increased the productivity of grasslands, reducing the abundance and
diversity of flowers by allowing grasses to dominate. Use of guano would
have also reduced the need to rely on rotational cropping, which would
have used soil-improving flowering plants. This was further exacerbated
by the development of the Haber-Bosch process in the early 20th century,
which allowed the manufacture of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser \[16\].
These changes would have caused major reductions in the abundance and
diversity of flowers available to pollinators in agricultural
landscapes. Pesticides Pesticides are probably the most controversial
and well-known driver of pollinator decline. As mentioned above, the
expansion of use of pesticides over the 20th century and its impact on
wildlife has been the centre of much debate and activism, most notably
Rachel Carlson's 1962 book Silent Spring. A class of pesticides called
neonicotinoids are a recent addition to farming and are strongly
implicated as drivers of bee decline. Seeds are treated with these
pesticides, which subsequently spread through the plant into the pollen
and nectar. They are also water soluble and can spread via soil into
nearby wildflowers. Neonicotinoids, being neurotoxins, can cause death,
paralysis, reduced foraging efficiency, and reduced navigation and
learning ability \[13\]. It is often thought that pesticide use is
essential for productive agriculture. However, the use of pesticides and
the extent to which production depends on their application depends on
factors such as the crops grown, their succession, and the complexity of
the farmed landscape. Practices which involve a small number of
cultivated plants, monocultures, simple rotations, and low areas of
natural habitats (which can act as sources of organisms which can
naturally supress crop pests) are perfect conditions for pests to
survive and reproduce. This model of agriculture locks farmers into a
dependence on chemical pesticides, eventually requiring greater and
greater quantities as pests become resistant (known as the 'pesticide
treadmill'). Diseases and parasites Other stressors such as parasites
and diseases further contribute to pollinator decline. Transportation of
**[[honeybee colonies]{.underline}]{.mark}** long distances for crop
pollination can spread parasites such as the Varroa mite. This parasite
can act as a vector for diseases such as Deformed Wing Virus (DFV),
which causes deformities of honeybee wings and abdomens, and has been a
major contributor to the decline of honeybees in Europe and North
America. The trade of commercial bumblebee colonies for pollination of
greenhouse crops such as tomatoes can also contribute to the spread of
diseases around the world. These diseases and parasites imported by
commercial bees can have devastating impacts on wild bee populations
\[13\]. A deadly cocktail These stressors: reduction in food sources,
pesticide exposure, and spread of diseases and parasites, can interact
and have a greater impact on pollinators than if they were exposed to a
single stressor. For example, exposure to noenicitinoids during
development can increase susceptibility to diseases and parasites. Other
parasites become more dangerous when their pollinator hosts are
under-nourished, which becomes increasingly likely as flowers decline in
agricultural areas \[13\]. The future of pollinators Here we see how the
intensification of agriculture has driven pollinator decline. Britain
was the focus in this article, but this process is continuing around the
world as farming continues to be commercialised and intensified. There
are even moves by agribusiness to commercialise the process of
pollination itself. Much like the other parts of food production in
which monopoly capital has entrenched itself, in recent years there has
been moves by corporations to provide "technology-based solutions" to
pollinator decline. These "technological solutions" do not address the
systemic causes of the crisis, but rather only offer new avenues for
profit by the very corporations creating this crisis, kicking the can
further down the road. A widely known and dystopian thought is the
development of "robobees", robotic drones which would supposedly do the
pollinating in the absence of actual pollinators. Incredibly, Walmart
has patented this technology. Many ecologists have rightly pointed out
that this will be a failure, with current technology being no
replacement for plant-pollinator interactions which have evolved over
millions of years. However, the fact that this idea is being seriously
suggested perfectly illustrates the logic of capitalism; any
technological (and commodifiable) solutions are suggested, no matter how
ludicrous, if it does not require any fundamental changes to business as
usual. A more serious (and feasible) development which has received
attention in recent years are genetically modified bees which are
resistant to pesticides. Discussion exploded following the highly
publicised colony collapse disorder (CCD) which occurred in the late
2000's, where honeybee workers would abandon the nest and leave the
queen with its larvae. Studies discovered that the primary cause of this
strange phenomenon was neonicotinoid pesticides interfering with the
ability of workers to locate their nests. The possibility of a modified
pesticide resistant bee has caused concern among activists and
scientists. Not only does this not tackle the root of pollinator
**[[decline]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but it may be another route for
agricultural corporations to commercialise the process of pollination
through patents. Pollination is one of the few processes left which is
collectively managed and not commodified, essentially still part of the
commons which anyone can use freely. Although this
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology is in its early stages, and such
ideas are [[opposed by beekeepers]{.underline}]{.mark}, scientists, and
activists, these developments are just a [[continuation of]{.mark} the
trajectory of [industrial farming.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In recent years there has been renewed interest in Marx's writings on
[[capitalist agriculture]{.underline}]{.mark}, in which he explained
that capitalism's constant drive to accumulate profits was
[[disrupt]{.mark}ing the [life-sustaining]{.mark} cycles of
[nature**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This was creating a "rift" in the
metabolism between human society and the natural world which, he argued,
threatened the very basis of human society. He came to this conclusion
through the work of German chemist Justus Von Liebig, who warned that
**[[industrial ag]{.underline}]{.mark}**riculture in Europe was
disrupting the Earth's nutrient cycle as nutrients in food were
transported from the countryside to the cities and later washed into the
sea as pollution, resulting in the **[[deplet]{.underline}]{.mark}**ion
of the **[[soil]{.underline}]{.mark}** and a build-up of waste, and an
explosion of disease in urban areas. The **[[overuse of chemical
fertiliser]{.underline}]{.mark}** to compensate for this was
**[[destroy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing "the lasting source of
**[[fertility" in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[soil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, i.e. its organic complexity. Modern
agribusiness and its commodification of food has replicated on a global
scale the kind of metabolic disruption that Marx observed in the 19th
century. In the neocolonial world, capitalist agriculture has been one
of the key drivers of deforestation and land-use change, creating vast
landscapes of monocultures such as palm oil plantations or giant cattle
farms for companies like McDonalds. This is triggering extreme drought
through impacts on the water-cycle, especially in the Amazon where
agricultural deforestation is also threatening to release a vast store
of ancient sequestered carbon, exacerbating climate change. The era of
capitalist globalisation forced many countries to prioritise growing
cash crops such as coffee or cotton for export on the world market, even
where the climate is ill-suited to their growth. This has destroyed
self-sufficiency, [[led to]{.underline}]{.mark} increased [[food
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}, and has been a key driver of soil
degradation. Major advances in crop breeding technologies in the 50s and
60s raised wheat yields by two-thirds and rice yields by about one-third
in the space of ten years, but did so on the basis of a massive
expansion of fertiliser and pesticide use. This effort was led by US
agribusiness multinationals as they sought to create spiralling
dependencies on their products. Intensively promoted in India, Mexico
and other neocolonial countries, these methods have led to a collapse in
natural fertility, creating a total dependency on huge quantities of
synthetic fertilisers. Now, disruptions in the supply chain of such
fertilisers are contributing to a global food crisis. Synthetic
fertilisers are not only harmful, but also limited as a resource. The
[[Earth]{.mark}'s store of [phosphorus]{.mark}]{.underline} -- nearly
90% of which is [[used in]{.mark} the global [food]{.mark} supply
[chain,]{.mark}]{.underline} most of it in crop fertilisers -- is being
[[depleted at]{.mark} an [alarming rate]{.mark}]{.underline}. At current
consumption levels it is estimated known phosphorus reserves will run
out in around 80 years. Capitalism has merely kicked the problem of soil
exhaustion down the road, deepening the crisis at every stage. The same
global processes have driven small and medium farmers all over the world
into debt, due to rising costs of fertilisers and pesticides. This has
forced many out of business and pushed them into ever-expanding city
slums -- a major factor behind the huge protests of farmers in India in
recent years. As Marx wrote: "all progress in capitalistic agriculture
is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the labourer, but of
robbing the soil." Control of the world's food is becoming increasingly
concentrated into the hands of a small number of multinationals. For
example, four corporations control around 90% of the global grain trade,
and just ten companies control every large food and beverage brand in
the world. The food sector is also becoming tightly coupled to the
financial sector. This is making it more susceptible to cascading
failure, which would have absolutely catastrophic effects for human life
worldwide. Under this system food is not produced primarily to be
nourishing, but to turn a profit. This means that millions of people go
hungry despite the productive forces existing to comfortably feed
everyone. For example, today 828 million people are malnourished and 44
states experience "alarming" levels of hunger, but at the same time
wheat is piling up in US and Russian grain silos as speculators are
unable to make money amid volatile markets. Factory farming of animals
is also massively wasteful of resources, including grain and water, and
produces 18% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The commodification of
animals requires the most brutal conditions aimed at increasing
efficiency. Animals are raised in tightly-packed barns in cruel and
barbaric conditions. They are selectively bred for the most profitable
traits, producing almost genetically identical animals that are dosed
full of growth hormones so they reach maturity as quickly as possible to
increase turnover. All of this means factory farms are also huge
reservoirs for viruses that can develop and spillover to humans -- a
particularly gruesome metabolic rift that capitalism has created.

\]

Climate change has become more significant within sociology and in the
wider world in recent years; this has led to a deeper exploration of its
causes, which, in turn, led some groups, such as contemporary Marxists,
to conclude that [**capitalism** caused **climate change**]{.underline}
and was also the reason the [climate crisis would not improve as long as
capitalism was around]{.underline}. This leads me to the questions this
article will aim to address: is capitalism contributing to the climate
crisis? What can be done to help remedy the climate crisis?

The simplest way to illustrate how capitalism contributes to the climate
crisis is through a Marxist framework (Urry, 2009), with Marx and Engels
comparing capitalist society to 'the sorcerer, who is no longer able to
control the powers... he has called up by his spells'. This is to say
that, [as capitalism has progressed]{.underline}, the
[contradictions]{.underline} within the system [have]{.underline} only
[grown]{.underline} and will continue to do so. In terms of the
environment, this can be seen in [large **corporations**]{.underline}
(such as Shell) being [**motivated by profit** margins and
**shareholder** value to continue **damaging** the **environment**
through]{.underline} the drilling and distribution of oil despite the
risks being known since these same corporations aided in making the
world reliant on **[fossil fuels]{.underline}**. This shows how the
contradictions in [capitalism]{.underline} beget even more
contradictions and [skew peoples's motives toward their benefit
over]{.underline} that of the [collective]{.underline} as any employee
at a company that profits from the production of fossil fuels has a
vested interest in the maintenance of fossil fuel production and, by
extension, the **[climate]{.underline}** becomes [**collateral damage**
in the pursuit of profits]{.underline}.

In 'Sociology and Climate Change' (2009), Urry uses
**[Dubai]{.underline}** as an example of another way that capitalism is
detrimental to the environment: through the neo-liberal status quo that
emphasises an abundance of choice and free markets. Dubai is a perfect
example of this; within a country that is only 53 years old, it is a
nation built to serve capitalists (hence its status as a tax haven).
Dubai [embodies]{.underline} the [capitalist spirit, with **non-stop
growth**]{.underline} that comes [at]{.underline} the [**expense** of
migrant **workers**]{.underline} resulting from the need to drum up more
tourism perpetually; there [always]{.underline} needs to be [something
new and shiny to attract more]{.underline} tourists
([money]{.underline}) to the country. Having lived there, I can attest
that there are constantly new construction projects being built. If this
wasn't already bad enough for the environment and a clear sign of the
over-indulgent neo-liberal ideals that Urry identified, then the fact
that many of these projects can end up unfinished is; this occurs as
developers are over-confident in the potential of a project for
investment, start building, then run out of money to build or tear down
the project, leaving hollow metal and glass shells in the middle of the
desert as a symbol commemorating our capitalist hubris. The desire for
freedom is fulfilled, but at what cost?

Various solutions have been proposed with the knowledge that capitalism
is contributing to the climate crisis. The ecological modernization
theory (Mol) acknowledges capitalism's contradictions while still
suggesting that the climate crisis can be remedied under a capitalist
system, arguing that the innovation that is facilitated by free-market
capitalism will ultimately lead to the development of new, green
technologies that mean our economic system will not need to be
overturned. Other solutions, such as the **[Marxist Treadmill of
production theory]{.underline}** (Schnaiberg, Gould and Pellow, 2008),
are more pessimistic about capitalism, with this theory aligning with
Urry's in the [belief that **climate change** is **inevitable** under
**capitalism** as the requirement for **constant growth** will lead to
**over-exploiting** the environment.]{.underline} Therefore, the
proposed [solution]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [climate crisis is
simple: **end capitalism**]{.underline}. Both solutions have their
merits, with the ecological modernization theory being the easiest
solution to enact. The treadmill of production theory aims to fight the
climate crisis on the widest scale possible by making huge societal and
economic changes globally. However, these methods have their drawbacks
as [ecological modernisation theory]{.underline} may [not]{.underline}
be able to [go far enough in addressing the **contradictions** in
capitalism and the treadmill of production theory having a goal that may
be **over-ambitious**]{.underline} and, even if possible, would take at
least years to put into action as it requires a change in the global
economic system. The solution for the climate crisis is not simple and
would optimally be the end of capitalism, until then, we as individuals
must keep trying to hold corporations accountable for their damage to
the environment.

### Sustainability\-\--EROI\-\--2NC

#### EROI. Extraction [decreases]{.underline} energy AND attempts for renewables cause a [mineral crisis]{.underline}.

issues around global systems crises and solutions, graduated with a M.A.

Earlier this year in February, the [EU-team released]{.underline} a
detailed [explanation of how]{.underline} the [model works
in]{.underline} Energy & Environmental [Science]{.underline}, a
[journal]{.underline} published by the Royal Society of Chemistry in the
UK. The [model points to a **perfect storm** of **converging
problems**]{.underline}.

The [model reveals]{.underline} that [**fossil fuel energy** sources are
approaching]{.underline} "**[biophysical constraints]{.underline}**"
[related to]{.underline} "Energy Return on Investment"
(**[EROI]{.underline}**)---an [efficiency ratio based on]{.underline}
the [quantity of energy]{.underline} needed [to extract]{.underline} a
certain amount of [energy]{.underline} from any given resource.

[**Oil**, **gas** and **coal**]{.underline}, [including
**unconventional** sources]{.underline}, are [experiencing a combination
of **increasing costs** and **declining returns**]{.underline},
[indicating an **overall decline** in **EROI**]{.underline}. This in
turn could reach a point where their [continued extraction becomes **too
costly** to sustain]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the MEDEAS model shows
that [renewable energies do **not**]{.underline} necessarily [**solve**
this problem]{.underline}, [due to **several limitations**]{.underline}.

These include issues like the **[intermittency issue]{.underline}**:
[wind energy]{.underline} only [works in areas where]{.underline} the
**[wind blows]{.underline}**, [and depending on
**seasons**]{.underline}, for instance. [Renewables]{.underline} also
[**require more land** to produce **equivalent** quantities of energy
compared to fossil fuels]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} they are still
[**dependent** on a large supply of **minerals** and **materials** to
produce renewable **power plants** and related
**infra**structure]{.underline}.

An EV revolution to avert energy and climate disaster

In their new paper, the team behind the MEDEAS model apply this
framework [specifically to]{.underline} the analysis of
**[transportation]{.underline}**, [which relies overwhelmingly on liquid
fuels]{.underline} largely derived [from oil]{.underline}.

The scientists argue that although not widely recognized, "[Most
**global oil extraction**]{.underline} forecasts [predict **stagnation**
in the **2020s** decade]{.underline}." This is due to the
[**stagnation** of conventional **oil production**]{.underline} since
around 2006, [and]{.underline} the ensuing [reliance on more
**expensive** unconventional fuels]{.underline} which are [also likely
to **decline** within coming decades]{.underline}.

Therefore, transitioning to renewable energy systems will be essential
not just to combat climate change, but to evade an energy crisis.

In particular, the study confirms the importance of shifting to battery
electric vehicles for private and public transport, describing it as
"the best option" for energy savings and potential greenhouse gas
emission reductions.

But there is a problem: [if we **continue growing**]{.underline} our
[economies]{.underline} at current rates, [it will require a level of
**minerals** and **materials** that the Earth will **not be able to
provide**]{.underline}. This is the case [even if heavy materials are
**replaced** with light alternatives]{.underline}.

For instance, the automobile industry is replacing steel components of
the electric motor, battery and vehicle body with wrought aluminum,
magnesium and titanium, or other composite materials such as carbon
fibre reinforced plastic. Yet "these [materials]{.underline} tend to
[require **more energy** and have]{.underline} a
**[higher]{.underline}** global [warming potential]{.underline} in the
production stage [than the **heavier materials** they
**replace**]{.underline}."

[Endless growth]{.underline} will [generate **minerals scarcity** within
decades]{.underline}

The [EV transition is]{.underline}, in short, a [massive **industrial**
project]{.underline}. Electrification of roads and rail will require
upgraded smart grids, complex routes connected to high power lines, and
regular battery-swap stations. The paper explores several scenarios to
explore how such a transition would take place.

In a continuing GDP growth scenario, the authors note that the [economy
begins to stagnate]{.underline} "[due to **peak oil limits** at around
**2025-2040**]{.underline}," but GDP is able to continue growing thanks
to the EV transition. This shows that the reduction in liquid fuels in
transportation can play a powerful role in avoiding "energy shortages in
the economy as a whole."

But [then the economy hits the **limits of mineral** and **material
production**]{.underline} to sustain this electric transition---in [just
**three decades**]{.underline}. And [this is even with **high levels**
of minerals **recycling**]{.underline}.

By 2050, in this scenario, the [EV transition]{.underline} will
"[require **higher amounts** of copper]{.underline}, [lithium and
manganese]{.underline} [than **current reserves**]{.underline}. For the
cases of copper and manganese the [depletion is]{.underline} mainly [due
to]{.underline} the [**demand** from the rest of the
economy]{.underline}," but most [lithium demand]{.underline} "is [for EV
batteries]{.underline}," and this alone "[**depletes** its estimated
**global reserves**]{.underline}."

[Mineral depletion takes place **even with**]{.underline} "[a very
**high increase** in **recycling** rates]{.underline}" [in a
**continuing GDP** growth scenario]{.underline}.

In one such scenario, the authors apply what they consider to be
realistic upper level recycling rates of 57 percent, 30 percent and 74
percent to copper, lithium and manganese respectively. These are based
on extremely optimistic projections of recycling capabilities relative
to their costs.

But still they find that [even]{.underline} these [**high recycling**
rates wouldn't prevent **depletion** of **all**]{.underline} current
estimated **[reserves]{.underline}** by 2050. The conclusion
[corroborates findings of other **studies**]{.underline}, estimating an
expected **[bottleneck]{.underline}** for lithium [by]{.underline}
2042-2045 and for manganese by **[2038]{.underline}**-2050.

Actual bottlenecks could [come **even earlier** because]{.underline}
existing [studies]{.underline}---including the MEDEAS model---[don't
account for **material requirements** needed for **internal
wiring**]{.underline}, the EV motor, EV chargers, building and
maintaining the grid to connect and charge EV batteries, the catenaries
to electrify the railways, as well as inherent difficulties in recycling
metals.

### Sustainability\-\--Thermodynamics\-\--2NC

#### Thermodynamics. Capitalism is [energy-depleting]{.underline}.

**Ikerd 25** --- John Ikerd, formerly worked as a professor Emeritus of
Agricultural Economics at the University of Missouri, graduated with a
BS, MS, and Ph.D. degrees in agricultural economics from University of
Missouri, 2025 (\"Sustainable Capitalism: Our Best Hope for the
Future\", *University of Missouri*, July 23^rd^, Available Online at

Accessed 07-23-2025) rj

There is a growing realization among an increasing number of people that
the [things we are doing]{.underline} to address today's challenges
aren't working, and [are **not** going to work]{.underline} in the
future. The [unending **military conflicts**]{.underline} in the Middle
East, the inevitable decline in fossil energy production, [and the
**climate changes**]{.underline} triggered by global warming
[are]{.underline} but [symptoms of **deeper**]{.underline}, more
fundamental **[problems]{.underline}** within all modern industrial
societies. [Capitalist economies]{.underline} are very efficient and
tremendously productive but they are using up the resources upon which
they must depend for their future productivity -- they [are **not
sustainable**]{.underline}.\[3\]

This is not a matter of personal opinion; it is [rooted in
the]{.underline} most [**fundamental laws** of science]{.underline}.
[Sustainability ultimately is a matter of **energy**]{.underline}.
Everything that is of use to humanity -- our houses, clothes, food --
requires energy to make, energy to use, and in fact, is made of energy.
All useful human activities -- working, thinking, managing -- also
require energy. And equally important, the usefulness of human energy is
a product of society. We are not born as productive mature adults but as
helpless little babies. We have to be nurtured, socialized, and educated
by society before we are capable of being useful to society, and that
requires social energy.

According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy can be used and
reused but can never be created or destroyed. However, the second law of
thermodynamics -- [the **law of entropy**]{.underline} -- states,
[whenever energy is used or reused]{.underline} some of its [usefulness
is **lost**]{.underline}. When energy is used, it is [always
transformed]{.underline} from more concentrated, organized forms
[to]{.underline} more dispersed, [**less concentrated**
forms]{.underline}, as when we burn fuel in an automobile or fuel our
bodies with food. In fact, the usefulness of energy arises from its
natural tendency to disperse. Even though no [energy]{.underline} is
lost when it is dispersed, it [must be **collected**]{.underline},
**[reorganized]{.underline}**, **[reconcentrated]{.underline}**, [and
**re-stored**]{.underline} before it can be reused. [All of this
**requires** energy]{.underline} -- [energy which is **no longer
available** to do anything else]{.underline}. This is the [**essence**
of the law of entropy and entropy is **inevitable**]{.underline}.

The [only]{.underline} source of [energy]{.underline} available [to
offset entropy is]{.underline} the daily [inflow of **solar
energy**]{.underline}. The fundamental problem is that [capitalist
economies provide]{.underline} powerful incentives to use and reuse
energy but provide [**no incentives** to **collect** and **store solar
energy** for the purpose of **offsetting** the energy lost to
entropy]{.underline}. Even the solar energy captured through agriculture
and forestry is put in the marketplace for consumption rather than used
to regenerate and renew energy resources for future use. The basic
problem is that [economic value is inherently
**individualistic**]{.underline} in nature; it accrues to the individual
and thus must be expected to accrue during an individual's lifetime. It
makes [**no economic sense** to invest anything for]{.underline} the
sole benefit of [someone else]{.underline}, [certainly **not** an
unknown someone of some **future generation**]{.underline}. An [economy
driven by economic **self-interest**]{.underline}, as is increasingly
the case in all modern capitalist economies, actually
**[accelerates]{.underline}** the [process of entropy]{.underline}. Such
[economies are **not physically sustainable**]{.underline}.

Less appreciated but no less important, [capitalist
economies]{.underline} also [dissipate]{.underline} social [energy
because they **weaken** human relationships]{.underline}. Economic
efficiency requires that people relate to each other impartially, which
means impersonally. [People must compete]{.underline} rather [than
cooperate]{.underline}, [if markets]{.underline} are to [work
efficiently]{.underline}, and [competition **degrades** personal
relations]{.underline}hips. Economic efficiency encourages people to
work away from their homes and shop outside of their local communities.
[They make **more money** but they have **less time** and **energy** to
spend sustaining their families and communities]{.underline}. Modern
capitalist economies turn human relationships into economic
transactions, [**depleting** the **social energy**]{.underline} needed
to create productive people, thus accelerating the depletion of social
energy. Such [economies are not **socially sustainable**]{.underline}.

In addition, [all economic value comes either from **nature** or
**society**]{.underline}. **[An economy creates nothing]{.underline}**;
it is simply a means of facilitating our individual relationships with
each other and with the earth. [If we continue to extract]{.underline}
from nature and [to **exploit** society]{.underline} for our short-run,
individual benefit, eventually [there will be **no**]{.underline}
[remaining sources of economic value]{.underline}. [Capitalist economies
take]{.underline} from nature and society [but **give nothing back** to
sustain either nature or society]{.underline}. Today's [capitalist
economies are **accelerating**]{.underline} the tendency toward
[economic entropy and]{.underline} quite simply [are not **economically
sustainable**]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: CCS\-\--2NC

#### Capitalist CCS [fails]{.underline}\-\--its used as a [distraction]{.underline} from fossil fuel dependence.

**Yu '22** \[Jonathan; November 26; Science and Tech Editor for Monarch;
"Carbon Capture and Storage: Late Stage Capitalism and Inevitable
Demise",
https://amhsnews.org/7757/opinions/carbon-capture-and-storage-late-stage-capitalism-and-inevitable-demise/\]

It's fine, though. It's fine. Capitalism is responsible for the reckless
destruction of the environment for profit, but it'll also innovate and
create green tech and carbon capture solutions to solve the **[climate
time bomb]{.underline}**---right?

Unfortunately, no. [**Carbon sequestration** won't save the
world]{.underline}---[neither will **capitalism** innovate enough to
solve it. It probably won't even do enough to slow its
effects.]{.underline}

Green Tech revolves mainly around Carbon Capture and Storage
([CCS]{.underline}) which pulls the carbon dioxide out of our
atmosphere, [reduces its warming impact, and stores that carbon
somewhere else, far from the reaches of the mechanisms of
warming]{.underline}. It'll involve things like giant air filters that
remove carbon dioxide from the air. Forget net zero---we'll head for net
negative by extracting all the existing CO2 in the air! It'll be
great---not only can we stop the effects of climate change but we could
also revert it to pre-industrial levels!

[Unfortunately, that's not the case]{.underline} for many reasons.

"The reality is that **[CCS]{.underline}** [is more often than not a
**distraction** towards true neutrality that appears to resolve warming
but in fact only further entrenches fossil fuel dependence and
consumption]{.underline}."

Some of the most supported [CCS **projects**]{.underline} have either
[**failed** or are going to fail soon]{.underline}. A well-known example
is the Petra Nova CCS project. Once the crowning jewel of green
capitalism, it ended up severely underperforming and was subsequently
shut down. Other similar projects have similarly failed. [Filtering huge
amounts of air]{.underline} may simply [be too **inefficient** to be a
feasible solution for climate change]{.underline}.

Secondly, [CCS projects **use** an enormous amount of
**energy**]{.underline}. It [takes]{.underline} nearly [another **power
plant to power the system**]{.underline}. This [energy]{.underline} is
often [derived]{.underline} [from **fossil fuel** sources]{.underline},
meaning that the CCS efficiency gets drastically slashed. Making it even
harder for CCS tech to accommodate the vast amounts of CO2 pumped into
the air every day. 

Ultimately, the biggest failure of CCS is that it distracts from the
true goal of net-zero emissions. Despite its inefficiencies and
constraints, [CCS]{.underline} is [often **portrayed** by **oil
companies** as the future of society and our **golden ticket** out of
climate change]{.underline}. Sadly, that's not the case. In fact, [CCS
creates a false sense of security toward emissions]{.underline}. It
creates some sort of "carbon credit" to negate the impact of all of the
emissions. However, it's clear that CCS is simply too inefficient to
"balance out" the emissions of CO2 emitters.

[Companies]{.underline}, however, still use CCS as a "new frontier in
technology" that "innovates out of the world's problems" and promises "a
better future" without climate change. They [fail to mention the drastic
difference between how much CO2 is emitted and how much
**CCS**]{.underline} and other technologies [can]{.underline} actually
[reduce that amount]{.underline}. The reality is that [CCS]{.underline}
is more often than not employed as a distraction towards true neutrality
that appears to resolve warming but in fact only [further **entrenches
fossil fuel dependence** and consumption]{.underline}. 

The solution is to engage in regulation. Clearly, [**unchecked**
**capitalism** hasn't led to any innovations]{.underline} that would
actually solve many of the problems caused by human-induced warming.
[Once we **disengage** from the capitalist **mindset** of prioritizing
the profits from cheap oil, we actually have a shot at resolving some of
the impacts of global warming.]{.underline} Although it's going to
involve an enormous societal transition across nearly all industries and
massive geopolitical shifts through skyrocketing demand for REMs, it's
going to work. Unlike the facade of Carbon Capture and Storage
technology, regulation gives us a fighting chance. 

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Geoengineering\-\--2NC

#### [Capitalist]{.underline} deployment of [geoengineering]{.underline} is unsustainable\-\--it reinforces capitalist ideology.

**McLaren '25** \[Duncan; January 2025; Fellow in Environmental Studies
at UCLA; Kevin Surprise; Ina Moller; J.P. Sapinski; Doreen Stabinsky;
Jennie Stephens; "Profit-seeking solar geoengineering exemplifies
broader risks of market-based climate governance",
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589811625000084#sec3\]

The emergence of such [brazen for-profit ventures]{.underline} has
[triggered increased demands for governance of solar
**geoengineering**]{.underline}. In general, governance can be
understood as a mix between public and private authority, in which both
state and non-state actors shape circumstances and rules of engagement.
[Governance]{.underline} is, therefore, not simply the actions taken by
governments; it [includes the power and **influence of industry** and
individuals]{.underline} as well (Green, 2014). [Within]{.underline} the
current political-economic context defined by [neoliberal
capitalism,]{.underline} both [solar geoengineering
governance]{.underline} and climate governance more broadly are su[bject
to considerable influence by private, **profit-driven actors**,
rendering patentable technologies, emissions trading, and
market-directed investments]{.underline} as dominant climate mitigation
mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement, and current
national policies. These [climate]{.underline} [policies]{.underline}
emerge from and [**reinforce neoliberal ideologies** that private
entrepreneurship and technological innovation are key to overcoming the
environmental "**externalities**" associated with **endless economic
growth**]{.underline} (see Fig. 1). Powerful business lobbies fund and
advocate not only for specific interventions, but also a whole framework
of neoliberal political ideology, and policymakers are hemmed in by
market-based thinking, modelling and policy making (Sapinski, 2016).

Fig. 1

Fig. 1. Solar geoengineering start-ups as embedded within a neoliberal
ideological and institutional framework.

Solar geoengineering is gaining traction in part because there is a
growing recognition among scientists and policymakers that these
incremental, market-based policies are unable to respond to the climate
crisis quickly enough to stave off its worst effects. This points to a
contradictory conception among those advocating for increased
investments in solar geoengineering. On one hand, solar geoengineering
is proposed as a response to ineffective public climate policy. On the
other hand[, solar geoengineering advocates acknowledge that developing
and deploying the technology in an **ethical** way depends on effective
**public policy**]{.underline} (Parson and Reynolds, 2021). Many
prominent scenarios envision or imply cooperative governance of solar
geoengineering as a means to guide choices in the location, timing, and
intensity of deployment, (MacMartin et al., 2019), with some positing
rational deployment as a global public good, or in the interests of the
poor and climate vulnerable (Horton and Keith, 2016). Moreover, the kind
of modeling used to envision such scenarios often implies the
possibility of controlling deployment of solar geoengineering in great
detail, with intricate scenarios for carefully modulated and well
governed deployment used to illustrate desirable outcomes (McLaren,
2018). An unspoken assumption of many functional solar geoengineering
scenarios is thus that [governments]{.underline} -- [mired in
**ineffective** climate **governance**, beholden to **private
interests**, and **entrenched** in **market-driven policy**]{.underline}
-- could somehow find a way to work [cooperati]{.underline}vely
[on]{.underline} solar geoengineering deployment. Such a premise is
[belied by the repeated inability of governments to agree even on
initial steps towards such governance]{.underline} (McLaren and Corry,
2025).

On this basis, leading governance proposals devised to guide state
action on solar geoengineering largely assume an absence of governance
at present, and call for developing solar geoengineering governance
systems based on public, government-led research and development with
international coordination (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine, 2021). Under current political-economic conditions,
however, the highly idealized governance scenarios that dominate the
solar geoengineering governance imaginary reside in what Malm (2023)
calls the realm of 'pure fantasy'. These kinds of idealistic scenarios
do not grapple with more grounded realities where diffuse forms of
permissive governance enable private, profit-seeking actors to
proliferate, and fail to adequately acknowledge already-existing,
largely private, solar geoengineering governance structures shaping the
field (Gupta and Möller, 2019). This is evidenced by the fact that [some
of the same institutions calling for **"just"** solar geoengineering
governance are actively expecting and preparing for more funding from
**private philanthropic** and **venture capital sources**]{.underline}
(Hiar, 2024).

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Recycling\-\--2NC

#### Recycling [fails]{.underline} to solve.

**Verma '24** \[Shomik; September 30; PhD in mechanical engineering at
MIT, Paul and Diasy Soros Fellow; "Recycling isn't the solution to the
climate crisis",
https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/recycling-isnt-the-solution-to-the-climate-crisis/\]

All in all, [only **5% of plastic waste** actually ends up **recycled**
into new products.]{.underline} We might be able to solve the plastics
pollution problem by making all plastics we already put in recycling
bins recyclable. However, this approach obscures a bigger issue related
to climate change: the [**carbon pollution** associated with plastics
production. Plastics production releases more than **1.5 gigatons of
climate pollution** annually]{.underline} (comparable to the emissions
of more than 300 million cars), so [reducing]{.underline} these
[emissions]{.underline} is [critical]{.underline}. However, [using
recycled plastic]{.underline} to create new products [only]{.underline}
[reduces carbon emissions by 25%]{.underline} compared to conventional
production.

This is why the recycling rhetoric is so harmful. People believe that
recycling is good, but in reality [**recycled goods** don't always end
up **reprocessed**,]{.underline} and those that are don't significantly
reduce climate pollution. This might feel like climate fatalism: Even
recycling doesn't help? To be sure, recycling has brought increased
awareness about environmentalism, but it has become an end goal instead
of a bridge for further climate action.

By successfully shifting environmental responsibility onto consumers,
[plastic producers have remained free to pollute with **limited
consequences**.]{.underline} It is time to push back on the lobbying
efforts by the plastics industry, which has hyped the recycling
narrative to retain existing business practices.

We must solve the root cause of the issue: the [**lack of clean
alternatives** to existing plastics that are also cheap]{.underline}. As
alluded to above, there are two harmful characteristics of plastics:
carbon pollution due to the fossil fuels used when producing them, and
plastics pollution caused by dumping. We need to solve both problems.

[**Plastic** production consumes a lot of energy because many plastic
products require **high-temperature** processing during
manufacturing.]{.underline} The heat typically comes from the combustion
of fossil fuels, which results in CO2 emissions. Recent advances in
clean heating could help manufacturers make the switch to either
low-carbon fuels or electrified heating powered by renewables.

At the other end of its life cycle, [plastic is extremely durable and
can take 20 to **500 years to decompose**, often into microplastics that
may be **harmful to health**.]{.underline} Advances in biodegradable or
compostable plastics could address the plastics pollution problem by
creating alternative chemistries that retain the attractive properties
of conventional plastics but degrade more quickly and to a greater
extent.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Carbon Tax/Pricing\-\--2NC

#### Carbon pricing and taxes are a [false]{.underline} solution\-\--it incentivizes [more pollution]{.underline}. 

**Bernal '25** \[Julia; July 7; Executive and EJ Director of PAA, M.A in
Hydrology and Water Sciences, M.A in Environmental Planning; "Capitalist
Solutions WON'T Solve Climate Change: Carbon Pricing is a FALSE solution
and not for NM",
https://www.puebloactionalliance.org/blog/capitalist-solutions-wont-solve-climate-change-carbon-pricing-is-a-false-solution-and-not-for-nm\]

[**Carbon Pricing** are **false solutions** to mediate climate
change]{.underline} and don't even address climate justice. Carbon
pricing is also called carbon markets, carbon trading, carbon offsets,
carbon credits, emissions trading, and cap and trade. [Carbon pricing
terms are "**green-washing**" just transition solutions]{.underline}.
   

Carbon credits or carbon trading are [programs for big polluters of oil
and gas]{.underline} like Shell and Chevron [to buy "carbon-credits" to
**offset their emissions**.]{.underline} They are like coupons for
carbon and GHG emissions. **[Big polluters]{.underline}** can buy carbon
credits for pennies and [get **tax incentives** from the IRS to "offset"
their carbon.]{.underline} They essentially are [buying their way out of
cutting carbon emissions]{.underline}. This [allows for big polluters to
**pollute** even **more**.]{.underline} In order for there to be a
carbon market, carbon still needs to be emitted into the atmosphere;
[this a global capitalist scam.]{.underline}

So why is this bad for New Mexico? Gov. Lujan-Grisham's 2019 NM [climate
strategy leads to **false solutions** to "cut" emissions like carbon and
other **greenhouse gases** through "market-based
solutions."]{.underline} This means the potential of passing policies
that implement carbon trading and carbon taxes for the big polluters but
a possibility for a consumer's carbon tax as well. A [carbon tax
wouldn't scare off **oil and gas production** because they'd be able to
enter carbon trading programs and just **buy carbon credits** to achieve
net zero carbon emissions.]{.underline} Meaning, they wouldn't be really
cutting emissions at all.

Proponents of growth work so hard to defend their vision of ever-rising
GDP because on some level they believe that GDP represents social
use-value and provisioning, in other words, access to the things we need
to live well. But this is a naïve view[. GDP is a measure of
prices]{.underline}---and specifically the prices of commodified goods
and services. So [growth is an increase in **commodification** and
commodity production]{.underline} (which may or may not have to do with
use-value and provisioning). This is an important distinction.
**[Degrowth]{.underline}** scholarship calls for a reduction of
aggregate commodity production in high-income nations to reduce energy
and resource throughput, and [argues that **social value** and
provisioning can be **improved** even as commodity production
declines]{.underline}.

It is not difficult to imagine how this might play out. For instance, if
we were to ban planned obsolescence and double product lifespans, this
would lead to a reduction of commodity production and throughput (and
therefore probably also a reduction in GDP), but use-value would clearly
improve. If we scaled down the automobile industry and expanded public
transport, cycling, and pedestrian accessibility, the GDP of the
transport sector would decline but access to mobility would improve. If
we limit advertising, product sales will decline but people's sense of
wellbeing would improve (Torres, 2020). Or [if we decommodify the US
healthcare system and guarantee universal access, the GDP of the
healthcare sector will decline]{.underline}, [but access to healthcare
provisioning will]{.underline} [improve]{.underline}. We have clear
evidence of this: total healthcare expenditure per capita in the UK is
60% less than in the US, though it delivers superior health outcomes.

As these examples illustrate, provisioning and GDP quite often move
inversely to one another. This is known as the [**Lauderdale**
**Paradox**]{.underline}. In the early 1800s, the Earl of Lauderdale
pointed out that the [enclosure and **commodification** of commons may
**increase GDP**]{.underline} (what he called "private riches") [but
only by **reducing** people's **access** to key resources]{.underline}
(what he called "public wealth"), because suddenly they have to pay for
it. Commodification also creates growth imperatives: in order to buy
access to commodified goods, people have to earn more income than would
otherwise be necessary, and to do that they have to produce and sell
more commodities. [It becomes a **vicious circle**.]{.underline}

The solution is to decommodify, and expand key social goods

In Less is more, I argue that [we should decommodify key **social
goods** and establish a full range of **universal** **public
services**]{.underline}---not only healthcare, education, and transport,
but housing, water, energy, and internet---[so that everyone can
**access** the resources they need to live well, without needing
ever-rising **commodity production** and income in order to do
so]{.underline}. Note that this approach improves what I call the
"welfare purchasing power" of income. If the cost of housing is halved
by rent controls, my ability to access housing improves without any
increase in my income; in fact, I could work and earn less and still
meet my needs. [If any of these policies cause GDP to decline, that is
okay, because people's well-being will go up---and that is what
matters.]{.underline}

The key, then, is to specify what exactly is decreasing in a degrowth
scenario; namely, aggregate commodity production, and material and
energy throughput. [We will end up with an economy characterized by
**less** commodity **consumption**, but more equality, more **access to
public goods**, and higher levels of well-being]{.underline}.

Stéphane and I agree that resource and energy use need to decline. So
let us say we impose a cap and scale it down each year until we reach
sustainable levels, while reallocating resources such that everyone's
needs are met. If Stéphane is right, perhaps GDP will continue to grow.
But the empirical evidence indicates that in such a scenario it is
likely to decline (Steinberger et al., 2013). And again, that is okay. I
want us to grapple with this reality, to question our assumptions about
what GDP growth actually is, and to organize our economy in such a way
that we do not need growth in order to improve people's lives. This is
possible, precisely because of the disjuncture between value and GDP.
[We can create an economy that delivers good lives for all within
**planetary boundaries**, without needing to grow the
**GDP**.]{.underline}

It is important to remember that while green growth narratives might
seem fresh and compelling, they are in fact not new. They have been
dominant for half a century now, always promising that salvation is near
at hand (Solow, 1973). As I see it, [we do not have time to **wait**
another half century for growth magically to **decouple** from resources
and energy, when all the evidence says it **will not
happen**]{.underline}. As scientists, we need to take evidence into
account, and respond accordingly. We should focus on actively scaling
down resource and energy use, and organize the economy around human
needs rather than around capital accumulation. In Less is more I offer
ideas for how to do this (Hickel, 2020a, pp. 205--250); we should work
on refining and implementing policies toward this end.

#### Decoupling will [never]{.underline} work. 

**Gluckler '25** \[Johannes, Matthias Garschagen; both part of
Department of Geography, LMU Munich; 5/6/25; "Placing the Future"\]

[Those engaging in **post-growth** thinking challenge the assumptions of
the ecological **modernization policies** which over the last four or
more decades---despite some progress in reducing environmental
impacts---have largely **failed to decouple** economic growth from
material and energy consumption]{.underline} (see below).
Simultaneously, the [social benefits of an ever-growing economy have
proven to be **unequally distributed**]{.underline}---to say the least.
Other than being aspired for in the trickledown hypothesis of GDP-growth
oriented policies, little advantage (if any) accrues to large parts of
today's population, whereas other social groups profit considerably more
from an unbalanced benefit allocation---both within single national
economies and at the global scale.

Against this backdrop, the notion of [post-growth provides compelling
avenues of how to **rethink** the **economy** more
fundamentally]{.underline}. Over the past decade, it has been
increasingly taken up by social sciences interested in sustainability
transition (D'Alisa, Demaria, & Kallis, 2014; Kallis, 2018; Lange, Hülz,
Schmid, & Schulz, 2022; Schmelzer, Vetter, & Vansintjan, 2022). Economic
Geography, a sub-discipline of Human Geography, shall serve as a
disciplinary case here, whereby much of the following can be generalized
for, or easily adapted to, other disciplinary perspectives. The
particular [curiosity of economic geographers seems to be driven by at
least two different motivations: a) the recognition of the **physical
limits** to growth and the impacts **resource scarcity** and
**ecological imperatives** will have on the spatial organization of the
economy, and b) the observation that **emerging postgrowth** practices
can transform places and spatial patterns as well as create new spaces
of economic exchange, knowledge creation, and wealth
production.]{.underline} Both aspects imply the need to reconsider some
of the established conceptual assumptions as well as methodological
practices of our discipline.

My aim in this paper is twofold: On the one hand, I seek to assess the
conceptual and empirical potential of post-growth research, starting
from a self-critical reflection on the growth-fixated perspective of
mainstream economic geography models and concepts. On the other hand, I
discuss possible modes to operationalize postgrowth principles for the
purpose of regional development and innovation research. That is, I will
not provide a concrete imaginary of a hypothetical post-growth future.
Rather, I aim to access and understand trends and building blocks of
ongoing or emerging post-growth-oriented transition trajectories.
Assuming that the prevailing economic system will need to undergo a
profound transformation towards more ecological and socially just
principles, I may equally challenge core assumptions, reference systems,
and (not least) methodological perspectives.

This chapter's structure unfolds as follows: First, I will elaborate on
the terminology around notions of degrowth and post-growth and further
comment on the concept's uptake in economic geography and cognate
disciplines. I will then discuss illustrative examples of how economic
geography models and their ontologies--- implicitly or
explicitly---remain anchored in infinite growth logics, and where their
concepts and terminology may need to be adapted to alternative
understandings of economic wealth and societal prosperity. I will
thirdly outline two recent approaches that may help to translate
post-growth ideas into a new framework to assess regional development
trajectories or the dynamics and transformations within single
industries or firms. Finally, I will critically reflect upon the
normativity and positionality of much of the current post-growth
literature.

Key Blocks of Degrowth/Post-Growth Debates

Growth-criticism is not new and partly goes back to the early stages of
capitalism. [Its supporters essentially target the negative social and
ecological **externalities** of a growth economy, and question the
systemic **growth-oriented** logics of the prevailing production,
financing, and taxation systems, as well as **misleading incentives**
and subsidies]{.underline}. Moreover, [they disagree with how economic
development and wealth is monitored and **challenge** utilizing the
**GDP** as the predominant indicator for its manifest
shortcomings]{.underline} (see Schulz & Bailey, 2014, for a more
detailed discussion). As indicated in the introduction, this growth
criticism has regained momentum over the last decade and has a strong
role in the debate around post-growth futures. [This recent
debate]{.underline} has simultaneously been nurtured by the coincidence
of several overlaying crises as it [has been triggered by the increasing
recognition that hitherto efforts to increase resource and **energy
efficiency** in the production system through technological advances
have not led to the aspired decoupling of economic development from
resource consumption. At best, a **relative decoupling** can be
observed---that is, the GDP's growth rate is higher than the increase in
material consumption]{.underline}. As can be seen in Figure 9.1's global
statistics, both rates continue to grow in absolute terms. That is, [an
**actual decoupling** as propagated by those promoting international
agendas such as "**green economy**" (UNEP, 2011) or "sustainable growth"
(European Commission, 2010) remains **unattainable**---what Nico Paech
(2010) called the "**myth of decoupling**." Despite all efficiency
efforts, some authors even expect a "**recoupling**"]{.underline}
(Hickel, 2020, p. 154). Although too early to judge, there is some
reason to believe that the recent EU Green Deal (European Commission,
2019) and its promised twin transition (digital and just) may also
adhere to a rather non-disruptive, weak ecological modernization logic
(Schulz, 2022).

In other words[, the search for increased **resource efficiency**
through technological and organizational change has not provided the
expected results]{.underline}, even though efficiency gains could be
achieved in many areas. Yet [most achievements have so far been
outweighed by increased **resource consumption** elsewhere---known as
the **Jevons paradox**]{.underline} (Jevons, 1865[) or **rebound
effect**. The latter can be direct]{.underline} (e.g., a car with a more
efficient fuel engine may be used more often or for driving faster) [or
indirect]{.underline} (reduced heating costs after building insulation
may lead to resource-intense expenditures in other areas, such as for an
additional holiday flight).

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Renewables\-\--2NC

#### Renewables [won't]{.underline} work under [capitalist ideology]{.underline}.

**Empson '25** \[Martin; February 20; Editor of System Change Not
Climate Change, Author of Socialism or Extinction: The Meaning of
Revolution in a Time of Ecological Crisis "What's stopping a transition
to renewable energy?",
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2025/02/20/renewable-energy-why-the-price-is-wrong/\]

Examining this sector in detail should tell us a great deal about
capitalism. The problem is that [Christophers]{.underline} does not
believe that generalisations about capitalism's destructive
environmental behaviour are possible. He [argues]{.underline} that
[capitalism's **failure** to deliver **environmentally sustainable**
practices is not because of the nature of its production, but rather
because doing this is not **profitable** enough]{.underline}. "If
greening business were more profitable than business as usual, then,
certainly, capitalism would comprehensively be going green."

There is some truth to this, but [it is not sufficient to explain
**capitalism's destruction** of the **environment**]{.underline} (or
anything else). While Christophers quotes Karl Marx approvingly in terms
of understanding capitalist production as being geared towards profit,
he rejects the further insights that Marx developed from this.

He explicitly rejects the ecological Marxist view that capitalism is
inherently anti-ecological. On the contrary, the [problem is just that
capitalism in its present form is **"ill-equipped**" to replace **fossil
fuels** with renewables]{.underline}. "If greening business were more
profitable... capitalism would comprehensively be going green."

"The environmental impact of capitalism is contingent, not fundamental.
If it is true that contemporary capitalism unavoidably destroys the
environment, then it is true only in an indirect sense: which is to say,
because the underlying search for profit --- capital's true animus ---
and thus for growth itself happens to be environmentally destructive."

For Marx, the [issue]{.underline} wasn't just growth, but the fact that
the [construction of the capitalist economy]{.underline} brought with it
the destruction of humanity's relationship to the natural world,
[creating a new **alienated reality** which saw nature subordinated to
the **accumulation of capital**]{.underline}. Growth in this sense is
part of the [inescapable **logic of capitalism**]{.underline} and the
energy system is an integral part of that system. It must be understood
in the wider context of capital accumulation.

That said, Christophers' forensic dissection of the energy system, in
the various forms it takes across the globe, is illuminating and often
devastating. One example will suffice to demonstrate his wider argument.

When Texas experienced particularly bad weather in February 2021, almost
half of the state's electrical generating capacity failed. Inevitably,
right-wing pundits blamed the wide use of wind turbines, ignoring the
fact that much of the state's natural gas-based infrastructure also
failed. Because the problem wasn't technology[. High demand for energy
drove]{.underline} up the spot (not contracted) [price]{.underline} [for
electricity]{.underline}, which is exactly how the so-called free market
is supposed to work. The price went from \$50 per megawatt hour to
\$9000, and some companies made out like bandits. But not all.

The owners of storm-damaged wind-turbines were contractually obliged to
deliver energy they couldn't produce, so they had to buy at prices much
higher than they would get paid, which meant taking on heavy debts. They
just couldn't afford to be in business, and the market collapsed.

The 2021 market failure is one of many in Brett Christophers' study of
energy generation under capitalism. It illustrates his central
point---that [leaving **energy** generation, **distribution** and
development to the **market** neither reduces carbon emissions nor keeps
down prices.]{.underline} Instead, [it leaves **consumers** and the
economy as a whole **vulnerable** to the **irrational behaviour** of the
**capitalist system**]{.underline}.

It is no accident that the energy system has ended up like this. In the
Global North it is the consequence of three decades of privatisation,
and in the Global South as Christophers points out, the World Bank
"aggressively pursue\[d\] the commercialisation and corporatization of,
and private sector participation in, developing-country power sectors."

The consequence is an [energy system geared]{.underline}, not
[toward]{.underline} supplying energy cheaply and sustainably, but for
**[profit]{.underline}**. Indeed, [this is the]{.underline} **[root of
the problem]{.underline}**. Cheaper renewables should be more
profitable, but for the electrical energy system as a whole, they aren't
reliably profitable, and they are rarely profitable enough.

Christophers shows that declining costs for renewable energy have not
caused profit-driven energy companies to choose them. Quite the
opposite. In their quest for the biggest return on investment, [energy
producers]{.underline} routinely [**abandon renewable** energy in favour
of **fossil fuels**.]{.underline} In spot markets, where [investors must
make **money** or die]{.underline}, "expected profit is highly uncertain
and unpredictable."

[Renewable energy]{.underline} is just [not]{.underline} very [good at
delivering profits in a **free market system**.]{.underline} This is not
lost on the fossil fuel industry. Christophers recounts how a group of
Franciscan friars, who owned \$2000 worth of Exxon shares, asked Exxon
CEO Rex Tillerson why he didn't invest more in renewable energy.
Tillerson's answer: "We choose not to lose money on purpose."

4\. Integrated World Capitalism, the Capitalist Axiomatic and the
**[Black Hole of Capitalism]{.underline}**

Deleuze and Guattari's collaboration also supplies one of the few
examples within new materialist theory of a micropolitics of capitalist
political economy---first in Anti-Oedipus (Deleuze and Guattari 1984),
then developed further in A Thousand Plateaus (Deleuze and Guattari
1988) and in Deleuze's (1992) brief discussion of control societies. In
this immanent perspective, ['integrated world capitalism']{.underline}
(Guattari and Negri \[1985\] 2010, pp. 48--53) is quite distinct from
other socioeconomic modes: it [is an 'international ecumenical'
**social** formation]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, p. 435)
[that transcends the nation-state, enabling the **globalisation of
production** and exchange]{.underline} (see also, Hardt and Negri 2001,
pp. 326--22). Nor is capitalism an evolutionary step along an inevitable
path to communism, as argued by Marx and Engels (\[1888\] 1952, p. 60).

[Capitalism]{.underline} has achieved this status, according to Deleuze
and Guattari, because in comparison to other economic modes, the
[movements and interactions of **money**, **commodities** and **labour**
are highly 'de-territorialised']{.underline} (that is, generalised in
terms of what they can do) (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, pp. 435--36).
This de-territorialisation [has freed the production and exchange
transactions of a market economy]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
social norms, stratifications or other [**constraints** that
**regulated**]{.underline} and limited the circulation of
[goods]{.underline}, [capital]{.underline}, and
[information]{.underline} in other political economies such as slave
economies or feudalism (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, pp. 453--54). On one
hand, there is now a de-territorialised worker, 'free' to sell their
labour-power, regardless of class, social position or other social
stratification; on the other, money that has become 'capital' is now
able to purchase both that labour-power and any commodity available in
the marketplace (Deleuze and Guattari 1984, p. 225; 1988, p. 453).

This de-territorialised free market in money, goods and workers
constitutes what Deleuze and Guattari called (Deleuze and Guattari 1988,
pp. 453, 457) the 'capitalist axiomatic', by which they meant a
world-wide drawing together (conjugation) of these three free flows,
thereby enabling [global **capitalist enterprise**]{.underline} to
[develop]{.underline} and flourish (Adkins 2015, p. 226). Guattari and
Negri (\[1985\] 2010, p. 26) described this axiomatic as '[one vast
machine, **extending over the planet'** and encompassing every aspect of
human]{.underline} life, including 'work, childhood, love, life,
thought, fantasy, art'. This global process is progressively
[incorporating all sectors of social production into its
ambit,]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the over-arching
[objective]{.underline} [of assuring **capital
accumulation**]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, p. 464).
Capitalist states are real-life manifestations of the capitalist
axiomatic (Deleuze and Parnet 2007, p. 129), with the sole aim of
sustaining free flows of capital, goods and labour by means of their
legislative, fiscal and regulatory powers (Deleuze and Guattari 1988, p.
456).

However, Deleuze and Guattari's texts (Deleuze and Guattari 1984, pp.
226--27; 1988, p. 461) only hint at how these free flows enable the two
key transactions of production and exchange that are core to the
capitalist economic mode. [To address this gap]{.underline}, [the
current author's recent work]{.underline} (Fox 2023a, 2023b)
[established an **ethological 'cartography'**]{.underline} (Deleuze and
Guattari 1988, p. 260), which mapped the interactions between money,
goods and labour in these transactions. This project began by
re-analysing Marx's (\[1906\] 2011) meticulous description of production
and exchange in Volume 1 of Capital. While Marx's focus was firmly upon
human agency and the capacity of labour-power to generate capital, an
ethological approach enabled analysis of these transactions in terms of
more-than-human affects and capacities in actual concrete manifestations
of production- and market-assemblages such as factories and physical
markets (Fox 2023b).

However, this ethological analysis also revealed further [affects in the
market-place]{.underline} not acknowledged in Marxist theory, though
[associated]{.underline} [with]{.underline} what classical and
[**neo-classical** economists]{.underline} called the 'laws of supply
and demand' (Marshall \[1890\] 2009, pp. 284--87; Moore 1925).3 But
whereas these economists considered supply and demand as a benevolent
means [to assure market **efficiency** and innovation,]{.underline} in
this ethological analysis, these more-than-human affects operate beyond
individual human intentionality (DeLanda 2006, p. 36). They link the
supply of commodities' relational capacities with the level of demand
from customers for these capacities (Fox 2023b). For example, stainless
steel has a capacity to resist oxidation (rust) when in contact with
water or moist air: a capacity in demand from multiple consumers of
cutlery, cookware, surgical instruments and other tools or components.
These [more-than-human **supply-and-demand**]{.underline} affects
[operate independently of]{.underline} both [consumers' **ability to
pay**]{.underline} and producers' ability to sell at that price.

It is these affects that not only regulate competition between producers
and between customers, innovation and growth in production and
consumption (Baumol 2002, p. 3; Smith 2010, p. 31), but are responsible
for various undesirable features of the capitalist economy. For example,
[to **sustain** market share in a **competitive** market]{.underline}
(Wrenn 2016, p. 63), [producers]{.underline} face a high level of
uncertainty about future sales of their goods or services, due to
competition, and [must make]{.underline} difficult
[decisions]{.underline} regarding pricing and staffing---in turn,
[leading to **employment** and **income uncertainty** for
employees]{.underline}. Competition between producers also [leads to
excess supply, resulting in **waste**]{.underline} (Horton 1997, pp.
128--29) [and **pollution**---including **climate change**]{.underline}
(Keen 2021, p. 1162). Differential wages, and hence capacities to pay
for access to commodities and services establish and
[sustain]{.underline} wide [material **inequalities**]{.underline}
between citizens (Fox and Powell 2021; Piketty 2014; Rueda and Pontusson
2000, pp. 353--54).

Crucially, it is these supply-and-demand affects that draw more and more
economic and social activity into capitalism's ambit. [Once caught up
in]{.underline} the assemblages of [capitalist production]{.underline}
and markets, both [workers]{.underline} and entrepreneurs [have **no
means to escape from**]{.underline} what might be described,
metaphorically, as [capitalism's 'black hole']{.underline} (Fox 2023b).
Advocates for a [**neoliberalised** free market]{.underline} and the
rolling-back of the public sector have [accelerated]{.underline} the
[rate]{.underline} [at which all human activity]{.underline} (including,
for example, education, healthcare, welfare services, public transport
and security services) [are being progressively drawn into this **black
hole**]{.underline} (Mudge 2008, p. 706).

"growth" dates only to the years that followed World War II. [It is
[younger than]{.mark} **Joe [Biden]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Mitch
McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Donald Trump. **[Like them, it cannot
survive much longer.]{.underline}** Last year, GDP growth in the United
States fell 3.5 percent. Emissions tumbled, too. The only other time in
the last three decades that they have dropped significantly was, not
coincidentally, also the last time the economy contracted. But if it's
guided with intent, the cessation of endless growth does not have to
mean impoverishment. The most recent "Emissions Gap Report" from the
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) projects that warming could be
successfully limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius if the richest one percent
reduced "their current emissions by at least a factor of 30," which
would allow the poorest 50 percent of the planet's population to
increase their per capita emissions "by around three times their current
levels." For the latter, a threefold jump in consumption is the
difference between constant want and a life of basic dignity.
Billionaires who drop to 1/30th of their fortunes are still
multimillionaires. As innocuous as it may sound, "growth" should be
understood to describe the frenzied ruination of nearly every ecosystem
on the planet so that its richest human inhabitants can hold on to their
privileges for another generation or two. [[Rejecting]{.mark} the
idolatry of [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} means tilting the organization

[**Economics** is a land of **fables**]{.underline}. One of the most
fascinating stories that a student of economics might have come across,
is the story of the Kuznets Curve. The story goes back to 1955, when a
brilliant American economist, Simon [Kuznets]{.underline}, gathered data
on the UK, the US and Germany. He wanted to observe how income
inequality had changed over time as these countries grew. When he
plotted this data on a page, he was astonished by what he found! The
graph seemed to [suggest that income inequality in these countries
initially increased and then decreased. This upside-down U-shaped curve
got drawn and labelled as the Kuznets curve]{.underline} and then took
on a life of its own.

But why call it the false curve? If it is on the graph, is it not true?
The fascinating thing is that it is indeed [true for those three
countries at that particular point in time.]{.underline} [The only catch
is that it was an immensely and exceptionally **particular point in
time**.]{.underline} This period was rife with all kinds of shocks, be
it the [Great Depression]{.underline}, the [World Wars]{.underline} or
the high taxes imposed to finance the war expenses. All of these
processes [emptied the purses of the capital owners,
afflicting]{.underline} both their [wealth]{.underline} and current
income. As a result[, this period witnessed reduced income
inequality.]{.underline}

Yet, the Kuznets curve was disproved in both the UK and the
[US]{.underline} in the years that followed. Both the countries
[witnessed]{.underline} an alarming [hike in the levels of **income
inequality**]{.underline}, primarily because both Margaret Thatcher and
Ronald Reagan lifted the high rates of taxes in 1974 and 1986
respectively. Unfortunately, [data]{.underline} from this period was
[**not projected** on the Kuznets curve.]{.underline}

In this regard, Thomas Piketty's book 'Capital in the 21st Century' has
developed on the Kuznets' theory significantly. Piketty gathered
extensive datasets on inequality in the US for a period of 100 years
from 1910 to 2010. According to this data, the share of the top income
decile out of the total US national income changed in the same manner as
Kuznets' paper until 1955. However, the [share increased dramatically
during the 1980s when **deregulation** and **privatisation policies**
were announced. The curve took an S-shape,]{.underline} initially
dipping frontwards and then mirroring the inverted U against a
horizontal straight line[, suggesting]{.underline} that the [Kuznets
Curve told us only **half the story.**]{.underline}

Further, the [central variable in Piketty's book is
**capital**,]{.underline} which [Kuznets did not take into
account]{.underline} in his review of income inequality.
[Capital]{.underline}, which is distributed more unevenly than labor
income, has a significant impact on the overall household income. Thus
it [wield]{.underline}s a [major influence over income
inequality.]{.underline}

This [**contradicted**]{.underline} not only [**Kuznets'** inverted
U-curve of the correlation between economic growth and income inequality
but also the very mechanism for connecting the two
phenomena]{.underline}. Moreover, the reduced levels of inequality
witnessed by the three countries in Kuznets's paper were not merely a
result of the inherent workings of the market. The curve bent down in
these three countries as a result of government spending and
redistribution of income in the post war period. [This suggests that the
context of the statistical correlation discovered by **Kuznets** was
more of a **shock** and merely incidental than evolutionary in
nature]{.underline}.

It becomes pertinent to mention here that Kuznets himself gave these
caveats when he first published his paper. The trouble arose when these
caveats got pushed to the side and the curve came to be used almost as a
mantra in policymaking. The widespread belief that things are going to
get worse before they get better again, pervaded largely due to this
little inverted U-shaped curve. The sway that this curve held over the
economists of the time is evident in the manner in which development
economics emerged. The founding fathers of development economics were of
the view that development must be an inegalitarian process. Equality
almost became a privilege that only developed countries like the UK, the
US and Germany could enjoy.

Subsequently, [when economists have gone looking for this Kuznets curve,
they haven't been able to find it]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline}
extensive [literature]{.underline} emerged in the later years,
[verifying]{.underline} the [existence of a supposed upside down U curve
in developing countries]{.underline}, these [papers were **largely
restricted** in the terms of the **extent of their data**]{.underline}.
There existed a lack of indices on the inequality levels of developing
countries and any [empirical study]{.underline} of the time had to [rely
upon cross sectional data]{.underline}, that is[, data collected at one
particular point in time]{.underline}. This means that these [papers
failed to emulate Kuznets own analysis by **not considering** the
**evolution of inequality** based on historical data from any particular
country.]{.underline}

On the other hand, the experience of East Asia since the 1980s (which
has come to be known as the 'East Asian Miracle') shows that some very
low income countries, that grew at an alarming pace, were successful in
reducing the levels of inequality in tandem with their ascent. This
defied the Kuznets curve and also the notion that equality is something
that the developing countries have to wait for until later. Moreover if
we look at some of the OECD countries, we observe inequality has widened
again. In fact income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest
level for the past half century. The average income of the richest 10%
of the population is about nine times that of the poorest 10% across the
OECD, a far cry from the levels that prevailed some 25 years ago.

[It turns out that this **curve does not exist in all
actuality**]{.underline}. Different countries can experience different
patterns of interaction between income inequality and growth. [There is
no law of economic motion at work here]{.underline}. The real question
is one of economic design. Part of the effort lies in not believing that
it is normal for inequality to get worse, rather treating it as an
outcome of the economic institutions that we create. Further, in the
21st century, we must go deeper than just redistributing income. We must
look at ways in which sources of wealth creation can be distributed in
an equitable manner. Most importantly, we mustn't have to wait for
things to get worse before they get better.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Aff Solves\-\--2NC

#### "Sustainability" is [philosophically]{.underline} and [materially impossible]{.underline} under capitalism.

**Rull 11** --- Valentí Rull, member of the Botanical Institute of
Barcelona, 2011 (\"Sustainability, capitalism and evolution\", *EMBO
Reports*, January 14^th^, Available Online at
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3049435/, Accessed 07-23-2025)
rj

[**Capitalism** and **sustainable development** are **mutually
exclusive**]{.underline}. To protect the environment [we
need]{.underline} to [develop **alternative economic
systems**]{.underline}, even if some predict the next man-made mass
extinction is already inevitable.

[Humans are **exploiting** the Earth in an **unsustainable**
manner]{.underline}, which is [accelerating both **environmental**
degradation and loss of **biodiversity**]{.underline}. Moreover, [owing
to global **climate change**]{.underline}, the rates of deterioration
and [extinction]{.underline} will probably [**increase** in the near
future]{.underline}. The scientific community has been highly sensitive
to this alarming development and increased the number of baseline and
ecological studies on the impact of humans on the biosphere and proposed
various strategies to alleviate the environmental and biotic crisis.
This has triggered vivid discussions about the potential risks and
benefits of measures such as adaptation and/or mitigation actions,
ecosystem restoration, the assisted migration of species or triage
conservation (Mooney, 2010).

One constant in these proposals is a sense of urgency, as the pace of
change seems to outstrip our capacity to react to it. There are various
crucial issues that limit said capacity: the incomplete inventory of
biodiversity---we still do not know how many and which species live on
Earth; our deficiency in understanding the relationships between
biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; and the inertia of the planet
itself---even if we immediately stopped using fossil fuels and reduced
CO2 emissions, global climate change would continue for decades or even
centuries (Matthews & Weaver, 2010). Finally, but maybe most damaging,
our social and economic systems are too recalcitrant to even
acknowledge, let alone abandon or reduce their destructive practices.

...our social and economic systems are too recalcitrant to even
acknowledge, let alone abandon or reduce their destructive practices

A [popular remedy]{.underline} for the deterioration of nature [is
**'sustainability\'**]{.underline}---commonly defined as meeting "the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs" (WCDE, 1987)---[which would
harmonize human development and the conservation of natur]{.underline}e.
This classical notion of sustainable development argues inexplicitly for
caring for our natural environment, because it is the primary provider
of resources to sustain human life. Elkington (2002) introduced a social
element to this by recognizing that sustainable development involves
"the simultaneous pursuit of economic prosperity, environmental quality
and social equity". Baumgärtner & Quaas (2010) define sustainability as
"a matter of justice at three levels: between humans of the same
generation, between humans of different generations, and between humans
and nature". Many other forms, definitions and interpretations of
sustainability exist---strong, weak, technological, economical, social,
environmental, ecological, and so on---but, in all cases, the ultimate
objective of sustainability is to preserve biodiversity and ecological
functions for the benefit of present and future human generations. In
short, our concern for nature is essentially anthropocentric (Rull,
2010a).

The [concept of sustainability]{.underline} has [become the **paradigm**
for conservation and environmental studies]{.underline}, to the extent
that many consumer products, technologies and [developments]{.underline}
now [**claim** to be **'sustainable\'**,]{.underline} whatever that
means. The same [happens at the popular level]{.underline}, as the term
'sustainable\' is often considered a synonym of good whereas
'unsustainable\' is used in a pejorative sense for what is considered
intrinsically bad. Curiously, these notions are widespread in different
societal sectors---politicians, economists, scientists, journalists, the
general public---independent of their social condition and political and
economic orientation. The terms 'sustainable\' and 'sustainability\' are
in danger of losing their original meaning to become merely rhetorical
elements or advertising slogans.

Our [understanding and definition of]{.underline} nature [conservation
is]{.underline} largely [guided by]{.underline} our concept of
['naturalness\']{.underline}. But [nature has **always** been in
**flux**;]{.underline} after billions of years of biological evolution
and ecological change---with and without human involvement---it is
impossible to define the 'natural\' state of the environment. In
addition, human actions have an impact on ecosystems; thus, the
maintenance of a pristine state of the Earth---however one would define
this---does not seem to be compatible with basic human needs.
[A]{.underline} more [practical approach to sustainability
and]{.underline} the [preservation of a 'natural\' state would be to
require]{.underline} that [any modifications of nature leave ecosystems
as **diverse** and **'healthy\'** as possible]{.underline}. More
pragmatically, the best we could hope to achieve, even from an
ecocentric point of view, is to [stop further **'spoiling\'** of
**nature**]{.underline} and preserve the current 'unnatural\' state.

Our understanding and definition of nature conservation is largely
guided by our concept of 'naturalness\'

Given this [**inherent conflict** between conservation and human
needs]{.underline}, conservation organizations struggle to propose
practices that "balance the needs of people with the needs of the planet
that supports us" (IUCN, http://www.iucn.org), or "protect Earth\'s most
important natural places for you and future generations" (The Nature
Conservancy, http://www.nature.org), in order to "build a future where
people live in harmony with nature" (WWF, http://www.wwf.org). In other
words, conservationists advocate sustainable development of human
societies, but their activities can only be palliative. Sustainability
will only be attained after drastic reorientation towards steady-state
or de-growth economic models (Lawn, 2010; Schneider et al, 2010), which
would involve profound changes not only for societies, but also for
every individual.Inline graphic

The [main obstacles]{.underline} to such broad socioeconomic change
towards sustainable development [are the high number of **environmental
problems** that clamour for attention]{.underline} (seeing trees but not
the forest) and the intransigence of social and economic systems. It is
naive to pretend that representatives of the dominant economic and
political systems will renounce capitalism; this has been repeatedly
demonstrated at Kyoto or Copenhagen, where the international community
was unable to agree on even small changes to slow global climate change.

Even worse, scientists and [conservationists could become **trapped** in
the very system that they are trying to change.]{.underline} A good
example of this risk comes from attempts to [assign **monetary value**
to biodiversity]{.underline} and ecosystem services [and use **market
rules**]{.underline} to manage them (Rull, 2010a). A simple economic
analysis is enough to demonstrate the [**fallacy** of this]{.underline}
economic [approach to sustainability]{.underline}, even from a pragmatic
perspective.

The appeal of this concept is that any ecosystem service could be
submitted to a cost--benefit analysis, that would incorporate natural
capital into current economic models. It also makes possible a general
definition of comprehensive wealth, which includes not only reproducible
capital such as buildings, machinery, roads and so on, but also natural
capital. In this context, sustainable development has been redefined as
'the accumulation of comprehensive wealth\', which requires that each
generation should bequeath the next one at least as large a productive
base, including both reproducible and natural capital, as it has
inherited (Dasgupta, 2010).

However, [submitting **natural resources** to economic analysis does
**not guarantee** **sustainable** practices]{.underline}. The first
thing to bear in mind is that [comprehensive wealth is **finite** and
limited by the **carrying capacity** of the Earth]{.underline}. If
certain planetary systems---such as **[climate]{.underline}**, **[ocean
acidity]{.underline}**, freshwater and
**[biodiversity]{.underline}**---change beyond a certain limit, it could
[trigger **nonlinear** and **catastrophic consequences** on a global
scale]{.underline} (Rokström et al, 2009). Second, the components of
comprehensive wealth depend on each other: for example, building a road
through a forest is done at the expense of the forest, that is, natural
capital. [Building the road might increase comprehensive wealth but it
has a **price**]{.underline}: **[natural degradation]{.underline}**,
including **[resource exhaustion]{.underline}**, **[loss of
biodiversity]{.underline}** and increased pollution. [If human growth
continues]{.underline}, [these costs could become **so high** that
systems]{.underline}---both ecological and
economic---**[collapse]{.underline}**. Sustainable practices could
therefore aim to minimize the loss of natural capital, but [if human
development **continues**]{.underline} unabated, the [**carrying
capacity** of the Earth will nonetheless be **reached** sooner or
later]{.underline}.

Rockström et al (2009) argue that humanity has already transgressed
three of nine critical planetary boundaries, namely climate change,
biodiversity loss and interference with the nitrogen cycle through
industrial and agricultural fixation of atmospheric nitrogen, the
combustion of fossil fuels and biomass and the pollution of waterways
and coastal zones. This means that nature is subsidizing the capitalist
mode of development. For a quantitative estimate of natural costs, the
LPI (Living Planet Index) of global diversity has declined by nearly 35%
in the past 30 years (WWF, 2008); hence, the cost during this period has
been about 1.2% of species per year.

Even if capitalism, as the dominant economic model, incorporates natural
capital into its cost--benefit analysis, [nature still **loses
out**]{.underline}; [unlimited **human growth**]{.underline}---the
central tenet of capitalism---[and **sustainable development** are
**incompatible**]{.underline} (Rull, 2010b). Some alternative modes of
human development exist (Costanza, 2009; Schneider et al, 2010), but
these also rely on sustainability.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Fusion\-\--2NC

#### Fusion is [impossible]{.underline} under capitalism.

**Angantyr 23** --- Lotta Angantyr, RCP national organiser, 2023
(\"Fusion Breakthroughs: How Capitalist Profiteering Impedes Clean,
Unlimited Energy - Revolutionary Communists of America\", *Revolutionary
Communists of America*, February 2^nd^, Available Online at
https://communistusa.org/fusion-breakthroughs-how-capitalist-profiteering-impedes-clean-unlimited-energy/,
Accessed 07-23-2025) rj

These breakthroughs have proven that fusion works. If [we do not
**already possess** this]{.underline} marvelous technology, it is
because [it has been]{.underline} criminally and systematically
[**deprived of funding** for decades]{.underline}.

In 1976, in the wake of the oil shock, the US Energy Research and
Development Administration undertook a serious assessment of the
prospects for developing commercially-viable fusion reactors based on
certain assumptions about research funding. Based upon maximum effort,
projections indicated that commercial viability would be achieved in
1990. Based on more moderate effort, 2005 would have been the turning
point. Based upon maintaining levels of spending as they were (about \$1
billion adjusted for inflation), it was thought that fusion might never
be achieved.

And yet only half of that annual sum has been invested. Annual US
government funding into fusion technology research has averaged a meagre
\$465 million from 2011 to 2021. Even that paltry amount only trickles
in thanks to the other tasks that the likes of the National Ignition
Facility are tasked with, such as maintaining the US government's
enormous stockpile of nuclear weapons. Clearly it is in spite of
starvation of funding that we've seen these recent advances.

So why has [research been **starved**?]{.underline} [Under
**capitalism**]{.underline}, [research investment does not take place on
the basis of **need**]{.underline}, [but on whether the **bosses** can
**cash in**]{.underline}. [Capitalists]{.underline} and their
governments [have **held back** funding for fusion energy research
because it makes **no business sense**]{.underline}. [Building and
testing]{.underline} prototype reactors [costs
**billions**]{.underline}, but should the [technology]{.underline} get
itself up and running, it [would promise to produce energy **cheaply**
and in abundance]{.underline}, [**squeezing the profits** of the
**entire** energy industry]{.underline}. As the former chair of the UK's
Atomic Energy Authority, Sir Walter Marshall would put it back in the
1980s:

There will come a time when we get as much energy from a fusion reactor
as we put in. Then there will come a time when we get more energy out
than we put in. However, [there will **never** come a time when we get
as **much money out** as we have **put in**]{.underline}.

The [capitalists are **disincentivized** from investing by the **massive
upfront costs**]{.underline}, [which they **weigh against** the
likelihood of very cheap energy thereafter]{.underline}. As Foreign
Policy economics columnist Adam Tooze said in the podcast Ones and
Tooze:

Our experience both at the level of economics and at the level of
politics with this particular set of technologies---those to do with
[nuclear power]{.underline}, [fission]{.underline}, [and
fusion]{.underline}---over the last 50 years has been sobering. And on
the whole, they appear at this point [to be both **massively unpopular
tech**nologies]{.underline} and, in some cases, [**hugely politicized**
technologies as well as **incredibly expensive** in terms of **capital
costs**]{.underline}---not in terms of operating them but in terms of
capital cost to build them. And so, a realistic energy strategy that
addresses a crisis where we need to make huge strides in the next 20 to
30 years should not rule those technologies out, but it should
realistically gauge how much contribution they can make. And in both
Europe and the United States, there is evidently a case for maintaining
the existing capacity, but it's pretty difficult to see what the case is
for investing in new capacity when the costs are as explosively
uneconomic.

The capitalists have other plans

Despite the past year's successes, many still argue that [fusion energy
is **unviable**]{.underline}, and that we are better off investing in
already existing renewable energy sources (although, not all of these
are as "green" as they are made out to be). But across the board, the
fact is that renewable energy is not as profitable as fossil fuels.

[ExxonMobil and Chevron]{.underline} are expected to have
[amassed]{.underline} almost [\$100 billion in profits]{.underline}
between them in 2022. The [needs of the planet are the **last thing** on
their agenda]{.underline}. Exxon's long-term energy outlook predicts
that [**demand** for oil will]{.underline} continue to
**[grow]{.underline}** until at least the end of 2040, and that by 2050
the world will be consuming millions more barrels per day than it does
today. They also predict that [natural **gas consumption** will grow by
nearly **50%**]{.underline} over the same period. As Chevron's chief
executive Mike Wirth put it, [fossil fuels will]{.underline} still
"**[run the world]{.underline}**... 20 years from now."

Europe's largest oil and gas companies---BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, and
Equinor---made more than £74 billion in pre-tax profits in the first six
months of 2022. The energy crisis is, naturally, making fossil fuels
even more profitable, and as such these four companies are of course
investing more in fossil fuels than renewables and low carbon energy.
BP, for instance, invested £3.8 billion in new oil and gas projects in
2022, compared to just £300 million in renewables and "low carbon"
energy.

And [governments are **backing the capitalists**]{.underline}. Since
2015, The UK government has [handed]{.underline} over £13.6 billion to
the [oil and gas industry in **subsidies**]{.underline}. Far from moving
towards clean energy, the UK government has recently proposed opening up
a coal mine in Cumbria, the first in 30 years.

The [capitalist class is]{.underline} literally [**toying** with our
future]{.underline}. The technology and other necessary means to fight
climate change are right there, at their fingertips. Yet all they have
in mind are their own profit margins. The money is there to invest in
fusion energy and, in short order, to make it a viable alternative for
our energy needs. The money is there to rapidly phase out fossil fuels
and replace them with already viable forms of renewable and clean
energy. But that money is in the pockets of companies like ExxonMobil
and Chevron.

If these [companies were]{.underline} to be [**expropriated** and put
under **democratic control**]{.underline} by the working class, [we
could use their **enormous resources** to **complete** the green
transition]{.underline} in a timescale that is being dictated to us by
the need [to **prevent** the collapse of our ecosystem]{.underline}.
[This is the **only option** if we are to successfully **transform** the
energy system to work for the **planet's needs**]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Hydropower\-\--2NC

#### Hydropower [fails]{.underline} and [intensifies]{.underline} warming.

**Klemm and Simonov 22** --- [Josh Klemm]{.underline}, co-executive
director of International Rivers, and [Eugene Simonov]{.underline},
international coordinator of the Rivers without Boundaries Coalition
(RwB), 2022 ("10 reasons why hydropower dams are a false climate
solution," *International Rivers*, April 6^th^, Available Online at
https://www.internationalrivers.org/news/10-reasons-why-hydropower-dams-are-a-false-climate-solution/,
Accessed 07-23-2025)

**\[\[\*\*\* Note: ~~bad~~ language \[edited\]. \*\*\*\]\]**

Not only does [hydroelectric power **fail**]{.underline} to prevent
catastrophic climate change, but it also [renders countries **more
vulnerable** to climate change while emitting significant amounts of
**methane**]{.underline}, [one of the **worst** **g**reen**h**ouse
**g**ase**s**]{.underline}.

A river is a spectacular living corridor that feeds forests, fisheries,
coastal ecosystems, and farmlands; transports life-sustaining organic
matter and nutrients; provides drinking water; fosters cultural
connection; and prevents carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. A
river supports staggeringly rich biodiversity. One major way we negate
rivers' many benefits is by building dams.

Once considered a renewable way to harness the power of rivers,
hydroelectric dams are now better known for their adverse impacts: They
destroy a river's biodiverse ecosystems, decimate the food security and
livelihoods of local communities, and produce harmful methane that
exacerbates climate change. Dams are costly to build, difficult to
maintain, and aren't climate-resilient or competitive against proven
clean energy alternatives like solar and wind power.

In 2000, following publication of the seminal World Commission on Dams
(WCD) report, many countries and financiers stopped proposing and
funding dams, but a remaining few are now using climate change as a
pretext to save the declining industry, and calling for scarce climate
dollars to be used to keep the industry afloat. Projects are now being
pushed in arguably the worst places to build a dam: on rivers flowing
through biodiversity hotspots and protected areas in the tropics. With
vested interests calling for the doubling of existing hydropower
capacity in the coming decades, here are 10 key reasons why dams are a
false solution to the climate crisis.

1\. [Climate Change Is Making Dams **Unreliable** and
**Risky**]{.underline}

[Large hydropower]{.underline} projects are particularly [**vulnerable**
to the impacts of climate change]{.underline}. [Droughts]{.underline}
have ~~crippled~~ [\[**destroyed**\] hydropower generation all over the
world,]{.underline} [leading to **energy rationing** and
**blackouts**]{.underline} from the U.S. to China, and from Brazil to
southern Africa. This [trend is only **expected to increase**
in]{.underline} the current changing climate scenario being witnessed
globally. Meanwhile, increasingly common extreme weather events make
large dams dangerous for people living downstream, as they become
vulnerable to dam failures.

2\. [Dams Produce **Significant Amounts** of **Methane**]{.underline}

At least [**25 percent** of today's global warming is caused by
**methane emissions**]{.underline}, which have "[more than **80
times**]{.underline} the warming [power of carbon dioxide]{.underline}
over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere," according to a
press release from the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). As the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2021 showed,
[cutting methane emissions is the most urgent step]{.underline} we must
take [to]{.underline} immediately **[slow]{.underline}** the rate of
global [warming]{.underline}, an observation also made in Nature. Dams
generate methane and carbon dioxide when vegetation and organic matter
are flooded in the reservoirs and start to decay underwater, as well as
when areas are deforested to make way for building the project. [Dam
reservoirs represent a **significant source** of methane
globally]{.underline}, [equivalent to]{.underline} the **[greenhouse gas
footprint]{.underline}** [of **Canada**]{.underline}, and scientists
have found in some cases that dam reservoirs can cause more warming than
coal-fired power plants.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: AI\-\--2NC

In addition to more nuanced modeling and use cases for **[[AI

of the [[environmental impact]{.mark}s]{.underline}
**[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}** their LLM [[research and

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Geoengineering\-\--2NC

#### 'Geoengineering' is [speculative]{.underline} and hasn't been [scaled up]{.underline}, but it's also [bad]{.underline}.

[[Geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} not only fails to address the root
causes of the climate crisis but risks
**[[accelerat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[ecosystem
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}** and species extinction. It could also
severely compromise our ability to bring the biosphere back to a state
where it can better regulate climate conditions and provide vital
ecosystem functions. • Geoengineering [[tech]{.mark}nologies, [if
deployed at scale]{.mark}]{.underline}, could have profound,
**[[unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and potentially [[irreversible
effect]{.mark}s [on biod]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}, both through
their direct impacts and as a result of compounding and exacerbating
existing planetary crises caused by pollution, climate change, and
**[[unsustainable land use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. • If deployed at
scale, geoengineering technologies would likely cause a range of harmful
impacts, including **[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
[[precipitation]{.mark}, [uneven cooling]{.mark}, and [oxygen
depletion]{.mark}, as well as [degrade nutrient cycling]{.mark},
[weaken]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[ozone]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
disrupt food webs with significant deleterious impacts on biodiversity

### Sustainability\-\--AT: ESGs\-\--2NC

this is that we have seen these investment schemes before. In the late

die]{.underline}]{.mark}**d. The same occured in 2021 as investors who
wanted to "feel good" about owning "disruptive" companies. That
speculative demand changed quickly when performance failed. RBC Wealth
Management surveyed over 900 US-based clients recently. 49% said that
performance and returns were a higher priority than ESG impact, up from
42% in 2021. "The story told is you don't have to give up returns in
order to do ESG. But everyone assumed that you would get the same exact
return profile as a traditional benchmark. Which is absolutely not true
because traditional benchmarks are not looking at ESG factors." -- Kent
McClanahan, VP Responsible Investing at RBC. RBC clients also expressed
skepticism about the ESG label[. [74%]{.mark} of those surveyed said
many [companies]{.mark} provide [misleading info]{.mark}rmation
[about]{.mark} their [ESG]{.mark}]{.underline} initiatives. "Investment
managers and banks are taking advantage of our collective willingness to
help fight climate change because the ESG space is, to put it mildly, a
zoo. Epic greenwashing is everywhere: Out of 253 funds that switched to
an ESG focus in 2020 in the US, 87 percent of them rebranded by adding
words such as 'sustainable' or "ESG" or 'green' or 'climate' to their
names. None changed their stock or bond holdings at that point." -- The
Great Wall Street Heist Unfortunately, changing your name doesn't change
your performance. As RBC noted, performance is all that ultimately
matters to investors. However, ESG was a **[[profoundly flawed
premise]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the first place. Deeply Flawed Premise
One of the most significant problems with ESG is that by applying
un-measurable factors on companies, such inevitably leads to poor
decisions. **[[Environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** or social
**[[issues]{.underline}]{.mark}** may sound great as a talking point but
delivering on those goals can be **[[extremely
costly.]{.underline}]{.mark}** "Why are ESG funds doing so badly? Part
of the explanation may simply be that an express focus on ESG is
redundant: in competitive labor markets and product markets, corporate
managers trying to maximize long-term shareholder value should of their
own accord pay attention to employee, customer, community, and
environmental interests. On this basis, setting ESG targets may actually
distort decision making. There's also some evidence that companies
publicly embrace **[[ESG]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a **[[cover for poor
business performance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recent paper by Ryan
Flugum of the University of Northern Iowa and Matthew Souther of the
University of South Carolina reported that when managers underperformed
the earnings expectations (set by analysts following their company),
they often publicly talked about their focus on ESG. But when they
exceeded earnings expectations, they made few, if any, public statements
related to ESG. Hence, sustainable fund managers who direct their
investments to companies publicly embracing ESG principles may be
over-investing in financially underperforming companies." -- Harvard
Business Review In other words, **[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark}**
will **[[focus on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the issues that make them most
**[[productive in]{.underline}]{.mark}** a competitive, **[[capitalistic
environment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, when companies are forced
to make decisions based on meeting some phantom goal or agenda, those
choices may not be in the company's best interest. We have seen recent
evidence of blowback from these choices in companies like
Anheuser-Busch, Target, and others. However, while these individual
companies have faced backlash by offending large portions of their
customer base, it is potentially not entirely their fault. Blackrock
manages over \$10 Trillion in assets and has infiltrated itself just
about every corner of the financial realm. Given their massive financial
presence, they have large stakes in these companies pushing Blackrock's
ESG agenda. The question is, why would they do that? Larry Fink, the CEO
of Blackrock, can answer that best.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: SDGs\-\--2NC

#### SDGs are [failing]{.underline}. 

**UNESCO '23** \["Climate Change Undermines Nearly All Sustainable
Development Goals." Unesco.org, 2023,
www.ioc.unesco.org/en/articles/climate-change-undermines-nearly-all-sustainable-development-goals.\]//neev

This undermines global efforts to tackle hunger, poverty and ill-health,
improve access to clean water and energy and many other aspects of
sustainable development, according to a new multi-agency report
coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Only 15% of
the Sustainable Development Goals (**[[SDGs) on
track]{.underline}]{.mark}**, says the United in Science report, which
makes a systematic examination of the impact of climate change and
extreme weather on the goals. It illustrates how weather, climate and
water-related sciences can advance aims such as food and water security,
clean energy, better health, sustainable oceans and resilient cities.
The annual report combines input and expertise from 18 organizations. It
is issued ahead of the SDG Summit and Climate Ambition Summit at the
United Nations General Assembly. "2023 has shown all too clearly that
climate change is here. [**[Record temperatures]{.mark} are
[scorching]{.mark} the [land]{.mark} and heating the sea, as extreme
weather causes** [havoc around]{.mark} the [globe.]{.mark} While we know
this is just the beginning, the global response is falling far short.
Meanwhile, halfway to the [2030 deadline for]{.mark} **the Sustainable
Development Goals (**[SDGs]{.mark}), the [world]{.mark} is [woefully
off-track]{.mark}]{.underline}," says UN Secretary-General António
Guterres. "Science is central to solutions. It is widely understood that
weather, climate, and water-related sciences provide the underpinnings
for climate action. But it is less recognized how these sciences can
supercharge progress on the SDGs across the board," Mr Guterres writes
in the foreword. "At this pivotal moment in history, the halfway mark to
achieving the SDGs, the science community stands united in the effort to
achieve prosperity for people and the planet," says WMO
Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas. "Groundbreaking scientific and
technological advances, such as high-resolution climate modelling,
artificial intelligence and nowcasting, can catalyze transformation to
achieve the SDGs. And achieving Early Warnings for All by 2027 will not
only save lives and livelihoods but also help safeguard sustainable
development," he comments. The report shows, for example, how weather
predictions help boost food production and move closer to zero hunger.
Integrating epidemiology and climate information helps understand and
anticipate those diseases sensitive to climate. And early-warning
systems help to reduce poverty by giving people the chance to prepare
and limit the impact. The need for science and solutions is more urgent
than ever. Between 1970 and 2021, there were nearly 12 000 reported
disasters from weather, climate and water extremes, causing over 2
million deaths and US\$ 4.3 trillion in economic losses. Over 90% of
these reported deaths and 60% of economic losses occurred in developing
economies, undermining sustainable development. Rising global
temperatures have been accompanied by more extreme weather. The chance
of the annual mean global near-surface temperature temporarily exceeding
1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five
years is 66% and is increasing with time. So far, there has been very
limited progress in reducing the emissions gap for 2030 -- the gap
between the emissions reductions promised by countries and the emissions
reductions needed to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris
Agreement. **[[Fossil fuel]{.mark} CO2 emissions [increase]{.mark}d 1%
globally in 2022 compared to 2021 and preliminary estimates from
January-June 2023 show a further 0.3% rise. To get on track to meet the
Paris Agreement goals of limiting warming to well below 2 °C and
preferably 1.5 °C, [g]{.mark}lobal [g]{.mark}reenhouse [g]{.mark}as
[e]{.mark}missions [must]{.mark} be [reduce]{.mark}d by 30% and
[45%,]{.mark}]{.underline}** respectively, by 2030, with carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions getting close to net zero by 2050. This will require
large-scale, rapid and systemic transformations. Some future changes in
climate are unavoidable, and potentially irreversible, but every
fraction of a degree and ton of CO2 matters to limit global warming and
achieve the SDGs, says the report. \"The science continues to show that
**[[we are not doing enough]{.mark}]{.underline}** to lower emissions
and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement - as the world prepares for
the first global stocktake at COP28, we must increase our ambition and
action, and we must all do the real work to transform our economies
through a just transition to a sustainable future for people and
planet,\" said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment
Programme.

#### Capitalism [drives]{.underline} terrorism

Capitalism and the Roots of Anti-American Terrorism." Journal of Peace

[Anti-American terrorism is an important subset of transnational
terrorist activity]{.underline}.1 As shown in Figure 1, terrorism
directed against US interests was a constant threat between 1970 and
2007.2 During this time period the [USA was the [target of terrorist
groups]{.mark} with [various ideological profiles]{.mark} hailing from
both Western countries and the developing world]{.underline}. For
instance, US interests were attacked by the left-wing German Red Army
Faction (RAF), the Philippine Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the
nationalist-separatist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(LaFree, Yang & Crenshaw, 2009). Shortly after the attacks of 11
September 2001 (9/11), US President George W Bush (2001 ) asked: \'Why
do they \[i.e. the terrorists\] hate us?\' This questions is also at the
heart of several academic contributions examining the roots of
anti-American terrorism. These studies primarily link its genesis to US
foreign policy, that is, the overall politico-military dominance of the
USA in the international system (e.g. Volgy, Imwalle & Corntassel, 1997;
Sobek & Braithwaite, 2005) and the involvement of the USA in external
conflicts, be it through military aid or interven-tions (e.g. Pape,
2003; Neumayer & Plümper, 2011). In this contribution we study [another
possible [source]{.mark} of anti-American terrorism, the [rise of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [opposition to capitalism is a
[cornerstone of]{.mark} many [ideologies that have]{.mark} spawned
**[terrorist movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The anticapitalist
[nature]{.mark} of left-wing terrorism [seems **self-evident**]{.mark}.
For instance, Varon (2004: 72) describes the [motivations of left-wing
militancy]{.mark} in the USA and Germany as follows: \'Under the banner
of \"[revolutionary **anti-imperialism**]{.mark},\" Weatherman and the
RAF assumed [militant roles]{.mark} in an international movement
[oppos]{.mark}ing the [U.S. power and capitalism]{.mark}
generally.\']{.underline} This already hints at the [[close connection
between **anticapitalism and anti-Americanism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
which is due to the widespread perception of the USA as the \'epitome of
mar-ket civilization\' (Mousseau, 2002:6). For instance, analyz-ing a
survey on anti-Americanism conducted in France in 2002, Grunberg (2005:
66-67) comes to the following conclusion: \'Traditional anti-Americanism
is primarily anticapitalism \[.. . \] [The United States stands at the
heart of the capitalist system, as the prime agent of globalization and
its foremost beneficiary.\']{.underline} Importantly, a[nticapitalism is
not only associated with left-wing but [also
**nationalist-separatist**]{.mark}, [anticolonialist, and
religious]{.mark}, especially Islamist, terrorist activity directed
against the USA.]{.underline} Here, the most prominent example is the
9/11 attacks on the New York World Trade Center, an icon of US economic
strength, making the [attacks [loaded with **anticapitalist
symbolism**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further examples are low profile,
recurring attacks in foreign countries on other symbols of US-style
capitalism such as subsidiaries of US fast food chains and banks. Here,
anticapitalist rhetoric is used to vindicate anti-American violence. For
instance, Osama bin Laden explained his fight against the USA in a 2003
statement (BBC, 2003) as follows: \'They \[i.e. the American soldiers\]
only fight for capitalists, usury takers and the merchants of arms and
oil, including the gang of crime at the White House.\' The discussion so
far suggests that [hostility towards USA may also - in addition to US
foreign policy - originate from opposition to capitalist
development]{.underline}. Motivated by this, in this contribution we
provide an [**[empirical examination]{.mark}** of the potential nexus
between capitalism and anti-American terrorism]{.underline}. In Section
2 we derive hypotheses from two theoretical frameworks (economic
openness theory and economic norms theory) that consider such a nexus.
Both frameworks contrast the pacifying effects of higher levels of
capitalist development (level-effects) with the potentially
destabilizing effects of a transition towards capitalism
(rate-of-change-effects), but differ with respect to their understanding
of what constitutes \'capitalism\', how \'capitalism\' may produce
pacifying and destabilizing effects, how \'capitalism\' can be
operationalized in empirical analyses, and how, ultimately, policymakers
can harness the beneficial and contain the inflammatory effects of
capitalism\'. In Section 3 we describe the variables and methodology
used to statistically examine the hypotheses developed in Section 2,
employing country level panel data for 149 countries between 1970 and
2007. Section 4 discusses our findings. Section 5 pro- vides further
time-series evidence, where we analyze the relationship between
capitalism and anti-American terrorism on the system-level. Section 6
concludes.

The Challenge: [Multiple **Existential** Threats]{.underline}

The [relationship between **[pandemics]{.mark}** and
**war**]{.underline} is as long as human history. Past pandemics have
set the scene for wars by [[weakening
**societies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [undermining
**resilience**]{.underline}, [and [exacerbating]{.mark} **civil** and
**inter-state [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Other [disease outbreaks
have erupted during wars]{.underline}, in part [due to the appalling
public health and battlefield conditions resulting from
war]{.underline}, in turn [**sowing the seeds** for **new
conflicts**]{.underline}. In the post-Cold War era, pandemics have
[[spread with]{.mark} **unprecedented [speed]{.mark}** due
to]{.underline} increased mobility created by
**[globalization]{.underline}**, especially between urbanized areas.
Although there are positive signs that scientific advances and rapid
innovation can help us manage pandemics, it is likely that deadly
infectious viruses will be a challenge for years to come.

The COVID-19 is the most demonic pandemic threat in modern history. It
has erupted at a juncture of other existential global threats, most
importantly, accelerating climate change and resurgent nuclear
threat-making. The most important issue, therefore, is how the
coronavirus (and **[future pandemics]{.underline}**) will
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} or decrease [the
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline} associated [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} these
twin threats, climate change effects, and the next use of
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** in war.Footnote5

Today, the nine [nuclear weapons arsenals]{.underline} not only can
[**[annihilate]{.mark}** hundreds of cities]{.underline}, but also cause
nuclear winter and [mass starvation of]{.underline} a billion or more
people, if not [[the]{.mark} **entire human
[species]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Concurrently, climate change is
enveloping the planet with more frequent and intense storms,
accelerating sea level rise, and advancing rapid ecological change,
expressed in unprecedented forest fires across the world. Already
stretched to a breaking point in many countries, the current
[pandemic]{.underline} may **[overcome resilience]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} the point of near or actual [**[collapse]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} social, economic, and political
[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In this extraordinary moment, it is timely to reflect on the [existence
and possible uses of **w**eapons of **m**ass **d**estruction under
**[pandemic]{.mark} conditions**]{.underline} -- most importantly,
[nuclear weapons]{.underline}, but also [chemical and biological
weapons]{.underline}. Moments of extreme crisis and vulnerability can
[[prompt]{.mark} **aggressive** and **counterintuitive**
[actions]{.mark} that]{.underline} in turn may [**[destabilize]{.mark}**
already precariously balanced [threat systems]{.mark}]{.underline},
[underpinned by conventional and nuclear weapons]{.underline}, as well
as the [threat of weaponized chemical and biological
technologies]{.underline}. Consequently, the [[risk
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of weapons of mass destruction
(**[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}**), especially nuclear weapons,
**[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark}** at such times, [possibly
**[sharply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--Inequality\-\--2NC

#### Inequality causes [extinction]{.underline}.

To assess the long-term effects of domestic income inequality in
developed countries, we assume a zero discount rate. Our contention is
that [**[inequality reduction]{.mark}** is more likely to
**[decrease]{.mark}** rather than increase **[existential
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our somewhat preliminary conclusion is thus
that longtermists should favour inequality reduction.

We discuss several reasons for why inequality might have negative
effects and one reason why it might have positive effects. The negative
effects we discuss are climate change, the effect of inequality on
public institutions, conflict and polarisation, and differential
progress. The potential positive effect we discuss is that if inequality
lowers growth rates, and if growth increases existential risk, then
inequality could lower existential risk.

\(i\) Climate change

As we learned in Section 3, [**[inequality increases]{.mark}** a wealthy
country's [**carbon** **footprint**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a
problem. First, [**[climate change]{.mark}** itself is an **[existential
risk]{.mark}**,]{.underline} particularly given uncertainty around its
tail-end risks (Ord 2020, chaps. 4; 6). (Although, it is likely not the
greatest existential risk (Ord 2020, chap. 5).)

Second, climate change is likely what Ord calls a 'risk factor':
increasing or reducing climate change will likely affect the total
existential risk, even beyond the probability that climate change itself
will cause an existential catastrophe (Ord 2020, 152). For example,
increasing [temperatures and more extreme weather imply that the
**fight** **for** **scarce resources** such as sweet water will increase
over the next decades]{.underline} ("Global Peace Index 2019: Measuring
Peace in a Complex World" 2019). Furthermore, [deteriorating living
conditions might lead to **climate refugees** who, in part, will flee to
developed countries, which could lead to institutional
**destabilisation** and **conflict**.]{.underline}

Finally, beyond extinction risk, [climate change could put us on a
suboptimal]{.underline} (non-extinction) [trajectory: run**-away climate
change**]{.underline}, for example, might put us on a path we cannot
easily leave and which [necessitates]{.underline} **[continuous costly
adjustments]{.underline}**, such as adapting to repeated flooding and
adjusting agriculture to extreme weather irregularities. When
aggregating those negative effects across time, those might add up to
significant long-term costs.

\(ii\) Institutional quality and conflict

It is often argued that a country's [long-term performance depends to a
significant extent on the quality of its institutions, including its
political and legal institutions]{.underline} (Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson 2005). Economic research mostly focuses on explaining long-term
differences in growth rates. As seen above, some [researchers argue that
**high inequality** will reduce growth rates, among other things,
because it can w**orsen institutional quality**]{.underline}. However,
besides facilitating economic growth, public institutions have other
functions that matter from a long-term perspective. For example,
[disaster preparedness, education, public health, foreign policy,
science policy, and many other areas could influence long-term
trajectories]{.underline}. If such things go badly, they could increase
existential risk. Conversely, good institutions will help reduce
existential risk. For many existential risk reduction strategies likely
require public goods and collective action, which in turn require good
public institutions (among other reasons, because some such public goods
are unlikely to be provided by markets). So, it seems reasonable to
assume that, with most other societal goals, **[[good
institutions]{.mark} can help [deliver existential risk
reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Here is a cheesy analogy: targeted
actions like washing your hands regularly or getting a flu shot can
reduce your risk of dying from an infection. But you will also do well
investing in a strong immune system, as that is an 'all-purpose goods'
in lowering your risk of dying from any bacterium or virus. [Investing
in good institutions might similarly be an all-purpose-good: rather than
tackling individual sources of existential risk directly, we improve
conditions for tackling whatever existential risks may come our
way.]{.underline}

There are at least two reasons why higher inequality could decrease
institutional capacities for longtermist public goods.

First, [there is some direct evidence that]{.underline}, whatever the
causal pathway, [[**inequality** reduces **institutional
quality**]{.underline}]{.mark} (which in turn typically leads to more
inequality) (Chong and Gradstein 2007; Savoia, Easaw, and McKay 2010).

Second, [**high inequality** can [lead to **elite
capture**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Empirical work on studying political and
de facto legal power is difficult, yet [there is a growing consensus
that high levels of inequality can lead to elite capture and thereby
reduce the long-term quality of legal and political
institutions]{.underline} (Acemoglu and Robinson 2008; 2013; Bartels
2018; Bavel 2016; Chong and Gradstein 2007; Cummins and Rodriguez 2010;
Savoia, Easaw, and McKay 2010). Further, [if [institutions]{.mark} are
disproportionately geared [to]{.mark}wards **[elite interests]{.mark}**,
then they might be [**less likely** to]{.mark} be **[gear]{.mark}ed**
[to]{.mark}wards [positive **longterm
trajectories**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We might see more rent-seeking and
less investment in public goods. Moreover, if elite capture is strong
enough, such capture, and the potential inequality that comes with it,
can intensify going forward (Chong and Gradstein 2007).

Now, one might object and wonder whether elite interests and longtermist
interests will necessarily be misaligned. Could an enlightened elite not
even be more longtermist than a more democratic system? Here are two
potential arguments. First, wealthy donors fund a significant part of
research and direct action on existential risk and longtermism (the Open
Philanthropy Project, for example). Indirectly, inequality might thus
reduce existential risk through such funding. Second, rich people might
have a lower rate of pure time preference than less well-off people,
which would make them more naturally aligned with investing in long-term
causes.

In response to the first argument, remember we here focus on income
inequality reductions. Private funding only requires 'enough' wealth
inequality going forward, it need not require elite capture. And
reducing income inequality is unlikely to eradicate the required wealth
inequality and the existence of big donors. In response to the second
argument, we are somewhat sceptical that elite capture would translate a
lower impatience rate into longtermist strategies in policy. A
successful transmission would require influence to be systematic and
well-coordinated across time and, probably, across different elite
actors. Yet lobbying and elite influence must often capitalise on
shorter windows of opportunities, which makes well-coordinated
intertemporal, and positive longtermist, policy capture less likely.

Of course, such considerations are speculative. But, in any case, we
think that, on balance, there are stronger reasons to believe elite
capture would increase -- rather than decrease -- existential risk.
First, [elite capture often comes with rent seeking, which lowers
institutional quality]{.underline} (Chong and Gradstein 2007). [Second,
industries like oil, gas, weapons and others are often concentrated and
well organised in exerting influence in law and
legislation.]{.underline} Their interests and influence overall are
likely to be more short-term than longtermist. Third, recent decades
have seen a shift towards a stronger shareholder value orientation in
corporate governance. A common criticism of this shift is that it
incentivises more short-term decisions. Accordingly, [corporate
influence into public institutions will likely display short-termist
bias too]{.underline}. Finally, we can of course imagine that
'prolongtermist elite capture' could happen and gamble on that
possibility. However, if strong democratic and legal oversight and the
power to check elite influence is lost, we might struggle to reverse our
gamble.

Second, [**high inequality** is likely to reduce **social capital** and
**trust**]{.underline} (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002; Knack and Keefer
1997; Rothstein and Uslaner 2005). [Social capital and trust in public
institutions in turn are important for **effective** public **goods
provision**]{.underline} (Knack and Keefer 1997; Beugelsdijk, Groot, and
Schaik 2004). **[Effective public goods provision]{.underline}**, in
turn, is [important for]{.underline} (some) [effective measures to
reduce existential risk]{.underline} (and, more generally, to coordinate
towards more valuable long-term trajectories). Therefore, [high
**inequality** could **reduce** societies' **capacities** to effectively
**respond** to **large-scale challenges** like existential
risk.]{.underline}

Finally, some limited direct evidence suggests societies with [higher
social capital and lower inequality exhibit better preventive and
adaptive outcomes for environmental risks and can show greater
resilience to external shocks]{.underline} (Bavel and Curtis 2019; Kahn
2005). For example, Matthew Kahn provides some evidence that more equal
countries, when controlled for GDP, have significantly lower death rates
in natural catastrophes (Kahn 2005). [While smaller natural catastrophes
are different from global catastrophic risk scenarios, resilience in
such events might be somewhat indicative of societies' resilience to
catastrophic risks.]{.underline}

So, good social and institutional conditions could help reduce
existential risk. Consider next how, conversely, bad conditions might
increase existential [risk. A key driver of [existential risk]{.mark} is
conflict, both between and within nation-states]{.underline} (or what
(Ord 2020, 175--79) calls a 'risk factor'). [Conflicts and arms races
raise human-induced existential risks such as **[nuclear war]{.mark}**,
the outbreak of a **[bioengineered virus]{.mark}** or the launch of
**[misaligned]{.mark} [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**. Note
that an existential catastrophe could be set in motion either
purposefully or accidentally.]{.underline} **[Both are [more
likely]{.mark} [during conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**Nuclear
warheads**, **cyberweapons**, and **bioweapons** could all be used
purposefully to attack enemy states, leading to potential **global
escalation**]{.underline}. But as past nuclear incidents and close calls
during the Cold War show, arms races also increase the probability of
accidental catastrophes (Schlosser 2013).

Esteban and Schneider find that [formal and empirical evidence suggests
that political and social **[polarization]{.mark}** [increases]{.mark}
the **risk of violent [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both
intra-nationally and internationally (Esteban and Schneider 2008). If
[income [inequality increases polarization]{.mark}, **inequality** may
indirectly **drive existential** risk]{.underline}. Indeed, recent
evidence suggests that [income inequality can increase the degree of
polarization between groups of citizens.]{.underline} Bonica et al. find
that the degree of polarization within the US House of Representatives,
for example, is accurately tracked by domestic income inequality, with
correlation coefficients rising up to 0.95 depending on the chosen
time-period (Bonica et al. 2013, 105--8). Of course, correlation does
not imply causation and the correlation is likely at least partially the
result of reverse causation or a confounding variable. That [said, we
should assign a non-negligible credence to inequality partially causing
polarization]{.underline}. Moreover, inequality and polarisation might
also play some role in getting polarising and populist candidates
elected (Piketty 2018). In a preliminary analysis of US election data,
Darvas and Efstathiou find that more unequal states were more likely to
vote for Donald Trump, after controlling for variables such as income,
race and education (Darvas and Efstathiou 2016). Populist politicians --
like Trump, Bolsonaro and others -- are likely bad news for existential
risk reduction. They are less cooperative in delivering regional and
global public goods and typically prefer riskier, and more conflictual
and nationalistic policy styles.

The [[**link** between financial crises and]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[**deterioration** in]{.underline}]{.mark} democracy,
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** and security has been [[highlighted
by]{.mark} **several [studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As noted by
Matthias Goldmann, \'in recent years, [more and more
**[data]{.mark}**]{.underline} has become available which
[[reveals]{.mark} a **[correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between
sovereign debt crises and the outbreak of civil wars. 225 Thomas Piketty
and Branko Milanović have stressed the [[link between]{.mark}
**financial [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}, inequality [[and **social
collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 226 In addition to economic recession
and falling trade volumes, global economies are strongly affected by
chronic deflation. Historically, there is a correlation between
inflation-deflation cycles and the debt cycles: deflationary pressure
increases during peace years, and inflationary, during war years. 227
Writing for The Economist, Qian Liu has warned that the [next economic
crisis]{.underline} could [[cause a]{.underline}]{.mark} \'**[[global
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'.228 This is concerning, particularly
in the context of the current debate on a new \'cold war\' brewing

### Impact\-\--Warming\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism accelerates warming and induces widespread market failure.

[[Capitalism]{.mark}, like Antarctica and like the Amazon rainforest, is
[under]{.mark} **[threat of destruction]{.mark}** by [excessive levels
of]{.mark} CO2 [emission]{.mark} which cause radical climate
change]{.underline}. Risk of some level of extinction of capitalism goes
to the heart of a recent article written by Gunther Thallinger, Member
of the Board of Management of Allianz Group (est. 1889, Munich) the
world's largest insurance company: Climate, Risk, Insurance: The Future
of Capitalism d/d March 25, 2025. Mr. Thallinger's provocative article
starts by spelling out the relationship between CO2 emissions and "the
amount of energy" trapped in the atmosphere, which is one way of saying
"global warming trapped in the atmosphere," as he draws a direct link
between the two. Mr. Thallinger spells out the risks: "These extreme
weather phenomena drive [direct [physical risks to all]{.mark}
categories of [human-owned assets]{.mark}---land, houses, roads, power
lines, railways, ports, and factories. [Heat and water]{.mark}
**[destroy capital]{.mark}**. Flooded homes lose value. [Overheated
cities]{.mark} become [**uninhabitable**.]{.mark} [Entire asset
classes]{.mark} are [degrading]{.mark} in real time, which translates to
loss of value, business interruption, [and market devaluation]{.mark} on
a systemic level]{.underline}." If this is how a board member of the
world's largest insurance company views risks to capitalism's asset
structure, then the world's capitalist's chieftains should seriously
consider altering the destructive nature of climate change asap by
omitting CO2 emissions. Thallinger explains the risks to capitalism's
markets: "The insurance industry has historically managed these risks.
But we are fast approaching temperature levels 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C where
[[insurers]{.underline}]{.mark} will [no longer]{.mark} be able to
[offer coverage]{.mark} for many of these risks. The math breaks down:
the premiums required exceed what people or companies can pay. This is
already happening. Entire regions are becoming uninsurable." Risks of
Climate-induced Credit Crunch Accordingly, "This is not a one-off market
adjustment. This is a systemic risk [that [threatens]{.mark} the very
[foundation of]{.mark} the [financial sector]{.mark}. If insurance is no
longer available, other [financial services]{.mark} become
[unavailable]{.mark} too. A house that cannot be insured cannot be
mortgaged. [No bank]{.mark} will issue [loans]{.mark} for uninsurable
property. Credit **[markets freeze]{.mark}**." Thallinger goes on to
explain how excessive climate change damages capitalism to
**["climate-driven market failure."]{.mark}**]{.underline} Nothing could
be a weirder coincidence than capitalism self-destroying via the genesis
of industrialization powered by oil. Solutions to climate change are
difficult beyond halting fossil fuel emissions, full stop.

[The [Arctic]{.mark} is [heating]{.mark} up nearly [**four times**
faster than]{.mark} the [Earth]{.mark} as a whole, according to new
research. The findings are a reminder that the people, plants and
animals in polar regions are experiencing rapid, and
[disastrous]{.mark}, [climate change.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Scientists previously estimated that the Arctic is heating up about
twice as fast as the globe overall. [The new study finds that is a
[significant underestimate]{.mark} [of recent warming.]{.mark} In the
last 43 years, the region has warmed 3.8 times faster than the planet as
a whole, the authors find.]{.underline}

The study focuses on the period between 1979, when reliable satellite
measurements of global temperatures began, and 2021.

[\"The Arctic is [more **sensitive**]{.mark} to global warming than
previously thought,\"]{.underline} says Mika Rantanen of the Finnish
Meteorological Institute, who is one of the authors of the
study published in the journal *Communications Earth & Environment*.

There have been hints in recent years that the Arctic is heating up even
more quickly than computer models predicted. [Heat waves]{.mark} in the
far North have [driven wildfires]{.mark} and jaw-dropping [ice melt
in]{.mark} the [circumpolar region]{.mark} that includes Alaska, Arctic
Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia and Siberia.

\"This will probably be a bit of a surprise, but also kind of extra
motivation perhaps,\" says Richard Davy, a climate scientist at Nansen
Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Norway, who was not involved
in the new study. \"Things are moving faster than we could have expected
from the model projections.\"

There are many reasons why the Arctic is heating up more quickly than
other parts of the Earth. [[Changes in]{.mark} the [amount of]{.mark}
air [pollution]{.mark} coming from Europe and natural multi-decade
climate variations likely play a role. But [human-caused]{.mark} global
warming is the underlying reason that the Arctic, and the planet as a
whole, are heating up.]{.underline}

[[Loss of sea ice]{.mark} is one of the [clearest drivers]{.mark} of
Arctic warming.]{.underline} The Arctic Circle is mostly ocean, which
used to be frozen for most or all of the year. But permanent sea ice is
steadily shrinking, and seasonal ice is melting earlier in the year and
re-forming later.

Sponsor Message

[That means more open water. But while ice is bright and reflects heat
from the sun, [water is darker]{.mark} and [absorbs it]{.mark}. That
[heat]{.mark} helps [melt]{.mark} more [ice]{.mark}, which means more
water to trap more heat -- the [loop **feeds on itself**,]{.mark}
accelerating warming in the Arctic]{.underline}.

NASA YouTube

\"That\'s why the temperature trends are the highest \[in\] those areas
where the sea ice has declined most,\" explains Rantanen. [There are
[hotspots in]{.mark} the [Bering Sea]{.mark} over Northern Europe and
Siberia, which are [heating]{.mark} up about [**seven** times
faster]{.mark} than the global average]{.underline}, the study
estimates.

Rapid Arctic warming affects people living far from the Arctic circle.
For example, there is evidence that weather patterns are shifting across
the U.S. and Europe as sea ice melts, and many marine species migrate
between the tropics and the Arctic each year. \"What happens in the
Arctic doesn\'t just stay in the Arctic,\" says Davy.

The new research also finds that the advanced computer models that
scientists use to understand how the global climate is changing now, and
will change in the future, struggle to capture the relative speed of
Arctic warming. That suggests that future models may need to be adjusted
to better capture the realities of global warming in polar regions,
although this study did not tease apart what exactly is missing from
current models.

[\"The paper\'s finding that [climate models]{.mark} tend to
**[underestimate]{.mark}** the [warming ratio]{.mark} \[[between]{.mark}
the [Arctic and the Earth]{.mark} as a whole\] is really
interesting,\"]{.underline} says Kyle Armour, a climate scientist at the
University of Washington who was not involved in the new study.

[The [Arctic region]{.mark} is becoming increasingly integrated into
world affairs while the region is simultaneously experiencing the
[growing]{.mark} impacts of [climate change]{.mark} and
[enviro]{.mark}nmental [pollution]{.mark}, two of the world's major
'wicked' problems.]{.underline} Rapidly advancing climate change, and in
particular warming of, the Arctic region was largely discussed after the
launch of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Report in 2004 (ACIA,
2004), although scientifically at least, and even in some political
circles, the phenomenon has been known for seventy years or so, as
"climate change became a U.S. national security concern even before the
Cold War became hot" (Doel, 2009: 17[). Now the [IPCC]{.mark}
[reports]{.mark} that the [polar]{.mark} regions are experiencing
[climate change]{.mark} at [twice]{.mark} the [rate as]{.mark} the rest
of the [globe]{.mark}. In the summer of [2020]{.mark} Arctic [sea ice
extent]{.mark} was reported [fell to]{.mark} the [second-lowest]{.mark}
annual minimum [on record]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, the Arctic is considered and has been redefined, at least since
2004, [as a [**linchpin** of]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}, like a
canary in coal mine, as well as a laboratory or workshop for climate
change research supported by TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and
Indigenous know]{.underline}ledge. Furthermore, climate change, in
particular the Arctic as a victim of global warming, has become one of
the major ways of Arctic perception[. This is partly true and partly
paradoxical, as small island states in the [Indian Ocean]{.mark} and the
[Pacific]{.mark}, and low-level coastal areas of [developing

simply due to the [**global nature** of]{.mark} the climate

fallout is [[altering]{.mark} the [hydrology and water]{.mark} quality

### Impact\-\--Space Col\-\--2NC

#### Capitalist colonization of space causes extinction\-\--socialism is key to prevent it.

**Snow '23** \[Henry; August 6; Author of 'Control Science', Assistant
Professor at Colby College, Labor Historian"We Can't Leave Outer Space
to the Capitalists",

Space Capitalism Will Be a Nightmare

What does capitalism in space look like? [Its future is easy to predict
based on the past several **centuries** of **capitalism**]{.underline}.
People sent to man Elon Musk's moon base would be in a similar position
to the men aboard the British vessel Sea-Venture headed to Virginia in
1609. When a storm left them shipwrecked on uninhabited Bermuda, they
decided they preferred living there to the starvation and hierarchy of
Britain's first permanent colony in America. Only through a vicious
campaign of executions and repression were they forced back onto the
Virginia Company's colonization plan.

[Workers in space would be even more **dependent** on **supply lines**
in a naturally hostile environment]{.underline} than the Sea-Venture's
crew were in Bermuda. Musk could [**coerce workers** into
submission]{.underline} by sending his workers decade-stale memes
instead of food until they cringed or starved to death, whichever came
first. If this seems too spectacular --- hopefully starvation would lead
to backlash and regulatory response --- consider smaller-scale
alternatives, like kicking workers' family members out of
extraterrestrial company towns, consigning them to lives of loneliness.
Space expands both the mute compulsion of economic power and the
coercive capacity of violence that define capitalist political economy
on Earth.

[Capitalist **control of space** will **threaten** us here on **Earth**,
too]{.underline}. Economic and political instability are already sources
of profit, but this is at least somewhat constrained by the basic
proximity of elites to the rest of us. New Zealand panic bunkers aside,
the Peter Thiels of the world cannot fully escape living alongside the
working class. [They can **weaken** **nations** and poison
water]{.underline}, but they'd rather keep governments compliant and
functioning, at the very least to mitigate risk by rendering investment
climates predictable.

But space changes the game. In the medium term, [**space** will create
both an **escape hatch** and release valve for **capital**]{.underline}.
Thiel and Bezos can command their empires from the safety of their moon
bases, while market conditions propel desperate workers to staff them.
More speculatively, we can imagine subject populations, prisoners, and
political enemies deported to Martian oubliettes or lonely asteroids.
[Capitalists]{.underline} already [act like this --- moving to tax
havens, profiting from prisons --- and]{.underline} it is
[obvious]{.underline} that [they will **take advantage** of]{.underline}
the [further opportunities space presents for such
behavior.]{.underline}

To briefly jump into what might also seem an outlandish, but is a very
important, realm, we must also consider the militarization of space.
Already, [**space weapons** are a matter of interest]{.underline}. A
more [sustained]{.underline} [extraterrestrial industrial capacity
expands this to almost unimaginable possibilities]{.underline} even in
the short term. Consider kinetic bombardment, a proposed technology in
which objects with high mass, like tungsten rods, could be dropped at
orbital speeds onto the Earth, which results in incredible destructive
power. At upper feasible limits, these "rods from God" could approach
nuclear levels of destruction, without the lasting effects and with the
possibility of scaling up or down: kinetic [**bombardment** can
destroy]{.underline} cars as easily as [cities,]{.underline} which would
[make **deterrence** much more fragile if not impossible to
maintain.]{.underline} Imagine virtually [**invincible**, nearly
**undetectable**, and **infinitely powerful** drone
**weapons**.]{.underline}

Whether in the hands of generals or billionaires, [this would be a
weapon of **terrible power**. Expansion into]{.underline} the vastness
of [space]{.underline} would [make constraining]{.underline} the
[development of these]{.underline} and other [weapons]{.underline} much
more [difficult]{.underline} as well. In practice, of course, this is
not going to lead to a single Bond villain holding the world at
tungsten-rod point. The reality could be even worse: [numerous
**actors** doing exactly that, without the deterrent risks of nuclear
weapons. **War in space** imperils Earth.]{.underline}

Even putting aside prospective weapons and considering only existing
capabilities, space has vastly more material than Earth. This means that
a nation or corporation with serious space capabilities will have
profound material advantages, after moving beyond the precarious early
stages of space exploration. Beyond material considerations, **[space
expansion]{.underline}** also [presents enormous **diplomatic
risks**.]{.underline} It is not difficult to imagine how squabbles over
an asteroid mine or lunar base could [lead to unintended deaths and
spiraling escalation]{.underline} --- wars have started over far less.
[Space]{.underline}, in summary, [is a force multiplier for every kind
of **human conflict**, and the result will be some combination of
**subjugation** and **chaos**.]{.underline}

A Leftist Response

As grim as it all sounds, we are not defenseless against the space
capitalists. We have our own weapons. First, much of what I have
outlined is currently in violation of international treaties. This seems
like a flimsy reassurance, given that treaties are violated constantly,
but it does buy us time and provide opportunities for alliances.
[Capitalists will need to sort out the legal and **political
complications** of space before they can **weaponize** or **colonize**
it.]{.underline} Actors who might otherwise be hostile to many left
goals on Earth have shared interests here, and the nightmare scenario I
have outlined should be equally terrifying to them

That said, pessimism and fearmongering can become numbing, and alarmism
is a poor foundation on which to build a future, no matter how alarming
the alternatives are. Instead, alongside attention to the dangers of
capitalism in space, we can organize around a vision of space for the
people. Even our brief forays into space have produced an incredible
bounty in terms of research, and further experience and exploration
holds the possibility of untold realms of knowledge with which we can
improve the human condition. The vast resources of space, currently not
owned by anyone, can be used to improve conditions on Earth. Why tear up
soil full of life when we can tear into lifeless asteroids? And why
should capitalists, who have only made it this far on the backs of
workers and the state, be allowed to profit from this?

[Space offers the possibility for resource development, manufacturing,
and even habitation that do not harm Earth or the life on
it.]{.underline}

The impact of space on mining exemplifies its broader material
possibilities, which could be the foundation of a popular program for
space development. Proponents of degrowth rightly point out the finite
nature of resources on Earth. Space offers the possibility for resource
development, manufacturing, and even habitation that do not --- beyond
the serious costs required to initially develop a presence in space,
which are worth considering and minimizing --- harm Earth or the life on
it.

Those of us on the left tend to feel understandable revulsion at
capitalist greed and the extraction it demands. But [**production** and
**consumption** are not the exclusive province of capitalists, and we do
not need to moralize around resources in space]{.underline}. We might
find mines ugly and waste immoral on Earth, but the [asteroid belt has
no **exploited population** to steal mineral rights from]{.underline}
and no water to poison. At its most extreme[**, space development**
offers an end to scarcity, and with it the **economic coercion
capitalism** relies on. We can build a **new political
economy**,]{.underline} so long as we keep the old one from dominating
this new realm.

Practically achieving this begins with recognizing the need for a left
vision of space. As for what that vision looks like, some contours seem
already obvious. [**Nationalization** of existing space assets will be
**necessary**]{.underline} but not sufficient --- the state and the
market are overlapping institutions. Looking further ahead, the
cornerstones of capitalism, private property and individual contracts,
must not be the basis for life in space. [Building on existing laws and
norms **rejecting property** in space, we can construct
**public-ownership** structures beyond the horizon]{.underline} (and
hopefully then import them back to Earth). Rather than selling one's
labor on a market, labor in space could likewise be centered around
collective benefit. This is practical as well as moral. In the
precarious but infinite environment of space, cooperation rather than
competition may be competitively favored: [**socialist** communities may
be able to **survive** and **thrive** in a manner capitalist colonies
will not.]{.underline}

As loathsome as some of its most high-profile proponents have been, the
argument that humanity should expand beyond Earth is appealing for
another reason: it is a simple fact that Earth will eventually become
uninhabitable. "Longtermists" obsessed with the distant future have been
rightly skewered for prioritizing cosmic simulated minds over real
existing ones, but that does not mean we should not care about the far
future at all. Human community is the one part of our existence that
transcends death, and we should not accept an end to it. For the same
reasons that we advocate a sustainable presence on Earth, we should
prefer to sustain life, human and otherwise, in the universe more
broadly.

And while it's hardly a rallying cry, the possibilities of life beyond
Earth also demand leftist attention to space. Whether it impacts Europan
microbes or galactic civilizations, [**capitalism** will be at least as
**harmful** for life in space as it is for life here]{.underline}.
"Space colonization" has received well-deserved criticism as a paradigm.
The [alternative]{.underline}, though, [is]{.underline} not withdrawal
(which the Left simply does not have the power to compel anyway) but
[space solidarity]{.underline}: the creation of communities beyond Earth
that respect each other and any other life we might encounter, viewing
the rest of the universe not as a place to exploit, but as a home away
from home, worthy of respect along with its denizens.

[Capitalist]{.underline} space visions are houses on sand. Their [hope
is a lie]{.underline}, and their promised abundance [merely
**colonialist extraction**]{.underline}. Leftists can offer real hope
for a world of class justice and human dignity. To be clear, the pursuit
of this vision must be prioritized appropriately: we cannot sacrifice
Earth or its people for a space future. This again is exactly why we
must do our best to take the reins of space development, rather than
leave the rest of the universe to the rich.

### Turns Case\-\--Military Interventions\-\--2NC 

#### Capitalism is the [sole justification]{.underline} for Arctic military interventions.

[And those [European countries]{.mark} that **[seek]{.mark}** to get a
slice of the [Arctic, or defend]{.mark} the [slice]{.mark} they already
have, do not just need to massively increase defence spending. They
[need]{.mark} an [industry]{.mark} to back it up. It's not just US
shipbuilding that is in crisis]{.underline}. Whilst over 70 percent of
new shipbuilding orders in 2024 were made to Chinese companies, securing
a 55.7 percent global market share, Europe's market share has declined
to approximately 7 percent measured in so-called 'compensated gross
tonnage' (CGT) and about 16 percent by value.

[The reality is that the [weaker Arctic countries]{.mark} simply [aren't
powerful]{.mark} or competitive [enough to defend]{.mark} the
[position]{.mark} that they had in the past. Lenin remarked over 100
years ago that the epoch of imperialism meant that "the world is
completely divided up, so that in the future only redivision is
possible". The Arctic is [now being **redivided**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Swedish, Norwegian or Canadian politicians may complain all they like
about how Chinese research in the Arctic is "just a front for gathering
intelligence", whereas their research is done to "save the Polar bears".
[They can [claim]{.mark} all they like [that Xi]{.mark} Jinping,
[Putin]{.mark} or [Trump]{.mark} are [evil **imperialists**]{.mark} who
want to [plunder]{.mark} the [Arctic for]{.mark} its natural
[resources]{.mark}, whereas they are only in the Arctic to protect
glaciers or the interests of the Sami and Inuits. Never mind the long
[history of]{.mark} brutal [oppression]{.mark} by Canada [against
**Indigenous**]{.mark} people, or against the Inuits of Greenland by
Denmark, or the Sami by Sweden, Norway and Finland.]{.underline}

The truth is that [[all nations]{.mark} operating or seeking to operate
[in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} are in it for the same reason -- the
**[profits]{.mark}** that can be made [for]{.mark} their [national
**bourgeoisies** from]{.mark} the **[riches]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[that]{.mark} [the [climate crisis]{.mark} will [make available]{.mark}.
The Europeans and the Canadians are only whining because they are not
strong enough to counter the competition from the stronger imperialist
powers.]{.underline}

None of them have any interest whatsoever in the real interests of the
people or animals living in the Arctic, nor do they care about how the
increased commercial activity in the Arctic will speed up the climate
crisis. [The [**only way** to save]{.mark} the [Arctic from imperialist
plunder]{.mark} is to **[abolish capitalism]{.mark}** altogether
[by]{.mark} the [working class coming to power]{.mark}, in the Arctic
and beyond.]{.underline}

[Never before has the [threat of nuclear annihilation]{.mark} been as
great as it is today. The unbridled escalation of the **[wars
in]{.mark}** the **[Middle East and Ukraine]{.mark}** by the NATO powers
must be stopped. For months, Biden, Scholz and their allies have been
crossing one red line after another]{.underline}. They want to provoke a
reaction from Russia and Iran that will give them the pretext to
intervene in the two wars with their own troops, weapons and aircraft.
The same ruthlessness with which they are bombing Palestinian refugees
and sending Ukrainian soldiers to the slaughter today, will be seen
tomorrow when nuclear bombs rain down on Iranian and Russian cities
tomorrow. [The **[NATO]{.mark}** powers have [spent over 200
billion]{.mark} euros to [fuel]{.mark} their proxy [war]{.mark} against
[Russia]{.mark}, and every bomb that falls on Gaza and Lebanon bears the
inscription "Made in the USA." Now no one can seriously believe that
these wars are about defending democracy and freedom or protecting
Jewish lives. For over thirty years, the [US]{.mark} has been trying to
[compensate for]{.mark} its [declining]{.mark} weight in the world
[econ]{.mark}omy [through military]{.mark}]{.underline} force. That is
why it has intervened in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and numerous other
countries, reducing them to rubble. With the current wars in Ukraine and
the Middle East, it is continuing this campaign for world domination,
whose central target is the emerging economic power, [China. In US
military circles, the question is no longer if but when it will wage a
war against nuclear-armed China---the consequences of which threaten the
[destruction of humanity.]{.mark} Once again Germany, whose hands were
tied following two criminal world wars, is pursuing an imperialist war
policy again.]{.underline} With German reunification on October 3, 1990,
marked by celebrations today, Berlin returned to its former policy of
aggression. The German government is not a vassal of the US, but pursues
its own economic and geo-strategic agenda---including against the United
States. Germany is the second largest arms supplier to Ukraine, after
the US, and its largest financial backer. Eighty-three years after
Hitler's campaign of annihilation against the Soviet Union, German tanks
are once again rolling into Russia. Germany is also playing a key role
in the genocide in Gaza and the escalation of the war throughout the
entire region. To pay for the massive spending on rearmament, funds for
education, housing and health are being cut to the bone and
unprecedented social cutbacks carried out. At the same time, democratic
rights are under fire. Demonstrations and organisations are being banned
in order to suppress the enormous opposition to this war madness. This
is accompanied by a horrendous witch-hunting of refugees. Of all people,
the desperate human beings fleeing from NATO wars are being made
scapegoats for the hated pro-war policy. The extreme brutalisation of
foreign policy is not the product of the personal failings of individual
politicians, which can be corrected by pressure from the streets. [This
is already refuted by the fact that all the
**[capitalist]{.mark}**parties **[support]{.mark}** rearmament and
**[war]{.mark}** and every media outlet is broadcasting deafening war
propaganda. It is the **[deep international crisis]{.mark}** of
capitalism that is **[driving]{.mark}** the **[imperialist
powers]{.mark}** to war. Private ownership of the means of production
and the nation-state system, on which capitalism is based, are
incompatible with the international character of modern production,
which unites millions of workers around the world in a single social
process]{.underline}. [As was the case in the world wars of the 20th
century, the [hunt for profits, markets and raw material]{.mark}s by the
[big corporations]{.mark} and [banks]{.mark} can]{.underline} no [longer
be settled by peaceful methods. The [wars]{.mark} in the Middle East and
Ukraine are [part of]{.mark} a [global struggle for]{.mark} the
**[redivision of the world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For Berlin and
Washington, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the reintroduction
of capitalism was only the start. They want to break up Russia and gain
unrestricted control over its vast raw materials, the same aim pursued
by Hitler in the past. That is why NATO has continued to expand
eastward, until [Putin]{.underline} responded with a reactionary and
desperate **[attack]{.underline}** on **[Ukraine.]{.underline}** He
hoped this would force NATO to the negotiating table, but instead
achieved the opposite. [The [only way]{.mark} to stop the wars and
[avert catastrophe]{.mark} is to [mobilise]{.mark} the [international
working class]{.mark}---those who create all of society's wealth and are
hardest hit by war---[against cap]{.mark}italism.]{.underline} There is
a powerful objective basis for such a movement: all around the world,
protests and strikes are breaking out against mass layoffs and wage
cuts, increasingly escaping the paralysing influence of the trade
unions. The central task is to combine these struggles with the fight
against war. The organisers of Wednesday's demonstration reject this
perspective. Rather than building a movement against the government and
its pro-war policy, they want to cover up this policy or to direct it
somewhat differently. They limit themselves to placing toothless demands
on the government to stop supplying weapons to Israel and Ukraine and to
seek negotiations. This is equivalent to asking a wolf to become a
vegetarian. The Left Party, which is supporting the Berlin
demonstration, has repeatedly [[support]{.mark}ed [NATO]{.mark}'s [war
against Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline} In their call for Wednesday's
demonstration, they demand "respect for international law by all" and
the "withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine"---the stated goal of the
NATO intervention. A year ago, all members of the Left Party in the
Bundestag (parliament) voted in favour of the resolution that offered
Israel "every support," giving the green light for the genocide in Gaza
and demanding more aggressive action against Iran.

### Turns Case\-\--Trade\-\--2NC

#### Empirical [analysis]{.underline} shows capitalism makes [trade collapse inevitable]{.underline}. 

**Atkins '25** \[C.J. Atkins, Managing Editor of *People's World*,
journalist and Marxist political analyst focusing on U.S. politics,
labor, and capitalism; February 6 2025; *People's World*, "The End of
Globalization? Trump's Tariff War and the Battle for Capitalism's
Future,"
https://peoplesworld.org/article/the-end-of-globalization-trumps-tariff-war-and-the-battle-for-capitalisms-future/;
AA\]

[Their analysis showed that the [**pursuit** of]{.mark} both the
[resources needed for]{.mark} commodity [production and outlets]{.mark}
for the sale of those commodities compelled [capitalism]{.mark} to
constantly [expand]{.mark} outward [beyond]{.mark} the [bounds
of]{.mark} national [markets]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The two were writing at a time when the struggle among capitalists over
the question of **[[free trade vs. protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}**
dominated economic debates, a period when British capitalism was the
dominant force in the world but capital was split on the best trade
policy to pursue toward the colonies and rival economic powers.

Some capitalists relied on the home market for the production and
marketing of their goods; they wanted protective tariffs to shield them
from competition. Another section---particularly big manufacturing
capital---had grown so large that it needed overseas suppliers,
customers, and even labor to efficiently and profitably carry out
operations.

Workers were being pushed to pick a side. Marx and Engels, as leaders of
the international labor movement, refused to be drawn into the dichotomy
of the [competing **[factions]{.underline}** of]{.mark} the [ruling
class.]{.mark}

"We have no intention of defending protective tariffs any more than free
trade, but rather of criticizing both systems," Engels wrote at the
time. The two pointed out the hypocrisy involved in this "debate,"
saying that capitalists had no principles and blew with the wind
depending on what was profitable for them at any given time.

All [capitalists desired]{.mark} the [shelter of
**[protectionism]{.underline}**]{.mark} when their industries were in
their infancy---or when they came under the threat of increased
competition. In *The German Ideology*, the founders of scientific
socialism wrote:

"Manufacture \[meaning industrial capital\] was all the time sheltered
by protective duties in the home market, by [monopolies in]{.mark} the
[colonial market]{.mark}, and abroad as much as possible by differential
duties. [Manufacture]{.mark} could [not]{.mark} be [carried on without
protection]{.mark}, since, if the slightest change takes place in other
countries, it can lose its market and be ruined."

While they supported the protectionist efforts of colonies and
developing countries to build up their industries in the face of the
battering economic assaults of imperial powers, and though they
sympathized with and backed workers fighting displacement due to trade,
[Marx and Engels]{.mark} were always [skeptical of]{.mark} the
rationales given by the major capitalist states when they imposed
[tariffs]{.mark}. Engels called big power [protectionism "the worst of
all."]{.mark}

He emphasized that "those who advocate the protective system never fail
to push the well-being of the working class" as a supposed benefit of
their preferred policy. But intelligent workers, he said, "know very
well this is a vain delusion.... Whether protective tariffs or free
trade or a mixture of both, the worker will receive no bigger wage for
his labor than will just suffice for his scantiest maintenance."

Marx and Engels knew that, generally, no matter which policy prevailed
in the leading capitalist economies, it would be used to the advantage
of capital and the detriment of labor everywhere.

[They also knew that [tariffs]{.mark} were [a **self-escalating ladder**
of conflict between]{.mark} the [capitalists]{.mark} of competing
nations. ]{.underline}As Engels said[:]{.underline}

["Protection is at best an endless screw, and you never know when you
have done with it. By [protecting one industry]{.mark}, you directly or
indirectly hurt all others, and have therefore to protect them too. By
so doing, you again damage the industry that you first protected, and
have to compensate it; but this compensation reacts, as before, on all
other trades, and entitles them to redress, and so on *ad
infinitum*]{.underline}."

And in the case of extreme disputes over trade, later Marxists warned,
[economic warfare]{.mark} could be **[[superseded by actual
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**. V.I. Lenin said protectionism on the
part of big powers was reactionary in nature. It "retards the country's
economic development and serves not the interests of the entire
bourgeois class"---let alone the entire society---"but merely a handful
of all-powerful magnates."

The First World War, during which Lenin wrote his classic
book *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism*, was an
"annexationist, predatory war of plunder... a war for the division of
the world, for the partition and repartition of colonies and spheres of
influence of finance capital."

That war put a damper on the period of free trade and globalization that
had preceded it and heralded a return to protectionist tariffs. The
national economies of the victorious major imperial powers were
reoriented toward an intensification of core-periphery ties with their
colonial hinterlands and away from inter-imperial trade.

[In the case of the U.S., this was characterized too by a [revival of
**Manifest Destiny thinking**]{.mark}, an obsession with dominating all
of the Americas, and a [withdrawal from European trade]{.mark} and
[security]{.mark} entanglements. Defeated Germany's denial of colonies
and thus its demotion in the ranks of the world imperial powers would
become a major factor in German capitalists' turn toward fascism and
expansionism. The Great Depression only intensified such
trends.]{.underline}

### Turns Case\-\--Cyber\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism [increases]{.underline} the [systemic risk]{.underline} of cyberattacks.

There are [[three]{.mark} primary [principles of cybersecurity:
confidentiality, availability]{.mark}, and
[integrity]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schneier, 2018). Violations of
confidentiality include cases in which [[hackers]{.mark} are able to
[gain illegitimate access]{.mark} to [confidential
data]{.mark}]{.underline} (see the Sony, Target, Equifax, and Capital
One hacks), as well as when systems are not secured and encrypted so
that confidential data are unintentionally left on the internet open to
be accessed by others (see Facebook (ENISA, 2019: 66)). Availability is
the characteristic of a system in which its functionalities are
available to authorised parties when needed (Pfleeger, Pfleeger, and
Margulies, 2015). Integrity involves only authorised parties making
changes to a digital system. Integrity violations can involve
modifications of an existing data set, as well as modifications to the
functioning of software (Schneier, 2018).9 As argued above,
**[[surveillance capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its
**[[imperative to collect]{.underline}]{.mark}** likewise generate an
imperative to connect. These twin imperatives tend to [[massively
increase]{.mark} the [systemic risk ]{.mark}]{.underline}emerging from
digitally interconnected networks. This intensification of risk occurs
in two key ways. First, it increases the [[vulnerability of the digital
networks.]{.underline}]{.mark} Second, insofar as these digital networks
grow in importance and replace other modes of social provisioning,10
then [[society]{.mark} is more [dependent on and]{.mark} hence
[vulnerable to]{.mark} any **[digital network
failure]{.mark}**s]{.underline}. Processes associated with surveillance
capitalism, including the increasing Curran 5 dominance of social media
in social life, the growing reach of IoT and 'smart cities', and the
more general networked digitalisation of life, consequently mean that
[[breakdown]{.mark}s [in digital systems]{.mark} pose a key [threat to
'effective life'.]{.mark}]{.underline} The argument that the imperative
to collect and connect intensifies systemic risk is pursued below
through identifying key factors intensified by these dual imperatives
that also intensify systemic risk. However, before addressing these key
factors, a brief discussion of systemic risk and how it can inform the
analysis of cybersecurity is needed.

### Turns Case\-\--Democracy\-\--2NC

The blame game started before the election results had sunk in, with a
predictable focus on elitism, identity, and the losing candidate
herself. This cycle of recrimination will tear apart the Democratic
Party and render it even less fit for governing in the future. It also
will distract from the elephant in the room: capitalism. Democracy is in
a death spiral because it is subject to a socioeconomic regime that pits
everyone against everyone else, undermining the capacity for consensus
and collective decision-making. It is not the first time that capitalism
has upended democracy. A century ago, the effects of rapid
industrialization at the expense of individuals and their communities
fueled communism and fascism in Europe. Writing during World War II, the
economic historian Karl Polanyi traced the root cause of his era's
political upheavals to an economic system that subordinated society to
the market principle.2 Top of Form

The problem, according to Polanyi, started with the abolition of the
"poor laws" in England in the early nineteenth century. Uprooted,
landless masses had no choice but to migrate to cities, where they were
exploited as cheap labor in factories that consumed their lives and
those of their children. While this system undoubtedly generated
prosperity, it came at enormous costs to too many people. Without the
devastation brought by World War I, the backlash against it by the
masses might have taken much longer. The United States, which fought in
WWI but not on its own territory, largely avoided the backlash despite
the economic depression of the 1930s. Importantly, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's administration accomplished something that other countries
did not: It gave the American people enough economic security that they
could begin to envision a better future for themselves and their
families. [[This time is different]{.underline}]{.mark}, and not only in
the US. We live in a system that most politicians have declared to be
without alternative. In fact, they themselves have long surrendered
control of the system and lack the capacity or will to imagine a
different one. The late Fredric Jameson's aphorism that "it is easier to
imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism" has gained
renewed currency, and it is not hard to see why. Governments have very
little room for maneuver, lest they be punished by (utterly amoral)
financial markets. Long celebrated as a tool for disciplining
policymakers, [[financial globalization]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[placed]{.mark} the [fate of]{.mark}]{.underline} entire [[societies
in]{.mark} the [hands of investors]{.mark} who [care only about price
signals]{.mark} and are [oblivious to human needs.
]{.mark}]{.underline}Governments tied their own hands in the hope that
markets would deliver capital, goods, and jobs. Buying into the belief
that they should get out of the market's way, they opened their
countries to free capital flows, even as they supported the selective
legal coding of assets and intermediaries to benefit the well-heeled.
Later, they encouraged their central banks to bail out intermediaries
who threatened to bring down the entire financial system in yet another
crisis. Countries also adopted international treaties that gave
multinational corporations the power to sue host states for harming the
profitability of their investments, or for "unfair and inequitable"
treatment. With these cases overseen by an arbitral tribunal located
elsewhere, governments effectively disarmed their own courts and
undermined their own constitutions (whose provisions cannot be used as a
defense against violations of international treaties). Some countries
(Germany most prominently) went so far as to
**[[deny]{.underline}]{.mark}** future elected
**[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}** the option of
**[[raising]{.underline}]{.mark}** additional
**[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark}** finance, by enshrining balanced-budget
requirements in their constitutions. Others
**[[held]{.underline}]{.mark}** their **[[people on
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** short **[[leash]{.underline}]{.mark}** by
pursuing fiscal austerity, even as the rich thrived on yet another asset
boom supported by easy monetary policies. Like Odysseus, who had his
hands bound to the ship's mast to withstand the call of the sirens,
governments found ways to escape the call of the voters who had elected
them. [[Democratic]{.mark} self-[governance lost
credibility]{.mark}]{.underline} long before the rise of the
anti-democratic parties that now openly deride it. For his part, Polanyi
expected the war to be followed by another transformation that would put
society, and not markets, in control. The legal and institutional
mechanisms adopted to advance this goal did work initially, but powerful
private actors and their lawyers soon found ways to arbitrage around
them. Two decades after the war, what the University of Michigan's Greta
Krippner describes as the financialization of the American economy had
already taken off. Financial returns became the end to which all other
needs and aspirations were subordinated. While the collateral damage of
this process was widespread, the biggest blow was dealt to our capacity
for collective decision-making. Had communism and socialism not
collapsed at the very moment when [[financialization
unleashed]{.underline}]{.mark} its full force, many might have noticed
its [[corrosive effects on democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} much earlier.
Instead, capitalism was celebrated as the only game in town. As a
result, we did not witness the "end of history" that Francis Fukuyama
proclaimed when the Cold War wound down. We are condemned to relive it,
but whether as tragedy or farce remains to be seen.

### Turns Case\-\--Africa War\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism [destroys]{.underline} Africa and [breeds]{.underline} civil war. 

**Duffield and Stockton '24** \[Mark and Nicholas, Mark=Professor at

Sheep and the Crises in Somalia and Sudan." Review of African Political
Economy, vol. 51, no. 179, 1 Jan. 2024,
https://doi.org/10.62191/roape-2024-0001; AA\]

We present in outline an historically and empirically grounded
explanation for the post-colonial [[destruction of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the nation states of **[[Somalia and Sudan.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This
is combined with a forecast that the political de-development of the
Horn, and of the Sahel more generally, is [[spreading]{.mark} south
[into]{.mark} East and Central [Africa]{.mark} as [capitalism's]{.mark}
food [frontier]{.mark}, in the form of a moving [lawless]{.mark} zone of
[resource extraction.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is destroying livelihoods
and exhausting nature. Our starting point is Marx's argument that the
historical growth and the continuing development of capitalism is
facilitated through what he called 'primitive accumulation'. With regard
to the current situation in the Horn, there is a sorry historical
resonance with the violent proto-capitalist land clearances that took
place from the sixteenth century onward in England, Ireland and Scotland
and then in North America. While today, as in Darfur, this may be
classified as genocide, the principal purpose of land clearances is to
convert socially tilled soils and water resources used for autonomous
subsistence into pastures for intensive commercial livestock production,
which now in Somalia and Sudan amounts to nothing short of [['ecological
strip mining']{.underline}]{.mark}. Simultaneously, land clearances do
create 'free' labour by separating communities from their collective
means of production, but organised rural--urban migration is also
required for this secondary effect to be of benefit to distant
employers. It is to this task that the international aid system
seemingly devotes most of its efforts, thereby socialising the economic
costs of surviving land clearances through the allocation of official
and charitable relief. An important but ignored aspect of Marx's
understanding of primitive accumulation is that, put simply, while
always an internationalised and uneven process, continuous revolutions
in the political economy of food have been essential adjuncts of ongoing
capital accumulation. For the purpose of this debate, ecological strip
mining enables, for a finite period, the concentration of solar energy
and soil nutrients into livestock. As highly concentrated protein, meat
has lent itself to evolving forms of industrialisation, processing,
transport and storage. On a par with fossil fuel in terms of its
space-time characteristics, meat remains the food, par excellence, of
urbanisation and proletarianisation. Energy for mechanisation and
industrialisation was, and still is, dependent upon fossil fuels to
power machinery. Equally important, however, the powering of proletarian
labour invariably requires the concentrated and highly capitalised
nutrition provided by meat. As is now clear, global heating is being
driven by both. Ecological strip mining is the nutritional keystone of
global capitalism and it has taken on new forms as the planet has
urbanised. For example, [[destructive]{.mark}
fish-[farming,]{.mark}]{.underline} soya production in the Amazon basin,
palm oil in south-east Asia and, as we argue below, militarised
livestock production in the Horn of Africa. Behind such changes in the
political economy of food is the same history of [[dispossession, theft,
violence]{.underline}]{.mark} and, ultimately, the unsustainable
exploitation of soil fertility and ocean ecologies. Moreover, as
available long-term export/import data-sets tell us, the history of
militarised ranching in the Horn is inseparable from the urbanisation of
chronically food-insecure Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Linked by a
violent extractive economy which shows every sign of intensifying in the
present crisis, we argue that the Horn and Gulf are locked,
respectively, into a widening cycle of destructive immiseration and
phantasmagorical urbanism. **Capitalism and war** To say that liberalism
conceals the predation of capitalism and imperialism, while accurate,
tells us little about these categories. However, the effects of such
obfuscation become clear if we ask the question: *how does liberalism
understand and respond to wars and warlike violence?* There is a
predilection, albeit selective, to interpret raw violence in terms of
its transgression of human rights and the creation of humanitarian
disasters. Violence is thus understood in terms of its moral and social
effects. For example, as creating dilemmas that typically foreground
practical and political issues relating to rights, humanitarian need and
the responsibility to protect. To be clear, this contingent
'humanitarian default' is not a cosmopolitan blind spot with regard to
the possibility of other interpretations of violence. It is a
declaratory political position. War and warlike violence were intrinsic
to the historic emergence of capitalism's unnatural economy.
[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}'s long pre-history of slavery,
enclosure, indenture and proletarianisation was deeply etched in fire,
blood and tears. For capitalism, rather than being contingent,
[[violence is]{.mark} an [active]{.mark}]{.underline}, indeed essential,
economic relation. Since the 1970s, the Horn of
**[[Africa]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been gripped by end-to-end social
[[civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}s. The liberal default presents this
permanent war as an unbroken series of contingent humanitarian
disasters. The violent de-development of Somalia, and now Sudan, are
without question unalloyed tragedies. The humanitarian default, however,
obscures the active process within the chaos, displacement and suffering
we witness. They are but the epiphenomena of an extractive mercantile
capitalism that operates through permanent war. Being necessarily
international and market-seeking, it is this [[violent mode of
production]{.underline}]{.mark} that is
**[[driv]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing the political fragmentation,
de-development and [[state collapse of Somalia and
Sudan.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Alt\-\--Socialism\-\--1NC

#### The alternative is a [socialist society]{.underline} towards the prioritization of [human needs]{.underline}\-\--only [eliminating]{.underline} capitalist ideology solves. 

**SA '22** \[Socialist Alternative; 2022; "What Could a Socialist
Society Look Like?";

[In a socialist society the means of producing wealth would be
transferred from the hands of an unelected corporate elite]{.underline},
concerned only with making a profit, [to the democratic control of
ordinary working people]{.underline}. Society could then be planned to
meet the needs of the majority, not just a privileged few, and we could
[lay the basis for eliminating poverty, inequality, violence,
oppression, and environmental destruction.]{.underline} [Already
existing technology and wealth]{.underline} could be [used for the
benefit of]{.underline} the whole of [society in an environmentally
sustainable way and new]{.underline} wealth and [resources]{.underline}
could be [generated by eliminating]{.underline} the duplication and
[waste]{.underline} which exist under capitalism and through rational
planning[.]{.underline}

Despite the trappings of democracy, [under capitalism]{.underline}, real
[decision-making]{.underline} [about]{.underline} most of the [main
issues]{.underline} which affect our lives [resides]{.underline}
ultimately [with]{.underline} the [small minority]{.underline} who have
economic and social control. [Socialism]{.underline}, based on
democratic public ownership of the main businesses and financial
institutions, would [enable working-class people to have genuine control
over every aspect of their lives. Through democratically-elected
committees in the workplaces and communities it would be possible to
participate in the running of society at every level]{.underline}.

Economic Independence

[Socialism]{.underline} would dramatically transform the lives of all
women and those of working-class women in particular. The ending of
production for profit and its replacement with democratic collective
planning would [enable]{.underline} the [freeing-up of resources to
ensure that everybody had access to well-paid work, guaranteed health
care, a pension and cheap, quality housing]{.underline}. This would
[guarantee economic independence for women, bringing an end to poverty
and allowing women real choice in personal relationships.]{.underline}

A [planned economy]{.underline} would [invest in the provision of public
services]{.underline} such as childcare, eldercare, and facilities for
the disabled, relieving many of the burdens which individual families,
and women in particular, shoulder today. [Under capitalism, women are
constantly made to feel guilty]{.underline} -- guilty if they want to
stay at home and look after their children and are claiming state
benefits, guilty if they leave their children in order to go out to
work. The [provision of good quality, flexible,childcare and jobs with
flexible hours]{.underline} and a combination of part time work and
parental benefit -- all of which benefits children as well as parents --
would [remove]{.underline} that [guilt]{.underline} and offer parents
real choice.

Together with a drastic reduction in the number of hours that people
work, women's lives would be transformed. More free time would be
available for relationships, for enjoyment, and for training and
education, [allowing women to reach their full potential]{.underline} in
a way that is impossible for the majority under capitalism. It would
also [enable women to participate in the democratic decision-making and
running of society,]{.underline} whether in their workplace, local
community, or on a broader level.

Public Services

In capitalist society, housing is a huge problem for so many
working-class and young people. When relationships break down,
working-class women can face homelessness or a life in precarious
housing. Working-class men's relationships with their children also
often suffer because of the way in which the social welfare system is
geared around the "nuclear" family. Good quality, publicly-provided
housing, flexibly responsive to the needs of ordinary people, would
relieve the financial and other stresses which expensive or inadequate
housing place on individuals and personal relationships. It would mean
that when relationships come to an end, for whatever reason, neither
women, children, nor men would be disadvantaged. And once the nuclear
family was divested of its economic and social functions, people would
be free to form relationships and households however they choose.

[Under socialism]{.underline}, [service recipients]{.underline} would be
able to [participate]{.underline} democratically [in]{.underline} the
[running of all public services]{.underline}. A democratically-planned
and integrated transport system, for example, would [take into account
the needs of all users as well as the environment]{.underline}. Other
services, which are currently in the hands of [private
businesses]{.underline} and often only accessible to the rich, could be
[publicly provided and available to everyone.]{.underline} High-quality
public restaurants would enable everyone to eat out rather than prepare
meals at home, if that was what they wanted. Similarly, many household
chores could be mechanized or provided collectively. This would have
nothing in common with "domestic service" in the past. This already
happens to a certain extent under capitalism, but it is mainly the
wealthy who can afford cleaners, gardeners, interior decorators, etc.
New technological developments could relieve the monotony and grind of
many jobs, not just in the workplace but also in the home.

A Real Right to Choose

[A socialist health service would also have sufficient resources to
harness scientific and technological developments for the benefit of
everyone]{.underline}, as well as massively increasing investment in
preventative care. While this would benefit women's health in general,
it would also give real choice over when and whether to have children.

Although increased accessibility to contraception and abortion has
contributed to enormous changes in women's lives in many countries, a
"woman's right to choose" does not truly exist today. Contraception is
not always 100% safe, is not always accessible, and often brings risks
to women's health.

In a socialist society, the companies which produce contraceptives would
be taken into public ownership and integrated into the health system. By
withdrawing the profit motive, it would be possible to carry out
research into safer contraception, both in terms of its ability to
prevent pregnancy and its effect on women's health. Similarly, it would
be possible to carry out proper research into other issues associated
with reproduction, such as menstrual and menopausal problems, and
consequently develop safe remedies. The same goes for the pharmaceutical
and medical industry as a whole.. Whereas [now these industries are run
in the interest of profit]{.underline}, oftentimes focusing on
symptom-based treatment rather than cures, [a socialist health system
would be freed up from these restraints, allowing scientists and doctors
to advance their research and treatment in new directions]{.underline}.

This [[administration]{.mark} is]{.underline} of the rich, [by the

attacking workers. It is [[extremely **alarming**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [should be a **[call to arms]{.mark}** for working people
everywhere]{.underline}. But it is also an [**[acceleration]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} existing **systemic** problems baked into
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Democrats lost because they represent their billionaire patrons
while only paying lip service to the interests of workers. The party
leadership tried to maintain the status quo of deportations in the U.S.,
and arms and money for Israel. It perpetuated the lie of stability as
the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 

[There is no reforming capitalism]{.underline} [into a
kinder]{.underline}, gentler [version]{.underline}. It has [always
**preyed** on workers]{.underline} at home and abroad. The [**[profit

I have heard many people say the Democrats have to win in 2028. To that
I say, [Trump is not going]{.underline} [anywhere]{.underline} without a
fight. He is going to do everything he can to stay in office and out of
prison. Democrats and elections aren't going to prevent another Jan. 6
insurrection.

[No one is coming to save us]{.underline} working people. We have to
save ourselves. [We need an **independent**]{.underline}
[anti-capitalist]{.underline} [labor party of workers]{.underline}, for
workers, by workers. [No billionaires]{.underline}.

We need [a **united front** to fight like hell]{.underline}. [We

unite to fight back against what threatens us all.
[Solidarity]{.underline} with each other [is our best defense and best

[[Workers can organize]{.underline}]{.mark} our own [**democratic**

[We need a **[second American revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[There is no going back to]{.underline} [normal]{.underline} as

Democratic Planning

Who should make these decisions? Socialists often responded: "the
workers." In Volume III of Capital, Marx defines socialism as a society
of "the associated producers rationally regulating their interchange
(Stoffwechsel) with Nature." However, in Volume I of Capital, we find a
broader approach: [**socialism** is conceived as]{.underline} "[an
**association** of free]{.underline} ~~men~~
\[**[people]{.underline}**\], [working with the **means of
production**]{.underline} (gemeinschaftlichen) held in common." This is
a much more appropriate concept: production and consumption must be
organized rationally not only by the "producers" but also by consumers
and, in fact, the whole of society, the productive or "unproductive"
population: students, youth, women (and men) homemakers, retired
persons, etc.

In this sense, [society as a whole will be **free** to democratically
**choose** the productive lines]{.underline} to be promoted [and the
level of **resources** that should be **invested**]{.underline} in
education, health or culture. [The **prices** of goods]{.underline}
themselves would no longer respond to the law of supply and demand, but
[would be **determined**]{.underline} as much as possible [according to
**social**]{.underline}, political [and ecological
**criteria**]{.underline}.

Far from being "despotic" in itself, [democratic **planning**
is]{.underline} the exercise of the free decision-making of the whole of
society -- [a **necessary** exercise to **free** ourselves
from]{.underline} the alienating and reified "[economic
**laws**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "[iron **cages**]{.underline}"
[within capitalist]{.underline} and bureaucratic
[structures]{.underline}. [Democratic planning]{.underline} associated
with a reduction of working time [would be a considerable
**step**]{.underline} forward by humanity [toward]{.underline} what Marx
called "[the **realm** of **freedom**]{.underline}": the increase in
free time is in fact a condition for the participation of workers in
democratic discussion and management of the economy and society.

#### Democratic planning [resolves]{.underline} environmental issues through [accountability]{.underline}.

**Lowy '20** \[Michael; April 29; philosopher and sociologist, Ph.D.

In the capitalist system use value is only a means -- and often a device
-- subordinated to exchange value and profitability (this in fact
explains why there are so many products in our society without any
utility). [In a planned socialist economy]{.underline}, [the
**production** of goods and services **responds** only to the criterion
of **use value**]{.underline}, [which entails
**spectacular**]{.underline} economic, social and ecological
**[consequences]{.underline}**.

Of course, democratic planning concerns the major economic choices and
not the administration of local restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries,
small shops, craft businesses or services. Likewise, it is important to
emphasize that [planning does not **contradict** the self-management of
**workers** in their **production** units]{.underline}. Whereas the
decision to convert, for example, an automobile factory to bus or rail
vehicle production would be up to society as a whole; the internal
organization and operation of the factory would be managed
democratically by the workers themselves. There has been much debate
over the "centralized" or "decentralized" nature of planning, but the
important thing remains [**democratic control** of the plan at **all
levels**]{.underline} -- local, regional, national, continental and,
hopefully, global -- [since **ecological issues** such as climate
warming are **global**]{.underline} and can only be addressed at that
level. This proposal could be called "[comprehensive **democratic
planning**]{.underline}." Even at this level, it is planning which
[**contrasts** with]{.underline} what is often described as "**[central
planning]{.underline}**" [because]{.underline} economic and social
[**decisions** are not taken by any]{.underline} "[center]{.underline}"
[but]{.underline} democratically determined [**by** the
**populations**]{.underline} concerned.

There would, of course, be tensions and contradictions between
self-governing institutions and local democratic administrations and
other larger social groups. [**Negotiating mechanisms** can help
**resolve** many such conflicts]{.underline}, but in the final analysis,
it will be up to the larger groups involved, and only if they are in the
majority, to exercise their right to impose their opinions. To give an
example: a self-managed factory decides to dump its toxic waste in a
river. The population of an entire region is threatened by this
pollution. It may then, following a democratic debate, decide that the
production of this unit must be stopped until a satisfactory solution to
control its waste is found. Ideally, [in an **ecosocialist**
society]{.underline}, [the factory **workers** themselves will have
**sufficient** ecological **awareness** to avoid making decisions that
are dangerous for the environment]{.underline} and the health of the
local population. However, the fact of introducing methods to guarantee
the decision-making power of the population to defend the most general
interests, as in the previous example, does not mean that questions
concerning internal management should not be submitted to the citizens
at the level of the factory, school, neighborhood, hospital or village.

Ecosocialist [**planning** must be based on a **democratic** and
pluralist **debate**]{.underline}, at each level of decision. Organized
in the form of parties, platforms or any other political movement, [the
**delegates** of the planning bodies are **elected** and the various
**proposals** are **presented** to everyone]{.underline} they concern.
In other words, representative democracy must be enriched -- and
improved -- by **[direct democracy]{.underline}** which [allows people
to choose directly]{.underline} -- locally, nationally and, ultimately,
internationally -- between different proposals. The whole population
would then make decisions on free public transit, on a special tax paid
by car owners to subsidize public transport, on the subsidization of
solar energy to make it competitive with fossil energy, on the reduction
of the hours of work to 30, 25 hours a week or less, even if this
entails a reduction in production.

The democratic nature of planning does not make it incompatible with the
participation of experts whose role is not to decide, but to present
their arguments -- often different, even opposed -- during the
democratic decision-making process. As Ernest Mandel said:

"Governments, parties, planning boards, **[scientists]{.underline}**,
technocrats or whoever [can **make suggestions**]{.underline}, put
forward proposals, try to influence people. To prevent them from doing
so would be to restrict political freedom. [But under a multi-party
system]{.underline}, such [proposals will never be
unanimous]{.underline}: [**people** will have the **choice**
between]{.underline} coherent [alternatives]{.underline}. And [the
**right**]{.underline} and power [to decide should be in the **hands**
of the **majority**]{.underline} of producers / consumers / citizens,
not of anybody else. What is paternalist or despotic about that?"2

[Is Socialism Stealing Innovation]{.underline}?

Sure, [**most [workers]{.mark}** and households
[get]{.mark}]{.underline} [as much money, if not
**[more]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} countries with
**[[socialist]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[societies]{.mark}
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} they do under
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And sure, socialist societies
appear to be [more healthy, happy, and equal]{.underline}, while having
more free time and fewer preventable deaths. But maybe it's because they
are [somehow free-riding on the backs of innovations that are due to the
magic of capitalism]{.underline}.

\<\<\<GRAPH\>\>\>

Nope[. [Capitalism]{.mark} does **[not]{.mark}** have]{.underline} a
[[**special ability** to innovate]{.underline}]{.mark}. While the most
socialist country (Norway) ranks less than the U.S., the [[U.S]{.mark}.
ranks **[below]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} is comparable to [Finland]{.underline}. Overall, the
**[[trend]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [[fairly
**weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with even [more]{.underline}
[variation]{.underline} [than]{.underline} [previous trend
lines]{.underline}. And "[innovation output]{.underline}" is a more
**[murky]{.underline}** [concept]{.underline} to measure than money,
health, equality, and leisure. But this [[data]{.underline} [does not
support]{.underline}]{.mark} [the idea that]{.underline}
[socialist]{.underline} countries [rely on innovation from
capitalism]{.underline}.

Conclusion: Bread and Roses

Socialists believe that society's means of production should serve
everyone. To get there, [[socialists]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[advocate]{.mark} [for]{.mark} state-owned firms and funds, [public
goods and **universal**]{.mark} [welfare]{.mark} programs]{.underline},
[democracy]{.underline} in government and at the worksite, and [labor
**[unions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other forms
of [worker [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Capitalists]{.underline} and
their ideological allies [argue]{.underline} all these
[institutions]{.underline} [impede]{.underline} the freedom of [owners
of private property]{.underline} --- who are the true engines of
prosperity. Through their investments and ingenuity, capitalists produce
so much wealth that even when they hoard most of it, everyone else is
ultimately richer, healthier, and happier. Societies that get in the way
of capitalists, even for noble purposes, are doomed to fail and be
miserable. And yet, when we look at the [countries that have most
impeded the freedom of capitalists]{.underline}, we find the opposite:
People living under socialism [are]{.underline} the ones most likely to
be [living the good life]{.underline}.

[[Under]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[Soviet]{.mark}** model, all
[enterprises]{.mark} were **owned** by the state]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [allocation]{.underline} decisions were made by a
**[[highly centralized]{.underline}]{.mark}** and hierarchical form of
economic planning. Five-year and one-year plans were formulated for the
entire country. [Enterprises]{.underline} [were given target
outputs]{.underline} and provided with the inputs and labor time needed
to produce them. [Enterprise decision-makers did **[not]{.mark}**
[aim]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **maximum [profit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
There were markets in the Soviet model in the sense that people bought
consumer goods in stores and workers decided on jobs in the labor
market. However, [buying and selling in the Soviet economy]{.underline}
[did not generate "market]{.underline} forces." Market forces refers to
a system in which relative profitability determines which products will
get additional inputs and which will be cut back. Thus, [market exchange
took place, but the system was not guided by market forces.]{.underline}

[Centralized economic planning]{.underline}
**[[transformed]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [Soviet]{.underline}
[economy]{.underline} [[from a]{.mark} [backward]{.mark}
[ag]{.mark}ricultural]{.underline} [[economy]{.mark} [to]{.mark} an
**[industrialized]{.mark}** economy [in **record**]{.mark}
**[time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [In just]{.underline} a couple of
[decades]{.underline}, [an industrial base]{.underline} was built that
[allowed]{.underline} the [Soviet]{.underline} Union [to produce
**military hardware**]{.underline} that was [key]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the [defeat]{.underline} of [Nazi Germany]{.underline}.
[Between]{.underline} the [1950-70s]{.underline}, the
[Soviet]{.underline} [economy]{.underline} [was [**growing** so

**[afraid]{.mark}** that [it would]{.mark}]{.underline} soon
**[[surpass]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[leading **capitalist
economies**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [Soviet]{.underline} model
[transformed]{.underline} the [lives]{.underline} of the Soviet people
[for the better]{.underline} in many measurable ways. Between 1950 and
1975, [consumption per person]{.underline} in the Soviet Union [grew
faster than in the U.S]{.underline}. By the 1980s, Soviet
[[production]{.underline} **[surpassed]{.underline}**]{.mark} that of
the [[U.S]{.mark}. in steel, cement, metal-cutting]{.underline} and
[metal-forming machines]{.underline}, [wheat, milk, and
cotton]{.underline}. It had [more doctors]{.underline} and [hospital
beds]{.underline} per capita than the United States. There was
[**[continuous]{.mark}** full **[employment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[stable prices]{.mark}**, [and no ups and downs]{.mark} of the
business cycle]{.underline}, while [income]{.underline} [was relatively

First, merely having an [[open]{.mark} and [democratic
society,]{.mark}]{.underline} with elected representatives answerable to
a voting public, would go a long way towards fixing some of the
shortcomings of the Soviet model. Such a society would [[not invest in
useless]{.underline}]{.mark} \"prestige
**[[goods\"]{.underline}]{.mark}** that do not improve anyone\'s
welfare, and, assuming that voters are concerned about their own future
and that of their children, steps would be taken to develop
[[environment]{.mark}ally-[friendly tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies
and innovations that make use of renewable energy sources. If innovation
is to be encouraged, taut planning would have to be abandoned, and
**[[enterprises]{.underline}]{.mark}** should
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** be **[[discouraged
from]{.underline}]{.mark}** taking **[[risks.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The
incentive structure should be less focused on penalties for failure and
provide [[more rewards for]{.mark} unexpected
[success**,**]{.mark}]{.underline} compared to the Soviet model.
Communication should be encouraged between enterprises and their
suppliers, and in fact it would be entirely feasible and desirable to
make all economic information publicly available. This contrasts with
the Soviet model, which operated under a siege mentality and placed a
high emphasis on secrecy. At the same time, the benefits of the Soviet
model could be maintained: [[**high** investment in]{.mark} basic
[science, public goods]{.mark}]{.underline} being given adequate
[[importance]{.mark}, and the [free circulation of]{.mark}]{.underline}
technical **[[knowledge without]{.underline}]{.mark}** legal barriers
imposed by [[patents or copyrights]{.underline}]{.mark}. 8 A
democratically planned [**[socialist economy]{.mark}** would [not suffer
from]{.mark} the [short]{.mark}comings of [innovation
]{.mark}]{.underline}under capitalism. The direction of
[[r]{.mark}esearch [a]{.mark}nd [i]{.mark}]{.underline}nvestment in the
pursuit of innovations in various fields could become matters of public
debate. It could be **[[democratically decided]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
for example, whether to invest in the pursuit of more efficient electric
cars or modernize the rail network instead. Thus, [[public and private
goods]{.underline}]{.mark} could be placed on a [[level playing field.
Innovations that are]{.underline}]{.mark} socially [[harmful]{.mark}
could [simply]{.mark}]{.underline} be [[abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark}
or not pursued in the first place, even when they are such that a
private firm could have gained an advantage in the marketplace by being
the first to adopt them

The story of today's geopolitics is still a story of a [[US]{.mark}-led,
Western international [order]{.mark}]{.underline}, but one that
[increasingly]{.underline} [faces]{.underline}
[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[[**contending** states and **popular movements**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Recent [shifts]{.underline} [in]{.underline} global [politics, economy,
and military]{.underline} [power]{.underline}, marked most recently by
the [[broad]{.underline}]{.mark} [popular]{.underline}
[[opposition]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Western-backed Israel's war
[in]{.underline} [Gaza]{.underline}, seem to [confirm]{.underline} this
[assessment]{.underline}. 

The [**rise** of]{.underline} potential [state challengers]{.underline}
to US dominance does not necessarily mean the ushering in of a new
progressive era. Nevertheless, it [represents **opportunities**
for]{.underline} [**social movements** to]{.underline}
[challenge]{.underline} [Western]{.underline} [imperialism]{.underline}.
These varied sub-imperial, emerging, and expansionist states may in
practice be tied into the dialectic relations of antagonistic
cooperation with the old imperial centre and authoritarian rule, but
under certain circumstances, they might share the same interests as the
working people's.

This is a [convergence of interest,]{.underline} if not values,
[between]{.underline} their foreign policy orientation and the
anti-imperialist, [[anti]{.mark}-[neoliberal]{.mark} goals of many
social movements [in]{.mark} the **[Global South]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Without having to become apologists for authoritarianism, these are
exactly the [opportunities]{.underline} [that social
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} [[should]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[seize]{.underline}]{.mark}** to advance their goals and effectively
confront imperialism.

[The **[Palestine]{.mark}** Solidarity Movement, the East and Southeast
Asian **Anti-Authoritarian** Movements, and the **[Latin]{.mark}
[American]{.mark}** Left]{.underline} have [[all **resisted**]{.mark}
authoritarian **[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} and/or imperialism.
Some of their strategies and tactics are still in their infancy and full
of contradictions, but they [provide]{.underline}
**[[reference]{.underline}]{.mark}** [points [for]{.mark} [future
action]{.mark}s and policies]{.underline}. Equally important, these
[movements]{.underline} have [show]{.underline}n, with varying degrees
of clarity and success, the [links between domestic despotism and
imperialism or the rule of international capital. ]{.underline}

The current conjunctures of global geopolitics might also [open up
**opportunities**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} a [broader]{.underline}
[**[transnational]{.mark}** [solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}, as

Women

As was noted in chapter 2, patriarchy -- male domination of females --
predates capitalism. [In]{.underline} the [capitalist era]{.underline},
the form of [patriarchy]{.underline} has [evolved over time]{.underline}
through its interaction with capitalism. Similarly to the case of
oppression of minor- ities based on race/ethnicity/nationality,
**[[gender hierarchy]{.underline}]{.mark}** can [**[divide]{.mark}** the
[working class]{.mark}]{.underline} [and offer a source of cheap labor
for capitalists]{.underline}. In some periods, [[male]{.mark}
**[domination]{.mark}**]{.underline} has been
[[strengthened]{.underline}]{.mark}, while in other periods capitalism
has tended to weaken patriarchy, as has occurred due to the large-scale
entry of women into wage labor since the 1950s. Nevertheless, patri-
archy has not been replaced by fully equal gender relations in
capitalist societies.

[Socialists]{.underline} have always [called for **liberation** of
women]{.underline}. [Mao]{.underline} Zedong [famously said "Women hold
up half the sky.]{.underline}" Women tend to be less supportive of
competitive behavior and are more disposed to cooperative and caring
behavior than men. [State [socialist]{.mark} countries
[achieved]{.mark}]{.underline} some of the [**[highest]{.mark}** rates
of [female]{.mark} **[labor]{.mark} force**
[participation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} many provided
[institutions]{.underline} that [[reduced]{.mark} the **burden** of
[household labor]{.mark},]{.underline} such as low-cost cafeterias at
work and low-cost or free childcare centers. However, as was noted in
chapter 4, [men dominated high-level positions in
enterprises]{.underline} and government in state socialist systems. Like
the movements against oppression by race/ethnicity/nationality, the
[feminist]{.underline} [movement against patriarchy]{.underline} has
[engaged]{.underline} its [constituency in [**collective**

Young people

people]{.underline}, especially those who have not yet entered a
long-term work role, [have an **ambiguous** class position]{.underline}
in the system. A young person grows up in a family that fits somewhere
into the class system, but it is not absolutely determined where the
young person will end up, given that capitalism does have a significant
degree of social mobility across generations, downward as well as
upward. Thus young people can tend to [view]{.underline} the

[During the past fifteen or twenty years, young people in
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} other [industrialized]{.underline} [capitalist
countries]{.underline} have [[faced]{.mark} [**deteriorating** economic
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Earlier chapters pointed out that this
stemmed from the raw form of capitalism since 1980 and the [financial
crisis]{.underline} it led to [in 20**[08]{.mark}**]{.underline}, after
which particularly [harmful economic trends affecting young people took
hold]{.underline}. [Rising **costs** of [housing]{.mark}]{.underline},
mushrooming [educa- tional **[debt]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[stagnating]{.underline}]{.mark}** real [[wages]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.mark} **disappearing**]{.underline} [stable [job]{.mark}
opportunitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline} have [led to **downward
mobility**]{.underline} for many young people, who believe they have no
hope of living as well as their parents. Thus today [young people
represent another]{.underline} part of the potential [political
[**base** of]{.mark} the **[socialist movement]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Public opinion **[surveys]{.mark}** support]{.underline} some of the
[claims]{.underline} here about the potential base of the socialist
movement. Recent [surveys in the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates have [[found]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[**favorable views** of socialism]{.mark} are]{.underline} particularly
[**[frequent]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} respondents who are
low-income]{.underline} (a rough indicator of class position),
**[[people of color]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Black, Hispanic, and Asian),
**[[women]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} those aged
18‒29]{.underline}.14 [Those who fight for the]{.underline} [rights of
labor, [minorities]{.mark}, and women]{.underline} in the United States
have often had the term "communist" hurled at them by opponents of such
rights. While those on the left often say in defense that such charges
are groundless, there may be something to the charge.
[Activism]{.underline} in favor of the rights of working people, people
of color, and women has [often been **led** by socialists]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [the struggles for such rights]{.underline}
[often]{.underline} do [[give rise to]{.mark} the

Methods of struggle for socialism

History has shown that a struggle for socialism that is limited to
electoral politics can win significant reforms, but it does not succeed
in reaching the goal of a transition to socialism. However, the
[electoral system in a high-income country with]{.underline} a
[[democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} form of
[[gov]{.mark}ernment]{.underline} [offers]{.underline} one important
[**[arena]{.mark}** [in which]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[socialist
movement]{.mark} can **[build]{.mark}** political
**[support]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} accumulate
political **[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In order to prevent the
electoral arena from becoming a trap that directs the socialist movement
away from its ultimate goal, it is [necessary]{.underline} at the same
time [to **[actively engage]{.mark}** in political
[struggles]{.mark}]{.underline} outside of that arena. That is, a
strategy of "above and below" is called for. The answer to the
long-debated question of whether to pursue an electoral road or
organizing in the workplace and the community is "both." However, that
should be understood as "both electoral work and organizing work plus a
close linking of the two."

[Socialist organizers should]{.underline} **[participate]{.underline}**
in the struggles of the six groups that form the potential base of the
socialist movement. That includes participating [in the
**[labor]{.mark}** move- ment]{.underline}, the
[**[anti-racist]{.mark}** movement, and the **[feminist]{.mark}**
movement]{.underline}. It [calls]{.underline} [for activism on
**[environmental]{.mark} sustainability**]{.underline} and [oppo- sition
to imperialism and]{.underline} war. It calls for involvement in the
struggles for [affordable **[housing]{.mark}**, [abolition of]{.mark}
student **[debt]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [free]{.mark} **higher
[education]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which particularly
[address]{.underline} [problems affecting young people. It]{.underline}
[calls for **community organizing**]{.underline} in the communities
where members of the six groups live.

Socialist organizers should [employ]{.underline} a wide variety of
tactics and methods of organizing, including [union]{.underline}
organizing, [community]{.underline} organizing, [tenant organizing,
anti-racism]{.underline} work, [running for elected office]{.underline}
in all levels of government from local school boards to representatives
in Congress, seeking office in trade unions from shop steward to union
executive board and officer positions, and [organizing protest
demonstra- tions]{.underline}. [Socialists]{.underline} should [engage
in educational work]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the traditional
[mass media, social media, alternative media, and socialist educational
programs]{.underline}. Socialists should also [participate]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} building [local institutions]{.underline} [that embody
some]{.underline} of the [principles]{.underline} of a future socialist
system, such as cooperatives and worker-run companies.

[To **[avoid]{.mark}** a **[division]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [socialist [movement]{.mark}]{.underline}
into electoral and organizing camps, the two types of [activity must be
woven closely together]{.underline}. In the United States, some elected
officials in state and local legislatures who are members of
[D]{.underline}emocratic [S]{.underline}ocialists of
[A]{.underline}merica (DSA) have sought to [pursue]{.underline}
[such]{.underline} a [practice]{.underline}. They have used their
position as elected officials to help build local working-class
organizations and tenant unions. They have built close ongoing
connections to local DSA chapters and activist organizations and
campaigns, not just during an election period but in developing and
imple- menting the policy agenda for the socialist official after the
election. They have hired DSA activists and activists in other
progressive groups for staff positions. They have enlisted local DSA
chapters for analyzing bills that will be coming before the legislature.
They seek to pass measures that are aligned with DSA priorities. [Such
practices]{.underline} can [keep]{.underline} the [elected officials and
organizers **[united]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} their [pursuit of]{.mark}
both **[reform]{.mark} and socialist transformation.**]{.underline}

How do we strategically confront this challenge? On one hand, rather
than hoping for smooth democratic transitions to ecosocialist degrowth
or sidestepping difficult questions about the transition period,
[ecosocialists]{.underline} [should]{.underline} [reflect]{.underline}
[more systematically on the domestic and international
threats]{.underline} [that]{.underline} ecosocialisms-in-[transition
would confront]{.underline} -- including capital flight, of course, but
also militant far-right resistance, cyberattacks, social media-enhanced
disinformation operations from capitalists and counterrevolutionary
states, and other forms of sabotage -- and how they might respond.
Furthermore, ideological commitments to radical democracy should not
prevent [[ecosocialists]{.underline}]{.mark} from at least
[maintain]{.underline}ing an "[**[open]{.mark}ness** [to]{.mark} some
degree of **[hard power]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the
[state]{.mark}]{.underline}," as Malm suggests, or to the possible
necessity of [[repurposing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[state's]{.underline} [[**coercive** apparatus to]{.mark}
**[defend]{.mark}** ecosocialist]{.underline}
**[[transition]{.mark}s]{.underline}** from reactionary currents (Malm
2020, 153). The specific strategies this might entail would vary
according to the national-political context, but the point here is that
such problems must be anticipated and systematically explored in advance
in order to work out creative solutions.

On the other hand, [if authoritarian or coercive measures]{.underline}
are indeed [deemed necessary to defend]{.underline}
[ecosocialisms-in-transition]{.underline}, then we must also
[envision]{.underline} [strategies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} may
[enable]{.underline} [ecosocialist]{.underline} [regimes]{.underline} to
[navigate]{.underline} the "[emergency]{.underline}" [phase]{.underline}
while [[laying]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[long]{.mark}er-[term]{.mark}** conditions for "**extension** of
**popular [democratic]{.mark} [control]{.mark}**]{.underline} over state
and society," rather than irreversibly institutionalizing authoritarian
forms of emergency rule (Petras and Fitzgerald 1988, 93). Lebowitz and
Kovel, for instance, [emphasize]{.underline} the [importance of
building]{.underline} and nurturing [**new** forms of democratic
**[self-governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} from below that can
[[avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} or at least [attenuate tendencies toward
[**authoritarian** statism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kovel 2007; Lebowitz
2006). Indeed, [as]{.underline} [many ecosocialists, ecofeminists, and
degrowth scholars recognize]{.underline}, [interstitial
movements]{.underline} like commoning, Transition Towns, solidarity
economies, peasant-based agroecology networks, and indigenous
sovereignty (among others) [can be considered "**seeds**" of an
ecosocialist degrowth]{.underline} **[participatory
democracy]{.underline}** (Kallis et al. 2020; Salleh 2017; Kovel 2007).
Of course, while there are [thousands of such initiatives and movements
across the planet]{.underline}, they remain small and imperfect oases in
a vast desert of alienated consumption (especially in the global north).
Thus the question is how [these movements might [gain **wider**
participation]{.mark}, propagate, and with time forge critical masses of
[mutually-supportive cooperative economies]{.mark}]{.underline} at local
and regional scales (Kallis et al. 2020, 46). One key objective of a
[**[radical GND]{.mark}** should]{.underline} be to [channel state
funding and legal protection for these initiatives so that they can
steadily grow and **[protect]{.mark}** themselves [from]{.mark}
[capitalist pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kallis et al. 2020). This
should also be [accompanied]{.underline} [by programs to
revitalize]{.underline} [rural regions]{.underline} that have become
seedbeds of rightwing populism---involving an [antitrust assault on big
agribusiness]{.underline}, relieving pressures on small and medium scale
family farms, and investing in rural hospitals, internet, and localized
rural-urban food supply chains---thereby addressing the insecurities and
grievances felt by many in these communities (Hogseth 2020). Together,
these [initiatives]{.underline} could help [grow]{.underline} the
[micro-foundations of]{.underline} an [ecosocialist participatory
democracy]{.underline} [while]{.underline}
**[[weakening]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [currents of **[rightwing
populism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though this would be a slow
multi-decadal process. [We should not disregard the potential for social
tipping points]{.underline} (Kallis et al. 2020, 89), but even in a
bestcase scenario where democratic majorities become involved in or
supportive of these alternative economies, many people will resist
giving up energy-intensive consumption, mobility, and dietary habits,
providing ample opportunities for recalcitrant capitalists, far-right
forces, and counter-revolutionary states to foment division and
counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The "[democratic]{.underline}" [in "**[democratic]{.mark}
[socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}" is [important]{.underline}. While the
planning process itself must be democratic and participatory in its
design, the **[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}** [must [also]{.mark} be
democratic]{.underline}. It was noted in chapter 2 that [democracy
[under]{.mark} [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} is
**[limited]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} the power of the [capitalist
class]{.underline}. [With no [wealthy]{.mark}]{.underline} and powerful
[ruling class to [distort]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and limit]{.mark}
democracy]{.underline}, [[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}
[can]{.underline} potentially [be **[more]{.mark}**]{.underline}
thoroughly [[democratic than capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Socialism is [better]{.underline} at defeating fascism.

[[History]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[shown]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
when [socialists]{.mark} participate]{.underline} [in a **broad front**
[against]{.mark} [fascism]{.mark}]{.underline}, not only can they
[[make]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[major]{.mark}** [contribution]{.mark}
to **[defeating]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}, but at
the same time they can [**[strengthen]{.mark}** the **[socialist]{.mark}
[movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [communist]{.underline} parties in
[Nazi-occupied Europea]{.underline}n states greatly
[increased]{.underline} their popular [support]{.underline} through
their leading role in the anti-fascist resistance. [In the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in the mid- and late 1930s, the
devastating effects of the [Great Depression spurred a growing fascist
movement]{.underline}. The [[New Deal]{.underline}]{.mark} turned left
in the mid-1930s, under pressure from militant and usually left-led
worker trade union and community protests. The [Communist Party followed
a popular front policy]{.underline} that included quietly supporting the
[[Roosevelt]{.underline}]{.mark} Administration while pushing it to
respond to the needs of working people. The
[[fascists]{.underline}]{.mark} [were
**[marginalized]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as **[millions]{.mark}** of
working people across the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, including in the South, [**[turned]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **[left]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} the
[right]{.mark}]{.underline}.25 By contrast, the inability of the
moderate Socialist Party and the Communist Party in Weimar Germany to
work together facilitated the rise to state power of the Nazis.

The current political context demands that [socialists]{.underline}
pursue two different projects simultaneously. We [must build an
[alliance]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **progressive
[reform]{.mark}**]{.underline} and ultimately socialism while at the
same time joining, and even seeking to lead, the construction of a
[[broad]{.mark} **anti-fascist** [front]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both
projects [require a politics]{.underline} that is [focused
on]{.underline} [building]{.underline} the [power]{.underline} [to
advance toward]{.underline} our [goals]{.underline} [rather]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} treating politics as an [opportunity to
demonstrate]{.underline} our [political purity]{.underline} by refusing
to associate with groups whose long-run aims do not coincide with ours.

The [next]{.underline} round of [transitions to socialism]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the [world]{.underline} is [not]{.underline} likely to
[occur simultaneously]{.underline} all around the world. It seems
certain that socialist transitions will take place at first in only some
countries. The [world]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [again have a
**mixture** of capitalist and socialist systems]{.underline}, this time
with the latter hopefully [based]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
[democratic socialism]{.underline}. While the capitalist West always
claimed that its opposition to Communist Party- ruled states was based
on their repressive features, it is likely that a
[**[democratic]{.mark}** [**socialist bloc**]{.mark} of
states]{.underline} would appear [even **more [threaten]{.mark}ing** to
[capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it would [make]{.underline}
[socialism]{.underline} [more **[appealing]{.mark}** [to working]{.mark}
**[people]{.mark}** in]{.underline} [the capitalist
countries]{.underline}, which is the [real threat posed]{.underline} by
socialism to capitalism. Hopefully, such a [period]{.underline} can be
[[passed]{.underline}]{.mark} through **[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[a **[major]{.mark} [war]{.mark}** on the way to a world of socialist
states]{.underline}.

Even a world of [socialist]{.underline} [states might encounter some
instances]{.underline} [of imperialist behavior]{.underline}.
Neighboring states with a border area having valuable
[materials]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} a [mismatch]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} legal [borders]{.underline} and the nationality of
the population near the border, could give rise to conflicts. However,
such [[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} should be [**[more
manageable]{.mark}** in a world that [lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[capitalist **drive** for **[imperial]{.mark}**
[domination]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Socialist ideas]{.underline} have
always given a prominent [place]{.underline} to a vision of [a world in
which **[cooperation]{.mark}** and pursuit of **mutual** benefit
[regulate]{.mark} [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps that can be
approached in a world of democratic socialist states. In the far future,
one can imagine a [transfer of the coercive power of armed forces to a
democratic global entity]{.underline}, [leaving]{.underline}
nation-[[states]{.mark} with [**no means** to]{.mark} [exercise]{.mark}
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline} outside their boundaries.

It may be hard for those who lived through the Cold War to believe, but
a [**[higher]{.mark}** [percentage]{.mark} of]{.underline} [18- to

**[favor]{.mark}able** view of **[socialism]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} of
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the only age group for which this
was true, [according to a Pew Research Center survey from
2022]{.underline}. [Only **40%** of American]{.underline} young people
[have a positive impression of capitalism]{.underline}, while [**44%**
have a favorable view of socialism]{.underline}. Just [15 years ago, a
Gallup poll found]{.underline} that [two-thirds]{.underline} of
millennials and Gen-Zers viewed capitalism [positively]{.underline}, a
share that [dropped to 51% by 2019]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [Americans aged 18 to 29 had the [**dimmest** view of]{.mark}
[our]{.mark} own form of [government]{.mark}]{.underline}. While 66% had
a "very favorable" or "favorable" view of democratic republics,
[a]{.underline} [**quarter** of young adults]{.underline} in the U.S.
[had a "very" or "somewhat" favorable view of
communism]{.underline}, according to a 2024 YouGov survey.

It's [no surprise]{.underline}, then, that [the [Revolutionary]{.mark}
[Communists]{.mark} of America]{.underline}, a party
"[[committed]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the **complete [overthrow]{.mark}** [of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}," says that it
has **[[doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
[[membership]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nationally]{.underline}** [and
received]{.underline} [more than 6,000]{.underline} new online member
[applications]{.underline} over the last 16 months. Though still a
fringe group, its [**[growth]{.mark}** is
**[alarming]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Such [shifts don't come from nowhere]{.underline}.
**[[Students]{.underline}]{.mark}** [across the U.S. are being
**[influenced]{.mark}** [by teachers]{.mark} and peers [who embrace
communism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The Colorado Education Association, which represents nearly **[40,000
teachers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [passed a resolution]{.underline} in
2023 [**condemning** capitalism]{.underline} and stating that it
"[inherently exploits children, public schools, land, labor and
resources]{.underline}." That same year, Virginia's largest teacher
union opposed a state bill to teach the history of communism, saying it
could lead to anti-Asian hate since most communist countries today are
in Asia. Last year, a [Michigan State University history professor
wrote]{.underline} an article explaining communism to children and left
out the mass violence, poverty and human rights violations at the hands
of all the governments who've imposed it, concluding only that
"[[Communists]{.mark} are **[optimistic]{.mark}** that humans can one
day create a more fair and equal society."]{.underline}

On [**[college]{.mark}** [campuses]{.mark}]{.underline}, examples abound
that show students don't understand -- or care about -- the reality of
communism either. Some are merely symbolic, including the [reflexive
**[glorification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} notorious **[Marxist
revolutionary]{.mark}** figure Che Guevara at the Che Guevara
Cafeon]{.underline} the campus of the University of California, San
Diego.

Others involve [active inculcation of communist beliefs and
tactics]{.underline}, [such as student groups]{.underline} that have
looked to communist organizations as they [protest the war in
Gaza]{.underline}. [Anti-Israel protesters]{.underline} at Stanford
University [partnered with the Party for Socialism and
Liberation]{.underline}. The Revolutionary Communists of America said it
advised student protestors at Arizona State University on tactics to set
up a pro-Palestine encampment. [At Columbia University last]{.underline}

[circulating on campus]{.underline} during the height of the protests.

The great philosopher Spinoza said that the task of philosophy was
neither to weep, nor to laugh, but to understand. In order to understand
Donald J Trump, we must leave aside the pseudoscience of demonology and
state the obvious. To begin with, whatever else he might be, Trump is
not some evil spirit, endowed with superhuman powers. He is an ordinary
mortal -- insofar as an American billionaire may be considered such. And
like any other figure of relevance in history, the real causes of his
rise to power must ultimately be connected with objective processes at
work in society. In other words, we must see it as inevitably connected
with the objective situation of the world in the [early decades of the
21st century. The [major turning point]{.mark} in modern history
[was]{.mark} the 20[08]{.mark} crisis, which completely [destabilised
the]{.mark} whole [system.]{.mark} [Capitalism]{.mark} found itself
teetering on the [brink of collapse.]{.mark} When Lehman Brothers
collapsed, I vividly remember the moment in which bankers publicly
expressed their fears that within a few months they'd be swinging from
the lamp posts. Those fears were actually well grounded. In fact, all
the objective [conditions]{.mark} were [ripe,]{.mark} actually, [for
socialist revolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. That was only avoided by the
adoption of panic measures in which the state intervened to save the
banks by the injection of huge quantities of public money. This
contradicted all the theories promoted by the official bourgeois
economists for the previous thirty years. They all agreed that the state
must play no role -- or a minimal role -- in the economy. The free
market, left to itself, would solve all problems. In the moment of
truth, however, this theory was shown to be false. The capitalist system
was only saved by state intervention. But this created [[new
contradictions in]{.mark} the form of colossal and ultimately
[unsustainable debt]{.mark}s. [Since]{.mark} 20[08,]{.mark} the
capitalist system has been in the [deepest crisis in history.]{.mark} It
has constantly lurched from one [disaster to another]{.mark}. At every
step, governments resorted to the same irresponsible policy of deficit
financing -- that is to say, printing money]{.underline} to get
themselves out of a hole. The myopic strategists of capital, the
miserable tribe of bourgeois economists and the even more bankrupt
political establishment politicians all assumed that this situation --
infinite supplies of money plucked out of thin air, an inexhaustible
flow of cheap credit, low rates of inflation and low interest rates --
was going to continue forever. They were mistaken. All this was merely
[piling up [contradiction upon]{.mark} contradiction -- preparing the
ground for the mother of all crises in the future. I predicted at the
time that all the attempts of the bourgeoisie to restore economic
equilibrium would merely serve to destroy the social and political
equilibria. This is precisely what has happened. Since 2008, the
capitalist system has been in the deepest crisis in history. They
resorted to printing money to get themselves out of the hole, but this
merely piled up contradiction upon contradiction / Image: Own work The
objective [conditions for socialist revolution were]{.mark} clearly
[present.]{.mark} Why did it not occur? Only because one important
factor was [missing]{.mark} from this equation. That [factor]{.mark} was
[revolutionary leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [assertion]{.underline} [that state planners are prone to
corruption]{.underline} is not limited to socialist planning as levels
of corruption and fraud [exist in **capitalist** market
societies]{.underline} [where]{.underline} armies of accountants are
required to check (not always successfully) company accounts.
[**[Private]{.mark}** companies]{.underline} also [[engage

planning, is that bureaucratically managed enterprises will not promote
invention; without private property there is an absence of a propensity

economies are able to innovate.]{.underline} The [UK,]{.underline} for
example, in the late twentieth century, [lost]{.underline} most of its
[capacity for manufacturing due to the uncompetitiveness]{.underline}
[of its products]{.underline}. The post- communist states, notably
Russia and Ukraine, have had less investment and innovation under the
market than they had under the planned Soviet system. Hence [something
more than private ownership]{.underline} and a free market [is needed to
explain the success]{.underline} and/ [or failure of states to
innovate]{.underline}.

There is [no disadvantage under socialism to pursue

### Alt\-\--Socialism\-\--AT: Central Planning Fails\-\--2NC

#### [Transition]{.underline} towards [central planning]{.underline} is happening\-\--[government]{.underline} action is key.

CENTRAL PLANNING: BETWEEN EFFICIENCY AND FREEDOM ",

I contest F. A. [Hayek's]{.underline} assertion that the conditions for
an efficient planned economy can never materialize. On the contrary, I
argue that the [validity]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [his claim is
contingent upon the state of technology in a given society and the types
of socio-technological practices that people engage in.]{.underline}
[Advances]{.underline} [in]{.underline} data processing
[technologies]{.underline} might [render]{.underline} an [economic order
based on central planning possible to realize and potentially more
efficient than a market economy relying on private property and contract
exchange]{.underline}. In this Article, I analyze the theoretical
preconditions of an efficient centrally planned economy and demonstrate
that the theory and practice of contemporary information technology
suggest that we might soon be able to meet them. As a result, the
argument goes, economic planning---as opposed to a market
paradigm---might be worth putting back on the table by progressive
economists.

Consequently, we might soon face a choice between efficiency, welfare,
and convenience on the one hand, and freedom and autonomy on the other.
In other words, we will need to confront the question: do we prefer the
liberal world of contract, property, and market exchange over a world of
command and control because we believe it is more efficient, or because
we think it is morally superior? As of today, "both" is a perfectly good
answer. It just so happens that [societies that embraced the market
paradigm, particularly a highly regulated market with significant wealth
redistribution, simultaneously enjoy higher levels of welfare and higher
levels of individual autonomy.]{.underline}2 When, however, planning
becomes more efficient (or, put differently, less inefficient) than
markets, we will have to choose. A Chicago-style economic analysis of
law that asks "what are the efficient rules of property and contract?"
might soon lead us to answer: "none whatsoever."

[If we]{.underline} do not confront this question, and [continue to
insist that individual freedom and economic efficiency]{.underline}
necessarily [go hand in hand, we may move from a market economy to an
algorithmically planned economy without making a conscious decision to
do so]{.underline}. Not overnight, maybe not even within one generation,
but tacitly, step-by-step, the [transition will occur]{.underline}.
Almost by accident, one could say. Putting forth a general claim about
human "nature,"3 I hypothesize that a sufficiently large number of
individuals could happily give up some freedom in exchange for more
welfare and more convenience. In this sense, planning will lead us to
some form of authoritarianism, where an entity external to the
individual will be telling her what to do and what to consume. However,
[unlike with the twentieth century's socialist states, authoritarianism
will emerge not because the planning will fail, but because it will
succeed in delivering more efficient outcomes than markets]{.underline}.
[Individuals]{.underline} will not be stripped of political and economic
freedom; they will voluntarily give it up.4

Before analyzing the normative questions posed by an algorithmically
planned economy, I use Part II to outline the history of the idea and
practice of central planning and articulate the conceptual [differences
between a heavily regulated market economy and a centrally planned
economy]{.underline}. Part III then describes the historical objections
to a centrally planned economy and explains how [technological
advances]{.underline} might [allow its proponents to overcome their
critics' longstanding objections]{.underline}. Part IV is a thought
experiment: I describe a hypothetical day in an algorithmically planned
life. I use this hypothetical to discuss how we might have to
normatively decide whether freedom from want is preferable to the
freedom of economic choice or vice versa. In Part V, I consider the role
of law in facilitating this change of socioeconomic systems. Ultimately,
I conclude that [the shift to a centrally planned economy will occur
only if the law allows it to do so, but law alone is insufficient to
prevent the change. By "allows" I]{.underline} do not [mean]{.underline}
"not prohibiting" in some public sense, but rather [creating
institutional frameworks that incentivize socio-technological moves in
the direction of central planning.]{.underline} The
[current]{.underline} legal foundations of the market economy,
[including]{.underline} almost [unlimited freedom]{.underline} [to
use]{.underline} personal [information]{.underline} and directly market
goods and services [in micro-targeted]{.underline} [way]{.underline},
paired with the value of efficiency as the guiding principle for many
private lawyers, has set us on a path that might soon render contract
and property law obsolete. And, if we believe these changes are
normatively undesirable, we should react by putting certain legal
constraints in place, or by changing the incentives. More profoundly,
however, we should engage in broader cultural and philosophical debates
about the relationship between efficiency and convenience on the one
hand, and freedom or autonomy on the other.

These criticisms resulted in theoretical responses from socialist
economists. Most famously, [Lange proposed to use computers to fulfill
these tasks.]{.underline}38 In his view, the [problem]{.underline} was
not theoretical but [practical]{.underline}---the task might be hard,
but [not impossible]{.underline}.39 Eventually, technological progress
would render theoretical possibilities a reality.40 [Lange
acknowledged]{.underline} the [moral value of markets in determining how
goods and wealth should be distributed]{.underline}. However, since the
operation of markets comes with social and individual costs, he believed
that we do not really need to live in the market and suffer all the
negative consequences--- we can just simulate them.41 In 1936, he
suggested the [trial and error approach to different ways of conducting
central planning]{.underline},42 and thirty years later he argued that,
thanks to computing technology, [we]{.underline} might [receive the
benefits of markets without bearing the costs]{.underline}. He wrote:

The market mechanism and trial and error procedure proposed in my essay
really played the role of a computing device for solving a system of
simultaneous equations

. . . . Such an electronic analogue . . . simulates the working of the
market. This statement, however, may be reversed: the market simulates
the electronic analogue computer. In other words, the
[market]{.underline} may be [considered]{.underline} [as a computer sui
generis which serves to solve a system of simultaneous
equations]{.underline}. . . . The market may be considered as one of the
oldest historical devices for solving simultaneous equations.43

Note that, to Lange, individual preferences and choices did matter.
[There is value in letting people do what they want and rewarding them
with what they enjoy for their labor.]{.underline} However, as is clear
to us and was clear to Lange, [only]{.underline} very [few individuals
actually enjoy significant freedom in choosing:]{.underline} individuals
are limited by resource scarcity, market inefficiency, and inherent
market unfairness. Knowing what resources are available, and what
individuals' preferences are, might allow us---through trial and
error---to simulate the market. [We could then arrive at a more
efficient allocation than the market itself,]{.underline} respecting
individual preferences to a no lesser degree. [Computers would make this
possible.]{.underline}

[A rapid westernization of the Second World followed---a transition to
capitalism and a market economy, and the construction of the
institutions necessary for the market's operation.]{.underline} From
Tallinn to Tirana one could see the emergence of central banks, stock
exchanges, privatization of public property and companies, and
liberalization of the laws governing the economy. On the global level,
the world of the 1990s became smaller, the General Agreements on Tariffs
and Trade morphed into the World Trade Organization,46 trade thrived,
Ricardo smiled in his grave,47 automation continued. Quite rapidly,
[economic thinking converged]{.underline}: one no longer found books on
"economics of capitalism" and "economics of socialism," but simply
"economics." Young economists in the twenty-first century often do not
even read Hayek. [The field has completely internalized the core of his
theory. The debates we have, even the heated ones, all take place within
the market economy paradigm.]{.underline}

[Nevertheless]{.underline}, in 2020, [few share]{.underline} the
[optimism]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the [inevitable progress of
the economy and political freedom that prevailed thirty years ago.
I]{.underline}n the West, [social inequalities are on the
rise]{.underline},48 the glass ceiling seems thick,49 and the amount of
[low-paid jobs is not shrinking, unlike the middle class]{.underline}.50
On the political level, reasons for optimism do not abound, either.
["Authoritarianism" is a strong word,]{.underline} but we hear it often
uttered in and about Trump's United States, as well as Turkey, Hungary,
Poland, and Brazil, and of course Russia.51 The United Kingdom struggles
to leave the European Union.52 [China serves as proof that political
freedom does not necessarily follow economic freedom.]{.underline}53
Amidst [weather anomalies caused by climate change and global
warming]{.underline}, we try to understand the changes around us, and we
desperately try to think of a way of stopping, if not reversing them.

At the same time, we witness significant [technological
innovations]{.underline}.54 The proliferation of personal computers and
smart devices connected via wireless networks has [led to countless
online services]{.underline}. Communication, shopping, banking, dating,
reading news, and many other mundane activities are now mediated by
technology. The line between being online and offline is getting
blurrier.55 [All this triggers changes in social life and simultaneously
documents them.]{.underline}

#### Australian Election shows growing [anti-capitalist]{.underline} sentiment worldwide.

[The result of the **election** confirmed the **party's stress** on the
primacy of global developments]{.underline}. Against predictions,
[**[Labor]{.mark}** was [returned to]{.mark} **majority
[government]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But contrary to its claims and those
of the media, this was not the result of a masterful Labor campaign.
Instead, [masses of [people]{.mark} [repudiated]{.mark} the
[Coalition]{.mark}, [because]{.mark} it was [associated with
**Trump**]{.mark} and his **fascistic agenda**.]{.underline}

Notwithstanding the return of a Labor government, the [election
underscored the [**deepening crisis** of]{.mark} the entire
**[capitalist]{.mark} political**
[establishment]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Liberals have been
decimated, and the Coalition is in meltdown. But Labor received only
34.8 percent of the primary vote, less than 2 percent above its 2022
result, which was its lowest since the 1930s. [After decades of
enforcing the dictates of the banks and the corporations, Labor no
longer has any stable mass base in the **working class**.]{.underline}

The election was again marked by a growth of support for third parties
and independents, with their share of the vote at 33 percent the highest
in history. [For the first time, [third party ballots exceeded those of
one of the major parties]{.mark}, the Coalition.]{.underline}

[Within that broader trend, there was a clear [**growth** in
**anti-capitalist** sentiment]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition to the
votes for the SEP, nationwide in the Senate, [more than 116,000 votes
were cast for parties with "**socialist**" in their
name]{.underline}---nearly double the 60,515 recorded in 2022 and more
than five times the 22,420 in 2019[. That underscores a [growing
constituency among workers]{.mark} and young people [for a socialist

Increasing human population, and the need to expand food production,
were the drivers of the Green Revolution over 50 years ago (150). This
[increased [productivity through]{.mark}]{.underline} selective
**[genetic [breeding]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[monocultures]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[seed
improvement]{.underline}**, [and the use of]{.underline} **[chemical

**[[not solved]{.underline}]{.mark}** the problem of [**[food
insecurity]{.underline}** [which has been]{.underline}
**[aggravated]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in more vulnerable
populations]{.underline} (151). Worldwide, it is estimated that 16,000
children are pushed into hunger every day---a 32% increase from 2022
(152). Agriculture now uses half of the world's ice- and desert-free
land, and causes 78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication
(153). [Pesticide and fertilizer runoff]{.underline}, as well as sewage,
find their way to aquatic environments (154) and [degrade water quality,
[while]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[spreading]{.underline}**]{.mark}

the oceans]{.underline}. [Microplastics]{.underline} **[reduce
beneficial]{.underline}** [bacteria concentrations, and]{.underline} can
be [absorbed by plants, and then passed up the food chain]{.underline}
(155). [Industrial farming employs]{.underline} **[deep
plowing]{.underline}** [that [depletes]{.mark} and oxidizes]{.underline}
**[[soil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, turning acreage into a source of GHG
(156). Agriculture is responsible for 70% of global freshwater
withdrawals (157). By one estimate (158), 94% of nonhuman mammal biomass
is now livestock, and 71% of bird biomass is poultry livestock. 50% of
all agricultural expansion has come at the expense of forests. In 2022,
the rate of global deforestation was the equivalent of 11
soccer/football fields per minute (40), predominantly for cattle
ranching and grain animal feed crops (such as soy) for export. Today,
agriculture uses half of all habitable land (159), and either through
grazing or growing animal feed, 77% of that is dedicated to livestock
(153). Animal agriculture is expanding. From 1998 to 2018 global meat
consumption increased 58%. Cattle and the grain they eat use 1/3 of all
available land surface, 1/3 of global grain production, and 16% of all
available freshwater. Yet cattle agriculture only generates 18% of food
calories and 27% of protein (153). The production of fertilizer for feed
crops emits 41 MtCO2/yr. The combination of emissions from
manufacturing, transporting, and applying synthetic fertilizer on the
land (which releases the potent GHG N2O) today likely outpaces the
emissions of the commercial aviation industry. These
**[[fertilizer-related]{.mark} GHG [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[are [projected to grow]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, [livestock
feed demands a]{.underline} **[minimum]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[80% of]{.underline} global [soybean crop and]{.underline} over [50%

A third of the world's workforce is employed in agriculture: from
farming through to factory food [production, food services and finally
the food hospitality and retail sector. But many of the [people
who]{.mark}se labour [produce]{.mark}s the [food]{.mark} we need are
[barely]{.mark} paid enough to [survive]{.mark} themselves. Just [four
corporations own 90% of]{.mark} the global [grain]{.mark} trade, and
nations are morphing into super-importers and super-exporters of goods.
Trade travels]{.underline} through just a few routes such as through the
Suez and Panama canals, the Turkish straits, and the straits of Hormuz
and Malacca, which connect many places of production with places of
consumption. If these routes become vulnerable or blocked due to war or
other factors, **[[food shortage]{.underline}]{.mark}**s are
**[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like the current shortages of the
world's supply of sunflower oil (Ukraine). Add to this the issue of
climate change, and it is without a doubt that food precarity is only
going to get worse. Farming techniques could play a role in reducing and
reversing climate change, as soils contain twice the amount of carbon in
the atmosphere. If farming methods such as direct-drilling and methods
which reduce soil disturbance were employed on a wide scale, this could
have a monumental effect on carbon emissions. But these are less
profitable. It's paramount that we [[loosen]{.mark} the grip
[major]{.mark} [corporations]{.mark} have [on]{.mark} the [food
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need **[[large farming

All human societies experience recurrent waves of political crisis, such
as the one we face today. My research team built a [database of
**hundreds** of societies across **10,000** years]{.underline} to try to
find out what causes them. We [examined **dozens** of
variables]{.underline}, including population numbers, measures of
[**well-being**, forms of **governance**]{.underline}, and the frequency
with which rulers are overthrown. We found that the precise mix of
events that leads to crisis varies, but [two [**drivers** of
instability]{.mark} loom large]{.underline}. The first is **[[popular
immiseration]{.underline}]{.mark}**---when the [[**economic**
fortunes]{.mark} of broad swaths of a population
**[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The second, and more significant, is
elite overproduction---when a society produces too many superrich and
ultra-educated people, and not enough elite positions to satisfy their
ambitions.

These forces have played a key role in our current crisis. In the past
50 years, [[**despite** overall]{.mark} economic **[growth]{.mark}**,
the [**quality** of life for most]{.mark} Americans has
**[declined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The wealthy have become wealthier,
while the incomes and [**[wages]{.mark}** of the median American family
have **[stagnated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a result, our [[**social**
pyramid]{.mark} has become **[top-heavy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the
same time, the U.S. began overproducing graduates with advanced degrees.
More and more people aspiring to positions of power began fighting over
a relatively fixed number of spots. The [**[competition]{.mark}** among
them has **[corroded]{.mark}** the social norms and
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that govern society.

The U.S. has gone through this twice before. The first time ended in
civil war. But the second led to a period of unusually broad-based
prosperity. Both offer lessons about today's dysfunction and, more
important, how to fix it.

To understand the root causes of the current crisis, let's start by
looking at how the number of über-wealthy Americans has grown. Back in
1983, 66,000 American households were worth at least \$10 million. That
may sound like a lot, but by 2019, controlling for inflation, the number
had increased tenfold. A similar, if smaller, upsurge happened lower on
the food chain. The number of households worth \$5 million or more
increased sevenfold, and the number of mere millionaires went up
fourfold.

On its surface, having more wealthy people doesn't sound like such a bad
thing. But at whose expense did elites' wealth swell in recent years?

Starting in the 1970s, although the overall economy continued to grow,
the share of that growth going to average workers began to shrink, and
real wages leveled off. (It's no coincidence that Americans' average
height---a useful proxy for well-being, economic and otherwise---stopped
increasing around then too, even as average heights in much of Europe
continued climbing.) By 2010, the relative wage (wage divided by GDP per
capita) of an unskilled worker had nearly halved compared with
mid-century. For the 64 percent of Americans who didn't have a four-year
college degree, real wages shrank in the 40 years before 2016.

As wages diminished, the costs of owning a home and going to college
soared. To afford an average house, a worker earning the median wage in
2016 had to log 40 percent more hours than she would have in 1976. And
parents without a college degree had to work four times longer to pay
for their children's college.

Even college-educated Americans aren't doing well across the board. They
made out well in the 1950s, when fewer than 15 percent of
18-to-24-year-olds went to college, but not today, when more than 60
percent of high-school grads immediately enroll. To get ahead of the
competition, more college graduates have sought out advanced degrees.
From 1955 to 1975, the number of students enrolled in law school
tripled, and from 1960 to 1970, the number of doctorate degrees granted
at U.S. universities more than tripled. This was manageable in the
post--World War II period, when the number of professions requiring
advanced degrees shot up. But when the demand eventually subsided, the
supply didn't. By the 2000s, degree holders greatly outnumbered the
positions available to them. The imbalance is most acute in the social
sciences and humanities, but the U.S. hugely overproduces degrees even
in STEM fields.

This is part of a broader trend. Compared with 50 years ago, far more
Americans today have either the financial means or the academic
credentials to pursue positions of power, especially in politics. But
the number of those positions hasn't increased, which has led to fierce
competition.

Competition is healthy for society, in moderation. But the competition
we are witnessing among America's elites has been anything but moderate.
It has created very few winners and masses of resentful losers. It has
brought out the dark side of meritocracy, encouraging rule-breaking
instead of hard work.

All of this has left us with a large and growing class of frustrated
elite aspirants, and a large and growing class of workers who can't make
better lives for themselves.

The decades that have led to our present-day dysfunction share important
similarities with the decades leading to the Civil War. Then as now, a
growing economy served to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. The
number of millionaires per capita quadrupled from 1800 to 1850, while
the relative wage declined by nearly 50 percent from the 1820s to the
1860s, just as it has in recent decades. Biological data from the time
suggest that the average American's quality of life declined
significantly. From 1830 to the end of the century, the average height
of Americans fell by nearly two inches, and average life expectancy at
age 10 decreased by eight years during approximately the same period.

This [**popular immiseration** [stirred up social
**strife**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could be seen in urban riots.
From 1820 to 1825, when times were good, only one riot occurred in which
at least one person was killed. But in the five years before the Civil
War, 1855 to 1860, American cities experienced no fewer than 38 such
riots. We [see a **similar pattern** today]{.underline}. In the run-up
to the Civil War, this frustration manifested politically, in part as
anti-immigrant populism, epitomized by the Know-Nothing Party. Today
this strain of populism has been resurrected by Donald Trump.

Strife grew among elites too. The newly minted millionaires of the 19th
century, who made their money in manufacturing rather than through
plantations or overseas trade, chafed under the rule of the southern
aristocracy, as their economic interests diverged. To protect their
budding industries, the new elites favored high tariffs and state
support for infrastructure projects. The established elites---who grew
and exported cotton, and imported manufactured goods from
overseas---strongly opposed these measures. The southern slaveholders'
grip on the federal government, the new elites argued, prevented
necessary reforms in the banking and transportation systems, which
threatened their economic well-being.

As the elite class expanded, the supply of desirable government posts
flattened. Although the number of U.S. representatives grew fourfold
from 1789 to 1835, it had shrunk by mid-century, just as more and more
elite aspirants received legal training---then, as now, the chief route
to political office. Competition for political power intensified, as it
has today.

Those were cruder times, and intra-elite conflict took very violent
forms. In Congress, incidences and threats of violence peaked in the
1850s. The brutal caning that Representative Preston Brooks of South
Carolina gave to Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the Senate
floor in 1856 is the best-known such episode, but it was not the only
one. In 1842, after Representative Thomas Arnold of Tennessee
"reprimanded a pro-slavery member of his own party, two Southern
Democrats stalked toward him, at least one of whom was armed with a
bowie knife," the historian Joanne Freeman recounts. In 1850, Senator
Henry Foote of Mississippi pulled a pistol on Senator Thomas Hart Benton
of Missouri. In another bitter debate, a pistol fell out of a New York
representative's pocket, nearly precipitating a shoot-out on the floor
of Congress.

**Sullivan '24** \[Joseph, Writer for Dividedwefall, "America at a
Crossroads: Is Another Civil War Possible?" Divided We Fall, 4 Sept.

A [[civil war in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is
[extremely unlikely ]{.mark}]{.underline}and, if it did emerge, would
not look like Mr. Sullivan's fever dream of environmental vigilantes and
libertarian crypto rebels. The reality is the U.S., despite a coarsening
of political discourse and hand-wringing about the end of democracy,
possesses structural advantages that inhibit the emergence of the kind
of violence that would qualify as a "civil war." And if it did come to
pass, more salient trends in American society would define its contours,
not bespoke ideologies like radical environmentalism and cryptocurrency
fantasy. Political scientists generally define civil wars as violent
political conflicts between two or more organized groups within a
country that result in more than 1,000 battle deaths per year. That's a
scale of political violence that [[requires serious organization]{.mark}
on the part of would-be rebels or revolutionaries. The [U.S]{.mark}. Has
[Survived Past Political Upheavals]{.mark} History is not always a guide
to the future, but it's all we have for making]{.underline} predictions.
History shows us that for wealthy democracies such as the U.S., the risk
of civil war is negligible. Civil [wars [need soldiers, which
means]{.mark} they need a pool of [desperate and frustrated young
men]{.mark}. The crisis of alienation afflicting American society has
produced stochastic terrorism in the form of mass shooters,
but]{.underline} not organized groups committed to violent rebellion.
The U.S. has seen periods of intense political upheaval and political
violence, but only once has it fallen into a civil war. The 1960s and
1970s saw high-profile assassinations of political leaders, violent
action by revolutionaries of The Weather Underground, the Symbionese
Liberation Army, and the Black Panthers, and riots in major cities
during the "long, hot summer" of 1967. Yet we don't refer to this period
of U.S. history as a civil war. While intense, the scale of violence
didn't meet the threshold for that designation. Many factors in U.S.
politics today, from deep polarization to the wide availability of guns,
herald a potential return to the political violence of the 60s and 70s.
With the recent assassination attempt of presidential candidate Donald
Trump, we may be in the early stages of such a resurgence. However, then
as now, the U.S. is an extremely wealthy country without the structural
foundations for civil war. The Necessary Ingredients for a U.S. Civil
War Mr. Sullivan points to radical environmentalism and anti-state
cryptocurrency enthusiasm as ideologies that could inspire a civil war.
But ideology alone is insufficient. Nor are these ideologies new.
So-called "ecoterrorism" was more prevalent in the 1980s than today;
anti-state ideologues have tussled with the FBI from Waco in 1993 to the
Bundy Standoff in 2014. It's not the radicalism of an ideology that
determines the likelihood of war; it's the ability of the ideology to
create organized groups committed to and prepared for sustained violent
action. The only type of group in the U.S. today that could conceivably
meet that bar is the right-wing militia movement. Even then, a major
exogenous shock would be needed to turn militias into forces capable of
carrying out large-scale organized violence. Rhetoric Is Making the
Unfathomable a Possibility By Joseph Sullivan -- Senior Advisor, The
Lindsey Group History has inserted itself into the debate between myself
and Mr. Blinkinsop. On July 13, 2024, two weeks after I submitted my
draft for this debate, a bullet fired by a twenty-year-old's rifle came
within inches of assassinating former President Trump. If anything, this
has raised the specter of civil war. A Civil War Unlike the Past Mr.
Blinkinsop and I agree that if civil war breaks out in the United
States, it will not look or feel like the type of civil war seen in
history textbooks where warring militaries divide territory and
partition a country under new flags. However, Mr. Blinkinsop's
definition of civil war is an armed conflict that causes 1,000 or more
battle deaths per year. The United States had around 25,000 homicides in
2022. Would it be hard to imagine President Trump's assassination
causing a rise in homicides of 4 percent or more, creating 1,000
additional homicides over the level of 2022 (the last year with the
relevant data from the CDC)? Not at all. Homicides increased during the
pandemic by 5,500 (over 20 percent) from 2019 to 2020, and by 1,500 (6
percent) from 2020 to 2021. If Trump had been assassinated, might it
have raised political tensions and frayed the social fabric as much as
the pandemic and associated lockdowns, causing a similar rise in
murders? The answer seems far more likely to be yes. Would these deaths
qualify as the "battle" deaths that constitute a civil war?
Interpretations would vary. But it would be hard to dismiss an answer of
"no" due only to the absence of a battlefield that looks like Syria in
2014 or Yugoslavia in 1991. A Series of Missteps with Serious
Consequences The novelty of the attempted Trump assassination may,
however, demand that political scientists introduce a new concept for
civil war that includes the origins of the violence. Consider that a
series of avoidable errors on the part of the Biden Administration's
Secret Service, including denying the Trump campaign's requests for
additional protection, might have resulted in the death of the
President's main political opponent, after a litany of political and
legal attempts to remove Trump from the race. A generous interpretation
would be that Biden's party mismanaged the government's resources, but
more radical interpretations would accuse Biden directly, claiming he
caused the assassination of the candidate poised to defeat him at the
polls, triggering large-scale violence. On this, Mr. Blinkinsop and I
disagree: the July 13th assassination attempt underscores the likelihood
that armed violence comes from the Left, which increasingly uses
apocalyptic language to characterize its political opponents. The Biden
campaign paused ads to this effect after July 13th, in apparent
recognition that its attempts to paint Trump as an enemy of democracy
contributed to the climate that produced the assassination attempt.
Unless the apocalyptic rhetoric stops, the apocalyptic scenario of a
civil war, or something like it, will continue to be as fathomable in
the United States as it was on July 13th. Organized Political Violence
Is a Necessary Ingredient for Civil War By Andrew Blinkinsop -- Ph.D.
Candidate, University of California, Berkeley Mr. Sullivan highlights
the recent attempted assassination of former President Trump as evidence
for two main assertions: that the social landscape of contemporary
America is fraying, brittle, and prone to explosions of political
violence, and that it is the political left with its "apocalyptic
rhetoric" that is the prime culprit in these trends. On the first point
we agree, though we disagree about how to classify the violence. On the
second point, we disagree. Investigations are ongoing, but thus far the
evidence does not suggest that Thomas Matthew Crooks, the teenager who
attempted to assassinate Trump, was motivated by left-wing ideas. His
phone revealed searches for both Trump and Biden rallies, and he left
behind no obvious political justification for his act. Rather than an
example of dangerous ideological currents on the Left, the attempted
Trump assassination exemplifies a different pattern: stochastic, or
"lone wolf" terrorism. Crooks was not participating in organized
political violence, he was acting alone and without a discernible
ideological motive. Politically Motivated Deaths in the U.S. Are
Uncommon Stochastic terrorism and wider violence are a problem. Compared
to other high-income countries, the U.S. is a more violent country, with
seven times the homicide rate and 25 times the gun homicide rate. But
murder is not civil war. Mr. Sullivan's imagined hypothetical, in which
the homicide rate jumps by over 1,000 deaths after a successful
assassination, would also not constitute civil war. Crime rates are
complex outcomes, and pinning down a specific cause is no easy task. Mr.
Sullivan's hypothetical could be cast as civil war only if the deaths
could be traced to organized political violence. Such politically
motivated deaths remain very rare. In 2020, the year of the
**[[largest]{.underline}]{.mark}** street
**[[protest]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S.
**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[25]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Americans were **[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark}** during protests and
political unrest. The infamous **[[Unite the Right
rally]{.underline}]{.mark}** and counter-protest in Charlottesville in
2017 resulted in [[one death.]{.mark} The assault on the Capitol on
January 6th, 2021, was linked to several deaths. The Antifa-[Proud
Boys]{.mark} street [battle]{.mark}s in Portland and other cities have
resulted in at most [a few deaths]{.mark}. These numbers are
no]{.underline}t anywhere near the 1,000-per-year threshold. Both Sides
Are Guilty of Extreme Rhetoric I share Mr. Sullivan's worry about
increasing political violence in the U.S., and the apocalyptic rhetoric
that could fuel it. Elected Democrats don't even seem to believe their
own insistence that Trump is a "threat to democracy" who wants to become
a dictator. Rising stars like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer are
keeping their powder dry for 2028, clearly expecting democracy to
survive until then. However, apocalypticism is by no means confined to
Democrats. Trump regularly claims that if he loses in 2024, we "won't
have a country anymore." Blaming the July 13th assassination attempt on
the Left, which both Mr. Sullivan and other Republicans have indulged
in, further contributes to apocalypticism rather than lowering the
temperature. But again, extreme rhetoric or radical ideologies do not
[themselves produce civil war. The reality is that the [U.S]{.mark}. is
too wealthy, too comfortable, and [too socially alienated to
produce]{.mark} committed civil [warriors. ]{.mark}]{.underline}

CHINA yesterday accused the White House of 'bullying practices' after
Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} imposed 104 per cent duties on
Chinese goods into the US in an attempt to destroy the Chinese Workers
State. Trump says the [[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark} are 'explosive' and
will boost the US economy, but experts warn they will **[[push up
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}** for workers. There has already been
'aggressive' selling of long term US government bonds. China's foreign
affairs spokesperson said that the Chinese people's 'legitimate right to
development must not be deprived' by huge charges on Chinese goods.
China's Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian accused the US of 'bullying
practices', and urged Trump's administration to 'demonstrate an attitude
of equality, mutual respect and reciprocity', in order to resolve the
dispute through dialogue. Knowing that a dialogue was not enough, Jian
added if Trump 'insists' on [[provoking]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[trade
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, '**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** will be
compelled to **[[fight to the end]{.underline}]{.mark}**'. The trade war
is now on! Already in this worldwide struggle, 60 of America's biggest
'[[trading partners]{.underline}]{.mark}' have been [[hit with
**high**]{.underline}]{.mark}er US **[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
goods. They include 104 per cent levies on Chinese products -- a figure
effectively doubled overnight by President Trump after Beijing refused
to back down on its pledge to retaliate. The message from Beijing is
that they can defend themselves and will retaliate. The deepening trade
war has provoked further turmoil on the world's stock markets -- in the
last hour, shares in Europe slumped again, following similar falls
across Asia. Speaking at a Republican Party dinner yesterday, President
Trump said the tariffs were 'going to be legendary, in a positive way.
Many countries ... have ripped us off left and right, but now it's our
turn to do the ripping,' he said. Trump added, describing the tariffs as
'somewhat explosive' and 'amazing', claiming that import tariffs were
already generating 'almost \$2bn (£1.5bn) a day' for the US. In the UK
on Wednesday, the main stock market of the country's biggest companies
opened 2.5 per cent down. The trading war initiated by Trump has
'contributed to a material increase in the [[risk
to]{.underline}]{.mark} global growth' and **[[financial
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Bank of England commented. It
added that US tariffs and other countries' response also increases
'uncertainty ... for inflation globally' while the cost of government
borrowing has 'fallen in response to the US announcement'. The Bank
added that it 'maintained its judgement' that UK banks could support
households and businesses even if the economy turned 'substantially
worse than expected'. The South Korean Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo
spoke to reporters after arriving in the US to try to negotiate a tariff
deal with Donald Trump's team. The country, which sells large numbers of
cars and electronics to the US, is being hit with 25 per cent blanket
tariffs. Seoul does not want to go down the Chinese road of retaliatory
tariffs, and get into a trade war with America. Instead, it's hoping to
convince Trump to lower tariffs by promising to buy more and invest more
in the US. On Tuesday night, Trump took a call with acting president Han
Duck-soo for the first time. Trump described the call as 'great'. He
also insisted that South Korea's trade surplus was 'tremendous and
unsustainable'. Trump actually demanded more payments from South Korea
for the 'big time military protection' Washington provides Seoul. There
is no compromise to be made. China yesterday responded by increasing its
tarrif on the USA from 50 per cent to 84 per cent. [[Capitalism

[Existing IPCC scenarios are part of a conservative process, designed to
conform to the prerequisites of the capitalist economy, which builds
continued]{.underline} economic [growth]{.underline} in the wealthy
countries into all scenarios while excluding any substantial changes in
social relations. The sole device relied upon in such climate modeling
is to assume price-induced shifts in technology. Existing
[scenarios]{.underline} thus necessarily [rely heavily on negative
emissions technologies]{.underline}, such as Bioenergy and Carbon
Capture and Sequestration (BECCS) and Direct Carbon Air Capture (DAC),
that do not presently exist at scale and cannot be instituted within the
prescribed timeline, while also presenting enormous ecological hazards
in themselves. This [emphasis on essentially nonexistent technologies
that are themselves environmentally destructive]{.underline} (given
their enormous land, water, and energy requirements) has been
[challenged by scientists within the IPCC itself]{.underline}. Thus, in
the original Summary for Policymakers for the mitigation report, part 3
of AR6, the scientists authoring the report agreed that such
technologies are not viable in a reasonable time frame and suggested
that [low-energy solutions based on popular mobilization might offer the
best hope of carrying out the massive ecological transformations now
required. All of this,]{.underline} however, was [excluded]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} the [final]{.underline} published Summary for
Policymakers as [determined by governments]{.underline}, as part of the
normal IPCC process, which allows for censorship of the scientists.^15^

[Price-induced technological solutions,]{.underline} which would
[allow]{.underline} continued economic [growth]{.underline} and the
perpetuation of current social relations, do not exist on anything like
the required scale and tempo. Hence, major socioeconomic changes in the
mode of production and consumption are needed, running counter to the
reigning political-economic hegemony. "Three decades of complacency,"
Anderson writes, "has meant that [technology on its own cannot now cut
emissions fast enough]{.underline}." There is thus a [drastic need for
low-energy solutions based on changes in relations of production and
consumption that also address deep inequalities]{.underline}. The
necessary reductions in emissions are "[only possible by re-allocating
society's productive capacity away from enabling the private luxury of a
few and austerity for everyone else, and toward wider public prosperity
and private sufficiency]{.underline}. For most people, tackling climate
change will bring multiple benefits, from affordable housing to secure
employment. But for those few of us who have disproportionately
benefited from the status quo," Anderson insists, "it means a profound
reduction in how much energy we use and stuff we accumulate."^16^

[A degrowth]{.underline}/deaccumulation [approach]{.underline} [that
challenges accumulative society]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[primacy of economic growth is crucial]{.underline} here. [Social
provisioning for human needs and sharp reductions in
inequality]{.underline} are [essential parts of a shift]{.underline} to
a low-energy transformation in the economy and the elimination of
ecologically destructive forms and scales of output. In this way, the
lives of most people can be improved both economically and ecologically.
Accomplishing this, however, [requires going against the logic of
capitalism and the mythology of a self-regulating market
system]{.underline}. Such a radical transformation can only be
[achieved]{.underline} [by]{.underline} [introducing]{.underline}
significant levels of [economic and social planning]{.underline},
through which, if carried to its fullest, the associated producers would
work together in a rational way to regulate the labor and production
process governing the social metabolism of humanity and nature as a
whole.

Classical nineteenth-century socialism in the work of Karl Marx and
Frederick Engels saw the need for the institution of
collective *planning* in response to the ecological and social
contradictions of capitalism, as well as its economic ones. Engels's
analysis insisted on the need for socialist planning to overcome the
ecological rift between town and country, while Marx's theory of
metabolic rift, operating on a more general level, insisted on the need
for sustainable human development.

Planning has been crucial to all economies, both capitalist and
socialist, in times of war. Giant, [monopolistic
corporations]{.underline} have [themselves instituted of their own
accord]{.underline} what economist John Kenneth Galbraith called a
"[planning system]{.underline}," though [operating]{.underline}
largely [within]{.underline}, [rather]{.underline}
[than between]{.underline}, multinational
conglomerates.^17^ Nevertheless, the whole idea of [economic
planning]{.underline} is seen, in the received ideology, as
[antagonistic to the capitalist market]{.underline} and has been
effectively banned from public discussion---declared unworkable and a
form of despotism---following the triumph of capitalism in the Cold War
and the demise of the Soviet Union.

This is now rapidly changing. As French economist Jacques Sapir recently
noted, "plan and planning are back in fashion," due to the internal and
external contradictions of the capitalist market system.^18^ It is now
clear that, [without]{.underline} the [return of planning and
environmental-state regulation of the economy in a context of the
degrowth]{.underline}/deaccumulation of capital, there is [zero
possibility of successfully addressing the present planetary emergency
and ensuring the continuation of industrialized society and the survival
of the human population.]{.underline}

Marx, Engels, and Ecological Planning

Marx and Engels were always reluctant to provide what Marx called
"recipes...for the cook-shops of the future," demarcating what forms
socialist and communist societies should take. As Engels put it, "to
speculate on how a future society might organize the distribution of
food and dwellings leads directly to *utopia*."^19^ Nevertheless, they
were clear throughout their writings that the reorganization of
production under a society of associated producers would involve
cooperative labor organized in accordance with a common plan.

In *Principles of Communism*, Engels wrote that in the future society,
"all...branches of production" would be "operated by society as a whole,
that is, for the common account, according to a common plan, with the
participation of all members of society." The same approach was adopted
by Marx and Engels in the *Communist Manifesto*, where they singled out
the need for the "extension of factories and instruments of production
owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and
the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common
plan."^20^ Here the problem of ending the division between town and
country through the dispersal of the population more evenly across the
country, so that it was no longer concentrated in the large industrial
cities separating the urban and rural populations, was central to their
idea of a common plan.

Much of Marx's analysis in the *Grundrisse* focused on the need for the
"[economy of time, \[which\] in accord with the planned distribution of
labour time among the various branches"]{.underline} of industry,
constituted "the first economic law on the basis of communal
production."^21^ As he wrote to Engels on January 8, 1868: "No form of
society can prevent the working time at the disposal of society from
regulating production one way or another. So long, however, as this
[regulation]{.underline} is [accomplished not by the direct and
conscious control of society over its working time]{.underline}---which
is possible only with common ownership---but [by]{.underline} the
[movement of commodity prices, things remain as you have already quite
aptly described]{.underline} them in *Deutsch-Französische
Jahrbücher*"---referring to Engels's "Outlines of a Critique of
Political Economy" of 1843.^22^ This early work of Engels was greatly
admired by Marx. In his 1843 "Summary of Engels's 'Outlines,'" Marx
emphasized "the split between the land and the human being," and thus,
the alienation of nature, as the external basis of capitalist
production.

In *Capital*, Marx argued with respect to planning that the part of the
social product destined for the reproduction of the means of production
is properly collective while the other part, devoted to consumption, is
divided among consumers individually. How a given society carries out
this all-important division is the key to the entire mode of production
and reflects the historical development of society itself. [Under
socialism, labor-time would necessarily be apportioned "in accordance
with a definite social plan" that "maintains the correct proportion
between the different functions of labour and the various needs of the
associations" of labor.]{.underline} This was only possible when "the
practical relations of everyday life between man and man, and man and
nature generally present themselves...in a rational form" as a result of
historical development, making possible "production by freely associated
\[individuals\]...under their conscious and planned control."^23^ As
Marx explained in response to the Paris Commune, ["cooperative
societies" in the future society would "regulate national production
upon a common plan]{.underline}."^24^ The fact that such planning was
both an *economic* problem and an *ecological* one was clear throughout
his work.

"Freedom in this sphere," a higher society, Marx wrote in the third
volume of *Capital*, "can consist only in this, that socialized man, the
associated producers, govern the human metabolism with nature in a
rational way, bringing it under their collective control...accomplishing
it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy
and appropriate for their human nature."^25^ The historical record of
human-caused ecological destruction in forms such as deforestation and
desertification, embodied, for Marx, unconscious "socialist tendencies"
since demonstrating the *necessity of social control*.^26^

However, it was Engels in *Anti-Dühring* who most explicitly grounded
the [need for planning in relation to environmental
conditions]{.underline}. For Engels, it was [the negative externalities
of capitalist production]{.underline}, associated with the division
between town and country, a permanent housing problem, [and]{.underline}
the [destruction of both the natural as well as social conditions of
working-class existence, that most clearly called for large-scale
planning]{.underline}. Modern industry itself, he argued, needed
"relatively pure water," as opposed to what existed in "the factory
town" that "transforms all water into stinking manure."^27^ Extending
themes present in both *The Condition of the Working Class in
England* and the *Communist Manifesto*, he declared:

Abolition of the antithesis between town and country is not merely
possible. [It has become a direct necessity of industrial production
itself, just as it has become a necessity for agricultural production
and, besides, of public health]{.underline}. The present poisoning of
the air, water and land can be put an end to only by the fusion of town
and country; and only such fusion will change the situation of the
masses languishing in the towns, and enable their excrement to be used
for the production of plants instead of for the production of
disease.... The abolition of the separation of town and country is
therefore not utopian...in so far as it is conditioned on the most equal
distribution possible of modern industry over the whole country.^28^

Organizing production collectively according to a "[social
plan]{.underline}," Engels argued, would "[end
the]{.underline}...[subjection of men to their own means of production"
characteristic of capitalist commodity
production.]{.underline}^29^ Under [socialism]{.underline}, it would of
course "still be necessary for society to know how much labour each
article of consumption requires for its production." It would then "have
to [arrange its plan of production in accordance with its means of
production,]{.underline} which include, in particular, its
labour-powers. The useful effects of the various articles of consumption
compared with one another and with the quantities of labour required for
their production, will in the end determine the plan."^30^ But beyond
the rational and economical use of labor within industry[, planning
would be necessary to overcome the exhaustion of the soil in the country
and the related pollution of the town.]{.underline} "Only a society
which makes it possible for its productive forces to dovetail
harmoniously into each other on the basis of one single vast plan,"
Engels wrote, "can allow industry to be distributed over the whole
country in the way best adapted to its own development, and to the
maintenance and development of the other elements of production."^31^

[[Capitalism]{.mark} is **[destroying]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline} [planet]{.underline}]{.mark}. That's the conclusion
many climate activists are drawing. But understanding why capitalism is
destroying the planet is more complex. [What compels capitalists
to]{.underline} [[constantly]{.mark} [search]{.mark} [out profit]{.mark}
to the detriment of the planet's]{.underline} capacity to support
[life?]{.underline}

Karl [Marx]{.underline} [said this compulsion flowed from **competitive
[accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Capitalists compete]{.underline}
with each other [to maximize]{.underline} their [profits]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} are forced to [plough back into
[production]{.mark}]{.underline} most of the [wealth they extract from
workers]{.underline}. The compulsion to accumulate arises from the
competition faced by capitalists. [Unless they constantly innovate and
develop production methods]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} face
[los]{.underline}ing out [to their competitors]{.underline}---resulting
in possible bankruptcy.

[This **traps**]{.underline} the [capitalists]{.underline}---[if they do
not **endlessly grow** their capital, they will disappear]{.underline}.
The laws of capitalist production, Marx said, are "felt by each
individual capitalist, as external coercive laws." They compel them "to
keep constantly extending" their capital, to preserve it. The only way
to extend capital is "by means of progressive accumulation."

So, [[capitalism]{.mark} is a [system]{.mark} [of endless]{.mark}
[growth]{.mark} that leads to the natural world being **systematically**
degraded.]{.underline} [Production]{.underline} relies on a relationship
between the natural world and human labour, [and growth requires labor
to be exploited.]{.underline}

[The drive for growth destroys]{.underline} "the original sources of all
wealth---[the soil and the laborer]{.underline}," Marx said. Many
environmental activists instinctively grasp this concept. The slogan,
"[You [**cannot** have]{.mark} **infinite** growth [on a **finite**
planet]{.mark}]{.underline}," [is popular within the
movement]{.underline}. It epitomizes the sense that
[capitalism]{.underline} [operates beyond the means which the planet can
provide]{.underline}.

[In the last decade]{.underline} [this has led to the]{.underline}
development of the "[**[degrowth]{.mark}** movement".]{.underline} It is
a movement with a multitude of strands. But it's one that almost
[universally [stands]{.mark} [for]{.mark} social and
[environmental]{.mark} justice]{.underline}, equality and [a
[system]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [sustainably
organizes]{.mark}]{.underline} the impact of [human society on the
planet]{.underline}.

Schmelzer, Vetter and Vansintjan argue that, contrary to popular myth,
the vast majority of those who argue for degrowth start from the need to
build a world of equity and equality. Degrowth is not about austerity
and a lack of development for the majority. This clarification is
important.

Working class people have already suffered under austerity. And many
socialists and trade unionists are concerned that ordinary people will,
through "degrowth" and cutting back, be made to pay for capitalism's
destruction of the environment.

But the authors emphasize that proponents of [degrowth]{.underline} "are
[[**fundamentally critical** of growth]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**[capitalism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[industrialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and want to overcome other
forms of domination". They "[advocate a [radical restructuring
of]{.mark} the [economy]{.mark} in industrialized
countries]{.underline}, requiring the [selective [downscaling]{.mark}
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} certain [industries and
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}." At the same time this means expanding
public services like health, education and transport.

The book is loosely split into three parts. The first explains what
capitalist growth is. Here the authors refer to various thinkers, but it
is worth noting that they draw heavily on Marx's ideas on accumulation.
The second part explores how a [[growth]{.mark}-based economy [leads
to]{.mark} [environmental]{.mark} [destruction]{.mark},
[exploitation]{.mark} and oppression]{.underline}. Finally, the authors
[explore]{.underline} their [vision for a post-capitalist, degrowth
society.]{.underline}

[Such a society has undergone a "**[democratic]{.mark} process of
[transformation]{.mark}**" and]{.underline} "[[enables]{.mark}
**[global]{.mark} [ecological]{.mark}** [justice]{.mark}" which
"transforms and reduces its material metabolism]{.underline}." Such a
society would see the [strengthening of "social justice and
self-determination]{.underline}" and would strive "for a good life for
all, under the conditions of this changed metabolism". The degrowth
society would [redesign "institutions and infrastructure]{.underline} so
that they are [not dependent on growth]{.underline} and continued
expansion for their functioning."

Clearly, socialists would agree with these aims. In particular I was
impressed by the authors' use of the concept of "metabolism" to explore
how societies related to the world around them. It's an approach used by
Marx and has been developed by Marxist writers such John Bellamy Foster
to show how [capitalism has broken the links between humans and nature,
which enabled societies to function sustainably.]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--Degrowth\-\--2NC

#### Transition to degrowth [now]{.underline} is key. 

**Foster '23** \[John; July 1; Professor of sociology, economist;
"Planned Degrowth: Ecosocialism and Sustainable Human Development";
https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/planned-degrowth/#:\~:text=A%20degrowth/deaccumulation%20approach%20that,well%20as%20its%20economic%20ones.\]

[Planned degrowth]{.underline} or deaccumulation [and a shift to
sustainable human development is now unavoidable]{.underline} in the
wealthiest countries, whose per capita [ecological]{.underline}
[footprints]{.underline} [are non-sustainable on a planetary basis,
if]{.underline} organized [civilization is to survive]{.underline}. The
scale and tempo of the necessary ecological-energy transformation, as
emphasized in scientific reports on climate change and other planetary
boundaries, indicate that [in order to avert disaster a revolutionary
transformation of the entire system of production and consumption must
be implemented]{.underline} under the principle "Better Smaller But
Better."^110^ Hence, the core capitalist/imperialist countries, which
constitute the main source of the problem, must seek a "prosperous way
down," focusing on use value rather than exchange value.^111^ This
requires moving toward much lower levels of energy consumption and
gravitating to equal global per capita shares while simultaneously
zeroing out carbon emissions.

At the same time, the poorer countries with low ecological footprints
have to be allowed to develop in a general process that
includes *contraction* in throughput of energy and materials in the rich
countries and the *convergence* of per capita consumption in physical
terms in the world as a whole.^112^ The [downsizing of the rich
economies will require a massive shift to sustainable technologies,
including solar and wind energy.]{.underline} But no existing
technologies by themselves can come anywhere near to solving the climate
problem in the required timeline, not to mention addressing the
planetary emergency in its entirety, while allowing for the [continued
unlimited exponential accumulation and maldistribution required by
capitalism]{.underline}.^113^

What is objectively necessary at this point in human history is
therefore a revolutionary [transformation in social relations governing
production, consumption, and distribution.]{.underline} This means a
dramatic [shift]{.underline} [away from the system of monopoly capital,
exploitation, expropriation, waste, and the endless drive to
accumulation.]{.underline}1^14^ In its place, a revolutionary humanity
based in the working population---an emergent environmental
[proletariat]{.underline}---will need to [demand]{.underline} [a new
social formation that provides for the basic needs of all of the
population, followed by community needs, including the developmental
needs of all individuals]{.underline}.^115^ This will be made
[possible]{.underline} [by]{.underline} qualitative [improvements in
work, an emphasis on useful labor]{.underline} and care work, along with
the sharing of abundant social wealth, itself the product of human
labor. A sustainable relation to the earth is an absolute requirement
without which there can be no human future. [All of this necessitates
going against the logic of capitalist accumulation in the present.
Economic planning]{.underline} will [need to be repurposed]{.underline},
not for economic growth or war on other countries, but in order [to
create a new set of social priorities aimed at human flourishing and a
sustainable social metabolism with the earth.]{.underline}

A "[socialist]{.underline} vision of the United States," Harry Magdoff
wrote in 1995, would [require decreases in the use of
energy]{.underline}, production of civilian cars, and government
subsidies to environmentally destructive firms. "A much simpler
lifestyle would be needed in the rich countries for the sake of
preserving the earth as a place of human existence." In order to achieve
this, "[growth would need to be curtailed]{.underline} or controlled."
It would be essential in such a system to focus on basic needs, such as
adequate and dignified housing for all. [War spending geared to
imperialism would have to cease]{.underline} and immigration
restrictions would need to be eliminated. All of this [requires social
and economic planning]{.underline}. [None of it could be achieved by
relying]{.underline} primarily [on]{.underline} the system of [market
prices]{.underline}, which invariably promotes inequality, environmental
destruction, war, and exclusion.^116^ As British sociologist Anthony
Giddens wrote in *The Politics of Climate Change*, "planning of some
sort is inevitable" in the face of the current planetary crisis.^117^

In the United States and other rich countries, the m[eans already exist
at present for such a massive, qualitative transformation of society in
line with social priorities]{.underline} and the needs of the oppressed
working class, while shifting away from imperialism and the global
oppression of "the wretched of the earth." This can be easily [seen by
pointing to the now trillion-dollar military budget]{.underline}, which
could be repurposed to carry out those changes in the energy
infrastructure necessary for human survival. But it can also be seen in
the rising levels of expropriation of surplus from the direct producers.
A study by RAND Corporation estimated that \$47 trillion (in 2018
dollars) was expropriated from the bottom 90 percent of the U.S.
population between 1980 and 2018, calculated based on what they would
have received if income had grown equitably within the economy over the
period. This exceeds the entire current value of the U.S. housing stock,
which in January 2022 was \$43 trillion dollars.^118^ At the base of
this [enormous social surplus is social labor, which needs to be
allocated on an economic and ecological basis, and no longer on the
basis of private accumulation]{.underline}.^119^

Even the most cursory examination of the wider waste and exploitation in
the system raises what Morris called the problem of "Useful
work *versus* Useless Toil."^120^ The [massive economic surplus arising
from social labor]{.underline}---measured not simply by profits,
interest, and rent, but also the waste, maldistribution, and elementary
irrationality of the system---[is already many times that which is
necessary to carry out the vast changes needed to create a society of
sustainable human development]{.underline}. It is
[capitalism]{.underline} itself that [imposes scarcity]{.underline} and
austerity on the population [in order to compel workers to sacrifice
their lives]{.underline} still further for an exploitative system, now
[threatening a planetary habitability crisis for all of
humanity]{.underline} along with innumerable other life forms.

### Alt\-\--Degrowth\-\--Solves Climate Change\-\--2NC

#### Socialist degrowth is the [only]{.underline} way to [solve]{.underline} climate change. 

**Molyneux '19** \[John; October 1; Leading member of SWD, University of
Portsmouth, Author of 'Leon Trotsky\'s Theory of Revolution'; "Socialism
is the only realistic solution to climate change",
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2019/10/01/why-socialism-is-the-only-realistic-solution-to-climate-change/\]

[Climate justice on a global scale is totally unthinkable without
socialism]{.underline}. Five hundred years ago the different continents
and regions of the world were roughly at the same level of economic
development; for example China was every bit as economically advanced as
Europe and India was seen as a rich country[. Centuries of capitalism,
slavery and imperialism]{.underline}, with the latter growing out of the
former, [created an immensely uneven world]{.underline}; industrial
production, wealth and [power]{.underline} [became]{.underline}
[concentrated]{.underline} in the so-called advanced 'West' ---
essentially Europe and North America---with poverty, starvation and lack
of industrial development concentrated in Asia, Africa and Latin
America, now usually called the Global South.

This pattern has changed somewhat in recent decades with massive
capitalist development in China and other parts of South and East Asia
but it is still a massive reality across much of the world. Historically
and still today the peoples of [Asia, Africa and Latin America have
contributed least to climate change]{.underline} but will be hugely
disproportionately affected by it. For example a [1.5-2 C global
temperature increase will be a death sentence for]{.underline} much of
[Africa]{.underline} because it will destroy their agriculture; melting
Himalayan glaciers and rising sea levels will utterly devastate the
deeply [impoverished]{.underline} Bangladesh.

This [cannot]{.underline} [be challenged]{.underline} or dealt with
[without socialist redistribution of wealth and socialist planning
internationally. Only socialist internationalism]{.underline} based on
the common interests of the world's working people could
[achieve]{.underline} such [international cooperation]{.underline}; any
[capitalist]{.underline} option, no matter how 'green' its intentions,
would [degenerate]{.underline} into national and international
[rivalries]{.underline} which would [destroy]{.underline} any coherent
international [planning]{.underline}.

Then there is the question of overall economic growth. There is a
growing view in the environmental movement that the idea of [continuous
economic growth is]{.underline} completely [unsustainable]{.underline}.
Greta Thunberg, in her speech to the UN, spoke of "fairy tales of
eternal economic growth."

But under capitalism stagnation or, even more so, de-growth is an
immediate crisis, a recession when it is short and a 'great depression'
when it is extended, spelling mass unemployment, poverty and austerity
(with the risk of fascism thrown in). This is [because capitalism has a
drive to growth built into its very fabric]{.underline}. [Achieving a
non-growth economy]{.underline} (measured in terms of GDP) or, should it
prove essential[, a de-growth in certain areas would also only be
possible on the basis of socialist planning combined with the popular
consent that would come from mass involvement in the democratic planning
process.]{.underline}

#### Only [state regulation]{.underline} under socialism can make renewables [successful]{.underline} in reducing climate change\-\--[perm fails]{.underline}.

**Empson '25** \[Martin; February 20; Editor of System Change Not
Climate Change, Author of Socialism or Extinction: The Meaning of
Revolution in a Time of Ecological Crisis "What's stopping a transition
to renewable energy?",
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2025/02/20/renewable-energy-why-the-price-is-wrong/\]

Christophers demonstrates --- conclusively and in detail --- that market
forces cannot deliver the sort of energy system that we need for a
sustainable future. Indeed, there is a "serious question mark" over
whether a single renewable energy facility anywhere has been built
without state support. [So **central** is **government** support that
for]{.underline} some [**renewable** energy companies]{.underline} [it
is the only thing that keeps them interested.]{.underline} Despite
politicians' rhetoric, the reality is that the supposedly private energy
system is dependent on government intervention:

"Even before the energy crisis of 2021-2 ... more than half of the
countries in the EU --- the very home, materially and symbolically, of
marketized electricity --- had some form of retail price control. And,
everywhere, the [**development** of renewables remains propped up by
**government support**]{.underline}."

Electricity is simply "not a suitable object for marketization and
profit generation," so [transitioning to a renewables-based energy
system will require **dumping** the **free-market** and putting it
all]{.underline} --- from power plants to energy grids --- **[under
state control]{.underline}**. Half-way houses, including [strategies
that rely on **profits** from **nationalised renewable** energy
companies, are **doomed**]{.underline}, because energy markets simply
[cannot work while trapped in]{.underline} the wider
**[capitalist]{.underline}** economic **[logic]{.underline}**.

While Christophers' analysis of the energy system is informative and
often insightful, the conclusions he draws are inadequate. Focusing
narrowly on electrical energy systems, Christophers concludes that their
weaknesses can be overcome by state control and ownership, so that
production decisions can be made with no concern for private profit.
Less profitable but greener technologies could then supplant fossil
fuels.

But even in that case, [**energy** production would still be
subordinated to the whims of **capitalist production** and the wider
**problems** caused by **capitalist accumulation**.]{.underline}

Muraca (2012) claims that [socially **sustainable** degrowth requires
justice and fairness]{.underline}. Justice is [essential]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} [the local community's point of view]{.underline} as
tourism should be redefined to acknowledge and place the rights of
locals above the rights of tourists as well as the the tourism
corporates (Higgins-Desbiolles et al., 2019, p. 1927). The focus should
be on [allowing]{.underline} local communities [to decide the number of
tourists and when]{.underline} and how to welcome them (Boluk et al.,
2021, p. 156). [In]{.underline} the context of [**Arctic**
tourism]{.underline}, this is also an [essential]{.underline} aspect
[from]{.underline} the [**indigenous** peoples' **p**oint **o**f
**v**iew]{.underline} [to avoid]{.underline} the
[exploitation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} indigenous
[cultures]{.underline} in tourism (see e.g. Viken & Müller, 2017).
Besides humans, the role of ecological, nonhuman actors, must be
acknowledged as well. This calls for a wider exploration of justice in
tourism research and tourism degrowth studies. [**Degrowth** must be
practised fairly, both from social and ecological
perspectives]{.underline}.

Along with degrowth debates, the [**socio-ecological**
perspective]{.underline} has [emerged]{.underline} [regarding
commodification]{.underline} where the socio-ecological services and
relations are transferred to a monetary value (Kallis et al., 2014, p.
4). According to Yaka (2018), [socio-ecological justice is a framework
that allows a **rethinking** of the relations between the human and
nonhuman worlds and frames it as a matter of justice]{.underline}. The
notion of socio-ecological justice is [supported by
struggles]{.underline}, especially the local communities and [indigenous
people have faced.]{.underline} These struggles [express the
relationality of human and nonhuman worlds as nature is not
separate]{.underline} "from communities but as a 'part of social
world'". Socio-ecological justice thus [builds a connection
between]{.underline} these two -- [human and nonhuman]{.underline} lives
(Yaka, 2018, pp. 362--363). Although ethics and justice (see e.g.,
Jamal, 2019; Fennell, 2006) have been addressed in tourism research, the
field still lags in developing justice principles in the context of the
destination's inhabitants and the well-being of the disadvantaged (Jamal
& Camargo, 2014, p. 26). Therefore, tourism and justice need more
exploration and as Higgins-Desbiolles (2010, p. 194) notes, tourism
academics have barely explored these two.

#### And overlaps with degrowth.

2.3 [Degrowth's relation to socio-ecological justice]{.underline}

Tourism and justice are closely linked to each other. According to
Higgins-Desbiolles (2010), some live in spectacular wealth and some in
abject poverty. [Tourism is not separate]{.underline} from this as
people [from more economically developed countries]{.underline} can
[enjoy]{.underline} their [holidays]{.underline} [while the less
developed countries host these tourists despite their
poverty]{.underline}. [International tourism includes]{.underline}
tensions of **[class polarization]{.underline}** which is the most
prominent in the relationship between tourists and their hosts. Tourists
[represent]{.underline} **[wealth]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[consumption]{.underline}**, and they [seek to have "exotic" or
"authentic" experiences often in poorer regions]{.underline}. Yet
tourism academics have barely explored tourism and justice
(Higgins-Desbiolles, 2010, pp. 194--195).

Justice is a complex notion as there are many theories related to it
(Jamal, 2019, p. 29). John Rawls' A Theory of Justice is one of the
established in this field. Rawls (1971) addresses that it does not
matter if laws and institutions are efficient and well-arranged if they
are unjust, they must be then reformed anyway. Truth and justice are
uncompromising as they are the first virtues of human activities.
Injustice is only tolerable when it is necessary to avoid even greater
injustice. Although Rawls sees justice as fairness, there are limits in
the theory of justice as it does not embrace all moral relationships,
such as animals and the rest of nature (Rawls, 1971, pp. 3--4 & 15).
Including nonhuman actors and their justice is important in tourism as
they are an essential part of the environment where tourism takes place
and where the human-animal relationships are explored (Grimwood et al.,
2018, p. 1).

In tourism research, the terms "just tourism", "justice tourism" and
"justice through tourism" have been explored. Hultsman (1995) explored
the ethical framework of "just tourism" and addressed that utilising
Leopold´s (1949) land ethic as a model for "just tourism" could be
considerable. Besides this framework, justice tourism, instead, is
considered a tourism type.19 Scheyvens (2002, p. 105--119) addresses
that this type of tourism develops solidarity between the tourists and
locals, promotes equal and respectful understanding and relationships,
and supports the self-determination of locals (as cited in
Higgins-Desbiolles, 2008, p. 354). Here the emphasis is more on the
framework of "justice through tourism" in which the different types of
justice tourism, such as responsible tourism, pro-poor tourism,
volunteer tourism and many others, take place (Guia, 2021, pp. 503 &
505).

In this study, the focus is on the [socio-ecological aspects of
justice]{.underline}. According to Gunnarsson- Östling and Svenfelt
(2018), socio-ecological justice is [a framework which understands the
**ecological basis** for sustaining societies and]{.underline}
highlights the [distribution of]{.underline} both the [resources and
impacts between different groups of society]{.underline}. They argue
that these [perspectives]{.underline} are [rarely discussed in
sustainability discourses]{.underline}. Gunnarsson-Östling and Svenfelt
define socio-ecological justice through eight different features. [In
socio-ecological justice,]{.underline} the [decisions should be based
on]{.underline} [how the society depends upon]{.underline} and
influences socio-ecological [systems]{.underline}. Therefore, conflicts
and uncertainty must be acknowledged. This [framework]{.underline}
[calls for just distribution of environmental goods and
services]{.underline}, not only between and within communities, but also
generations. This means that just distribution is defined and discussed
in a deliberative process and thus, [justice overlaps planning,
policies, production, and consumption]{.underline}. Here, the
[awareness]{.underline} of who is included and where power is located is
addressed [and]{.underline} the [decisions]{.underline} that [are made
are based on the inclusion of different groups, peoples, and
communities]{.underline}. They argue that these features are
anthropocentric as the power is distributed to humans and therefore,
they call for more future research on nonhuman entities and their
justice perspective (Gunnarsson-Östling & Svenfelt, 2018, p. 168).

Abdullah et al., (2022) address that the stakeholder that has the most
power is humans. Humans have control over tourism resources, such as how
to gain these benefits from tourism and distribute them. This
perspective is very anthropocentric as humans often dominate and
prioritise their benefits over other nonhuman actors. This results in
the marginalisation of nonhuman actors who have the least power within a
society and are generally excluded or banished from the society to the
margins which reinforces inequality among tourism stakeholders (Abdullah
et al., 2022, p. 2). The socio-ecological framework and the
marginalisation of nonhuman actors reflect the anthropocentric view over
tourism resources and "development" (see Higgins-Desbiolles, 2018). If
these are not questions of injustice, what20 is then? From this point of
view, assessing the justice of marginalised groups in tourism is
essential.

As Caton (2018) notes, [our societies are built on the **exploitation**
of other species and resources]{.underline}, that is [animals and
plants]{.underline}, which are utilised for [food, material, and
fuel]{.underline} (Caton, 2018, p. 196). [Socio-ecological
justice]{.underline} allows [rethinking the "relationality of human and
nonhuman worlds as a matter of justice]{.underline}" (Yaka, 2018, p.
360). This is essential in tourism as nonhumans are in dynamic
interaction with tourism (Grimwood et al., 2018, p. 1) and in general,
human life is dependent on water, land, and air (Yaka, 2018, p. 361). As
addressed in the introduction, here nonhuman actors are addressed as
"native" or "introduced" animals or plants (Reis & Shelton, 2018, p.
74). Humans are not the only actor in the environment: however, if the
focus is only on humans, it leads to ignoring other stakeholders, often
nonhumans, which leads to a non- [holistic understanding of the
environment]{.underline} (Abdullah et al., 2022, p. 2). Therefore,
including both [animate entities, such as animals, and inanimate
entities]{.underline}, [such as water and air, and their justice in
tourism does not make it only less anthropocentric]{.underline}
(Abdullah et al., 2022, p. 2) but also just. However, it is important to
keep in mind who defines nonhumans. If humans do it, it still represents
an anthropocentric view.

In tourism, these entities play various roles in the creation of tourist
experiences (Abdullah et al., 2022, p. 2). From the nonhuman point of
view, developing and managing tourism more holistically is essential.
Without nonhuman actors, tourism would be very different -- especially
in the Arctic regions where nature-based tourism is one of the most
popular forms of tourism. For instance, Äijälä (2022) conducted a study
regarding sled dog agencies in tourism landscapes. The study was in line
with the argument that animal workers have a stakeholder status in the
tourism industry (García-Rosell & Tallberg, 2021, as cited in Äijälä,
2022, p. 80) and that the sled dogs are a central part of creating
tourism landscapes. On the one hand, addressing the role of nonhuman
actors as stakeholders contributes to discussing how tourism could be
more just towards these nonhuman actors and their agencies in tourism.
On the other hand, it still raises a question about the justice of the
other nonhumans that are not directly shaped by the demand of tourism,
such as sled dogs. Sled dogs' agencies may therefore differ from other
nonhumans as their justice may have been recognised while the others may
not.21

According to Yaka (2018), the [difference between socio-ecological,
environmental, and ecological justice is that in environmental
justice]{.underline}, the [fair/unfair distribution of environmental
hazards/benefits]{.underline} is [stressed among humans]{.underline} and
in ecological justice, only the relationship with the nonhuman world is
emphasised. In socio-ecological justice, the [interconnection
between]{.underline} [these two, humanity and ecology,]{.underline} or
human and nonhuman worlds [is built]{.underline}. Simply, socio-
ecological justice is about recognising these two worlds, human and
nonhuman, and their rights to live and flourish together in an
environment which is free from "social and ecological destruction and
degradation" (Yaka, 2018, p. 363).

Besides the marginalisation of certain stakeholders in tourism, there
are also other factors that can be addressed in the context of
socio-ecological justice and tourism. [**Transportation** and **energy**
play a crucial role in the tourism secto]{.underline}r. According to
Grossmann et al., (2022, p. 1414), transport is the source of ecological
damage in multiple forms, and it is one of the hardest sectors to
decarbonise. In tourism, [transport-related emissions are expected to
grow **45 %**]{.underline} between the years 2016 and 2030. The biggest
emitter is Europe as the region is both the biggest origin and
destination of international tourism (UNWTO, 2019, p. 40). According to
Grossmann et al. (2022), [consuming fossil fuels instead of renewable
energy sources]{.underline} is not just from an ecological justice point
of view. [Massive changes in practices must take place]{.underline} if
tourism wants to represent itself as a "responsible" or "sustainable"
sector. The practices would include a [reduction in the need for
travelling]{.underline} (Grossmann et al., 2022, p. 1414). These are
seen as "[transport taboos]{.underline}" as they constitute a risk for
decision-makers as it would require a fundamental sociocultural change
which would cause "disorder" (Gössling & Cohen, 2014, p. 198). This
perspective reflects on the background of this study: is tourism growth
a taboo which cannot be criticized even in the era of global
environmental crisis?

What [brings **degrowth and justice** together]{.underline} then?
[Degrowth brings justice]{.underline} into the discussion in terms of
the economies of the North and South. Degrowth takes part in the
discussion [related to the "**overdeveloped** economies]{.underline}" of
the North [which exploits]{.underline} the [natural and human
resources]{.underline} of the South at a lower cost. Degrowth is needed
especially in the North where the consumption and demand for natural
resources should be reduced (Kallis et al., 2014, p. 5). Although
degrowth emerged from ecological and economic critiques of growth, the
focus has recently evolved towards concerns on democracy, justice, the
meaning of life and well-being (Flipo, 2007; Demaria et al., 2013, as
cited in Asara et al., 2015, p. 377). [Degrowth]{.underline} [aims to
increase22]{.underline} both [social justice and ecological
sustainability]{.underline} (Asara et al., 2015, p. 377). Muraca (2012,
p. 544) calls for just and fair degrowth but notes that the questions
regarding just degrowth are still open. On a more specific level, in the
context of socio-ecological justice, the socio- ecological perspective
has, along with degrowth debates, emerged regarding commodification
where the socio-ecological services and relations are transferred to a
monetary value (Kallis et al., 2014, p. 4). There is also an [increasing
emphasis on the **nexus** of socio-ecological among activists and
**social movements** (]{.underline}Grossmann et al., 2022, p. 1410)
which is also addressed in degrowth studies, as it has been proposed as
an activist-led science which originates from activism and social
movement (Demaria et al., 2013, p. 209). Both, [degrowth and socio-
ecological justice, tie these aspects together]{.underline} in this
study.

### Alt\-\--Degrowth\-\--AT: No Momentum\-\--2NC

#### Degrowth is part of our economic paradigm.

But Saitō's pretense to offer a path beyond our present political
impasses is misleading on at least two accounts. First, [the purpose of
capitalism is]{.underline}n't "growth," but value creation and [capital
accumulation]{.underline}, and capital [needs both
expansion and contraction]{.underline} to realize this process.
[As]{.underline} [the **previous [three decades]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
economic [stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}, austerity, an[d crisis
[indicate]{.mark}, **[degrowth]{.mark}** is already an
**[integral]{.mark} part** [of]{.mark} our [economic]{.mark}
[paradigm]{.mark},]{.underline} not a means of moving beyond it.

Second, [Saitō's conceptualization of "communism]{.underline}" entirely
[discards Marx's understanding]{.underline} of class struggle and, more
astonishingly, denies almost any role to the working class. This is
because for him, the [primary struggle is between capitalism and the
planet, rather than workers and capitalists]{.underline}. But in
abandoning the notion of a revolutionary working class as the agent of
change, [Saitō]{.underline} ends up [tacitly endorsing something
that]{.underline} sounds much like what [[we already have]{.mark}
today]{.underline}: [[an]{.mark} [elite-led green movement]{.mark}
[embraced]{.mark} [by]{.mark},]{.underline} rather than at odds with,
[the [capitalist]{.mark} class]{.underline}.

"The purpose of capitalism is not 'growth.'"

"[Degrowth is capitalism's own method of [deal]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark}
[overaccumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Saitō and degrowth proponents take for granted that the purpose of
capitalism is growth. But [among mainstream economists, the idea that
constant growth isn't]{.underline} just [possible]{.underline} but also
desirable only [dates back to the 1950s]{.underline}. Matthias
Schmelzer, himself a prominent degrowth advocate, makes this clear in
his 2016 book, The Hegemony of Growth. As [Schmelzer
admits]{.underline}, [economists]{.underline} [had long understood that
capitalism goes through cyclical periods of **boom and
bust**]{.underline}, expansion and contraction, [growth and
degrowth]{.underline}. Perhaps more important, despite paying lip
service to the ideology of growth, [most of the [ruling]{.mark}
[class]{.mark} today tacitly [accepts]{.mark} that [degrowth]{.mark} and
austerity [defined]{.mark} the economic **[reality]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
the [past]{.mark} **30 to [40 years]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[AMERICANS]{.mark} WHO COULDN'T defeat]{.underline} President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} [in the voting booth are planning on]{.underline}
Friday to **[[fight back]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [with]{.underline}
their [pocketbooks]{.underline}. 

The [People's Union USA,]{.underline} a movement led by a former drum
instructor John Schwarz, [organized a 24-hour "**[economic]{.mark}
[blackout]{.mark}**" that calls on American **[consumers]{.mark}** to
[make]{.mark} [no purchases]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially from major
retail, gas, or fast food companies. [If]{.underline}
[people]{.underline} [need]{.underline} to buy [essentials]{.underline},
they are [urged to shop at]{.underline} [local]{.underline}, small
[businesses]{.underline}.

Schwarz said the [boycott]{.underline} is [meant to **[send]{.mark} [a
message]{.mark}** to "the elite]{.underline}" [that]{.underline}
[everyday]{.underline} [people hold the economic power]{.underline} and
[to]{.underline} "[[expose]{.underline}]{.mark}" the
[corrupt]{.underline}ion of [[corporations]{.underline}]{.mark},
industries, and politicians. [Future]{.underline} weeklong
[boycotts]{.underline} [targeting Amazon, Nestlé, Target, and Walmart
are planned from March until July]{.underline}. 

"[Corporations profit off of our labor while keeping wages]{.underline}
[low]{.underline}, [banks]{.underline} **[steal]{.underline}**
[billions]{.underline} through [inflation]{.underline} [and predatory
policies]{.underline}, politicians accept bribes disguised as donations
while ignoring the people," Schwarz said in a viral video posted on
Instagram. "They have [**[taken everything]{.mark}** from]{.underline}
[us]{.underline} [while]{.underline} [convincing us we should be
grateful of the **[scraps]{.mark}**. And that **[ends
now]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

[Consumer-led boycotts]{.underline} aren't a new phenomena. In fact,
they [span decades]{.underline} [and have grown]{.underline}
[along]{.underline}side an increasingly popular theory and **[[social
movement]{.underline}]{.mark}** similarly [aiming to [wrest]{.mark}
[control away]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from corporations]{.mark}
and]{.underline} put it [in the hands of the people]{.underline}.

Rooted in the work of American and European political theorists of the
1970s, the "**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [movement criticizes a
capitalist system that]{.underline} [seeks unending growth and
profit]{.underline}, which has [led]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[ecological and environmental ruin]{.underline} such as the impacts of
climate change. Instead, it a[dvocates for a system that
[prioritizes]{.mark}]{.underline} the needs of [[the]{.mark} planet and
its [people]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as [[housing, education, and
health]{.underline} [care]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Jason
Hickel, a leading advocate of degrowth and author of "Less is More: How
Degrowth Will Save the World," the movement calls for [reducing
consumption and production]{.underline} of things that harm the planet
such fossil fuels, SUVs, private jets, mansions, fast fashion,
industrial beef, cruise ships, and the military--industrial complex.

While the term may be unfamiliar to many Americans, its [core ideas have
cropped up in the **[G]{.mark}**reen **[N]{.mark}**ew
**[D]{.mark}**eal's goals of a post-fossil fuel economy]{.underline};
the [**[pandemic]{.mark}**-era phenomenon of **[white-collar
workers]{.mark}** voluntarily quitting their jobs and working
less]{.underline}; and the [recent [social media trend]{.mark} of "no
buy,"]{.underline} which [encouraged]{.underline} [people]{.underline}
to **[[purchase less]{.underline}]{.mark}** and **[[repurpose]{.mark}
[more]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 

"[People]{.underline} are getting a [sense]{.underline} [that they're
ripped off]{.underline}, that they're being taken advantage of and
exploited as consumers," said Aaron Vansintjan, co-author of "The Future
Is Degrowth: A Guide to a World Beyond Capitalism." "It is
[promising]{.underline} [that people are responding to the
[current]{.mark} moment by showing their **[distrust]{.mark}** of these
**corporations**."]{.underline}

The [boycott]{.underline} has
[drawn [wide]{.mark}--ranging **[media coverage]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[along]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the [attention of
some celebrities]{.underline}. It also caught the attention of Linda
Sarsour, a progressive activist best known for organizing the 2017
Women's March after Trump's first election. 

"It is an easy risk-free way to [invite **[masses]{.mark}** of people to
[**act** in reaction]{.mark}]{.underline} to the outrageousness of this
Administration," Sarsour told The Intercept in an email. She said her
group, Until Freedom, is also backing the Black-led boycott of Target,
which rolled back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in
lockstep with the Trump administration's attacks on DEI in the federal
government. A separate pro-DEI boycott by Rev. Al Sharpton's National
Action Network is being planned after committing to "do the Dr.
King-Rosa Parks on" companies that have eliminated diversity efforts.

Degrowth misses an allocation mechanism 

"[Under]{.underline} a [capitalist]{.underline} system,
[prices]{.underline} [provide]{.underline} [incentives]{.underline} and
signals so that these continuous allocation problems are solved in a
decentralized way \[...\] [Under ecosocialism]{.underline},
[everything]{.underline} instead [becomes a centralized problem of
allocation]{.underline} and must be solved through common
decision-making, or a rulebook for all possible situation" (p. 68). This
is a false dilemma with only two options: free markets that are
efficient and democratic (capitalism) versus Soviet-style centralised
planning that is the precise opposite. [If degrowth criticises
capitalism, [Terzi]{.mark} suggests, then it must endorse the
other]{.underline}. 

This [critique]{.underline} [[**misses** the point]{.underline}]{.mark}.
First, **[[allocation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is a [**secondary issue**
for degrowth]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is first and foremost concerned
with issues of scale. Let's remember Herman Daly's three goals: an
[[economy]{.underline}]{.mark} should have a **[[sustainable]{.mark}
scale]{.underline}**, a [just distribution]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} an [efficient allocation]{.underline} (see Chapter 5
in Herman Daly's Economics for a Full World). Even [if]{.underline} one
were to argue that [free markets]{.underline} are the [best]{.underline}
allocative mechanism (I will have more to say about this soon), [it
still remains]{.underline} that [an economy who]{.underline}
[operates]{.underline} [over]{.underline} its [biophysical carrying
capacity]{.underline} is doom to collapse sooner or later.
[Debates]{.underline} [over]{.underline} [allocation should not
distract]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [the fact that advanced
[capitalist]{.mark} economies]{.underline} currently
[[suffer]{.underline} [from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** problem, namely
the [**unsustainability** of their ecological footprint]{.underline}. 

The scale debate has two positions. Either you can show that high-income
nations can keep increasing their levels of production and consumption
while falling back within planetary boundaries (that's the green growth
position), or you must accept that a certain downscaling of economic
activities will be necessary (that's the degrowth position). I have
spent considerable efforts since the publication of Decoupling
debunked (2019) researching that dilemma and the [scientific
literature]{.underline} seems to be [converging towards a
growth-critical consensus]{.underline}, as [exemplified]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} the results of the [latest IPCC report]{.underline}. As
someone whose job it is to find a way to make economies more
sustainable, [I would]{.underline} be the first to [celebrate evidence
of economic growth ceasing to be an ecological issue]{.underline}. But
that's [simply]{.underline} not [happening]{.underline}, as
[evidenced]{.underline} [by]{.underline} a [growing]{.underline} number
of [empirical studies]{.underline} showing something that is hardly
surprising: [producing]{.underline} [more]{.underline} [makes it harder
to pollute less]{.underline}. 

Back to allocation. If the jury is still out on the role of markets for
degrowth (for my take on it, see pp. 289-301 in The political economy of
degrowth), [I **[cannot]{.mark}** [think]{.mark} [of]{.mark} any
[growth-critical]{.mark} scholar defending their **total
[abolition]{.mark}**. What [degrowth]{.mark} **[opposes]{.mark}** is the
**[constant expansion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [commodity]{.mark}
domain]{.underline}. The [access]{.underline} [to]{.underline} certain
[goods and services]{.underline} (healthcare, education, housing, etc.)
[should be **organised** differently]{.underline} [than]{.underline}
[through commercial competition]{.underline}. This can take the form [of
external regulations]{.underline} like minimum and maximum wages,
the [banning of fossil fuels]{.underline} ads as recently introduced in
Amsterdam, or the pricing of carbon via a Tradable Energy Quotas. Or it
can also happen by [changing]{.underline} certain [rules]{.underline}
[within markets]{.underline}. For example, Jennifer Hinton defends a
vision of post-growth where allocation is organised via markets but only
with "[not-for-profit businesses]{.underline}" (markets without
profits); Sophie Swaton proposes an "Ecological Transition Income" given
via a system of [local for-employment cooperatives]{.underline} (markets
without unbalanced wage-labour relations); and a diversity
of alternative monies are already in place trying to make market
dynamics fairer and more sustainable (markets without general-purpose
money). Since there is **[[nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in]{.underline} [the degrowth literature
[indicat]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [[markets]{.underline}]{.mark} as
modes of allocation [[should]{.mark} completely **[cease]{.mark}** to
exist, criticising degrowth on that ground is deceitful. ]{.underline}

[What [Terzi]{.mark} [criticises]{.mark} here is **not** degrowth but
**[socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [But [even]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
critique **[falls flat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Depicting]{.underline}
[planning]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [bureaucratic]{.underline} and
uneconomic [is]{.underline} as much [a strawman]{.underline} as
depicting markets as decentralised and efficient. Both [allocating
mechanisms]{.underline}, with their respective strengths and weaknesses,
[can experience a whole spectrum of performance]{.underline}. The real
question is whether an allocative arrangement is appropriate. Most
countries forbid the buying and selling of organs and most countries
allow people to buy and sell socks. [Markets are not fitting
instruments]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [allocate]{.underline}
[organs]{.underline} and there is no pressing reason to carefully plan
the sock economy. [Reading Terzi, one]{.underline} [feels]{.underline}
that [economies should]{.underline} [choose between total marketisation
and total planning]{.underline}. But [this is **not** a **football
game**]{.underline}. In practice, [[economies]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[host]{.mark} a [**diversity** of allocation]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline} and I find [[**little value**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} these [**[heads-or-tails]{.mark}**
[debates]{.mark}]{.underline} [about]{.underline}
[ideal]{.underline}-typical economic [systems]{.underline} [that exist
nowhere but in economic textbooks. ]{.underline}

It is this world crisis that is driving the revolutionary uprisings that
erupted across the globe in 2024 -- a crisis that must be resolved
through the victory of the world socialist revolution in
2025.\]{.underline}
We send our warmest revolutionary greetings to the Palestinian people
who have faced an unprecedented genocidal war by the imperialist-backed
Zionist regime.\
Despite the massive number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli
campaign of indiscriminate bombings, and the deliberate use of
starvation as a weapon of war, the Zionists have completely failed to
crush the Hamas resistance, release captives or force Palestinians out
of Gaza.\
This campaign of genocide has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, the
majority being women and children, and was only possible because of the
full support of the United States and its faithful allies in
Britain.[\]{.underline}
Israel's role as imperialist attack dog in the Middle East has failed to
defeat Hamas and it has failed to destroy the Lebanese resistance
movement Hezbollah.\
News Line sends revolutionary greetings to the Lebanese resistance force
and masses who fought Israel's attempt to smash their support for
Palestine by bombing and a military invasion.\
At the end of November, the Israeli 'security cabinet' of prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu was forced to accept a ceasefire agreement with
Hezbollah.\
This ceasefire was pushed on them by the US and France desperate to put
an end to a disastrous war that they knew would escalate beyond control
throughout the Middle East.\
As Hamas stated at the time: 'The enemy's acceptance of the agreement
with Lebanon without fulfilling the conditions it set out is an
important milestone in shattering Netanyahu's illusions of changing the
map of the Middle East by force.'\
It was also a shattering blow to Israel's imperialist masters, whose
scheme to obliterate Palestinians, crush all resistance to imperialist
domination and secure the oil rich region for capitalist domination has
met the unbroken resistance of the masses.\
The entire situation has spiralled out of control of the Zionist regime
and its backers, who have long portrayed Israel as the only 'democratic
country' in the region and conferred on it the absolute right to ignore
rulings by the International Criminal Court, which in November finally
issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu for war crimes and crimes
against humanity.\
What is impossible to ignore is the massive support for Palestine by
workers and youth across the world.\
In the UK, hundreds of thousands have marched every week calling for the
defeat of their own government and in support of a general strike to end
all complicity and arms deals with the genocidal Israeli regime.\
[There are [mass demonstrations]{.mark} throughout [Europe]{.mark},
while [in]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}, students are carrying on with campus
occupations in support of Palestine despite all the threats and
intimidation against them by college authorities and the
police.\]{.underline}
This [[uprising by tens of millions]{.mark} of [workers and young
people]{.mark} has created a [massive **crisis** for]{.mark} the [world
capitalist class]{.mark}.\]{.underline}
The ruling class are already reeling from the abject failure of
imperialist war in the Ukraine designed to weaken [Russia]{.mark} and
leave it [open to regime change]{.mark} and capitalist restoration.\
[The attempts by [world imperialism]{.mark}, led by the US, to impose
regime change and [dictatorship]{.mark} on the world is [driving
revolution]{.mark} across the globe as workers and youth rise up against
war and the barbarism of a capitalist system that is gripped by
[economic and political crisis]{.mark}.\]{.underline}
This is a crisis that the ruling class can only hope to survive by
dumping it on the backs of the people of the world and the working class
at home.\
This war on two fronts has created absolute turmoil and catastrophe in
the old bourgeois political order.\
In Europe, the two main capitalist nations, France and Germany, both
enter 2025 without functioning governments as the old bourgeois
political order has collapsed.\
In both countries, the immediate cause of these collapses was the
resistance of the working class to savage cuts to government spending
that the bankers demanded in order to cut the massive national debts of
both countries.\
[It is the [debt crisis]{.mark} that is [strangling cap]{.mark}italism
[across the globe]{.mark}, and driving revolutionary confrontations as
the ruling class attempt to bring down debt by destroying the wages and
benefits of workers.]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--Democratic Socialism\-\--1NC

University of Lausanne, PhD in Economics from the University of Leeds;
Monthly Review, "Democratic Planning for Degrowth,"
https://monthlyreview.org/2023/07/01/democratic-planning-for-degrowth/\]

We live in truly historic times. According to the recent UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report, [there is a
"**rapidly closing** window of opportunity" to secure a livable and
**sustainable future** for all]{.underline}. [To
**prevent**]{.underline} a catastrophic "hothouse Earth" scenario of
**[extreme warming]{.underline}** and sea-level rise, "rapid and
[far-reaching **[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}s across all sectors
and systems [are **[necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}." There is
[**mounting** evidence that]{.underline}, for rich countries, [to
achieve the **necessary**]{.underline} much faster mitigation pathways
[requires **abandoning** aggregate economic **growth**]{.underline}.

Despite all efforts at decarbonization in high-income countries, which
are often trumpeted as showing that GDP can be decoupled from emissions,
the [**scale** and **speed** of emission reductions is **nowhere** near
what would be **necessary**]{.underline}. Indeed, scientific evidence
from recent years shows that if the countries of the Global North
continue to pursue "[**[green growth]{.mark}**," it is extremely
**[unlikely]{.mark}** that **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as emissions will be
**reduced**]{.underline} at the rate and scale [needed [to
**avoid**]{.mark} climate [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let us take
Europe as an example: While the shift to lower-carbon energy between
1990 and 2020 has enabled a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 34
percent (not accounting for trade), these reductions of less than 1
percent per year on average are far from what is needed to curb climate
breakdown, which are estimated to be around 11 percent reductions per
year for Germany, or 6 percent for the European Union, according to the
German Advisory Council on the Environment. Other analysis points to the
need for even steeper emission reductions.1

In fact, an increasingly [robust body of **scientific** literature shows
that **green** growth cannot be **sustainable**]{.underline}---but also,
that a [**different** form of organizing society is
**possible**]{.underline}.2 To achieve sustainability, so-called
developed [countries [need to **abandon**]{.mark} the objective of GDP
[growth and **scale down**]{.mark} less necessary and destructive forms
of **[production]{.mark}** to reduce energy and material
use]{.underline}. [We [need a **planned**]{.mark} and selective
[**contraction** of economic activity]{.mark}]{.underline} aimed at
increasing well-being and equality.3 Or, as recently argued in this
journal, [we need "**[ecosocialist degrowth]{.mark}**]{.underline}."4
Degrowth is [**[founded on]{.mark}** and justified by [a **solid
critique** of **market instruments**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
optimistic [[reliance on **price**]{.mark} **mechanisms** [and
**private-sector**]{.mark} solutions]{.underline}, which are
[**central** to so-called "green economy" approaches]{.underline}.
Indeed, the lack of social-ecological planning and the reliance on
socially unjust and often [[**ineffective** market]{.mark} instruments
is precisely what has [**led** us into]{.mark} this
**[mess]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the first place.

[**[Degrowth]{.mark}** formulates [an **alternative** to]{.mark} the
[capitalist **market**]{.mark}]{.underline} that seeks to [**escape**
the capitalist **growth imperative**]{.underline}, which continuously
impedes mitigation efforts by driving rising energy demand.5
[**Degrowth** is built around a fundamental [**democratization**
of]{.mark} the [economy and]{.mark} collective
"**[self-limitation]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (per André Gorz), or the
setting of collectively defined societal boundaries and entitlements
that define the conditions for a good life for all.6 All of [this is
going to **require** democratic planning]{.underline}. In fact,
collective self-limitation can be understood as the strongest expression
of democratic, societal autonomy, manifested in social liberation from
the pervasive "heteronomous" logic of accumulation. It is [the [drive to
**accumulation**]{.mark} that compels **capitalist** societies to pursue
continuous **expansion** and that [**prevents** adherence to]{.mark}
democratically determined [**collective** rules]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}** is an expression of societal freedom
or autonomy, in the sense of an act of collective self-government, thus
**[[resisting]{.underline}]{.mark}** "the functional regulation of
conduct according to given principles, such as [the so-called [law of
the **market**]{.mark} or the [**mantra** of]{.mark} austerity and
**[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}."7

So, how might planning beyond growth look? [**[Degrowth]{.mark}** does
not have to **reinvent** the wheel]{.underline}. [It can [build on
**ongoing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, productive debates about [ecological
**[planning]{.mark}**, participatory economies, and **economic**
democracy]{.underline}. These topics have been extensively studied in
the fields of geography, environmental management, and industrial
engineering, and have been a key focus in economic and socialist
literature. [Currently, [there is a **resurgence**]{.mark} of interest
[in]{.mark} economic **[planning]{.mark}** as a [**postcapitalist**
project]{.mark}]{.underline}.8 Most of these planning discussions, as
well as related debates on digitalization platform communism, have
largely neglected ecological questions, the issue of growth or degrowth,
and limits in general.9 Fortunately, there are some notable exceptions
in the ecosocialist tradition, as well as recent efforts to revive
democratic socialist planning in response to present ecological
crises.10

[**Ecological** planning for **degrowth**]{.underline} can be thought of
as [the **democratic** deliberation of both **ecological** limits and
**social** needs]{.underline}, or of planning what in heterodox economic
thought has become known as "'the donut.'" This means that
[society]{.underline}---[based on **scientific** evidence]{.underline}
and public debate---[**democratically** decides how to **organize** the
process of social **provisioning** and how to avoid **transgressing**
planetary boundaries]{.underline}. After all, while both planetary
boundaries and social needs are often understood as objective scientific
concepts, [they can **only** become politically **effective** if they
result from **societal** decision-making processes]{.underline}.11

Ecological planning beyond growth can take various forms. Ultimately, it
could [[**converge** around]{.mark} multilevel]{.underline}, fractally
integrated, [**[non-market]{.mark}**-mediated]{.underline} and
subsidiary planning **[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
coordinate the local with society-wide and global institutions, as we
have argued in a recent paper.12 But **[degrowth]{.underline}** is not
only [a proposal for a full-fledged **postcapitalist**
economy]{.underline}, but centrally a proposal for transformation, not
only conceptualizing the goal, but also the path from where we are
today. Degrowth thus discusses how to [**transform** existing
institutions through **radical** reforms]{.underline} that create growth
independencies and improve sustainability and justice. Its radical
policy proposals can be interpreted as [using **planning** tools for a
social-ecological **transformation**]{.underline} of industrial
societies that start within markets, through the state, and on local or
national levels, but that [continuously **push back** against
competitive **market** forces]{.underline} and hierarchical states, and
will eventually have to transform global institutions.

Degrowth policies, we argue, offer a variety of key entry points for
ecological planning beyond growth, as they conceptualize radical change
starting from existing institutions. This approach is similar to what
Gorz has called "non-reformist reforms," or Rosa Luxemburg's
"revolutionary Realpolitik." We highlight five sets of such radical
degrowth policy areas that could form an integral part of ecosocial
planning, transitioning to a postgrowth economy beyond capitalism.

\(1\) Selective flourishing and [**[downscaling]{.mark}** of
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}: The changes necessary to achieve a
just, low-carbon transition are far-reaching and complex. The most
obvious case in point, from a degrowth perspective, is the question of
expansion and contraction. A degrowth transformation means that
"creative destruction" (per Joseph Schumpeter) and related
expansion---or, to put it differently, the [**[phasing out]{.mark}** and
simultaneous **expansion** of different **[sectors]{.mark}**,
technologies, **[resource-uses]{.mark}**, or **economic**
activities]{.underline}---would [**[no longer]{.mark}** be [left
to]{.mark} the **[market]{.mark}**, **competition**, and
**prices**]{.underline}. Most importantly, rapid mitigation demands
active reduction and phasing out of fossil fuel production and use based
on a binding and scientifically determined schedule that takes remaining
carbon budgets into account.

Yet [it is **not** just **fossil fuels**]{.underline} that must be dealt
with---fast mitigation in rich countries also [requires **phasing out**
other globalized, **profit**-oriented, **unsustainable** industrial
economic **sectors**]{.underline} that do not serve the common good,
while at the same time improving and expanding activities that ensure
human flourishing within ecological limits, such as all aspects of care,
renewable energy sources, regenerative agriculture, low-carbon public
transport, and so on. Economic coordination and [planning are
**central** to achieve this]{.underline}. Social activity that does not
advance human well-being, such as "bullshit" and "batshit" jobs, the
arms industry and the military, advertising, lobbying, planned
obsolescence, fast fashion, border security, and large parts of the
financial industry, will have to be scaled down. The same goes for any
economic activity that cannot be restructured socioecologically, such as
a large part of motorized individual transport (above all in cities),
air transport, and globalized trade, as well as industrial agriculture
and industrial animal farming. To ensure the affected workers (and
communities) are at the center of this process, just transitions should
involve processes of conversion of firms and industries, adequate
retraining of workers, and early retirement schemes. Besides
sector-specific arrangements, [**degrowth** strives for a more **just
distribution** of work]{.underline} at the societal level, including
both commodified and uncommodified work. This will have to involve
decided processes that consider the multiple existing inequities along
the lines of gender, race and class, among others.13

revolutionaries **throughout the world**]{.mark}]{.underline} build off
the political theory Marx first formulated. [If this were untrue, there
would be no **Russian**]{.underline} Revolution, no

applied it [to]{.mark} its [**specific and unique circumstances** by
building off]{.mark} the [**long struggles** against exploitation and
European imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Even for Indigenous peoples in the Americas]{.underline}, the [concepts
and theories of [decol]{.mark}onization **explicitly [derive]{.mark}**
[from **Marxist revolutionary movements**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It's
**dishonest**]{.underline} for us [to not recognize this
history]{.underline}. It's not because of Marx or European thinkers that
these revolutions were successful. It's because Marxism is the science
of revolution for the poor masses, the colonized, and the wretched of
the earth. Fundamentally, [[Marxism is the science of **how to get
free**]{.mark}. It is the study of class struggle]{.underline}.

[If capitalism upholds the systems of racism, settler colonialism,
heteropatriarchy, and imperialism, then we **cannot** use capitalism to
undo these systems]{.underline}. [[It's **not enough** to]{.mark} just
[be anti-capitalist]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like our ancestors [[we
must]{.mark} be **forward-thinking** by drawing from and amplifying our
non-capitalist social relations as Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, not
to make Indigenous traditions relevant to Marxism or socialism but [to
[make]{.mark} socialism and [Marxism **relevant** to]{.mark} our
[struggle as **Indigenous peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[You **cannot fight fire with fire**]{.mark}. You cannot fight
[capitalism with Indigenous capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. You cannot
fight nationalism with hyper-nationalism. [You can only fight fire with
**water**. And the solution to all these ills]{.underline}---and it is
what capitalists and colonists hate the most---[is **socialism**. [If
capitalism is burning the planet]{.mark}, then [socialism is the water
to **douse the flame**]{.mark}. Water is life. We all need water to
live, but we **don't need capitalism**]{.underline}.

[And for us to fight colonialism, we must ensure that our nations can
live. But our nationalism cannot mirror the **bourgeois settler
nationalism** of colonial states, which is premised on exclusion and
white supremacy. We adopt a **revolutionary Indigenous nationalism**
that aligns with the most **oppressed and marginalized**
first]{.underline}, within and outside our own communities. And we
recognize that by organizing production---for our food, medicines,
resources, etc.---according to need and not profit is the only possible
path forward according to our traditions.

[The [philosophy of communism]{.mark} neatly [lines up with]{.mark} the
philosophy of our **[Indigenous ancestors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Friedrich Engels admitted as much when in the 1888 English edition of
the Communist Manifesto he added a footnote to the famous line: "The
history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class
struggle." He clarified, "That is, all written history," making note
specifically of Lewis Henry Morgan's study of the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, which was a communistic, classless, and democratic society
before European invasion. Moreover, it was the relative gender equality
of Indigenous societies that inspired the suffragettes--white women
seeking parity with white men. [The study of Indigenous societies, the
[**inherent equality and freedom** they engendered]{.mark} among
producers and the common ownership of property and social institutions,
also **[inspired European workers]{.mark}** to demand eight-hour
workdays [and]{.mark} the abolition of child labor]{.underline}. And, in
the final analysis, despite their own limited understandings, [[Marx and
Engels]{.underline}]{.mark}, the founders of the modern communist
movement, had [developed theories of emancipation largely from the
**expropriated knowledges** of Indigenous and communal
people]{.underline}, whose examples they relied on to prove that
capitalism is neither inevitable nor natural. But, in fact, [[communism
is]{.mark} both **[natural and inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This is **not** to suggest Indigenous societies were
**utopias**]{.underline}--no society is perfect. [It is, however,
important to understand that Indigenous peoples have been **knocked off
the path** of their natural social development to live in balance and
correct relations. We are not trying to recreate the past so much as
[steer Indigenous nations **back** on]{.mark} their **[communal
developmental]{.mark} path**]{.underline} that has been destroyed or
seriously distorted by capitalist social relations.

### Alt\-\--Psychoanalysis\-\--1NC

#### Anti-capitalism is defined by a [foundational negativity]{.underline} that continuously reshapes itself in response to capitalism's exclusions --- that's key to [ethically responsive]{.underline} collective action grounded in [emotional identification]{.underline} with the lack.

and Health Sciences, University of South Africa and South African

// K Nahm

As an organisational form, [anti-capitalism is determined by a
**foundational negativity**]{.underline}. This is to say that [the
symbolic field of anti-capitalist organisation attends to what is
excluded by capitalism]{.underline}. We can, therefore, contrast the
anti-capitalist form with those organisational forms premised on
positively defined inclusion criteria. For example, in responding to
lingering Cold War sentiments that associate socialism with
authoritarianism, several contemporary anti-capitalist efforts in the US
are organising under the signifier 'democratic socialism' (e.g. the
Democratic Socialists of America). Effective as this has been (the
resurgence of socialism in the US in recent years cannot be denied), the
positive constitution of the signifier 'democratic socialism' forecloses
the organisational forms available to this signifier which, in turn, has
political implications. As several commentators have noted, although the
2016 Bernie Sanders campaign was able to successfully profess its
democratic character by identifying itself with the democratic socialism
signifier, it struggled to reflect a 'deeper analysis of the racialized
nature of U.S. capitalism' (Ransby, 2015: 34). Even when the Sanders
campaign did embrace an explicitly anti-racist political programme,
signifying its allegiance to this programme remained challenging. This
was evidenced in the many anti-racist activists who felt dissatisfied
with the campaign (see Reed, 2020). Yet, even if the campaign took up a
positively constituted signifier that successfully reflected its
anti-racist commitments (e.g. anti-racist democratic socialism), this
signifier could not attend to all capitalist exclusions that the
campaign sought to address (e.g. gender oppression; see Albrecht, 2017).
Such [positively defined organisational forms]{.underline} thus [present
a problem of indefinite inclusiveness]{.underline}, that is, [a
fetishisation of presence whereby]{.underline} repeated [attempts to
reflect]{.underline} all [struggles within an organisational
form]{.underline}'s signifying field [leads to an]{.underline}
always-[insufficient inclusivity]{.underline} (Nunes, 2021). The
positive signifier will always fail because it cannot include
everything. The base negativity of anti-capitalist organisation, on the
other hand, represents an expressed inability to signify the whole; a
self-conscious failure to include all positively defined struggles.
Every struggle against capitalism is thus always already part of
anti-capitalism's signifying field, meaning that the anti-capitalist
form is determined by the democratic will of all who are excluded by
capitalism. Put differently, [[anti-capitalism as a **form of forms**
does not seek to stabilise itself]{.underline}]{.mark} by accommodating
various inclusion criteria. Instead, [[the anti-capitalist form is
perpetually re-made by the **exclusions** of
capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [refusal]{.mark} of anti-capitalism [to retreat]{.mark}
in[to]{.mark}]{.underline} unchanging or [**[fixed]{.mark}
organisational [forms]{.mark}** [means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[it is
driven]{.underline},]{.mark} rather than debilitated, [[by the
**internal tensions** of the **collective**]{.underline}]{.mark}. When
comrades articulate their political tactics, goals, and strategies
together and in accordance with different emancipatory struggles,
[organisational [forms are made through]{.mark}]{.underline} the most
pressing political commitments of **[[the moment]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} self-contained and [unchanging
[political programmes]{.mark}]{.underline} with which comrades are
expected to identify, no matter what. Adapting to or moving with the
most urgent emancipatory requirements in this way is essential for
holding the collective accountable to its own political commitments. For
instance, in 2013, when a senior party member of the Socialist Workers'
Party (SWP) in the UK was accused of sexual assault, the case was heard
but ultimately dismissed by the party, leaving many party members
feeling betrayed (Penny, 2013). By foreclosing its organisational form,
the SWP could not adequately attend to its internal struggles (struggles
which mirrored those of the very capitalist order the party opposes)
and, as a result, the party form came to reflect the patriarchal
interests of its male leaders. The SWP's strict adherence to entrenched
organisational practices meant that it could not reckon with the
symbolic limits of these practices. It is in this respect that
anti-capitalism's ability to detotalise finality reflects a kind of
ethics that is attentive to situations that cannot be effectively
addressed -- or predicted -- by fixed organisational formations.
Anti-capitalist organisation is constituted through intersubjective
tension, which is to say, the anti-capitalist form is premised on the
ebbs and flows of oppression under capitalism. This is especially
pertinent in cases where a particular organisational form is defined by
oppressive practices and must, in turn, be reformed and/or abandoned for
a different organisational form.

Although [[anti-capitalism]{.mark} takes seriously tactics]{.underline},
strategies, and goals (all of which are shaped by democratic will and
the emancipatory demands of the moment), [it is]{.underline} also [an
organisational form that [takes seriously the **mobilisation of
passions**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mouffe, 2005), that is, the affect
produced between comrades organising against capitalism. Indeed,
[[investing psychically in a political project]{.underline}]{.mark} is
generally not undertaken or sustained at the intellectual level. It
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} more typically [[an **emotional
identification**]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that has been thoroughly
[[repressed by Enlightenment rationality]{.underline}]{.mark} (Glynos,
2001). To understand [anti-capitalism]{.underline}'s ability to [marshal
people's psychic investments]{.underline}, we must once again turn to
Lacan's (2002) notion of enjoyment. As noted earlier, enjoyment -- or
what Lacan called jouissance -- is an unconscious satisfaction obtained
from symbolic rupture or incoherence. [[Under capitalism]{.mark},
[subjects]{.mark} usually [derive enjoyment from **excessive
accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (McGowan, 2016); an imagined
coherence of the ego (Hook, 2013); [and]{.underline}/or political
[fantasies [that animate **individualistic
desires**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mouffe, 2005).
[[Anti-capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[offers]{.mark}
another kind of enjoyment]{.underline}, one that is [premised
on]{.underline} a foundational negativity, or what Lacanians prefer to
call **[[lack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We can enjoy lack because [[it
returns us to an imagined moment when we sacrificed our apparent psychic
wholeness for a **symbolic order**]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e. the basis
of our communication) [that is **[riven by
contradiction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (McGowan, 2013).
[[Anti-capitalism's refusal of definitive organisation]{.mark}al forms
[means]{.mark} that [subjects can enjoy]{.mark} the identifications,
strategies, and [tactics **that are not provided**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(and are instead constantly being built, modified, abandoned, and
transformed in accordance with democratic struggle). Even when
[[anti-capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} does assume a particular
formation, it **[[is a formation that lacks because it is subject
to]{.mark} [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Anti-capitalism's inherent
lack introduces desire into political activity]{.underline} (i.e. our
organising activity is driven by the organisational form's
lack-in-being, rather than the attainment of a specific form)
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, in this regard, anti-capitalist organisation
[is imbued with a psychic appeal that is more often mobilised by the
excesses of the political right]{.underline} (McGowan, 2016). Therefore,
[to enjoy lack]{.underline} in this way [[counters our **libidinal
investment in capitalist excess**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Glynos, 2001),
while also relieving us of the ideological pressures to enjoy such
excess (Žižek, 2006).

[Advocates]{.underline} of the free market [**tirelessly** use the
**failure** of **Soviet** planning to **justify** their]{.underline}
categorical **[opposition]{.underline}** to any form of organized
economy. We know, without getting into a discussion on the successes and
failures of the Soviet experience, [that it was obviously a form
of]{.underline} "[**dictatorship** over needs]{.underline}," to quote
the expression used by György Markus and his colleagues from the
Budapest School: an undemocratic and authoritarian system which gave a
monopoly over decisions to a small oligarchy of techno-bureaucrats. [It
was **not planning** that led to the dictatorship]{.underline}. [It was
the growing **limitation** of **democracy**]{.underline} within the
Soviet state and the establishment of totalitarian bureaucratic power
[after **Lenin's death**]{.underline} that gave rise to an increasingly
authoritarian and undemocratic planning system. [If socialism is to be
defined as **control** of production **processes** by
workers]{.underline} and the general population, [the **Soviet Union**
under Stalin]{.underline} and his successors [**fell** far
**short**]{.underline} of this definition.

The failure of the USSR illustrates the limits and contradictions of
bureaucratic planning with its flagrant ineffectiveness and
arbitrariness: [it **cannot serve** as an argument against the
application of **genuinely** democratic planning]{.underline}. [The
**socialist conception** of planning **is**]{.underline} nothing other
than [the **radical democratization** of the economy]{.underline}: if
[**political decisions** should **not** be **made** by a small
elite]{.underline} of leaders, [why not **apply** the
**same**]{.underline} principle [to **economic decisions**]{.underline}?
The question of the balance between market and planning mechanisms is
undoubtedly a complex issue: during the first phases of the new society,
markets will certainly still occupy a significant place, but as the

A question arises: [what **guarantee** do we have that **people** will

Admittedly, for planning to work, [there must be **executive** and

but their [authority would be **limited** by the]{.underline} permanent

Capitalism can be abolished only by taking political power and rewriting
the rules that govern economic activity.

One possible objection to the aim of the socialist movement to take
state power is the claim that capitalism has evolved into a global
system that cannot be replaced within individual nation-states. That
argument is sometimes associated with the belief that the capitalist
classes of the various countries have merged to form a single global
capitalist class, whose rule can be ended only at the global level.3
This author finds such claims unconvincing.

From its beginning, [**capitalism** has tended to **expand**
geographically in search of **markets**]{.underline}, cheap labor, and
raw materials. [That has led to expansion of capitalist enterprises
**beyond** the national boundaries of the **home country**]{.underline}.
However, that tendency has not abolished the central role of the
nation-state in capitalism. [Capitalism **requires** a political
**institution** that can define and **enforce** its rules]{.underline},
and no global-level institution has emerged that can play that role
effectively. Despite the rise of the United Nations, the IMF, and the
World Trade Organization, nation-states, especially large and powerful
ones, continue to play the primary role. Hence [capitalism remains
**fundamentally** a system of nation-**state**-level class
**relations**]{.underline}. [The existence of]{.underline} many forms of
cross-state interchange, including **[trade]{.underline}** in goods and
services, capital flows, cross-state shareholdings, and profit flows,
[does **not make** capitalism into a fully **global**-level
system]{.underline}.4

In principle, [capitalism could become essentially a
global]{.underline}-level [system **if** a **world state**
emerged]{.underline} in the future that could carry out the necessary
roles of the state under capitalism. However, [such a development is
**not**]{.underline} even [on the **horizon**]{.underline} today, and
the obstacles to it are enormous. [The socialist **movement** should
**engage** in **communication**]{.underline} and cooperation [across
national boundaries]{.underline}, [but the **struggle** for
socialism]{.underline} remains one that [must be carried out
within]{.underline} individual nation-**[states]{.underline}**.

[**Socialists** should **confront**]{.underline} the threat of
[**fascism** by building a **broad front** in opposition]{.underline} to
it. That project will require working with individuals and groups that
are not friendly toward socialism and even groups that do not support
progressive reform. [The basis of such a broad anti-fascist front is a
**commitment** to **democracy**]{.underline}. Even a section of [big
business can be enlisted]{.underline} in such a broad front
[since]{.underline} a strong case can be made that [a **parliamentary
republic** is]{.underline}, as Lenin long ago pointed out, "[the best
political **shell** for **capitalism**]{.underline}."24 Capitalists can
support preservation of democratic forms that they view as supportive of
capitalism. [Socialists support even the **limited democracy** possible
under capitalism based on the **conviction** that it is **helpful** in
the struggle]{.underline} to defend working people's rights while a
fascist regime would harshly repress the working class and other popular
constituencies.

History has shown that [when **socialists** participate in a broad front
against fascism]{.underline}, not only can [they make a major
contribution to **defeating** it]{.underline}, [but at the same
time]{.underline} they can [**strengthen** the socialist
**movement**]{.underline}. [The communist parties in **Nazi-occupied**
European **states**]{.underline} greatly increased their popular support
through their leading role in the anti-fascist resistance. In [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [in the]{.underline}
mid- and late **[1930s]{.underline}**, the devastating effects of the
Great Depression spurred a growing fascist movement. The New Deal turned
left in the mid-1930s, under pressure from militant and usually left-led
worker trade union and community protests. [The **Communist Party**
followed a popular front policy that included quietly **supporting** the
**Roosevelt** Administration]{.underline} while pushing it to respond to
the needs of working people. [The **fascists** were
**marginalized**]{.underline} as millions of working people across the
United States, including in the South, turned to the left rather than
the right.25 By contrast, [the **inability** of the moderate Socialist
Party and the Communist Party]{.underline} in Weimar Germany [to
**work** together **facilitated** the rise]{.underline} to state power
[of the Nazis]{.underline}.

Democratic Planning

Who should make these decisions? Socialists often responded: "the
workers." In Volume III of Capital, Marx defines socialism as a society
of "the associated producers rationally regulating their interchange
(Stoffwechsel) with Nature." However, in Volume I of Capital, we find a
broader approach: [**socialism** is conceived as]{.underline} "[an
**association** of free]{.underline} ~~men~~
\[**[people]{.underline}**\], [working with the **means of
production**]{.underline} (gemeinschaftlichen) held in common." This is
a much more appropriate concept: production and consumption must be
organized rationally not only by the "producers" but also by consumers
and, in fact, the whole of society, the productive or "unproductive"
population: students, youth, women (and men) homemakers, retired
persons, etc.

In this sense, [society as a whole will be **free** to democratically
**choose** the productive lines]{.underline} to be promoted [and the
level of **resources** that should be **invested**]{.underline} in
education, health or culture. [The **prices** of goods]{.underline}
themselves would no longer respond to the law of supply and demand, but
[would be **determined**]{.underline} as much as possible [according to
**social**]{.underline}, political [and ecological
**criteria**]{.underline}.

Far from being "despotic" in itself, [democratic **planning**
is]{.underline} the exercise of the free decision-making of the whole of
society -- [a **necessary** exercise to **free** ourselves
from]{.underline} the alienating and reified "[economic
**laws**]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} "[iron **cages**]{.underline}"
[within capitalist]{.underline} and bureaucratic
[structures]{.underline}. [Democratic planning]{.underline} associated
with a reduction of working time [would be a considerable
**step**]{.underline} forward by humanity [toward]{.underline} what Marx
called "[the **realm** of **freedom**]{.underline}": the increase in
free time is in fact a condition for the participation of workers in
democratic discussion and management of the economy and society.

In the capitalist system use value is only a means -- and often a device
-- subordinated to exchange value and profitability (this in fact
explains why there are so many products in our society without any
utility). [In a planned socialist economy]{.underline}, [the
**production** of goods and services **responds** only to the criterion
of **use value**]{.underline}, [which entails
**spectacular**]{.underline} economic, social and ecological
**[consequences]{.underline}**.

Of course, democratic planning concerns the major economic choices and
not the administration of local restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries,
small shops, craft businesses or services. Likewise, it is important to
emphasize that [planning does not **contradict** the self-management of
**workers** in their **production** units]{.underline}. Whereas the
decision to convert, for example, an automobile factory to bus or rail
vehicle production would be up to society as a whole; the internal
organization and operation of the factory would be managed
democratically by the workers themselves. There has been much debate
over the "centralized" or "decentralized" nature of planning, but the
important thing remains [**democratic control** of the plan at **all
levels**]{.underline} -- local, regional, national, continental and,
hopefully, global -- [since **ecological issues** such as climate
warming are **global**]{.underline} and can only be addressed at that
level. This proposal could be called "[comprehensive **democratic
planning**]{.underline}." Even at this level, it is planning which
[**contrasts** with]{.underline} what is often described as "**[central
planning]{.underline}**" [because]{.underline} economic and social
[**decisions** are not taken by any]{.underline} "[center]{.underline}"
[but]{.underline} democratically determined [**by** the
**populations**]{.underline} concerned.

There would, of course, be tensions and contradictions between
self-governing institutions and local democratic administrations and
other larger social groups. [**Negotiating mechanisms** can help
**resolve** many such conflicts]{.underline}, but in the final analysis,
it will be up to the larger groups involved, and only if they are in the
majority, to exercise their right to impose their opinions. To give an
example: a self-managed factory decides to dump its toxic waste in a
river. The population of an entire region is threatened by this
pollution. It may then, following a democratic debate, decide that the
production of this unit must be stopped until a satisfactory solution to
control its waste is found. Ideally, [in an **ecosocialist**
society]{.underline}, [the factory **workers** themselves will have
**sufficient** ecological **awareness** to avoid making decisions that
are dangerous for the environment]{.underline} and the health of the
local population. However, the fact of introducing methods to guarantee
the decision-making power of the population to defend the most general
interests, as in the previous example, does not mean that questions
concerning internal management should not be submitted to the citizens
at the level of the factory, school, neighborhood, hospital or village.

Ecosocialist [**planning** must be based on a **democratic** and
pluralist **debate**]{.underline}, at each level of decision. Organized
in the form of parties, platforms or any other political movement, [the
**delegates** of the planning bodies are **elected** and the various
**proposals** are **presented** to everyone]{.underline} they concern.
In other words, representative democracy must be enriched -- and
improved -- by **[direct democracy]{.underline}** which [allows people
to choose directly]{.underline} -- locally, nationally and, ultimately,
internationally -- between different proposals. The whole population
would then make decisions on free public transit, on a special tax paid
by car owners to subsidize public transport, on the subsidization of
solar energy to make it competitive with fossil energy, on the reduction
of the hours of work to 30, 25 hours a week or less, even if this
entails a reduction in production.

The democratic nature of planning does not make it incompatible with the
participation of experts whose role is not to decide, but to present
their arguments -- often different, even opposed -- during the
democratic decision-making process. As Ernest Mandel said:

"Governments, parties, planning boards, **[scientists]{.underline}**,
technocrats or whoever [can **make suggestions**]{.underline}, put
forward proposals, try to influence people. To prevent them from doing
so would be to restrict political freedom. [But under a multi-party
system]{.underline}, such [proposals will never be
unanimous]{.underline}: [**people** will have the **choice**
between]{.underline} coherent [alternatives]{.underline}. And [the
**right**]{.underline} and power [to decide should be in the **hands**
of the **majority**]{.underline} of producers / consumers / citizens,
not of anybody else. What is paternalist or despotic about that?"2

[Advocates]{.underline} of the free market [**tirelessly** use the
**failure** of **Soviet** planning to **justify** their]{.underline}
categorical **[opposition]{.underline}** to any form of organized
economy. We know, without getting into a discussion on the successes and
failures of the Soviet experience, [that it was obviously a form
of]{.underline} "[**dictatorship** over needs]{.underline}," to quote
the expression used by György Markus and his colleagues from the
Budapest School: an undemocratic and authoritarian system which gave a
monopoly over decisions to a small oligarchy of techno-bureaucrats. [It
was **not planning** that led to the dictatorship]{.underline}. [It was
the growing **limitation** of **democracy**]{.underline} within the
Soviet state and the establishment of totalitarian bureaucratic power
[after **Lenin's death**]{.underline} that gave rise to an increasingly
authoritarian and undemocratic planning system. [If socialism is to be
defined as **control** of production **processes** by
workers]{.underline} and the general population, [the **Soviet Union**
under Stalin]{.underline} and his successors [**fell** far
**short**]{.underline} of this definition.

The failure of the USSR illustrates the limits and contradictions of
bureaucratic planning with its flagrant ineffectiveness and
arbitrariness: [it **cannot serve** as an argument against the
application of **genuinely** democratic planning]{.underline}. [The
**socialist conception** of planning **is**]{.underline} nothing other
than [the **radical democratization** of the economy]{.underline}: if
[**political decisions** should **not** be **made** by a small
elite]{.underline} of leaders, [why not **apply** the
**same**]{.underline} principle [to **economic decisions**]{.underline}?
The question of the balance between market and planning mechanisms is
undoubtedly a complex issue: during the first phases of the new society,
markets will certainly still occupy a significant place, but as the
transition to socialism progresses, [planning will become **increasingly
important**]{.underline}.

A question arises: [what **guarantee** do we have that **people** will
make the **right choices**]{.underline}, those that protect the
environment, even if the price to pay is to change part of their
consumption habits? [There is **no such**]{.underline}
"[guarantee]{.underline}," [only the **reasonable prospect** that the
**rationality** of democratic decisions will **triumph** once the
**fetishism** of consumer goods has been **abolished**]{.underline}.
People will of course make mistakes by making bad choices, but don't
[the **experts make mistakes** themselves]{.underline}? It is impossible
to imagine the construction of a new society without [the majority of
the **people** having reached a **great** socialist and ecological
**awareness** thanks to their **struggles**]{.underline}, their
self-education and their social experience. So, it is reasonable to
believe that [serious **errors**]{.underline} -- including decisions
inconsistent with environmental needs -- [will be
**corrected**]{.underline}. In any case, one wonders if [the
**alternatives**]{.underline} -- [the]{.underline} ruthless
[market]{.underline}, [an ecological dictatorship]{.underline} of
"experts" -- [are]{.underline} not [**much** more
**dangerous**]{.underline} than the democratic process, with all its
limits.

Admittedly, for planning to work, [there must be **executive** and
technical **bodies** capable of **implementing** decisions]{.underline},
but their [authority would be **limited** by the]{.underline} permanent
and democratic [control exercised by the **lower levels**]{.underline},
where workers' self-management takes place in the process of democratic
administration. It cannot be expected, of course, that the majority of
the population will spend all of their free time in self-management or
participatory meetings. As Ernest Mandel remarked: "Self-administration
does not entail the disappearance of delegation. It combines
decision-making by the citizens with stricter control of delegates by
their respective electorate."3

Any [**market socialist** alternative]{.underline} has to be

One must avoid substituting an Asian Eastphalian 'developmental peace'

The economic crisis of 2008‒9 and its aftermath

[By the **1990s**]{.underline}, popular [**discontent** with
the]{.underline} increasingly globalized [capitalist system was
**growing**]{.underline}. [The discontent culminated in a **militant
protest**]{.underline} in Seattle [in 1999 at a **W**]{.underline}orld
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[O]{.underline}**rganization
[conference]{.underline} that drew some 40,000 demonstrators. A broad
coalition of labor, student groups, NGOs, and media activists denounced
the free-trade agenda and human rights failures of global capitalism.

However, [it was the]{.underline} severe financial crisis and [**Great
Recession** of 2008‒9 that led **millions** of people to voice a
**suspicion** that the many **problems** afflicting the
majority]{.underline} were not isolated but connected to one another,
that they were not just unfortunate accidents or the result of bad
policies but rather [**stemmed** from the]{.underline} basic working of
the [**economic system** that dominates]{.underline} throughout [the
world]{.underline} today. [That suspicion found expression in the
massive **Occupy Wall Street**]{.underline} protest
[movement]{.underline} that broke out in New York City in September
2011. [It]{.underline} soon [spread to]{.underline} an estimated [**600
communities** across the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
an estimated **951 cities** across **82 countries**]{.underline} around
the world. The Occupy Movement directly targeted capitalism as the
problem, popularizing the class struggle slogan of the 99% against the
1%. Capitalism had become the target, and to many the solution required
a shift to its long-time challenger, socialism.

Why did the big crisis have that effect? From around 1980, the
[conventional wisdom held that]{.underline} a system of [free
markets]{.underline}, private enterprise, and very limited government
involvement in the economy [is the only viable way]{.underline} to
organize a modern economy. When anyone pointed out a problem arising
from that system, [the usual answer was]{.underline} "**[There is no
alternative]{.underline}**," a slogan used so often that it acquired its
own acronym of "TINA." This meant that [the **problem**]{.underline} --
whether [the rich getting richer while everyone else got
poorer]{.underline}, increasing economic insecurity, or the rising cost
of education -- [must be accepted as an **unavoidable**]{.underline}
cost of sticking with "the only possible" economic system.

[The crisis of **2008‒9**]{.underline} undermined the hold of the
previously dominant beliefs in two stages. First, it [**destroyed**
the]{.underline} key [claim that an **unregulated** capitalist economy
was]{.underline} inherently **[stable]{.underline}** and could not give
rise to a severe economic crisis. As [the]{.underline} financial [system
suddenly **tottered** on the edge of complete **collapse**]{.underline},
and as some [800,000 jobs disappeared each month]{.underline} in the
United States, the world was suddenly staring at the prospect of another
Great Depression

The response of the government to the crisis dealt a second blow to the
established beliefs. Suddenly, it turned out that [the promise that
everyone must **sink or swim** based on their **own efforts** turned out
**not** to **apply** to giant banks and **corporations**]{.underline},
which were bailed out by the government. However, [millions of
**homeowners** faced with foreclosure]{.underline} due to the crisis
[were]{.underline} largely [left to fend for
**themselves**]{.underline}. Wags noted that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has]{.underline}
"[socialism for the rich but capitalism for everyone else]{.underline}."
This was bound to make millions of people wonder whether something
called "socialism" might be a good idea.

Soon after the bailout of the banks and giant corporations, all of the
[major **governments** passed **large spending** programs and flooded
the economy with money]{.underline}, [actions that **previously** had
been viewed as **harmful**]{.underline} state interventions that could
not improve economic performance. While the global economy had been
collapsing faster in the first 11 months of the 2008‒9 crisis than in
the first 11 months of the Great Depression of the 1930s,26 [the massive
state **interventions**]{.underline} in 2008‒9 [soon stopped the
collapse]{.underline} of production [and **set** off a
**recovery**]{.underline}. A second Great Depression had been narrowly
averted.

[The crisis]{.underline} of 2008‒9, and the government response to it,
[provided a **dramatic demonstration** of the failure of unregulated
capitalism to live up to the claims of its advocates]{.underline}. [It
also demonstrated the potential **advantages** of an active
**government**]{.underline} role in the economy. Before 2008, it seemed
impossible to imagine any alternative to unregulated capitalism. Now
[unregulated capitalism had been **humiliated**]{.underline}. It should
not have come as a surprise that [**millions** of people]{.underline},
who had long been suffering from increasingly serious economic problems,
[began to **contemplate** an alterqnative]{.underline} to it.

Lessons of history

Some historical perspective is helpful for understanding the recent
sharp increase in criticism of the current system and attraction to
socialism. [About **every fifty years**]{.underline} or so, [the
capitalist **economy** has experienced a **severe** and persistent
economic **crisis**]{.underline}. Such crises are [rooted in the
particular institutional **structure**]{.underline} of capitalism in a
period, and so can be called structural crises. In the past, structural
[crises have not been resolved until a **major
restructuring**]{.underline} of capitalism [has taken
place]{.underline}, which can take a decade or more to emerge.
[Structural crises are **different** from]{.underline} the frequent
economic downturns known as **[recessions]{.underline}**. A recession
normally ends and economic expansion resumes within a year or two
without any major change in the form of capitalism.27

Such [structural crises]{.underline} of capitalism [took hold in the
**last 25 years** of the nineteenth century]{.underline}, [the
**1930s**]{.underline}, [and the **1970s**]{.underline}. Each past
structural crisis gave rise to demands from various groups and classes
for major change in the system, and each was resolved only after some
kind of restructuring of capitalism took place. Following each
restructuring of capitalism, a long period of more or less stable
economic expansion followed. [After **1900**]{.underline}, the [small
business capitalism]{.underline} of the nineteenth century [gave way to
a system of giant **corporations**]{.underline} and banks. From [the
mid-**1930s**]{.underline} to the late 1940s, a
**[state-regulated]{.underline}** form of [capitalism was
constructed]{.underline}. Around **[1980]{.underline}**, the
**[neoliberal]{.underline}** form of [capitalism emerged]{.underline}.
Each episode of restructuring included a shift in the dominant economic
ideas in society as well as changes in economic and political
institutions.28

Since 2008, [the **neoliberal** form]{.underline} of capitalism [has
been stuck in **another** structural **crisis**]{.underline}.29 In every
past structural crisis period, [previously **marginalized
proposals**]{.underline} for major change [**emerged** into the
mainstream]{.underline} of political debate. [In the
**1930s**]{.underline}, [support for **socialist**]{.underline} and
communist [parties **surged**]{.underline} in many countries, including
the United States. The American Communist Party played a role in
promoting the beginning of institutional changes that led to a reformed
capitalism that emerged fully after World War II. The crisis of the
1930s also enabled fascists to come to power in several major countries.
Fascism drew a significant following in the United States in the 1930s.
In the next structural crisis, [in the **1970s**]{.underline}, the
previously marginalized [**free-market** economic ideology rapidly came
to **dominate**]{.underline} the public discussion, and economic and
political institutions were restructured in accordance with its
recommendations. In the 1970s, alternative proposals for a more closely
regulated economy also were promoted by some academics and some business
leaders, but they were soundly defeated.30

While each past structural crisis of capitalism has had its own
distinctive features, [the]{.underline} structural [crisis since
**2008** has **significant similarities** to that of the
**1930s**]{.underline}. [The Great Depression **followed** a decade of
**free-market** capitalism]{.underline} in the 1920s, while [**today's**
crisis followed 25 years of a **similar**]{.underline} neoliberal
[form]{.underline} of capitalism. The 1930s crisis took the form of an
economic collapse followed by prolonged economic stagnation and high
unemployment. The crisis since 2008 began with an incipient economic
collapse that was arrested by large-scale government intervention, but
which was followed by a decade of economic stagnation indicated by very
slow economic growth. Figure 1.1 shows that the [**recovery** from the
Great Recession]{.underline} of 2008‒9 [was by far the
**slowest**]{.underline} of any economic recovery since 1949. The
unemployment rate, which hit double digits in the Great Recession, did
not fall below 5% until 2017, eight years after the Great Recession had
ended.31

The historical experience suggests that [it should **not** be
**surprising** that after 2008 previously marginalized
proposals]{.underline} for major change, both on the left and the right,
[have emerged]{.underline} into the public discussion. These have
included authoritarian nationalist appeals on the political right, and
on the left calls for progressive economic reform through strengthening
trade unions and expanding social welfare programs, as well as
endorsement of socialism. As long as the current crisis of neoliberal
capitalism continues, such [previously marginalized political positions
can be **expected** to **remain** on the table]{.underline}.

[What went wrong?]{.underline}

Apart from the consequences of the war and several unfavourable
objective conditions, the [main reasons were **subjective mistakes**
made by the **Communist** Party]{.underline}. Our first mistake was to
[**confuse** our starting point for the **destination**]{.underline}.
Building a **[socialist]{.underline}** society without exploitation and
a comprehensive system of social welfare is a noble objective --- but it
is [a **long process** of economic, cultural, and social
development.]{.underline} Vietnam had just entered the early phase of
the transitional period to socialism, but we [**rushed** to apply a
development model **incompatible** with our country's concrete
conditions]{.underline}.

For instance, most agricultural labour was still performed manually by
individual households --- these were no conditions under which to
collectivize labour, yet we rushed to push collectivization and even
develop high-level cooperatives. In Marxist terminology, we
over-socialized the relations of production beyond the existing level of
productive forces, which was still very low. This was in contradiction
with Marx's teachings, and negatively affected productivity.

The [application of centralized, bureaucratic planning]{.underline}
significantly [limited]{.underline} dynamism and
[creativity]{.underline} at the local level. Subsidizing housing, food,
health care, and education while the [state **budget**]{.underline} was
very tight could provide basic needs at best, but [**spared no
resources** for investing in development.]{.underline} Investment's
dependence on the state sector also limited resources for development.
The result was a fairly equal society, but in which everybody was
equally poor and had no possibility to improve their lives. [That is
**not what socialism should be** in practice.]{.underline}

Vietnam was a firm ally of the Soviet Union and the only Southeast Asian
member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon. How
integrated was Vietnam into the socialist economic system dominated by
the USSR?

It is important to understand the context of Vietnam's joining Comecon
in 1978. The war against French and American aggression had severe
consequences for Vietnam. In 1975, the [US imposed an **economic
embargo** and continuously **sabotaged** Vietnam's reconstruction
efforts]{.underline}. The Khmer Rouge, backed by China, launched a
genocide in Cambodia and aggressive attacks against Vietnam. Vietnam's
relations with China had been worsening since China turned to the US in
1972, and Vietnam's only real partners were the USSR and the socialist
countries in Eastern Europe. In this situation, Vietnam decided to join
Comecon in order to help the country overcome the legacy of the war and
develop its economy towards socialism.

As a member, [Vietnam was obliged to follow the rules and
recommendations of the bloc, but it is also important to note that
Vietnam was the **least integrated economy** in Comecon. Vietnam's
starting point was the lowest]{.underline}, far behind the level of
economic development in other Comecon member countries. Vietnam was not
only the poorest member of Comecon but also the most backwards economy
in the bloc, dominated by backwards agriculture and small-scale manual
production, while other Comecon member countries had already completed
industrialization long ago.

Secondly, [Vietnam]{.underline} was the [**last** country **to join
Comecon**,]{.underline} [at a time when]{.underline} the Soviet and
other [Comecon]{.underline} [economies]{.underline} had already
[fallen]{.underline} into serious stagnation, which
**[limited]{.underline}** their [capacity to help and **cooperate** with
Vietnam]{.underline}. From 1978 to 1987, the total amount of assistance
from Comecon members to Vietnam, a country with a population of 40
million, was equivalent to 2 billion US dollars. Assistance to Cuba,
with a population of 9 million, amounted to 4 billion.

Nevertheless, the assistance from the USSR and other Comecon countries
was very important and valuable for Vietnam during this critical period
by supplying food and other essential commodities as well as helping
Vietnam build the first power plants, factories, schools, and hospitals.
One of the most valuable assistances from Comecon was providing
scholarships and education to thousands of young Vietnamese
intellectuals.

Doi Moi, the Vietnamese term for the economic reforms initiated in 1986,
is credited with unleashing breakneck economic growth and a rapid rise
in the standard of living. But for many leftist critics, these
developments were little more than a return to capitalism and a break
with socialism. Is that a fair characterization?

No, that is not the case. Rather, it was [the CPV's recognition of
earlier mistakes in building socialism that laid the basic foundation
for the Doi Moi policy.]{.underline}

[On the surface]{.underline}, it may have [looked like Vietnam had
"stepped back" from the "socialist model]{.underline}" prevailing in the
USSR and Eastern Europe, which consisted mainly of centralized planning,
state and collective ownership of the forces of production, and equal,
subsidized distribution for all. [But]{.underline} we should not forget
that [there was a **big gap** in levels of **development** between
Vietnam and other Comecon members. Vietnam had just started the **first
phase** of the transition period **towards socialism**]{.underline},
whereas the European socialist countries had already accomplished this
long ago.

A lot has been written, including by myself, on why
[[capitalism]{.mark}, by its very nature, [**cannot** tackle]{.mark} or
stop [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. The purpose of this article
is not to repeat those arguments but to make the positive case for
socialism as necessary to deal with this existential crisis for
humanity.

By [socialism]{.underline} I mean simply [the combination of two things:
**public ownership** and **democratic control** of production and
society.]{.underline}

By public ownership I mean not the elimination of personal private
property or the nationalization of every small business and corner shop
but of the main banks, corporations, industries, services and utilities.
For example, public ownership of bus and transport networks, of the
health service, of one main state bank and one main state insurance
company, of social housing, of waste management, of water, electricity,
gas, wind and solar power production, of Larry Goodman's ABF Food Group,
of Denis O'Brien's Communicorp and so on.

By democratic control I mean that each major workplace --- each
hospital, factory, train station, school, university, construction
company etc. --- should be run by the elected and re-callable
representatives of its workforce, within the context of a democratic
plan for the economy and society as a whole. That would need to be
proposed by government based on and accountable to democratically
elected popular assemblies.

[[Without large scale public ownership,]{.mark} capitalism and [the laws
of the]{.mark} capitalist [market will **continue to dominate**
and]{.mark} this will [have disastrous consequences]{.mark} for the
environment]{.underline} as it has done already. [Without **democratic
control** you have not got socialism but state
capitalism]{.underline}\[1\] with a new ruling class of state
bureaucrats which, as has been seen in Stalinist Russia and in China,
also has terrible ecological consequences because it subordinates the
needs of the people and nature to accumulation for accumulation's sake
in competition with other states.

[[Only through socialism will it be possible to generate
both]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[political will]{.mark} at the top
[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} genuine [[popular
support]{.underline}]{.mark} and collaboration to achieve the immense
coordinated transformation of the national and international economy
[necessary]{.underline} in the current emergency. Only public ownership
and democratic planning can coordinate the establishment and expansion
of free public transport, the urgent transition to renewal energy, the
mass retrofitting of homes and a vast program of aforestation and
rewilding.

[Most]{.underline} of the climate and [[environmental movement
support]{.underline}]{.mark} the idea of [[a just transition but only
socialism with its commitment to ending class privilege]{.mark} and
inequality [can]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[deliver]{.mark}
this]{.underline}. In any society where there are billionaires alongside
homeless people, and immense divisions between rich countries and poor
countries as a result of imperialism and globalized capitalism, [[all
attempts at transition]{.mark} to ending carbon emissions]{.underline},
even where they are made, [[will inevitably be]{.mark} structured and
[blighted by]{.mark}]{.underline} this
**[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The rich will look to protect
themselves and their life styles in gated communities in the uplands
while trying to shift the burden of paying for the transition onto
ordinary people.

Take the example of transport. If, as is absolutely essential, we get
people out of the private car and onto free public transport, what will
be the consequences of this? Under capitalism it will mean the bosses of
the giant auto companies (Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors etc) will
see which way the wind is blowing, loot their own companies and put the
proceeds in their Swiss bank accounts, while throwing their hundreds of
thousands of workers on the scrap heap. Under socialism the auto
industry CEOs and big shareholders could be relieved of their ill-gotten
gains while the rundown of the industry is managed in a way that
retrains and re-employs the workers in socially useful work, e.g.
building wind turbines or buses.

The same applies to flying. If air travel were to be reduced, as it must
be to save the planet,\[2\] under capitalism this would most likely be
done by a price mechanism so that executives would continue to jet round
the world to their conferences while ordinary people had to give up
their holidays to Spain and the Greek Islands. That in turn would mean
redundancy for airline workers and crisis in the Spanish and Greek
tourist industry. Again only socialist planning could solve this.

And it would be the same for the utterly deadly coal industry. When
Margaret Thatcher destroyed the British coal industry in 1984-5 she did
it for entirely capitalist 'economic' reasons --- there wasn't an ounce
of environmentalism in it --- but the effect on mining communities and
villages was devastating; many have still not recovered. Avoiding such
communal destruction on a vastly greater scale requires socialist
planning.

[[Climate justice]{.mark} on a global scale [is]{.mark} totally
**[unthinkable without socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Five hundred
years ago the different continents and regions of the world were roughly
at the same level of economic development; for example, China was every
bit as economically advanced as Europe and India was seen as a rich
country. [[Centuries of capitalism]{.mark}, slavery and
imperialism]{.underline}, with the latter growing out of the former,
[[created an immensely uneven world]{.underline}]{.mark}; industrial
production, wealth and power became concentrated in the so-called
advanced 'West' --- essentially Europe and North America---with poverty,
starvation and lack of industrial development concentrated in Asia,
Africa and Latin America, now usually called the Global South.

This pattern has changed somewhat in recent decades with massive
capitalist development in China and other parts of South and East Asia
but it is still a massive reality across much of the world. Historically
and still today the [peoples of [Asia, Africa and Latin
America]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[contributed least]{.mark} to climate
change [but will be]{.mark}]{.underline} hugely [[disproportionately
affected]{.underline}]{.mark} by it. For example [a 1.5]{.underline}-2
[C global temperature increase will be a death sentence for much of
Africa]{.underline} because it will destroy their agriculture; melting
Himalayan glaciers and rising sea levels will utterly devastate the
deeply impoverished Bangladesh.

[[This cannot be challenged]{.mark} or dealt with [without]{.mark}
socialist **[redistribution]{.mark}** of wealth [and **socialist**
**planning**]{.mark} internationally]{.underline}. Only socialist
internationalism based on the common interests of the world's working
people could achieve such international cooperation[; [any capitalist
option, **no matter how 'green'**]{.underline}]{.mark} [its
intentions]{.underline}, [[would degenerate into]{.underline}]{.mark}
national and international [[rivalries which]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[destroy]{.underline}]{.mark} any coherent **[[international
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Then there is the question of overall economic growth. There is a
growing view in the environmental movement that [the idea of continuous
economic growth is completely unsustainable]{.underline}. Greta
Thunberg, in her speech to the UN, spoke of "fairy tales of eternal
economic growth."

But [[under capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} stagnation or, even more so,
[[de-growth is an immediate crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}, a recession
when it is short and a 'great depression' when it is extended,
[[spelling]{.mark} mass unemployment, [poverty and]{.mark}
austerity]{.underline} ([with the risk of [fascism]{.mark}]{.underline}
thrown in). This is because [[capitalism has a **drive to growth** built
into its very]{.mark} fabric]{.underline}. [Achieving [a non-growth
economy]{.mark}]{.underline} (measured in terms of GDP) or, should it
prove essential, a de-growth in certain areas
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**only be possible** on]{.mark} the
basis of [socialist planning]{.mark}]{.underline} combined with the
popular consent that would come from mass involvement in the democratic
planning process.

Then there is the fact that the proliferation of extreme weather events
associated with climate change has already begun, as is evident from the
numerous disasters currently observable round the world. This is clearly
going to intensify in the years ahead. Even in the event of a Damascene
conversion by the world's rulers --- of which there is no sign --- it is
unavoidable, due to the climate change already built into the system,
that we will see a dramatic escalation of 'natural' catastrophes ---
storms, floods, droughts, fires etc --- over the next 5-10 years. But we
know from abundant experience that the way capitalism responds to such
events is through a combination of crocodile tears (for a very short
while), followed by callous indifference and abandonment.

This pattern has repeated itself through the Bush Administration's
response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, to Superstorm
Sandy in 2012 under Obama and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. In
all of these cases all sorts of pledges of aid and reconstruction were
made in the immediate aftermath of disaster only for them to disappear
into thin air when it came to delivery. Years later people who lost
their homes and everything in them were still unable to return.¶ The
case of Hurricane Maria was particularly atrocious. Initially the death
toll was officially claimed to be 64. A year later it was admitted to be
2,975\[3\] and many critics argue that it was really much higher.
Bitterness at the appalling response to the Hurricane, by both the Trump
administration and the local governor, was a significant factor in the
great revolt of the Puerto Rican people earlier this year.¶ On a lesser
scale similar scenarios were played out over the Grenfell Fire and in
relation to flood victims in Ireland. Moreover, class and racial
privileges will continue to operate even within the extreme weather
events as happened with Katrina in New Orleans and the more frequent and
extensive these are the more this will be the case. The rich and white
will be saved, while the poor and black will be sacrificed and demonized
as 'dangerous looters'.¶ When we grasp the fact that escalating climate
change will make events like the California fires, Hurricane Dorian in
the Bahamas and flooding in Bangladesh a regular and ongoing occurrence
--- regardless of what is done to stop it now --- it is clear that a
socialist response at governmental and societal level is necessary to
cope with them and minimize the death toll and human suffering. In other
words we will need huge state intervention resting on popular
participation and solidarity to rescue the victims, feed the hungry and
house the homeless.¶ Speaking of housing the homeless it is worth noting
that rich societies such as the US, Britain and Ireland, operating on a
capitalist basis, cannot even do this in normal times: what will they be
like in time of catastrophe?¶ Moreover, rising temperatures and extreme
weather will inevitably increase the flow of refugees --- probably
massively so --- because swathes of the planet will cease to be
habitable, and in the next decade, not the end of the century. How will
the better placed countries respond? On the basis of a capitalist
economy, an economy based on the profit motive, it's hard to see how
there will be any even moderately humane response.¶ Again, [only a
socialist economy and society --- which harnesses the **collective
labor** and talents of all and understands that with every new person
comes a new and equal contributor to society regardless of nationality,
color or ethnicity --- will respond with **dignity** and
humanity]{.underline}.¶ Finally, some imagine that there might be a
third alternative, neither capitalism nor socialism, but a return to
some kind of pre-capitalist society based on small scale ecologically
sound self-sufficient villages or communes. Whatever one thinks of the
moral value of such communities as experiments or pre-figurations of
life in an imagined future, the fact is such a lifestyle is simply not
an option for the vast majority of ordinary people in our society and
will not and cannot gain any large scale popular take up any more than
did the phalansteres of the early nineteenth century (communes inspired
by French utopian socialist, Charles Fourier) or the hippy communes of
the sixties.¶ And when we think of a world of seven billion people in a
state of crisis, [the idea that]{.underline} such [a]{.underline}
'third' or ['deep green' alternative would be viable for the majority is
completely untenable]{.underline}. Are we saying the 100 million people
in Guangdong (the hyper industrialized and urbanized region of South
China) or the 24 million people of Shanghai should go back to rural
communes? This is literally not possible.¶ Only a solution in which the
100 million of Guandong or the 20 million of Mumbai or the eight million
of Paris or the one and half million of Dublin (together with all the
millions in smaller towns and in the countryside) take collective
ownership and control of the immense productive resources generated by
workers' labour under capitalism and move forward to a society based on
production for human need offers a real way forward for humanity.

Unfortunately there is a possible 'third alternative' to both socialism
and capitalist business as usual in a society in extreme crisis. That
alternative is fascism or some other form of ultra-right authoritarian
dictatorship. This would not abolish either class inequality or
capitalism but it might partially bring private capital under state
control and it would certainly abolish democracy, even in its current
very limited parliamentary form.

And in conditions of acute climate crisis it would mean, and would be
premised on, racist barbarity that globally would exceed that of the
holocaust and the Second World War. This has not happened yet but we see
a whiff of it with Trump, Bolsonaro and Salvini. Parliamentary democracy
and the limited democratic rights gained by working people should, of
course, be defended against this fascist threat but in the immense
crisis we are entering, capitalist business as usual will become less
and less a viable option.

### Alt\-\--Solves\-\--BioD 

#### Degrowth is key to [reverse]{.underline} bioD loss. 

**Ahern '23** \[Andrew; February 21; Ecological Organizer, Public
Educator "How Degrowth Can Help Reduce Global Conflict",
https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/online/how-degrowth-can-help-reduce-global-conflict/\]

Given these [technologies]{.underline} and [materials]{.underline} are
largely to [service]{.underline} the Global [North's]{.underline} [high
consumption]{.underline}, [a reduction in energy and material use by
rich nations would reduce the potential for environmental conflict in
the Global South]{.underline}. In addition to reducing conflict over the
minerals themselves, it would also help hasten our pursuit of a more
sustainable society, thereby [reducing]{.underline} the [impact of
climate change and environmental degradation]{.underline} in countries
like Nigeria or Pakistan, both of which experienced major floods this
past year.^11^ As research demonstrates, countries struck by
climate-induced disasters see a rise in authoritarian governments and
draconian policy shortly in the aftermath.^12^ A warming world spells
increased oppression among the world's poor both directly by ecological
disasters and how governments respond. Moreover, as the United Nations
International Resource Panel found, 90 percent of [biodiversity
loss]{.underline} and water stress are [caused]{.underline} [by the
extraction and processing of natural resources]{.underline}.^13^ A
[reduction in energy and material use would thus also reduce
biodiversity loss]{.underline}---another area of life-and-death struggle
for many (especially Indigenous people) in the Global
South.^14^ Degrowth increasingly appears as one of, if not the only,
Northern political programs that can avert ecological collapse, ensure
global justice, and provide everyone with good lives.

A scenario where [demand for production and consumption is reduced in
the Global North would allow Global South countries room for their own
development without having to]{.underline} service Northern growth or
[follow]{.underline} the [ecologically destructive path]{.underline} set
by the United States and Europe. [Degrowth]{.underline} seeks to
[reverse this unequal ecological exchange]{.underline} where the North
and South's resource use converge.^15^ In such a scenario, Global South
countries could focus on using their productive capacity and resources
to meet their own needs. For instance, according to the research by
Jason Hickel and colleagues, an estimate of roughly 43 percent of Global
North materials have come from the South. They state, "in 2015 the North
net appropriated from the South 12 billion tons of embodied raw material
equivalents, 822 million hectares of embodied land, 21 exajoules of
embodied energy, and 188 million person-years of embodied labor, worth
\$10.8 trillion in Northern prices---enough to end extreme poverty 70
times over. Over the whole period, drain from the South totalled \$242
trillion."^16^ Such an analysis, Hickel and his team claim, confirms
that [unequal ecological exchange is a significant driver of uneven
development, inequality, and ecological breakdown. A degrowth program
that is international in scope]{.underline} and decolonial in principle
[will lessen environmental damage]{.underline}, raise living standards
for billions of people, and provide some level of equality on the
world's stage.

It should be noted that [degrowth is not a zero-sum game]{.underline}
[where]{.underline} those in the Global [North]{.underline} [would be
"worse off]{.underline}" than before. In fact, life would be much better
for the global majority, whether you live in the United States or
Ecuador. While it can't be denied that degrowth would allow us to avert
ecological breakdown, the types of [policies]{.underline} and
provisioning systems [at the heart of the degrowth program
would]{.underline} put a special [emphasis on wellbeing and
sustainability in all countries]{.underline}. In [a degrowth
transition]{.underline}, as opposed to the "grow or die" ethos of modern
economics, [all people would have access to life's
necessities]{.underline}: healthcare, education, housing, energy,
internet---what some call a "social guarantee."^17^ Moreover, people
would work less and have more free time to enjoy friends, family, and
nature; people would buy less consumer goods since these items would
have repair mandates; people's health would improve due to less
pollution from fossil fuels and more plant-based diets as well. [There
is a bevy of research demonstrating how we can collectively live better
lives than we do now while reducing our use of energy and
materials]{.underline}.^18^

In the years since, [[Breakthrough's]{.mark} antics and [**loose

[most]{.underline} environmental [groups and]{.underline} climate change
[experts]{.underline} to [give them the **cold shoulder**]{.underline}.

"They had this idea of [molding environmentalism to attract

**[turned into conservatives]{.mark}** themselves]{.underline}---writing
for Forbes, Quillete, National Review, and the Wall Street Journal,"
said Sam Bliss a graduate student in environmental economics at the
University of Vermont. Along with research professor Giorgos Kallis,
Bliss published a study in the Journal of Political Ecology that
documents the [Breakthrough Institute's promotion of]{.underline} a
strange idea called **[ecomodernism]{.underline}**. Bliss describes it
as a tragic tale, where Nordhaus and Shellenberger [turn

environmental movement, ignoring them is not the smartest strategy. Most
of their early critics have vanished after becoming exasperated at the
group's [constant [**failure** to **correct

open license to peddle "ecomodernism" as a gadget to address the world's
environmental challenges.

Indeed, while it's been 12 years since Shellenberger and Lomborg shared

context of elections or central bank interest rates, [take for granted
that the **underlying goal** is to **facilitate** and **stimulate** the
overall economy. However, there has long been a faction of the
**environmental left** that **rejects** this goal]{.underline} outright.
[Undergirded by themes of catastrophic **resource
depletion** articulated by Thomas]{.underline} Malthus[ in the
**1700s**]{.underline} and later in the 1960s and 1970s in Paul
Ehrlich's The Population Bomb, and in the Club of Rome's The Limits to
Growth, [these circles have placed economic growth firmly in the
**crosshairs**, framing it not as a measure of society\'s **standard of
living** but rather as wasteful **self-destructive
consumption**]{.underline}.

[These views have persisted largely outside of the **mainstream**, but
they are enjoying a **resurgence** in recent years]{.underline}. In the
current context of a great deal of hyperbole on climate change impacts,
the [idea that reducing greenhouse gas **emissions** should **trump**
all **other concerns** and that economic growth is a **major enemy** in
this fight has become **fashionable** for **academics** and **climate
activists**]{.underline}. These arguments are often [intertwined with
**attacks** on capitalism, which is considered the system responsible
for **unsustainable growth**]{.underline} and all sorts of immorality.
This theme was apparent in the title of Naomi Klein's popular 2015
book Capitalism vs. The Climate, but momentum has been building since
then, represented by Kate Raworth's 2017 Doughnut Economics, Jason
Hickel's 2020Less is More, and Kohei Saito\'s 2024 Slow Down. Falling
under the umbrella of the Degrowth movement, Hickel and Saito argue for
a kind of world [communism]{.underline} that is [aimed **explicitly** at
**dismantling capitalism** and reducing global **economic
activity**]{.underline}. Though these ideas may seem quite extreme to
the average person, they are receiving increasingly favorable coverage
in venues such as the New York Times and Nature, and they are being
bolstered by a perception of credibility from a rapidly expanding field
of academic research (that is, in fact, quite flawed).

Because the hostility towards both economic productivity (framed as
wasteful consumption) and personal economic freedom in the form of
capitalism seem to be ever in the background and enjoying a resurgence,
it's worth revisiting, from first principles, why both [**economic
productivity** and **capitalism**]{.underline} [are **assets**, not
liabilities in the context of general human **material well-being** and
in the context of **climate**]{.underline}.

In Part 1, I'll look at the case of adapting to climate and climate
change, specifically how **[private property]{.underline}**,
**[markets]{.underline}**, and **[trade]{.underline}** (i.e.,
capitalism) tend to be [great at facilitating
**productivity**]{.underline}, and this, in turn, [results in the
societies that are **least vulnerable** to climate]{.underline} and
climate change. In Part 2, I'll look at how [**capitalism** and the
**economic** and **technological progress** it propels are **essential**
for the eventual **elimination** of greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}.

Part 1: [**Adaptation** to Climate]{.underline}

The [degrowth movement **asserts** that we can only]{.underline} hope to
[address our climate challenges by **reducing** economic activity to
reduce]{.underline} greenhouse gas [**emissions** and other **resource
draws**]{.underline} on the earth, typically through some form of global
control of the economy. [However, this would be incredibly
**counterproductive**]{.underline} for climate adaptation [as it would
**dismantle** the **primary phenomena** responsible for increasing the
human material standard of living that **fortifies us**]{.underline}
against our often hostile climate.

Economic [productivity is typically measured with **g**]{.underline}ross
**[d]{.underline}**omestic **[p]{.underline}**roduct (GDP) [per
capita]{.underline} (the total per-person monetary value of all goods
and services produced). GDP per capita is a popular target of critics.
It is certainly an imperfect measure of total human well-being, but it
[represents a **good proxy** for a society\'s **material** standard of
living]{.underline}. In fact, GDP per capita is [**strongly correlated**
with many outcomes almost **universally** considered **socially
desirable**, including higher **life expectancy**, lower **child
mortality**, higher **educational attainment**, fewer **working hours**,
and higher self-reported **life satisfaction**]{.underline}.

[\<FIGURE OMITTTED\>]{.underline}

Furthermore, we see a [**strong relationship** between GDP per capita
and **reduced vulnerability** to climate]{.underline} over space and
time. Over time, [almost all **climate-sensitive** aspects of society
have been trending in **generally positive directions** as GDP per
capita has **increased**. Over space, death rates from **natural
disasters** like **floods**, **droughts**, and **storms** are **15
times** higher for **low-productivity** countries]{.underline} than they
are for high-productivity countries, and **[disaster
damages]{.underline}** as a percentage of exposed GDP are [much lower in
**high-productivity** nations]{.underline}. Finally, there is a
[**strong across-country** relationship between GDP per capita and
measures of climate change **adaptive capacity**]{.underline}, such as
the University of Notre Dame's climate adaptation Readiness Score.

[\<FIGURE OMITTTED\>]{.underline}

While the [**underlying productivity** of a society is the
**foundation**, governments play a **critical role** in providing the
fundamental **infrastructure**]{.underline} and systems related to
energy, transport, communication, health, and education [that are
**upstream** of **resilience** to the climate. The **well-resourced**
governments of high-productivity economies are also able to provide
**many services** that are more **directly related** to **climate
adaptation**]{.underline}. For example, the [US has the luxury of
supporting **advanced weather** and **climate prediction
centers**]{.underline} like the National Center for Environmental
Prediction (NCEP); it has agencies like the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), which coordinates disaster preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts; it has agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers which
designs, builds, and maintains large-scale flood protection; it has
agencies like the U.S. Forest Service Fire and Aviation Management
Program which fights forest fires, and it has agencies like the United
States Department of Agriculture which spends billions annually on
research and development (and should probably spend more) that has
supported breakthroughs in crop varieties, precision farming
technologies, and improved fertilizers. These are all nominally
government programs, but they are ultimately [tied to the
**productivity** of the **private sector** that **funds** these
endeavors. Furthermore, all these programs **buy** the **tools** they
use]{.underline} (vehicles, airplanes, computers, software, construction
materials, bulldozers, etc.) [from the private sector]{.underline}, and
much of the public R&D is commercialized and implemented via private
entities.

The Facilitator of Economic Productivity

[Throughout the **vast majority** of **human history**, **material
poverty** and **extreme sensitivity** to the **whims** of the climate
were the **universal state** of the world]{.underline}. As measured in
GDP per capita, [there was virtually **no economic growth** until the
**commercial revolution** in the late Middle Ages, when **economic
trade** began to better facilitate **productivity** and
**innovation**]{.underline}. As the 19th-century economist Frédéric
Bastiat noted, "[In the absence of trade and production, **life itself**
would be **impossible**]{.underline}. [Nature does not supply us with
**ready-made products**, but only with the materials from which we must
**fashion** the **means** of our **existence**]{.underline}."

[In recent centuries and decades, humanity has been **rapidly**
becoming materially **much better off**]{.underline}. The [average
person]{.underline} alive today is [approximately **five times
richer** than the average person in **1950**]{.underline}, with
[**parallel declines** in the share of the **global population** in
**extreme poverty**]{.underline}. So, what is the engine behind this
explosion in economic productivity? As Adam Smith famously observed,
[**productivity** is **greatly enhanced** by the system that we now call
**capitalism**]{.underline}. In particular, in a [system where
individuals]{.underline} and firms [know they can own, control, and
**disproportionately benefit** from **disproportionate productivity**,
they are **incentivized** to **work harder**]{.underline}, think more
creatively, and invest their money and their time (including investment
in themselves) more wisely. [Even **Karl Marx** emphasized that
**capitalist competition** amongst private firms is **largely
responsible** for stimulating the **technological change** that
increases **productivity**]{.underline} (in terms of production per hour
of labor).

In recent history, examples such as the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[Germany]{.underline}**,
**[Switzerland]{.underline}**, and [**Japan** show the **success**
of **mixed economies**]{.underline} or "welfare-state capitalism" [with
significant **government intervention** but robust **private sectors**
embracing capitalism]{.underline}. In stark contrast, [**fully planned**
command economies have a **track record** of failure]{.underline}. Some
of the 20th century\'s more famous examples include
the [Soviet]{.underline} Union's **[economic stagnation]{.underline}**,
the economic and human [**disaster** of **Mao Zedong\'s**
centralized attempt to collectivize **Chinese
agriculture**]{.underline}, and the [contrast of **economic success** in
capitalist **West Germany** compared to socialist **East Germany**. More
recently, **Venezuela's** expansion of socialism has been marked by
**economic decline** and **crisis**]{.underline}.

Of course, various economic systems spanning the range from more
market-oriented to those with much stronger levels of state intervention
and control have been implemented, and more laissez-faire is not
necessarily better. South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore provide examples
of rapid economic development in the latter half of the 20th under
autocratic rulers who used formal economic planning. However, this
planning relied on incentives and support not dictatorial mandates, and
the vast majority of the economies in these countries remained under
private control.

Overall, the field of developmental economics has continually
identified strong institutions that enforce property rights and allow
for open markets and free trade as critical facilitators of
productivity. In systems where a government ensures that property rights
are secure, individuals are free to specialize in the areas where they
have the most skill or interest, and this specialization leads to
greater efficiency and productivity as people focus on what they do best
with an eye to producing what their fellow citizens desire most.
Competition is the key to driving efficiency and innovation, so
governments also play a critical role by inhibiting monopolies and price
fixing.

Critically, freely fluctuating prices reflect people's needs and
realistic production constraints without explicit calculation. What's
produced is determined by the prices people are willing to pay for
products, and prices for raw materials, labor, loans, rent, and other
costs determine the most efficient way of producing those products.
These same prices determine how much each person has to spend in the
market. Prices vary and thus reflect changing conditions. When a
desirable product becomes scarce, its price rises, which stimulates more
resources to flow towards producing that product (or substitutes for
that product), reducing the scarcity.

These dynamics are why a strong association exists between a country\'s
degree of economic freedom and its economic productivity, and there is
good evidence that this relationship is causal. Below, the current
across-country relationship is visualized using GDP per capita and
economic freedom estimated by the Fraser Institute's Economic Freedom
Index (which gives points for, e.g., the security of private property
rights, freedom to trade internationally, and penalties for, e.g.,
government ownership of industry and overregulation of business).

[\<FIGURE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

Finally, since economic freedom is associated with economic productivity
and we saw above that economic productivity is associated with climate
adaptation readiness, it is not surprising that there is also a strong
across-country relationship between economic freedom, and climate
adaptation readiness.

[\<FIGURE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

Source: Economic Freedom Index from the Fraser Institute, Adaptation
Readiness from the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation
Initiative. All 161 countries with all three indices are plotted, and
the data is for the most recent common year of 2021.

Overall, the three-way positive association between economic
productivity, economic freedom, and climate change adaptation readiness
indicates that the market-based, high-productivity societies of the
world are those that not only have the best current protection from the
climate but those that will be the most agile in their adaptation to
climate change.

The Agility of Capitalism in Climate Adaptation

In his defense of a command economy, Karl Marx articulated that only
that which is planned is rational. When it came to attempts to implement
Marx's ideas, the most consequential hurdle has been finding benevolent
autocrats and planners. However, more relevant to the issue of climate
adaptation was Marx's supposition that technocratic planners could have
sufficient information and knowledge to be effectively rational, even if
they were benevolent. In contrast, Ludwig von Mises argued in 1920
that "socialism is the abolition of rational economy," making the case
that without private ownership and free-market pricing mechanisms, there
is no way of calculating the most "rational" allocation of resources. A
survey of the landscape of climate adaptive measures in productive
economies lends much more support to von Mises than to Marx.

For example, as Anderson et al. discuss in their 2018 paper The Critical
Role of markets in climate adaptation, [markets]{.underline} in
agriculture [**effectively signal** emerging climate risks, prompting
**adjustments** such as changes in **cropping patterns**, **irrigation
practices**, and even the **geographic shift** of agricultural
production to **less vulnerable** areas]{.underline}. If certain crops
become less viable in one region, they can be grown elsewhere and traded
on the global market, mediating any effect on the total food supply.
This is a specific example of the more general principle of Ricardian
comparative advantage, where, in this case, [capitalism]{.underline}
[**naturally facilitates** the **efficient distribution** of
**production**]{.underline} across the globe, allowing regions to
specialize in the goods and services for which they are best suited.

[Prices for **labor** (i.e., wages) also **facilitate adaptation** to
climate change. As **new challenges** arise, the **demand** for certain
skills and occupations **changes**, creating **incentives** for workers
to acquire **new skills** and **transition** into industries critical
for **climate adaptation**]{.underline}. For example, in agriculture,
the need for agronomists and environmental scientists to develop and
implement new climate-resilient practices may increase, driving labor
toward these areas.

These [dynamics tend to be mediated through **private
firms**]{.underline}. John Deere, for example, has been behind the
[development of **numerous machines** that have improved **crop
productivity**]{.underline}, including recent [**precision
agriculture** aided by **GPS-guided** tractors and other "**smart
farming**" equipment that allows farmers to better optimize
**planting**, **irrigation**, and **harvesting**]{.underline}. Firms
like Nutrien and Yara International have developed advanced
fertilizers that increase crop productivity, and companies like
Bayer have innovated in gene editing, facilitating the creation of
drought-resistant and pest-resistant crops.

Still a "proud and committed" capitalist, he argues that "[**markets**
are the **quickest way** for human beings to change things at
**scale**," whether that applies to **oil** and **tobacco** or **clean
drinking water** and **vaccines**]{.underline}. Markets, he writes, are
amoral. And [for a long time, fossil fuels **ruled**]{.underline}. But
now, Steyer sees the world at a turning point. As he told me over Zoom
in April, "[**cleaner** is cheaper." And for **wealthy
investors**]{.underline}, himself included, [doing the "**right thing**"
by funding **green solutions** can also be **profitable**]{.underline}.

"Part business book, part climate manifesto, part memoir," as his
marketing team described it, Cheaper, Faster, Better reads as one long
monologue in which Steyer argues that readers should become, like him,
"climate people" and incorporate climate into "every big decision you
make." Throughout, he compares our fight against climate change to World
War II: The question, "'What are you doing to fight climate change?\'"
he writes, "is the 'What did you do in the war?' of our time."

In a wide-ranging, 45-minute conversation, I asked Steyer about his
views on carbon--footprint shaming, celebrities like Taylor Swift flying
private, and what the super-wealthy owe the world. You can read an
edited and condensed version of our conversation below.

You write about capitalism's role in addressing the climate crisis. But
[capitalism is part of the reason we **got into** this **mess**. Why do
you still **trust it** to work now]{.underline}?

[When you think about capitalism's role in society, capitalism
**scales**. And the organizations that solve society's **needs** and
**wants** are **profit-driven** businesses. But it is **absolutely
essential** that the **rules** be set up in society so that even
**self-interested** individuals]{.underline} and organizations [do
what's in **society's interest**]{.underline}.

I think we're [at a point where the **interest** of business will be in
providing **sustainable answers**, both because of the **rules** that
government has put in, and the programs like the **I**nflation
**R**eduction **A**ct that are **designed** to say to people who are
**profit-oriented**, "Build this. This is what our **society
needs**]{.underline}."

I think that business has to have frameworks from the government, and
from, in effect, the will of the people to build the things that society
needs. That's how it's supposed to work. That's why I think the engine
of getting this done will be capitalism, but it's got to be within that
framework. Carrots and sticks are critical.

[If there are **rules** and **incentives**, and it's in investors'
**best interest** to pay attention to **climate change**, as you argue
in the book, why do so many **still** put their money into fossil
fuels]{.underline}?

I think that it's pretty simple. [They're betting on the **status quo**.
They're **making money**, a lot of money, from **oil** and **gas** right
now]{.underline}. And they're betting that that won't change.

[If something can't go on **forever**, eventually, it **must stop**. And
that's where we are in **fossil fuels**. The status quo **cannot keep
going**. In the last 10 months, every single \[month\] has been the
**hottest month** in recorded history]{.underline}. We're on a
[trajectory]{.underline} in terms of emissions and air
temperature and ocean temperature [that is **absolutely
unsustainable**]{.underline}. We need to make this change. And now
[we're at a place where, technologically, it's to our
**advantage**]{.underline}. Eighty-six percent of the new electricity
generation in the world last year was renewable, for example.

There's the old Hemingway quote, "How did you go bankrupt? Two ways:
slowly, and then all at once." [New technologies will slowly **eat
away** at the **status quo**, until then, all of a sudden, they **go
vertical**]{.underline}.

[When we talk about the **tension** between **climate** and
**capitalism**, one of the things that we try to wrestle with is the
**growth imperative**]{.underline}, which is the fundamental engine of
capitalism. But that engine is also part of what's driving us toward the
cliff on climate.

There isn't one answer to this problem. It's too big, too complicated,
\[and\] geographically varied. What resources countries have, what
politics they have all vary. There isn't one solution that's going to
solve this.

You're getting a [lot of people throwing **different ideas** about what
**might work**. One of those ideas is **degrowth**]{.underline}. Within
degrowth, there are many ways of doing it, but perhaps the most
reasonable one is [rich countries **degrow**]{.underline} --- they
actually shrink [their **economies**, **consume less**, \[to\] allow for
a **finite carbon budget** for our climate goals to be used up by
**developing countries** to **grow** their economies and become
**richer**]{.underline}.

The [trouble is that the **politics** of degrowth are **very hard**.
America doesn't have **carbon pricing** federally. You try and get oil
to go above **\$4 a gallon** and there's a **revolt**]{.underline}.
That's very cheap oil; \$4 a gallon is dirt-cheap oil for Europeans
\[and\] for Indians, who are paying a lot more for the petrol they put
in their cars.

The political nature of degrowth is difficult, but [fundamentally, there
is a **problem** with the idea]{.underline}. There's a famous phrase
you'll hear at a climate protest, which is "[How can you have **infinite
growth** on a **finite planet**?" It's true on a **material level**, but
it's not true in the **energy sense**. We're **bathed** by **solar
power** 24-7]{.underline}.

["Growth" is not just **material growth**. Growth is how you **use**
your energy]{.underline}. For example, [under]{.underline} the [current
known **scenarios** of reaching **net zero** by 2050, we will actually
be consuming **half** the amount of **energy** we consume today at
**three times** the **economy** in 2050, because a lot of our growth
will come from **electrification**]{.underline}.

As we know, [electrification drives **efficiency**. Your electric car is
going **four times** the distance for the **same amount** of energy that
you would put in a fossil fuel car]{.underline}. Same thing is true of
heat pumps.

[There are some **material** resource limitations, but there's **no
limit** on the **amount of energy** we can use]{.underline}. It's about
how to make that system work together. That's what we need to solve. The
argument is to use energy, but use clean energy rather than fossil
fuel-based energy to be able to drive the system.

#### Rebounds are [miniscule]{.underline} and Jevon's paradox [isn't applicable]{.underline} to modern energy consumption and economic markets\-\--empirics AND experts [agree]{.underline}.

**Rosalsky '25** \[Greg; February 4; Economics Policy commentator for

from Stanford; NPR, "Why the AI world is suddenly obsessed with a

nikhil

It was within this context that economists rediscovered the Jevons
paradox. And they created a modern formulation that\'s a bit more
nuanced. The idea is that making things like cars and appliances more
energy efficient creates a \"rebound effect.\" When you make a machine
more energy efficient, it effectively lowers the cost of using it. And
--- hello, the classic law of demand from economics --- when stuff gets
cheaper, people tend to use or consume more of it.

So, for example, with more-fuel-efficient cars, it gets cheaper to
travel every mile, so people drive more miles. Some may decide to stop
riding the bus and buy a car. Some families may buy a second car. Others
may buy bigger vehicles, like SUVs. With more-efficient light bulbs,
people may keep their lights on for longer or build things like the
Sphere in Las Vegas.

The rebound effect from greater energy efficiency reduces the
environmental benefits of energy-efficient technologies.

Now, [there\'s **nothing paradoxical** about stuff getting cheaper and
demand going up]{.underline}. That\'s classic economics. And if [the
**rebound** effect is **small**, then **gains** in energy **efficiency**
will still lead to a **reduction** in overall energy consumption. There
is **no** real **Jevons paradox**]{.underline} unless energy demand
dramatically explodes in response to the lower energy costs of
more-efficient machines.

There has been a lot of debate over how big rebound effects actually are
in various energy markets. [As far as we can tell, it seems like **most
economists** who analyze this closely find that]{.underline}, generally
speaking, [**rebound** effects in **modern** energy markets tend to be
rather **small**]{.underline}. They\'re like, sure, the rebound effect
is real and it dilutes the environmental benefits of greater energy
efficiency, but [it **doesn\'t come close** to completely **canceling**
them out]{.underline}. So, for example, if I buy a Prius, maybe I\'ll go
on more road trips or whatever, but that doesn\'t negate all the fuel
savings over the vehicle\'s lifetime. Studies suggest that
[energy-**efficient vehicles** and appliances still, **on net**, result
in **lower** energy consumption]{.underline}.

But others stress that the ripple effects of more-energy-efficient
technologies are harder to measure. They argue that, when you look at
the bigger picture of how demand explodes in response to cheaper energy,
estimates of rebound effects have been too small. In some cases, they
argue, the rebound effect can be so big that increasing something\'s
efficiency can backfire, resulting in greater overall energy consumption
--- the very paradox that Jevons wrote about.

In a 2010 article in The New Yorker, \"The Efficiency Dilemma,\"
journalist David Owen made a big deal out of the Jevons paradox in the
modern world. He pointed to what happened after refrigerators became
more energy efficient during his lifetime. Some Americans began buying
multiple refrigerators for their homes. Hotels began putting
mini-fridges in every room. \"Gas stations now often have almost as much
refrigerated shelf space as the grocery stores of my early childhood,\"
he wrote. [More-**efficient refrigeration** also encouraged people to
**buy more food**, because they could keep it **longer**, and that often
leads to food **waste**, another energy cost]{.underline}. This
refrigeration technology was also adopted in air conditioners, and those
have similarly proliferated in cars, homes and buildings around the
world. All of this, Owen suggests, has resulted in a massive rebound
effect where maybe more-energy-efficient refrigeration technology has
actually resulted in overall higher energy consumption.

**[However]{.underline}**, U.K. journalist Tim Harford (a frequent
guest of Planet Money) writes that Owen blows this all out of
proportion. Sure, there are real rebound effects. But, he writes,
[\"]{.underline}In my lifetime, [energy **consumption** per
person]{.underline} in the UK [has **fallen** by **one-third**, while
carbon dioxide **emissions** per person have **fallen** by nearly **60
per cent**.\"]{.underline}

In short, [the **extreme** version of **Jevons paradox** in today\'s
energy markets may be **BS**]{.underline}. Very likely, greater
efficiency does not lead to greater consumption of fossil fuels. But
maybe [that\'s because **today\'s economy** is **unlike** the economy of
**Jevon\'s lifetime**]{.underline}, when England was experiencing rapid,
coal-powered industrialization. [These days, gains in **efficiency** and
resulting **reductions** in energy costs **don\'t** result in the same
**explosion** of energy demand]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--Innovation\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Capitalism is [self-correcting]{.underline} and the [only]{.underline} system that drives technological and [sustainable]{.underline} innovation through the sustainment of a high standard of living and profit [incentives]{.underline}.

I showed that [higher-income countries tend to be the ones that are most
economically free and thus [capitalistic]{.mark}, and it is these
[countries]{.mark} that [are **best suited to**]{.mark}]{.underline}
build [infrastructure, **[respond to climate disasters]{.mark}**, and
have systems in place that are generally robust to our often hostile
climate]{.underline}. I argued that [**[capitalistic competition
undergirds]{.mark}** the **[technological innovation]{.mark}** that
[causes]{.mark} direct **[climate adaptation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
such as driving forward air conditioning, and supports the large tax
base that produces nominally government-supported adaptation efforts
like public infrastructure, early warning systems, and disaster response
efforts.

In Part 2, I make the case that, just as [[capitalism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an asset for climate adaptation, it is also a
[**[key to transitioning]{.mark}** to a sustainable low-carbon economy
[while]{.mark} simultaneously [facilitating a high]{.mark} material
**[standard of living.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One useful framework for thinking about drivers of global CO2 emission
is the Kaya Identity, which breaks down human-caused CO2 emissions (from
the energy system) into four fundamental components:

These four terms are multiplied so, theoretically, if any one of them
were to go to zero, then human-caused CO2 emissions associated with the
energy system would also go to zero. [Thus, we could eliminate
anthropogenic CO2 emissions and largely halt climate change by reducing
the human population to zero, economic production to zero, by magically
producing goods and services without energy, or by [harnessing energy
without emitting CO2.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This last term is the only one that **[could plausibly and desirably go
to zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, the Degrowth Movement also
heavily emphasizes putting downward pressure on all the other terms,
especially economic productivity driven by capitalism. This emphasis is
not without some logic because, historically, global CO2 emissions have
been increasing, and they have been driven up primarily by an increase
in population and economic productivity (this is despite increases in
energy efficiency and reductions in carbon intensity of energy).

However, attempting to force down economic productivity in order to
reduce CO2 emissions is parochial and misguided because [[it is actually
**economic productivity itself**]{.mark} that puts downward pressure on
all the other terms, [making a **sustainable society more
plausible**]{.mark} in the long term.]{.underline}

[In order [to achieve]{.mark} an [indefinitely sustainable
society]{.mark} on earth, it is fair to argue that the [human
**population would need to stabilize**]{.mark} at some
level]{.underline}. Some environmentalists have long advanced the notion
that the human population will increase exponentially as long as it has
resources to consume, much like bacteria in a petri dish. In this model,
population can only be stabilized through the blunt force of running out
of resources, or it can be stabilized preemptively via top-down coercive
policies that discourage reproduction.

But this model is wrong. Humans do not simply multiply uncontrollably
until they consume all resources. In fact[, It turns out that [as
societies become materially better off, **fertility rates**]{.mark}
**tend to [decline]{.mark}** naturally. This phenomenon apparently
results from a multitude of factors associated with economic
productivity]{.underline}, including increased access to education,
especially for women, improved healthcare, and reduced child mortality
rates. But [capitalism has also played a more direct role as [it is
**the most decentralized and capitalist economies** that]{.mark} tends
to **[have the lowest fertility rates]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

One reason for this is that in capitalist systems, women have far
greater motivation and incentives to invest in their human capital or
career prospects. The disproportionate purchasing power that results
from disproportionate investment in professional development motivates
many women to prioritize careers over having larger families.

In addition to cultural drivers, the more proximate mechanism that
greatly facilitates lower fertility rates---birth control largely in the
form of oral contraception---has been driven forward by capitalism. The
first birth control pill, Envoid, was developed in the 1950s by the G.D.
Searle & Company. Since the introduction of Enovid, [innovation in
contraception has continued to advance as pharmaceutical companies have
developed lower-dose birth control pills with reduced side
effects]{.underline}. Bayer and Merck have developed IUDs that compete
with birth control pills, and recently, there has been innovation in
non-hormonal options, male contraception, and digital health
technologies for tracking fertility. [These [innovations]{.mark} were
not the result of a government mandate or concern for the environment,
but rather [result]{.mark}ed [from private firms correctly **identifying
market opportunities**]{.mark} to **generate profit.**]{.underline}

[[Increasing the **energy efficiency**]{.mark} of the economy means
**using less energy** to produce the same amount of economic output, and
this **can be [achieved]{.mark} [through technological
advancements]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} more efficient production processes,
and a larger share of GDP coming from services rather than physical
goods]{.underline}.

[In a decentralized capitalistic economy, [private **firms**]{.mark}
seek to **[maximize profits]{.mark}** [by competing]{.mark} to offer
goods and services at the lowest possible price. In this system, a penny
saved is a penny earned, so a key lever for increasing profit is to
reduce input costs to the production process]{.underline}. Since energy
costs money, firms have an incentive to reduce direct energy expenditure
as well as the embedded energy in the physical inputs to their
production process. Furthermore, [[consumers have an **incentive to
demand products that are energy efficient**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nobody
wants a TV that will double their monthly electricity bill.

The story of the modern smartphone, summarized by Andrew McAfee in More
from Less, demonstrates this phenomenon. He highlights that the
smartphone is a single compact device that replaces 13 out of 15 devices
advertised in a 1991 Radio Shack ad.

[This consolidation represents not only a reduction in physical
materials, but also in the energy required to produce these
services]{.underline}--not to mention the simultaneously increased
quality of the services. Additionally, the brick-and-mortar RadioShack
itself has been put out of business by more efficient means of shopping
for and obtaining these services.

The creative destruction of all of these now-obsolete devices, and their
retailer RadioShack, was not driven by a top-down mandate on energy
efficiency, but rather by entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs (in the case of
the smartphone) and Jeff Bezos (in the case of the demise of RadioShack)
operating in a [**[competitive capitalistic environment]{.mark}** that
[**demands innovation** in efficiency]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[These [dynamics]{.mark} even **[foster reductions in energy]{.mark}**
use via the reuse of goods]{.underline}. Profit-seeking companies like
Facebook have developed services like Facebook Marketplace that greatly
facilitate the transfer of items between individuals, effectively
extending their lifetimes and reducing waste and the demand to create
new items.

The above are specific examples, but they are representative of broader
trends observable at the aggregate economic level. [[In the
highest-income countries]{.mark}, which also tend to be the most
economically free, [we have seen]{.mark} peaks and subsequent
**[decreases in energy consumption]{.mark}** not only per unit of GDP,
but also on a per-person basis.]{.underline}

The motivation for creating the iPhone, Amazon, Facebook Marketplace (as
well as the motivation to participate in Facebook Marketplace), and
[widespread **[efficiency innovations]{.mark}** **[across]{.mark} all
sectors of free [capitalistic economies]{.mark}** is not primarily a
desire to reduce environmental impacts. Yet, the [result]{.mark} has
been an increase **[in efficiency]{.mark} so great** [that]{.mark} many
more [people have access to]{.mark} much **[higher-quality goods]{.mark}
and services**, even as absolute resource and energy use has
decreased.]{.underline}

These [[innovations came]{.mark} about [from]{.mark} people acting in
their own **[economic self-interest]{.mark}** within an institutional
environment **where private property** and freely fluctuating prices
**signal supply and demand and**, thus, the most **efficient use of
fundamentally scarce resources**]{.underline}. Therefore, this progress
comes about because of, not in spite of, economic self-interest. Yet in
top-down communist regimes advocated for within the Degrowth movement,
these price signals and economic self-interest would be abolished or
severely thwarted, relying instead on technocratic control of production
through coercion. As examples like the Soviet Union, China in the middle
of the 20th century, North Korea, East Germany, and Venezuela have
shown, this has historically proven to result in tremendous
inefficiencies and a lack of incentive to innovate.

[**[Carbon intensity]{.mark} of energy [can be reduced]{.mark}** by
deploying carbon capture and storage technologies and shifting from
burning fossil fuels to energy sources like nuclear, hydro, wind, solar,
and geothermal. Carbon intensity of energy is the only term in the Kaya
Identity that could plausibly and desirably go to zero, and thus, it
must play a central role in the discussion.]{.underline}

[Global carbon intensity of energy has been **[decreasing]{.mark}
gradually [since the 1960s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The overall
environment in which this is fostered is summarized in More from Less as
having [the four elements of 1) [capitalism]{.mark}, 2) technological
progress, 3) an informed public, and 4) responsive government. Publicly
funded science [led to]{.mark} the discovery and subsequent **[public
awareness of]{.mark} the [climate change]{.mark}** problem, which in
turn has led to]{.underline} democratically elected officials
[implementing government policies supporting R&D and commercialization
of energy technologies that reduce the carbon intensity of energy.
Ultimately, however, the **[technological progress necessary]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} offer **[low-carbon energy]{.mark} at affordable prices** is
and **[will be driven by capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[**[In]{.mark} competitive [capitalistic environments]{.mark}**, [energy
producers]{.mark} attempt to **[reduce costs]{.mark} [and improve
efficiency]{.mark}** to improve their prospects of securing government
contracts and partnerships with utilities. [Venture
capitalists]{.mark}]{.underline}, [motivated by the potential for high
returns, [fund these efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, betting on various
technologies\' potential to meet future energy demands. As Thomas
Friedman eloquently put it, "It\'s very hard to get a generation living
today to make major sacrifices for a generation yet to be born, and
that's why you also need the profit motive."

//vo)

[**[The past 30 years]{.mark} have [seen]{.mark}** immense progress in
**[improving]{.mark}** the **[quality of life]{.mark}** for much of
humanity. **[Extreme poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- the number of
people living on less than \$1.90 per day [--- **[has fallen]{.mark}**
by nearly two-thirds, from 1.9 billion to around 650
million]{.underline}. [**[Life expectancy has risen]{.mark}** in most of
the world, along with literacy and access to education, while infant
mortality has fallen]{.underline}. Despite perceptions to the contrary,
[the average person born today is likely to have access to more
opportunities and have a better quality of life than at any other point
in human history]{.underline}. Much of [**this [increase in human
wellbeing]{.mark}** has been **[propelled by rapid economic
growth]{.mark}** [driven]{.mark} largely [by]{.mark} state-led
[industrial policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in poor-to-middle
income countries.

However[, this growth has come at a cost]{.underline}: between 1990 and
2019, global emissions of CO2 increased by 56%. Historically, economic
growth has been closely linked to increased energy consumption --- and
increased CO2 emissions in particular --- leading some to argue that a
more prosperous world is one that necessarily has more impacts on our
natural environment and climate. There is a lively academic debate about
our ability to "absolutely decouple" emissions and growth --- that is,
the extent to which the adoption of clean energy technology can allow
emissions to decline while economic growth continues.

Over the past 15 years, [however, something has begun to
change.]{.underline} Rather than a 21st century dominated by coal that
energy modelers foresaw, [**[global coal use peaked]{.mark}** in 2013
and is now in structural decline. **[We]{.mark} have [succeeded in
making]{.mark} [clean]{.mark} [energy cheap]{.mark}**, with solar power
and battery storage costs falling 10-fold since 2009. The world produced
more electricity from clean energy --- solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear
--- than from coal over the past two years]{.underline}. And, according
to some major oil companies, peak oil is upon us --- not because we have
run out of cheap oil to produce, but because [**[demand is
falling]{.mark} and companies expect further decline** as consumers
increasingly shift to electric vehicles.]{.underline}

[[The world]{.mark} [has]{.mark} long [been experiencing]{.mark} a
**[relative decoupling]{.mark}** between economic growth and CO2
emissions, with the emissions per unit of GDP falling for the past 60
years. This is the case **[even in]{.mark} countries like [India and
China]{.mark}** that have been undergoing rapid economic
growt]{.underline}h. But relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a
world where global CO2 emissions need to peak and decline in the next
decade to give us any chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in
line with Paris Agreement targets.

Thankfully, [there is increasing evidence that **[the world is on track
to absolutely decouple]{.mark} CO2 emissions and economic
growth**]{.underline} --- [with global CO2 emissions potentially having
peaked in 2019 and unlikely to increase substantially in the coming
decade]{.underline}. While an emissions peak is just the first and
easiest step towards eventually reaching the net-zero emissions required
to stop the world from continuing to warm, [it demonstrates that
linkages between emissions and economic activity are not an immutable
law, but rather simply a result of our current means of energy
production]{.underline}.

[In recent years **we have seen more** and more **examples of absolute
decoupling**]{.underline} --- [economic growth accompanied by falling
CO2 emissions]{.underline}. Since 2005, 32 countries with a population
of at least one million people have absolutely decoupled emissions from
economic growth, both for terrestrial emissions (those within national
borders) and consumption emissions (emissions embodied in the goods
consumed in a country). [**[This includes the United States]{.mark},**
Japan, Mexico, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain]{.underline},
Poland, Romania, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary,
Belarus, Austria, Bulgaria, El Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland,
Slovakia, Norway, Ireland, New Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania,
Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, and Cyprus. Figure 1, below, shows the
declines in territorial emissions (blue) and increases in GDP (red).

To qualify as having experienced absolute decoupling, we require
countries included in this analysis to pass four separate filters: a
population of at least one million (to focus the analysis on more
representative cases), declining territorial emissions over the
2005-2019 period (based on a linear regression), declining consumption
emissions, and increasing real GDP (on a purchasing power parity basis,
using constant 2017 international \$USD). We chose not to include 2020
in this analysis because it is not particularly representative of
longer-term trends, and consumption and territorial emissions estimates
are not yet available for many countries.

[There is a wide range of rates of economic growth between 2005-2019
among countries experiencing absolute decoupling. Somewhat
counterintuitively, [there is no]{.mark} significant [relationship
between]{.mark} the **rate of [economic growth and]{.mark} the
[magnitude of emissions reductions]{.mark}** within the
group.]{.underline} While it is unlikely that there is not at least some
linkage between the two factors, there are plenty of examples of
countries (e.g., Singapore, Romania, and Ireland) experiencing both
extremely rapid economic growth and large reductions in CO2 emissions.

1\. Introduction Global surface temperatures have risen by 1.1 degrees
above their 1850--1900 levels, a stark reminder of climate change
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2023). Despite the
scientific consensus on the need to limit global warming to 1.5--2
degrees by the end of the century, global efforts to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions are lagging. Climate change is just one of nine planetary
boundaries impacted by human activities, with six already exceeding
their safe limits (Richardson et al., 2023). These challenges fall
within the broader scope of social dilemmas concerning the management of
common pool resources. Social scientists, dating back to Lloyd (1833),
have recognized the tension between individual incentives and the
sustainable use of shared resources. Today, this tension is exemplified
by climate change, which "menaces our planet and looms over our future
like a Colossus" (Nordhaus, 2019). Historically, institutions have
played a pivotal role in aligning individual actions with the collective
good. Examples include the successful avoidance of a nuclear holocaust
during the Cold War through diplomatic and arms control institutions,
and the reversal of ozone layer depletion via the crafting and
implementation of the Montreal Protocol. As the world now grapples with
the multifaceted challenge of sustainable development, the role of
institutions in effectively decoupling economic growth from
environmental impacts becomes increasingly crucial. However, significant
variations exist in the structure of economic and political institutions
across countries, influencing their capacity to deepen and sustain this
decoupling. This paper employs the Varieties of Capitalism (VOC)
framework to hypothesize which institutional structures might best
support decoupling economic growth from environmental impacts. It posits
that a robust Welfare State, particularly through generous universal
social expenditures that do not depend on work status, can facilitate
stronger decoupling by nurturing broad support for costly environmental
policies. An econometric model was applied to OECD economies, utilizing
the Ecological Footprint of Consumption as a measure of environmental
impact. The results indicate that Northern European countries have been
more effective in decoupling their economic growth from environmental
impacts compared to other OECD countries. Further analysis reveals that
universal social expenditures are robustly associated with lower
environmental impacts at a given level of economic growth, suggesting
that the robust and universal Welfare States of Northern European
countries have supported their superior performance. 2. Conceptual
framework and hypotheses 2.1. Capitalism, growth, and environmental
degradation Can capitalism turn around its history of environmental
degradation? As economic growth drives anthropogenic impacts on the
environment (Dietz et al., 2007), the answer to this question depends on
whether economic growth can be decoupled from environmental impacts or,
alternatively, if a capitalist economy could be conceived without
economic growth. Building on the seminal contributions of Meadows et al.
(1972) and Daly and Cobb (1989), ecological economists have pioneered
the theoretical envisioning of capitalism within planetary boundaries.
This research agenda has contributed to the limits-to-growth debate at
various levels. Firstly, it has pushed the interdependency between the
economy and the environment into mainstream economics, where Integrated
Assessment Models (IAMs) are now widely recognized as a sound conceptual
framework to evaluate climate policy (Nordhaus, 2019). Secondly, it has
developed IAMs to identify the challenges that a market economy would
face if converging towards zero growth and suggested alternative
policies to address them (Lawn, 2011, Malmaeus et al., 2017, Victor,
2012). Thirdly, scholars have theorized on the sources of the "growth
imperative", i.e., the economic and social forces that make capitalist
societies dependent on economic growth to thrive (Gordon and Rosenthal,
2003, Johnson, 2015, Strunz et al., 2015). Some scholars have been
critical of this research agenda, arguing that capitalism cannot be
stripped of its growth imperative (Smith, 2010). In their view, economic
growth and environmental degradation are intrinsic to capitalism,
rendering efforts to green capitalism hypocritical. This position
overlooks the rich varieties of forms that capitalism has taken,
testifying to its potential for positive change. At the other extreme,
some trust in what they deem to be capitalism's inherent traits, such as
technological innovation, to put a check on environmental degradation
without hindering economic growth. This position is illustrated by the
Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, which posits that countries
reduce environmental degradation after reaching a wealth threshold
(Grossman and Krueger, 1995). However, evidence for this hypothesis is
mixed, especially when considering resource consumption and CO emissions
(Dinda, 2004, Stern, 2004, Stern, 2017). Both sides of the debate hold
an essentialist conception of capitalism, as an abstract phenomenon
experienced in different degrees of purity. This paper embraces a
non-essentialist conception of capitalism, anchored in the variety of
forms capitalism has taken across time and space. Instead of examining
whether capitalism can turn around its history of environmental
degradation, the paper delves into what forms of capitalism, as
identified by the Varieties of Capitalism literature, are better
positioned to deepen the decoupling of economic growth from
environmental degradation. While the question of whether the least
destructive forms of capitalism are sustainable in the long term will
remain unanswered, the hope is that identifying the institutional
configurations that sustain the most sustainable forms of capitalism
will contribute to the ongoing struggle of forging a sustainable future.
2.2. Corporatism and environmental performance

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

The VOC literature has emphasized certain institutions that consistently
vary among advanced capitalist economies and may play a significant role
in their relative environmental performance. One such distinction lies
in the [degree of **[corporatism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, representing
the [extent to which **economic activity**]{.underline} and national
politics are [mediated by]{.underline} interest [groups capable of
coordinating actions]{.underline} within an institutional space that
serves as an alternative to the market (Soskice and Hall, 2001). Scruggs
(1999) suggests that [corporatism]{.underline} can [**[enhance]{.mark}**
the implementation of **[environmental policies]{.mark}** by providing
an **institutional framework** for negotiating their execution with
affected stakeholders]{.underline}. [This involvement of firms and trade
unions]{.underline} in policy design from the outset can increase [their
willingness to **comply**]{.underline}. However, Scruggs also highlights
challenges, such as the possibility that more corporatist economies may
harbor stronger and better-organized interests favoring economic growth,
potentially undermining environmental performance.

Additionally, the [developed world]{.underline} has [widely adopted a
range of [**market-based instruments** for **environmental
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where [the **advantage** of
corporatist institutions is **not evident**]{.underline} (Jordan et al.,
2003). As a result, the effectiveness of corporatism in improving
environmental performance remains an open question. Scruggs, 1999,
Scruggs, 2001 found that [economies with **[higher]{.mark} degrees of
[corporatism]{.mark}** [demonstrated **better environmental
outcomes**]{.mark} across various indicators]{.underline} between 1970
and 1990. In contrast, Jahn (2016b) documents a negative association
between corporatism and environmental performance up to the 1980s, which
then becomes positive in subsequent years.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

2.3. Welfare state and environmental performance Beyond corporatism, the
VOC literature also emphasizes the crucial role of social policies in
mitigating market risks as a dimension that distinguishes countries.
Building upon Esping-Andersen (1990)'s seminal work, Estevez-Abe et al.
(2001) study how social policy characteristics in various countries
contribute to the development of unique skill sets. They suggest that a
generous Welfare State facilitates investment in specialized skills by
assisting workers through challenging periods and ensuring they find
employment where their skills are valued. This robust Welfare State,
acting in conjunction with corporatism, endows countries with a
competitive advantage in sectors requiring specialized skills and
ongoing innovation. Thus, the combination of corporatism and social
policy support shapes two primary VOC archetypes: Liberal Market
Economies (LME), defined by market-driven coordination and limited
welfare support, and Coordinated Market Economies (CME), characterized
by a corporatist structure complemented by extensive welfare benefits.
The Welfare State can play a crucial role in determining environmental
performance, primarily for two reasons. First, by mitigating
inequalities, it can reduce the political pressure for economic growth.
This occurs not only because these policies serve as an alternative to
economic growth by providing income security, but also because high
levels of inequality can drive increased consumption in societies where
relative status is important (Alpizar et al., 2005, Bursztyn et al.,
2017). Second, robust welfare systems often adopt a more
institutionalized approach to support and reintegrate individuals who
may be adversely affected by policies aimed at redirecting the economy
towards sustainability (Martin and Thelen, 2007). 2.4. The evolution of
welfare states since the 1980s Since the 1980s, welfare systems across
the developed world have been strained by the structural shift towards a
service economy. Iversen and Wren (1998) proposes that countries faced a
policy trilemma, compelled to prioritize only two out of three policy
goals under these circumstances: employment growth, budgetary restraint,
and income equality.1 Northern European countries prioritized income
equality and employment by expanding public employment. In contrast,
Continental European countries favored income equality and budgetary
restraint by limiting labor market participation, while LMEs prioritized
employment growth and budgetary restraint. A substantial portion of
public employment growth in Northern European countries has been
directed toward services provided by the welfare system, potentially
nurturing post-materialist values associated with higher support for
costly environmental policies (Gingrich and Häusermann, 2015, Inglehart,
1995). Thelen (2014) adds to Iversen and Wren (1998)'s policy trilemma
by conceptualizing distinctive paths of liberalization that countries
have adopted to reform their welfare systems under increasing fiscal
strain. LMEs have followed a path of deregulation, which entailed
dismantling the coordinating capacity of corporatist institutions and a
substantial decline in the proportion of the economy covered by such
institutions. CMEs in Continental Europe have pursued a dualization
path, maintaining the strength of corporatist institutions while
experiencing a decrease in the proportion of workers covered by
collective arrangements. Lastly, CMEs in Northern Europe have adopted a
path of embedded flexibilization, incorporating more market-based
coordination into the economy while overhauling the Welfare State to
collectivize the risks associated with increased flexibility. The
different liberalization paths followed by Continental and Northern
European CMEs are associated with differences in the evolution of budget
priorities for welfare benefits among them, with Northern European CMEs
prioritizing universal benefits, such as education and health, and
Continental European CMEs focusing on work-related benefits, like
unemployment and survival insurance (Scruggs and Ramalho Tafoya, 2022,
Sowula et al., 2023). While work-related benefits can directly
compensate those who stand to lose from more stringent environmental
regulations, the share of the population covered by these benefits has
shrunk in CMEs under increasingly dualized labor markets (Emmenegger et
al., 2012). Hence, relying on work-related social benefits risks
alienating an ever-growing segment of the population (Schwander, 2019).
In contrast, while universal benefits are not targeted towards
compensating and reactivating workers, they provide a safety net that
serves workers who might otherwise feel threatened by environmental
regulations, plausibly nurturing wider support for costly environmental
policies. 2.5. Hypotheses The conceptual framework developed here
supports the main hypothesis of this study: a robust Welfare State is
associated with enhanced environmental performance. This connection is
attributed to the Welfare State's capacity to cultivate broader support
for environmental policies by influencing income inequality,
compensating and reactivating individuals facing potential losses from
more stringent environmental regulation, and fostering a public
workforce inclined toward post-materialist values. Furthermore, given
increasing labor market dualization, the effectiveness of the Welfare
State in promoting environmental policies is anticipated to be more
pronounced when universal benefits encompass a larger share of social
expenditures. Finally, given that the previous literature has found
mixed results on the environmental impacts of corporatism and has
developed theoretical arguments supporting both positive and negative
effects, the paper formulates no specific hypothesis on the impact of
this variable on environmental performance.

3\. Sample and data

3.1. Sample

The [paper]{.underline} focuses on a sample of countries and years where
environmental performance is expected to have played a relevant role in
domestic politics. Specifically, it [targets **advanced capitalist
economies**]{.underline} due to their large environmental footprint. The
time period considered is from 1961 to 2015, a critical era that
includes the rise of the global environmental movement in the 60s and
70s and aligning with the growing consensus in the scientific community
about anthropogenic factors being primary drivers of climate change.
Since most of the OECD data used in this study is available from the
1980s onwards, the sample [includes]{.underline} **[Western OECD
countries]{.underline}** that were members in 1980 and had populations
exceeding one million. The countries in this sample are Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

3.2. Data

This paper [employs]{.underline} the Ecological Footprint of Consumption
(**[EFC]{.underline}**) as a metric for environmental performance.
[Conceived by]{.underline} Mathis [Wackernagel and]{.underline} William
[Rees]{.underline} at the University of British Columbia, the EFC is
currently developed by the Global Footprint Network. [The
index]{.underline}, available annually from 1961 to 2018, [represents an
attempt to **condense** environmental impacts from **six different
realms**]{.underline} (agriculture, cattle raising, timber production,
fishing, carbon intake, and built-up land) [into **one
unit**]{.underline}. It is defined, for any given population, as "the
total area of productive ecosystems that the population requires, on a
continuous basis, to produce the bio-resources it consumes (e.g.,
plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber
and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure) and to
assimilate its wastes, particularly carbon dioxide emissions, wherever
on Earth the relevant ecosystems are located" (Rees and Wackernagel,
2023). For worldwide comparability, the index [utilizes]{.underline} the
[amount of hectares of]{.underline} global average
[productivity]{.underline} required in the production process of various
goods and services.2

The [EFC has been developed for over **thirty years**]{.underline}, with
subsequent versions addressing the observations that have emerged from
an active ongoing debate around the strengths and shortcomings of the
index (Rees and Wackernagel, 2023). In addition to its wide adoption in
applied environmental research, the EFC has been selected for the
analyses of this paper because of two specific advantages. Firstly, the
EFC utilizes trade data to calculate the environmental footprint for
production, imports, and exports. Thus, the [**environmental impact** of
**consumption** for each country can be **derived** from the
identity]{.underline} .3 This approach addresses a limitation of studies
that focus solely on environmental impacts within a specific
geographical boundary, which overlook the outsourcing of pollutant
processes (Özler and Obach, 2009). Secondly, [data]{.underline} on the
components that make up the index across the different realms allow to
check the robustness of the results to considering standard
environmental realms that [have a more **straightforward**
interpretation]{.underline}, [such as emissions of greenhouse
gases]{.underline}.

For the economic variables, this paper utilizes absorption (consumption
plus investment) at chained purchasing power parity 2017 dollars from
the World Penn Tables (Feenstra et al., 2015). The public social
expenditure and its components as a fraction of GDP are sourced from
OECD open stats, available from 1980 to 2022 (OECD, 2016). The nine
components that make up total public social expenditure are defined as
follows (OECD, 2019): (i) Old Age: Cash expenditures on pensions,
comprising guaranteed income once a person has reached a pensionable age
and fulfilled a level of contributions. This also includes other in-kind
services to the elderly; (ii) Survivors: Benefits provided to the spouse
or descendant of a deceased person, including the transfer of pension
benefits or other means-tested benefits; (iii) Incapacity-related
benefits: Cash benefits for those who cannot participate in the labor
market due to congenital disabilities or illness; (iv) Health:
Government expenditure in health, including social health insurance
scheme; (v) Family: Benefits that support families, often related to the
cost of raising children or supporting other dependents; (vi) Active
labor market programmes: Social expenditures other than education aimed
at improving beneficiaries' chances of finding gainful employment or
increasing earnings; (vii) Unemployment: Cash expenditure aimed at
compensating people dismissed through no fault of their own or older
workers who retire early; (viii) Housing: Rent subsidies and other
benefits that help cover housing costs; (ix) Other Social Policy Areas:
Social expenditures for people that fall outside the scope of other
relevant programmes that cover particular contingencies. The nine
components of public social expenditures are divided into two groups
based on whether most of the benefits are contingent on formal
employment (either current or past). The work-related benefits group
comprises Old Age, Survivor, and Unemployment, whereas the universal
benefits group comprises the remaining components. This classification
is supported by the brief definitions provided above and the detailed
descriptions and examples available in OECD (2019). Among the nine
components, Old Age proves the most challenging to classify as either
universal or work-related, as most countries combine contribution-based
pensions with benefits that are not contingent on past working status or
earnings. Nevertheless, the level of benefits is still closely tied to
contributions: given the current design of pension systems in OECD
countries, workers with average earnings and a full contribution history
are expected to receive half of their earnings while working. On the
other hand, people without a contribution record receive, on average,
only 21% of the average wage, and only after passing a means test in
most countries (OECD, 2023). For this reason, the paper classifies Old
Age as a work-related benefit but tests the robustness of the results by
omitting this category from the definition of work-related benefits in
the Appendix. Detlef Jahn's Corporatism Index serves as a time-variant
measure of corporatism. The index, developed for 42 countries by Jahn
(2016a), is publicly available from 1960 to 2018 (Jahn, 2022). The index
is based on the evaluation of the structure, function, and scope of
trade unions. In terms of structure, the author quantifies the level of
centralization, the relationships between different layers of labor
organizations, and the legal rights associated with each layer.
Regarding function, the evaluation focuses on the interaction between
trade unions and the State, quantifying the extent to which trade unions
participate in national politics and the degree of national government
intervention in industrial relations. Lastly, scope quantifies the
societal impact of trade unions' negotiation outcomes. The index offers
the advantage of capturing corporativism beyond wage bargaining
institutions, including the involvement of unions and trade associations
in shaping public policy, including environmental regulations.4 Data on
characteristics of the political systems of countries is derived from
The Comparative Political Data Set (CPDS). This dataset, an outcome of a
project led by Klaus Armigeon and supported by the Swiss National
Science Foundation (Armingeon et al., 2017), offers yearly data spanning
from 1960 onward. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of variables
characterizing the political systems of advanced capitalist economies.
This study utilizes information on the classification of electoral
systems (majoritarian, modified proportional, and proportional) and the
degree of federalism (absent, weak, and strong). 4. Empirical analysis
4.1. Econometric model The relationship between economic growth,
institutions, and environmental impacts is modeled through the
non-linear relation \[\[EQUATION ONE OMITTED\]\] where and are the
country-level aggregated Environmental Footprint of Consumption and
absorption (consumption plus investment) for country in period ; is a
vector of variables describing country 's institutions on period ; , , ,
and , are vectors of coefficients of dimensions 1, 1, 1, and ; and ɛ is
a zero-mean disturbance. The equation is linearized applying the natural
logarithm to obtain \[\[EQUATION TWO OMITTED\]\] which is estimated with
the Ordinarily Least Square estimator, with country and period fixed
effects ( and ). The data is aggregated in 5 years periods to average
out short-term fluctuations and focus on the long-term evolution of
environmental impacts across countries. This econometric specification
offers various advantage. First, the coefficients and are part of a
linear combination that equals the absorption elasticity of (henceforth
denoted by ), defined as the percentage change in when absorption
increases in 1%. This follows from differentiating Eq. (1) with respect
to and rearranging to obtain \[\[EQUATION THREE OMITTED\]\] Hence,
equals the value of when , and the marginal effect of the variable of ,
, on . A negative indicates that higher values of are associated to a
smaller absorption elasticity of , i.e., a stronger decoupling between
economic growth and environmental impacts. Second, the coefficients also
have a convenient interpretation, capturing the log-point difference
between period and the baseline period after taking into account the
effect of absorption growth. Follows that equals the percentage change
in the EFC relative to the baseline period. Third, the specification
allows for the inclusion of country and period fixed effects,
controlling for unobserved confounders that are constant across time
within a country, such as geography or climate, or across countries
within a given time period, such as technology or the international
interest rate. Note, however, that such characteristics could still bias
the results if they modify , a possibility that is addressed by
incorporating country dummies in . Finally, the specification is
consistent with the intuitive notion that there are no environmental
impacts from consumption if there is no absorption (the intercept of Eq.
(1) is zero). The focus on decoupling overlooks the possibility that
countries might choose to reduce their growth to lessen their
environmental impacts. This approach is justified on the grounds that a
decrease in the environmental impacts of growth signifies an unambiguous
policy gain. In contrast, considering that economic growth often remains
a top priority for policymakers and the general public, a decline in
environmental impacts due to slowed growth might more likely indicate a
country's failure to meet its growth expectations rather than a
concerted pursuit of environmental goals. Consequently, a stronger
decoupling is seen as reflective of deliberate efforts to improve
environmental outcomes, whereas reductions in environmental impacts
resulting from lower growth rates may also capture the unintended
consequence of failing to grow as intended.5 4.2. Divergent
environmental trajectories of VOC archetypes It follows from the
Conceptual Framework developed in Section 2 that, on top of the
canonical distinction between Liberal Markets Economies and Coordinated
Market Economies proposed by Soskice and Hall (2001), it is convenient
to split the latter group into Continental European Countries and
Northern European Countries, as their Welfare States have undergone
different processes of liberalization (Thelen, 2014). In addition,
Southern European Countries are added as a fourth group given their
lower level of economic development in the 1960s. Thus, four groups of
countries are proposed as archetypes for this study: Norther European
Countries (NOR: Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland), Continental
European Countries (CON: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands,
France, and Belgium), Liberal Market Economies (LME: USA, Canada, Great
Britain, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand), and Southern European
Countries (STH: Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece). To summarize the
relative performance of the four groups of countries across the study
period (1961--2015), is set equal to three dummies encoding these groups
in Eq. (2), setting Continental European Countries as the omitted
category. Panel a of Fig. 1 present the results. Whereas a 1% in
absorption is associated to an increase of 0.42% in EFC for Continental
European Countries, the same percentage increase in absorption is
associated with a 0.07% increase in the EFC for Northern European
Countries. The difference is significant at the 1% level. The same
figures are 0.61% and 0.32% for Southern European Countries and Liberal
Market Economies; which are not statistically different from the level
of Continental European Countries. Thus, Northern European Countries
have decoupled environmental impacts from economic growth to a
considerably larger extent than other countries. To investigate the
timing of this divergence, is removed from Eq. (2) and a separate set of
period dummies is estimated for each VOC archetype ( for {CME, LME, NOR,
STH}), setting 1961--1965 as the omitted period. Panel b of Fig. 1
display the trajectory of environmental impacts of VOC archetypes
relative to the trajectory of Continental European Countries. The lines
in the figure, accompanied by 95% confidence intervals in
semi-transparent colors corresponding to each archetype, represent the
average percentage change in the EFC from the baseline period to the
specific period on the -axis, relative to Continental European
Countries, while controlling for absorption growth. A clear pattern
emerges from the analysis. After the 1970s, a period when environmental
degradation became a prominent issue in public debate, Northern European
countries consistently outperformed the rest of the sample. By the final
period of the study (2011--2015), their environmental footprint,
adjusted for absorption growth, had increased 30% less than that of
Continental European Countries. Interestingly, there are no large
differences between Liberal Market Economies and Continental European
Countries, suggesting that the institutions that distinguish Northern
European Economies from other CMEs are crucial to sustain their superior
environmental performance. Southern European Countries underperformed
until the early 2000s, peaking at 30% additional growth in
absorption-adjusted environmental impact compared to Continental
European Countries. However, they have since rapidly converged toward
the rest of the sample. This pattern aligns with the lower income levels
in Southern European Countries during the 1960s and their subsequent
economic convergence. It is plausible that environmental concerns became
prominent in domestic politics only after these countries reached a
critical income level by the end of the 20th century, in line with the
Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) Hypothesis (Grossman and Krueger,
1995).6 \[\[FIGURE ONE OMITTED\]\] Fig. 1. Divergent environmental
trajectories of VOC's archetypes---Panel a shows estimates of the
absorption elasticity of the EFC for Continental European Countries
(CON), Northern European Countries (NOR), Liberal Market Economies
(LME), and Southern European Countries (STH). Panel b shows the
different trajectories in the percentage growth of the EFC from its
1961--1965 level for LME, NOR, and STH relative to the trajectory of
CON, after taking into account the effect of absorption growth. 4.3. The
institutions that make a difference for the environment Section 2
hypothesizes that the level of generosity of the welfare state,
particularly in terms of universal benefits, underpins the differences
in environmental performance among VOC archetypes documented in Fig. 1.
To test this hypothesis, social expenditures are divided in two
categories: work-related social expenditures, encompassing Old Age,
Survivor, and Unemployment; and universal social expenditures,
encompassing Incapacity-related benefits, Health, Family, Active labor
market programmes, Unemployment, Housing, and Other Social Policy Areas.
In addition to social expenditures, previous studies have highlighted
that corporatism can play a pivotal role in explaining countries'
relative environmental performance. Hence, the analysis also includes
this variable. The analysis proceeds in two steps. First, a clustering
algorithm is employed to test whether the specified variables
effectively characterize the VOC archetypes. Subsequently, the model
outlined in Eq. (2) is utilized to examine which differences across the
institutional dimensions, as captured by these variables, explain the
divergent trajectories of environmental performance among VOC
archetypes. 4.3.1. Characterizing VOC archetypes through differences in
corporatism and social expenditures A clustering algorithm is used to
test if the four VOC archetypes considered in this study (CON, LME, NOR,
STH) can be distinguished based on three variables representing key
institutional differences: corporatism, universal social expenditures,
and work-related social expenditures. These variables are averaged for
each country in the sample where data are available (1981--2015) and
standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one
across the 20 countries. The standardized variables are then input into
a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) aimed at identifying four distinct
clusters. The GMM, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, calculates the
probability of each country belonging to each cluster (with the number
of clusters being a predetermined hyperparameter).7 Importantly, the
algorithm does not use any information about the countries' VOC
archetypes; it solely relies on the institutional variables. A strong
correlation between the VOC archetypes and the algorithm-defined
clusters would suggest that the institutional differences represented by
these variables are meaningful in differentiating the VOC archetypes.
Table 1 presents the results. The first two columns categorize the
countries according to their VOC archetypes, with the average for each
archetype displayed following the individual country values. The
subsequent three columns report the average values of the three
variables of interest: corporatism, universal social expenditures, and
work-related social expenditures. The final four columns display the
probabilities estimated by the GMM, shaded from white (0%) to blue
(100%). The correspondence between the VOC archetypes and the GMM groups
is strikingly strong. For Continental European Countries, the GMM places
all countries, except Switzerland and the Netherlands, in Group 1. All
Liberal Market Economies are grouped in Group 2. Northern European
Countries, except for Finland which is split between Groups 1 and 3, are
in Group 3 together with the Netherlands. Southern European Countries,
along with Switzerland, are grouped together in Group 4. The rows
displaying the averages of the institutional variables give a clear
indication of why the algorithm effectively clustered countries in line
with their VOC archetypes. Liberal Market Economies are characterized by
their low corporatism (−0.8) and work-related social expenditures (6.1).
In contrast, Northern European Countries stand out with high values of
corporatism (0.7) and universal social expenditures (15.4). Southern
European Countries are characterized by their low levels of universal
social expenditures (8.7) but high levels of work-related social
expenditures (11.1). Continental European Countries are identifiable by
their medium to high values in corporatism and universal social
expenditure (0.5 and 12.3, respectively) and high work-related social
expenditure (11.1). The countries that were misclassified are outliers
within their groups: Switzerland shows the lowest values for social
expenditures among Continental European Countries, the Netherlands is
distinguished by high values of corporatism and universal social
expenditures but low work-related social expenditure, and Finland aligns
with Continental European Countries in terms of work-related social
expenditures. Overall, the accurate classification of 17 out of 20
countries using only three variables underscores the significance of
these institutional variables in characterizing VOC archetypes. Table 1.
VOC archetypes---The table shows the average values of corporatism,
universal social expenditures, and work-related social expenditures for
each country in the sample, along with the probabilities predicted by a
Gaussian Mixture Model for classification into four groups, based on
these variables. VOC archetype anachronisms are: CON for Continental
European Countries, LME for Liberal Market Economies, NOR for Northern
European Countries, and STH for Southern European Countries. Countries
anachronisms are USA for United States, CAN for Canada, GBR for United
Kingdom, IRL for Ireland, AUS for Australia, AUT for Austria, NZL for
New Zealand, AUT for Austria, BEL for Belgium, CHE for Switzerland, DEU

for Finland, NOR for Norway, SWE for Sweden, ESP for Spain, GRC for
Greece, PRT for Portugal, and ITA for Italy. \[\[TABLE ONE OMITTED\]\]
4.3.2. VOC institutions and environmental performance This section
estimates Eq. (2) by including different sets of institutional variables
in to investigate which institutional differences are associated with
better environmental performance. The analysis focuses on the
institutional variables highlighted by the conceptual framework and the
empirical analysis in the previous section as distinguishing between VOC
archetypes: corporatism and social expenditures, with a distinction
between universal and work-related expenditures. Additional
institutional variables identified by previous studies as relevant
determinants of environmental performance are also included as controls,
as they may correlate with the variables of interest. These controls
include the electoral system, the degree of federalism, and baseline per
capita GDP. The sample is composed of 7 five-year periods where data are
available, from 1981--1985 to 2011--2015. Table 2 presents the results.
Column 1 includes the Corporatism index and total social expenditures as
a fraction of GDP. No impacts are detected for these variables on the
absorption elasticity of EFC, which is estimated at 0.358 in the first
row. Column 2 splits total social expenditures into universal social
expenditures and work-related social expenditures (four observations are
lost due to missing information). The null result of social expenditure
in column 1 masked an interesting heterogeneity. The results indicate
that each additional percentage point of GDP spent on universal social
expenditures is associated with a reduction of 0.21 percentage points in
the absorption elasticity of EFC, significant at the 1% level.
Conversely, each additional percentage point of GDP spent on
work-related social expenditure is associated with a 0.13
percentage-point increase in the absorption elasticity of EFC,
significant at the 5% level. Column 3 adds the natural logarithm of per
capita GDP in 1981 to to account for the EKC hypothesis, along with
dummies representing the electoral system and federalism of countries.8
Scruggs (1999) argues for the relevance of the electoral system and
federalism as institutional determinants of environmental performance.
Majoritarian electoral systems are expected to be slower in
incorporating emerging issues into the policy agenda because it is
harder for new parties to win seats in parliament. Federal governments
may encounter difficulties in implementing environmental policies at the
local level, though local autonomy can act as a safeguard for
environmental policies when federal policies are less favorable to
environmental goals. The inclusion of these variables barely affects the
point estimate of universal social expenditures, which remains
significant at the 1% level, while rendering the point estimate
associated to work-related social expenditures not significant at
conventional levels. Additionally, the results suggest that federal
countries are associated with worse environmental performance (with
unitary states as the omitted category), while no significant difference
is detected between proportional and majoritarian electoral systems (the
latter being the omitted category). The point estimate for baseline per
capita GDP aligns with the ascending part of the EKC hypothesis,
indicating that marginal environmental impacts decrease as a country's
wealth increases, although it is not statistically significant. Column 4
includes the same controls as column 3, but additionally excludes
Southern European Countries from the sample due to their lower level of
economic development at the baseline. The estimate for universal social
expenditures remains largely unchanged and continues to be significant
at the 1% level. Meanwhile, the estimate for work-related social
expenditures flips sign and remains not statistically significant at
conventional levels. Table 2. Institutions and environmental

Columns 5 and 6 replicate the estimates from columns 1 and 2, but with
the addition of an interaction between countries' fixed effects and .
Consequently, these estimators are derived exclusively from
within-country variation, making them robust to unobserved
time-invariant country characteristics that might affect their
absorption elasticity of EFC. Column 5 reveals that this specification
detects an impact for total social expenditures: a 1 GDP point increase
in total social expenditure is associated with a reduction of 0.13
percentage points in the absorption elasticity of EFC. The coefficient
for corporatism, while larger in absolute value compared to that in
column 1, remains statistically indistinguishable from zero at
conventional levels. Column 6 indicates that when total social
expenditures are divided into universal and work-related components,
only the former yields a statistically significant point estimate at
conventional levels ( %). Reassuringly, this point estimate closely
aligns with those obtained in columns 2--4. Overall, the consistency of
the estimated impact of universal social expenditures on the absorption
elasticity of EFC, as shown in Table 2, is remarkable. The pattern is
also observed when using the CO emissions component of the Environmental
Footprint of Production as the dependent variable in the analysis,
showing the result is robust to how environmental impacts are measured
(Table B.3); or when removing Old Age from work-related benefits (Table
B.4), showing the result is robust to the classification of Old Age
social expenditures. This consistency provides strong support for the
hypothesis that universal social expenditures are a significant
determinant of a country's ability to decouple economic growth from
environmental impacts. In contrast, the results do not lend support to
the hypothesis that corporatism plays a significant role in determining
a country's environmental performance. These results align with the
results presented in Fig. 1. Universal social expenditures distinguish
Northern European countries from Continental European countries,
plausibly playing an important role in supporting their superior
environmental performance. In contrast, the higher level of corporatism
in Continental European Countries does not result in better
environmental performance when compared to Liberal Market Economies,
which are characterized by low levels of corporatism.

5\. **[Conclusion]{.underline}**

This [paper investigates]{.underline} the analytical and empirical
[leverage of]{.underline} the Varieties of
**[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** framework in explaining
environmental performance across countries. It [posits]{.underline} that
three key [characteristics]{.underline}, identified as central in
differentiating various forms of capitalism, impact environmental
performance: the level of corporatism, the generosity of the Welfare
State, and the nature of that generosity---whether it is universal or
concentrated in work-related benefits susceptible to dualization. The
[empirical results suggest]{.underline} that social
[expenditures]{.underline}, particularly those that are universal, [play
a **[crucial]{.mark} role** [in environmental
performance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, [**[corporatism]{.mark}**
does **[not]{.mark} consistently [account]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} the differences in [how countries have
**[decoupled]{.mark}**]{.underline} [economic [growth]{.mark} from
environmental impacts]{.underline}. Consistently, [**Northern European**
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, characterized by high levels of
universal social expenditures, [have [**decouple** environmental
impacts]{.mark}]{.underline} from economic growth to a [**[considerably
greater extent]{.mark}** than their OECD peers]{.underline}.

#### [Absolute]{.underline} decoupling happens [now]{.underline}.

Over the past 15 years, however, something has begun to change. Rather
than a 21st century dominated by coal that energy modelers foresaw,
[global **coal use peaked**]{.underline} in 2013 [and is now in
**structural decline**]{.underline}. We have [succeeded in making
**clean energy cheap**]{.underline}, with [solar power and battery
storage costs falling **10-fold**]{.underline} since 2009. The [world
produced **more electricity** from **clean energy**]{.underline} ---
[solar]{.underline}, [wind]{.underline}, [hydro]{.underline}, [and
nuclear]{.underline} --- [than from coal over the past **two
years**]{.underline}. And, according to some major oil companies,
[**peak oil** is upon us]{.underline} --- not because we have run out of
cheap oil to produce, but because [demand is **falling**]{.underline}
and [companies expect **further decline** as consumers increasingly
shift to **electric vehicles**]{.underline}.

The [world]{.underline} has long been [experiencing a]{.underline}
relative [**decoupling** between economic growth and CO2
emissions]{.underline}, with the [emissions per]{.underline} unit of
[GDP **falling** for the past **60 years**]{.underline}. This is the
[case]{.underline} even [in countries like **India** and **China**
that]{.underline} have been [undergoing **rapid economic
growth**]{.underline}. But relative decoupling alone is inadequate in a
world where global CO2 emissions need to peak and decline in the next
decade to give us any chance at limiting warming to well below 2℃, in
line with Paris Agreement targets.

Thankfully, there is [increasing evidence]{.underline} that the [world
is **on track** to **absolutely decouple** CO2 emissions and economic
growth]{.underline} --- with global CO2 [emissions]{.underline}
potentially [having **peaked in 2019** and **unlikely to increase**
substantially in the coming decade]{.underline}. While an emissions peak
is just the first and easiest step towards eventually reaching the
net-zero emissions required to stop the world from continuing to warm,
it demonstrates that linkages between emissions and economic activity
are not an immutable law, but rather simply a result of our current
means of energy production.

In recent years we have seen [**more** and **more examples** of absolute
decoupling]{.underline} --- economic growth accompanied by [falling CO2
emissions]{.underline}. Since 2005, [32 countries]{.underline} with a
population of at least one million people have **[absolutely
decoupled]{.underline}** emissions [from economic growth]{.underline},
both [for **terrestrial** emissions]{.underline} (those within national
borders) [and **consumption** emissions]{.underline} (emissions embodied
in the goods consumed in a country). This includes the United States,
Japan, Mexico, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Poland, Romania,
Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden, Hungary, Belarus, Austria,
Bulgaria, El Salvador, Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Norway,
Ireland, New Zealand, Croatia, Jamaica, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia,
Estonia, and Cyprus. Figure 1, below, shows the [**declines** in
territorial emissions]{.underline} (blue) and increases in GDP (red).

To qualify as having experienced absolute decoupling, we require
countries included in this analysis to pass four separate filters: a
population of at least one million (to focus the analysis on more
representative cases), declining territorial emissions over the
2005-2019 period (based on a linear regression), declining consumption
emissions, and increasing real GDP (on a purchasing power parity basis,
using constant 2017 international \$USD). We chose not to include 2020
in this analysis because it is not particularly representative of
longer-term trends, and consumption and territorial emissions estimates
are not yet available for many countries.

There is a [wide range of rates of economic growth]{.underline} between
2005-2019 among countries [experiencing **absolute
decoupling**]{.underline}. Somewhat counterintuitively, there is no
significant relationship between the rate of economic growth and the
magnitude of emissions reductions within the group. While it is unlikely
that there is not at least some linkage between the two factors, there
are plenty of examples of countries (e.g., Singapore, Romania, and
Ireland) experiencing both extremely rapid economic growth and large
reductions in CO2 emissions.

One of the primary criticisms of some prior analyses of absolute
decoupling is that they ignore leakage. Specifically, the
[**offshoring** of manufacturing]{.underline} from high-income countries
over the past three decades [to countries like China has led to
"illusory" drops in emissions]{.underline}, [where the emissions
associated with high-income country consumption are simply **shipped
overseas**]{.underline} and no longer show up in territorial emissions
accounting. There is some truth in this critique, as there was a large
increase in emissions embodied in imports from developing countries
between 1990 and 2005. After 2005, **[however]{.underline}**,
[**structural changes** in China and a **growing domestic market** led
to a **reversal** of these trends]{.underline}; the [amount of emissions
"**exported**"]{.underline} from developed countries to developing
countries [has actually **declined** over the past **15
years**]{.underline}.

This means that, for many countries, both [territorial emissions and
consumption emissions]{.underline} (which include any emissions
"exported" to other countries) [have **jointly declined**]{.underline}.
In fact, on average, [consumption]{.underline} [emissions]{.underline}
have been [**declining** slightly faster than territorial
emissions]{.underline} since 2005 in the 32 countries we identify as
experiencing absolute decoupling. Figure 2, below, shows the change in
consumption emissions (teal) and GDP (red) between 2005 and 2019.

There is a pretty wide variation in the extent to which these countries
have reduced their territorial and consumption emissions since 2005.
Some countries --- such as the UK, Denmark, Finland, and Singapore --
have seen territorial emissions fall faster than consumption emissions,
while the US, Japan, Germany, and Spain (among others) have seen
consumption emissions fall faster. Figure 3 shows reductions in
consumption and territorial emissions for each country, with the size of
the dot representing the size of the population in 2019.

**[Absolute decoupling is possible]{.underline}**. [There is no
**physical** law requiring **economic growth**]{.underline} --- [and
broader increases in human wellbeing]{.underline} --- [to necessarily be
linked to **CO2** emissions]{.underline}. [All]{.underline} of the
[services]{.underline} that we [rely on today that emit fossil
fuels]{.underline} --- electricity, transportation, heating, food ---
[can]{.underline} in principle [be replaced by **near-zero carbon**
alternatives]{.underline}, though these are [more mature]{.underline} in
some sectors (electricity, transportation, buildings) than in others
(industrial processes, agriculture).

This is not to say that infinite economic growth is desirable (or even
possible), particularly given that the global population is expected to
start to shrink by the end of the 21st century (and well before that in
most currently wealthy countries). There will be some tradeoffs between
economic growth and climate mitigation --- particularly if the world is
to meet ambitious mitigation targets. But it is [possible to
envision]{.underline} a world that is [prosperous]{.underline},
[equal]{.underline}, [and at net-zero emissions]{.underline}; indeed,
all of the future emissions scenarios used by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) do just that.

It is also useful to look at a few specific cases of [larger
countries]{.underline} that [have **absolutely decoupled**]{.underline}
emissions and GDP over the past 15 years.

[**accelerating trend** marks]{.underline} significant [**progress**

insufficient to meet the global climate target of net-zero carbon
emissions by 2050.

[Part 1: **Adaptation** to Climate]{.underline}

The [degrowth]{.underline} movement [asserts]{.underline} that [we can
only hope to address]{.underline} our climate challenges [by [reducing
econ]{.mark}omic [activity]{.mark} to reduce
g]{.underline}reen[h]{.underline}ouse [g]{.underline}a[s]{.underline}
emissions [and other resource draws]{.underline} on the earth, typically
through some form of global control of the economy. However, [this would
be **incredibly [counterproductive]{.mark}**]{.underline} for climate
adaptation as [it [would **dismantle**]{.mark} the]{.underline} primary
[**[phenomena]{.mark}** responsible for increasing]{.underline} the
human material [standard of living [that **fortifies**]{.mark} us
**[against]{.mark}**]{.underline} our often hostile
[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Economic productivity is]{.underline} typically measured with gross
domestic product (**[GDP]{.underline}**) per capita (the total
per-person monetary value of all goods and services produced). GDP per
capita is a popular target of critics. It is certainly an imperfect
measure of total human well-being, but it [represents a **good proxy**
for]{.underline} a society\'s [material **standard of
living**]{.underline}. In fact, GDP per capita is [strongly correlated
with]{.underline} many outcomes almost universally considered socially
desirable, including [higher life expectancy]{.underline}, [lower child
mortality]{.underline}, [higher educational attainment]{.underline},
[fewer working hours]{.underline}, [and higher self-reported life
satisfaction]{.underline}.

Furthermore, we see a [[**strong relationship** between
GDP]{.underline}]{.mark} per capita [[and **reduced vulnerability** to
climate]{.mark} over **space** and **time**]{.underline}. Over time,
almost [all climate-sensitive aspects]{.underline} of society have been
[trending in generally **positive directions** as GDP per capita has
**increased**]{.underline}. Over space, [[death]{.underline}]{.mark}
rates from natural disasters like floods, droughts, and storms are [**15
times [higher]{.mark}** [for **low-productivity**]{.mark} countries than
they are for **high-productivity** countries]{.underline}, and disaster
damages as a percentage of exposed GDP are much lower in
high-productivity nations. Finally, there is a [strong across-country
[relationship between **GDP**]{.mark}]{.underline} per capita
[[and]{.mark} measures of climate change **[adaptive capacity]{.mark}**,
such as]{.underline} the University of Notre Dame's climate [adaptation

The [**Agility** of Capitalism in **Climate Adaptation**]{.underline}

In his defense of a command economy, Karl Marx articulated that only
that which is planned is rational. When it came to attempts to implement
Marx's ideas, the most consequential hurdle has been finding benevolent
autocrats and planners. However, more relevant to the issue of climate
adaptation was Marx's supposition that technocratic planners could have
sufficient information and knowledge to be effectively rational, even if
they were benevolent. In contrast, Ludwig von Mises argued in 1920 that
"[socialism is the **abolition** of **rational economy**]{.underline},"
making the case that [without **private ownership** and **free-market
pricing** mechanisms]{.underline}, there is [**no way** of calculating
the most]{.underline} "**[rational]{.underline}**" [allocation of
resources]{.underline}. A [survey of]{.underline} the landscape of
[climate adaptive measures]{.underline} in productive economies [lends
**much more support** to von Mises]{.underline} than to Marx.

For example, as Anderson et al. discuss in their 2018 paper The Critical
Role of markets in climate adaptation, [markets]{.underline} in
agriculture [**effectively signal** emerging **climate
risks**]{.underline}, [prompting **adjustments**]{.underline} such as
changes in cropping patterns, irrigation practices, and even the
geographic shift of agricultural production to less vulnerable areas. If
certain crops become less viable in one region, they can be grown
elsewhere and traded on the global market, mediating any effect on the
total food supply. This is a specific example of the more general
principle of Ricardian comparative advantage, where, in this case,
capitalism naturally facilitates the efficient distribution of
production across the globe, allowing regions to specialize in the goods
and services for which they are best suited.

[Prices for labor]{.underline} (i.e., wages) [also **facilitate
adaptation** to climate change]{.underline}. As new challenges arise,
the demand for certain skills and occupations changes, [creating
incentives]{.underline} for workers to acquire new skills [and
transition into industries **critical** for **climate
adaptation**]{.underline}. For example, in agriculture, the need for
agronomists and environmental scientists to develop and implement new
climate-resilient practices may increase, driving labor toward these
areas.

These [dynamics]{.underline} tend to be [mediated through **private
firms**]{.underline}. John Deere, for example, has been behind the
[development of]{.underline} numerous [machines]{.underline} that have
[improved **crop productivity**]{.underline}, including recent precision
agriculture aided by GPS-guided tractors and other "**[smart
farming]{.underline}**" equipment that allows farmers to better optimize
planting, irrigation, and harvesting. Firms like Nutrien and Yara
International have developed advanced fertilizers that increase crop
productivity, and companies like Bayer have [innovated in gene editing,
facilitating the creation of **drought-resistant** and
**pest-resistant** crops]{.underline}.

When it comes to the [**infrastructure** that is critical for climate
resilience]{.underline}, basics like [**steel** were famously developed
by **icons of capitalism**]{.underline} like Andrew Carnegie. More
recently, [private firms]{.underline} like LafargeHolcim and CEMEX are
[behind the development of **high-performance concrete**]{.underline},
Saint-Gobain is behind the production of tempered glass five times
stronger than normal glass, and buildings, bridges, dikes, dams, etc.,
are assembled at relatively low cost with the help of Caterpillar and
Komatsu.

[Air conditioning]{.underline} has been critical for human protection
from heat, and this technology, too, has been greatly [pushed forward by
**private-sector competition**]{.underline}. While working for the
Buffalo Forge Company in 1902, Willis Carrier invented the first modern
air conditioning system and then founded Carrier Engineering
Corporation. They [**innovated** sufficiently]{.underline} to produce
products suitable for cooling large spaces. However, Frigidaire was the
first to introduce a unit small enough for residences in 1929, and its
design was supplanted by one from General Electric in the early 1930s.
Other improvements by General Motors primed the technology for an
explosion in adoption in the US in the middle of the century. Demand for
cooling systems was large due mostly to the climate not being tuned to
optimum human temperatures (not necessarily climate change), so
companies like Carrier, Trane, Daikin, and Lennox entered the market,
competing to improve efficiency and affordability. Through this
competition, innovations like variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems,
smart thermostats, and energy-efficient compressors were developed.

These [innovations]{.underline} have [helped make air conditioning
**accessible** to a **broad population**]{.underline}, [contributing to
widespread **adoption** and **protection** from extreme heat that has
undoubtedly saved an enormous number of lives]{.underline}. A common
critique of capitalism is that it leaves the poor behind, but as Joseph
Schumpeter argued, the record of capitalism is one of unprecedented
economic growth that benefits the poor the most. As he put it "The
[capitalist]{.underline} achievement does not typically consist in
providing more silk stockings for queens but in [bringing]{.underline}
them [within **steady reach** of factory girls in return for **steadily
decreasing** amounts of effort]{.underline}." Echoing this sentiment,
Matthew Khan makes the same case in the context of climate adaptation
via air conditioning:

"The market for air conditioning is an example. As outdoor temperatures
rise, people will increasingly demand more powerful air conditioning.
This aggregate demand creates a market for firms to design products to
meet this demand. Such mass production leads to economies of scale,
which lowers the cost per unit produced. As a result, lower-income
people can afford these goods. As lower-income people purchase such
adaptation-friendly products, they suffer less from extreme weather
events. Academics using big data can rigorously test whether the damage
caused by such extreme weather is shrinking for poorer people. If this
is the case, then this is direct evidence that capitalism is playing a
productive role in protecting the most vulnerable people from emerging
threats."

[Climate adaptation]{.underline} has [been a **resounding success**
in]{.underline} the modern era of [rapid capitalistic economic
growth]{.underline}, but we still have a very long way to go. Critics of
capitalism, including those in the degrowth movement, often advocate for
revolution on the grounds that the status quo is imperfect. They
frequently echo Jean-Jacques Rousseau's famous sentiment that "Man is
naturally good, and it is by his institutions alone that he becomes
evil." In putting forward their proposed alternatives, however, [they
are often committing the **Nirvana Fallacy**]{.underline}, where the
[supposed choice is between the **imperfect** status quo and a **perfect
utopian solution** rather than the choice being between alternative
**real-world** arrangements]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Jevon's paradox

#### Jevons paradox [oversimplifies]{.underline}. New technologies allow for [sustainable]{.underline} development.

**Dorr '22** (Adam Dorr, PhD UCLA\'s Luskin School of Public Affairs.
Director of the research program at RethinkX. "Rethinking the Jevons
Paradox: why more clean energy efficiency is good for the environment"
February 7 2022 https://www.rethinkx.com/blog/rethinking-jevons-paradox
//vo)

[The [Jevons paradox is **counterintuitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}
because, other things being equal, [we would normally expect higher
efficiency to cause lower resource use]{.underline}. The Jevons
paradox occurs, however, precisely because *other things are not
equal. *What is different is *demand*. [Although Jevons himself could
not have known about the concept of price elasticity of
demand]{.underline}, which still lay decades in the future at the time
he raised the issue, he did anticipate the essence of that idea. [He
also recognized that **[as energy became cheaper]{.mark}**, the total
rate of **[economic growth]{.mark}** across society [would
**increase**]{.mark} as well, because energy is an input to virtually
all other goods and services.]{.underline}

However, [The Jevons paradox is commonly invoked--and misinterpreted-in
environmental discourse to mean that new technologies are always worse
for the environment than older ones, even if they are more efficient.
This is not the case.]{.underline}

In a narrow technical sense, [the Jevons paradox only happens if a
[technology]{.mark} makes an existing process more efficient--and even
then, only if demand is highly sensitive to prices. But new
technology often **[obviates the old way of doing things]{.mark}
entirely**]{.underline}. Automobiles, for example, did not create a
Jevons paradox for horse manure, despite triggering a 10,000-fold
increase in freight and passenger miles traveled.

In a looser sense, [the Jevons paradox might be taken to mean that new
technologies always create new environmental problems]{.underline} of
their own. For example, combustion engine vehicles might have solved the
environmental problem of horse manure, but they created the new problems
of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. (Never mind the fact that
we would need more than 10 trillion horses to move freight and
passengers as many miles as we now do with vehicles). [But here again,
**[problems are not inevitable]{.mark}**. Digital cameras (and now
smartphones) did not create a Jevons paradox for celluloid film, nor
have they caused any other major new environmental problems, despite
triggering a billion-fold increase in image production.]{.underline}

The lesson here is that [[we cannot make]{.mark} lazy, **sweeping
[generalizations]{.mark}** about new technologies]{.underline}. Instead,
[**we need to [examine the environmental implications]{.mark}** of
technological advancements **[on a case-by-case basis]{.mark}**. In
other words, we need to make decisions about new technology **[based on
reason]{.mark}**, not ideology.]{.underline}

[Today, the technologies that are [driving]{.mark} the
[disruptions]{.mark} of energy, transportation and food **[will not
trigger a Jevons paradox]{.mark}** for fossil fuel consumption,
greenhouse gas emissions or other resources because they are not mere
incremental improvements in coal and gas power plants, combustion
engines or animal agriculture.]{.underline} Rather, they are
fundamentally different in nature.

[In energy, the three disruptive technologies are solar PV, wind
power and batteries (SWB). Because these technologies use no fossil
fuels or nuclear fuels, they will not cause a Jevons paradox for coal,
natural gas, petroleum or uranium, nor for the greenhouse gases or
nuclear waste associated with using them]{.underline}. Although SWB do
have other resource input requirements, these are comparable in scale to
those of the existing fossil fuel and nuclear power industry. Very
importantly, however, the resources needed for an SWB-based energy
system are only needed *once*. There is no fuel used or waste produced,
so after initial construction the maintenance and upkeep requirements
are minimal--especially for solar PV (which can operate for over 50
years) and grid-scale batteries (which can operate for over 20 years).
This means that after the initial pulse of resources needed to build out
SWB, the resource requirements of an SWB-based energy system will be
extremely low compared to today's energy system based on fossil fuels
and nuclear power.

In transportation, the technologies driving the disruption are electric
vehicles (EVs), autonomous driving and ride sharing that together
provides Transport-as-a-Service (TaaS). Unlike combustion engine
vehicles, EVs use no fuel. So these technologies will not cause a Jevons
paradox for gasoline or diesel fuel, nor the greenhouse gasses
associated with burning them. [Moreover, EVs require minimal maintenance
and can last 1 million miles]{.underline}, so each vehicle in a TaaS
fleet will be utilized much more than today's privately owned vehicles,
[which means that there will be a significant decrease in resource
intensity per vehicle mile traveled.]{.underline}

In food, the disruptive technologies are precision fermentation (making
proteins, fats and other food molecules with microbes) and cellular
agriculture (growing animal tissues without the animal), or PFCA. These
technologies will decimate the conventional animal agriculture and
seafood industries, slashing their resource intensity by a factor of up
to 100, and eliminating their greenhouse gas emissions almost entirely.
The food disruption will also free up over 2.5 billion hectares of
land--the size of the United States, Australia and China combined--from
livestock feed cropping, grazing, and pasturing. This windfall of
available land will open the door to reforestation, conservation and
rewilding opportunities at an unprecedented and previously unimaginable
scale.

[So, for most units of analysis (e.g. number of animals, land area,
greenhouse gases, etc.), there will be no Jevons paradox from the new
food technologies]{.underline}. However, even if we examine a unit of
analysis that will still be relevant, such as water intensity per
kilogram of protein produced, the food disruption will not cause a
Jevons paradox because the efficiency improvements are too extreme
compared to any possible changes in consumption. PFCA is 5 to 50 times
more water efficient than livestock per kilogram of protein produced,
depending on the animal species, and consumers are simply never going to
eat five times more protein no matter how cheap it gets, let alone 50
times more. (Human wants and needs are *not *infinite, contrary to
another widespread misconception in environmental discourse).

[The Jevons paradox is only a problem if resource utilization still
causes harm after switching to a new technology]{.underline}. Utilizing
energy is harmful if that energy comes from coal, but it is harmless if
that energy comes from the sun. Moreover, [**[impacts are only
harmful]{.mark}** in the aggregate if **[the rate of degradation exceeds
the rate of restoration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is possible, for
example, to extract timber from a landscape while
simultaneously *increasing* forest cover, so long as the rate of
extraction is lower than the rate of planting and reforestation. In
principle, [the same is true for many other forms of environmental
impact. This is a crucial consideration looking ahead over the next
several decades, because **[the same clean technologies that are
beginning to disrupt energy]{.mark}**, transportation and food
**[will]{.mark} also make [repai]{.mark}ring [past environmental
damage]{.mark}** and restoring ecological integrity **[feasible and
affordable]{.mark}** to an extent]{.underline} that previous generations
of environmental scientists, policymakers, planners and activists could
only dream of.

[The common misconceptions surrounding the Jevons paradox show that we
environmentalists need to rethink our pejorative presumptions about
technological progress. **Astonishing new [opportunities for]{.mark}
impact [mitigation and]{.mark} ecological [restoration]{.mark}** of all
kinds **[are now on offer]{.mark}** thanks to clean technologies, but in
order to seize them we must relinquish our ideologically based animosity
toward technology in general]{.underline}. These biases of the past no
longer serve the interests of either humanity or the rest of the natural
world. [[Technology]{.mark}, like any tool, is simply a practical form
of knowledge. A stunning new set of tools are now at hand, and **we [can
make]{.mark} enormous [changes for]{.mark} the [good]{.mark}** --
socially, economically and environmentally--if we choose to use them
wisely.]{.underline}

David Henderson points out that the [Jevons Fallacy is]{.underline}
indeed [an]{.underline}, umm, **[fallacy]{.underline}**. Unlike the
Jevons Paradox (increasing the efficiency with which a resource is used
can lead to an increase in the use of that resource) which is true in
interesting circumstances. David looks to the standard explanations and
is thus, of course, correct in [pointing out where the **fallacy
lies**]{.underline}. But it\'s entirely possible to pluck a story from
recent newspapers to show another manner in which the [fallacy is
**incorrect**]{.underline}.

Henderson:

Last century, William Stanley [Jevons]{.underline}, the famous economist
who was in part responsible for the marginal revolution, reasoned that
because the easy-to-get coal was already gotten, what was left was coal
that was harder and harder to reach. Therefore, he argued, [we would
reach a point where coal would be much **scarcer** and much more
**expensive**]{.underline}.

As I wrote in my bio of Jevons, [here was his **error**]{.underline}:

[Jevons failed to appreciate the fact that as the **price** of an energy
source **rises**]{.underline}, [entrepreneurs have a **strong
incentive** to invent]{.underline}, [develop]{.underline}, [and produce
**alternate sources**.]{.underline} In particular, [he did **not**
anticipate **oil** or **natural gas**]{.underline}. Also, [he did not
take account of the **incentive**]{.underline}, [as the price of coal
rose]{.underline}, [to use it more **efficiently** or to **develop
tech**nology that **brought down the cost** of discovering and
mining]{.underline} (see natural resources).

#### It's too [totalizing]{.underline}.

The Jevons [[Effect]{.underline}]{.mark} is
**[[counterintuitive]{.underline}]{.mark}** because, other things being
equal, we would [[normally expect]{.underline}]{.mark} higher efficiency
to cause **[[lower resource use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Jevons
Effect occurs, however, precisely because other things are not equal.
What is different is demand. Although Jevons himself could not have
known about the concept of price elasticity of demand, which still lay
decades in the future at the time he raised the issue, he did anticipate
the essence of that idea. He also recognized that as energy became
cheaper, the total rate of economic growth across society would increase
as well, because energy is an input to virtually all other goods and
services.

However, The Jevons Effect is commonly invoked -- and
[[misinterpreted]{.underline}]{.mark} -- in environmental discourse to
mean that new technologies are always worse for the environment than
older ones, even if they are more efficient. This is not the case.

In a narrow technical sense, the Jevons Effect
[[only]{.underline}]{.mark} happens [**[if]{.underline}**]{.mark} a
technology makes an [[existing process more
efficient]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and even then, only if demand is
highly sensitive to prices. But [[new tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
oft obviates the old way of doing things entirely. Automobiles, for
example, **[[did not]{.underline}]{.mark}** create a Jevons Effect for
horse manure, despite triggering a 10,000-fold increase in freight and
passenger miles traveled.

In a looser sense, the Jevons Effect might be taken to mean that new
technologies always create new environmental problems of their own. For
example, combustion engine vehicles might have solved the environmental
problem of horse manure, but they created the new problems of air
pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. (Never mind the fact that we
would need more than 10 trillion horses to move freight and passengers
as many miles as we now do with vehicles). But here again, problems are
not inevitable. Digital cameras (and now smartphones) did not create a
Jevons Effect for celluloid film, nor have they caused any other major
new environmental problems, despite triggering a billion-fold increase

The lesson here is that we cannot make lazy, sweeping generalizations
about new technologies. Instead, we need to examine the environmental
implications of technological advancements on a case-by-case basis. In
other words, we need to make decisions about new technology based on
reason, not ideology.

Today, the technologies that are [[driving]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} of energy, transportation, and food
will [[not trigger a Jevons Effect]{.underline}]{.mark} for fossil fuel
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, or other resources because they
are not mere incremental improvements in coal and gas power plants,

fundamentally different in nature.

In energy, the three disruptive technologies are
**[[solar]{.underline}]{.mark}** PV, **[[wind]{.underline}]{.mark}**

technologies use **[[no fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}** or nuclear
fuels, they [will [not cause a **Jevons Effect**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for coal, natural gas, petroleum, or uranium, nor for the greenhouse
gasses or nuclear waste associated with using them. Although SWB do have
other resource input requirements, these are comparable in scale to
those of the existing fossil fuel and nuclear power industry. Very

and so after initial construction the maintenance and upkeep

#### Jevon\'s is wrong. 

**Smith '20** \[Noah; economics PhD from the University of Michigan,
finance professor at Stony Brook University; 12-7-2020; Jevons\' Paradox
won\'t slow the energy transition,
https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/jevons-paradox-wont-slow-the-energy\]

\[ALL FIGURES OMITTED\]\
I've seen some people worry that [[Jevons' Paradox]{.underline}]{.mark}
will slow or even prevent the transition from fossil fuels to green
energy. But don't worry! This won't happen!

Jevons' Paradox [[is about **efficiency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. When you
get more efficient at providing something, sometimes you actually end up
using more of it instead of less. This is why policies that increase
energy efficiency can occasionally lead to higher energy usage.

But [[green]{.underline}]{.mark} energy [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}
isn't about efficiency; **[[it's about
substitution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Jevons' Paradox doesn't apply.

To see why, let's explain why Jevons' Paradox works. Suppose we're
talking about the market for oil. Let's represent this with a simple
supply-and-demand graph:

OK, so now suppose we become more efficient at using oil. Wikipedia
depicts this situation in the following way:

But cost doesn't just move on its own. What's really happening here is
that the [[supply curve]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which isn't shown in
the Wikipedia graph --- has **[[shifted to the
right]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If we become more efficient at turning oil
into energy, it means that sellers of energy are able to provide more
energy at any given price. So what's really happening is this:

If the increase in energy use is large enough (which happens if the blue
demand curve is flat enough, i.e. if demand is elastic enough), then it
actually causes an increase in oil usage, despite the fact that we got
more efficient at turning oil into energy! That's Jevons' Paradox.

OK, but now let's think about what happens when [[car batteries get
**cheaper**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is completely different from the
example above. Car batteries are a [[substitute]{.underline}]{.mark} for
oil. When substitutes for a good get cheaper, that good **[[falls in
price]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just think about pens and pencils. If pens
get cheaper, people become less willing to pay high prices for pencils,
since they can go buy cheap pens now instead. So demand for pencils
falls.

Car batteries and oil are just like that. When car batteries get cheap,
demand for oil falls. The situation looks like this:

Cheaper batteries mean that oil gets cheaper, and that we also use less
oil.

At this point, you might ask: "OK Noah, but energy gets cheaper as a
result of cheap batteries. Doesn't that mean that people will use more
energy, just like in the first example earlier? And doesn't that mean
that the people who still get their energy from oil will use more oil?"

Nope!

The reason is that in the second example, the cost of getting energy
from batteries goes down, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cost of
getting energy from oil stays **exactly the same**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
A barrel of oil still costs the same to pump out of the ground and
refine and deliver to the gas station. An internal combustion car still

**Book '24** \[Joakim; May 6; MSc in Economic History from the
University of Oxford, BSc in Economics and Economic History at the

It is often said that only a madman --- or economist --- could believe
that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet. [Resources are
**scarce** and **dwindling**, we're told]{.underline}. Day in and day
out, we seem [poised to use up some **civilization-critical
ingredient**, or we might **overuse** materials to the point of our own
**downfall**]{.underline}. 

[The **mindset** that makes people believe that we're **perennially** on
the cusp of **some disaster** is on display **everywhere**]{.underline}
from the big screen to the big assembly halls. It has been humanity's
plague since we first broke free of the Malthusian constraints that
govern every non-human ecology. And [never once do we seem to consider
that]{.underline} maybe, just maybe, the madmen/[**economists** know
something the **rest** of us **don't**]{.underline}. 

We're routinely [given **hyperbolic predictions** about our
doom]{.underline}, and no matter whether those predictions come true,
they're renewed in the same or slightly altered form a few years later.
[In the **meantime**, **individuals**, **businesses**, **workers**,
**investors**]{.underline}, tinkerers, and all the others that make up
the world economy [**solve** much of the "problem." **Every** popular
**scare** of the past has been side-stepped, improved, or solved, by one
or another **human effort**]{.underline}, usually serendipitously and
rarely at all with well-meaning bureaucrats directing the process.  

New York University economist Paul Romer, whose work on economic
growth rewarded him the Nobel Prize in 2018, explains that
"non-economists have said that \[his article\] helped them understand
why [**unlimited growth** is possible in a world with **finite
resources**]{.underline}." He credits that conclusion to his work on the
proliferation of ideas, which he condenses into the following two
statements: 

"[we can **share discoveries** with others," and]{.underline} 

"[there are **incomprehensibly many** discoveries **yet** to be
**found**]{.underline}."

The basic rationale is thus simple: "Although we live in a world of a
limited number of atoms," as Marian Tupy and Gale Pooley say in
their masterful creation Superabundance, "there are virtually infinite
ways to arrange those atoms. The possibilities for creating new value
are thus immense."

[Economic growth]{.underline} itself, said University of Mississippi
economist Josh Hendrickson in an interchange with The Guardian's George
Monbiot a few years ago, is [about "finding **more efficient** uses of
resources]{.underline}." It's about [observing how **market prices** and
the **profit motive** urge entrepreneurs and businesses to **economize**
on production while producing **more value**]{.underline} for consumers.
We can visibly see this in the products that technology has merged into
one (smartphones displacing a dozen or more physical appliances), or
the thinner cans or more efficient engines that innovation routinely
delivers. 

Economists aren't just playing word games when they say that growth can
keep going forever. [We can always **make more stuff**]{.underline}
since the physical atoms under our command right now are far from all
the physical atoms on our planet (or solar system). By growth,
economists mean value-creation exchanged in the marketplace, a market
that can change in the types of value we exchange, and the growing
portion of our economies can involve fewer atoms than what came before.

"Resource" which the general public think of as physical collections of
elements in the ground, economists define much more broadly.
[**Nothing** becomes a resource until the **human mind** makes
it]{.underline} so, i.e., "[there are no resources until **we find
them**]{.underline}, identify their possible uses, and develop ways to
obtain and process them" to quote Julian Simon, whose pioneering work in
resource economics prompted Tupy and Pooley to launch their
Superabundance project. 

The geologists muddy the water further. According to the British
Geological Survey, a "mineral resource" is the natural concentrations of
minerals or rocks that could be of economic interest, whereas "reserves"
are sites that have been submitted to testing and "has been fully
evaluated and is deemed commercially viable to work."

The boundaries between dirt, mineral resource, and mineral reserve can
therefore shift with technology, economic circumstances, or legal rules
regarding their extraction --- subject to the "degree of geological
certainty" and "feasibility of economic recovery."

What's even more incredible is that **[material abundance]{.underline}**
(how economically accessible certain minerals or agricultural products
are) [has historically speaking increased
with **population**]{.underline}. Instead of individually starving when
there are more humans on our supposedly finite planet, [we seem to be
collectively **producing more**, having **better access** to **raw
materials**]{.underline} and the goods and services we produce with
them. 

Take almost any foodstuff, meat or cereal, fruit or vegetable, for
almost any country over any period and the numbers go up and to the
right: For eight centuries (probably more), an English laborer has been
able to afford more and more foodstuffs for their labor; yet [there's
more food production today than at **any point** in the
past]{.underline}.

The counterintuitive conclusion follows naturally from Romer's work:
More humans give us more chances for ideas that exponentially "make
material progress possible." Human society is dynamic, not zero-sum.

[\<IMAGE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

Illustration: **[oil]{.underline}**. Thirteen years ago, Camilla Ruz
for The Guardian enumerated six natural resource scares to pay attention
to, of which oil was one. [**Dire predictions** like these are a **dime
a dozen** in the environmentalist world, and no matter how **publicly**
or **unequivocally** they are **disconfirmed** by reality, they pop
up]{.underline} with renewed vigor a few years later. At the time we had
some 46 years' worth of oil reserves left; that is, at the prices,
consumption rate, and technology of 2011, humanity would run out of oil
by the late 2050s. 

With a billion more people on the planet since then, having suitably
burned some 386 billion barrels of oil in the intervening years, we now
have... drumroll...48 years' usage in global proven reserves; [Humanity
will now last until the **2070s** before its (**supposedly limited**)
reserves of oil **run dry**]{.underline}. Disaster avoided. 

[The **price system**, **profit-hungry** entrepreneurs, and optimizing
**consumers** are pretty good at **remedying scarcities**]{.underline}
when they emerge. [If there **isn't enough**]{.underline} oil, gas,
wheat, gold, nickel, or copper for current human processes, [the (real)
price of those commodities **rise**]{.underline}; extracting [businesses
**dig deeper** or explore further, and consumers **substitute
away**]{.underline} from the expensive commodity, or we recycle
the metals that forever remain with us into something new. Higher prices
mean that lower-quality ores are now worth mining, more inaccessible
sources and geologists' best guesses for where we could find more worth
exploring. The outcome over decades and centuries is that "prices of
resources are declining because more people means more ideas, new
inventions and innovations," according to Tupy and Pooley. 

That we do not run out is the powerful lesson of both the history of
resources and the theory behind their economic uses: Our minds and the
black box of nifty ways to improve the world aren't limited. [We **don't
run out**; We simply **find more**]{.underline}. 

The recurring "we're running out of X!" [outrage]{.underline} therefore
seems so peculiar, so [**out of touch** with even a semblance of
**reality**]{.underline}. 194 years ago, before having seen but a tiny
fraction of the improvements humanity would make over the following
decades and centuries, British historian and poet Thomas Babington
(raised to the peerage as Lord Macaulay) wrote 

though in every age everybody knows that up to his own time progressive
improvement has been taking place, nobody seems to reckon on any
improvement during the next generation. We cannot absolutely prove that
those are in error who tell us that society has reached a turning point
\[...\] but so said all who came before us, and with just as much
apparent reason.

It is, in some ways, [a repeat of **1940**]{.underline}. [In the face of
chaos]{.underline}, [the global **economy powers on**]{.underline}.
Since 2011 [growth has continued at around **3% a year**]{.underline}.
During the worst of the [**euro crisis** in 2012]{.underline}? Around
[3%]{.underline}. What about [2016]{.underline}, [the year Britain voted
for **Brexit** and America for Donald **Trump**]{.underline}, or
[2022]{.underline}, [when Russia invaded **Ukraine**]{.underline}? Also
[3%]{.underline}. The exception was in 2020-21, [during the
**pandemic**]{.underline}. When governments introduced lockdowns, many
feared a slump to rival the Depression. In fact, [over the following two
years]{.underline} the world ground out [annual GDP growth of
2%]{.underline}; [one year of contraction]{.underline}, [followed by a
**storming recovery**]{.underline}.

[The world economy appears impressively and increasingly
**shock-absorbent**]{.underline}. [Supply chains]{.underline} in
goods---widely believed to be a source of fragility---[have shown
themselves to be **resilient**]{.underline}. A more [**diverse** supply
of **energy** and a less fossil-fuel-intensive economy have **reduced**
the impact of]{.underline} changes in the **[oil]{.underline}** price.
And across the world, economic [policymaking has
**improved**]{.underline}. According to the conventional narrative, the
"great moderation", a period of steady growth and predictable
policymaking, ran from the late 1980s to the global financial crisis of
2007-09. But perhaps it did not die alongside Lehman Brothers.

This year just 5% of countries are on track for a recession, according
to IMF data---the least since 2007. [**Unemployment** in
the OECD]{.underline} club of rich countries [is below
**5%**]{.underline} and close to a record low. [In]{.underline} the
first quarter of [2025 global corporate **earnings** rose by
**7%**]{.underline} year on year. [Emerging **markets**]{.underline},
long prone to capital flight in times of trouble, now [tend to **avoid**
currency or debt **crises**]{.underline} (see chart 3). Consumers across
the world, despite claiming to be down in the dumps, spend freely. [On
almost any measure]{.underline}, [the economy is basically
fine]{.underline}.

Little wonder that [**investors** are **optimistic**]{.underline}. Over
the past 15 years, [as the polycrisis has built]{.underline}, American
[**stocks** have marched **upwards**]{.underline}. More than [half the
rich world's stockmarkets are within **5%** of their all-time
**high**]{.underline}. Wall Street's fear gauge,
[the **VIX**]{.underline}, an index of stockmarket volatility, [is
running **below** its]{.underline} long-term [average]{.underline}.
[Markets **fell**]{.underline} in April, [when]{.underline} Mr [Trump
announced]{.underline} his "Liberation Day" **[tariffs]{.underline}**,
[but quickly **recouped**]{.underline} their losses. Many investors now
follow a simple rule whenever markets decline: "[Buy the
dip]{.underline}."

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Supply Chains\-\--2AC

#### [Innovation]{.underline}, [government]{.underline} support, and a transition from [goods]{.underline} to [services]{.underline} prove resiliency.

Out of the fire

The emergence of a new form of capitalism, which could be called "[the
**teflon economy**]{.underline}", may be behind these shifts. On one
side of the equation, [**firms** are **better** than ever at dealing
with shocks]{.underline}, meaning [markets continue to
**function**]{.underline} even at a time when politics breaks down. On
the other side, [**governments** offer their economies **unprecedented**
levels of **protection**]{.underline}.

Start with supply chains. The conventional narrative that they are prone
to "[failure]{.underline}" [is largely wrong]{.underline}. During the
pandemic some [commodities]{.underline} [became]{.underline} a lot more
[expensive]{.underline}---but [this was a **consequence**
of]{.underline} an enormous surge in **[demand]{.underline}**, rather
than falling supply. [Semiconductors are a classic example]{.underline}.
In 2021 [chipmakers shipped 1.2trn units]{.underline}, some [15% more
than the year before]{.underline}. The industry did not really suffer a
"supply crunch". Rather, it responded well to an extreme surge in
demand.

According to the New York Fed's supply-chain pressure index,
[**bottlenecks** have remained in **line** with the long-run
**average**]{.underline}, even in the face of Mr Trump's trade war. We
find similar results in our [**analysis** of **33,000**
commodities]{.underline} that America imported from 1989 to 2024. For
each year, we counted the number where imports declined from the
previous year by more than 20%, even as the price of those imports rose
by more than 20%. This hints at situations where a supply chain
genuinely "fails". We calculate that [the **failure rate** has been
**trending down** over time]{.underline}.

Modern supply chains are resilient because [they are **professionally
run**]{.underline}. Specialised logistics [firms have **global
reach**]{.underline}, [with cutting-edge **warehousing** and transport
**capabilities**]{.underline}. [Better **communications** enable
rerouting]{.underline} when required. Lots of people have jobs that in
effect amount to finding the most marginal of marginal gains. In America
there are 95% more supply-chain managers than two decades ago.

Some investors believe [**structural changes**]{.underline} to the
economy [are also playing a part]{.underline}. "[A **services economy**
is incredibly consistent]{.underline}," says Rick Rieder, chief
investment officer for fixed-income markets at BlackRock, the world's
largest asset manager. "They really do not go into recession except when
there is a real major shock: a pandemic or a financial crisis." Since
1990, [goods **consumption** in America has **fallen**]{.underline} on a
quarter-on-quarter basis in 27 quarters. Spending on services, by
contrast, has contracted in only five quarters.

[Fast **growth** in]{.underline} American shale [**oil** and **gas**
production has made the world **less dependent**]{.underline} on both
[Russia and the Middle East]{.underline}, as became apparent after Mr
Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which failed to produce the deep recession
in Europe expected by many analysts. [**OPEC** produced fewer than **33m
barrels**]{.underline} of oil [a day]{.underline} last year, just 12%
more than in 1973, [when the cartel curtailed production]{.underline}
and sent prices rocketing. At the same time, [the **rest** of the world
produced **64m barrels**]{.underline} of oil [a day]{.underline}, a
figure that has more than doubled since the oil shock of the 1970s.
Moreover, [the]{.underline} global [economy is becoming less
dependent]{.underline} on the fuel: [oil **intensity**]{.underline},
defined as the amount consumed per unit of GDP, [has
**dropped**]{.underline} by around 60% since 1973 (see chart 5). Hence
why events such as the recent Israeli and American bombing of Iran
barely dent the price of crude.

Excellent as supply-chain agility may be, it would matter less if
consumer demand crashed every time sentiment soured. That does not
happen, in large part because of government action.
[Politicians]{.underline} in the rich world [have become extreme
**fiscal activists**]{.underline}. During the pandemic, [they spent over
**10% of GDP** on **rescue**]{.underline} packages. In 2022, [during the
**energy crisis**]{.underline}, [the average European government spent
another **3%**]{.underline} of GDP. In 2023, in the middle of a banking
scare, America hugely expanded its deposit insurance. When there is bad
news, politicians are quick to spend big.

And even when there is no bad news, politicians spend big just to be
sure. [The average **rich-country**]{.underline} government now [runs
a]{.underline} fiscal [**deficit** of over **4%** of GDP]{.underline},
far above the norm in the 1990s and 2000s. Their support goes beyond
budget deficits, which are simple to measure. Many countries now have
vast "contingent liabilities"---off-balance-sheet commitments that
nonetheless represent an enormous potential outlay. America's federal
government is on the hook for contingent liabilities worth more than
five times the country's GDP. When [the **feds** are **backstopping**
the entire economy]{.underline}, it is hardly surprising that
[**recessions** are **few** and far between]{.underline}.

national debt.\" Fortune. 9/18/2023.
https://fortune.com/2023/09/18/janet-yellen-national-debt/

The U.S. national debt is nearing \$33 trillion, but Janet
[[Yellen]{.underline}]{.mark} isn't worried just yet. The Treasury
Secretary [[pointed to a]{.underline}]{.mark} key
**[[statistic]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Monday
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}, she believes,
[[illustrates]{.underline}]{.mark} that the federal government's growing
[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark} burden [[remains **under
control**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[The **[statistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} or metric that [I look
at]{.underline} most often to judge our fiscal course [[is **net
interest** as a **share of GDP**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she told CNBC
Monday, referring to the net payments the federal government makes on
its debt relative to U.S. gross domestic product. "[[And even with the
**rise**]{.mark} we have seen [in]{.mark} interest [**rates** that
remains at a]{.mark} very [**reasonable** level]{.mark}]{.underline}."

To Yellen's point, [the]{.underline} federal government's interest
[[**payments** represented **1.86% of GDP**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
2022, according to Federal Reserve data. [That's [in line with
the]{.mark} historical [**average** since **1960**]{.mark}
of]{.underline} just [under 2%.]{.underline}

Yellen said [she is]{.underline} still "[[not]{.mark} really
[**concerned** about]{.mark} the impact]{.underline}" [that]{.underline}
recent federal [**[spending]{.mark}** programs]{.underline}---including
the CHIPS and Science Act that subsidizes semiconductor production and
research and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that authorizes
spending on roads, bridges, and other infrastructure projects---[will
have [on the]{.mark} national **[deficit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, arguing
the federal government just needs "to make sure that we stay on a
sustainable course."

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Stranded Assets\-\--2AC

#### No stranded assets. Buffers [check]{.underline}.

\[\[Footnotes\]\]

On average, large BHCs lend at around fifty percent (or lower) LTC/LTV.
67 This means that a big bank's loan is very unlikely to become impaired
unless the borrower's cost of doing business increases by fifty percent
(where the LTC measure was used) or the value of its collateral declines
by fifty percent (where the LTV measure was used). Accordingly, a
corporate or home borrower would have to realize losses of fifty percent
or more due to physical or transition risks in order for climate change
to have reduced the quality of asset values on a bank's balance sheet.68
More on this to follow.69

\[\[FN 68-9\]\]

68\. [The stranded asset problem seems]{.underline} even more
**[remote]{.underline}** where securitization is concerned. Again,
understanding underwriting is important. By virtue of that process,
[[banks]{.mark} are likely to [have]{.mark} **very [few]{.mark}**
[incentives]{.mark} (let alone [**approvals** from]{.mark}]{.underline}
their [[risk committees) to **securitize**]{.underline}]{.mark} pools of
[loans to]{.underline}, for example, [**[coal]{.mark}**
companies]{.underline} (or from analogously carbon-concentrated pools).
[To do so **would defy** the very purpose of]{.underline}
securitization---risk and geographic **[diversification]{.underline}**.
For that reason, [it seems]{.underline} equally
**[improbable]{.underline}** that [a bond would be **rated** investment
grade]{.underline}, thereby [**limiting demand** for such a
product]{.underline}. Moreover, [given the
**[growing]{.mark}**]{.underline} investor-driven
[[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} that [financial **institutions** should
**step [away]{.mark}** [from carbon]{.mark}]{.underline}-facing
[[assets, **demand** will]{.mark} likely [be]{.mark} **quite

"\[w\]hile accurately-priced risk and returns are part of the typical

is subject to much more robust underwriting now as well. [Banks are now
much more **incentivized** than]{.underline} they were
[before]{.underline} 20[**[08]{.mark}** to conduct **due diligence**
on]{.underline} the [loans]{.underline} that they packaged in

now **require banks** to retain a]{.underline} five percent
**[first-loss]{.underline}** or 'vertical' [**piece** of
any]{.underline} securitized [**bond** that they sell. This
[**forces**]{.mark} banks to keep some "**[skin in the
game]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} by ensuring their diligence and
underwriting practices are robust to any and all manners of risk
associated with the loans that form the basis for a securitization.

\[\[END FN 68-9\]\]

Perhaps most squarely to the point, it appears that [banks may
[not]{.mark}]{.underline} presently [[hold sufficient]{.mark}
concentration of **[carbon]{.mark}**-intensive credit
**[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} for physical or transition risks [[to
threaten]{.mark} their **[solvency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 70 Consider a
snapshot based on existing data. These [big bank balance **sheets** are
geographically and sectorally **diversified**]{.underline}.71 Consider
recent data from the balance sheets of the largest, most systemically
important banks. For example, at year end 2019, JPMorgan [**Chase**
had]{.underline} \$41,570 million in wholesale credit exposures in its
oil and gas portfolio.72 While that number seems enormous, it is
[**4.6** percent of that bank's total **credit**]{.underline} exposure.
(That number decreased to \$37,516 million by the end of 2020.73)

At [the highest]{.underline} range [is **Citigroup**, whose]{.underline}
credit [exposure]{.underline} in the energy and commodities industry
[constitutes]{.underline} around [**seven** percent of its total
credit]{.underline} exposure for its corporate credit portfolio.74
[**Yet** other]{.underline} globally systemically [important banks such
as **Wells Fargo**, BNY **Mellon**, and **Barclays** fall
at]{.underline} the lower end of the [**four** to seven **percent**
exposure range]{.underline} in their portfolios (when looking at their
exposure to the oil and gas industry respectively).75 Meanwhile, [the
[**amount**]{.mark} of]{.underline} equity [capital available **[to
absorb]{.mark}** loan [losses is]{.mark}]{.underline} triple or
**[[quadruple]{.underline}]{.mark}** credit [[exposure at all]{.mark} of
[these]{.mark} big banks]{.underline}.76

Taking automotive industry loans into account changes these banks'
exposure slightly, but not significantly. 77 For example, JPMorgan's and
Wells Fargo's wholesale credit exposure increases by less than four
percent each, while Citigroup's credit exposure increases by 6.86
percent.78 This remains true even when panning out wider to account for
loans across the entire transportation industry. Including
transportation increases JPMorgan's credit exposure by less than two
percent, Citigroup's by less than four percent, Wells Fargo's by around
2.5 percent, and Barclays's around one percent.79 Banks are otherwise
diversified across a range of sectors: real estate, consumer and retail,
technology, industrials, asset managers, banks and financial companies,
healthcare, utilities, state and municipal governments, automotive,
chemicals and plastics, metals and mining, central governments,
transportation, insurance, securities firms, and financial market
infrastructures.80

Events of 2020 lend support to the narrative suggested by the balance
sheet data discussed above. Specifically, [in]{.underline} spring of
**[2020]{.underline}**, large [banks faced **historic** declines in
**[oil prices]{.mark}** (which fell [**below zero**]{.mark} dollars)
thanks to **COVID**]{.underline}-related shelter-in-place orders. 81
[While banks **suffered** some]{.underline} losses on their wholesale
credit portfolios connected to the oil and gas industry,82
[their]{.underline} soundness or [[**solvency**]{.mark} did [not]{.mark}
come into **[question]{.mark}**]{.underline}.83 Indeed, the Fed's own
data shows no statistically significant increase in nonperforming loans
between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 for the largest banks84---for further
context, while nonperforming loans were at about one percent of these
banks' balance sheets after these events of 2020, shortly after the
financial crisis of 2008 they hovered around 3.5 percent. 85 These
recent events---and banks' balance sheet reactions---suggest that [even
**significant**]{.underline} exogenous [climate-related **shocks**
[cannot]{.mark} so [drastically impair **asset quality**]{.mark} so as
to push banks toward **insolvency**]{.underline}. 86 The lesson here is
that where banks remained resilient, in accordance with Basel III
requirements, they have been able

investments in [fossil fuels]{.underline} altogether [saw **superior**
returns]{.underline}, a new report from an independent economics
non-profit has revealed.

Looking at a range of major stock market indices,
**[researchers]{.underline}** at the Institute for Energy Economics and
Financial Analysis (IEEFA) in Ohio [found that, across the
board]{.underline}, an **[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** of \$10,000
[[saw]{.underline}]{.mark} both markedly [[**weaker growth** and
**higher risk**]{.mark} in]{.underline} passive funds that included
[fossil fuels]{.underline}, over five- and 10-year periods.

Even taking into account an energy crisis and surge in prices following
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the researchers discovered that
[**dropping** oil, gas and coal stocks]{.underline} from portfolios
[proved a **winning** investment strategy]{.underline} in the medium and
long term.

The findings, released Thursday, pour cold water on the conventional
idea that fossil fuel stocks offer a safe bet, IEEFA research associate
Connor Chung tells me.

"[There was an age when fossil fuels underpinned]{.underline} much of
broader [market performance]{.underline},\" Chung says. \"This era
continues to shape a lot of investors' worldviews, even as
**[markets]{.underline}** these days [tell a]{.underline} drastically
[**different** story]{.underline}.\"

\"Fiduciaries need a wake-up call,\" he continues. \"Climate risk is
financial risk, and few sectors illustrate this better than fossil
fuels. A goal of this report is to help investors understand just how
far the traditional energy sector has fallen.\"

[Recent decades]{.underline} have [seen a]{.underline} rapid
[**decline** in fortunes]{.underline} for the fossil fuel sector, which
in 1980 comprised some 30% of the weight of the S&P 500, but now stands
at just 3.9%. Despite this, the under-performance of the sector
continues to act as a significant drag on equity markets, the
researchers found, noting that the energy sector trailed the performance
of the S&P 500 in eight of the 10 years between 2012 and 2021, and
placed dead last in five of those years.

The report notes that much of the optimism pinned on [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent years has been attached not to
their stability, but to their **[volatility]{.underline}**, depending on
[**unpredictable** crises and bad actors]{.underline} to [[deliver
**shocks**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the system. With competition from
less volatile and cheaper renewable energy sources growing rapidly,
**[[hydrocarbon]{.underline}]{.mark}**
producer**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** may [[find it]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[**difficult** to **offer**]{.underline}]{.mark} managed
[shareholder **[value]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, the authors warn, a growing assortment of material
**[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} physical
risk in the form of increased [[**flooding**, to]{.underline}]{.mark}
legal risk from [the [rising]{.mark} tide]{.underline} [of climate
**[litigation]{.mark}**]{.underline} worldwide---[make]{.underline} the
[long-term prospects]{.underline} for oil, coal and gas investments look
ever more [bleak]{.underline}.

[Conventional investment **theses**]{.underline}, then, [are being
**upended**]{.underline}.

\"[The era of]{.underline} stable, blue-chip [**returns** from the
fossil fuel sector is]{.underline} long **[gone]{.underline}**," says
IEEFA researcher Dan Cohn, a co-author of the report. "Now,
[**[every]{.mark}** major [**investment house** has
**developed**]{.mark} investment products with [**sustainable**
mandates]{.mark}. These mandates **reflect**]{.underline} the [fossil
fuel]{.underline} sector['s **underperformance**, its **negative**
long-term **outlook**]{.underline}, [and increasing demand
for]{.underline} investment products with dramatically less or [no
fossil fuels]{.underline}."

While acknowledging that \"past results are no guarantee of future
outcomes\", the IEEFA sounds a further warning to investors still
weighing the pros and cons of oil, gas and coal.

"[**[Disruption]{.mark}** and **destabilization**]{.underline} in fossil
fuel commodity markets, [**[competition]{.mark}** from
renewable]{.underline} energy, the
**[[electrification]{.underline}]{.mark}** of transport,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} growing investor consciousness of
[**[climate]{.mark}** change's financial risks are **driving** investors
to [**re-evaluate** fossil fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} place in
the portfolio," Chung says. "As the economies of the past and the future
collide, the fossil fuel sector is not prepared to manage the challenges
of the coming decades. Investors have a responsibility to act."

### Sustainability\-\--AT: K-Curves\-\--2AC

#### [KUZNETS CURVE]{.underline}. Growth makes people [want]{.underline} to reduce risk.

**Aschenbrenner '20** \[Leopold; September 6; Research Fellow in
Economics at the Forethought Foundation and Global Priorities Institute
at the University of Oxford, B.A. from Columbia University; Global
Priorities Institute, "Existential risk and growth," no. 6\]

Moreover, the (impatient) optimal allocation represents what I would
call the "democratic possibilities frontier" or the "impatient public
possibilities frontier." Those who are principally concerned about the
long-run future of humanity and advocate for a zero rate of pure time
preference might want us to spend as much as possible on safety in order
to avoid existential catastrophe and enable human flourishing millions
of years into the future. Indeed, even in the Hamiltonian of the optimal
allocation, the relative value of life ˜vt is a discounted term; the
lower your discount rate ρ, the more you would want to spend on safety.
However, the broader public is not so patient. As the empirical evidence
cited earlier shows, people tend to have a (relatively large) positive
rate of pure time preference; the public is impatient. Even perfectly
designed institutions that take into account existential risk
externalities will ultimately be constrained by the degree to which
society actually cares about the future---they will be constrained by an
impatient public. [[The]{.mark} **[e]{.mark}**xistential risk
**[K]{.mark}**uznets **[c]{.mark}**urve [illustrates]{.mark} the
implications]{.underline} of this impatience. On the one hand, this
impatience results in a period of initially rising levels of risk. For
example, this might mean that [the]{.underline} arguably [rising level
of existential risk of the past century is **not** necessarily a
**market** failure, but]{.underline} may well be part of [the **[optimal
path]{.mark}** given positive pure time preference]{.underline}. On the
other hand, [rising **standards** of living lead]{.underline} even
[the]{.underline} most impatient [[**public** to]{.mark} start caring
more about safety and **[averting]{.mark}** an existential
[**catastrophe**.]{.mark} This leads workers and scientists]{.underline}
to be [shifted to the safety sector]{.underline}, eventually [causing
the [hazard rate]{.mark}]{.underline} δ [[to]{.mark} exponentially
**[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even if people are impatient, if you
make them well off enough, they will start caring about existential
risk.]{.underline}

#### K-curves are wrong. 

**Modis '21** \[Theodore; December 17; physicist with a Ph.D. in physics
from Columbia University and has worked at CERN and Digital Equipment
Corporation; OSF Preprints; "A Hard-science Approach to Kondratieff's
Economic Cycle"\]

There are some deviations of the data from the regular cyclical pattern.
The cycle of energy consumption shown in Figure 2 seems to diminish in
amplitude and shorten in period toward the end of the 20th century and
the beginning if the 21st. Given that the U.S. leads the world by seven
years or so, conceivably these irregularities will soon show up in the
worldwide data of Figure 3. Other irregularities during recent times
like those seen for bank failures and women Nobel laureates could be
related. Could it be that the [[Kondratieff cycle is **diminishing** as
a **phenomenon**]{.underline}]{.mark}? A recent article by Russian
economists raises the possibility of the end of this phenomenon based on
globalization arguments.\[21\]

Another reason for a diminishing Kondratieff cycle may be
[[reflexivity]{.underline}]{.mark}, namely the fact that [[once people
become **aware** of a situation, their behavior may try to **change**
the situation to their advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
notion---akin to the notion of a self-fulfilling prophecy and the
Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)---has been known in one form or
another throughout the 20th century, be it in sociology or in the world
of investments as EMH. Reflexivity received more limelight in economics
following the crash of 2008.

Despite the irregularities mentioned above I believe that Figures 2-11
present a compelling case---at least visually---for the existence of
Kondratieff's cycle. And dealing with unambiguously defined and
accurately measured physical variables enhances the reliability of this
conclusion. In the wake of the publication of my first book
Predictions---in which most of these graphs were presented with data
that stopped in the late 1980s---a reviewer in Science wrote:\[22\]
"\... he (Modis) does cite the relationship of his 'overall' 56-year
cycles and evidence on the associated clustering of technological
innovations to prior work by Kondratieff and Schumpeter (in my opinion,
Modis' evidence on these topics is more extensive and compelling than
that of either of these scholars.)"

And yet, the [[average correlation]{.underline}]{.mark} from all the
graphs in these ten figures [[is **0.576**]{.underline}]{.mark} implying
only 33% of the patterns' behaviors can be explained by a regular cycle
(a sine wave). In my career I have published over 100 articles in
scientific and business journals, some of which I am proud of.
Unfortunately, the publication that has drawn most attention, if I judge
by the number of reads reported in ResearchGate, is an article titled
"Sunspots, GDP, and the Stock Market" that reports evidence for some
correlation between stock-market moves and sunspot activity.\[23\]
However, it is possible that a series of numbers generated randomly also
correlates in a non-negligible way with a given time series. I have made
a simulation study to explore the possible correlation of randomly
generated data with sunspot-activity data. I generated 25,000 time
series with random data normally distributed with an average and a sigma
equal to those of the sunspot data. Figure 12 shows one example where
the random data seem to correlate significantly with the sunspot data.
For every one of the sunspot peaks (intermittent line), rather regularly
spaced every 11 years, there is a corresponding peak in the random data
(gray line), and six of the eight peaks line up rather well. An
uninformed reader would be hard-pressed to say that all this lining-up
is accidental. And yet, the correlation coefficient is 0.42 implying
that only 18% of the gray line can be explained by the intermittent
line.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

Figure 12 Random Data and Sunspots. Sunspot activity (intermittent line)
and randomly generated data (gray line). Correlation r = 0.42, r 2 = 18

Figure 13 shows a histogram of the correlations with sunspots for the
25,000 randomly generated events. As expected, the average correlation
is zero, meaning there is no correlation. But there is a distribution
indicating a probability of 2.5% for correlations with \|r\| ≧ 0.45. In
other words 25 times in a thousand, such correlation---which is not far
from the average correlation in Figures 2-11---can emerge with randomly
generated data. And this should be taken as a limit because similar
simulations for variables with less structure than sunspots---Figures
6-8 display only 2 to 3 periods as opposed to 8 periods for
sunspots---would yield more correlation with random events more easily.

In order for their discoveries not to be accidental observations
physicists demand confidence levels of 99.99997% (five sigma), or about
1 in 3.5 million chances of being wrong. "Softer" scientists may settle
for confidence levels of 99.73% (three sigma), or 27 in 10,000. One way
or another, the evidence for the [[existence of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Kondratieff [[cycle]{.underline}]{.mark} presented in this article
[[would be **challenged** to claim scientific
**rigor**]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus acquire the characterization of
"a scientific discovery". Therefore economists like Murray Rothbard will
be allowed to continue denying the very existence of this phenomenon

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Militarization

#### Militarization is not tied to capitalism, the profit motive deters war.

**MacKenzie '03** (D.W. MacKenzie, assistant professor at Carroll
College, "Does Capitalism Require War?" April 7 2003
https://mises.org/mises-daily/does-capitalism-require-war //vo)

[History is rife with examples of imperialism]{.underline}. The Romans,
Alexander, and many others of the ancient world waged imperialistic
wars. The Incan Empire and the empire of Ancient China stand as examples
of the universal character of imperialism. Who could possibly claim that
imperialism grew out of the prosperity of these ancient civilizations?
[**[Imperialism precedes]{.mark} modern industrial [capitalism]{.mark}**
by many centuries. Uneven wealth distribution or underconsumption under
**[cap]{.mark}italism [obviously did not cause]{.mark}** these instances
of **[imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, this fact does not
prove that modern capitalism lacks its own imperialistic tendencies.

[The notion that income gets underspent or maldistributed lies at the
heart of most claims that capitalism either needs or produces
imperialistic wars]{.underline}. As J.B. Say argued, supply creates its
own demand through payments to factors of production. Demand Side
economists Hobson and Keynes argued that there would be too little
consumption and too little investment for continuous full employment. We
save too much to have peace and prosperity.

[The difficulty we face is not in oversaving, but in underestimating the
workings of markets and the desires of consumers]{.underline}.
Doomsayers have been downplaying consumer demand for ages. As demand
side economist J.K. Galbraith claimed, we live in an affluent society,
where most private demands have been met. Of course, Hobson made the
same claim much earlier. Earlier and stranger still, mercantilists
claimed that 'wasteful acts' such as tea drinking, gathering at
alehouses, taking snuff, and the wearing of ribbons were unnecessary
luxuries that detracted from productive endeavors.

[The prognostications of esteemed **[opponents of capitalism]{.mark}**
have consistently **[failed to predict]{.mark} consumer
[demand]{.mark}**. Today, consumers consume at levels that few long ago
could have imagined possible]{.underline}. There is no reason to doubt
that consumers will continue to press for ever higher levels of
consumption. Though it is only a movie, Brewster's Millions illustrates
how creative people can be at spending money. People who do actually
inherit, win, or earn large sums of money have little trouble spending
it. Indeed, wealthy individuals usually have more trouble holding on to
their fortunes than in finding ways to spend them. We are never going to
run out of ways to spend money.

Many of the complaints about capitalism center on how people save too
much. One should remember that there really is no such thing as saving.
Consumers defer consumption to the future only. As economist Eugen
Böhm-Bawerk demonstrated, people save according to time preference.
Savings diverts resources into capital formation. This increases future
production. Interest enhanced savings then can purchase these goods as
some consumers cease to defer their consumption.

Keynes' claim that animal spirits drive investment has no rational
basis. Consumer preferences are the basis for investment. Investors
forecast future consumer demand. Interest rates convey knowledge of
these demands. The intertemporal coordination of production through
capital markets and interest rates is not a simple matter. But Keynes'
marginal propensities to save and Hobson's concentration of wealth
arguments fail to account for the real determinants of production
through time.

Say's Law of Markets holds precisely because [**[people]{.mark} always
[want a better life]{.mark}** for themselves and those close to
them]{.underline}. Falling interest rates deter saving and increase
investment. Rising interest rates induce saving and deter investment.
[This simple logic of [supply and demand derives from]{.mark} a quite
basic notion of [self interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. Keynes denied that
the world worked this way. Instead, he claimed that bond holders hoard
money outside of the banking system, investment periodically collapses
from 'the dark forces of time and uncertainty, and consumers save income
in a mechanical fashion according to marginal propensities to save. None
of these propositions hold up to scrutiny, either deductive or
empirical.

Speculators do not hoard cash outside of banks. To do this means a loss
of interest on assets. People do move assets from one part of the
financial system to another. This does not cause deficient aggregate
demand. Most money exists in the banking system, and is always available
for lending.

In fact, the advent of e-banking makes such a practice even less
sensible. Why hoard cash when you can move money around with your
computer? It is common knowledge that people save for homes, education,
and other expensive items, not because they have some innate urge to
squirrel some portion of their income away. This renders half of the
market for credit rational.

[**[Investors]{.mark}** do in fact **[calculate]{.mark} [rates of
return]{.mark} on investment**. This is not a simple matter. Investment
entails some speculation. Long term investment projects entail some
uncertainty, but investors who want to actually reap profits will
estimate the returns on investment using the best available
data]{.underline}. Keynes feared that the dark forces of time and
uncertainty could scare investors. This possibility, he thought, called
for government intervention. [However, **[government
intervention]{.mark}** (especially warfare) generally **[serves to
increase uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Private markets have
enough uncertainties without throwing politics into the fray. The
vagaries of political intervention serve only to darken an already
uncertain future. Capital markets are best left to
capitalists.]{.underline}

[Nor is [capital]{.mark} not extracted surplus value. It comes not from
exploitation. It [is]{.mark} simply [a matter of]{.mark} people
[valuing]{.mark} their [future wellbeing]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Capitalists will hire workers up to the point where the discounted
marginal product of their labor equals the wage rate. To do otherwise
would mean a loss of potential profit. Since workers earn the marginal
product of labor and capital derives from deferred consumption, Marxist
arguments about reserve armies of the unemployed and surplus extraction
fail.

It is quite odd to worry about capitalists oversaving when many complain
about how the savings rate in the U.S. is too low. Why does the U.S., as
the world's 'greatest capitalist/imperialist power', attract so much
foreign investment? Many Americans worry about America's international
accounts. Fears about foreigners buying up America are unfounded, but
not because this does not happen. America does have a relatively low
national savings rate. It does attract much foreign investment,
precisely because it has relatively secure property rights. Indeed, much
of the third world suffers from too little investment. The claims of
Marxists, and Hobson, directly contradict the historical record. Sound
theory tells us that it should. The Marxist claim that capitalists must
find investments overseas fails miserably.

Larry Kudlow has put his own spin on the false connection between
capitalism and war. We need the War as shock therapy to get the economy
on its feet. Kudlow also endorses massive airline subsidies as a means
of restoring economic prosperity.

Kudlow and Krugman both endorse the alleged destructive creation of
warfare and terrorism. Kudlow has rechristened the Broken Window fallacy
the Broken Window principle. Kudlow claims that may lose money and
wealth in one way, but we gain it back many time over when the
rebuilding is done. Kudlow and Krugman have quite an affinity for
deficits. Krugman sees debt as a sponge to absorb excess saving. Kudlow
see debt as a short term nuisance that we can dispel
by *maximizing* growth. One would think that such famous economists
would realize that competition does work to achieve the goal
of *optimum* growth based on time preference, but this is not the case.

While these economists have expressed their belief in writing, they
could do more. If the destruction of assets leads to increased
prosperity, then they should teach this principle by example. Kudlow and
Krugman could, for instance, help build the economy by demolishing their
own private homes. This would have the immediate effect of stimulating
demand for demolition experts, and the longer term affect of stimulating
the demand for construction workers. They can create additional wealth
by financing the reconstruction of their homes through debt. By
borrowing funds, they draw idle resources into use and stimulate
financial activity. Of course, they would both initially lose wealth in
one way. But if their thinking is sound, they will gain it back many
times over as they rebuild.

The truth is that their beliefs are fallacious. Bastiat demonstrated the
absurdity of destructive creation in his original explanation of the
opportunity costs from repairing broken windows.

Kudlow is quite clear about his intentions. He wants to grow the economy
to finance the war. As Kudlow told some students, "The trick here is to
grow the economy and let the economic growth raise the revenue for the
war effort"2 . Kudlow also praises the Reagan Administration for growing
the economy to fund national defense. Here Kudlow's attempts to give
economic advice cease completely. His argument here is not that
capitalism needs a shot in the arm. It is that resources should be
redirected towards ends that he sees fit. Kudlow is a war hawk who,
obviously, cannot fund this or any war personally. He instead favors
using the state to tax others to fund what he wants, but cannot afford.
He seems to think that his values matter more than any other's. Why
should anyone else agree with this?

Kudlow tarnishes the image of laissez faire economics by
parading *his* faulty reasoning and *his* claims that his wants should
reign supreme as a pro-market stance. Unfortunately, it is sometimes
necessary to defend capitalism from alleged advocates of liberty, who
employ false dogmas in pursuit of their own militaristic desires.

[**[Capitalism neither requires nor promotes]{.mark} [imperialist
expansion]{.mark}**. Capitalism did not create imperialism or warfare.
Warlike societies predate societies with secure private property. [The
idea]{.mark} that inequity or underspending give rise to militarism
**[lacks any rational basis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Imperialistic
tendencies exist due to ethnic and nationalistic bigotries, and the want
for power. [**[Prosperity depends upon]{.mark}** our **[ability
to prevent destructive acts]{.mark}**. The dogma of destructive creation
fails as a silver lining to the cloud of warfare. **[Destructive acts
entail]{.mark} real [costs that diminish]{.mark} available
[opportunities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The idea that we need to find work for idle hands in capitalism at best
leads to a kind of Sisyphus economy where unproductive industries garner
subsidies from productive people. At worst, it serves as a supporting
argument for war. The more recent versions of the false charges against
capitalism do nothing to invalidate two simple facts. [**[Capitalism
generates prosperity]{.mark} by creating new products**. **[War inflicts
poverty]{.mark} by destroying existing wealth**. There is no sound
reason to think otherwise.]{.underline}

[Kaleckian **reformulation**]{.underline}

As Kalecki asked of the numerator (P = I + CC = c.I): "Does it mean that
[profits]{.underline} in a given period [determine capitalists'
**consumption** and **investment**]{.underline}, [or the **reverse** of
this]{.underline}?" Kalecki's answer to his own rhetorical question
brooks no causal ambiguity. The [determination]{.underline} "[depends on
which]{.underline} of these items [is **directly** subject to the
**decisions of capitalists**]{.underline}. Now, it is clear that
[capitalists]{.underline} may decide to consume and to invest ... but
they [cannot decide to earn]{.underline} more. It is, therefore, their
[**investment** and **consumption** decisions which **determine
profits**]{.underline}, and not vice versa." (1971, pp. 78-9)14 That is,
the [causality runs from spending by capitalists]{.underline} on
Department I's output plus their own consumption of part of Department
II's output [to their profits]{.underline} P. In a nutshell,
[capitalists **get** what they **spend**]{.underline}.15

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

As the following will reinforce, the critical variables are investment I
and the capital stock C, and C is principally investment spending
accumulated. The rate at which the capital stock has grown to the end of
period t is the rate of accumulation a′. If it is reasonable to think
that both capitalists' consumption and retirement move in reasonably
constant proportion to I and C, respectively, then (with numbers added
for illustration16): It follows that, given some starting rate p′,17 the
trend in the rate of profit p″ is fundamentally a function of the rate
of change of investment i″ = δI/I (the numerator) and the rate of
capital accumulation a′ = δC/C (the denominator). The denominator is
clearly consequent upon (that is, a catch-up function of) the rate of
change of investment i″. Therefore, it is possible to simplify the terms
in which we consider the direction of the profit rate and, ergo, the
logical burden Marx's theory must bear, according to: Plainly, this is
just to say that the profit rate will rise if the rate of change of
investment i″ is greater than the rate of accumulation a′, and vice
versa. Another way of saying this is that investment is growing
proportionately by more than is the stock of capital. In the limiting
case, in which capitalists do not consume and none of the capital stock
retires, the rate of profit and the rate of accumulation will be
equivalent.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

**[Marx's errors]{.underline}**

The [logical burden of]{.underline} the [above expression
shows]{.underline} why [Marx's theory **breaks down**
irretrievably]{.underline}. Keep in mind that the burden arises from
Kalecki's insight --- which, in turn, his reading of Marx and Rosa
Luxemburg had influenced18 --- that [profits are **just** what
capitalists themselves **spend**]{.underline}. [Once we understand
the]{.underline} imperious [necessity that the denominator]{.underline}
of the rate of profit [must be understood to be a **function** of its
numerator]{.underline}, [and that the numerator is a **function solely**
of capitalists' **spending decisions**]{.underline}, [then two
determinations]{.underline} must also [follow as a matter of
**logical**]{.underline} (indeed arithmetic)
**[necessity]{.underline}**. [A third is that theories of a **declining
profit** rate due to working-class underconsumption **fail** because
workers' consumption does **not figure** in the **calculation** at
all]{.underline}.

The first determination is that [both]{.underline} major
[counter-tendencies]{.underline} that [Marx proposed will **not
materialise**]{.underline}. [Capitalists might squeeze]{.underline}
necessary [labour and wages to]{.underline} the point of working class
"[immiseration]{.underline}" --- to the point that workers "were able to
live on air"19 --- [but it would **not increase** the rate of profit one
iota]{.underline}, [as odd as that may seem]{.underline}. To be sure,
[squeezing wages will reduce]{.underline} aggregate [value
added]{.underline} because wage-goods spending will fall. Hence, the
size of Department II will shrink. For the same reason that
[underconsumption theories **fail**]{.underline}, it is apparent that [a
**wage-squeeze** or a **profits-squeeze** will not **directly** affect
profits or the **accumulated capital** stock]{.underline} (the two
constituents of the profit rate). [Falling or rising wages
will]{.underline}, other effects remaining equal, [change the wage and
profit]{.underline} shares of national income, [but they will **not
directly affect the profit rate**]{.underline}

Moreover, because the two constituents of the profit rate are
manifestations of the value of the material output of Department I, both
the numerator and the denominator of the profit rate will devalue at the
same rate; that is, in line with Department I's increased productivity
in a given year. Why? Just as Marx valued labour power over time in
accordance with productivity changes in Department II,20 we should value
profits according to productivity changes in Department I. Just as we
devalue the capital stock denominator in this way at year end, including
that part added by investment over the year, we must devalue that same
part in the numerator. It is about revaluing what capitalists have
already spent over the year according to what that spending is worth in
dollars current at the end of the year. If our yardstick is spending to
maintain production capacity then, in Kaleckian terms, the relative
value of this year's required investment spending, and the profits
consequent upon it, should be reckoned to have fallen with the
cheapening of constant capital.

Again, as odd as it may seem, [if capitalists' consumption
maintains]{.underline} its [**proportionality** with
investment]{.underline} spending, the [profit rate will be
**unaffected** by **devaluation**]{.underline}.21 Accounting for the
role of devaluation q, which affects numerator and denominator
separately but not the rate of profit per se, we now have (with numbers
illustrating a 2.5% productivity gain):

The second necessary consequence of Kalecki's insight is far more
devastating for Marx's theory. In chapter 15 of Capital Volume III, Marx
offered a nuanced account of the law, including its own internal
contradictions. Nonetheless, he underscored its theoretical importance
by reprising formulations made famous in the Preface to A Contribution
to the Critique of Political Economy (1859) concerning the fettering of
capital by immanent barriers of its own making. He also articulated why
Smith and Ricardo had strained their minds to find a natural not
economic explanation of their own conclusions that the profit rate
should decline over time. It is worth reading a long selection to
establish how the various parts fit and, therefore, how we should judge
the law (1894 \[1981\], p. 349-51):

[A fall in the profit rate]{.underline}, [and accelerated
accumulation]{.underline}, [are simply **different expressions** of the
same process]{.underline}, in so far as [both express the development of
**productivity**]{.underline}. Accumulation in turn accelerates the fall
in the profit rate, insofar as it involves the concentration of workers
on a large scale and hence a higher composition of capital... Thus
economists like Ricardo, who take the capitalist mode of production as
an absolute, feel here that this mode of production creates a barrier
for itself and seek the source of this barrier not in production but
rather in nature (in the theory of rent). The important thing in their
horror at the falling rate of profit is the feeling that the capitalist
mode of production comes up against a barrier to the development of the
productive forces which has nothing to do with the production of wealth
as such; but this characteristic barrier in fact testifies to the
restrictiveness and the solely historical and transitory character of
the capitalist mode of production; it bears witness that this is not an
absolute mode of production for the production of wealth but actually
comes into conflict at a certain stage with the latter's further
development... It should never be forgotten that the production of this
surplus-value --- and the transformation of a portion of it back into
capital, or accumulation, forms an integral part of surplus-value
production --- is the immediate purpose and the determining motive of
capitalist production.22

The first point to note is that, implicit here is the antediluvian ---
that is Ricardian and pre-Kaleckian, pre-Keynesian --- idea that
causality runs from profit to capital-spending and accumulation
("transformation of a portion of it back into capital"). The idea is
also implicit in the circuits-of-capital schema of capital's
self-expansion (M---C---M' = \[M+m\]) that Marx introduced in the first
volume of Capital. While the realisation of profit and its conversion
back into capital via investment seems a plausible explanation at the
level of the individual capitalist firm, the explanation does not hold
at an economy-wide or macroeconomic level. The level of spending or
effective demand causes production to be what is and not vice versa. It
is true that Marx was aware of effective demand. He rejected "Say's
Law"23, which, in effect, maintained that production naturally
engendered its own purchases. Say claimed that this precluded
generalised overproduction. Marx explained, immediately after the
passage quoted above, that a "second act", of realisation of surplus
value through sales, must complete the process started in the "first
act", of production. The two acts were not harmonious but were separate
in theory and in time and space (1894 \[1981\], pp. 351-2). However, he
did think that aggregate profits preceded aggregate investment causally.

Nevertheless, the [true lesson]{.underline} of the revolution in
economic thought in the 1930s [was not about "overproduction" or even
over-capacity]{.underline}. It was that **[production
adjusts]{.underline}** --- [via price changes]{.underline}, [inventory
management, market-testing and on-demand production etc]{.underline} ---
[to the prior cause of effective demand]{.underline} or spending (and,
therefore, to its prior causes). [When effective demand
drops]{.underline}, [production follows]{.underline}, [and
**recessions** and **depressions** ensue]{.underline}. It is of utmost
importance that we do not answer tangential questions in this respect.
Of course, production seems primary, in the sense that it accounts for
employment and the distribution of labour across the economy. Of course,
realisation can seem to be primary, in the sense that unrealised profits
are not really profits at all. Yet both are subordinate to effective
demand, as far as we are answering the macroeconomic question. Crudely,
what changes in response to what?

[Detaching profits from]{.underline} their [**causal dependence** on
**investment** spending **obfuscates** the arithmetical imperative
contained in the earlier expression for the trend in the profit
rate]{.underline}, namely:

To illuminate the point, consider the following three stylised figures
that try to capture the kinds of ebbs and flows of investment,
accumulation and profits observable in real economies (see Appendix).
The figures apply the key equations and illustrative numbers above. They
demonstrate that [sufficiently **strong investment**
spending]{.underline} (and capitalists' consumption) [**lifts** the
**mass** of profits and can **lift** the **rate** of
profit]{.underline}. [If investment spending is such that]{.underline}
its [rate of growth exceeds]{.underline} the rate of
[accumulation]{.underline}, [an **increase** in the rate of profit
**must occur by necessity**]{.underline}. These conclusions encapsulate
the second necessary consequence of Kalecki's insight.24

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

Figure 1 represents the "zero case". Capitalists "live on air", the
capital stock lives on indefatigably and productivity growth is absent.
It is useful insofar as it illustrates two important things. The first
is that the rate of accumulation and the rate of profit are identical in
this scenario. Both are direct and uncomplicated functions of the rate
of change in investment. To be precise, all are direct, uncomplicated
functions of the raw numbers for investment spending in the simple table
that sits behind the figure. Investment spending is causal. The second
is that the figure illustrates without clutter the essential conclusion
that the rate of change of investment intersects the rate of
accumulation at its lowest and highest points. As it passes through the
lowest points on its way up, it drags the rate of accumulation (and the
rate of profit here) up with it. As it passes through the highest points
on the way down, it drags the rate of accumulation down with it. In
short, relatively stronger rates of investment increase the rates of
accumulation and profit and vice versa. \[\[FIGURE ONE OMITTED\]\]
Figure 2 is probably closest to Marx's case, since he does not (in fact,
cannot) deal with annual rates of retirement because the regrettable
one-year assumption forces the whole stock to retire (depreciate, turn
over) in one year. He does consider capitalists' consumption, however,
and its effect here is to separate the rate of profit from the rate of
accumulation and shift it upwards by 10% of its rate in Figure 1. The
rate of accumulation remains unaffected by productivity-induced
devaluation of 2.5% per period, as this affects both its numerator δC =
I and denominator C in equal proportion; that is, a revaluation of
0.975% per period. Again, the critical conclusion is evident. As it
passes through the lowest points of the rate of accumulation on its way
up, the rate of change of investment drags the rate of accumulation up
with it and vice versa. The rate of profit follows a corresponding path,
peaking when the rate of investment intersects the rate of accumulation
at its highest and vice versa. Note the obvious relationship between the
rates of accumulation and profit: increasing rates of accumulation
correspond to increasing rates of profit and decreasing rates of
accumulation correspond to decreasing rates of profit. \[\[FIGURE TWO
OMITTED\]\] Figure 3 introduces retirement. This is a necessary
corollary of chapter 4 and other additions by Engels to the Volume III
that tried to clarify matters, even if not to expunge the
single-turnover one-year expository device.25 Because it reduces the
value of the capital stock by 7.5% per period, it shifts up the rate of
profit such that it sits above the rate of accumulation by about 19% of
its rate. This is the number in the earlier numerical illustration. The
figure exhibits the same relationships between peaks, troughs, contours
and offsetting productivity effects as did Figures 1 and 2. Again,
critically for the present task, increasing rates of accumulation
correspond to increasing rates of profit and decreasing rates of
accumulation correspond to decreasing rates of profit. \[\[FIGURE THREE

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

Conclusions

This [brief assessment]{.underline}, [on]{.underline} its own terms, of
Marx's "[Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit]{.underline}"
has [reached **unambiguous conclusions**]{.underline}. [The **profit
rate will not tend to fall** in consequence of what Marx called
**accelerating accumulation**]{.underline}. Rather, [periods of
**investment growth** that **increase** the rate of accumulation cause
the **rate of profit to increase**]{.underline}. Those that dampen the
rate of accumulation cause the profit rate to decline. These
[conclusions are **contrary** to]{.underline} the [essence of Marx's
theory]{.underline} and the fate of capitalism that --- despite all
manner of qualifications and caveats we might try to make --- [he
evidently **extrapolated**]{.underline} from it.

What other conclusions might we come to? One, surely, is that our
attention should focus on the determinants --- the real causes --- of
[capitalist investment spending]{.underline}. It
[determines]{.underline} the [trends in **accumulation** and is the
**main contributor** to profitability and the rate of
profit]{.underline}. [The rate of profit]{.underline}, therefore, while
remaining an important indicator, [must lose much of the singular causal
force often attributed to it. The rate of profit is a
**symptom**]{.underline} and, perhaps, a secondary but not first-order
cause. It is hardly a revelation then that Kalecki thought that the
"theory of investment decisions" constituted "the central problem of the
political economy of capitalism" and was "the central pièce de
résistance of economics" (1971, pp. 148, 165). Those familiar with
Kalecki might find the repetition of this conclusion somewhat tedious.
Maybe, but that does not make it any less relevant.

The first is [[the \"population bomb]{.underline}]{.mark},\" which (as
we saw in chapter 7) defused itself. When countries get richer and
better educated, they pass through what demographers call the
demographic transition.- First, death rates decline as nutrition and
health improve. This does swell the population, but that is hardly
something to bewail: as Johan Norberg notes, it happens not because
people in poor countries start breeding like rabbits but because they
stop dying like flies. In any case, the increase [[is]{.underline}
**[temporary]{.underline}**]{.mark}: birth rates peak and then decline,
for at least two reasons. Parents [[no longer breed]{.underline}]{.mark}
large broods [as **[insurance]{.mark}**]{.underline} against some of
their children dying, and women, when they become better educated,
[[marry later and delay]{.underline}]{.mark} having
[[children]{.underline}]{.mark}. Figure 10-1 shows that the world
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark} growth rate
**[[peaked]{.underline}]{.mark}** at 2.1 percent a year in 1962, fell to
1.2 percent by 2010, [[and will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably
**[[fall]{.underline}]{.mark}** to less than 0.5 percent by 2050 and
[be]{.underline} close [[**to zero**]{.mark} around 2070]{.underline},
when the population is projected to level off and then decline.
Fertility rates have fallen most noticeably in developed regions like
Europe and Japan, but they can suddenly collapse, often to
demographers\' surprise, in other parts of the world. Despite the
widespread belief that Muslim societies are resistant to the social
changes that have transformed the West and will be indefinitely rocked
by youthquakes, Muslim countries have seen a 40 percent decline in
fertility over the past three decades, including a 70 percent drop in
Iran and 60 percent drops in Bangladesh and in seven Arab countries.

Peak Population

World population will likely peak at 9.8 billion people at around 2080
and fall to 9.5 billion by 2100 in the medium-fertility scenario
calculated by demographer Wolfgang Lutz and his colleagues at the
International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.19 Alternatively,
[[assuming]{.mark} rapid [economic **growth**]{.mark}, **technological**
advancement, and rising levels of educational attainment for both
sexes]{.underline}---all factors that tend to lower fertility---Lutz
projects that [[world population will]{.mark} more likely [peak
at]{.mark} about [**8.9 billion** by **2060**]{.mark}]{.underline} and

Because population is a compounding phenomenon, over the long term
(i.e., decades to centuries), small differences in net population
dynamics make large differences in total population size. Illustrative
in this regard are speculative long-term projections from the UN
Population Division (UN DESA 2004) through 2300 (figure 1a). They
produce three variants of population projections, of which the medium
variant is most often cited. The medium variant includes an assumption
that over the long-term, individual countries will equilibrate in the
postdemographic transition at the "replacement rate," at which a woman
over the course of her lifetime will have, on average, 2.1 children. The
medium variant leads to a prediction that the world population will peak
around 9.1 billion people shortly after 2100 and then float at
approximately 9 billion ever after. The [[high]{.mark}
[variant]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}assumes a long-term total
fertility rate of 2.6 children per woman, which leads to 36.4 billion
people by 2300, an estimate that [[**greatly** exceeds population levels
supportable]{.underline}]{.mark} by current agricultural patterns (Sayre
2008). The most optimistic projection is the low variant, which assumes
a total fertility rate of 1.6 children per woman, a level in keeping
with the current fertility rates in developed economies but on a
worldwide scale. Remarkably, were such fertility patterns sustained,
they would lead to a world of 2.3 billion (not 9 billion--10 billion) by
2300. Policy-relevant shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)--- developed
by O'Neill and colleagues (2017) based on scenarios of health,
education, and international migration through 2100 (figure 2b)---show
how startling divergent twenty-first-century demographic pathways could
be. [A world where]{.underline} international migration, **[[trade, and
development]{.underline}]{.mark}** assistance **[[are
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}** could [[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} a
world of [[**12 billion** by century's end]{.underline}]{.mark} (SSP 3;
KC and Lutz 2017). The best-case scenario reflects [ongoing
investments]{.underline} in health, education, and cities, which could
[lead to]{.underline} a twenty-second-century Earth with a
**[[population below 7 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., a
population smaller than today; SSP 1). The end of poverty. The world
today is much wealthier than it ever was. As with population growth,
reconstructions by Maddison (2007) have suggested that for most of
recorded history, economic growth was so slow as to be barely
noticeable, on order of 0.1% per year. It was only with the Industrial
Revolution that economies began to grow significantly. Developing
countries---such as the United Kingdom in the early nineteenth century,
the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, or
China more recently---have economies that can grow at 5%--8% annually
before maturing to still-significant but lower growth rates (1%--3% per
annum; De Long 1988). The tremendous wealth generated in the Great
Acceleration has not been evenly shared across countries or within them.
Much has been written about disproportionate gains made by the richest
people and countries, increasing levels of inequality (e.g., Piketty
2014). Less remarked on but also important is how economic growth has
benefited people at the lowest end of the income scale, both individuals
and nations as a whole (table 1). In 1981, more than half of the
population of the developing world lived on less than \$1.25 a day; by
2010, that proportion had fallen to 21%, despite a 59% increase in the
developing world's population (Olinto et  al. 2013). Chandy and Gertz
(2011) estimated that increased economic growth in middle- and
low-income countries over the last three decades has helped some 721
million people escape extreme poverty (approximately 24 million fewer
poor per year). In East Asia and Pacific countries, the rate of rural
poverty declined by threefold between 1990 and 2008 (Cruz et al. 2015).
Recent gains in poverty alleviation appear to be driven by people
migrating from the countryside to towns and cities or by urban areas
expanding to incorporate nearby rural areas (Angel 2012, Turok and
McGranahan 2013). Most economists see rural-to-urban migrations driven
by economic opportunity and other benefits of urbanization (Glaeser
2011)---so-called pull factors---whereas others note that some
migrations are also driven by antagonistic landuse policies and climate
change (Davis 2007)---that is, push factors. The economic effects of
people living closer together in urban agglomerations are ubiquitous.
Per capita incomes increase dramatically with urbanization of society
(Glaeser 2011, Turok and McGranahan 2013). "Spillover" economic effects
can help rural incomes as well by providing markets for goods and direct
transmittances of cash (Christiaensen et  al. 2013). Inducements to
inhabit urban agglomerations seem to prevail even over living
conditions, because many poor rural-to-urban migrants find themselves
living in slums in terrible conditions, often in peri-urban areas. As we
noted above, poor living conditions were commonplace in European and
North American cities well into the twentieth century, until the
provision of clean water, urban sanitation, and decent housing made
possible gains in health and welfare, setting the stage for more
sustainable urban forms. Even though the World Bank recently moved the
poverty threshold from \$1.25 to \$1.90 per person per day (Ferreira
2015), the global poverty rate still may have fallen to single digits by
2015, and predictions suggest that by 2030, the percentage of the
extremely poor could be between 3%--7% globally (figure 1b; Cruz et  al.
2015). Although over 700 million people globally are still poor,
including many living in sub-Saharan Africa, the international adoption
of sustainable development goal 1 ("End poverty in all forms
everywhere") suggests a realistic aspiration to what only a few decades
before seemed an impossible ambition: the eradication of extreme
poverty. The growth of cities. Cities are changing, too (figure 1c).
Between 1950 and 1990, the number of people living in urban areas
increased from approximately 746 million to 2.29 billion; between 1990
and 2014, urban populations grew again by another 1.6 billion people, an
addition equal to the entire world population of 1900. Urbanization over
the next 35 years is expected to add another 2.5 billion people to the
world's towns and cities (UN DESA 2014). Longer-term projections range
from 55% to 90% of all people living in towns and cities by 2100 (Jiang
and O'Neill 2017). All regions of the world have urbanized over the last
100 years (note the progression of data with respect to the x-axis in
figure 3). Most developed countries currently have urbanization levels
that exceed 70%, including Western Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United
States. Latin America and the Caribbean is the most urbanized region in
the world, with urbanization percentages of 70%--80%. Although the
United Nations does not have a single, standard definition of an urban
place and allows each country to use its own definition (UN DESA 2014),
the prevailing pattern is clear. It is important to note that most
definitions include not only large megacities and heavily built-up
places (e.g., Manhattan and central Tokyo) but also smaller towns,
including suburbs, which house many more people worldwide than
skyscraper-filled central business districts (Christiaensen et al.
2013). As is apparent to the more than 50% of humanity that lives within
them, urban agglomerations have expanded outward at unprecedented rates
over the last 100 years, with the areas of land urbanized growing even
faster than the urban populations (Angel 2012). Most experts believe
this trend will continue. Güneralp and Seto (2013) predicted that
between 2000 and 2030, global urban land cover will grow by 200% while
urban populations will grow by some 70%. However, collectively, urban
areas occupy only a relatively small fraction of the Earth's surface.
Examining different measures of urban extent, Seto and colleagues (2011)
estimated that urban areas covered 0.2%--2.7% of global land area in
2000 and evaluated growth scenarios that suggest a maximum extent of
5.9% by 2030. Urbanization and biodiversity conservation in the
Anthropocene Now, we turn from these extraordinary trends to
observations about how urbanization affects all of them, using the IPAT
framework to organize our discussion in terms of population, affluence
(and therefore, consumption), and technology (or more broadly,
ideation). In economics and sociology, urbanization is often described
as yet another characteristic of development, along with technological
innovation, industrialization, trade liberalization, and good
governance, all of which contribute to rising per capita incomes (e.g.,
Jones 2013). Environmentalists have traditionally seen urbanization as
mainly about the movement of rural people to urban areas, driving
increases in consumption and therefore concerns about environmental
impact (e.g., Rees and Wackernagel 1996). We argue that both of these
views have distracted conservationists from the critical effects of
urbanization on the choices people make about how to live. Urbanization
as a driver of change in population, consumption, and technology.
Although advances in medical science and hygiene are generally accepted
as decisive for the declines in mortality during the demographic
transition, [[the causes for the "fertility
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}" have been long debated by demographers
(Dyson 2010). The most credible recent explanations [[seem to be
**tightly interwoven** with urbanization]{.underline}]{.mark} (Mace
2008, Martine et  al. 2013). As we discussed above, when people live in
cities, they have a [[better chance to find
**employment**]{.underline}]{.mark} in diversified economies, which
allow individuals to better exploit their particular skills and
predilections. Simultaneously, [urban economies tend to be
larger]{.mark} because of agglomeration effects, which [[create
**more**, **better-paying**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and diverse
[[jobs]{.underline}]{.mark} than in rural economies. Increased
opportunities for work [[lead to greater autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially for women, who [[gain]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[control
over their reproductive lives]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part through
access to contraception, family planning, and education (Lutz and Qiang
2002) and in part through the changing cultural norms and power dynamics
that result [[from women holding more income]{.underline}]{.mark} of
their own (McDonald P 2000). Because urban families experience higher
costs for rent, food, and other necessities, without the offsetting
benefits that greater labor from children provides in agricultural
economies, [[**incentives** for large families
**diminish**]{.underline}]{.mark} as people move to town (Notestein
1945). Also, in cities, people have better access to medical care, which
means that life expectancies improve, which further implies that couples
have less reason to hedge against infant mortality with additional
births (Mace 2008). Because urban kids will likely become urban adults
working in skilled, nonagricultural jobs, [[education is
**incentivized**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Maralani 2008). The effects are
clear in the data: Plotting World Bank--compiled statistics on mortality
and fertility rates against urbanization shows precipitous declines,
with mortality followed by fertility (figure 3a, 3b). The net result is
that population growth rates have also declined for all regions of the
world except sub-Saharan Africa (figure 3c).

sense**]{.underline}.

Were the planetary boundaries authors suggesting that the Africans
should wait to use more fertilizer until the Chinese had reduced their
use? Not exactly. But in calling for cutting global fertilizer levels by
75 percent, the authors were clearly framing fertilizer as a problem of
too much (e.g. in places like China), while [leaving the
problem]{.underline} of too little fertilizer (e.g., Rwanda) [**out** of
the framework]{.underline}.

The [failure to account for]{.underline} different [environments points
to the **main problem** with the planetary boundaries
framework]{.underline}: [it only measures]{.underline} environmental
[change as **negative**]{.underline} \-- as [progression toward supposed
**biophysical boundaries**]{.underline} \-- [and **never as
positive**]{.underline}, either for humans (e.g., more food) or
environments (e.g., higher yields resulting in less deforestation).

Early this month, the Breakthrough Institute published a report based on
[**a thorough review** of the lit]{.underline}erature that found
[**little scientific support** for the planetary boundaries
hypothesis]{.underline}. We [benefited from]{.underline} an informal
[review of each section by **leading scientific
specialists**]{.underline} from the relevant fields. Thoughtful stories
on the debate were filed by The Economist, Scientific American, and the
Wall Street Journal. By late last week, United Nations negotiators had
stripped out all references to planetary boundaries from the Rio+20
text.

#### Circular economy [solves]{.underline}.

The role of the [circular economy]{.underline} in [getting]{.underline}
us [back **within planetary boundaries**]{.underline} ([and **keeping us
there**]{.underline})

For policymakers, business leaders, and researchers, the planetary
boundary framework acts as a situational analysis for the state of the
planet upon which business, society, and the natural world depend. It
sets the scale of the challenge without professing to propose specific
solutions. We need an economic framework which addresses the root causes
of each planetary pressure point and plots a positive way forward.

[A **circular** economy **eliminates** waste and pollution]{.underline},
[**circulates** products and materials at their **highest
value**,]{.underline} [and **regenerates** nature by
design]{.underline}. [Accelerating]{.underline} its
[transition]{.underline} can not only help to [bring us back **within**
the **biophysical limits** of our planet and **keep us
there**]{.underline}, but build economic value, deliver material cost
savings, and create jobs at the same time.

[Eliminate waste and pollution]{.underline}

If waste is the most visual representation of the linear economy --
evident everywhere from construction to clothing and electronics to
interiors -- its elimination is one of the central tenets of the
circular economy. Waste itself is an inherently anthropogenic concept,
supercharged by the birth of planned obsolescence in order to stimulate
demand and ensure continual production. [Solving the waste
crisis]{.underline}, which both directly and indirectly [contributes to
cascading]{.underline} planetary boundary breaches, cannot be achieved
through surface-level strategies of reduction or recycling alone.
Rather, we must [reframe our entire approach]{.underline} so that [in a
**circular economy**]{.underline}, as in nature, [waste simply **does
not exist**]{.underline}.

When we take a material definition of waste, plastic is often our first
thought; 75% of all plastic ever produced becomes waste. From packaging
to parts, these ubiquitous compounds are used by almost every sector on
earth. The planetary boundaries case for action on plastics is
unequivocal -- we must stop it from polluting our atmosphere, poisoning
our land systems, and entering our oceans. That means stemming the tide
at source. While it is essential that any plastics we do produce are
reused, recycled, or composted, it is even more important that
businesses prioritise models of design and delivery which eradicate the
use of virgin fossil fuel-based plastic from the outset.

[Transitioning to a circular economy]{.underline} which [**eliminates
all** problematic and unnecessary **plastic** involves harnessing the
same enthusiasm for design as brought it to the fore in the first
place]{.underline}, without losing any of its functions. [Designing
alternatives]{.underline} -- such as solid shampoo bars, toothpaste
tablets, and compostable food casings -- [can **drastically reduce** the
pressure on]{.underline} multiple [planetary boundaries]{.underline} at
once. Every time a business removes the need for virgin plastic within
or around a product or service, it helps prevent the leakage of
environmental pollutants -- including those that are ozone-depleting --
protect biodiversity, reduce climate change-causing GHG emissions, relax
anthropogenic pressure on ocean acidification, keep microplastics out of
freshwater systems, and stop the release of further airborne pollutants
into the atmosphere. That's a lot of boundaries.

Compellingly, a [circular economy]{.underline} for plastic
[offers]{.underline} businesses [**strong economic** and **social
benefits** too]{.underline}: not only by [reducing packaging and
transportation costs]{.underline}, but also by [encouraging **investment
to flow**]{.underline} [into new areas of **upstream
innovation**]{.underline}. By 2040, a circular economy for plastic has
the potential to generate savings of USD 200 billion per year, and
create 700,000 net additional jobs. Similar waste elimination strategies
can be implemented and scaled to the benefit of multiple planetary
boundaries across all sectors and industries, from construction to
computing.

Circulate products and materials

The [second principle of a circular economy involves keeping materials
and products]{.underline} in use [at their **highest
value**]{.underline}. The more times a product or service is used, the
fewer of them are needed. By making much better use of the embodied
energy and labour, and the intrinsic value of the materials in a product
or service -- applicable to everything from headphones to high-chairs,
washing machines to watches, and lighting to laptops -- a [circular
economy **prevents**]{.underline} the [need for further **material
extraction**]{.underline}. In doing so, it not only [reduces pressure on
from **individual** planetary boundaries]{.underline} -- land system
change, biosphere integrity, freshwater, novel entities, climate change,
and more -- but [**makes space** for the earth's natural systems to
**recover** and **regenerate** across the planetary system]{.underline}.

### Sustainability\-\--AT: Endless Growth\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Capitalism is not dependent on endless growth\-\--prefer empirical data [analysis]{.underline}.

**Saunders '16** \[Harry Saunders, international expert of energy
efficiency and consumption, previously worked at the U.S. Department of
commerce and the International Energy Agency. "Does Capitalism Require
Endless Growth? Marx and Malthus Reconsidered." June 21 2016

//vo\]

[Before considering whether these various challenges to advanced
capitalist economies portend their collapse, it is important to note
what none of these analyses suggest, which is that capitalism's
unquenchable demand for growth has run up against fundamental
biophysical limits. If anything, these **[analyses suggest the
opposite]{.mark}**: that the **[limits to continuing growth]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} [capitalist]{.mark} [economies]{.mark} **[are social]{.mark}
or technological, [not biophysical]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Brynjolfsson
and McAfee, and Piketty, through technically different mechanisms,
ultimately raise concerns that center around the immiseration of labor.
Whether due to technological change, growing returns to capital, or
both, all three centrally focus on declining wages and employment as the
central challenge that threatens robust and equitable growth in
capitalist economies.

Mason, conversely, projects that technological change threatens returns
to capital. The commodification of everything --- material goods,
knowledge, and information --- ultimately brings with it an end to
profits and hence both capital accumulation and capital
reinvestment.^11^ Gordon, meanwhile, observes that there is simply no
further techno-economic revolution that can replicate the one-time boost
in economic productivity that comes with the shift from agrarian to
industrial economies.^12^ [If there is a common theme in these
challenges to capitalist economies it is that all find their way, to one
degree or another, back to Marx, not Malthus. **[The long-term
challenge]{.mark} for capitalist economies**, these analyses suggest**,
[is too little growth]{.mark}, [not too
much]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The headwinds facing advanced industrial economies --- stagnant growth
and rising inequality --- tell us something about the prospects for low-
or zero-growth capitalist economies. [Gordon's analysis suggests that
**[industrialized economies]{.mark}** in relatively short order
**[achieve a "satisficing" level of]{.mark}** household
**[consumption]{.mark}**. **[Once that]{.mark} level [is
achieved]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} once societies have [built]{.mark} out
the [basic infrastructure]{.mark} of modernity --- cities, roads,
electrical grids, water and sewage systems, and the like --- **the
[growth rates]{.mark}** characterized by the early stages **[of
industrialization]{.mark} [cannot be sustained]{.mark}** by the
knowledge and service sectors that increasingly dominate post-industrial
societies.]{.underline}

[World Bank data clearly show this. **[Economic growth rates decline as
countries become richer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Growth in GDP per capita
in OECD countries slowed from an average of about 3 percent per year in
the period 1961--1985 to about half of that in the period
1986--2014.^13^ Gordon's analysis is supported not only by the long-term
slowing of growth in industrialized economies but also by saturating
household consumption in those economies. According to the World Bank,
OECD growth in real household consumption per capita (consumption of
both goods and services) has shown steady decline each decade from
around 3 percent per year in the 1970s to around 1 percent per year
since 2000.^14^

Brynjolfsson and McAfee, and Piketty, suggest that declining returns to
households from their labor will drive worsening inequality and stagnant
or declining wages. But that does not imply a declining material
standard of living. The same technology gains and capital mobility that
have eroded the power of labor in developed world labor markets have
also persistently reduced the real prices of goods and services, making
them ever more affordable.

[[Even as]{.mark} nominal [wage]{.mark} growth has slowed or
[stagnated]{.mark} in the US and other advanced developed economies,
**[households are able to buy more]{.mark} with less of their
incomes**]{.underline}. This is because the cost of goods and services
has grown even more anemically, inflation nearly disappearing in these
countries over the same time period, meaning wages have grown in real
terms. OECD data show that real wages OECD-wide have grown by about 1
percent per year between 2000 and 2014, including real growth in the
United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.^15^ Growth in
the Scandinavian economies (Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland) has
exceeded this.^16^

This is true even at the bottom of the income distribution. [Virtually
all low-income homes in the United States today boast a refrigerator,
modern heating and cooling, and electricity]{.underline}. Large
majorities have dishwashers, washers and dryers, computers, cable
television, and large-screen displays. [[Consumer goods]{.mark} and
services once considered luxuries in the United States and other
developed countries **[are]{.mark} today [widely available]{.mark}** and
utilized by all citizens]{.underline}. That is mostly because home
appliances and other goods today cost a small fraction, measured in the
work time necessary to purchase them, of what they did thirty years
ago.^17,18^

Of course, rising economic inequality raises a range of concerns beyond
those related to access to goods and services. Higher rates of
inequality may threaten social mobility, social cohesion, and perhaps
even democratic governance. Even so, inequality appears to decline as
nations industrialize and become wealthier. In rich Scandinavian
countries (Sweden, Denmark), inequality has essentially halved since
World War II.^19^ Declines recently are less impressive in the United
States, United Kingdom, and other parts of Europe^20^, but, nonetheless,
inequality remains reliably lower than in most developing economies^21^,
where aggressive but still [**[insufficient capital formation]{.mark}**
in the presence of large labor forces tends to **[result in]{.mark}
higher levels of [inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Moreover, [increased **capital [mobility]{.mark} [has driven declining
inequality]{.mark}** between countries, even as it may be worsening
inequality within them. Thanks to global trade and international supply
chains, firms have become increasingly able to locate production
facilities in the developing world, where labor with the requisite
skills can be employed at lower wages.]{.underline}

As might be expected, labor in industrialized countries is not happy
with this turn of events. But the result has been a long-term
convergence of wages between producing and consuming countries,
declining inequality globally, and a dramatic decline in absolute levels
of poverty. The ILO reports that between 2000 and 2011, real average
wages approximately doubled in Asia.^22^ In Latin America, the
Caribbean, and Africa they also rose substantially, well above the
developed world average^23^, while in developed economies they increased
by only about 5 percent, far below the world average^24^, leading to
what leading ILO observer Patrick Belser has dubbed "the great
convergence"^25^ --- a dynamic that was incidentally predicted many
decades ago on theoretical grounds by famed economist Paul
Samuelson.^26^ Meanwhile, [according to the World Bank, the global share
of people living on less than \$1.90 per day (the World Bank definition
of extreme poverty) fell from 44 percent in 1981 to 13 percent in
2012.27]{.underline}

Taken together, then, the dynamics transforming the global economy,
while not without challenges, paint an interesting picture of slowing
growth, converging global incomes, falling cost, and saturating demand
for goods and services. Should these dynamics hold[, [it is not hard to
imagine]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [future in]{.mark} [which]{.mark} **the
[global economy]{.mark} [gravitates toward]{.mark}** a
**[prosperous]{.mark} [and equitable]{.mark} [zero-growth
economy]{.mark}** [placing]{.mark} relatively **[modest demands on the
biocapacity]{.mark}** [of the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. But getting
from here to there will require a number of further conditions.

#### Capitalism is [flexible]{.underline} and [adapts]{.underline} to become more sustainable.

**Pirie '17** \[Dr. Madsen Pirie, PhD in Philosophy from University of
St Andrews, co-founder and president of the Adam Smith Institute. "Why
Marx was wrong about capitalism" 2017
https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/thinkpieces/why-marx-was-wrong-about-capitalism
//vo\]

He predicted that capitalism would drive down wages to survival level
before its final denouement.  In fact [**[as economies]{.mark}** became
more **[advance]{.mark}**d, both **[wages and living standards
rose]{.mark}** to levels not even dreamt of in Marx\'s day, and
[this]{.mark} seems to have **[lowered]{.mark} the [pressure for
revolutionary change]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Marx was]{.mark} also wrong about something more fundamental.  He was
**[wrong about change]{.mark}**.]{.underline}  I don\'t just mean that
he was wrong about the changes that would come about; more fundamentally
he was wrong about how change takes place.  He took the Hegelian model
of change.

To Hegel change comes about through staccato triangles.  A state of
affairs nurtures its opposite, and from the violent clash between the
two a new state of affairs emerges.  Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis. 
Violence is at the core of it, and hence Marx\'s commitment to
revoution.

But Marx was a contemporary of Darwin.  He had read Darwin\'s \"Origin
of Species\" and admired Darwin\'s account of the origins of humankind. 
He failed, however, to spot the significance of Darwin\'s theory of
change and to incorporate it into his own programme.

Darwin advanced a gradual mechanism of change in which small differences
gradually come to dominate over time.  It is evolutionary, not
revolutionary, and is a much more accurate description of how change
usually happens in human societies than was Hegel\'s account.  Indeed,
Darwin was right and Hegel was wrong.  This means that Marx was also
wrong, wrong about change, and wrong about how capitalism would develop.

[The point is that **[capitalism]{.mark} changes and
[evolves]{.mark}**.  It has been through many transformations.  **[The
capitalism that Marx]{.mark} [thought would collapse]{.mark}** under its
own contradictions **[is not the capitalism of today]{.mark}** - the one
this motion refers to.]{.underline}

[In the material world organisms evolve.  They respond to crises and
they change.  A similar thing happens with our **[social
practices]{.mark}**.  They **evolve and [adapt]{.mark}** to new
circumstances.]{.underline}

[Capitalism has faced many crises, and each time it has evolved and
changed.  Each time **a new form of [capitalism]{.mark}** has **emerged
to solve the problems its predecessor faced**.]{.underline}  This is how
human beings progress.  We solve our problems by adapting our practices.

[Capitalism certainly faced a crisis in 2008, but it is still with us,
as yet uncollapsed**.  It [is evolving]{.mark}** and responding
**[to]{.mark} the [changes that are needed]{.mark}**]{.underline} and,
as before, when the dust of crisis has settled, [it will be a new
version of capitalism that [go]{.mark}es [on to]{.mark}
[generate]{.mark} more [wealth]{.mark} [and]{.mark} to expand the
[opportunities]{.mark} open to humankind.]{.underline}

That new version of capitalism that emerges will have to be one which
somehow manages to keep at arm\'s length the politicians wanting to fix
its outcomes for political advantage.  Greedy bankers can only take
reckless risks if politicians make it cheap for them to do so by turning
on the taps of credit and money.  Politicians like booms and bubbles
because they help them to win elections and office, so procedures must
be found that limit their ability to do this.  Those whose greed is for
power are no less deadly than those who greed is for gain, and both need
rules to circumscribe their scope for action.

I wish to make a further point: that [**[capitalism will
survive]{.mark}** because **[it is the only]{.mark} valid [way]{.mark}
we have found [that works]{.mark} in practice [to create wealth]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [opportunities]{.mark}** it brings.]{.underline}

[Marx was wrong about another important thing.  He subscribed to the
labour theory of value, believing that the value of a thing arises from
the labour put into producing it.  Wrong.  Value is based on demand.  If
no-one wants a thing, then no matter how much labour went into producing
it, it is valueless.]{.underline}

[We all value things differently, which is why trade takes
place]{.underline}.  We trade because we each put greater value on what
the other person has than on what we are offering in exchange.  [We both
gain more value when we trade, and that\'s how we create
wealth.]{.underline}

[We produce in order to trade and to create wealth, and we invest in
order to produce]{.underline}.  That\'s in essence what capitalism is,
and it works - certainly better than anything else that has been tried. 
And it works more humanely, too.

Yes, [capitalism grows more complicated and more ambitious as it
evolves, but **its principles remain**]{.underline}.  [**[Capitalism
will]{.mark}** survive its current crisis.  It will **be tweaked and
modified but it will [not collapse]{.mark}**, because **[nothing]{.mark}
has ever been found that [can replace it or]{.mark}** do what it does,
or **[bring the advantages and benefits]{.mark}** [it
brings.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[It]{.mark} has brought the resources that have [lifted]{.mark} most of
[humankind]{.mark} [above]{.mark} subsistence and [starvation]{.mark},
that have enabled us to **[conquer diseases]{.mark}**, to fund education
and social services, to [enable]{.mark} people to engage in artistic and
cultural activities and **to enrich their lives with [previously
undreamt-of opportunities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Sustainability\-\--AT: EROI/Ahmed/Murphy/Bardi\-\--1AR

#### Ahmed, Murphy, and Bardi are wrong\-\--none of their evidence supports their claims.

**Berman '23** \[Art; May 27; Professor at University of Houston,
Geologist; "Does Renewable Energy Have a Higher EROI Than Fossil
Fuels?",
https://www.artberman.com/blog/does-renewable-energy-have-a-higher-eroi-than-fossil-fuels/\]

[I evaluated]{.underline} the 2022 [**EROI** paper by]{.underline} David
J. **[Murphy]{.underline}** and colleagues that [**Ahmed** and
**Bardi**]{.underline} cited as the source of their good news about the
superior EROI of renewables.

This statement from that [paper]{.underline} [was a huge **red
flag**]{.underline} for me.

"Even if crude oil were measured to have an EROI of 1000 or more at the
point of extraction, the corresponding EROI at the point of use, using
global average data for the energy "cost" of the process chain, would
still only be a maximum of 8.7."

This means that the supply-chain energy costs for refining and product
distribution create a permanent penalty that prevents oil from reaching
an EROI of more than 8.7. [It]{.underline} furthermore
[implies]{.underline} that [refining must be]{.underline} a
[**marginally profitable** business at best which it is
**not**]{.underline}.

It [suggests]{.underline} that [all]{.underline} previous [EROI work
over]{.underline} [the last **two decades** was wrong]{.underline}. The
reason it was wrong, according to the paper's authors, is that previous
workers failed to account for the full supply chain of energy
investments from extraction to point-of-use. [That]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} simply **[untrue]{.underline}**. The
[approach]{.underline} [has]{.underline} [been used at least since
**2009 by Hall**]{.underline} et al.

By the authors' own admission, oil is the most important fuel for the
global economy. An oil EROI of 4.2, however, would place it below what
most researchers consider to be the minimum EROI threshold needed to
support society as noted by Euan Mearns.

"It is assumed that ERoEI \>5 to 7 is required for modern society to
function. This marks the edge of The Net Energy Cliff.

Figure 2. The Net Energy Cliff shows how with declining ERoEI society
must commit ever larger amounts of available energy to energy gathering
activities. Source: Mearns (2016).

In this renewable energy Hail Mary, the **[authors]{.underline}** reveal
their fundamental **[fail]{.underline}**ure [to comprehend]{.underline}
the [significance of their EROI subject]{.underline}:

"This means that oil delivers less net energy to society for each unit
invested in extraction, refining, and delivery than PV or wind. The
transition to electric vehicles, according to these results, will
actually increase."

[Society]{.underline} does not [function]{.underline} and survive
[on]{.underline} the per-unit net energy to society but on [the
full-system net energy delivered to society]{.underline}. This is like
saying that I can solve my personal financial problems by delivering
newspapers because the per-unit returns are so high. The net income from
the paper route is so small, however, that it wouldn't even help with
the monthly escrow payment on my mortgage.

The bottom line is that [Murphy et al have **not
presented**]{.underline} the **[data]{.underline}** [to support their
conclusion that renewables]{.underline} in fact [have a higher EROI than
oil.]{.underline}

Lack of Transparency

The biggest problem with net energy and [EROI research]{.underline} is
that it [is almost **impossible to accurately identify** all or even
most of the energy inputs.]{.underline} This is compounded by different
workers using diverse and sometimes incompatible methods to determine
the values needed.

The stated purpose of David Murphy and colleagues' paper was to clarify
the confusion. This is an admirable and much-needed effort. [They did
not]{.underline}, however, [provide]{.underline} the [necessary data to
support their findings]{.underline}.

There is [**no** a **table or graph**]{.underline} in the report that
allows the reader to see the input and output data and resulting net
energy and EROI values for all the relevant energy sources.

[There is a table that provides a comparison for fossil]{.underline}
(thermal) [fuels]{.underline} shown below as Table 2 (Murphy's Table 2)
[but it does not show the energy data.]{.underline} Instead these
"investments" are listed as a percentage of total for each technology.
Among other things, that [makes it **impossible to
validate**]{.underline} the **[EROI calculations]{.underline}**. There
is no similar table for renewable energy sources.

I have highlighted the percentage values for oil to show the source of
what I believe to be the problem

Nearly 9% of the total post-extraction costs for oil are for refining.
Yet most of the energy for refining comes from the crude oil and refined
products used in the refinery. It is, in effect, co-generated. That
doesn't negate the energy investment needed to operate the refinery but
it is not a cost to society as indicated in the table.

Table 2. Thermal fuel supply chain investment table. Source: Murphy et
al (2022) Table 2.

Figure 3 shows how this accounting error affects the EROI calculation.
It is modified from Hagens (2010) Figure 5.

The first part of the figure shows 10 megajoules (MJ) of energy coming
into the refinery ("Processing) and 1 MJ being added from society. The
resulting net energy to produce 10 MJ of gasoline is 8 and the EROI is
5.

In the second part of Figure 3, the identical situation is presented
except the 1 MJ of refining investment is "co-generated" from the 10 MJ
coming from "Extraction" and not charged to society. The net energy is 8
MJ, the same as in the first case, but the EROI is 9!

Figure 3. Two ways of depicting the EROI of gasoline production from
crude oil. Source: Modified from Hagens (2010).

That erases much of the good renewable news reported by Ahmed and Bardi.

In Table 3, I have used Murphy et al's oil transmission and distribution
investments (their Table 2) converted from percent to energy units
following the format of their Table 1. I divided their 8.9% for refining
investment by 3 to account for the co-generation described above (it is
probably much lower). The [resulting oil EROI is 18]{.underline}. [That
completely **removes**]{.underline} the [good news from **Ahmed's** and
**Bardi's** **proclamations** of "mission accomplished" and **restores
oil EROI** to the **consensus** range for the last two
decades]{.underline}.

using refinery "co-generation" of energy. Source: Labyrinth Consulting
Services, Inc.

I am troubled by [**lack of transparency** in the Murphy et al
paper]{.underline} particularly their [failure]{.underline} [to show
input and output energy data]{.underline}. I suppose [it may be found
among the 73 references]{.underline} [but that is well beyond the
ordinary standards of transparent communication]{.underline}. I located
a link for supplementary data that only applied to fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, critical inputs for this data were from the ecoinvent
database which is unavailable without a paid subscription.

I confess that I do not have much confidence that Murphy et al have
accounted for the energy cost for resource extraction or renewable unit
production because those investments are not shown in their Table 1 or
Table 2.

[Another source of confusion is Murphy et al's use of a **life-cycle
efficiency factor**. This multiplies the energy output of renewable
sources by a factor of 3.3 to adjust for their longer-term energy
payout.]{.underline}

The efficiency factor for fossil fuels is close to 1 so it does not
provide any boost. I am not qualified to dispute the use of this
life-cycle term except to say that without it, wind and solar would have
EROI values much lower than those for fossil energy.

[Nor do Murphy et al discuss the transmission and **distribution cost of
electricity** from renewable energy]{.underline}. You have only to
compare your next electricity bill rate to the spot price for your
region. In the United States, the retail price is 30 to 50% higher. That
makes any percentage in Table 2 above (Murphy et al's Table 2) seem
trivial---including the 8.9% refining penalty that doomed oil to an EROI
of 4.2! In fact, De Santis et al (2017) note tha

"The cost of electrical transmission per delivered MWh can be up to
eight times higher than for hydrogen, about eleven times higher than for
natural gas, and twenty to fifty times higher than for liquid fuels.

[Murphy et al do **not address** the **effect of intermittency** on the
net energy supply that society needs to function. They tell us that
technology will find a way and perhaps it will but that does not change
the present upon which their study is based.]{.underline}

#### Indigenous participation in capitalism can further sovereignty and create a mutually beneficial relationship, ACFN proves.

two ways I have outlined if it was not also demanding rights and
resources from the liberal democratic settler-state. Or stated in the
obverse, ACFN's [**participation in capitalism** is what enables it to
**further its sovereignty**]{.underline}. I make this argument because
[**[refusing to sign]{.mark} a funding [agreement]{.mark}** [with
the]{.mark} federal [government]{.mark} and fighting a media-savvy,
resource-intensive campaign against environmental destruction
**[require]{.mark} significant economic
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[**resources** [the]{.mark} vast
majority of **[First Nations]{.mark}** in Canada
**[lack]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is through Acden and the generally
high employment level of its members that ACFN is afforded the
opportunity to reject federal money and fund environmental fights.

[A final point I want to make is regarding the relationship between
participation in capitalism and Indigenous worldviews]{.underline}.
Despite the case of ACFN I have outlined above, I am not willing to
suggest that First Nations can participate in capitalism in ways that
are entirely consistent with their worldviews, as much as I wish this
were the case. On the other hand, as I have noted previously, I do think
the degree to which participation in capitalism involves embracing
capitalist ideals can vary, and I have noted above just a couple of
simple ways ACFN's participation in capitalism through Acden has been
tempered by their values. [I know many more **[examples of]{.mark}**
this type of **[tempered participation]{.mark} in capitalism** by
Indigenous (and other) peoples **[could]{.mark} [be found
worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, I do not think that
First Nations should capitulate to capitalism's worst characteristics or
entirely abandon their values to embrace capitalistic ones. I strongly
believe [**[there is room to adapt]{.mark} participation** in capitalism
so that it can be done in **ways [closer to Indigenous
worldviews]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But ultimately, no matter how much
capitalism can be tempered by Indigenous values, I recognize that
Indigenous participation in capitalism will likely require a compromise
of Indigenous worldviews. Which leads me to this question: how can I,
someone sensitive to the significance of worldview, recommend that
Indigenous peoples adapt their worldviews to those of the colonizer?

My answer has two components. First, because I strongly believe
**[capitalism]{.underline}** in Canada **[is inevitable]{.underline}**,
and that rejecting it is futile. Second, because I think it is
reasonable to expect that worldviews adapt, compromise, and evolve in
the face of changing realities, whether they be colonial realities or
otherwise. Very few people (if any) manage to go through life making
choices entirely consistent with their worldviews, just as societies'
worldviews change and adapt with time. This, tragically, has to be all
the more true in the fight against colonialism; to quote Franz Fanon.
For me, then, [**[Indigenous participation]{.mark}** in capitalism
should involve both an attempt to **[temper]{.mark} capitalism's most
egregious [conflicts]{.mark}** with Indigenous values]{.underline}, even
as it requires a compromising or adaptation of Indigenous worldviews.

This article has defended an assumption regarding First Nations'
participation in capitalism, by using Bruyneel's idea of Indigenous
peoples working within a third space to both demand "rights and
resources from the liberal democratic settler-state," and challenge "the
imposition of colonial rule." While there are no doubt cases of First
Nations refusing to participate in capitalism, and other cases of First
Nations embracing capitalism wholeheartedly to the detriment of their
values and worldviews, [Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation provides an
example of how]{.underline} [Indigenous participation in capitalism
**[need not be inconsistent]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **furthered
[sovereignty]{.mark}**, nor require complete abandonment of Indigenous
values.]{.underline}

My contention is that [**[participation]{.mark} in capitalism [should
be]{.mark}** seen as **[a valid option]{.mark} for First
Nations**]{.underline}. [**Realistic [alternatives]{.mark}** to
participation in capitalism **[are]{.mark}** at best
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and may be nonexistent. Rather,
[investment should be made in adapting capitalism to fit Indigenous
values]{.underline}, even as Indigenous worldviews may need to adapt in
the face of capitalist realities. In order to facilitate this process,
[settler entities looking to form economic relationships with First
Nations should be sensitive to conflicts in worldview between settlers
[and]{.mark} Indigenous peoples]{.underline}---including settler
corporations and Indigenous shareholders, partners, employees, etc.
[Settler entities should be willing to adapt and negotiate with these
tensions in mind. An economic relationship negotiated and developed with
worldview differences in mind should result in a relationship that is
better for all parties. Ultimately, **First Nations' participation in
capitalism [can result in sovereignty]{.mark} [being furthered]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[colonialism]{.mark} [being resisted]{.mark}** in ways
ACFN has only begun to demonstrate]{.underline}.

and]{.underline} the only plausible economic
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} besides rents
[[flow]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to **private

revenues." [[This is a **narrow view**]{.mark} of renewables' benefits,
not only [because it is]{.mark} so [US-specific]{.mark}, but also
because it [views "economic benefits" **separately** from]{.mark} the
**[ecological effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} of different types of
electricity generation.

[The advantage to humanity of [renewables]{.mark} expansion -- that
**[even under capitalism]{.mark}** it [creates]{.mark} the [potential
for closing]{.mark} down **[coal]{.mark}**]{.underline}- **[[and
gas]{.underline}]{.mark}**-fired power stations [[and]{.mark} thereby
improves the chances of [avert]{.mark}ing **disastrous [climate

still very, **very important**]{.underline}.

[[Huber writes]{.mark} that neoliberal [electricity
restructuring]{.mark} has [led to an **alliance** between big
tech]{.mark} firms [and]{.mark} other investors and [renewable]{.mark}
energy producer[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, to avoid relying on US
utilities; that markets in renewable energy certificates are used for
greenwashing corporate reputations; that naive environmentalists "have
become unwitting allies of the Googles and Berkshire Hathaways of this
world," because they "fail to recognize their renewable advocacy often
enables the further neoliberalization of electricity"; and that the
left, "seduced by climate rhetoric", has "become the unwitting ally of
this program."

[This trail of [guilt by association **leads
nowhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, there is corporate tension between
big tech and the US utilities: the former sees decentralized electricity
generation as a way to weaken the latter. [[Big tech]{.mark} has [used
**new tech**]{.mark}nologies [in this way **before**]{.mark}, for
example in the online advertising, transport, and postal industries. But
[the lesson is not that the internet]{.mark}, the post, or urban
transport [are **bad in and of themselves**]{.mark}; rather, it is that
**society** in general and the labor movement specifically must champion
public and collective forms of **ownership and control**]{.underline}.

One does not have to go further than New York to see how this is done:
the Public Power NY campaign, whose efforts recently led to the adoption
of the Build Public Renewables Act, has won endorsements from unions
representing more than 1 million members in the state.18

[[Beyond the US]{.mark}'s borders, we can hear **[heated

about how to [combine social justice]{.mark} goals [with]{.mark} the
**urgent [decarbonization]{.mark}** of energy systems]{.underline}. One
starting-point for learning about these is a draft framing document,
published last year by Trade Unions for Energy Democracy. [Policies that

#### They can coexist!

[[Socialism]{.mark} [and capitalism]{.mark}: can]{.underline} they [be
**[mutually compatible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or are they like matter
and antimatter, unable to coexist in the same place? In the heated
climate of today's political discourse, voices from the left condemn
capitalism for all the ills of humankind. Voices from the right assert
all things liberal are socialist, which is Cuban communism in disguise.
For terms that generate such strong emotional reaction, one would expect
them to be fairly well understood. But ask any acquaintance to define
what they mean, then stand by for garbled non sequiturs and vague
obfuscations. And why not? Both have multitudes of meanings covering a
lot of territory. What interests me today is how people fill them with
opprobrium to be lobbed into the public debate.

Vague, but strongly felt prejudices about capitalism and socialism come
in part from popularization of ideas and phrases taken from works by
people such as Weber and Schumpeter. Weber's 1905 "The Protestant Ethic
and the Spirit of Capitalism," was skimmed by political science and
sociology majors for what was likely to be on the final. It contributed
to the myth that Calvinism equated wealth accumulation with evidence of
divine election thus driving the development of modern Western style
capitalism. Schumpeter's 1942 "Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"
contributed to popular magazine articles and pamphlets warning about the
Red Danger. Students didn't actually read Schumpeter -- they read about
him. Echoes of each float around in the political ether infecting
conversations of people who have no idea where they came from.

For the record: [capitalism and democracy are not the same
thing]{.underline}; [socialism and communism are not the same
thing]{.underline}; [capitalism and socialism
**[coexist]{.mark}**]{.underline}, more or less harmoniously, [[in
**every Western**]{.mark} **[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Forms of
capitalism **[profitably]{.mark}** exist [in]{.mark}
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[claiming]{.underline}** [to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [**Marx** loving **communists**]{.underline}.
Saying that doesn't seem to penetrate very far into the understanding of
those who prefer to believe otherwise.

[For some]{.underline} people, [capitalism is demonic
oppression]{.underline} of the people, [and needs to]{.underline}
[go]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} [asked]{.underline} [if]{.underline}
it means they [would do away with private property]{.underline}, private
[enterprise]{.underline}, mutual [fund]{.underline} retirement
[accounts]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[entrepreneurship]{.underline}, [they're **aghast** at the very idea of
it]{.underline}. What seems to enrage them is the amoral monopolistic
power of giant corporations able to invade and control every aspect of
life. Add to it excessive inequality of income and wealth, and i[t's not
capitalism they dislike, it's the **injustice** of
conditions]{.underline} present in our democratic society's private
enterprise economy. They want to change the conditions, not do away with
private enterprise.\
To other people, [[liberal ideology **leads to
socialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which may not be communism but heads
in that direction. It [puts private enterprise in]{.underline}
straitjackets of heavy handed [regulation]{.underline}, and **[[over
taxation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that]{.underline} [strips
owners]{.underline} and managers [of]{.underline} the freedom to make
decisions they think best for [business]{.underline}. It
[[subjects]{.underline}]{.mark} [[investors]{.mark}, savers,
[and]{.mark} [entrepreneurs]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [**whims** of
**greedy workers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [government bureaucrats, and
social do-gooders]{.underline} who have no skin in the game. It
appropriates hard earned wealth to provide benefits for those unwilling
to provide for themselves.

There is truth in both views, but only partial truth. Italian social
philosopher Giorgio Agamben notes that [capitalism]{.underline}, per se,
is amoral and [has no purpose other than for private hands]{.underline}
to manipulate the flow of money in pursuit of profit. Borrowing from
Walter Benjamin, he calls it a religion without dogma. [Business
people]{.underline}, and businesses large and small, may be
[committed]{.underline} [to socially worthwhile]{.underline}
[purposes]{.underline}, but [capitalism]{.underline}, the ill defined
skeleton within which they exist, [is concerned only with maximizing
return to invested parties]{.underline}. It has [no moral interest in
what a business is or how it's run]{.underline}. Things falling under
the equally ill defined umbrella of socialism do have a moral purpose.
Advocates believe they will make quality of life better, more just, and
more economically rewarding for more people, especially those who are on
the lower rungs of society. They intend to open doors to self
sufficiency that have been closed to many. Within the context of
American progressivism, the fundamental rights of private property and
private enterprise are never in doubt, but the amorality of capitalism
requires that it be regulated to protect the rights and well being of
people, the environment, and the long term health of the economy.

Libertarian advocates of capitalism often talk about the free market.
They believe free market capitalism, operating with very little
(preferably no) government oversight, can rely on competitive markets to
sort out inefficiencies and provide the best products and services at
the lowest cost to rational willing buyers. It's an article of faith
that ignores reality: markets are easily manipulated to hobble
competition, and consumers are not rational. Moreover, the myth of free
market capitalism is uncomfortable accommodating conflicting public
interests that jeopardize profit potential.

Therefore, [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
[always]{.mark}]{.underline} and [everywhere [**intervened** on behalf
of]{.mark} the **[public]{.mark} good** [to
regulate]{.mark}]{.underline} how [[markets]{.underline}]{.mark} are
structured and business is conducted. [Greater]{.underline}
[complexities]{.underline} in markets, with increasing conflicts between
public and private interests, [require]{.underline} a [more]{.underline}
comprehensive menu of [regulation]{.underline}. It also means some
[services]{.underline} [are]{.underline} better [provided by
government]{.underline}, or through public/private partnerships, because
they don't lend themselves to privatization that endangers some and
excludes others to the detriment of the public good. Conservative
restraint is one thing, but obsessing about it becoming out of control
socialism is rational only as a tool to incite fear for political gain.

The principle of "[[leaving no one behind]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[[necessitates]{.underline}]{.mark} the equitable and uniform
[[implementation of]{.underline}]{.mark} United Nations (UN)
**[[sustainable development goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** (SDGs).
Globally, [socioeconomic resources are pre-dominantly allocated
following the Pareto principle, where a minority of high-income
economies]{.underline} defined by World Bank Country and Lending Groups
[control a substantial portion of the global wealth]{.underline}.
Efforts to achieve SDGs should therefore prioritize addressing this
imbalance, guided by Liebig's law of the minimum. However,
[ameliorating]{.underline} the [disparities]{.underline} in the pursuit
of SDGs [presents a considerable challenge]{.underline}, especially [in
[polar regions]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the Arctic, the
Antarctic, and the Third Pole (the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding high
mountain areas). Polar regions, covering approximately 20.1% (or \~300 ×
106 km2) of the global land area and 16.7% (or \~600 × 106 km2) of the
ocean area, are [recognized as]{.underline} [outposts]{.underline} (or
early warning systems) [of climate change]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [these regions]{.underline} serve as biodiversity reservoirs,
water towers, and storage of climate driving gases. They also [[provide
a diverse array of ecosystem services]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
**[[critical for global sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
For example, the [[fisheries in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Antarctic [[contribute to achieving zero hunger]{.underline}]{.mark}
(SDG2). The sustainable management of these fisheries is [[of great
value]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[to conserving]{.mark} and sustainably
using [global marine resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (SDG14)9. The Third
Pole, with its total annual runoff exceeding 650 × 109 m3, is vital for
guaranteeing water security for downstream residents (SDG6)10.
Furthermore, the protection and maintenance of high mountain vegetation
and biodiversity are fundamental for the global protection and
restoration of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG15).

However, [[sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark} in polar regions
has been [[largely overlooked]{.underline}]{.mark} in the formulation of
global SDGs. A mere 0.75% of the SDG-focused studies during 2015--2022
have considered polar regions, as indicated in our literature reviews
(Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, the marginalization of polar
regions is also reflected in other international reports, such as the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Environment Outlook
(GEO) series12. Beginning with GEO-213, [[polar
regions]{.underline}]{.mark} have often been [[treated as **side
issues**]{.underline}]{.mark}, highlighting their consistent
underrepresentation in global environmental governance systems. In
addition, there are currently no specific SDG indicators for the Arctic
or Antarctic regions. Although mountain areas have garnered more
attention than their polar counterparts, only 3 out of the 248 SDG
indicators are associated with mountain regions14. This
[[neglect]{.underline}]{.mark} of SDGs in polar regions is mainly [[due
to the misapprehension that]{.mark} sustainable [development]{.mark} in
these [areas is **economically marginal**]{.mark} and would **contribute
minimally** to global SDG efforts, a belief stemming from their sparse
populations and geographical remoteness.]{.underline}

[Polar regions]{.underline}, as interconnected biophysical entities
critical to planetary climate regulation, [require governance models
based on transnational collaboration and shared
stewardship]{.underline}---principles central to SDG 17. However,
[current]{.underline} global environmental governance mechanisms often
prioritize territorially bounded concerns over transboundary ecological
interdependence. [[Existing frameworks lack]{.underline}]{.mark}
institutional [[pathways to]{.underline}]{.mark} engage polar regions
equitably in [[resource mobilization, knowledge co-creation, or
tech]{.mark}nology [transfer]{.mark}, [despite]{.mark} their
**disproportionate [climate-regulating functions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Therefore, [the [marginalization of these systems]{.mark} not only
[reflects]{.mark} **ecological oversight** but also a broader [shortfall
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[operationalizing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
cross-sectoral partnerships and **[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
coherence [advocated by the SDG agenda]{.underline}.

In this study, we highlight the critical role of polar regions in global
sustainable development in a teleconnection perspective using an online
expert survey and bibliometric analysis. We posit that [polar regions
are the fragile boundaries of the planet's climate commons]{.underline}
because these regions are associated with 12 out of the 16 climate
tipping elements identified thus far16,17. Furthermore, people living in
these regions face heightened exposure to escalated risks attributable
to dramatic climate change. These risks include thawing permafrost,
reduced shore protection owing to the melting of sea ice and increased
river flows, thereby leading to substantial climigration events.
However, the involvement of these communities in advancing the SDGs has
been left behind.

Therefore, [[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[fragilities]{.mark} in
environmental, social, and economic sustainability, polar regions could
be the "weakest link" in achieving global SDGs]{.underline}, akin to the
"shortest stave" of Liebig's barrel analogy. [[Neglecting these regions
in the SDG framework could precipitate an unforeseen "**tragedy of the
commons**".]{.underline}]{.mark} More importantly, once polar regions
are 'left behind', it might seriously impair the Earth's sustainable
future through the cascading effects of interconnected tipping
elements21, thereby jeopardizing efforts to maintain planetary
boundaries within a safe operating space22. If the right actions are
implemented through global partnerships (SDG17), they would not only
strengthen the sustainable development in polar regions, but also
further enable the achievement of global SDGs.

// K Nahm

A colleague of mine recently put forth an interesting hypothesis about
the sustainability of human life: Because the capitalist economic model
relies on continuous growth, he argued, it conflicts with the reality
that the Earth has finite resources.

[There's been [no lack of criticism about
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} over the course of history --- [that
it's exploitative and alienating, and it erodes human
rights]{.underline}. [Anti-capitalist ideas, movements and trends have
been a mainstay [on the world stage]{.mark}]{.underline} since the
mid-19th century. Marxist schools of thought exploded in the early 20th
century and, ever since, various forms of anti-capitalist ideology have
constituted a major theme of the zeitgeist, often flying in the face of
the globalist capitalist model that has simultaneously dominated the
world economy. A 2019 poll found that 70 percent of U.S. millennials
said they were likely to break from capitalist beliefs and vote for a
socialist candidate, and some speculate that presidential candidate
Elizabeth Warren torpedoed her 2020 campaign by her unwillingness to
identify as a socialist.

[[One area]{.mark} that [critics feel is]{.mark} the [most negatively
impacted]{.mark} by capitalism [is **the
environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1971, Marxist economist Ernest
Mandel wrote that capitalism posed a "growing threat" for the
environment, and, consequently "the survival of humanity."

Despite a third of Americans denying that human-caused climate change
exists, numerous reliable studies have proved otherwise. Far-left
politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders have proposed sweeping government
programs that would pump money into mitigating climate change, and it
seems inevitable that governments across the globe will need to step up
to lead if we are to make meaningful progress.

Given a preponderance of this scientific evidence, [it is hard to argue
against the reality of human-caused climate change. [However, the global
capitalist model is **not the problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the
contrary, I would argue that [[only by **leveraging the capitalist
structure** can we slow the effects of climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} No other economic model could come close to
the efficiency of capitalism's ruthless competitiveness in finding
effective solutions. It's simple economics. Here's how we do it:

It is absolutely true that the key barometer in a capitalist economy is
profit growth. Firms compete by increasing profits in order to survive,
and firms that don't grow profitability will ultimately perish.

But consider for a moment how the concept of profit gets interpreted.
Any college economics textbook would define profit as the surplus that
results from the value provided by goods and services as determined by
the free market minus the costs to produce and deliver such goods and
services. Of course, all costs must be accounted for to determine
profits. A firm cannot choose which costs to include and which to
exclude in its calculation if we are to have a standard of measurement.

Here's where the wrinkle comes in. Firms routinely and transparently
track their internal costs --- things like raw materials, laborand
utilities. But that same college economics textbook I mentioned above
also discusses the role of the government in correcting for what are
called externalities. If there are production costs that the firm is not
including --- essentially freeriding on the costs borne by others in
society--- the role of government is to develop a corrective mechanism
to ensure those external costs are internalized for the firms in
competition. In essence, the government must prevent firms from
freeriding.

Economists almost universally agree that [[externalities are a form of
market failure that the government is obligated to
correct]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Yes, the capitalist model prescribes a
specific set of roles that governments must play --- despite what
President Ronald Reagan told us.)

[[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[no more consequential
externalities today than]{.mark} the costs of polluting the earth,
especially the negative impacts of [releasing carbon]{.mark} into the
atmosphere as part of the value delivery system]{.underline} (sourcing,
production and distribution). Moreover, [[because]{.mark} carbon
[emissions are **measurable**, there is a]{.mark} **concrete way**
[of]{.mark} calculating and [assessing their costs]{.mark} related to
climate change]{.underline}. I think we would all agree that carbon
emissions qualify as an externality that all industrial firms have
failed to account for in their definition of profit over the past 200
years. But imagine a world in which we could effectively internalize
these costs through a universal governmental regulatory system such as a
universal carbon tax.

When taking the externality of pollution into account, a firm's profit
can be defined by the following equation:

Firm's profit = the entire surplus created and valued by consumers --
all costs needed to generate such value \[including the cost of carbon
emissions\]

All of a sudden, [the requirement for [capitalism]{.mark} to continually
grow [becomes a good thing]{.mark}. Why? [Because]{.mark} all else being
equal, [the way to]{.mark} continually [grow]{.mark} that [profit is by
**reducing** the costs of carbon emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In
order to maximize profits, [firms will **innovate and compete**]{.mark}
ruthlessly [to produce]{.mark} the same basket of goods and [services
with **less carbon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The smaller a firm's carbon
footprint, the more it profits. [**The power of the capitalist model**
is now unleashed]{.mark} to lower carbon emissions.]{.underline}

The thing about economics, of course, is that it works in theory -- but
putting it into practice is usually quite difficult. In this case, a
robust solution would require a nearly unprecedented global agreement
among nations in order to work.

But as I write in my book, "American Schism," liberal economic
principles stipulate unequivocally that government must assume an
essential portfolio of activities for the proper functioning of a
free-market economy. In simple terms, the government's role is
threefold:

To correct for market failures of a capitalistic free-market economy
such as externalities.

To invest, build and ensure uniform access to public goods like public
education, infrastructure, accurate information and job training.

To achieve better equity across the strata of society through
redistribution so that all can have access to liberty and freedom and
enjoy a basic ability to pursue happiness.

[[The "free market]{.mark}" is not libertarian --- it [necessitates a
regulatory structure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, minimizing regulation
should be a goal, but not at the expense of allowing market participants
to avoid bearing the damaging costs for which they must be held
accountable.

I fear that over time, [[capitalism has become **a scapegoat for our
societal woes**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} But [[rather than throwing the
baby out with the capitalist bathwater]{.mark}, [it is well within our
power to]{.mark} harness the very thing that makes capitalism great and
[**leverage it for a global good**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[The fate of the human race depends on it.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**full potential** of]{.mark} some of the **[most promising
tech]{.mark}nologies** that [modern science has]{.mark} yet
[invented]{.mark}]{.underline}.'125 This is, of course, some distance
away from the orthodox rendering of the contradiction: DAC is not a
motor of history about to smash through capital and drive humanity into
communism. We are here offered a lesson in media res of the primacy of
relations over forces. The historical sequence can then be crudely
summed up: after having called forth productive forces that wreck the
climate system, capitalist property relations are capturing another set
of forces that could contribute to its stabilisation, so that they
instead shore up those same relations and prolong the destruction to
which they are prone. Here is, with Theodor Adorno, 'a simple reminder
that the productive forces of technology are shackled and pushed in a
very specific direction, and that the prevailing conditions prevent
anything which might enable technology to break through this veil'.
Instead of 'unswerving negation' -- what negative emissions should be
all about -- we get one more way of 'sanctioning things as they are'.126

[Because capital has won the first round of [climate struggle]{.mark}s,
for three decades successfully fending off threats to business-as-usual,
we now face a second. It [concerns **not mitigation** solely, but
**removal**]{.mark} in addition]{.underline}. And precisely [because
'this enemy has not ceased to be victorious', it is well-positioned to
win again; [while]{.mark} the climate movement and [the left
**debate**]{.mark} **their [strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- Green
New Deal or degrowth, full automation or rewilding, civil disobedience
or sabotage -- [[capital produces one **fait accompli** after
another]{.mark}, soon likely to include a DAC plant coming to a roof or
field near you. **How can one keep up**]{.underline} to speed with this
machine[? The [first step must be to get on top of]{.mark} the
**[ideology]{.mark}** of it, and this means **refusing** to let any
negative emissions, imagined or real, ever **justify continued
'positive' ones**]{.underline}.127 There is an imminent danger that the
entrance of DAC into climate models will excuse inaction in the short
term, which is the one term that really matters; just like BECCS in the
years of Paris, DAC is about to become the next illusion of a safe
backstop. Decades hence, there will be a tech to sweep up the mess, so
let's create more of it in the meantime: there is no exaggerating the
irrationality of this gamble. Equally injudicious, not least from a
thermodynamic perspective, is the notion of running two infrastructures
in parallel -- one for spewing out CO2, another for washing it away --
rather than just remodelling the first.128 It would be resource
squandering on an epic scale.

[Winning the second round therefore demands a negation of its own,
breaking the lame aspirations for DAC as **waste
management**]{.underline}. Any headway in this round still rests on a
total end to fossil fuels. [The fact that there is too much CO2 in the
atmosphere means precisely that there can be **no more of it**. Perhaps
the **greatest folly** of banking on any substitute for ultra-radical
emissions cuts is the presupposition that the climate system can be
driven to a **state of collapse** and then wound back to the **status
quo ante**]{.underline}, much as one turns a radiator up and down: [but
this system is not linear]{.underline}. If the West Antarctic ice sheet
has drifted into the ocean or the Amazon rainforest desiccated, they
will not be instantly resurrected by subtracting 10 or 50 ppm. [The
[breakdown]{.mark} itself [**cannot** be put into **reverse**]{.mark}
**gear**]{.underline}.129 All the same, [three things remain
indisputable: such breakdown [becomes **likelier** the longer]{.mark} an
**excess of [CO2]{.mark}**[ stays]{.mark} in the atmosphere; [without
human intervention]{.mark}, it [will linger for millennia]{.mark};
**nothing** guarantees that fossil capital is **defeated** and emissions
**cease** this evening]{.underline}.

[That composite of [circumstances makes it **inadvisable** to write
off]{.mark} carbon dioxide [removal completely]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Buck argues in her landmark study After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy,
Repair, and Restoration, [any blanket [rejection]{.mark} now '[comes off
as an **aesthetic luxury**]{.mark}]{.underline}'.130 Suggesting that
this includes technologies such as DAC is sure to bring on a collective
allergic reaction in the environmentalist left. [A [common
objection]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Max Ajl, [[is]{.mark} that
'[tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} never socially innocent' but
[irrevocably 'bound to]{.mark} the **specific historical class war**
deploying that technology to a specific end' -- in other words, trying
to disentangle DAC from [its capitalist roots]{.mark} is a **misguided
folly**]{.underline}.131 [**[We must disagree]{.mark}**. If this were
the case, then we might as well forget about **renewable energy**
too]{.underline}. Its expansion in recent years has occurred in tandem
with continued expansion of fossil-fuel infrastructure and often de
facto worked as a supplement to -- even a greenwashing of --
business-as-usual. In the actually-existing capitalist world economy,
solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower often do not displace fossil
fuels but augment them.132 [Anyone faintly acquainted with the
production processes of these technologies is aware of the **massive
environmental** and **social costs involved**]{.underline}.133 [But
[this is **hardly a reason** to abandon]{.mark} the position that [what
is]{.mark} really [needed]{.mark} is precisely [to **negate
business-as-usual**]{.mark} by replacing fossil fuels with renewable
energy, albeit in a constrained, collectivised, more responsible
form]{.underline} -- it's only that capitalism appears unable to make
this happen. [[Renewable energy and DAC]{.mark} here [inhabit the
**same**]{.mark} **technological [battlespace]{.mark}**. [Fossil capital
deploys them to reproduce itself;]{.mark} the [task for any
**counterforce**]{.mark}**s** [is to]{.mark} instead [arrange
them]{.mark} so as [to maintain a **habitable

**Muiner 22** \[Timothy Muiner, May 23rd 2022. "Capitalism and Climate
Change: A Centrist Pragmatism Capable of Solving the Climate Crisis",
https://earth.org/capitalism-and-climate-change/\] 吳

The [conventional debate around the **root causes** and **solutions** to
the worsening climate crisis follows a **classic left-right divide**. On
one hand, the [left-leaning camp holds]{.mark} that [capitalism]{.mark}
and [i]{.mark}t[s]{.mark} unregulated rise]{.underline} over the decades
[are **[fully responsible]{.mark}** for the **unchecked greed** that got
us here [and]{.mark} that]{.underline} in order to save our planet,
[capitalism [must be **completely**]{.mark} **undone and
[replaced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [On the other hand, the right-leaning
camp believes that market forces alone can create the right
incentives]{.underline} and mobilise the necessary resources to achieve
rapid and deep cuts to global carbon emissions. Further along the
spectrum still, a more radically conservative approach believes that we
can continue business as usual and that the market will correct course
as it has done in the past. 

[Both camps suffer from a **multitude of shortcomings**]{.underline},
including short-termism and selfish dogmatism. [[If we]{.mark} were to
[adopt the socialist course of action]{.mark} to dissolve capitalism and
rebuild a **new economic system from scratch** focused on the climate,
[there wouldn't be]{.mark} **any [time left]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
actually put in place measures to **[drastically curtail]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, business leaders need to
recognise that government and corporations can and must work together to
create the necessary incentives and markets to protect our planet from
climate disaster, and acknowledge that a business-as-usual scenario
risks taking us over the edge of the cliff. The stark reality is that
[global [warming doesn't abide by]{.mark} **traditional [political
lines]{.mark}** and any combination of mitigating factors will not fall
neatly into any **ideological bucket**]{.underline}. 

Although the worst effects of climate change will manifest themselves on
civil society in the form of catastrophic habitat destruction and mass
migration, [the [root cause]{.mark} of the crisis [is]{.mark} a
**[practica]{.mark}l one** [and **not ideological**. We]{.mark} simply
[have to take **urgent action** to radically cut]{.mark} our carbon
[emissions and transition]{.mark} completely to a **low carbon economy**
built on renewable sources of energy and production]{.underline}. This
essay, therefore, calls for [a more [pragmatic '**third
way**']{.mark}]{.underline} to how we tackle the climate crisis, one
that [rejects **traditional left-right ideologies**]{.underline}. Akin
to the third way political stance that became popular in the late 1990s
amongst world leaders such as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton that attempted
to reconcile centre-left social policy with centre-right economic
policy, [today's climate woes [call for a **centrist pragmatism** that
combines]{.mark} the best use cases of [**government intervention**
and]{.mark} the **innovative might of [market
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

For further discussion on capitalism and climate change: you might also

Even as we shift to more renewable sources of energy, new technologies
might not be enough to compete with the dominance of fossil fuels.
[[State intervention]{.mark} will play a crucial role in
[subsidis]{.mark}ing nascent **new environmentally [sustainable
tech]{.mark}nologies** that will be economically unviable at first, but
at scale will **make the difference** in [remov]{.mark}ing [tens of
**billions of tons of emissions**]{.mark} from the atmosphere this
century]{.underline}. Similarly, governments around the world have been
attempting to impose a carbon tax, a price that emitters will have to
pay for every ton of carbon equivalent they release into the atmosphere,
forcing businesses and consumers to switch to new technologies that are
less carbon-intensive. [These kinds of policies will be instrumental in
driving **large scale shifts** to **less carbon-intensive activities**
and can [only]{.mark} be [implemented by]{.mark} a [large and effective
public sector.]{.mark}]{.underline} 

[Nowhere is this more apparent than in the **exponential growth** of the
**renewable energy sector**]{.underline} since the 1980s. [In
2010, solar and wind combined made up only 1.7% of global electricity
generation. By 2020, it had climbed to **8.7%**]{.underline} -- [**far
higher** than]{.underline} what had previously been
[predicted]{.underline} by mainstream energy models. [**Government
support** is widely credited for this growth and provided **essential
support** in the form of tax credits, subsidies and competitive auctions
for government mandates, all of which helped to **reduce costs** and
**accelerate deployment**]{.underline}. Radicals on the right would
therefore be remiss to discount the influence of an effective
government's role in stimulating the development of climate solutions. 

[According to the latest IPCC report, we are still **far off** from
**limiting global temperature rise** below 2C, let alone
1.5C]{.underline}, a target that was set in 2015 in the Paris Agreement
and was consolidated again at the recent COP26 UN climate summit. Given
these daunting delays, [it's more important than ever for the **forces
of innovation**, **entrepreneurship** and **private investments** to
build and scale the technology solutions that can get us to where we
need to be]{.underline}. During the month of April 2022 alone, over
USD\$2 billion were committed to startups in the carbon removal space, a
technology that removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere and stores it
where it can't re-enter the atmosphere for thousands of years. [A crop
of [entrepreneurs]{.mark} from around the world is [build]{.mark}ing the
[companies needed to get]{.mark} us [to **net zero** and]{.mark} then
**[negative emissions]{.mark}** globally, and attracting **private
market investors** to make their vision a reality]{.underline}. Earlier
this year, Stripe, McKinsey, Meta and Alphabet have joined forces to
invest close to one billion dollars into carbon removal startups over
the coming years in an effort to drastically reduce costs of development
and bring the market forward. As climate venture capitalist Tom Rand
states, [[we cannot]{.mark} possibly [transition]{.mark} off fossil
fuels [without]{.mark} the **financial might** and **entrepreneurial
talent** [market forces]{.mark} alone can unlock]{.underline}.

[[Proponents on **both sides**]{.mark} of the political divide [have
their part to play]{.mark} in helping humanity mitigate the risks of
**future climatic disasters**. But [whether]{.mark} the prevailing
system of [capitalism is to blame]{.mark}]{.underline} for the situation
we find ourselves in [[is **counterproductive** and]{.mark} **ultimately
[irrelevant]{.mark}** given that the [fire is **already
blazing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Individually, both sides are remarkably
ill-equipped to build the solutions to the climate crisis but combining
forces and ideas to form a centrist pragmatism, ambitious government
policies and innovative market forces will give us a chance. As new
technologies grow in popularity, expand their support from government
and attract private investments, it becomes easier still to leverage
further policy support and finance to achieve exponential growth. [These
are the dynamics that centrist pragmatism can achieve by bridging the
**political divide** and creating an **updated capitalism** that will
create a clean and sustainable environment for **generations to
come**]{.underline}.

[A [**more convincing critique** holds]{.mark} that it is wiser to
allocate renewable energy directly to the substitution of fossil fuels
than to something like [DAC]{.mark}, and so any installing of the latter
[is an **illogical, costly distraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.138 There
is merit to this argument; the trade-offs with alternative uses for
scarce and resource-hungry renewables are real and need to be carefully
considered -- something that DAC proponents are rarely wont to
do.139 The feasible scale of any DAC deployment is likely to depend on
it. [But if one imagines any future role for DAC at all, [one cannot put
off]{.mark} its [development until]{.mark} the [moment of need]{.mark}.
The [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} cannot be summoned ex nihilo circa
the year 2043; it [would [require]{.mark}]{.underline}, if only for
sheer physical reasons, [a **few [years]{.mark}** [to mature]{.mark}
from bantam to **climate-relevant scale**. [To pick up the slack]{.mark}
after emissions have ceased, [it must be **advanced
concurrently**]{.mark} with the cuts]{.underline}.140 The task of the
second round is thus an unenviable compound: to do both things at once:
bringing emissions to zero and preparing to go after what remains.

[[Historically]{.mark}, the [green movement has **disdained**
the]{.mark}]{.underline} reasoning of the
**[[techno]{.underline}]{.mark}**logical **[[fix]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and rightly so. [For]{.underline} the [most]{.underline} part [those
pursuing them]{.underline} in relation to the climate -- with madcap
schemes like blocking part of the sun with a 'space shade' in order to
manage solar radiation, or removing vast amounts of CO2 from the
atmosphere through carbon sequestration -- [don't want to save the
planet, but instead **prolong** the economic and social system which is
**killing it**]{.underline} -- one based on production for exchange,
profit and work.

[Green politics, at its most radical, has thus [insisted]{.mark} that
[an **adequate response** must be more
**fundamental**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within this was an implicit
understanding of how history unfolds and change takes place. So while
technological determinists understand technology as the driving force of
history, and thus the only way to address climate change, radical greens
understand social relations and ideas, or even relations to nature, as
what really matters.

[In this respect, both sides exhibit a **bias**. But to change history
and save the world, [this **isn't enough**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

How we make history.

[The [best way to understand tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology, how it
internalises and shapes social relations in culture, society and the
economy, [[is]{.mark} to view it as **[one element]{.mark}** with[in a
**broader ensemble**]{.mark} through which history evolves]{.underline}.
This is how David Harvey reads the thinking of Karl
**[[Marx]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the topic -- with the author
of Capital [[understand]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[history as constituted
through six distinct]{.mark} but **mutually adaptive [fields]{.mark}**.
These are **[tech]{.mark}**nology, **[nature]{.mark}**, the process of
**[production]{.mark}**, the reproduction of **[daily life]{.mark}**,
[**social relations** and **mental conceptions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
All are in dynamic tension, each constantly shaping and being shaped by
all the others.

[Marx wanted to understand how history was made in order to change
it]{.underline}: "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world
in various ways; the point is to change it". [When you think about
history as something that **complex**, and generated by fields which
each encompass so much, you soon grasp the **limits** of **emphasising
only one**]{.underline}.

[Elon Musk]{.underline}, for instance, [would say
tech]{.underline}nology [determines history, as would **capitalist
realism** more generally]{.underline}. This allows it to frame
constructed political realities as natural and unchanging. [Meanwhile an
eco-anarchist might say nature and social relations are **all
important**]{.underline}: maybe if we were all vegan and cycled we would
save the planet. [Alternatively, Lenin would have said the **production
process** is primary]{.underline}, and that without significant change
there the rest is meaningless.

[For Marx, however, [systemic transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} --
what he referred to as moving to a 'new mode of production' -- [would
[necessitate dealing with **all of these categories together**]{.mark}.
So just as capitalism, defined by production for exchange and wage
labour, **emerged slowly** over a period of centuries, so too would
whatever **succeeds it**. As post-capitalists, and as humans who want to
stop runaway climate change, this must inform **how we now
act**.]{.underline}

--

[[Given]{.mark} the **[timeframe]{.mark}** within which we are now
operating]{.underline} (we have around three decades to completely
decarbonise global production while energy demand doubles), [[this
**won't be easy**]{.mark}. The answer is to emphasise each moment as
part of a **broader shift**, with the need for new technologies, social
relations, mental conceptions, work flows and conceptions of nature. No
one sphere is **sufficient**]{.underline}.

While that might sound extremely hard, [[a lot of work has **already
been done**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The work of animal rights activists
and movements around changed eating habits mean that many now enjoy a
**very different relationship** to nature]{.underline}. And even those
of us who are not vegetarian or vegan would find the Cartesian view of
other animal species as automatons not only strange but inhumane. One of
the major changes in dealing with climate change will be changes in food
production and consumption, with meat in particular using prolific
amounts of water and land, and generating significant greenhouse gases
like methane. That's not to mention the ethics of animals as
commodities.

In response, expect vegetarianism and veganism to become increasingly
common in the coming decades. In addition to changed conceptions of
nature, [changing technology manifesting those conceptions will **also
matter** as, in the coming years, [meat substitutes become]{.mark}
**increasingly [authentic]{.mark}** and synthetic meat]{.underline} --
flesh without animals -- [finds a **mass market**]{.underline}. Using
far less water and land, and creating far less methane as a by-product,
synthetic meat is a far more efficient conversion of solar energy to
food than rearing animals -- something will probably be mocked in the
not-too-distant future.

Meanwhile [[renewable tech]{.mark}nologies are [making **massive leaps
forward**]{.mark}, as is energy storage]{.underline}. A world which has
completely decarbonised production at some point in the twenty-first
century is not the wet dream of tech optimists, but seemingly inevitable
when you look at the falling cost of PV and wind technologies as a
consequence of experience curves. [The [point]{.mark}, then, [is how
quick]{.mark}ly they are **rolled out** [and **who owns
them**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Similar questions will [need to be answer]{.mark}ed regarding
**[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**, [data]{.mark} more
generally, [and extracting]{.mark} resources **[beyond our
planet]{.mark}**. [All of these are **coming**]{.mark}, and with them a
new civilisational paradigm]{.underline} -- as disruptive as the steam
engine coupled with fossil fuels was at the dawn of the industrial
revolution. [[What matters]{.mark}, for post-capitalists, [is
whether]{.mark} or not [we **bend the arc of history** to ensure]{.mark}
that the dividend of these [tech]{.mark}nologies [redounds to]{.mark}
the **[emancipation of all of us]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- not enhancing
the profits of a tiny few.

Ecosocialism seems to be increasingly regarded as the most promising way
forward or even as essential in order to avoid a climate and ecological
catastrophe. However, [ecosocialism means different things to different
people, and it is not always clear what meaning is
intended]{.underline}. This article critically reviews some of the
different meanings and concludes that [[ecosocialism]{.mark} risks being
[**too narrowly 'socialist' to gain mass political support**]{.mark}
while at the same time tending to subordinate the '**ecological'** to
the '**social'**.]{.underline} What is ecosocialism? Here are some of
the answers that can be found in the literature: Hans Baer, in his book
Democratic eco-socialism as a real utopia, describes ecosocialism as a
global system that is \"highly democratic rather than authoritarian,
that ensures that all people have access to basic resources, and that is
at the same time environmentally sustainable and recognises that we live
on a fragile planet with limited resources.\" David Klein, in System
change not climate change, says: \"Ecosocialism is democratic and calls
for sustainable production based on human needs rather than profit. Of
critical importance, ecosocialism proposes a steady state economy that
does not require growth.\" In a recent issue of the journal Capitalism
Nature Socialism, Michael Albert sees ecosocialism as [[a broad]{.mark}
political [approach]{.mark} that encompasses]{.underline} \"the priority
of use-value over exchange-value; collective ownership and planning to
shape and constrain markets; \'contraction and convergence\' in
consumption levels between the global north and south.\" In the same
issue, Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro states that ecosocialism has
\"[socialist objectives and concerns over the state of ecosystems and
environment]{.underline}\", and 'socialist' means \"anyone striving for
the realisation of state-free, classless society.\" In an edition of the
same journal in 2020, Samuel Day Fassbinder suggested that: \"A
meaningful definition \[of ecosocialism\] might center upon a
sustainable, democratic society with public control over the means of
production.\" Michael Löwy, in his book on Ecosocialism in 2015,
conceptualised it as \"an ecologically rational society founded on
democratic control, social equality, and the predominance of use
value... This conception assumes collective ownership of the means of
production, democratic planning that makes it possible for society to
define the goals of investment and production, and a new technological
structure of the productive forces.\" The first of these interpretations
is a good description of the social system that most, if not all,
readers of The Ecologist would like to see, but it [is **not** what is
usually meant by [ecosocialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Workplace
organising and unions are important because collective action by
workers, particularly strikes, is of proven effectiveness. [It does not
mention abolishing capitalism or the state]{.underline} or social
classes or establishing public ownership and control. [It leaves open
the possibility that the current **capitalist system could be
reformed**, making it more democratic, fair and
sustainable.]{.underline} The second meaning comes closest to the first,
with the addition of the old socialist slogan of production for need not
profit. However, [this [ignores the capacity of capitalism to **provide
for need** as well as **profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The nature of
the democracy involved is also unclear. All]{.underline} the
[meanings]{.underline} except Engel-Di Mauro\'s [emphasise collective,
public or democratic ownership and control but they do not explain
**why** this is necessary to solve the climate crisis.]{.underline} For
example, Klein simply declares: 'To accomplish this, it will be
necessary to socialize virtually all large-scale industry.\" Albert
asserts: \"Ecosocialists convincingly demonstrate that capitalism is
incapable of resolving the climate and broader earth system crises in a
genuinely sustainable - let alone just - manner.\" Engel-Di Mauro\'s
interpretation is different in that it links
[[ecosocialism]{.underline}]{.mark} directly with an end to state and
class power. [The]{.underline} third, fourth and final meanings
prioritise the 'social' over the 'ecological'. The third one does not
explicitly include the ecological dimension, so it is socialist but not
ecosocialist - although of course a contraction of consumption in the
global North will bring ecological benefits. The fourth definition
appears to subordinate safeguarding life on earth to achieving the
abolition of states and classes. In reality, however, it [is probably
[**compatible** with]{.mark} working with [non-socialists who have
similar objectives]{.mark} and concerns about climate change and
ecocide]{.underline}. The final meaning leaves open the question of what
is 'ecologically rational'. Assuming the first meaning as our
overarching goal, we can ask what might be the most feasible and
effective ways to achieve that goal. [If we further assume that living
sustainably involves using only renewable energy, reusable or recyclable
materials, and agroecological methods, we can ask to what extent other
ecosocialist objectives might be necessary for that sustainable
living]{.underline}. [For example, what is **the role of government** in
transitioning to a fully renewable energy system - if any?]{.underline}
Here I focus only on the practical limitations of an approach that gives
overriding priority to overthrowing capitalism even if only as a means
to achieving our overarching goal. Arguably, [[what is missing]{.mark}
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} these understandings of [[ecosocialism
is]{.mark} an account of [the **processes** through which it can be
achieved]{.mark}]{.underline}. Albert, for example, is critical of those
[[ecosocialists]{.mark} who [offer only idealistic visions]{.mark} of a
future society [and wish lists]{.mark} for how to get
there]{.underline}, or who \"[[neglect difficult]{.mark} strategic
questions, [trade-offs]{.mark} and dangers [that would likely]{.mark}
[emerge during the transition]{.mark} process and beyond]{.underline}.\"
However, his preferred 'realist' approach is itself largely speculative
and contentious, especially on the issues of 'net energy decline',
'green jobs' and the debt burden of a radical Green New Deal, and it is
arguable that he exaggerates the technical and financial difficulties
involved in transitioning to ecosocialism. We can all agree with him
that, for a realistic transition, it is essential \"to engage in a
prolonged process of mass movement organizing and struggle on the
conjoined terrains of political-economy, culture, and public
discourse.\" But exaggerating the difficulties seems likely only to
discourage people from joining such a movement. In his latest book,
Future on Fire, the ecosocialist David Camfield also argues that our
only hope for a safe future is through mass social movements and he has
much to say about the nature of the movement that is needed. This can be
summarised as: sustained collective action, a diversity of people,
appealing to a wide spectrum of public opinion, making clear demands for
justice, remaining independent of the state and \"fundamentally
extra-parliamentary\". Rather than 'governing power' (the traditional
goal of socialists), his aim is for the movement \"to develop the power
to force governments to enact the climate justice measures that are
needed\". Building a mass social movement is therefore seen as the
critical task for ecosocialists. The foreword to Camfield\'s book by
Dharna Noor is refreshingly clear about what these measures include:
\"We must phase out coal, oil, and gas at once, reshape our transit
systems and housing plans, design a more humane and sustainable food
system, decarbonise every sector of the economy.\" This level of
specificity, however, is missing from the rest of Camfield book, which
mentions only \"a just and rapid shift away from fossil fuels and from
other sources of GHG pollution, accompanied with a range of actions to
draw down GHG levels in ways consistent with climate justice principles,
including planting trees on a very large scale\" as well as actions to
reverse biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, pandemics, and other
serious ecological problems. Consequently, [[the
movement]{.underline}]{.mark} seems to [[lack a
**technological**]{.mark} **or financial**
[dimension]{.mark}]{.underline} - for example, it could be pointed out
that [[it is **not possible**]{.mark}, even at a national level, [to
phase out all fossil fuels]{.mark} at once, because of our continued
dependence on gas boilers]{.underline}, internal combustion
[engines]{.underline}, [cement and steel]{.underline}, artificial
[fertilisers, plastics, and so on]{.underline}. While Albert worries
about [an imaginary future of '**authoritarian ecosocialism'**, where an
electorally successful red-green movement institutionalises state of
emergency provisions]{.underline}, Camfield is concerned to condemn
actually existing 'elitist radicalism' because of its potential to harm
and undermine the building of a mass movement. Elitist radicals are \"a
highly committed small minority\" who attack corporate or state targets
and [may use **violence**]{.underline}. The term \'attack\' as used here
does not mean a violent act. Camfield states - but without providing any
supporting evidence - that \"attacks by small groups won't win urgently
needed climate justice reforms, although they will lead to more intense
state repression that will hamper movement-building work\". In the court
of public opinion, however, things are not so straightforward: it all
depends on the nature of the attack, the motives for the attack and the
extent of public sympathy for the attackers. If we are really in an
emergency, which is recognised by most people, and the attack addresses
that emergency in some way, then it could attract more public support
and it could achieve something. Camfield is particularly sceptical about
tactics of violence against property such as those advocated by Andreas
Malm, in his book How to blow up a pipeline. He argues that: \"Attacks
on pipelines and other fossil fuel targets by small groups of activists
might hurt the profits of some firms, but they would cause little
disruption to the regular functioning of capitalist society. \"However,
they would certainly lead to more state repression against the climate
movement - and not just the groups of activists working secretly to
carry out vandalism and sabotage. \"This would make it more difficult to
organize effective kinds of mass direct action like strikes,
occupations, blockades, and incursions that disrupt fossil fuel
extraction or distribution, such as the 2016 Ende Gelände anti-coal mass
actions in Germany that Malm rightly praises.\" It is worth noting that
Malm does not call for activists to blow up pipelines in his book.
Instead, the acts of direct action he discusses including deflating the
tyres of highly polluting cars. Interestingly, some time after the book
was published some activists, including in the UK, did exactly that. But
Camfield goes on to suggest that these activists risk falling into
elitist radicalism. The possibility that the movement might be fully
supporting these small activist groups does not seem to have occurred to
him. And, for the sake of argument, if his scepticism were well founded,
then it would appear to follow that [one should be sceptical also about
[mass action]{.mark} insofar as it [can lead to **increased state
repression**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A historical example would be
anti-union laws introduced in response to the failure of the miners'
strike in the 1980s. Today we see the erosion of the right to protest in
response to recent mass movements. Germany is still mining coal and Ende
Gelände are still fighting against this, so one could question how
effective this struggle has really been. But such scepticism seems
likely to lead only to inaction and despair, not the hope that Camfield
rightly wants to encourage. Camfield also criticises Extinction
Rebellion's strategy. This has some validity in that [[there is **no
magic figure** for]{.mark} the proportion of [the population who need to
be in the]{.mark} mass [movement]{.mark} in order [to be
successful]{.mark}]{.underline}, nor is there any reason to suppose that
an unelected citizens' assembly would have any more influence over
government than an elected one. He could have added that XR's
self-sacrificing approach of courting arrest and even imprisonment is of
value only insofar as it increases support for the movement and/or for
the movement's objectives, and it remains unclear how effective this
approach has been so far. However, he does not mention XR's increasing
involvement in a wide range of struggles, particularly in solidarity
with workers and anti-racist groups - a shift of approach that chimes
better with his own preferred strategy for movement building. Workplace
organising and unions are important because collective action by
workers, particularly strikes, is of proven effectiveness, e.g. for
higher pay or improved working conditions. Workers' support is of course
essential for achieving a just transition. We [are left with a confusing
and somewhat disappointing picture. We know that radical social changes
are needed over the course of time, but **what, exactly?** We know that
emergency measures have to be taken immediately, but
**what?**]{.underline} [[Effective policy]{.mark} on climate and ecology
[requires]{.mark} mass [political support, and that in turn **requires**
popular]{.mark} economic and social [programmes]{.mark}]{.underline} on
social justice as well as climate justice - programmes that the public
see to be either necessary or desirable. As discussed by Albert, some
ecosocialists have tried to piggyback Green New Deals, but [none has yet
formulated a programme that has been demonstrated to have **mass
support**.]{.underline} I suggest the following reasons for this. First,
[most people do not subscribe to socialism and are not convinced that
the nationalisation of much of private industry is either necessary or
desirable]{.underline}. Second, [[although most
people]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[agree]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[capitalism has]{.underline}]{.mark} serious
[[flaws]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they are **not convinced** that it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} either necessary or [[desirable to abolish
it]{.underline}]{.mark} altogether. Third, [a [movement only of]{.mark}
'[exploited]{.mark} and oppressed [people']{.mark}]{.underline} as
described by Camfield [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} just [[not big enough to
solve the climate crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}: an [effective mass
movement]{.underline} to reverse climate change [must engage with **all
sections of society**]{.underline}. Fourth, if we are to have any kind
of stable future in this world, [[ecosocialists have no choice but
to]{.mark} work with non-socialists, inside, outside and across
political parties, [build]{.mark}ing [a **highly inclusive**]{.mark}
climate and ecological [movement]{.mark}, involving democratic
participation [and]{.mark} action at all levels and in all forms of
social organisation]{.underline}. To conclude, I would recommend, as a
minimum, a **[[focus on appropriate regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** -
nationalisation may or may not be appropriate - of fossil-fuel companies
and mandating a phasing out of emissions by 2030, combined with the
provision of universal basic services including on housing, transport
and food and a fair taxation system, including the taxing of carbon.
[Greater clarity on]{.underline} the reasons for [**democratic reform**
would also be helpful]{.underline}.

Omnipresent regulation must come to their aid and skew markets in favour

the question of what exactly the state should do with DAC: pave the way

count, is hardly viable. There is, as we have seen, no escaping the
trade-offs: a quantum of DAC capacity allotted to diamonds or synfuels

devoted to removal. The more carbon in the air and the greater the

[[For psychological welfare]{.mark}, [relative income]{.mark} level [is

As climate activist Greta Thunberg likes to remind her audiences, when
the house is on fire, you stop whatever you are doing and focus on
extinguishing. The message is that in our climate emergency all other,
petty concerns must be set aside. Applied to international relations,
this [**[aspirational]{.mark}** [thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} has some
[believing that climate change will imply the end of conflictual
geopolitics]{.underline}.44 There are practical reasons why this type of
thinking might have gathered momentum. After all, much of the world's
recent conflict history, including war after war in the Middle East in
the 1990s and early 2000s, was driven in large part by issues related to
petroleum. It might seem logical that once economies, as part of their
climate mitigation efforts, switch to renewables like solar and wind,
conflictual international relations will become a thing of the past.
Unfortunately, that [change]{.underline} is [**[very unlikely]{.mark}**
to]{.underline} [represent the end of geopolitics]{.underline}.45

First, the [overall premise is **wrong**]{.underline}, as [[oil and
gas]{.mark} will [not]{.mark} **[disappear]{.mark}**]{.underline} any
time [soon]{.underline}. Rather, we will observe a gradual shift in the
energy mix from traditional energy sources toward renewables.46 An
[effort]{.underline} [to fast-track the demise of highly polluting
coal]{.underline}, while renewable capacity is still building up, might
initially [lead to a **[counterintuitive increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the use of **[[methane]{.underline}]{.mark}**---
[which]{.underline} is, at least [for Europe]{.underline}, another
**[[source]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}ual
**geopolitical relations**]{.underline}, in its case [[with]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Second, as discussed in The New Map by energy expert and Pulitzer Prize
winner Daniel Yergin, [we are]{.underline} by [no means close
to]{.underline} seeing the [end of geopolitics and power
politics]{.underline} in the world. [Specifically]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the realm of [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [new
materials such as [r]{.mark}are-[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark}
will become focal points of contention]{.underline}. Because these
[minerals]{.underline} are key inputs to the construction of wind
turbines and electric cars, and will become
[[fundamental]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} our
[technology]{.underline}, varying levels of access to them will reshape
the world order and create new imperatives to ensure the safety of
supplies.47 [**[Military]{.mark}** [strategies]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
foreign [policy]{.mark} [priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} will be
[reoriented toward that goal]{.underline}, [just as]{.underline}
attention has been focused over the past decades on [**[securing]{.mark}
[oil]{.mark}** supply bottlenecks like the [Strait of Hormuz]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the Strait of Malacca]{.underline}.48 Indeed, we can
already get a sense of this, as the European Union has published, and
regularly updates, a list of what it calls "critical raw materials,"
necessary to ensure a strong industrial base to the European economy.
The US administration did the same, identifying thirty-five critical
minerals. For example, cobalt is featured on both lists, as a
fundamental mineral in low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles
and batteries, including those used every day in smartphones and
laptops. Responsible for almost 60 percent of the world's known reserves
and 97 percent of global exports of cobalt is the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, suggesting that this country will increasingly enter the
spotlight of global power politics.49

Any predictions about [geoeconomics]{.underline} must also acknowledge
that climate change is not the only megatrend at play; it
[overlaps]{.underline} [with]{.underline} others, including
[[digitalization]{.mark}, automation, [quantum]{.mark} computing,
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence, and big]{.underline}
[data]{.underline}, [all of which exhibit important winner-take-all
effects, and in all of which [countries]{.mark} will
**[compete]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A hugely important
[megatrend]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the [rise of China and the
re-dimensioning of the United States]{.underline} after roughly a
[century of global economic and political dominance]{.underline}.50 To
the relative "optimists," like political economist Dani Rodrik, the
relationship between China and the United States could
[evolve]{.underline} [into a]{.underline} milder, **[[second Cold
War]{.underline}]{.mark}** or mutual recognition of existence and
differences---an us and them dynamic within a framework of continued
reciprocal trade and investment. To the less optimistic, as the global
center of economic gravity shifts eastward, the [[risk of
**escalation**]{.mark} to more **open confrontation** between
superpowers is **[high]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In his 2017 book Destined for War, historian Graham Allison turned his
attention to what he called the **[[Thucydides]{.mark}
[trap]{.mark}]{.underline}**.51 [Analyzing]{.underline} the
[Peloponnesian War]{.underline} [that devastated]{.underline} ancient
Greece, the Athenian historian [Thucydides]{.underline}
[concluded]{.underline} that "it was the rise of Athens and the fear
that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable." How will the
[rise of a new superpower]{.underline} play out in the twenty-first
century? Allison reviews [**[sixteen]{.mark} [instances]{.mark}** of
swaps in economic supremacy]{.underline} [between countries over the
past five hundred years and paints a grim picture]{.underline}: [**[war
broke]{.mark} [out]{.mark}** in **twelve** of them]{.underline}. This
does not imply that war is inevitable, but suggests the
[**[SinoAmerican]{.mark}** relationship will shape geopolitics in
decades to come.]{.underline} **[Climate]{.underline}**
[mitigation]{.underline} [and **international cooperation**]{.underline}
will play out against a backdrop of [rising geopolitical tension between
at least two superpowers]{.underline}, which will [inevitably push other
countries to pick sides]{.underline}.

The [politics of degrowth]{.underline}

The [degrowth international vision to tackle]{.underline}
[climate]{.underline} change [centers on the proposition that
wealthy]{.underline} [countries]{.underline}, who have more than enough,
[will shrink their economies]{.underline}. By doing so, they will bring
down greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the risk of catastrophic climate
change. And they will do so to such an extent that space will be opened
up for poorer countries to develop, while the overall world economy and
global emissions remain within safe limits.

From a strictly moral standpoint, this might sound reasonable and
desirable. In light of what we have seen up to now, however, we can
state categorically that [there is **[no scenario]{.mark}**
under]{.underline} [which]{.underline} a small set of
[[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} [[willingly]{.mark} makes such an act
of self-[sacrifice]{.mark} for the global common good]{.underline}.52
While people are primed for altruism and self-sacrifices, these are
directed first toward their in-group, and only later toward others,
following geographical discounting. Democratic governments are bound by
their citizens' preferences, and therefore these basic human tendencies
define the set of policies that can be considered feasible. Naturally,
citizens of a country constitute only one type of in-group. Groups can
also arise based on shared culture, kinship, language, religion,
geography, and other affinities, as emphasized by Amartya Sen in
Identity and Violence.53 Humanity as a whole, however, cannot act as an
in-group in the absence of an outgroup, and this will not change in the
face of climate change.

The fond hope that some countries will actively shrink their economies
[ignores]{.underline} [the reality that]{.underline} these [rich
countries]{.underline} themselves will [remain in conditions of
relative]{.underline} [scarcity]{.underline}, which will only be felt
more acutely as climate change unleashes its negative effects. This
implies that the in-group will be [in constant need of extra
resources]{.underline}, to tackle the needs of the moment, which can be
[addressing]{.underline} incipient [desertification]{.underline},
[building]{.underline} [infrastructure to prevent flooding]{.underline},
and the like.

In addition, [countries]{.underline} themselves, [as we have seen,
experience relative income theory]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} will
[constantly compare themselves to the past and to other
countries]{.underline}. [While China's economy expands]{.underline} at a
high clip, you [cannot expect the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to look on with indifference]{.underline}. This is
not only [based]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [vague]{.underline}
predicaments like "[perceptions]{.underline}," or sinful feelings like
envy, but also on hard realities, like the fact that
[**[economic]{.mark} [might]{.mark}** goes hand in hand with **[military
spending]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} therefore
**[international]{.underline}** [political **influence**]{.underline}.
This, as we have seen before, [generates]{.underline} a sort of
[geopolitical growth imperative]{.underline}. [[Reduced
resources]{.mark} imply [less capacity to protect]{.mark}]{.underline}
(or project) a value system, [paving]{.underline} [the way to reduced
self-determination as a people.]{.underline}54

The idea, moreover, that [if rich countries shrink poor countries can
expand is based on an incomplete understanding of the economics of
development.]{.underline} In 2008, a group of nineteen leading
policymakers, mostly from developing economies, headed by two economics
Nobel laureates, put together The Growth Report, [analyzing the
experience of thirteen countries]{.underline} [that]{.underline} had
managed to [sustain high GDP growth since the 1950s]{.underline}.55
Drawing on the input of over three hundred distinguished academics, on
top of the personal hands-on experiences of the policymakers, [the
report sifted out common traits]{.underline} among successful cases.
These thirteen cases of "miracle" development, all of which featured
sharp reductions in extreme poverty, included China, postwar Japan,
South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, and Taiwan---and a [critical
feature of literally all of them was fast expansion of
exports]{.underline}.56 Note, however, that most exports go to foreign
lands that feature consumption aplenty---that is, the rich, growing,
industrialized countries.

[To recognize this is to see the flaw in the logic of rich countries
having to shrink to open up space for poor countries to
grow]{.underline}. The [whole idea]{.underline} is based on a
[**[misreading]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the global
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[zero-sum]{.underline}]{.mark}** game. [Pursuing]{.underline} a
[degrowth]{.underline} agenda [in the developed]{.underline} world would
b[ring about a **[collapse]{.mark}** of [global
**trade**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [closing]{.underline} [the door
to]{.underline} any hope of [fast growth in poor countries]{.underline},
[turning]{.underline} economic [miracles]{.underline} [into mirages, and
forcing **millions** to remain in **[extreme
poverty]{.mark}**]{.underline}.57

The analysis in this book leads to the conclusion that the [[socialist
movement **must** attain **state power**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a
[transition]{.mark} to socialism to take place]{.underline}.
[[Capitalism]{.mark} [is]{.mark} **not** just an economic
system]{.underline}. The **[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[aspect]{.underline} of capitalism plays an **[essential]{.underline}**
role [in]{.underline} the [**operation and reproduction** of the
system]{.underline}. The [[state]{.underline}]{.mark} [is the
institution that defines and [enforces]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[property relations]{.mark}]{.underline} of the capitalist system. The
state [guarantees]{.underline} the [right]{.underline} of capitalists
[to own and control productive]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other
[commercial property]{.underline}, to hire wage workers to do the work,
and to take the [profits]{.underline} derived [from the labor of
workers]{.underline}.1 The [[state]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[defines]{.mark} the range of permitted [market
exchanges]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as by banning the sale of people or
the hiring of young children.

[Some proposals call for moving beyond capitalism without taking state
power]{.underline}.2 That approach typically advocates building
institutions, such as producer and/or consumer coopera- tives,
worker-owned and/or controlled enterprises, and the like, with the
expectation that they would not just reform capitalism but displace
capitalist enterprises entirely. [It is **[not plausible]{.mark}** that
the **giant** capitalist **[companies]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
[banks]{.mark} would **[disappear]{.mark}** through such a
process]{.underline}. A [capitalist]{.underline} [system]{.underline}
[creates powerful]{.underline} **[advantages]{.underline}**

[competition with]{.underline} coops and other [non-capitalist
forms]{.underline}, as was noted in chapter 3. While some cooperative
and worker-run enter- prises have survived for long periods of time,
rather than the non-capitalist forms displacing capitalist enterprises,
the [non-capitalist forms tend to gradually adopt similar
behaviors]{.underline} [to]{.underline} those of their [capitalist
rivals]{.underline} [in order to **survive** in the **competitive

A [Gallup poll from]{.underline} 2018 (Newport 2018a)
[showed]{.underline} that [56 percent of Americans]{.underline} [had a
positive view of capitalism]{.underline}. This poll set off alarm bells
in many quarters by noting that favorable views of capitalism had
[slipped from 61 percent]{.underline} in 2010, with almost all the
erosion among people aged 18 to 29. It found that positive views of
capitalism among those aged 18 to 29 had fallen from 68 percent to 45
percent between 2010 and 2018, as a new cohort entered this age range.
Moreover, the [poll]{.underline} [showed]{.underline}
that [more]{.underline} of these [young adults]{.underline} [had a
positive view of socialism]{.underline} (51 percent) [than
capitalism]{.underline} (45 percent). A later survey (Victims of
Communism Memorial Foundation 2020) found that 26 percent of Americans
support the gradual elimination of the capitalist system in favor of a
more socialist system---with support for elimination noticeably higher
among Gen Zs (31 percent) and Millennials (35 percent).

[Are we to understand]{.underline} that the majority of [younger

economy]{.underline} in which the [government owns the means of
production]{.underline} and directs the economy (socialism) to private
ownership and decentralized decision making (capitalism)? And that many

economy? [Probably **not**]{.underline}---because [another Gallup

[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Americans]{.mark} [**no longer**
hold]{.mark} the [**traditional** definition]{.mark} of
socialism]{.underline}. Sorry, Karl and Vladimir, Americans don't use
your definition of socialism anymore---they use Bernie's definition.
[When]{.underline} Gallup [asked]{.underline} people [to explain their
[understanding]{.mark} of the term
"**[socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}," the most common responses in 1949
included terms like "government ownership or control" (34 percent), but
this fell to only 17 percent in 2018. The [most widely used definition
today is "**[equality]{.mark}**]{.underline}---equal standing for
everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution" at 23 percent. In
third place is "benefits and services---social services free, medicine
for all" (10 percent), and another 6 percent add wording like "[talking
to people**, [being social]{.mark}**, ... getting along with
people]{.underline}."\[3\]

Likewise, a YouGov survey (Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation
2020, 20) finds that [while **32 percent** of Americans identify
socialism as the government **owning** all property and controlling
"nearly 100% of the national economy]{.underline}," approximately equal
in size (**[[31 percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**) are those who
[[say]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[socialism]{.mark}
[means]{.mark}]{.underline} "a **[[free]{.mark} [market
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[with **private**]{.mark}
**[property]{.mark}**]{.underline} but one where the government provides
ample social welfare benefits." And [15 percent]{.underline}
[equate]{.underline} [socialism]{.underline} with "[a free market
economy]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [private property]{.underline}
where the government intervenes when necessary to create an even playing
field for all citizens and businesses."

So, [many]{.underline} [Americans' definition of socialism]{.underline}
**[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[make]{.underline}]{.mark}
[it]{.underline} a system that is **[[distinct]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[from]{.underline} [capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. To them---perhaps
those who are more likely to have a favorable opinion of
socialism---it's [about]{.underline} **[private
production]{.underline}** along with [[equality]{.mark}, getting
[free]{.mark} things, [and]{.mark} [being]{.mark} nice]{.underline}. In
some ways, this is [surprisingly **[similar]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the
definition of **[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Capitalism]{.underline} has turned out to be [about reducing the costs
of things]{.underline} so that they are much closer to free. As Martin
Tupy and Gale Pooley (2022) demonstrate, at prevailing market wages and
prices the amount of time needed to buy a basket of fifty commodities
fell by 72 percent between 1980 and 2018, and the time needed to buy
finished goods and services fell at about the same rate. Likewise,
[markets]{.underline} [are about being nice to people]{.underline} [to
get them to voluntarily interact]{.underline} with you, [rather than
forcing your will]{.underline} upon them [as in]{.underline} other
systems like [socialism]{.underline} (traditional definition) and
feudalism. This idea of [[doux]{.mark} (sweet)
[commerce]{.mark}]{.underline} was developed by Baron Montesquieu in The
Spirit of the Laws (1734). The thesis [argues]{.underline} that
[commerce [and trade]{.mark} soften]{.underline} and polish what had
been harsh, [warlike, and barbaric values and
behaviors]{.underline}---teaching individuals, and society as a whole,
toleration and peaceful manners as it embodies the give-and-take of
parties who can each walk away from any proposed exchange.

### Alt\-\--AT: Social Media\-\--2AC

#### Every reason [omits]{.underline} data and is [misinformation]{.underline}.

sofia

One reason [young [people]{.mark} [support
socialism]{.mark}]{.underline} is [because]{.underline} their [[social
media]{.mark} feeds]{.underline} [[show]{.underline}]{.mark} videos made
by popular but [**[economically illiterate]{.mark}**
[people]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[TikTok star Madeline Pendleton]{.underline} has 1.6 million
subscribers. My new video [shows]{.underline} her telling them:
\"[Socialism is working better than capitalism 93 percent of the
time]{.underline}!\"

[Where does she get]{.underline} [93]{.underline} [percent]{.underline}?

[From a study]{.underline} published in 1986 by self-described Marxists
in the Journal of Health Services.

The [[authors]{.mark} conveniently **[ignore]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[and]{.underline} other [wealthy countries]{.underline} and
[[compare]{.mark} [socialist]{.mark}]{.underline} [economies [to]{.mark}
\"**capitalist**\" [countries]{.mark} like Uganda, Rwanda, and
Somalia,]{.underline} some of which were [[at]{.mark}
**war**]{.underline}.

[It\'s so **stupid**]{.underline}. But based on that, Pendleton tells
her followers, \"We have all the data showing that socialism does
work.\"

[She]{.underline} also [celebrates communism because]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [its \"increased life expectancy]{.underline}.\"

[That\'s **nonsense**]{.underline}, too. [[People live **longest** in
**capitalist**]{.mark} **countries**]{.underline} [like
[Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} [(85 years]{.underline}) [[and]{.underline}
[South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} ([84 years]{.underline}). Even in the
United States (79 years), where more of us die young because we drive
more (car accidents), eat more, shoot each other more often, and try
more dangerous drugs, we still live [longer than people in China (78
years]{.underline}).

[Socialism]{.underline} is also [superior]{.underline}, says Pendleton,
because of \"the [90-100 percent home ownership rates]{.underline}.\"

\"One hundred percent,\" [of course, is just **dumb**]{.underline}, but
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} (if you believe the party\'s statistics)
does [have 90 percent [homeownership]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[But not under socialism]{.underline}! They
[[achieved]{.underline}]{.mark} that only [**[after
privatizing]{.mark}** urban [housing]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Before]{.underline} 1998, when Chinese housing was still socialist,
[just 20 percent of Chinese people owned homes]{.underline}.

[Several social media stars rave about China]{.underline}. \"Socialism
worked in China!\" says TikToker Dante Munoz. \"They lifted over 800
million people from poverty.\"

Again, it\'s true that in the last 50 years, China\'s [[g]{.mark}ross
[d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct]{.underline} (GDP) went from \$156
per capita to more than \$12,000. But that [**[only]{.mark}** happened
**[after]{.mark}** [China **gave up** on]{.mark} **real
[socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[started
**embracing markets**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Hong Kong]{.underline},
[which adopted actual capitalism]{.underline}, [raised]{.underline} per
capita [GDP]{.underline} [to \$50,000.]{.underline}

[Before]{.underline} China [reform]{.underline}ed,
[millions]{.underline} of people [**died** of
**starvation**]{.underline}.

[Another silly social media star,]{.underline} J.T. Chapman,
[tells]{.underline} his almost 2 million YouTube
[subscribers]{.underline}: \"The central idea that unites all
[socialists]{.underline} is [maximizing
freedom]{.underline}...[democratization of power]{.underline}.\"

**[Democratization]{.underline}**? [In most socialist countries,
there\'s only **one** political **party**]{.underline}.

A popular TikToker calling himself Rathbone tells his hundred thousand
subscribers: \"capitalism...prioritizes profits over people...\[but\]
socialism...prioritizes people over profits.\"

Likewise, Chapman says socialism offers the \"guaranteed right
to...health care, food, and shelter.\"

Well, of course socialism promises those things and claims to prioritize
people over profits, but what people actually get is different.

As Cuban doctors put it in this video, \"The Cuban health care system is
destroyed....People are dying in the hallways.\"

[Yet Chapman [claims]{.mark}]{.underline}, \"[[Innovation]{.mark} can
[flourish]{.mark}]{.underline} even [when]{.underline} people are [not
motivated by profit]{.underline}. The [USSR]{.underline}
[gave]{.underline} the world the anthrax [vaccine]{.underline},
artificial [satellites]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} one of the
earliest mobile [phones]{.underline}.\"

[That is true]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} no one uses those phones
today. [**[Capitalism]{.mark}** just [creates **much
more**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, [Chapman says,]{.underline} \"[Ownership should be
collective]{.underline}.\"

Collective ownership does feel good. \"We\'ll share everything!\"

But [every attempt]{.underline} at collective ownership [has
**failed**]{.underline}.

One famous American example: 200 years ago, New Harmony, Indiana,
abolished private property, promising a \"[community of
equality]{.underline}.\"

The [result was **famine**]{.underline}.

When people realized they could receive just as much barely working as
they could working hard, many, naturally, worked less. Within a year,
the commune experiment failed and property was returned to private
hands.

[What do these popular social media stars say when I confront them with
these inconvenient truths? Sadly, I don\'t know]{.underline}. Not one
would appear on Stossel TV to debate.

The [bottom line: Incentives matter]{.underline}. No one washes a rental
car. Few people care much about what belongs to everyone. It\'s just
human nature.

[Capitalism isn\'t perfect]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} if we want a
better future, and freedom, [[capitalism]{.mark} is the [**only thing**
that works]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Third, there is the [possibility]{.underline} that a
[[GND]{.underline}]{.mark} may **[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[current private and public **[debt]{.mark}** burden]{.underline}
[[plaguing]{.mark} global [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[without]{.mark} generating]{.underline}** the
**[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [needed to make it
sustainable]{.underline}. Private and public [debt]{.underline} had
[already reached record]{.underline} [levels]{.underline}
[before]{.underline} the [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic, and
[post-pandemic]{.underline} total debt levels have reached an [estimated
432% of GDP in rich countries]{.underline} (Dowding Citation2021). The
mountain of consumer and corporate debt is a much more [pressing
**[concern]{.mark}** [to **financial stability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
while sovereign debt (at least in core states like the US) can
theoretically accumulate without limit, though the latter can still be a
concern if future conditions change (particularly so long as we remain
in a world of footloose capital and predominantly privatized control
over money-creation) (Mellor Citation2019). [Fiscal
expansion]{.underline} to [create]{.underline} [jobs]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [accelerate]{.underline} the [RE
transition]{.underline} is absolutely vital in the near-term.
[But]{.underline} the [view]{.underline} [that it would have a
**positive long-term impact** on economic]{.underline}
growth---advocated by centrist as well as leftwing GND proposals (e.g.
IMF Citation2020; Pollin Citation2018) ---may be [based]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} [**unrealistic** expectations about future
inflation]{.underline} (e.g. by ignoring "greenflation" risks). In
contrast, [if net]{.underline} [energy decline constrains efforts to
increase productivity]{.underline} and raises food and energy costs
across the economy, then state expenditures may not be met by a
corresponding increase of aggregate demand, economic growth, and tax
revenues. Furthermore, the [global financial system]{.underline} will be
[facing]{.underline} an [intensification of "physical" and
"transition]{.underline}" risks in the coming decades: [extreme weather,
crop shortages, and supply chain disruptions]{.underline} from climate
change on one hand; and "[carbon [bubble" risks]{.mark}]{.underline} on
the other [[as]{.mark} the [world weans off fossil]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} (Bolton et al. Citation2020). We might then
[witness]{.underline} a [convergence of stagnant
productivity]{.underline}, [**[inflationary shocks]{.mark}**, and
financial systemic]{.underline} [risks]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
constrain if not **[[derail]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**GND**'s
[growth]{.mark} trajectory]{.underline}; in this case, the "fiscal
multiplier" would fail to materialize, and a [**[protracted
period]{.mark}** [of "**stagflation**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (comparable
to the ongoing inflationary shock triggered by Putin's invasion of
Ukraine) may result.

[Some ideas]{.underline} are [so]{.underline} [incredibly [**asinine**
and **destructive**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [you\'ll]{.underline} of
course [find]{.underline} [some **high-brow academic**]{.underline}
movement [that promotes]{.underline} [them]{.underline}. [Such is the
case with]{.underline} something known
as \"**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"---[a burgeoning
philosophy]{.underline} arguing that humanity\'s continuing pursuit of
economic betterment is unsustainable and a threat to the planet. Popular
among environmentalists, it\'s a predictable end point for some
climate-change warriors.

Per a pro-degrowth website, this idea \"critiques the global capitalist
system which pursues growth at all costs, causing human exploitation and
environmental destruction.\" It wants to \"prioritize social and
ecological well-being instead of corporate profits...and excess
consumption.\" Degrowth \"requires radical redistribution, reduction in
the material size of the global economy, and a shift in common values
towards care, solidarity, and autonomy.\"

[It\'s the latest environmental-oriented take on the
[same-old **left-wing totalitarianism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as it
would take immense government power to radically redistribute resources
and determine how to re-order society. [However this concept would be
implemented, it [certainly]{.mark} would **[enslave]{.mark}** [and
**impoverish**]{.mark} virtually **[everyone]{.mark}**, and [lead
to]{.mark} **[famine and misery]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark} is [unlikely]{.underline} [to become a
governing model anytime soon]{.underline}, but it\'s [best to debunk
**[dangerous]{.mark} [idiocy]{.mark}** as it rears its
head]{.underline}. One might argue that progressive policy makers in
California are engaged in a kinder, gentler version as they crush
the oil and gas industry and try to remake our economy and rejigger
land-use patterns to promote a \"sustainable\" and carbon-free future.

[I\'m **[fascinated]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the degrowth movement because
of its **[mind-blowing misunderstanding]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} modern
[society\'s unparalleled]{.mark} [success]{.mark} in
improving]{.underline} the [human condition]{.underline}. With full
bellies and [from the comfort of their climate-controlled homes in
Western democracies]{.underline}, [degrowth]{.underline}
[theorists]{.underline} [propose]{.underline} **[[turning back]{.mark}
the [clock]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[myriad
advancements]{.underline}]{.mark} that have extended and improved our
lives. [Its mere existence reminds us that every generation is
susceptible to **[utopian nonsense]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\"The point is not to end a \'bad\' economy and put a \'good\' one in
its stead, to have \'good\' growth or \'good\' development by declaring
them ecological or social or \'fair trade,\' by throwing in some state
regulations or some notions of giving and solidarity,\" writes one of
degrowth\'s best-known modern theorists, French professor Serge
Latouche. \"The point is to get out of economics.\"

[He envisions]{.underline} an alternate world \"somewhat akin to those
[**Stone Age** affluent societies]{.underline} that...never had an
economy.\" Well, at least he said the quiet part out loud. The
[average life expectancy]{.underline} in the Stone Age was [20-25
years]{.underline}. [I doubt humans]{.underline} [were]{.underline}
particularly [happy]{.underline} (happiness is a degrowth goal)
[when]{.underline} [life was so **nasty, brutish, and
short**]{.underline}. I actually never thought I\'d see the
terms \"Stone Age\" and \"affluent\" in the same sentence.

[There is **[no \"getting out\" of economics]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Economics]{.underline} simply [refers]{.underline} [to the
way]{.underline} that [societies]{.underline} [handle]{.underline} the
age-old question of **[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Latouche claims economics is like religion, but it\'s more like a
science. [One cannot]{.underline} simply [wish]{.underline}
[away]{.underline} the forces of [gravity or scarcity]{.underline}.
[There\'s **[always]{.mark}** more **[demand]{.mark}** for necessary and
desired things]{.underline}---food, medical care, housing---than their
availability. [Degrowthers are the ones who sound like religious
mystics.]{.underline}

[Market-based economies]{.underline} create incentives that unleash
human creativity and [provide incredible abundance.]{.underline}
Command-and-control economies, whether run by warlords or technocratic
planners, result in shortages and poverty. [As the world has moved
toward a [growth]{.mark}-based economy, worldwide **[poverty]{.mark}**
has **[plummeted]{.mark}**. Quality of [life]{.mark} has
**[improved]{.mark}** almost [everywhere]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [post-World War II economic boom has seen the world get much
richer]{.underline}, Vox explains in a 2021 rebuttal to the degrowthers:
\"It means [**[cancer treatments]{.mark}** and neonatal intensive
care]{.underline} [units]{.underline} and [smallpox
**[vaccines]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} insulin]{.underline}. It means, in
many parts of the world, [houses have indoor
**[plumbing]{.mark}**]{.underline} and gas heating and electricity. It
means that [infant **mortality** is **down** and [life]{.mark}
expectancies are **[longer]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" It means
better-quality foods.

While mainstream environmentalists attempt to mitigate the down sides of
growth while keeping the good stuff, an increasingly \"vocal slice of
climate activists,\" has [abandoned such pragmatism and embraced these
radical concepts, ]{.underline}Vox adds. A World Economic
Forum piece quotes the Vox critique as well as degrowthers who argue
their movement isn\'t about living in caves, but about \"people in rich
countries changing their diets, living in smaller houses and driving and
traveling less.\"

CAMBRIDGE -- The concept of degrowth has recently captured the
imagination of academics, activists, and politicians -- particularly in
rich countries -- who are concerned about environmental sustainability
and socioeconomic justice. Last May, the European Parliament organized
a Beyond Growth Conference. Since then, a spate of articles (including
in leading scientific journals) has documented the rise of this
once-niche movement, which calls for abandoning GDP growth as a goal,
reducing energy and material use, and focusing economic activity on
human well-being. 

But despite the fervor of its adherents, the
[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark} movement [**[lacks]{.mark}** a
[**coherent theory** of change]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and is thus a
**[dead end]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [While]{.underline} the
[ideals]{.underline} that underpin the movement and some of
its proposals, such as universal access to public services and a
green-jobs guarantee, [resonate powerfully]{.underline},
[its]{.underline} overarching [goals are politically
impractical]{.underline}. Moreover, because [degrowth is an
[all-or-nothing]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}, it would actually
[**[impede]{.mark}** [progress on climate]{.mark} policy]{.underline}. 

For starters, [degrowth]{.underline} is [premised on the
idea]{.underline} that "[the system" is to blame for]{.underline} our
[climate]{.underline} predicament, which [implies]{.underline} that [the
solution is to [abolish]{.mark} [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this context, advocates do not view incremental progress toward the
movement's stated goals, such as reduced working hours or targeted
bans on highly polluting activities, as a step in the right direction;
on the contrary, they interpret such changes as a way for policymakers
to defend the current system against criticism. In other words, reform
is anti-revolutionary. 

At the international level, degrowth calls for actively shrinking rich
economies and launching a voluntary transfer of resources to the Global
South. Notwithstanding abstract social-justice considerations, this
would be a **[[political non]{.mark}-starter]{.underline}**: [when
[fewer]{.mark} [resources]{.mark} are available]{.underline},
[[countries]{.underline} [become **less**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, not
more, **[generous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Even now]{.underline},
[when]{.underline} advanced [economies are expanding]{.underline},
[securing]{.underline} adequate **[[funding]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
the Loss and Damage Fundoperationalized at last year's United Nations
Climate Change Conference in Dubai [has proven
**[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

On a societal level, degrowthers urge a collective moral awakening. If
only people fully grasped the damage caused by the current economic
model, the thinking goes, they would rapidly embrace an ascetic
lifestyle. They would give up meat, flying, SUVs, and other
carbon-intensive products and services. 

But [while proponents of degrowth imagine an enlightened society,
betting on the moral improvement of humankind is a **poor
wager**]{.underline}. As philosopher Emrys Westacott has shown, most
world religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, and
Confucianism, have long preached simple living. It is safe to assume,
given the state of the planet, that these [calls for
moderation]{.underline} have [done little to tame the **[relentless
drive for consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Expecting]{.underline}]{.mark} [a moral revolution to kickstart
[structural transformation]{.mark} is like [**waiting** for
**Godot**]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

#### Degrowth is [infeasible]{.underline} and [exacerbates]{.underline} the climate crisis.

**Naude '23** (Wim Naude, Visiting Professor at RWTH Aachen University,
Germany and ASC Fellow, "Why Degrowth won't save the world" July 17 2023
https://wol.iza.org/opinions/why-degrowth-wont-save-the-world //vo)

From these, several reasons can be highlighted for why
**[[degrowth]{.mark} [is no option]{.mark}]{.underline}**- and which I
elaborate in my recent IZA discussion papers available here and here:

[**Degrowth will not decrease decarbonization** enough]{.underline}.

[Most (63%) of current **[carbon emissions come from developing
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} - where it will only continue to
increase in the foreseeable future. [China is building the equivalent of
two new coal-fired power plant every week]{.underline}. [[Only
**reducing rich countries' GDPs**]{.mark} **[will not]{.mark} result
in** enough **decarbonization** to [limit global warming]{.mark} in line
with global commitments]{.underline}.

**[[Degrowth will make matters worse]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Degrowth may be dirty. [Global redistribution will increase aggregate
consumption through a well-known \"growth through redistribution\"
effect]{.underline}. [Degrowth may [cause **low-income households** to
**revert** to]{.mark} deforestation and **[environmental
destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} - as they in fact did during the
2022-2023 winter in Europe when faced with steeply rising energy prices.
[And much [**less resources will be available** to]{.mark} invest in
making [the transition]{.mark} to renewable energy]{.underline}. Thus,
as Nobel Laureate Ted Nordhaus concluded, [degrowth may \"**do more
harm** to the planet than good\".]{.underline}

[[Degrowth is **politically infeasible**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

**[[Humans are loss averse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, [if over the
short-term, levels of income (GDP) would fall, happiness would fall
too.]{.underline} Because of the endowment effect, people would attach
high value to their levels of GDP per capita. [They would [therefore be
unlikely to vote]{.mark} for politicians who propose lowering their
levels of GDP per capita]{.underline}. And politicians, being generally
subject to a status quo bias, would be reluctant to propose such a
radical policy. As Degrowth proponents acknowledge "political parties
that have put forward degrowth ideas have received limited support in
elections."

[[Degrowth policies]{.mark} are disappointing.]{.underline}

The degrowth movement has come up with a long list of policy proposals.
The extent of this list of "degrowth policies" suggests that everything
can be thrown in under "degrowth." A recent inventory identified 530
proposals. [**The prominent policies** are universal basic income,
work-time reductions, job guarantees, maximum income caps,
non-for-profit cooperation's, eco-villages, and housing
cooperatives.]{.underline}

[None of these are novel. Most are or **[have]{.mark} already [been
implemented]{.mark}** - most extensively **[in market
economies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, the first deliberate

[**[Degrowth may be irresponsible]{.mark}** / unethical]{.underline}.

We would not imagine subjecting human populations to potentially
dangerous experimental drugs without first rigorously testing their
efficacy. Why embrace the "medicine" prescribed by the degrowth
movement? Olivier Simar-Casanova points out that "[Global warming is a
serious issue and claiming to respond to it with solutions of uncertain
carbon efficiency, which we do not know how to implement in practice, is
irresponsible." Degrowth may furthermore [make the world]{.mark} much
more **[exposed and vulnerable]{.mark} to shocks**, make the adjustment
to a zero-carbon-emitting economy more costly, [and **raise the risk of
conflict**]{.mark} by turning the economy into a zero-sum

[[Mos]{.underline}t]{.mark} current carbon
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (63%) [[come from **developing**

increase. China, for example, is building the equivalent of two new
coal-fired power plants every week.

Many of the world's major carbon pollutors -- fossil fuel companies --
are located [in]{.mark} the **[[global south]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
They include **[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Aramco, National
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian Oil, Petroleos
**[[Mexican]{.mark}os]{.underline}**,
Petro**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Petroleos de
**[[Venezuela]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[Kuwait]{.underline}]{.mark}** Petroleum. They are also
[**[government owned]{.underline}**]{.mark} or controlled, which makes
it rather strange that Jason Hickel is
advocating [nationalisation](https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1330445163819380737) of
fossil fuel companies as a degrowth-solution...

Degrowth considers the global south to be exempt from degrowth. This is
an implicit acknowledgement that degrowth can do harm. The movement has
also [argued](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1057/s41301-023-00360-9?sharing_token=rW47li8tlUMeiCE_UD4KM1xOt48VBPO10Uv7D6sAgHv-DJSGIlutQg2eSUTMreNALHUql2pXjyM_N0mR30sNTJjmmQPBjmSkdFwNIqbJ-29qoVvqm0bQ4yMwghzbQ2kA9XztfHjrfrbAWFM2twf_oeEpn0-UxiwwaAZGc5K4Vn8=) that
developed countries should compensate the global south. This implies
giving a free pass to global south polluters whose fossil fuel rich
governments will get trillions in reparation money to further invest in
their polluting industries.

[**[Degrowth]{.underline}**]{.mark} would also be
[**[ineffective]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Most of its key proposals are
likely to stimulate economic growth and consumption, not curtail it. For
example, the degrowth movement calls for
energy [sufficiency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620300165),
basic
income [grants](https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/opinion/2023-04-03-basic-income-grant-modelling-shows-how-to-do-it-as-a-boost-to-the-economy/) and four-day
working weeks. It proposes banning advertising. All of these
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} be subject to
[**[rebound]{.underline}**]{.mark} effects -- they would actually
[[stimulate]{.underline}]{.mark} economic [[**growth** and
**materialisation**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the economy.

But degrowth might not only be ineffective in reducing ecological
overshoot. It might [[turn out to be **dirty**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

First, **[[redistribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** towards less developed
countries, as degrowth proposes, would [[stimulate]{.underline}]{.mark}
economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** and aggregate consumption
growth in developing countries. Strangely, although degrowthers reject
neoclassical economic growth theory, they seem to adhere to its tenet
that redistribution has no effect on economic growth.

Second, with reduced income, [[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} countries
would [[have **fewer**]{.underline}]{.mark} resources [[to invest
in]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change [[mitigation and
adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies. Degrowthers may counter
that countries could just reallocate their expenditure away from
conspicuous consumption towards such green investment. But that would be
inconsistent with the fact that the [[most
innovative]{.underline}]{.mark} countries are not Jason Hickel's
poster-children such as Sri Lanka or Cuba, but [[those with the
**highest GDP**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the USA and Switzerland.
Innovation costs money. Kate Raworth is therefore mistaken when she
claims that "boundaries unleash creativity."

With resources and innovation under degrowth pressure,
[[firms]{.underline}]{.mark} might simply [[replace]{.underline}]{.mark}
expensive cleaner production techniques [[with
cheaper]{.underline},]{.mark} but [[**more polluting**
ones]{.underline}.]{.mark} And without future growth,
[[debt]{.underline}]{.mark} would **[[contract]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[starving risky]{.underline}]{.mark} but necessary **[[investment
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Still, the [[degrowth]{.mark} project [is **nowhere** near]{.mark}
enjoying the degree and type of [support it needs]{.mark}]{.underline}
if its policies are to be implemented through democratic processes. The
number of political parties, labour unions, business associations and
international organisations that have so far embraced degrowth is modest
to say the least. Economic and political [**[elites]{.mark}**, including
social democratic parties and most of the trade union movement, [are
united]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in the belief that economic growth
is necessary and desirable. This consensus finds support in the
prevailing type of economic theory and underpins the main contenders in
the neoliberal project, such as centre-left and nationalist projects. In
spite of the world\'s multidimensional crisis, a pro-growth discourse in
other words continues to be hegemonic: it is widely considered a matter
of common sense that continued economic growth is required.

It is also noteworthy that economic and political
**[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to a large extent, continue to
[[support]{.underline}]{.mark} the neoliberal [[project, even
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the face of its evident
**[[shortcomings]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, [the]{.mark}
20**[[08]{.underline}]{.mark}** financial [[crisis did
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} result in the
**[[weaken]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing of transnational financial
[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark} that could have paved the way for a
paradigm shift. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark} of coming to an end,
neoliberal capitalism has arguably [[entered]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[more authoritarian phase]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bruff, 2014). The
main reason the power of the pre-crisis coalition remains intact is that
governments stepped in and saved the dominant fraction by means of
massive bailouts. It is a foregone conclusion that this fraction and
[the]{.mark} wider [[coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} behind the
neoliberal paradigm (transnational industrial capital, the middle
classes and segments of organized labour) will
[[consider]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}
paradigm [[unattractive]{.underline}]{.mark} and that such social forces
will vehemently oppose the implementation of degrowth policies (see also
Rees, 2014: 97).

While degrowth advocates envision a future in which market forces play a
less prominent role than they do today, degrowth is not an antimarket
project. As such, it can attract support from certain types of market
actors. In particular, it is worth noting that social enterprises, such
as cooperatives (Restakis, 2010), play a major role in the degrowth
vision. Such enterprises are defined by being 'organisations involved at
least to some extent in the market, with a clear social, cultural and/or
environmental purpose, rooted in and serving primarily the local
community and ideally having a local and/or democratic ownership
structure' (Johanisova et al., 2013: 11). Social enterprises currently
exist at the margins of a system, in which the dominant type of business
entity is profit-oriented, shareholder-owned corporations. The further
dissemination of social enterprises, which is crucial to the transitions
to degrowth societies, is -- in many cases -- blocked or delayed as a
result of the centrifugal forces of global competition (Wigger and
Buch-Hansen, 2013). Overall, social enterprises thus (still) constitute
a social force with modest power.

Ougaard (2016: 467) notes that one of the major dividing lines in the
contemporary transnational capitalist class is between capitalists who
have a material interest in the carbon-based economy and capitalists who
have a material interest in decarbonisation. The latter group, for
instance, includes manufacturers of equipment for the production of
renewable energy (ibid.: 467). As mentioned above, degrowth advocates
have singled out renewable energy as one of the sectors that needs to
grow in the future. As such, it seems likely that the owners of national
and transnational companies operating in this sector would be more
positively inclined towards the degrowth project than would capitalists
with a stake in the carbon-based economy. Still, the prospect of the
"green sector" emerging as a driving force behind degrowth currently
appears meagre. Being under the control of transnational capital
(Harris, 2010), such companies generally embrace the "green growth"
discourse, which 'is deeply embedded in neoliberal capitalism' and
indeed serves to adjust this form of capitalism 'to crises arising from
contradictions within itself' (Wanner, 2015: 23).

In addition to support from the social forces engendered by the
production process, a political project 'also needs the political
ability to mobilize majorities in parliamentary democracies, and a
sufficient measure of at least passive consent' (van Apeldoorn and
Overbeek, 2012: 5--6) if it is to become hegemonic. As mentioned,
degrowth enjoys little support in parliaments, and certainly the
pro-growth discourse is hegemonic among parties in government.5 With
capital accumulation being the most important driving force in
capitalist societies, political decision-makers are generally eager to
create conditions conducive to production and the accumulation of
capital (Lindblom, 1977: 172). Capitalist states and international
organisations are thus "programmed" to facilitate capital accumulation,
and do as such constitute a strategically selective terrain that works
to the disadvantage of the degrowth project.

The main advocates of the degrowth project are grassroots, small
fractions of left-wing parties and labour unions as well as academics
and other citizens who are concerned about social injustice and the
environmentally unsustainable nature of societies in the rich parts of
the world. The project is thus ideationally driven in the sense that
support for it is not so much rooted in the material circumstances or
short-term self-interests of specific groups or classes as it is rooted
in the conviction that degrowth is necessary if current and future
generations across the globe are to be able to lead a good life. While
there is no shortage of enthusiasts and creative ideas in the degrowth
movement, it has only modest resources compared to other political
projects. To put it bluntly, the advocates of degrowth [do not
**[possess]{.underline}** instruments]{.mark} that enable them [to
**[force]{.underline}**]{.mark} political [[decision-makers to
listen]{.underline}]{.mark} to -- let alone comply with -- their views.
As such, they are in a weaker position than the labour union movement
was in its heyday, and they are in a far weaker position than the owners
and managers of large corporations are today (on the structural power of
transnational corporations, see Gill and Law, 1989).

6\. Consent

It is also safe to say that degrowth enjoys no "passive consent" from
the majority of the population. For the time being, [[degrowth remains
**unknown**]{.mark} to **most people**]{.underline}. Yet, if it were to
become generally known, [[most]{.underline}]{.mark} people
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} probably **[[not find the
vision]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a smaller economic system
[[appealing]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is not just a matter of degrowth
being 'a missile word that backfires' because it triggers negative
feelings in people when they first hear it (Drews and Antal, 2016). It
is also a matter of the actual content of the degrowth project.

Two issues in particular should be mentioned in this context. First, for
many, the anti-capitalist sentiments embodied in the degrowth project
will inevitably be a difficult pill to swallow. Today, the vast majority
of people find it almost impossible to conceive of a world without
capitalism. There is a 'widespread sense that not only is capitalism the
only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now
impossible to even imagine a coherent alternative to it' (Fisher, 2009:
2). As Jameson (2003) famously observed, [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark},
in a sense, [[easier to imagine]{.mark} the [end of the world
than]{.mark}]{.underline} it is to imagine the end **[[of
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, not only is degrowth -- like
other anti-capitalist projects -- up against the challenge that most
people consider capitalism the only system that can function; it is also
up against the additional challenge that it speaks against economic
growth in a world where the desirability of growth is considered common
sense.

Second, degrowth is incompatible with the lifestyles to which many of us
who live in rich countries have become accustomed. Economic growth in
the Western world is, to no small extent, premised on the existence of
consumer societies and an associated consumer culture most of us find it
difficult to completely escape. In this culture, social status,
happiness, well-being and identity are linked to consumption (Jackson,
2009). Indeed, it is widely considered a natural right to lead an
environmentally unsustainable lifestyle -- a lifestyle that includes car
ownership, air travel, spacious accommodations, fashionable clothing, an
omnivorous diet and all sorts of electronic gadgets. This Western norm
of consumption has increasingly been exported to other parts of the
world, the result being that never before have so many people taken part
in consumption patterns that used to be reserved for elites (Koch,
2012). If degrowth were to be institutionalised, many citizens in the
rich countries would have to adapt to a materially lower standard of
living. That is, while the basic needs of the global population can be
met in a non-growing economy, not all wants and preferences can be
fulfilled (Koch et al., 2017). Undoubtedly, [[many]{.underline}]{.mark}
people in the rich countries would [[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}
various [[limitations on]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[consumption]{.underline}]{.mark} opportunities
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[violent encroachment
on]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[personal
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, whereas many recognize that
contemporary consumer societies are environmentally unsustainable, fewer
are prepared to actually change their own lifestyles to reverse/address
this.

**[[Several scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** have recently
[[highlighted]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for social conflict
**inherent** in (rapid) social change]{.underline}.]{.mark} For
instance, Maja Göpel (2016: 49) remarks: "Unsurprisingly, the navigation
or [[transition phase in **shifting paradigms**]{.underline}]{.mark} as
well as governance solutions [[is marked by **chaos, politicization,
unease** and power-ridden struggles]{.underline}]{.mark}". Wolfgang
Streeck has issued similar warnings (Streeck et al., 2016: 169). It is
not difficult to see how [[such scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} bear the
potential of [[undermin]{.underline}]{.mark}ing some of the fundamental
**[[conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [[necessary
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[satisfaction of **basic
needs**]{.underline}]{.mark} as discussed above, and hence the danger of
generating substantial wellbeing losses for current and near-future
generations.

In the current context, [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[**difficult** to imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we
**might**]{.underline}]{.mark} be able to [[observe a **rapid** and
**radical** cultural change in which people adopt
identities]{.underline}]{.mark} and related lifestyles [[that
value]{.mark} [intrinsically motivated activities
over]{.mark}]{.underline} pursuing satisfaction and [[**status**
through]{.underline}]{.mark} careers and
**[[consumption]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even more worryingly, political
events in Europe, the United States and elsewhere since the 'Great
Crash' of 2008 indicate that [times of **negative** or **stagnant**
[growth can provide]{.mark} a [**breeding ground** for
**populist**]{.mark}]{.underline}, nationalistic and anti-democratic
**[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Economic
**insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a perceived threat of established
identities through migrants, [[and **deep
mistrust**]{.underline}]{.mark} against 'elite' politicians
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} amongst the main [[**explanations**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} previously unimaginable events such as the
**[[Brexit]{.underline}]{.mark}** vote, **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**
presidency, and recent electoral [[successes for far right-wing parties
in a **range** of European countries]{.underline}.]{.mark}

### Alt\-\--AT: Socialism\-\--2AC

#### Socialism inevitably devolves into [militarization]{.underline} and [oppression]{.underline}.

**Horwitz '15** \[Steven Horwitz, PhD in economics from George Mason
University, served as the Distinguished Professor of Free Enterprise in
the Department of Economics at Ball State University. "Socialism Is War
and War Is Socialism" June 9 2015
https://fee.org/articles/socialism-is-war-and-war-is-socialism/ //vo\]

But there's another side to the story, which is that [[socialism]{.mark}
and economic planning [have a]{.mark} long and **[close
connection]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **[war and
militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As Don Lavoie argues at length in his wonderful and underappreciated
1985 book National Economic Planning: What Is Left?, [any **[attempt to
substitute]{.mark} [economic planning]{.mark}**]{.underline} (whether
comprehensive and central or piecemeal and decentralized) [[for
markets]{.mark} **inevitably [ends]{.mark} [up militarizing]{.mark}
and** regimenting **the society**]{.underline}. Lavoie points out that
this outcome was not an accident. [Much of the literature defending
economic planning worked from a militaristic model. The "success" of
economic planning associated with World War I provided early 20th
century planners with a specific historical model from which to
operate.]{.underline}

This connection should not surprise those who understand the idea of the
market as a spontaneous order. As good economists from Adam Smith to
F.A. Hayek and beyond have appreciated, [markets are the products of
human action but not human design]{.underline}. [No one can consciously
direct an economy]{.underline}. In fact, Hayek in particular argued that
this is true not just of the economy, but of society in general:
advanced commercial societies are spontaneous orders along many
dimensions.

[[Market]{.mark} economies [have no]{.mark} purpose of their
own]{.underline}, or as Hayek put it, they are "ends-independent."
[Markets are simply means by which people come together to pursue the
various ends that each person or group has]{.underline}. You and I don't
have to agree on which goals are more or less important in order to
participate in the market.

The same is true of other spontaneous orders. Consider language. We can
both use English to construct sentences even if we wish to communicate
different, or contradictory, things with the language.

One implication of seeing the economy as a spontaneous order is that it
lacks a "collective purpose." [There is **no [single scale of
values]{.mark}** that guides us as a whole]{.underline}, and there is no
process by which resources, including human resources, can be marshaled
toward those collective purposes.

[**[The absence of]{.mark} such a [collective purpose]{.mark}** or
common scale of values is one factor that **[explains]{.mark} the
[connection between]{.mark} [war and socialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**[They share]{.mark} a [desire to remake]{.mark} the** spontaneous
order of **[society]{.mark} into an organization [with]{.mark} a [single
scale of values]{.mark}**, or a specific purpose. In a war, the
overarching goal of defeating the enemy obliterates the
ends-independence of the market and requires that hierarchical control
be exercised in order to direct resources toward the collective purpose
of winning the war.]{.underline}

[In socialism, the same holds true. **To substitute economic planning
for the market is to** reorganize the economy to **have a single set of
ends** that guides the planners as they allocate resources]{.underline}.
Rather than being connected with each other by a shared set of means, as
in private property, contracts, and market exchange, [planning connects
people by a shared set of ends. Inevitably, **[this will lead to
hierarchy and militarization]{.mark}**, [because]{.mark} those [ends
require]{.mark} trying to **[force people to behave]{.mark} in ways
[that contribute to]{.mark} the ends'
[realization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And as Hayek noted in The Road to
Serfdom, [**[it will]{.mark} also [lead to government using
propaganda]{.mark}** to convince the public to share a set of values
associated with some ends. **We see this tactic in both war and
socialism**.]{.underline}

As Hayek also pointed out, this is an atavistic desire. It is a way for
us to try to recapture the world of our evolutionary past, where we
existed in small, homogeneous groups in which hierarchical organization
with a common purpose was possible. Deep in our moral instincts is a
desire to have the solidarity of a common purpose and to organize
resources in a way that enables us to achieve it.

Socialism and war appeal to so many because they tap into an evolved
desire to be part of a social order that looks like an extended family:
the clan or tribe. Soldiers are not called "bands of brothers" and
socialists don't speak of "a brotherhood of man" by accident. Both
groups use the same metaphor because it works. We are susceptible to it
because most of our history as human beings was in bands of kin that
were largely organized in this way.

[Our desire for solidarity is also why calls for central planning on a
smaller scale have often tried to claim their cause as the moral
equivalent of war]{.underline}. This is true on both the left and right.
[We have had the War on Poverty, the War on Drugs, and the War on
Terror, among others. And we are "fighting," "combating," and otherwise
at war with our supposedly changing climate]{.underline} --- not to
mention those thought to be responsible for that change. [The war
metaphor is the siren song of those who would substitute hierarchy and
militarism for decentralized power and peaceful
interaction.]{.underline}

[Both **[socialism and war are reactionary]{.mark}, not progressive**.
**They are [longings for]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n** evolutionary **[past long
gone]{.mark}**, and **[one]{.mark} in [which humans lived
lives]{.mark}** that were **[far worse]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} those we
live [today]{.mark}. Truly **progressive thinking recognizes the limits
of humanity**]{.underline}'s [ability to consciously construct and
control the social world]{.underline}. It is humble in seeing how social
norms, rules, and institutions that we did not consciously construct
enable us to coordinate the actions of billions of anonymous actors in
ways that enable them to create incredible complexity, prosperity, and
peace.

to set aside half the planet's surface as an undisturbed carbon

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Or as Engels put it in the unfairly maligned and overlooked Dialectics
of Nature: "Animals, as has already been pointed out, change the
environment by their activities in the same way, even if not to the same
extent, as man does, and these changes, as we have seen, in turn react
upon and change those who made them. In nature nothing takes place in
isolation. Everything affects and is affected by every other thing . .
."35 As a species, Homo sapiens are, Engels argued, the product of their
own labor and technology of tools and fire: "The practical discovery of
the conversion of mechanical motion into heat is so very ancient that it
can betaken as dating from the beginning of human history . . . the
making of fire by friction was the first instance of men pressing a
non-living force of nature into their service."36 Further on, Engels
noted how fire led to cooking, which led to profound physical
transformations in the human body: "A meat diet contains in an almost
ready state the most essential ingredients required by the organism for
its metabolism. . . . The most essential effect, however, of a flesh
diet was on the brain, which now received a far richer flow of the
materials necessary for its nourishment and development, and which
therefore could become more rapidly and perfectly developed from
generation to generation. . . . With all respect to the vegetarians, it
has to be recognised that man did not come into existence without a
flesh diet" because cooked meat "further shortened the digestive
process, as it provided the mouth with food already as it were
semidigested." And just "as man learned to consume everything edible, he
learned \[thanks to the warmth of fire\] also to live in any climate. He
spread over the whole of the habitable world, being the only animal that
by its very nature had the power to do so."37 Modern environmental
history has confirmed the importance and ubiquity of the human-fire
relationship. As Stephen J. Pyne, the dean of fire studies, put it in
one of the culminating books in his series on world fire culture, "there
are no known peoples," except some Inuit and Yupik of the icebound far
north, "who do not burn routinely" parts of their landscapes. All over
the world foragers have recognized that berries, mushrooms, bracken,
edible tubers like camas, and wild grasses flourished best on burned
ground, that a light fire exposed acorns and chestnuts, that smoke
deadened bees into a stupor that made honey accessible. Fishers
recognized that torches attracted fish at night, when they could be
easily speared or netted. Hunters saw that evening torches froze deer
and geese, that flames could drive ungulates, that the fresh growth
sprouting on old burns drew grazers, that fires flushed both elusive
prey and dangerous predators from thickets . . . Regular burning,
moreover, retained the desired habitat indefinitely. . . . Surely it is
no accident that Artemis, the ancient goddess of the hunt---with an
ancestry predating the Greeks---held a bow in one hand and a torch in
the other.38 Very often this so-called broadcast burning creates quite
fecund ecologies. Geoff Cunfer offers an impressive example in Bison and
People on the Northern Great Plains: "On the northern plains, Village
Indians developed a spring and fall burning cycle designed, in part, to
manage bison . . . acre by acre, over several hundred years, Indians
reworked the plains landscape" to enlarge the grassland, "converting
millions of acres of forest to prairie." And by this environment making,
"they increased bison populations to all-time highs, estimated at
twenty-nine million by 1700."39

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

The larger point is this: [[we **cannot retreat** from our role]{.mark}
as environment makers. [Humans have always been remaking the
planet]{.mark}. Unfortunately, [under **industrial capitalism**]{.mark},
we do so as **reckless, marauding somnambulants**]{.underline}. [[We
will destroy ourselves]{.mark} as a result, [or we will become]{.mark}
self-conscious, deliberate, life-producing, and **[life-enhancing

Limits and Cynicism

A state-led crash program of CDR would only be meaningful within the
context of a broader program of radical mitigation involving euthanizing
the fossil fuel industry, a massive clean energy build-out, and robust
adaptation efforts like coastal defense.

Pursued in isolation, CDR would do little to stabilize the climate
system and could be used to justify inaction on the emissions reduction
front. As it is, the promise of CDR is central to the myth of "clean
coal." One could imagine the fossil energy sectors line if CDR were
brought to scale: "No need to stop burning fossil fuel; we are stripping
out so much CO2!" Most current CCS is used by the oil industry.

Even if we could stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels, there is still the
problem of ocean acidification and spreading anoxia, both of which might
bring down the human species. Despite potential problems with CDR,
movements must demand that states embrace it and drive its mass
adaptation. As Lackner put it, "Throwing a life-preserver to a drowning
victim may not assure a successful rescue, but it is not a high-stakes
gamble. Offering the life-preserver is preferable to withholding it,
even though it might reduce the victim's incentive for learning how to
swim."40

That sort of [[desperate optimism]{.underline}]{.mark} has much to
recommend it. For one thing, it [can help [roll back]{.mark} the
**[debilitating pessimism]{.mark}** that comes with **actually
understanding** climate science]{.underline}. Indeed, [a major though
largely unacknowledged problem among environmentalists is
**cynicism**]{.underline}.41 [Anyone who comprehends the **basic
implications** of climate science is forced to realize that climate
change is **unfolding in a nonlinear fashion** in which the causes build
while the effects lag]{.underline}. When the effects do begin to kick
in, they will most likely do so with rapidly mounting intensity. Worse
yet, half of all anthropogenic GHG emissions have occurred since 1990.
Despite recent years of slowed emissions growth, the causes continue to
build in exponential fashion. We are headed toward an extremely
dangerous future. Knowing this, it is hard not to lapse into cynicism.
Why struggle when the situation is so clearly hopeless? But if we do not
struggle, then all is surely lost. In a book of conversations with
international intellectuals, Fidel Castro addressed this problem: "If
you knew that the world is going to last for ten years only, it is your
duty to struggle and do something in those ten years. If somebody tells
you, 'You can be certain that the planet is going to disappear and this
thinking species is going to be extinct,' what would you do? Sit down
and cry? I think we must struggle, and that's what we have always
done. . . . that is what I suggest that we do, and not let ourselves be
overtaken by pessimism."42

[The [failure of environmentalists to propose plans that **credibly
stand up** to]{.mark} scrutiny in the face of [climate science
produces]{.mark} a **lack of confidence**, [despair]{.mark}, and
cynicism. Outright [rejection of]{.mark} big [tech]{.mark}nology
**[feeds cynicism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, in an article
rejecting CDR, an organizer with the (generally very worthy) Leap
Manifesto wrote, "I myself have a very simple mantra: If Exxon is
involved with something, it can't be good for our planet." [ExxonMobil
studies geology, but [we don't reject]{.mark} geology just because they
**misuse it**. Nor do we reject [railroads]{.mark} simply [because the
**Nazis used railroads**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly with CDR, [the
[misuse]{.mark} of it [by fossil fuel corp]{.mark}oration[s is **not a
legitimate basis**]{.mark} upon which [to reject it]{.mark}. A [radical
approach to tech]{.mark}nology [requires]{.mark} neither embrace nor
rejection but rather **[thinking through the
contradictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Alt\-\--AT: Central Planning\-\--2AC

#### Central Planning empirically [fails]{.underline}; [only]{.underline} free markets sustain economic growth.

**Palmer '15** (Tom G. Palmer, holds a doctorate in politics from Oxford
University, George M. Yeager Chair for Advancing Liberty and executive
vice president for International Programs at Atlas Network. "Why
socialism\'s central planning inevitably fails" May 13 2015
https://www.atlasnetwork.org/articles/why-socialisms-central-planning-inevitably-fails
//vo)

[**[State socialism was]{.mark} one of the [dominant]{.mark} government
forces** of the 20th century, and although the world is not completely
rid of it yet, the late 1980s and early 1990s brought a dramatic and
sudden change]{.underline} with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Tom G. Palmer, Atlas Network's
executive vice president for international programs, talked about the
history and ideology of socialism in his keynote address at the 2014
Ludwig von Mises 6th Annual Celebration Dinner, made available online
this month.

In his remarks, Palmer delves into history, economics, and sociology,
and brings to bear his own decades of experience spreading the ideas of
liberty while he traveled both behind the Iron Curtain and within
post-Soviet nations that had varying degrees of success moving forward
from their centrally planned pasts.

"[[People forget]{.mark} [how **rapid the transformation**]{.mark}
[was]{.mark}]{.underline}," Palmer observes. "We talk about the fall of
the Berlin Wall, and how surprised many people were by it, most notably
the communists."

Palmer notes that [the [socialist officials]{.mark} of East Germany
[were **confident about**]{.mark} **the [staying]{.mark} power** of
their regime **[right up to]{.mark} the point that it
[collapse]{.mark}d**]{.underline}. In January 1989, Erich Honecker, who
was general secretary of the Socialist Unity Party and led East Germany
for 18 years before the Berlin Wall fell, declared that "The Wall will
be standing in 50 and even in 100 years," and in October 1989, only one
month before the wall fell, said that "Neither an ox nor a donkey is
able to stop the progress of socialism."

Palmer explains how [economist Ludwig von Mises identified [the
**economic calculation**]{.mark} **[problem inherent in
socialism]{.mark}**, and why **[the impossibility of determining
prices]{.mark} [without free markets]{.mark} [leads to]{.mark}** the
**[inevitable failure]{.mark}** of the centralized planning of an
economy]{.underline}

He also delves into a key disagreement between two other economists in
the Austrian tradition. [Joseph Schumpeter]{.underline}, although not a
socialist himself, [believed that a socialist society could possibly
achieve economic growth through central planning]{.underline} as long as
it devoted enough brilliant mathematicians and economists to figuring
out accurate prices and production values.

[Nobel laureate economist Friedrich A. Hayek, on the other hand, pointed
out that Schumpeter was entirely incorrect. **[No amount of
ingenuity]{.mark}** at the center [**can calculate value** for
people]{.mark} throughout society --- **[not even with]{.mark}**
**[all]{.mark} the [computing power]{.mark} in the world** devoted to
the task]{.underline}

"[**[The]{.mark} practical [problem]{.mark}**, however,
**[arises]{.mark}** precisely [because]{.mark} these [facts]{.mark} [are
never]{.mark} so [given to a single]{.mark} [mind]{.mark}, and because,
in consequence, it is necessary that in the solution of the problem
knowledge should be used that is dispersed among many
people]{.underline}," Hayek wrote in his 1945 essay "The Use of
Knowledge in Society." [**[Information about dispersed values can't be
obtained]{.mark}** because it's held inside the minds of millions of
people, and **[not revealed]{.mark}** [until]{.mark} they make their
**[competing preferences known through market
transactions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"**[The [economic problem requires those prices]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
Palmer explains in his lecture. "[Prices that are established in the
messy higgling and haggling of the market, of going in and offering
less, and the merchant wants more, and you come to a price you can agree
on."]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--AT: Psychoanalysis\-\--2AC

capitalist realism

Here is where the psychoanalytic critique is at its most profound. The
staying power of historical capitalism---the reason why capitalist
realism is likely to remain confined to historical capitalism and not
pass over into historical communism, or better still, [[the reason why
we are **unlikely** to pass over to]{.mark} **historical
[communism]{.mark}** anytime soon]{.underline} (even, and indeed
especially, to 'fully automated luxury communism'), [despite the fact
that it might seal the deal for **CR**]{.underline} insofar as it would
be the most perfect actualisation of the 'will to difference' that is so
neatly aligned with the structure of desiring subjectivity---[[is
explained]{.mark} less [by the way]{.mark} in which [capitalism]{.mark}
maximises the possibilities for success and far more by the way in which
it **[manages failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If we accept that the
existence of the Other as an a priori structure of subjectivity is
constituted by its inscrutability, inattentiveness, errancy, etc., and
correlatively that there can never be any question of fully and finally
solving the riddle of the Other's wandering and fickle desire, it
follows that [the [only]{.mark} form of [enjoyment fully open to the
subject is]{.mark} the **enjoyment of the promise**
itself]{.underline}---[that desire, as [investment in a promise that can
**never be kept**]{.mark}, is its own form of enjoyment]{.underline}.
From this we can conclude that the main problem around which the
organisation of social life turns under capitalism is not one of
realising the impossible so much as one of maintaining the promise as
such as continually worthy of libidinal investment. In getting what we
want, [in acquiring the objects of desire, we **invariably fail** to get
'It', whatever brings us in proximity to 'the Thing'; what is called
'communism' is predicated on the wager that the trauma of this failure
is **always more than offset** by the promise embodied in the
**thing-to-come**]{.underline}, that the flow of desire can always be
sustained by the ceaseless production of the new tout court. [[In
truth]{.mark}, however, **[there is no warrant for this]{.mark}**.
[Constant failure is **painful**]{.mark} and
**debilitating**]{.underline}. To acquire an object only to discover
that it was not what it seemed, that its allure was concealing a void,
that whatever was sought within it had already slipped away, that the
whole business was a fool's errand---[to repeat this farce time and
again exacts a **heavy psychical toll** on the subject, one that far
[outstrips the power of the promise]{.mark} itself]{.underline}. To
sustain the promise, then, requires that objects of desire be put out of
reach even while they are never rendered totally and permanently
inaccessible. In other words, [[objects of desire must be made
**contingently inaccessible**]{.mark}, in such a way that [we]{.mark}
can [fail to get them]{.mark}, but always [for **non-essential
reasons**]{.mark}. This is what McGowan is getting at when he says that
we 'enjoy our failure']{.underline}; the point is not that failure as
such is enjoyable, but rather that [failure is the **a priori
condition** of the only kind of enjoyment possible for us, namely, the
**anticipatory**, **purely virtual enjoyment** of libidinally
[investing]{.mark} ourselves [in a future]{.mark}, final enjoyment [that
can **never arrive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Capitalism, of course, has any number of such obstacles or
'contradictions' that make our failure to get the Thing seem at once
**inevitable and accidental**]{.underline}. Capitalism does not simply
give us what we desire, what lures us on with the promise that it will
be 'It'---for then the promise would quickly be exposed as a cruel lie
and desire would have its legs cut out from under it. But neither does
capitalism simply deny, constrict, or repress desire as Marcuse et al.
maintained. Instead, and in perfect accordance with its 'concept',
[[capitalism erects **one barrier after another**]{.mark} to our
appropriating the inexhaustible cornucopia of objects it dangles out in
front of us [and]{.mark}, in so doing, [**sustains desire** by keeping
the promise in **constant circulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not
merely that there is always something new coming around the bend, but
that our inability to tap and exploit this inexhaustible wellspring of
novelty is always somehow the fault of the system itself. [We love and
hate the system in **equal measure**---or more precisely, the fact that
the system gives us a reason to hate it is **essential** to why we love
it]{.underline}. Nothing more perfectly dovetails with the contradictory
status of the subject as ontologically oriented vis-à-vis something it
can never have than the irrationality of capitalism as a regime of
production which is doomed to withhold from the vast majority of workers
the abundant fruits of their own labour. [It is precisely this
**irrationality** that **comforts us** by allowing us to **keep
indulging** in the phantasy that 'It' must be out there somewhere, in
that vast ocean of difference]{.underline}---if only... ('True, I don't
have "It" yet, but that's because the system is so broken, rigged,
unfair...') [So far from being **internal limits** that threaten to
bring the whole system crashing to the ground, [capitalism's
contradictions are]{.mark} in fact [the **secret to its
longevity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The persistence of [CR]{.mark} at the level of historical capitalism is
[thus]{.mark} a manifestation of the **Freudian death-drive**. This, of
course, has nothing to do with any will to perish but rather [points
to]{.mark} an [**unconscious propensity to self-destruction**, even when
the alt]{.mark}ernative [is]{.mark} **demonstrably
[preferable]{.mark}**]{.underline} (for no one could deny that, in terms
of certain objectively measurable indicators, we would all be better off
under FALC as compared with the mess we're dealing with at present). By
absolving us of any need or responsibility to 'traverse the phantasy'
and face the hard truth that there is no 'It' to get in the first place,
[capitalism traps us in cycle of **compulsive behaviour** that now
threatens to destroy the **very conditions** of civilised existence, if
not life itself. The problem is that]{.underline}, despite this fact,
[nothing would be more **psychically traumatic** for the subject than
the phantasy-world of 'everything, everywhere, all at once']{.underline}
(and for everyone) that FALC represents, [because nothing else would so
**violently and mercilessly** destroy the world, built on the foundation
of the promise, in which the subject is **most libidinally at
home**]{.underline}.

## Framework

### Framework\-\--No Subjectivity Shift\-\--2AC

#### Debate doesn't shape subjectivities, debaters [double down]{.underline} and alt causes [overwhelm]{.underline}.

**Lubrano '25** (Sarah Stein Lubrano, DPhil University of Oxford in
Political theory "This article won't change your mind. Here's why" May
18 2025
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/18/change-mind-evidence-arguing-social-relationships
//vo)

[There are lots of reasons why **[debate]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and
indeed, information-giving [**and argumentation** in
general]{.underline}) [**[tends to be ineffective]{.mark}** **[at
changing]{.mark}** people's **political [beliefs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Cognitive dissonance]{.underline}, a phenomenon I studied as part of my
PhD research[, is one]{.underline}. [This is the often unconscious
psychological discomfort we feel when faced with contradictions in our
own beliefs or actions]{.underline}, and it has been well documented. We
can see cognitive dissonance and its effects at work when people rapidly
"reason" in ways that are really attempts to mitigate their discomfort
with new information about strongly held beliefs. For example, before
Trump was convicted of various charges in 2024, only 17% of Republican
voters believed felons should be able to be president; directly after
his conviction, that number rose to 58%. To reconcile two contradictory
beliefs (that presidents shouldn't do x, and that Trump should be
president), an enormous number of Republican voters simply changed their
mind about the former. In fact, Republican voters shifted their views on
more or less all the things Trump had been convicted of: fewer felt it
was immoral to have sex with a porn star, pay someone to stay silent
about an affair, or falsify a business record. Nor is this effect
limited to Trump voters: [[research suggests]{.mark} **[we]{.mark} all
[rationalise]{.mark}** in this way, **[in order to hold on to]{.mark}
the [beliefs]{.mark}** that let us keep operating as we have been. Or,
ironically, to change some of our beliefs in response to new
information, but often only in order to not have to sacrifice other
strongly held beliefs]{.underline}.

But it's not just psychological phenomena like cognitive dissonance that
make debates and arguments relatively ineffective. As I lay out in my
book, [probably the most important reason words don't change minds is
that two [other **factors**]{.mark} **[carry]{.mark} far [more
influence]{.mark}**: our **social [relationships]{.mark}**;
**[and]{.mark} our own actions** and
**[experiences]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

A sea of evidence demonstrates that [**our [friends]{.mark}** have the
power to **[change]{.mark} our [beliefs]{.mark} and
behaviour**]{.underline} -- not by arguing with us, but simply by being
around us or showing us new ways of living. Studies on social contact
theory show that [when people are set up in conditions to become friends
and collaborate, they become less prejudiced against the identity groups
their new friends belong to]{.underline}. This phenomenon probably
explains many of the advances in gay rights over the past few decades:
as people came out, their friends changed their views on homosexuality,
resulting in one of the fastest ever recorded shifts in public opinion.
Similarly, research shows people are most likely to engage in
climate-friendly action (such as installing a heat pump), if their
friends do -- far more likely than if they are given cash rewards or
other kinds of incentives. Our friends broaden our field of concern;
they get us involved in the world, and they build the trust that human
beings appear to require to open up to new ideas. [Their **[indirect
influence]{.mark}** **[achieves more than arguments]{.mark}**,
[especially]{.mark} [from strangers]{.mark}, ever could. In other words:
when it comes to persuasion, it's not the conversation, it's the
relationship.]{.underline}

[Our actions and experiences also have a profound effect]{.underline},
albeit often in counterintuitive ways. For example, research shows that
in otherwise similar conditions, women turned away from having an
abortion become somewhat less in favour of abortion rights, while women
granted an abortion become somewhat more in favour. We might expect
those denied would become more passionate about access, but apparently
not -- probably because, in part [**[due to cognitive
dissonance]{.mark}**, **[people]{.mark}** tend to **[bring]{.mark} their
[beliefs towards their actions]{.mark}**, even if those actions are
compelled. The influence of actions and experiences on belief systems is
also evident when it comes to climate crisis]{.underline}: those who
experience intense climate-related weather events are more likely to
believe in climate change and in addressing it.

[Compared with these influences, **[arguments]{.mark} alone
[have]{.mark} comparatively [little power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet
our institutions are still shaped as though words were enough. We're
infrastructurally, collectively trapped in the liberal belief that
politics is mostly about talking, then sporadically voting. What's
needed by anyone hoping to promote progressive ideas is not arguments,
but an infrastructure that fosters new relationships and experiences.
This could look like anything from a waiting area for parents to mingle
before school lets out, to a workplace union, to a public park. These
forms of infrastructure allow people to relate and act in new ways,
building friendships and trust, and encouraging the actions that
ultimately allow people to change their political views.

### Framework\-\--Clash\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Clash turns the K\-\--you can\'t [recruit people]{.underline} if you can\'t [convince them]{.underline}.

吳

This means that [[socialist groups can't recruit]{.mark} and hold new
[members on]{.mark} the basis of **[hyped-up agitational
rhetoric]{.mark}**. New [recruits]{.mark}, if they are to remain
**actively involved**]{.underline} and be confident to recruit other
people, [[have to be]{.mark} politically [convinced through **serious
discussion**]{.mark}, political branch meetings and reading groups,
combined [with]{.mark} well [**thought-out interventions** into]{.mark}
whatever [struggles and debates]{.mark} that arise]{.underline}. To cope
during this challenging political period, socialists need to maintain a
regular pattern of activity which takes up all the issues of the day and
at the same time remain alert to intervene whenever a new radicalising
struggle blows up. To achieve this they need to develop an understanding
amongst their members that when important opportunities for growth open
up they have to move decisively to seize them. Socialists have to always
be looking for new struggles and new people. But [[socialists]{.mark}
also [have to raise their **theoretical level** so]{.mark} that [they
are capable of]{.mark} both [responding to]{.mark} whatever **political
[debates]{.mark}** arise and of adapting to the ups and downs and quiet
patches of political life [without becoming
**demoralised**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Framework\-\--AT: Capitalist Realism\-\--2AC

#### 'Capitalist realism' is [incoherent]{.underline} as an argument\-\--a [full exploration]{.underline} of Fisher's theory concludes we should have [already reached]{.underline} communism.

**Jorn 24** \[Assistant Professor, PhD, Philosophy, Japan International

Critique", Tsukuba Gakuin University,
https://www.japan-iu.ac.jp/library/kiyou/2024/03_Jorn.pdf\] 吳 \*\*CR =
capitalist realism

[At first glance]{.underline}, the **[[psychoanalytic
account]{.underline}]{.mark}** sketched above [seems to [provide an
**adequate**]{.mark} **theoretical [explanation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
the problem of [capitalist realism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Why can't we
envision a life beyond capitalism?]{.underline} Why does capitalism seem
like the final horizon of all thought and action and the 'end of
history'? Answer: [because [capitalism plugs into **psychical
subjectivity**]{.mark} in the most profound way, [at the level
of]{.mark} the very being of [the subject]{.mark} itself [as a **subject
of desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In place of a world of things,
capitalism substitutes a world of currents and pathways, an infinitely
complex and tangled circuitry to house the promise, with things being
little more than fungible nodes whose sole function is to charge desire
by giving it something to surge through on its way to something else. No
sooner has one candidate for 'It' failed to deliver on the promise than
another rises up to take its place. [Psychoanalysis therefore posits not
that capitalism is merely something we are ontologically susceptible
to---something we stumbled into by **historical accident** and thus
might have avoided under **different circumstances**---but instead, and
more problematically, that capitalism is [something we
are]{.mark}]{.underline} (to use a fashionable idiom) **[[ontologically
'hard-wired' for]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Capitalism, in other words, is
what Heidegger would call our destiny, not in the sense that it was sent
from on high or written in the stars (destiny is not fate), but in the
sense that for beings ontologically constituted such as we are--- i.e.,
for subjects---an eventual reckoning with desire, and with the
consequences of our reconfiguring the world in accordance with desire,
was inevitable from the beginning.

[Against all appearances, however, [this]{.mark} account [is]{.mark}
precisely what **[challenges]{.mark} the [thesis of capitalist
realism]{.mark}** from the ground up]{.underline}. Why? For the simple
reason that [the [political 'impossible]{.mark}' which we are supposed
to be able just barely to glimpse through the **cracks and
fissures**]{.underline} in the monolithic edifice of CR [[is invariably
described as a]{.mark} form of **[communism]{.mark}** that, in its main
features, is not only **formally identical** to capitalism but indeed
nothing more than the phantasy of capitalism, [a]{.mark} kind of
**[utopic 'capitalism without contradictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}'. I
think McGowan is correct in his analysis here, and all one has to do is
consult texts such as Aaron Bastani's Fully Automated Luxury Communism12
to understand why. [The political premise of such texts is the promotion
of a form of social and politico-economic organisation which in point of
fact is not really so hard to glimpse at all]{.underline} (as evidenced
by the numerous mainstream publications that endorsed Bastani's central
'FALC' thesis), [namely, a kind of **hyper-technological**,
**ultra-efficient**, and **maximally sustainable AI-managed capitalism**
on steroids]{.underline}. Put in other words, while CR takes issue with
capitalism in, to use a Bataillean distinction, a 'restricted' sense,
i.e., as an historically given and contingent politico-economic system
characterised by certain concrete relations, tendencies, contradictions,
dangers, etc., [[psychoanalysis]{.mark} in contrast [focuses on
capital]{.mark}ism in a more 'general' sense, i.e., [as a logic of
productive life]{.mark} überhaupt which is [**independent** of]{.mark}
any particular **[politico-economic
configuration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it is the insights of the
latter approach that seriously call into question those of the former.
[For if the psychoanalytic critique holds true at the level of the
**logic of production** of capitalist society
generally]{.underline}---[namely, the ever-expanding and self-valorising
production of what we might call
'surplus-difference']{.underline}---[then there is **no obvious reason**
why we should remain trapped in **one historically specific
politico-economic form** in which this logic gets expressed]{.underline}
(e.g., that of a bellum omnium contra omnes waged between private owners
of production to exploit labour, maximise profit, capture state power,
etc.).

To be clear, this is not intended as a critique of 'communism', whatever
that may be, as an ideal; such a critique may or may not be called for,
but it is not what is at stake here. The broader point is this: that
insofar as this is true---insofar as [what is called
'communism']{.underline} (as the hitherto impossible but now glimpsable
future beyond the cracked horizon of capitalism) [is in essence
**indistinguishable** from the fulfilment of the **promise of
capitalism** itself]{.underline}---the thesis of capitalist realism is
immediately thrown into doubt. For if CR in a more fundamental sense
refers not merely to the way in which certain contingent factors (such
as ideology) prevent us from realising the transformation of historical
capitalism into a system in which the productive forces are channelled
toward the more emancipatory end of universal and unlimited abundance
(via mechanisms of communal ownership, socialised profit, etc.), but
rather to the way in which the ever-growing production of surplus
difference feeds into the most basic structural dynamics of desiring
subjectivity---if this is true, then what we see is not only that
[[communism]{.mark}, so [far from being the]{.mark} **inversion** or
[**antithesis** of capitalism, is]{.mark} merely [the **phantasy of its
fulfilment** and full actualisation]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also, and
for that very reason, that [[there is **no**]{.mark} **compelling
[reason]{.mark}** [for our **utter failure** to transition]{.mark} away
from historical capitalism into this purportedly **more humane** and
**sustainable** form of life]{.underline}. In other words, [if the
psychoanalytic critique makes us sceptical of the kind of
Enlightenment-based, **pedagogically oriented** utopianism of
CR]{.underline} (one whereby popular mobilisation is predicated on a
scandalising genealogical exposure of the base origins of our current
epidemic of apathy, depressive hedonia, hard cynicism...), [this is in
part because the more general account it offers of the **deeper
ontological resonances** between political economy and libidinal economy
effectively makes CR]{.underline}, as a restricted thesis about the
intransigence of a given form of capitalism,
**[incoherent]{.underline}**. For even if CR is correct about this
intransigence, as it certainly is---i.e., we really do seem to be at the
'end of history' in the sense that there are no universally shared
alternatives to capitalist democracy on the horizon---[[it remains
**incomprehensible** why]{.mark} our [**deeper psychical attachment**
to]{.mark} the concept of [capital does not **override**]{.mark} our
**ideological [interpellation]{.mark}** [as capitalist subjects]{.mark}
in the narrower sense]{.underline}---why, in short, we do not see
through capital's shenanigans and work together to start realising a
world that is even more in tune with the structural workings of desiring
subjectivity than the present one. Simply put: if capitalism is so
seductive precisely because it keeps desire in a state of perpetual
motion due to its seemingly infinite capacity for the production of
novelty and difference, and if what is called 'communism' merely takes
this to its logico-historical conclusion (qua utopia of difference
without contradiction via a techno-politics that secures safe, limitless
abundance for all), then whence capitalist realism? Why aren't we all
chomping at the bit to realise this 'communism' which---we are
told---would exceed the capitalism of our wildest dreams? [[If the
alt]{.mark}ernative [is so psychically enticing, **why aren't we already
there?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Framework\-\--AT: Political Imaginaries\-\--1AR

#### The neg's 'political imaginary' is nothing more than a [hollow fantasy]{.underline} that precludes the realization of actual, material change. Revolutionary struggles [must]{.underline} grapple with the [unknowability]{.underline} of a post-capitalist future and create tangible alternatives.

[Today\'s [utopias are]{.mark}]{.underline} much the same. They are
buried in the blue glow of screens that look like windows but are
something less. We have seen breathtaking cathedrals built in Minecraft.
We have wandered in melancholy worship through the \"liminal spaces\" of
urbex vloggers and backrooms forums. We have felt the sublime warmth of
Miyazaki and the solarpunk imageboard. Sometimes, we can even pretend
that distant locales offer something more substantial: the Lacandon
Jungle, Rojava, Cuba, even the Pyongyang of the propaganda poster (at
that perfect aesthetic midpoint between Stalin and Wes Anderson). But
for most of us these \"real places\" remain images, unmuddied by the
murk and blood of material struggle. Like the soft blue glow, they are
an intimate coldness. [**[Cosplay, rather than
politics]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Closer to home, [desperation]{.underline} even [might push us to
\"envision real utopias\" in any **marginal glimmer** of
communality]{.underline}: the noble Wikipedia editor, [the worker
cooperative]{.underline} competing on the global market, [the sharing of
food]{.underline} at the protest camp, the persistence of the public
library despite the endless assault of privatization, the urban garden
tended by the six-figure NGO executive, the sharing of cigarettes near
the dumpsters behind the kitchen, [or simply the commonplace care work
that knits us to family and friends. To imagine that such things are
somehow the germ of communism would be **a joke if it was not so
tragic**.]{.underline} Like someone who believes that the window
projected onto the wall is the real thing. [[The bleak reality is that
none of us have]{.mark} ever [seen]{.mark} even [the **dimmest glimmer
of a communist world**]{.mark}---at most we have witnessed a few of
those [weightless moments]{.mark} when many people realize at once that
our world can, in fact, be broken.]{.underline} Ultimately, [these [are
**nothing but glowing images** best seen from a
distance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reach out to touch them and there is no
depth. Just work, survival, desperation. Just the drywall, offwhite. [In
the course of these same years where every summer seems to be the
hottest ever, where the storms dance deadly across our cities like
drunken gods, and where, despite everything getting worse, [every
insurrection has been decisively **strangled in the name** of]{.mark}
that same old **[status quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}---it is hardly a
coincidence that there has also been a proliferation of new
\"political\" attempts to sketch out detailed utopias, attempting to
answer the question of \"what does communism look like?\" or \"how would
a socialist society operate?\" [The [proliferation]{.mark} and
popularity [of]{.mark}]{.underline} these **[[utopian
fantasies]{.underline}]{.mark}** at least [[demonstrates]{.mark} that
many **[hunger for that next world]{.mark}** imprisoned in this
one]{.underline}, if only they could free it. And, in this
sense, [the]{.underline} production and refinement of these fictions at
first seems to serve some sort of political purpose. This is often
the [justification offered by their authors]{.underline}, at
least. [Even if ideas in and of themselves cannot generate historical
change, we might presume that political imaginaries can help us to
\"orient\" activity in some fashion.]{.underline} 2 If we take this
claim as given, then the diversity of these utopias would thereby act as
expression for concrete political differences. In other words, these
fictions would don the garb of \"strategy,\" and each microgenre would
then serve as its own \"orientation\" around which a more practical
politics might cohere.

[But [the reality is that the **suppression of open class conflict**
throughout society]{.mark}]{.underline} ---combined with the generally
low level of hands-on knowledge of production induced by
deindustrialization---[[has tended to **impoverish the
practical**]{.mark} **or functional [aspect of \"political
thought\"]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} general and of [discourse and
imagination]{.mark} in particular. The result is that most signals
of apparent political or strategic difference are in fact little more
than an index of the tastes, aesthetics, and desires prioritized by
different authors and audiences occupying their different subcultural
niches in the **cavernous marketplace**. Today\'s [utopias]{.mark}
therefore operate over an enormous breadth: ranging from hyperbolic
tales of the permanently embarrassed futurist]{.underline} (\"fully
automated luxury communism\"), to planning schema that would channel
resources and populations at the behest of aspiring technocrats
(\"half-earth socialism,\" \"degrowth communism\"), [to folksier
fairytales of city-scale \"communes\"]{.underline} popping up like
little mushrooms of self-organization in the interstices of society or
under the umbrella of insurrection. Some of the more fanciful visions
will contain the occasional moment of lucidity, while others are wholly
detached from reality.

[Despite their apparent divergences, all tend to operate according to
a shared logic that is utopian not because it is imaginative but because
**it [lack]{.mark}s [any real substance or
depth]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Though their forms seem multifarious, such
stories cast a single shadow onto that same flat surface, off-white. In
other words, [these utopias are unified less by the positive content of
the worlds that they envision than by the fact that they all share the
same glaring absences etched onto the same fictive flatness: first and
foremost, [we find the **absence of \"politics\"**]{.mark}
itself, [in]{.mark} the sense of [some **strategic sequence of
struggle**]{.mark} stretched [between the immediate world and the
envisioned utopia]{.mark}]{.underline}---after all, \"utopia\" is a
non-place not because it cannot be envisioned but because no path can be
stretched from here to there; [and second, [we find]{.mark} negative
[imprints left by **questions that**]{.mark} all such **[utopias refuse
to ask]{.mark}**. How, exactly, will production of anything other than
simple handicrafts be conducted at both the social and technical
level]{.underline} (without deferring to the magical fix of \"direct
democracy\" and \"full automation\"). [Or: [how might]{.mark} such [a
system ari]{.mark}se not despite but [through the]{.mark} inherently
uneven and **[disorderly revolutionary process]{.mark}** itself? This is
[a]{.mark} selective [refusal of rigor]{.mark} that]{.underline}, at
best, arises when authors use familiar or commonsense notions to paper
over their failures of imagination and, at worst, [serves to
[disguise **the reactionary impulse** that
haunts the **utopian imagination**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
sense, [such [utopias compose]{.mark}]{.underline} what philosopher Emil
Cioran referred to as [[an \"**idolatry of tomorrow**,\" in which
the]{.mark} very [attempt to dream up the future]{.mark} in all its
detail \"[blocks our ability to have a future]{.mark} at
all.\" 3]{.underline}

One might be tempted here to then equate the \"utopian\" with any
fictive or imaginative approach to politics and then contrast it to a
\"scientific\" alternative understood to be concerned purely with
matters of practice and critique. But this does not really make sense.
The imaginative, aesthetic, literary, inventive, and intuitive
dimensions of politics---however intellectually shallow or fashionably
pretentious ---ultimately take on an outsize influence in the
construction of popular power. It does not matter how correct or
critical your analysis is if no one is attracted to it in the first
place. And this attraction is not a logical thing, nor is it a process
of careful argument or enlightened discourse and debate. Thought occurs
first through affect and analogy---through the crass calculus of the
vibe rather than the immaculate mathematics of the mind. [The problem
with the utopia]{.underline}, then, is not that it is science fiction.
Its fictive power is precisely why utopia is able to wield such a
disproportionate force in the political imagination and therefore why
the artful production of attractive aesthetics and imaginative worlds
will be essential to the practical construction of any political
project. The problem [is]{.underline} instead [that most utopias are
not]{.underline} actually science fiction---or, at least, not \"hard\"
science fiction, [distinguishable from fantasy for its efforts to take
the physical world seriously.]{.underline}

In other words, [what makes these [fictive endeavors]{.mark} \"utopian\"
in the bad sense is that they are not treated as **rigorous
experiments** of imagination that must align, at least in certain
fundamental features, with the material limits of our reality, and [must
accord]{.mark}, in some feasible way, with [**realistic presumptions**
about the **path of political conflict**]{.mark} that would stretch from
here to there.]{.underline} Nor are these thought experiments committed
to anything like a scientific methodology---dissolving \"common sense\"
appearances with the corrosive force of critical inquiry. [They
[are]{.mark} [instead **largely uncritical**]{.mark}, taking the
immediate (and inherently alienated) appearance of the world at face
value.]{.underline} Rather than science fiction, then, [they are
something more like magical realism, mirroring reality in the
exaggerated form of a fable. These utopias therefore act
as]{.underline} what Lenin called a \"wish that can never come true,\"
or, more pointedly, [\"a wish that is not based on social forces and is
not supported by the growth and development of political, class
forces.\" [The problem is **not** that they are imaginative]{.mark} or
fanciful]{.underline}---that they express a wish for the future--- [[but
that **there is nothing behind them that could make the wish come
true**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Their aesthetics do not link to any
substantial, scientific critique of how capitalist society actually
operates and their feats of imagination do not attempt to think through
the very real problems of---social, technical,
ecological---reconfiguration that will plague any attempt to break this
world and build another. There is no thundering green forest beyond the
window, only the same old drywall, off-white.

What, then, would a truly scientific alternative look like? We offer a
practical example below, constructed according to the basic negative
principle underlying scientific inquiry more generally: that any such
account must foreground both the unknown and the unknowable. It is
simply disingenuous to pretend that a communist world could easily be
envisioned by individuals whose entire experiential context is that of
capitalist society. Even if we might be able to sketch out some of the
technical or social preconditions needed for such a world to emerge,
this world would be fundamentally alien to us. [Many utopias prove cheap
not just for their lack of complexity or depth, but because they pretend
that the people composing a future society will all be basically the
same sort as those that compose the current one, carrying with them the
same predilections, passions, and proficiencies.]{.underline} In other
words, we find a colloquial communism, [inhabited by people who are just
like you or me---**this new world** the same as our present one, only
better.]{.underline}

Against this, we would instead emphasize that a communist revolution is,
fundamentally, an anthropological revolution. This means that [it is
genuinely [difficult to understand]{.mark} what [a better world would
look like **at the quotidian level**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} because
such a world would also reshape those who inhabit it. The identifiable
material and social prerequisites of this world (such as and end to
scarcity in all essentials, ecological rehabilitation, and
non-domination) would enable the blooming of new cultures and lifeways
that are difficult or impossible for us to fully imagine. [This
difficulty is not due to the complexity or advanced nature of such
a society. After all, we run into the same basic problem when trying to
grasp what life was like in ancient social orders that were, at least in
the technical sense, much simpler than our own. Whether looking forward
or backward, our anthropological lifeworld imposes ideological limits on
the imagination.]{.underline} We are broken creatures, our minds bound
by the very social constraints that we seek to eliminate. And, while the
anthropologist can at least go and observe the unfamiliar lifeways of
other cultures and the archeologist can examine the remains of their
material existence, the communist is faced with the more difficult
dilemma posed by an \"other\" that is not just culturally distant but
also decisively locked beyond our sight in the forward-flow of time,
with not even the faintest of archeological fragments from which we
might reconstruct the whole.

Below, we therefore offer a practical fiction rooted in a negative
critique. Throughout, we will counterpose our account to what we think
are common errors that plague the political imaginary while emphasizing
the inherent unknowability and dynamic cultural efflorescence of a
communist world. While the contrast between practical fiction and
negative critique may seem paradoxical---an antiutopian utopia---such a
procedure is the nature of scientific inquiry. As in any scientific
inquiry, the models that we pose here are ultimately makeshift. But,
without any ability to directly observe or experiment, a certain degree
of fictive rigor is essential in their construction. [[Imagination must
be subject to]{.mark} at least a minimum level of **[real
constraints]{.mark}**. Among these are the \"social forces\" and
\"political, class forces\" that have been produced by the course of
history, which Lenin emphasizes. In addition, we stress here the equally
prominent role of \"productive forces\" as concrete sites of social
power, irreducible to their technical characteristics. In fact, we would
argue that the **failure of nearly every utopian vision** on offer today
manifests most strongly in their treatment of the question of
production, which is either ignored entirely]{.underline}, presumed to
be a purely technical-ecological matter best left to the experts, [or
viewed as so thoroughly subordinated to capitalist logics that
prevailing agricultural and industrial practices must be uniformly and
fundamentally replaced]{.underline}---with what, exactly, it is rarely
clear, though gestures are often made in the direction of local autarky.
Questions of locality and the precise process of production will
therefore serve as lenses bringing focus to our own anti-utopian utopia
or, more simply, our contribution to the science fiction of communism.
