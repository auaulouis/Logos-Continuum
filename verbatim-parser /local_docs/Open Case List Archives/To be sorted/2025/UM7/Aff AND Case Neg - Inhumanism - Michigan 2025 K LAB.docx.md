#### Geology is a racial-colonial science that ontologically divided the world---White Geology authored the Earth through extraction, dispossession, and the inhuman categorization of Black and Indigenous life. The Anthropocene is not a universal condition but the afterlife of colonial geotrauma, where race became the grammar of Earth's material value.

[[In the ledger of **geologic time** there are **missing
earths**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Earths [that appear only as negative
inscription, underground, beneath and **[behind]{.mark} the
[geographical]{.mark} imagination** of colonial earth and its
[discourses of]{.mark} **purposeful [extraction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Indigenous earths. Black earths. Brown earths. As planetary fractures
now appear daily in the shifting world of climate, [colonial earth
swings in an oscillating imagination of **[dystopic/utopic
salvation]{.mark}** in confrontation with the new geologic realisms of
the Anthropocene.]{.underline} Ends. Beginnings. [Narrativizing new
origin [stories for the planet]{.mark} and **continuing to [erase
older]{.mark}, missing, [broken earths]{.mark}** [that made the
present]{.mark} possible]{.underline}. As diasporic human and nonhuman
geographies transformed colonial spaces with labor, hoofs, creatures,
and crops they also erased geologies that belonged to other imaginations
of earth. These practices of "unhoming" through the epistemic dynamism
of the inhuman enacted environmental changes of state in
subjectification, climate, species, and elemental geophysical flows.
Alongside this geotrauma, all these dispersals carried illegitimate
geographies of passion for inhuman places and things. A patch of dirt in
the fat heat of summer.

As the geologies of colonial world-building led to the Anthropocene,
that building required first the earth-shattering of existing relations
and bonds of shared ecological and inhuman worlds. [[**Geology** and its
**epistemic practices**]{.mark} were a form of **earth
writing**]{.underline} that was [riven by systemic racism]{.underline}
in the building of colonial worlds [and the destruction of existing
earths.]{.underline} Geologic Life seeks to understand
[geology]{.underline} (in its broadest sense) [as a tool of raciality
that has historically [shaped]{.mark} the grounds of struggle [and
**continues to shape**]{.mark} material relations of **[racism]{.mark}
into the future**.]{.underline}

**[Colonial earth is the product of [white
geology]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a historical regime of material power
[that [used]{.mark} **geologic [minerals]{.mark}**[, metals, and fuels,
combined with]{.mark} the **epistemic violence** of [the category of the
**inhuman** to shape]{.mark} regimes of [**value** and]{.mark} forms of
**subjective [life]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As "end times" frame climate
change conversations, this book goes back to look at the beginnings of
the field of geology as a colonial practice that created normative
orders of materiality and destroyed worlds.1 I investigate how we might
understand [[geology]{.mark} as an **ideological and material
infrastructure** of matter and materialism]{.underline} that
[[shapes]{.mark} subjective and planetary states. And]{.underline} how
calculative regimes of geology [organized both the [**temporal and
political surfaces of power**,]{.mark} and its **racialized
undergrounds**.]{.underline}

I argue that [white geology mobilized **geopower** [to operationalize
the **conquest of space** across]{.mark} the globe [and **below the
surface**]{.mark}]{.underline}, furnishing its partitions and apartheids
as distinct spatial forms. Namely, [through Indigenous
**[genocide]{.mark}** and **[enslavement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, through
the shape of [colonial afterlives in **[convict
lease]{.mark}**]{.underline} and indenture[, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
through [[ongoing **environmental destitution**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Alongside the transformation of environments,
**[paleontology]{.underline}** (pale-ontology) [**[named]{.mark} and
[raced persons as]{.mark} geologic subjects** through the category of
the ["inhuman]{.mark}." [The **designation** ]{.mark}**as
[inhuman]{.mark}**[, used for]{.mark} both [raced subjects and
**subjectless matter**,]{.mark} diffused the violence of geology and
[maintained]{.mark} [the **colonial prerogative** of]{.mark}
value]{.underline} and its progressive [scripting]{.underline} of
**[[extraction]{.mark} as a genealogical achievement of
whiteness]{.underline}**. Antagonism to white geology is also an
attachment to other kinds of earths and inhuman intimacies not
continually wrecked by the accumulative geo-logics of those practices.
We can see resistant earth and ecological practices as a defining
continuum of struggle against colonial forces of transformation and
white geopower.

[[Propelled by]{.mark} a material **teleology of [extraction]{.mark}**
[and abandonment]{.mark}, white geology]{.underline} practiced a secular
geophysics of material determination that [was justified
through]{.underline} the [**[paleontological narratives of race and
time]{.mark}** that]{.underline} literally ["placed" peoples in
different strata]{.underline} (in a stratigraphic bill of rights).
[**Geologic time** became the **political time of race**, wherein
whiteness was **a tautology of material achievement in time**, and
race]{.underline} can be recognized as [a missing term in the
**stabilization** of material value]{.underline}. The concept of [race
[kept the **separability** of the human and]{.mark} the taxonomic
carcerality of the [inhuman intact]{.mark}]{.underline} (as bios and
geos) [through the division of matter, maintained through **subjugating
geographies** and the **spoils of extraction**.]{.underline} In this
current moment of the climate-induced crisis of materiality, in the
rapid transformations of worlds, the imperative to understand colonial
materialisms and their afterlives in planetary effects is crucial to
both materialist pedagogies of anticolonial praxis and the
epistemological shifts necessary for a different earth.

The elevated plateaus of privilege and subterranean rifts of [the
racialized poor in colonial earth are a product of historic materialisms
past and present]{.underline}, even as the structural and spatial
occupation of whiteness---as the product of white geology--- becomes a
multiethnic affair. [**[Geology]{.mark}** was the **predominant medium**
of the **instantiation** of]{.underline} this [earth and its continued
settler claims and **thirst for geopower** in the present. Geology
[explained]{.mark} the **geophysical processes** of [earth to make it
**epistemically available** for extraction and **ontologically located**
within]{.mark} the development of **[human]{.mark} and [planetary
time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To tell a story of the rocks is to see the
past surfacing in the present: a process of coming into view, of other
earths. In this political surfacing we find the ghosts of other
geologies sounding subterranean disquiets. Ghost geologies that testify
to a certain disorientation, a gathering of a series of ruptures. To
tell a story of rocks is to account for a eugenic materialism in which
white supremacy made surfaces built on racialized under grounds across
multiple--- political, geophysical, subjective--- states. Thus, the
history of colonial earth is also a map of the geophysics of race, of
subjugating rifts, colored earths, racialized gravities, and
Anthropocenic futures. The proclamation of universal fraternity and
common futures is broken again and again by the weight of racialized
gravities (that inflict the continued subject positioning of processing
violence and the inhumanity of being processed by geo-logics of
equivalence).

The origin story of geology and its materialization of a geophysics of
race is important for how we understand the divisions between privileged
forms of Life and its concomitant inhumane states of exposure and
dehumanization. Historically, this book charts the origin stories of
earth and scripts of race as natal twins, emergent in colonial and
settler colonial worldings through an array of geologic practices.
[**Racial and environmental determinants were coterminous in scripting
the earth** and its **geophilosophy** of human becoming in the
[**geo-logics** of colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, which intensified
during the eighteenth century. While those concepts of environmental
determinisms have been roundly critiqued, [racial determinants [continue
to **reside in** ]{.mark}**the [mantra of]{.mark}** ["**natural
resources**]{.mark}" (e.g., the **resource curse**, limits to growth,
questions of demography, the "**undevelope**d")
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} other more **[discrete [eugenic renderings of
what the earth is for]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I argue that [this
separation of earths is]{.underline} not [constituted]{.underline} by a
Life-nonlife (partial human- designated nonhuman) bifurcation but
[through a **Life-earth division (bios-geos)** that race mediates and
materializes.]{.underline} This means that the politics of
decolonization are not primarily organized in either metaphysics or
through its biopolitical critique but through the earth and its
categorization. The categorization of the inhuman as a subjective
register is not intended as a veiled form of environmental determinism
but draws attention to a contingent "state" of matter that is involved
in the subjective formation of geologic life. The imperative of a
lithic- eye- view takes biopolitical critique into a broader field of
reference that aligns the ground of thought with the ground of the
earth, thereby mobilizing a political geology that sees subjective and
earth states as concomitant states of being, collapsing the spatial
function of race in the production of value.

#### The resolution's call to explore and develop the Arctic enacts White Geology's imperial cartography---rendering Indigenous lands and peoples as inhuman resources to be surveyed, classified, and extracted. Arctic legibility is produced through geologic violence that collapses Inuit life into matter.

It is important to note that my study is sited in Nunavut, Canada, which
has a different history and was not a part of the Atlantic slave trade.
I will not be furthering Yusoff's arguments around anti-Black racism and
geology, rather I will be focusing on [[**racialization** and
**geology**]{.mark} within the settler colonial state]{.underline} of
Canada and how it [[relates to]{.mark} relations between **settlers**
and **Inuit**.]{.underline} This is not meant as an act of erasure, side
stepping the history of Blackness and geology that Yusoff has researched
so thoroughly. Her arguments make it clear that [both **[Black]{.mark}
people** [and **Indigenous people**]{.mark} have been "[caught]{.mark}
and defined [in the]{.mark} **[ontological wake of
geology]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (ibid: 14). While her theory is
predominantly supported by examples from the history of the Black
diaspora, she also includes histories of Indigenous peoples, mostly in
the Caribbean. [Indigenous peoples have been similarly
**[rendered]{.mark} as [inhuman matter]{.mark}** []{.mark}through the
**ontological flattening** of geology]{.underline} (ibid: 16),
[**categorizing** their **existence** as **equivalent to** the
**minerals** within the lands they occupy.]{.underline} In her work, she
chronicles the history of British geologic surveying and the
establishing settler colonialism (ibid: 29), which this analysis largely
builds off.

Kathryn Yusoff's theory of inhumanism is most closely aligned
theoretically to posthumanism, in her continued thinking through the
more-than-human world. In a recent article she posits that the
inhumanities are a way of "reckoning with the humanist liberal subject
that orders the humanities: an invisible and indivisible white subject
position that curates racialized geographies of environmental concern,
impact, and futurity" (Yusoff, 2021: 1). Yusoff's position on inhumanism
emerges from a similar place as posthumanism, extending debates within
philosophy, discourse studies, and other disciplines about the limits of
humanism for thinking through urgent concerns, including planetary
changes wrought by the Anthropocene but diverges in several important
ways. Thinking with the subterranean theorizing of the black radical
theory (e.g., C. L. R. James, Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Fred
Moten, Tina Campt, Tiffany Lethabo King) Yusoff's theory of inhumanities
fundamentally engages with the racist, anti-Black legacy of humanism.
She is thinking "with the inhuman as an analytic with which to
scrutinize the traffic between relations of race and material economy
and to think race as a material economy that itself emerges through the
libidinal economy of geology (as the desire for gold, mineralogy, and
metallurgy)" (18). Or, put another way, race is central to Yusoff's
critique of humanism and the humanities, which focuses on the material
classification of the inhuman made through colonial geologies and its
extractive grammars and their construction of race through material
extraction and slavery.

In this thinking with the inhuman, race and geology are inextricable
from the historically conceived liberal human subject and forces a
reckoning with the processes of power that have intertwined material and
racial histories throughout the colonial project. Whereas other branches
of posthumanism have taken interest in the subaltern people who have
been excluded from humanism, or the agentic qualities of inert
materials, Yusoff's work synthesizes the agentic relationships between
matter and non-matter, and the related, violent histories of racism,
that emerge when negotiating and creating race in relation to inhuman
matter. As such, inhumanism is a power tool for theorizing relations
within a settler-colonial context and does not fall into the same
patterns of ignoring or downplaying the violent legacy of humanism other
branches of critical posthumanism repeat, as discussed in the second
chapter. Inhumanism acknowledges and centers the history of colonialism
and the racial power dynamics while introducing the role of geology, a
historically understudied aspect of discourses of power.

Inhuman Archipelago

Analyzing Low's field report through [[**inhumanism** uncovers]{.mark}
the mechanics of **[racialized geopower]{.mark}** exerted [in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yusoff states that ["**geology** is a
mode of **accumulation**, on one hand, and of **dispossession**, on the
other, depending on which side of the **geologic color line** you end up
on"]{.underline} (ibid: 14). In Canada, [the **[racialized
geology]{.mark} of empire** deploys surveys to [aid]{.mark} industry in
[the]{.mark} [accumulation of mineral wealth while **dispossessing
Inuit**]{.mark} and other Indigenous [peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Yusoff argues that [through geology, racialized people, [land, and
ecologies]{.mark} "became **subject to encoding as inhuman property**,
as a tactic of empire and European world building"]{.underline} (ibid:
75). The Geological Survey of Canada and other [[colonial
institutions]{.mark} worked]{.underline} in concert [to **systematically
[transform]{.mark}** "those vast, virtually unknown regions known as
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} Canadian **[[Arctic]{.mark}
Archipelago]{.underline}**" (Weeks, 1927: 3c) [**[into
property]{.mark}** alongside the people who inhabited them to order
**[to extract minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline} to create wealth for the
rest of the nascent colonial nation of Canada. In this section I will
analyze three examples of how Low and his team related to Inuit, through
[representation, communication, and literal extraction of Inuit
bodies]{.underline}. The practices of the GSC team [served to align
Inuit with the inhuman through]{.underline} these inter-related but
separate modes of categorization, [[contributing to]{.mark} an
**[ongoing policy]{.mark} position**]{.underline} from the Canadian
government [[that]{.mark} literally [regard]{.mark}ed [Inuit as]{.mark}
part of the **[natural resources]{.mark} of the Arctic**]{.underline}
(Duffy, 1988: 11). As such, [Yusoff's theory of inhumanism offers unique
insight into **dispossession through geology**, and how **geopower** is
deployed as a **tool of empire building.**]{.underline}

Low's report goes into detail on the history of those considered fully
human within the western settler mindset. In Chapter IV, A Historical
Summary of the Discoveries and Explorations in Arctic America, Low
summarizes the Arctic expeditions of white men before him, beginning
with Frobisher in 1576. In his writing, [European scientists are named
individuals, and **Inuit are unnamed**, ascribed as property to
Europeans]{.underline}. This parallels the writing of Sir Charles Lyell,
president of [the Geological Survey]{.underline} of London, who
similarly [intertwines **[geological writing]{.mark}** with **racial
propositions**.]{.underline} Kathryn Yusoff notes Lyell's writing moves
between "'Geology and Cretaceous strata' and 'Montgomery. Curfew. Sunday
School for Negros' in one chapter ... and 'Distinct Table for Coloured
and White Passengers' and 'Fossil Shells' in another" (Yusoff, 2018:
81). While white European explorers are named individuals in Low's
account, the chapters on Inuit (called by the slur Eskimo in the report)
are structured similarly to chapters on geological inventories
themselves. These [**geologists** [draw no distinction "between **social
and geologic**]{.mark} **[strata]{.mark}** with regard to the **language
of property**"]{.underline} (ibid: 82) [when the **colour line**
established by the geologist's culture has been drawn.]{.underline}
Indeed, Low spends a nearly equivalent portion of his report detailing
Inuit lives (52 pages) as he does geological observations (65 pages),
cataloguing belief systems and measuring and photographing Inuit. In the
appendix of Low's account, he includes charts detailing the size of
Inuit bodies prepared by Dr. Borden, along with extensive photographs
documenting clothing, homes, and material culture. [The observation of
**[Inuit physiology]{.mark}** was [seen as **continuous** with]{.mark}
the study of [rocks, flora, and fauna]{.mark}:]{.underline}

> Geological examinations were made on these land journeys, as well as
> at every ship\'s halt, and large collections were made of rocks and
> fossils, northern birds, eggs and nests, skins and skeletons of
> animals, fishes and marine invertebrates, and plants and insects.
> Eskimos were studied, and a census was taken. Observations were
> recorded of the weather, ice conditions and movements, tides and
> currents, and the habitats and distribution of the whales, seals,
> walrus, caribou, and muskox of the region. (Zazlow, 1975: 173,
> emphasis added)

In this way, Inuit were aligned by the survey team with the landscape,
drawing an axis of inhumanism through their method of practicing
geology.

And much like the efforts of the survey team to exert sovereignty over
the territory through planting flags, the team set out to exert
sovereignty over Inuit. At the turn of the century, as Canada took an
interest in establishing their presence in the Arctic, the Neptune GSC
survey trip brought changes to Inuit and non-Inuit residents of the
Arctic Archipelago. Major Moodie, a member of the Northwest Mounted
Police (NWMP), traveled north with the scientists to establish a
permanent police presence. As an occupying police force in a sparsely
populated area, the NWMP were granted broad administrative powers -- and
while they were primarily interested in disrupting the activities of
foreign whalers, who were seen as a threat to sovereignty claims (Ross,
1976), Inuit lives came to be reshaped by the decisions of the NWMP
(Qikiqtani Inuit Association, 2013). While the Canadian government did
not seek a treaty with Inuit, and avoided considering Inuit as wards of
the state, policing Inuit came to be the pivotal action that led to
government recognition of the fact these people had been colonized when
Charles Stewart argued in Parliament in 1925 that the government
exercised Canadian law on Inuit through trials, imprisonment, and
execution (Duffy, 1988: 7). This policing was put in force when Major
Moody set up a meeting with Inuit and set out to describe the role he
saw himself playing. The officer arranged a ceremony for several Inuit
families, offering gifts along with an explanation of the structure of
the Dominion of Canada and the British Empire:

> The Major had about eight gallons of tea made and with five pounds of
> hard tack and other biscuits soon disappeared. A clay pipe and a bit
> of tobacco was given to each of the twenty-five natives present. Then
> through the interpreter the Major told the natives that there was a
> big chief over them all who had many tribes of different colours and
> how this big chief, who was King Edward VII, had the welfare of all
> his peoples at heart. King Edward wanted them all to do what was right
> and good, and had sent the Major as his personal representative or in
> other words the King could not come himself so \'I was to act for
> him\'! The Major wanted them to do what was right and good and to
> settle all quarrels but he would punish all offenders. (Borden
> 1903-04, p. 38)

Like the flag raising on the islands they encountered, the survey team
brought police to claim ownership of all Inuit through a brief display
-- a short spectacle preceding decades of imposition of colonial law,
continuing into the present. As such, the Canadian effort to claim [[the
**geologic resources of the Arctic** and the bodily resources of
**Inuit**]{.underline}]{.mark}, who were expected to hunt and guide
survey teams, and eventually work in mines and military outposts,
[**[share a natal moment]{.mark}**. **[Geological relations]{.mark}** in
Nunavut [are **obscured** by]{.mark} the maps put forward as **[neutral
artifacts of science]{.mark}**, "those lines on a map [and]{.mark} the
collections of **[mineral artifacts]{.mark}** they enable have
consequences; they **establish unfolding geo-logics**, for particular
bodies and subject positions, as **disposable** in the **shadow economy
of extraction**"]{.underline} (Yusoff, 2018: 66). [[Inuit]{.mark} were
[cast as]{.mark} another piece of the ceded territory]{.underline},
claimed by Frobisher more than 400 years previous, [**[fungible]{.mark}
within extractive capitalism.**]{.underline}

The last example I will analyze around [the conflation of Inuit with
**[inhuman matter]{.mark}**]{.underline} during the GSC survey [is
rather chilling. Dr. Borden, a medical doctor with the survey team,
details in]{.underline} his diary [his ongoing collection of Inuit
skeletons]{.underline}. His collection begins with "a very well
preserved skull -- no doubt, of a very ancient Eskimo" (Borden,
1903-1904: 102) and he laments that another team member found a skull
but did not bring it back to the boat (ibid: 103). While some skulls he
found did not end up in his collection as they were allegedly too fresh
(ibid: 117) Borden writes about taking the entire body of an Inuk woman,
saying "it was a pretty hard, nasty job but it will make a fine skeleton
& is now sunk in the sea to be cleaned" (ibid: 106). He went about this
removal clandestinely, and writes about the confinement of a dog
suspected of taking several of the skeletons he himself removed:

> The dog, which had been confined on the island, as the suspected
> robber of the grave which I had robbed for my skeletons, (noted
> earlier) was being fed by N.W.M.P. men. For, if he died, he was
> guilty, but if he survived, innocent. I therefore left word with the
> N.W.M.P. men to see that he had plenty of food. (Ibid: 131)

[While Dr. Borden clearly understood that **[stealing]{.mark} the
[bodies of deceased]{.mark} people** [represented]{.mark} a grave moral
transgression, he sees the extraction of these skeletons as [a
**legitimate scientific pursuit**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [**this practice isn't unique** to Borden -- "for
centuries **Western scientists** have disinterred **Aboriginal human
remains** and cultural items for collection and study"]{.underline}
(Blair, 2005). While I was surprised to find an admission of grave
robbing within a text accessed through the Archives of Canada, human
remains removed from Indigenous burial grounds have little protection
under Canadian law (ibid: 10). [[The **extraction of bodies** is an
extension of the **extraction of minerals**]{.mark} in a colonial
mindset that **racializes matter** and equates Indigenous life with the
inhuman]{.underline} (Yusoff, 2018: 89). Yusoff argues that ["the
**[classificatory]{.mark} [logics of geology]{.mark}** [have
implications for **ongoing colonialism**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (ibid:
89), [and]{.underline} Borden's [extraction of bodies for
classification]{.underline} in his lab upon return [is an example of how
**colonial science** served to establish racial categories]{.underline}
in Canada.

[These examples, from]{.underline} the **[[metaphorical
categorization]{.underline}]{.mark}** within Low's text, [to the
**symbolic move toward sovereignty**]{.underline} of Moody, [to the
literal actual extraction of Inuit bones]{.underline} by Dr. Borden,
[[aligned Inuit with the inhuman and]{.mark} served as justification for
ongoing and [expanded extraction]{.mark} by the **settler-colonial
state**.]{.underline} [While the stated purpose -- and the historical
legacy]{.underline} -- of the Neptune survey [was to inventory minerals
it functioned]{.underline} on multiple levels [as a tool of **colonial
dispossession**, [making the **Arctic legible as settler
space**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Grek-Martin, 2009) [and by using the
**organization and categorization of minerals** to enact
**racialization**]{.underline} (Yusoff, 2018) [on **Inuit
populations**.]{.underline} The geological relations first established
by Martin Frobisher, and reinforced by Low and the GSC, underpinned
eventual Inuit land claims negotiations, ensuring that territory and
mineral resources were the central negotiation pieces.

Conclusion

[The pursuit of **[map making and surveying]{.mark}**]{.underline} by
the Geological Survey of Canada team aboard the Neptune in 1903-1904
were not neutral scientific acts and filling in "the minor details" of
the map [was an act of **dispossession** and aligned Inuit with
**inhuman geological matter**]{.underline}. In their pursuit of serving
[the **[mining industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the GSC [[used
**geology**]{.mark} as a tool of empire [to create]{.mark} and uphold
**[racialized colonial relations of power]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Low's
team served to further the interests of an expansionist state apparatus,
through displays of sovereignty, [[transforming land into
territory]{.mark} ready [for extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
through studying Inuit and literally extracting their bodies from the
tundra. This chapter served to expand upon Kathryn [Yusoff's theory of
inhumanism]{.underline} and [extend the arguments she makes about
**geology and colonialism's** relationship to **anti-Black racism and
slavery** to Inuit colonization]{.underline} in Canada's arctic. She
argues that [[geology is foundational to]{.mark} the organization of
[**racializing logics** that create **extractable territories and
subjects**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Yusoff, 2018: 89). This case study has
sought to support that argument by providing evidence of the ways the
GSC sought to support extraction in the Arctic while subjugating Inuit
and aligning their lives with inhuman matter.

[[The **promise of mineral wealth** has driven]{.mark}
expansion]{.underline} within the settler-colonial state of Canada,
[creating [a **policy framework** that]{.mark} encourages and
**[incentivizes]{.mark}** the [mining]{.mark} industry, facilitated by
the GSC.]{.underline} Historian Morris Zaslow (1975) credits the survey
as a "significant force in the Canadian mining industry\'s rise to its
present prominence, and it has assisted the economic growth of the
nation in a major way," celebrating how [the survey's maps and reports
"have guided **generations of prospectors** to the districts where
particular kinds of **mineral bodies** are likeliest to occur, enabling
them to **concentrate** their efforts at the more promising areas and
**ignore** the much larger areas of barren rocks"]{.underline} (4).
However, [[the cost]{.mark} of bolstering this industry [has
been]{.mark} the **[colonial dispossession]{.mark}** enacted on
populations [of **Indigenous**]{.mark} **[people]{.mark}**]{.underline},
as demonstrated by A.P. Low's 1903-1904 survey [[of the
**Arctic**]{.mark} **Archipelago**.]{.underline}

In his recounting of the work of the GSC, Zazlow speaks of how
reconnaissance geologists extended "the blessings (or defects) of
western civilization" (ibid: 197) to the Indigenous people they
encountered, and this chapter has argued that the defects have been
overwhelming. [The **[intractable waste]{.mark} issues**]{.underline},
outlined in the previous chapters, [along with the **[socio-economic
challenges]{.mark}** and crushing poverty faced by Inuit communities
[are **rooted in**]{.mark} **the [extractive colonial
expansion]{.mark}** the GSC supported.]{.underline} Inuit were
classified and studied along with the land they have occupied for
millennia and looking to the rocks that were ostensibly the topic of
study reveals how [**[geology]{.mark}** was used to create a
[frame]{.mark} of **[subjugation and
dispossession]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Arctic development produces racialized sacrifice zones under the guise of climate mitigation---green extractivism deepens colonial domination by recoding necropolitical violence as environmental progress. "Sustainability" secures whiteness by turning Inuit and Indigenous life into disposable infrastructure.

The Arctic region is home to 4 million people, including over one
million members of more than forty Indigenous groups (The Arctic
Council, 2015). Half of the population are reindeer herders, who have
their own cultures, languages, and lifeways (Bladow, 2019; Kuokkanen,
2023). [The **[Arctic]{.mark}** contains large [territories]{.mark}
with]{.underline} past and present [unequal global relations that are
**colonial** in character]{.underline}. Several [Arctic regions
[have]{.mark} been [turned into]{.mark} key [**resource frontier sites**
for]{.mark} the **[extractive]{.mark} fossil fuel, metal mining, energy
and forestry [economies]{.mark}** supported by key **global North**
states]{.underline}, such as Norway, Sweden, the United States, Canada,
Finland, Denmark, and the Russian Federation (Bennett, 2016; Keil,
2014). These Arctic extractivist frontiers have been resisted by local
peoples, often Indigenous (Hanaček et al., 2022; Nygren et al., 2022).
Resistance arises against fossil fuels, but there are also movements
opposing green or low-carbon energy projects (Lassila, 2018; Össbo,
2023).

[The Arctic is especially affected by]{.underline} the cascading impacts
of the [climate catastrophe]{.underline}, with its climate [warming four
times faster in comparison to other regions]{.underline} (Herrmann,
2015; IPCC, 2019). [[The **climate crisis**]{.mark} and its **purported
solutions**]{.underline} currently [play an increasing role in shaping
Arctic life. Climate change [is creating a **discourse** ]{.mark}**and
actions** [leading to]{.mark} the expansion of [**green
extractivism**]{.mark} across the region.]{.underline} While risks are
increasing, [the Arctic is paradoxically perceived]{.underline} by many
domestic and transnational companies [as a central point
for]{.underline} so-called [new green energy solutions and mining of
transition minerals]{.underline} (Duxbury, 2021; Hanaček et al., 2022;
Len, 2021). For example, western Greenland, where coastal glaciers have
been melting, has been a target of new mining ventures seeking to offer
minerals for the electrification of energy (Gronholt-Pedersen, 2022).
[While the climate crisis has been caused]{.underline} mostly [by
colonial actions and extractivist frontier expansion]{.underline} by the
elites and corporations of the core areas of the capitalist
world-ecology (Moore, 2016), [[the **Arctic suffers**
]{.mark}**excessively**, and is]{.underline} furthermore [cast [as a
**\"sacrifice zone\"** for]{.mark} extracting minerals and energy for
supposed [climate]{.mark} change [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Össbo,
2023). [The crisis of the **capitalist world-ecology**, meaning a rush
to dwindling natural resources, is [**fueling a desire** to
expand]{.mark} **extractivist activities** in the Arctic, creating
a]{.underline} complex and [**perilous feedback loop**, as **[Arctic
extractivism]{.mark}**]{.underline} can directly [drive the breaching of
global climate tipping points]{.underline} (Kröger, 2023). For example,
flaring and increased atmospheric soot and dust from [mining cause
**quicker melting** [and]{.mark} make ice sheets **less
reflective**]{.underline}. An extractive push has increased in some
parts of the region alongside **[[worsening socio-climatic
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Kröger, 2016a, 2018).

[The Arctic remains a **prime target** for extractivism, notably for
obtaining the commodities to produce \"green\" or low-carbon
infrastructures instrumental in **climate change mitigation
policies**]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2023). Moreover, [the attack on
Ukraine by Russia]{.underline} in February 2022, [and the subsequent
rush for alternative energy and raw material sources]{.underline}
especially in the European Union, [has led to **major new expansion
pushes**]{.underline}, also [in the Arctic]{.underline} (Kopra & Wall,
2022). The sanctions against Russia, and the worsening
climatic-ecological conditions for extraction due to collapsing
permafrost for example, have brought difficulties for the sector in some
parts of Arctic Russia (Kröger, 2023). Visible resource conflicts and
resistance movements are thus just the tip of the iceberg when it comes
to local grievances due to environmental, cultural, and livelihood
losses experienced by many Arctic peoples (Heininen et al., 2022). This
is a topic that can be explored more deeply through the intertwined
concepts of extractivism and colonialism, which examine the structural,
historical level where extractivist hegemonies have been created for the
Arctic.

Extractivism describes those activities that violently remove or extract
large quantities of natural resources, causing major social and
ecological damage (Acosta, 2011). The type, character and degree of
extractivism vary depending on the sector, style of extraction, and
context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021), extractivisms -- in
the plural, as there are many forms, such as mining, fossil fuels,
commercial agriculture and forestry -- entail breaking down existing
local economies and their ecological relationships, with extracted
products profiting national or international business classes or
governments. [[Extractivisms,]{.underline}]{.mark} however, [are [not
limited to]{.mark} biophysical overexploitation and transformation of
[the environment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011; Kröger et al.,
2021; Svampa, 2019). [[They are based on **onto-epistemic violence**
against **Indigenous ways of relating** to]{.mark} the Mother
[Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} (de la Cadena & Blaser, 2018). [For
example]{.underline}, replacing the latter with [**modernist
assumptions** and ideas [where nature is]{.mark} seen as [**external**
and available]{.mark}, **\"free\" of people** or any constraints [to
**exploit**]{.mark} [and **appropriate**]{.mark} in whatever manner, as
fast [as wanted]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, [Durante]{.underline}
et al. (2021: 20) [refer to extractivisms as \"**a particular way of
thinking**]{.underline} and the properties and practices organized
towards the goal of maximizing benefit through extraction, [which brings
in its wake **violence and destruction**.\"]{.underline} Such forms of
colonialism and extractivism, when part of capitalism, do not only mean
imposing domination from foreign countries and corporations. Colonialism
can also be imposed and continuously sustained internally within a
nation state (Casanova, 1965; Churchill & LaDuke, 1992;
Maldonado-Torres, 2016). [Arctic extractivisms exist with several forms
of **colonial relations**]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022).

The concept of climate colonialism refers to how glaciers melting, sea
levels rising, and storms negatively affect those who have least
contributed to the climate crisis, such as Indigenous peoples, ethnic
minorities, and the impoverished (Landrum & Holland, 2020; Naykanchina,
2012). [Systems supporting colonialisms, such as **patriarchy, racism,
Eurocentrism, and extractivism** not only contribute to such conditions,
but also further impose their own climate change perspectives and
\"solutions\"]{.underline} (Sheller, 2023). [[Climate change
is]{.underline}]{.mark} in part [[a result of **colonial
extractivism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a greater discussion of this
connection in the literature has long been necessary (Bhambra & Newell,
2023; Moore, 2016). For instance, [projected green solutions and global
[climate interventions reproduce **extractive understandings
and**]{.mark} **dominant [discourses]{.mark}**, including viewing
climate as]{.underline} merely [a biophysical problem to be remedied
with technologies, finance, and better economic modelling]{.underline}
(DeBoom, 2022; Sultana, 2022). [**Apolitical approaches**,
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} little to [[no acknowledgment of **global
colonial histories**]{.underline}]{.mark}, also [include adaptation,
vulnerability, and mitigation strategies [that]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[continue to **[displace]{.mark} historically impoverished
[peoples]{.mark}** [from their land, **disrupt**]{.mark}**ing plural
[ways of life and knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012).
According to Gelderloos (2022) and Osborne & Carlson (2023), industrial
expansion and present forms of pollution are intrinsically linked to the
colonial state. The current climate crisis is the result of a
state-corporate nexus responsible for atmospheric change. However, [the
mainstream crisis solution]{.underline} to this nexus is based on a
carbon reduction 2030 goal, which [is inherently linked to existing
fossil fuel and green extractivist initiatives]{.underline} (ibid).

Put simply, both [green [extractivism]{.mark} and the climate crisis
[perpetuate]{.mark} logics of [colonialism and imperialism]{.mark}
through negative socio-environmental impacts, discursive (green)
ignorance, climate crisis denial, and attempts to create domination and
hegemony by extractivist forces -- all these actions [further driving
the climate catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap &
Riquito, 2023; Sultana, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). The term
\"necrocene,\" or the new era of death and extinction on Earth, refers
to such denial and silencing of historical and present struggles against
socio-ecological breakdown (Batalla, 2020; Clark, 2021; Mbembe, 2019).
Therefore, the poly-crisis including climatic breakdowns should be seen
primarily as a political state and a colonial condition (Sheller, 2023).
Combined, [green extractivism and climate crises form part of ongoing
colonialities.]{.underline}

There is however resistance to extractivisms, challenging their
long-lasting systemic and environmental oppression (Acosta, 2011;
Escobar, 2011; Kröger, 2020; Scheidel et al., 2020; Svampa, 2016;
Willow, 2016). Environmental conflicts exist around the appropriation of
nature through efforts to preserve and protect ways of relating to
nature (Jerez et al., 2021). Connecting climate change and green
extractivism with acts of colonialism allows us to see how such constant
invasion of territory, exploitation, and industrial infrastructure in
the name of saving the planet fit into the larger picture of oppression
(Bhambra & Newell, 2023).

The Arctic is a colonized territory. It has been historically subjected
to extractivism and additionally, it has been colonized by climate
change (Fjellheim, 2023; Kuokkanen, 2023; Össbo, 2023; Stuhl, 2016).
Most recently, \"green\" developments elicit additional opposition
(Bruna, 2022; Willow, 2016). Bladow (2019) shows that in Northern
Sweden, for example, with various kinds of protest going on including
artistic expression, activists create global networks and links in their
protests against extractivism, climate change, and other challenges to
Sámi self-determination. Our article shows how green extractivisms and
climate colonialisms are two sides of the same coin by analyzing sixteen
socio-environmental conflicts across the Arctic, identified in the
Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (ejatlas.org) (Hanaček et al.,
2022; Scheidel et al., 2020; Temper et al., 2015) and through a
literature review. The article contributes to the political ecology of
green transition by conceptualizing these processes as extractive, with
climate colonialisms continuously affecting the region and its people.

2\. Methods

The sixteen cases are assessed in terms of their particularities and
similarities. We look at the impacts of, and reactions to, green
extractivism and climate colonialism by different actors in the region.
In particular, we focus on the types of green extractivisms that do not
have a green outlook or color (e.g. avoiding trees and crops), mainly
wind energy, transition metal mining, hydropower, and LNG. They are
currently framed as \"green\" by their proponents, but they mostly
belong to the old \"brown economy\" (Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020; Wilson,
2013). They affect Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.

In our database are projects overlapping with the territories of
Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic, which include the Sámi in northern
Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Northwest Russia (the Kola peninsula), as
well as the Nenets further east on the Yamal Peninsula. Moreover,
Indigenous groups in the Russian Far East include the Chukchi (Chukchi
peninsula of the Arctic Ocean), the Khanty (North-West Siberian Plain),
as well as the Evenk and Dolgan on the Taymyr peninsula. The Indigenous
peoples of Alaska are the Aleut, Yupik, and Inuit (Iñupiat). Inuit
(Inuvialuit) and Kalaallit (Inuit) are Indigenous peoples of Greenland
and Canada\'s Arctic, respectively. Of course, Indigenous peoples are
heterogenous and their viewpoints on extractivist projects are diverse
and varied. However, opposition to environmental damage and climate
catastrophe has been central to Indigenous political discourses and
actions (Jarratt-Snider & Nielsen, 2020; Osborne & Carlson, 2023; Whyte,
2017).

We use cases from the Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJAtlas).
The EJAtlas is a widely used database for socio-environmental conflict
analyses (Scheidel et al., 2020, 2023; Temper et al., 2015). As of April
2024, about 4,000 cases have been reported in the database by
environmental activists and academics (Temper et al., 2018). The
database allows for examination of the commodities being extracted,
actions related to extractivism across different geographical regions or
even on global level, and social actor protests. Patterns and
determinants of repression of environmental land defenders (Le Billon &
Lujala, 2020), resistances against expansion of wind and solar
mega-projects in Mexico (Avila et al., 2022), or mapping the mining
impacts of the energy transition in the Americas (Walter et al., 2021)
are recent publications using the database.

The selection of EJAtlas cases for this article was based on three
criteria. The first was a location above the Arctic circle, 60º North.
The second was the presence of wind industrial complexes, mining of
\"new\" transition metals such as cobalt or rare earths, natural or
liquified gas (LNG) or nuclear power projects. In such cases,
governments, multinational corporations, and some scientists argue for
gas extraction or nuclear power as sustainable sources of energy
(Fedorova & Mitryaykina, 2021), but these claims are contested. The
third criterion was the conflictive nature of such projects, and this
may include street protests, media based activism, artistic expressions,
or even blockade actions (Scheidel et al., 2020). In addition, we
reviewed published literature on the 16 cases, finding 30 texts
interrelating axes of green extractivisms and climate colonialities
(Annex 1).

One part of the data analysis consists of descriptive statistics from
established categories in the EJAtlas and include commodities, affected
actors, and specific protest by Indigenous groups (Scheidel et al.,
2020). The second part of the analysis consists of qualitative
line-by-line coding methods which traced the interrelated axes of green
extractivism, climate colonialism, Indigenous and non-Indigenous
dimensions, as well as resistance to such interrelated processes. The
coding method assists in finding new unexplored interconnected processes
of social and environmental transformations. In this case, the
theoretical and analytical background presented in sections 3 and 4
served as a guideline in identifying such processes. The method is a
reliable approach to comparative studies that trace common patterns of
green extractivism, climate coloniality and resistance across different
cases at the regional scale.

To allow for a broad regional overview, our data has some limitations in
terms of ethnographic depth. The analysis is primarily based on
secondary material, including academic case studies, newspaper articles,
and reports. The sample is skewed towards the European and Russian part
of the Arctic, rather than Canada, Greenland, and the US. Two cases
under consideration were identified through a conversation with Sámi
reindeer herders in Norway by the first author in November 2021. Another
two cases were identified in collaboration with activists in Sweden and
Russia in 2021 and 2023. Only EJAtlas text descriptions were used for
those cases that could not be identified in the literature (n=3).

3\. Theory: (Green)extractivisms, climate colonialisms, and
environmental conflicts

Policymakers, mainly in the Global North, have been implementing new
green growth strategies or Green New Deals. The narrative of
sustainability and development behind these policies relies on
ecological modernization ideology, whose proponents do not question
growth (Wilson, 2013). According to them, these tactics promise more
sustainable industrialization and downscaling of critical emissions
(Chuffart et al., 2021; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023; Zografos, 2022; Zografos
& Robbins, 2020). Such strategies create opportunities for national and
transnational companies to develop so-called sustainable mining for
transition minerals, battery- grid-electrification complexes with major
low carbon infrastructural expansion, large scale hydroelectricity
projects, industrial wind power or large-scale solar power projects in
the global South and North (Avila, 2018; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022;
Zografos, 2022). However, these approaches focus on the addition of new
sources of energy and materials, rather than their full substitution.
Coal production continues to increase (Roy & Schaffartzik, 2021; York &
Bell, 2019), not least in the Arctic (Savin et al., 2021). Even nuclear
energy and natural gas are seen as two of the solutions to meet net zero
targets on the decarbonization journey (IEA, 2022; Kemfert et al., 2022;
Namaganda et al., 2023). Nonetheless, nuclear or natural gas-powered
projects also face opposition (Temper et al., 2020).

The term \"green extractivism\" is related conceptually not only to
studies (particularly after about 2015) that analyze conflicts around
so-called transition minerals for electrification (Dunlap, 2017), but
also to the critique of the so-called bioeconomy and conflicts and
policies to replace fossil fuels, dating back to the 2000s (Gudynas &
Acosta, 2011). Flex crops (such as sugar cane or palm oil) and \'flex
trees\' led to increased cultivation and extraction for agrofuels, feed,
and fiber, facilitated by land grabbing. These \"green\" plantation
expansions perpetuated social inequality and environmental destruction
(Borras et al., 2016; Dorn et al., 2022; Kröger, 2011, 2016b). We
consider green extractivism as a subset of extractivism, with those
activities under the green economy including more than the bioeconomy
(Levidow, 2014). Hence, green extractivism does not simply relate to
forests and agriculture. The current conversation about green
extractivism and the climate crisis focuses on windfarms, solar, battery
complexes, and mining the metals needed for all of these. Thus,
extractivism manifests itself in many forms and degrees, with diverse
effects and consequences (Kröger, 2022a: 47). **[[Green extractivism
fuels capitalist expansion]{.mark} through so-called sustainable
development policies]{.underline}**, with implications for international
and national legal and political frameworks. [These **policies**
jeopardize social, ecological, and political realities, and **[create
\"green sacrifice zones]{.mark}\" in which certain lives exposed to
contamination are regarded as having less value than
others**]{.underline} (Mejia-Muñoz & Babidge, 2023; Zografos, 2022).

Green extractivism arises in the name of climate change mitigation or
green economic \'\'development\'\' (Dunlap & Riquito, 2023). Green
extractivism is therefore a process, and in addition to flex crops, may
include bioplastics, carbon offsets (e.g. REDD+) (Kröger, 2016b),
transition mineral mining and related infrastructure and transportation
services (Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Bruna, 2022). The term \"green\" added
to extractivism has, however, typically little to do with sustainability
and solutions to the climate crisis (Zografos, 2022). [**Green
extractivism** often **[causes]{.mark}** interrelated
socio-environmental pressures through **[overexploitation]{.mark} of
socio-ecological territories**, including their culture, spirituality,
lifeways, food and customs, and social relations in general]{.underline}
(Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Jerez et al., 2021).
Thus, extractive \"green\" processes have typically neocolonialist
characteristics in the Global South (Acosta, 2011; Hughes et al., 2023;
Jerez et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They also appear within the immediate
semi-peripheries of the Global North, such as the Arctic (Hanaček et
al., 2022).

In biophysical terms, **[extractivist economies]{.underline}** depend on
the extraction of energy and materials, and **[[generate
waste]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Martinez-Alier,
2022). In social terms, control, access, and use of natural resources,
[disproportionate **[toxic pollution]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} climate
impacts are typically part of this process. There are also
[intersectional proc**esses of \"[Othering\", violence, and
death]{.mark}**]{.underline} brought about by the creation and abuse of
social divisions, [along the lines of gender, class, race, sexual
orientation, caste, and cultures]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos,
2022; Batalla, 2020; Pulido & De Lara, 2018; Tran & Hanaček, 2023). We
identify such processes in varieties of extractivism aiming to achieve a
carbon-free future, and to slow the climate emergency \"ticking clock\"
(Bruna, 2022; Clark, 2021).

Activists and academics have highlighted how [\"green\" opportunities
are not a solution to this crisis, but rather a continuation of
extractivism. **[Green extractivism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite its
name, still relies on intense material extraction (Andreucci & Zografos,
2022; Dunlap, 2018, 2021; Jerez et al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci,
2022). In theory it promotes sustainable development and prosperity for
all, but in practice [**[turns into]{.mark}** **[intolerable]{.mark}**
levels of [hardship **for Indigenous**]{.mark} **Peoples**, fisher, and
peasant [communities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Akbulut et al., 2019). In
what follows, we argue that **[the extension of green sacrifice
zones]{.underline}**, as well as the new consensus surrounding the
decarbonization path, **[can be seen as an expansion of commodity and
waste frontiers]{.underline}** (Martinez-Alier, 2023), [building on
historical patterns of colonialism and extractivism.]{.underline}

Del Bene and colleagues (2018) argued that [\"renewable\"
energy]{.underline} hydropower projects are associated with the
oppression of those who oppose them though protest, undermining diverse
epistemologies and world views. Meanwhile, industrial wind and solar
power [**development** projects shape uneven land conflicts]{.underline}
(Avila et al., 2022), occasionally [[**involving**
**occupation**]{.mark} **and [militarization]{.mark} of local
territories [and]{.mark} [displacement of populations]{.mark}**. In some
documented instances there have been **assassinations of
activists**]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2018; Dunlap & Fairhead, 2014; Fanari,
2021; Tran & Hanaček, 2023).

[The mining of green transition minerals have also brought
environmental, social, and economic harms]{.underline} (Jerez et al.,
2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). [Minerals and metals identified as
critical to]{.underline} the development of four key [green energy
technologies]{.underline}---solar, wind, electric vehicles and energy
storage---are listed by Church and Crawford (2020).2 They [include
aluminum, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, lithium,
manganese, molybdenum, nickel, rare earths, selenium, palladium,
silicon, silver, zinc, etc.]{.underline} Some are newer transition
metals (Dunlap & Laratte, 2022). [[The rush for rare
earths]{.underline}]{.mark} includes various attempts to extract the
minerals from the ocean floor or submarine hydrothermal deposits
(Glasby, 2002; Levin et al., 2020). Smelters and tailings [continue to
[expose]{.mark} local [communities to toxicity]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020). We find empirical evidence across Latin
America, South-East Asia, Eastern Europe, and the African continent
(Núñez et al., 2022; Siti et al., 2022; Sovacool et al., 2020; Zografos,
2022).

**[As the ice across the Arctic recedes, infrastructure-related projects
are on the rise]{.underline}** (Hildyard & Sol, 2017). [For example, the
Polar Silk Road,]{.underline} part of China\'s Belt and Road Initiative,
involves expanding local economic partnerships through [investments in
major infrastructure, nuclear powered icebreakers, and other extractive
projects along the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (Tillman et al.,
2018).3 The start of the war in Ukraine saw an increase in trade along
the route (Silk Road Briefing, 2023). [This Northeast Passage across
Russian Arctic waters]{.underline} is currently usable only for a few
months, and requires suitable vessels due to floating ice (Kröger,
2023). In the next decade however, even a \"low-carbon\" global climate
model predicts warming and melting of the ice (Kim et al., 2023). The
route [could reduce by 40% the distance between Northwest-European ports
and the Far East]{.underline}, compared to the Suez Canal route
(Kovalenko et al., 2018). [There is also a railroad in the planning
stage to link southern Finland to the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, passing
through reindeer herding territories (Junka-Aikio, 2023). [But what of
the [\'\'gradual elimination\'\' of local cultures and]{.mark}
livelihoods in these [necropolitical \'\'death-dealing]{.mark}
assemblages\'\']{.underline} (Truscello 2020: 6; Dunlap & Laratte,
2022)?

[**[Climate colonialism]{.mark} is** also **[based on]{.mark} this logic
of [necropolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Mahony &
Endfield, 2018; Sultana, 2022). Imperial and colonial processes shape
climate questions, and have been widely recognized in the literature
(Dunlap, 2020; Kallianos, Dunlap & Dalakoglou, 2022). Meanwhile,
[**[erasure]{.mark} of Indigenous knowledge, [imperial climate]{.mark}
infrastructure [visions, and extraction]{.mark}** are the most common
features shaping the socio-environmental and political characteristics
of a place]{.underline} (Locher & Fressoz, 2012; Mercer & Simpson,
2023). The current climate crisis highlights the importance of
understanding colonialism (coloniality) and reacting to the undesirable
situation that perpetuates it through [\"green\"
extractivism]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Dorn et al., 2022). A
recent publication by Vela Almeida et al. (2023) indicates that the
European Green New Deal not only provides opportunities for greater
profit, but also [buttresses the imperial power structure, leaving
little space for anti-colonial ecologies.]{.underline} Altogether,
ongoing developments in the Arctic region, such as gas, nuclear, wind,
hydropower and the new transition mineral rush in the wake of climate
change (Boersma & Losz, 2018; Össbo, 2023), as well as resistance to
such projects (Hanaček et al., 2022) illustrate climate colonialities
and \"green\" extractivisms, from old to new (Gritsenko, 2018; Sultana,
2022).

#### Environmental governance operates as white geopower---the state's management of climate and territory sustains racial hierarchies by securitizing the Earth through extraction. The mine and plantation rearranged geochemical life to produce whiteness as value and Blackness as energy.

The inhumanities forces a reckoning with the materialities of [the
[humanist liberal subject]{.mark}]{.underline} that orders the
humanities; an invisible and indivisible (white) liberal subject
position that [[curates **racialized geographies**]{.mark} **of
environmental concern**, practice, and futurity, from the material
conditions of science policy to]{.underline} metaphoric assertions of
environmental poetics. Although there has been attention to the
crossings between the nonhuman and race (see Jackson 2013; Luciano and
Chen 2015; Munoz \~ 2015) and the dehumanizing effects of racial
sciences, the relation between the inhuman and race--- the
inhumanities---is undertheorized.

The inhumanities refers to [the **[classificatory systems]{.mark}** and
natural philosophies [of thought that]{.mark}]{.underline} are
**[[desubjectify]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing (targeting [particular
[populations into]{.mark} things, [**property,** or]{.mark} properties
of **[energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}) and [structurally
[subjugating]{.mark}]{.underline} (to [**[black and brown life]{.mark}**
in the afterlives of **slavery and imperialism**]{.underline}). The dual
effect of this subjection is to underground agency, in a body of matter
rather than rights, [under slavery and settler colonialism]{.underline}.
[**[Blackness]{.mark}** was seen as a source of **energy** that [was
cultivated]{.mark}]{.underline} as a signifier and a carceral category
[to produce **value** [through]{.mark}
**[extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which race was implicit in the
material reproduction of whiteness and settler futurity. [At the heart
of]{.underline} that [**racial formation** was [the
**extractive**]{.mark} **[impulse]{.mark}**, which]{.underline} builds
capitalism into a globally functioning system that is world-altering.
Race [[was the]{.mark} codification of the [unequal racial distribution
of **geopowers**]{.mark}, its]{.underline} [accumulation
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[placement of]{.mark} certain [lives
in]{.mark} **material and psychic [proximity ]{.mark}**[to the
**inhuman**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and therefore less conspicuous in
the juridical and ethical recognition of a political subject.

As an analytic, the inhumanities puts the kinship between the extraction
of bodies and the extraction of earth at the core of its concerns about
the possibilities and potentialities of lives, conjoining genocide and
ecocide as tenants in the colonial project (and its kin, settler
colonialism and resource colonialism, or what Gomez-Barris \[2019\]
called the "colonial Anthropocene"). [[This]{.mark} move from a
**biocentric paradigm to a geocentric one**]{.underline} includes
rethinking how the social and political configurations of subjectivity
have been thought and experienced in relation to the earth. Extraction
[[drives]{.underline}]{.mark} a particular formation of [[what and who
gets constituted as a **natural resource** and where]{.mark} these
activities of [extraction take place]{.mark}]{.underline} in relation to
the accumulation of value. [Natural resources under **colonialism** and
its afterlives in **racial capitalism** equal [**extraction plus
capture**, result]{.mark}ing [in]{.mark} forms of **[epistemic and
material enclosure]{.mark}** for the production of value]{.underline}.
We can see a parallel framing of personhood under slavery, whereby
extraction (from Africa and precolonial relations) plus capture (through
the technology of race) results in forms of material (spatial extraction
and containment) and subjective (slave/native) enclosures. Developing a
broader understanding of colonialism in relation to the integration
between its knowledge and extraction networks, the emergence of
[**[geopower]{.mark}** can be seen as a political and **racial
technology of governance** of the present and as a set of forces that
[subtend the]{.mark} potentialities and **[exhaustion of
life]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The political importance of reconceptualizing the inhuman in its
material, epistemic, and conceptual forms is part of understanding the
material transformation of the planet (Clark 2010) and how [**[geologic
grammars]{.mark}** do geopolitical and geophysical work]{.underline}
(Yusoff 2018c). This is also to understand how [and]{.underline} where
matter relations [[organize]{.mark} and arrange]{.underline} particular
[**enduring forms of [oppression]{.mark}**, as extraction economies
traverse **subjective and material regimes** of value]{.underline}. As
McKittrick (2006) argued in Demonic Grounds, what would happen if we put
black geographies at the center of our analysis? What kind of geography
would that produce, and how would it shift the questions we ask? [The
[**mine** and]{.mark} the [**plantation** are]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[geosocial formations]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the New World; what
is important to notice is [that]{.underline} they [are both **social
institutions of extraction**]{.underline} (the mine and the factory)
[and **bio-geo engines** [that rearrange]{.mark} earth and
**[ecologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, because of their
repeatability across the Americas and empire, the material praxis of the
mine and plantation completely rearrange the geochemical flows of the
world, [setting into place changed **ecological [and social
relations]{.mark}** that are **racialized**. The **[geophysics]{.mark}**
of the mine and plantation [created the **metaphysic conditions**
of]{.mark} the burden of [being]{.mark} categorized as [black.]{.mark}
These **[geosocial arrangements]{.mark}** are a geophysics of
power]{.underline}

What are often considered as spatial divisions in the conceptualization
of political geography, and in particular the formation of planetary
politics or planetary scale, are actually a question of material
ontological division or "matter fix" [that **[designates]{.mark}** the
location of **agency** on the side of biocentric life]{.underline}
(which cleaves to a particular politics of life). It is [the spatial
arrangements of]{.underline} the divisions of [materiality]{.underline}
as agency ([as [**active subject** vs. **fungible
matter**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which material [enacts the
**master--slave relation**]{.underline}) [that organize]{.underline} an
understanding of [the **arrangement of power** as **race**]{.underline}
(see Yusoff 2018a). This partiality of a preferred form of life
characterizes, as Povinelli (2016) argued, the provinciality of
Foucault's project in its conceptualization of a Western European
genealogy. Sylvia Wynter, W.E.B. DuBois, and Achille Mbembe all showed
how that genealogy of man was underscored by the racial division of life
and nonlife. Although Arendt (1944) argued that race names the
connections between white settler states and European fascisms, she was
unable to see colonization as anything other than a mirror to European
thought and its practices in a "boomerang" 5 to European forms of
racialization (see Gines 2014; Owens 2017). In Western philosophy,
[[race names]{.underline}]{.mark} the point of quarterization between
[the [**inside** and **outside of (colonial) life**. This schism]{.mark}
between **inhuman matter** and subjects **[cleaves apart]{.mark}** the
biological and the geological using [the **signifying** practices of
**race**]{.mark} as a **discourse** located [within]{.mark} particular
bodies. This enables **[global geography]{.mark}** to be claimed [as
**universal**]{.mark} (the planet), an **[exclusive domain]{.mark}**
that does not have to admit those]{.underline} that are [not represented
by the preferred figure of biologism]{.underline} ([the humanistic
subject]{.underline}; Silva 2007). [**[Race]{.mark}** is [organized
around]{.mark} **biocentric codes**]{.underline}, [which
are]{.underline} in turn [underpinned by **[geologic grammars]{.mark}**
that **[stratify human origins]{.mark}** as they do the **origins of the
planet**, so there is no turning to the planet to do away with race, no
planetary commons that is not]{.underline} at the same time [in need of
decolonization]{.underline}. The imperative to introduce a concept of
geopolitics (see Mignolo 2011) that goes beyond a biologism divorced
from the earth and its interrelation to forms of life, therefore, must
be a compelling project for any antiracist practice.

#### Extraction depends on a racial metaphysics that divides life from nonlife---geological humanism constructs Black and Indigenous subjects as ontological ground for accumulation. The Anthropocene inherits this division, securing a world where only whiteness is recognized as life.

Although Agamben disagrees with a Foucauldian model in its succession
and relation (Agamben arguing that sovereign power originates with the
biopolitical body and that bare life constitutes political life), both
establish a dialectical relation between the human as properly
constituted as a political subject and its aberration. In its simplest
iteration, [there are **forms of life** on one side and **nonlife** on
the other; nonlife that is constituted through
**[death]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and more recently in Mbembe and
Povinelli's writing through forms of [[**social death**, **exhaustion**,
and **extinguishment**]{.mark}, wherein nonlife [emerges as a **zone of
governance**]{.mark}. The gravitational pull [that centers]{.mark} these
[divisions between life and nonlife]{.mark} is the human
subject]{.underline} as it is [conceived through a Western normative
frame]{.underline} (as Mbembe and Povinelli aptly demonstrated in
relation to black and indigenous life). This explains why Agamben's
"bare life" can only take place in the concentration camps rather than
on the plantation or in the hold of the slave ship: because the
aberration can only be visited on a human body that is already coded
human and whose recognition of such a status has slipped or is in
abeyance, wherein biopolitical regimes act as an injunction or
resolution of the potentiality of inclusion rather than its
impossibility.

As Wynter has deftly shown, [that [**human** was constituted through
**its geographical outsides** and **racialized**]{.mark}
**[others]{.mark}** from the onset, between]{.underline} what she called
**[Man 1]{.underline}** ([the **rationalized political subject** of the
state]{.underline}, who escapes its prior ordering between heaven and
earth in the chain of being to emerge as a political animal in the
context of the state) [and **Man 2**]{.underline} (the secular successor
to the political being, [a **biocentric being**]{.underline} who is
[brought into view through **evolutionary theory** and **eugenic codes**
of differentiation]{.underline}). Wynter argued that in the shift from
the feudal to the bourgeois there is the lack of a claim to a nobility
of blood, so the sociogenic mutation becomes a bioevolutionary claim
(after Darwin) to a select eugenic line of descent (through genealogical
account), what Wynter (2000) called the "governing sociogenetic
principle ... the master code of symbolic life and death ... that is
constitutive of the multiple and varying genres of the human in terms of
which we can experience ourselves as human" (182--83, italics in
original). Wynter's description of [the modalities of **"[scientific
humanism"]{.mark}** [outlines an **epistemology of dispossession and
conquest** through]{.mark} the **sciences** and [its **imposition of
monohumanism**]{.mark} that are nonetheless defined by a particular
version of]{.underline} **[overrepresented Western European
man]{.underline}**.

Wynter's critique assaults [[the **presumptive
"Referent-we"**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[necessitates]{.mark} the
formation of [**the other**]{.mark} who does not belong to that **master
class of species** [to organize]{.mark} the **logos of its
[belonging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As McKittrick commented, "Particular
(presently biocentric) macro-origin stories are overrepresented as the
singular narrative through which the stakes of human freedom are
articulated and marked. Our contemporary moment thus demands a
normalized origin narrative of
survival-through-ever-increasing-processes-ofconsumption-and-accummulation"
(Wynter and McKittrick 2015, 11). [[**The human** relies on a
**dialectic relation** to]{.mark} **[the inhuman]{.mark}**; that is,
**the racialized subject**]{.underline}. Another way to imagine this is
to historically situate the human in colonial geographies of extraction
that produced what Fanon (2008 \[1952\]) called [a **"zone of
nonbeing"**]{.underline} (2), [whereby the **violent positioning** of
certain lives in relation to the biocentric norm of the
human]{.underline} that frames the humanities [is **not a modifier** of
[the human]{.mark} but **the very action of its erasure**]{.underline}.
As McKittrick (2015) commented:

> [These governing codes [produced]{.mark}
> **racialized/nonEuropeans/nonwhite/New World/[Indigenous/African
> peoples]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}]{.underline} first, fallen untrue
> Christians (in the fifteenth and sixteenth century) and, later, as
> [[**biologically defective** and **damned**]{.underline}]{.mark} (in
> the nineteenth century). I want to highlight Wynter's assertion of the
> ways in which [our present conception of the human--- [and what it
> means to be human]{.mark}---delineates]{.underline} how [colonial
> encounters]{.underline}, and thus the emancipatory breaches and thus
> reinventions of humanness. This is to say that [at the nexus of
> theological punishment, colonial brutality, and imperial greed,
> [underpinning the]{.mark} new [sciences]{.mark} that
> recast]{.underline} how we perceive our physiology and our
> sociocultural systems---physics, astronomy, cartography, biology, and
> so forth---are the fallen and defective who put immense pressure on
> [[European ways of knowing the world]{.underline}]{.mark}. (143)

Alongside McKittrick's identification of the "emancipatory breaches" as
a spacing in the human, Fanon's conceptualization reminds us of the
spatial and subjective conflation of colonial understanding of vast
populations of people and areas of earth designated as matter awaiting
extraction. Yet, if the biopolitical frame is understood as always
already constituted through an inhuman ground (or racialized subjects),
even as it is prized apart by liberatory inventions that refute that
designation, [**[the inhuman]{.mark}** is what **[secures]{.mark} the
nonlife differentiation** to produce **[the human]{.mark}**]{.underline}
as such (Foucault 2009, 2010). **[[The inhuman]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, [[can **never**]{.mark} **ever [be incorporated]{.mark}** [into
**the political**]{.mark} [**subject** or being]{.mark}]{.underline} as
such [because of the material differentiation between figure (the
political subject of juridical rights) and **ground** (the matter of
resource to enable the becoming of the political subject,
philosophically and materially).]{.underline} Thus, the politics and
practices of making nonlife within a discourse of biopolitics, its sites
of concern in terms of bodies (the alienated human subject; the subject
without rights) and places (camps, zones of exception) remain exclusive
within the domain of [the human]{.underline} as it [is designated by its
partial humanism.]{.underline} According to Wynter (2000), this "partial
humanism" organizes "history for Man, therefore, narrated and
existentially lived as if it were the history for the human itself"
(198). [[Man]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[represents]{.mark} himself as
if he were **[the full scale]{.mark} and sense [of the human]{.mark}**
[and reproduces]{.mark} those [**epistemic modes of life** as life
(excluding]{.mark} the differential of [the inhuman]{.mark} on which
that life is built).]{.underline}

[Adjacent to this theorizing of]{.underline} a praxis of [the human
sits]{.underline} a set of experiences and discourses articulated by
[black theory (black feminisms and Afropessimisms) that name black
natality and its genealogical afterlives in the void rather
than]{.underline} in the caesura [between life and nonlife]{.underline}
(i.e., born into slavery as property rather than person; see Hartman
1997; Moten 2003; Spillers 2003; Wilderson 2003; Weheliye 2014; Warren
2018). Black radical thought has highlighted the difference between
populations targeted for erasure and those already erased; what Philip
(2017) refers to as Bla_k, as the blank-- black dynamic of erasure that
marks black life from Middle Passage geographies to the present space of
death-worlds characterized by carceral enclosures and terrorizing
architectures (Mbembe 2003; Wilderson 2003).

[**The antiblack ground** that secures the human]{.underline}'s
proposition [is **expropriating** through the material differentiation
of [the life--**nonlife boundary**]{.mark} that splits the agentic and
mute through a matter fix, which is]{.underline} also at the same time
designated as [a subjective boundary that [enables]{.mark}]{.underline}
further [**[material subjugation]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[This [**racialized grounding** presses]{.mark} the **[violence]{.mark}
of inhumane conditions** [into populations]{.mark} [designated
as]{.mark} **structurally [inhuman]{.mark}**]{.underline} (through the
exposure to the violence of environmental formations, wastes, and the
"quasi-events" of their inundation and epigenetic instantiation).
Another way to say this is that [the partial biopolitical
body]{.underline} also [presupposes **"white spatial
formations"**]{.underline} (Kwate and Threadcraft 2017, 535) [that
organize **black space** in a similar mode of **devaluation** and
**negative accumulation**]{.underline}. For example, Kwate and
Threadcraft (2017, 535) showed how [[the
**necropolitical**]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than biopolitical
[[**functioning** of black space]{.mark} conditions relations
to]{.underline} medical care in black space, pathogenic environments,
and [environments that [produce "**excess death**," **policing**, and
**the**]{.mark} **[expansionis]{.mark}t operations of the [carceral
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see also Wright 2011).

[The Anthropocene and its]{.underline} designation of an [operative
sphere of geopower signals the possibility of a potential breach in this
division between nonlife governed as nature]{.underline} ("natural
fruits" of slavery; the "natural" history of indigenous and "other"
peoples that we find in the colonial museum alongside flora and fauna)
[or life governed as social]{.underline} (through the sociogenetic
coding of overrepresented European man). To extend Wynter's formulation,
[**the Anthropocene** might see [the introduction of **Man 3**, a
**geologically informed subject**]{.mark}]{.underline} whose life forms
are coded through the inhuman, [whose constituting [powers are realized
through]{.mark} the **mobilization** and [**governance** of **geologic
materials**]{.mark}]{.underline} (minerals, geochemicals, water, air,
fossil fuels, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, etc.) [and the **accrual of
geopowers** as a form of securing **settler futurity**]{.underline}
(Trump's "freedom molecules").

The Double Life of the Inhuman

The inhumanities is a field in which the historic double life of [[**the
inhuman** as]{.mark} both [**matter** and]{.mark} as [a **racial
category** of liberal humanism are]{.mark} made visible as
[coconstituting]{.mark} discourses of modernity and the **[extractive
geosocial relations]{.mark}** that form the Anthropocene.]{.underline}
Inhumanity is a state or quality of being inhuman or inhumane, or an
inhuman or inhumane act. In short, [this is a savage form of
subjectivity that is organized as a category]{.underline} and thus
subjugation [for **phenotypically designated populations** through the
**operation of race**]{.underline}6 [within the historical geographies
of colonialism]{.underline}. As new forms of racialized beings were
articulated through sixteenth- through nineteenth-century paleontology
in the context of colonialism, geology was also articulating new origins
of the earth, as well as forming the material praxis of their
rearrangement (through mining, ecological rearrangements and
extractions, and forms of geologic displacements such as plantations,
dams, fertilizers, crops, and introduction of "alien" animals). In
Western philosophy, Adorno (1978 \[1951\], as discussed in the epigraph)
introduced the idea of the inhuman society in Minima Moralia:
Reflections from Damaged Life, citing that "life does not live" in the
society of industrial war, whereby intimate acts of life should be
thought of in relation to the catastrophes of the twentieth century.
Although Adorno, along with many contemporary critiques, saw the descent
into the inhumanity as located in his immediate historical context in
World War II, the fall already anticipates its redemption, "to project
negatively an image of utopia."

Whether catastrophe or utopia, [[the organization of]{.mark} **worldly
[ethics]{.mark}** around a **Eurocentric subject** continues to
**[erase]{.mark} any [responsibility]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the **[prior
catastrophes]{.mark}** that were [waged on behalf of]{.mark} and
materially constituted [the European ethical subject]{.mark} since 1492
[and continue in **ongoing**]{.mark} **settler colonialism** and
**[neoextraction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although catastrophe is located
in the realm of the imaginary in as much as the earth does not have
catastrophes, it just has changed conditions, catastrophic displacements
have nonetheless constituted the material and psychological lives of
colonial subjects and the subjected (which is not to say that within
those scenes of subjection, heroic endurances and poetics were not
imaginatively formed that materially and physically refuted and resisted
those colonial enclosures). Only by unsettling [the normative frames of
[the human]{.mark} as an [episteme of universality]{.mark}]{.underline}
(that thereby [[continues to claim an expansionist \[colonial\]
geography]{.mark} and refuses to acknowledge its history of inhumane
acts through which such a figure was constituted]{.underline}) can the
inhuman be encountered in the full sense of its existence, both as a
historical geography of subjugation and as earth.

[[The inhuman is]{.mark} not simply an alienated form of the
human]{.underline}, as it is most often encountered as a nonhuman
referent that stands in for the animal form as a reminder of the animal
root or pathologizing slur, but understood in its historic materially
and situated occurrence, [it is [a form of differentiation]{.mark} in
both matter and time, whereby the divisions and spacing of]{.underline}
the genomic or [organic principle of life are set in contrast to the
inorganic. New modes of biologism]{.underline} attempted to [declassify
man as an animal and reclassify him as a cultural-ethno being through
operative ontologies [that produced]{.mark} hierarchies and]{.underline}
ordering systems. [The denotation of [a **nature--culture
split**]{.mark}]{.underline} that is [[organized through the
**institutionalization of reason**]{.underline}]{.mark} (since Kant) was
[used to separate man from organic forms of life as both an overcoming
of internal passions that constituted human experience and of external
obstacles to an expansionist geography across territory and forms of
life]{.underline}. Historically, [this normative sphere of [humanism
was]{.mark} **racist** and **specifically [antiblack]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} without challenging that history, [it [remains
so, **every time the universal**]{.mark} **or [human is
invoked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of the greatest challenges, of
course, came from anticolonial thinkers struggling to make sense of
their painful histories in their fullest terms, such as Fanon (1959,
1961), Cesaire, Glissant, C. L. R. James and Wynter. As Wynter (2000)
commented, "The degradation of concrete humans, that was/is the price of
empire, of the kind of humanism that underlies it" (154).

After Wynter, we might ask: What is the context that produces this
geologic subject and brings it into being as a unified subject position?
What geography allows this conception and materially sustains it as a
geophysical state of stratified relations? This is another way of asking
after the ground, or, how the concept of the inhuman grounding is a
concrete material reality for black and brown subjects through the
epistemic praxis of geographic and geologic institutions. Rather than
taking white natural philosophers of reason as the site of the
transformation of the human, if we begin in the colonial slave mine and
plantation, the ground that sustains this production is the geologic of
the inhuman (as nature, matter, and race). [Without]{.underline} the
geologic of **[the inhuman]{.underline}** (as object and subject), the
entire mechanism that produced the relation between Europe and the New
World and [**the humanist subject** falls away]{.underline}. Thus,
[[**the inhuman**,]{.underline}]{.mark} as well [as a **source of
subjection**[, is]{.mark} also [a **site of possibility**]{.mark},
[because that **category**]{.mark} **of regression** [was **always being
transgressed**]{.mark}, and other relations were being instigated that
spoke to the **possibility of other relations to the
earth**]{.underline}. For example, Wynter (2000, 165) discussed how the
slave plot, where the enslaved grew food and cultivated other relations
of temporality and belonging, existed as a threat because it spoke to
other imaginations of geographies (see also McKittrick 2016).
[[Everywhere]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the inhumane is imposed, it
is]{.mark} **[resisted]{.mark} by a humanness** that highlights the
**dark contours of the humanist subject** in its
partiality]{.underline}. It is against this partiality that Cesaire
(2000 \[1972\]) imagined a fullness made to the "measure of the world"
(73). Thus, the anticolonial critique is not simply a critique of the
inadequacies of the human or a better humanism but a counterimaginary
that opens up a fullness in the register of the world (Wynter 1984).

#### Traditional Arctic Policy discussions are fantasies of liberal humanism that universalize whiteness through law and governance. The constitutionalizing project reformulates but never refuses the settler metaphysics that frame Earth as knowable and governable---affirmative engagement re-centers colonial futurity.

3 CONSTITUTIONALIZING IN THE ANTHROPOCENE

The project of constitutionalizing in general (captured well in the
introduction to this Special Issue) can be understood as encompassing
three forms of aphasia of central importance to clarifying the stakes of
the Black Anthropocene. First, [the **[constitutionalizing]{.mark}**
project **[maintains]{.mark} the assumption** that the [modern]{.mark}
[world]{.mark} should endure,]{.underline} merely reworking the
distinction between human as subject and the world as object. Thus,
alternative ways of governing are assumed to be available [[through
the]{.mark} **transformative [expansion of law]{.mark}**, by enlarging
legal subjects [to resolve the ecological problem]{.mark} that
'[humanity' is facing]{.mark}.]{.underline} Second,
[constitutionalization **fails to come to terms with** its own role in
the construction of the **human as individuated legal
subject**.]{.underline} Third, [the **law is not a neutral bystander**
to ecological catastrophe.]{.underline} Rather, the constitutionalizing
drive is a world-making (and world-destroying) practice.

3.1 Law beyond the human/nature divide

[The **constitutionalizing project** seeks to]{.underline} go beyond the
modernist view of the territorially-bound rights subject to [**enlarge**
the scope of the **legal community**]{.underline}. This expansion is
both temporal, [[by **including**]{.mark} future generations of both
human and [non-human beings, and]{.mark}]{.underline} spatial, by
encompassing [[eco-systems as]{.underline}]{.mark} 'terrae-dictions',
thereby including **[[new objects of care]{.mark} and
concern]{.underline}**.102 Thus, the removal or attenuation of the
human/nature divide is seen to enable the extension of law and [[to pose
questions of how]{.mark} 'the **Anthropocenic collective's new
subjects**, [nature]{.mark} and future generations, [can secure
representation in **governance institutions'** and 'how]{.mark} new
**[regulatory instruments]{.mark}** \[can\] distribute and
**[institutionalize legal]{.mark} and political
[authority']{.mark}**]{.underline}.103 [The constitutionalizing project
has not moved far]{.underline}, seemingly, [from the **projection**
of]{.underline} the Holocene where [the world as object]{.underline} is
[**infinitely available** and transformable]{.underline} through
hierarchical powers of division between entities, and the carving up of
land and territory through the mechanisms of law.104 [The **powers of
[binary categorization]{.mark} [remain]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
regardless of the imagined transformation of law away from its Holocene
framings and concerns. [The maintenance of [the **division**
between]{.mark} the **[law and its outside]{.mark}**]{.underline} still
[[depends upon]{.mark} the **hierarchical capacity** of [delivering
entities]{.mark} over [to law]{.mark} -- [and]{.mark} of **[rendering
them]{.mark} [transparent]{.mark}** through this process]{.underline}.
However, as Fred Moten argues,105 this power of legal interpellation
will necessarily fail to capture life, which will always be 'out from
the law's outside'.106

Thus, the first assumption of the constitutionalizing project is that
law can make its outside transparent through the inclusion of more human
and non-human subjects within its reach. [[The **supposed**]{.mark}
**plasticity** and [**manipulability** of law]{.mark} in its
construction]{.underline} of categories of temporal and spatial
division, [and]{.underline} the [redrawing of the
**boundaries**]{.underline} between entities considered to be [within
and outside the law]{.underline}, is something highlighted for example
by Sylvia Wynter. She writes on the **[[rework]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
of [understandings of **'[Man']{.mark}** [as a **malleable**]{.mark} and
changing **[legal subject]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while what is held
constant is the reproduction of the 'coloniality' of the hierarchical
construction of being.107 The history of law's redrawing of formal
boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, [**[without attempting]{.mark}
[to challenge]{.mark} the [underlying structures]{.mark}** that shape
these boundaries]{.underline}, means that any constitutionalizing
project may not achieve substantive change.108 [The desire
to]{.underline} draw upon other cosmological conceptions of subjects to
[rewrite [**legal categories** is not]{.mark} a **[recognition]{.mark}**
of non-Western or **non-Eurocentric** understandings, [but]{.mark} their
**[co-optation]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

As Saidiya Hartman notes, the ability to occupy other subject positions
may 'be considered transgressive or as a way of refashioning whiteness'
but, in reality, is 'just an extension of the master's prerogative';
[**[alternative]{.mark} conceptions** of the [subject]{.mark} are
**'utterly [displaced and effaced']{.mark}.**]{.underline}109 [This
displacement may involve **[sanitizing]{.mark}** and reusing
**[Indigenous]{.mark} understandings** [and **Black radical thought** in
an instrumental way]{.mark} that **contradicts** those very
understandings.]{.underline}110 Resistance against co-optation drives
the 'ethnographic refusal' of Audra Simpson, Eve Tuck and K Wayne
Yang,111 due to the exploitation of others' knowledge and the desire of
white settlers to (re)constitutionalize hierarchies. These limits to
external appropriation open up to question [the [ontological assumptions
of **transparency**]{.mark}**, equivalence [and universality]{.mark}**
at the heart of]{.underline} law.

In other words, [the constitutionalizing project [**reveals problems**
with the legal 'gaze']{.mark}]{.underline}.112 While non-Western
cultures and communities may consider decision-making without the
'distinctions that have ordered western human societies until now',113
the translation or appropriation of these approaches shifts the meaning
they possess. In attempting to not 'simply and uncritically "globalize"
\[Western\] current understandings of law and governance', the
constitutionalizing project imagines the possibility that law might
'transcend' the binary between human and nature through even greater
mastery of 'complex intersections between nature and culture'.114 The
binary divide that undergirds the legal imaginary is merely reworked,
reproducing subject/world relations.

3.2 Law as hierarchy

The second, related, assumption of the constitutionalizing project is
that law can overcome hierarchies through inclusion. Proponents of
constitutionalization stress the critical and substantive potential of
laws that can 'genuinely' address problems based in structures of power:

Our key hypothesis is that it is inadequate to simply and uncritically
'globalize' our current understandings of law and governance to face
this challenge, and that genuinely addressing catastrophic environmental
degradation requires passing from a law of the Holocene to a law of the
Anthropocene.115

The constitutionalizing project promises something other than a
reworking of institutions and mechanisms, namely a different type of
law. This is a law which does not assume the autonomy of the legal
subject. Rights thereby one-sidedly extend the reach of law without
extending accountability: 'In the Anthropocene, human dignity becomes a
dimension of the more general concept of vulnerability that forms the
normative core shared by human, animal, and non-animal rights, while
recognition and care become drivers of a responsive ethics that can
orientate decision-making'.116 According to the initial project
description, then, the Anthropocene 'poses profound constitutional and
structural questions about what the subjects and objects of governance
should be, how they should inter-relate, and how and from where they
will derive their legitimacy and accountability to the expanded
Anthropocenic collective'.117

The problem with this way of thinking, one regularly highlighted in work
in the fields of Indigenous Critique and Black Studies, is that [the
**[constitutionalizing]{.mark}** project not only [**reproduces** the
**rights-bearing human**]{.mark} that [it purports to overcome]{.mark}
but also]{.underline}, in the same move, [reproduces **hierarchies of
agency** and **accountability**.]{.underline} As Axelle Karera
powerfully notes: 'reconfigurations of subjectivity and its creative
invention of a "future people" [as [**solutions** to our ecological
demise, hinge on]{.mark} the **[forgetting]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
atrocious making of "another people" by [[**slavery** and]{.mark} the
responsibility such **[violent history]{.mark}** bestows on the Western
world']{.underline}.118 The conflation of the human with the non-human
extends law as a mechanism of hegemonic control. Saidiya Hartman's
Scenes of Subjection painstakingly demonstrates how the expansion of law
to newly constituted Black subjects in the post-emancipation period
reinforced hierarchy, through 'the continuities of slavery and freedom
as modes of domination, exploitation, and subjection', which
'reinscri\[be\] racial subjection'.119 As Yusoff expands upon this
insight in the discourse of the Black Anthropocene:

> [[The **colonial assumption** for]{.mark} the [responsibility]{.mark}
> for and of the world is articulated anew [as the **white man's
> burden**]{.mark} -- a **paternalism** that [is tied to a **redemptive
> narrative** of saving the world]{.mark} from harm on account of others
> [while]{.mark} **[maintaining]{.mark}** the protective thick skin of
> **[innocence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.120

The project of rights is marked with inequalities, exclusions and
oppression. Indigenous scholars such as Audra Simpson121 and Glen Sean
Coulthard122 refuse liberal constitutionalism that operates through
rights of representation or recognition. And Black Studies scholars
highlight the exclusionary grounds of legal being, which empties the
human of meaning in modernist conceptions.123 The constitutionalizing
project cannot address problems by granting rights when rights
discourses presuppose the subjection and dispossession of Black and
Indigenous peoples, drive the dynamics of racial capitalism and, in
turn, Anthropogenic climate change.124

3.3 Law as constitutive

The assumption is that law is epiphenomenal to the Anthropocene. [By
presenting **[law as epiphenomenal]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- as outside
a set of relations -- [the constitutionalizing project [**ignores** how
law constitutes]{.mark}]{.underline} these **[relations]{.underline}**.
It appears that law is responding to events entirely external to it:125

The Anthropocene's transcendence [of [**human/nature, public/private**,
and **global/local** distinctions]{.mark}]{.underline} foreshadows
worrisome consequences for our current Holocene-era institutions of law
and governance, which were conceived and structured around precisely
those dichotomies.126

[The c[onstitutionalizing]{.mark} project **[assumes]{.mark}** that
**[ecological catastrophe]{.mark}** is [**unconnected** to
law]{.mark}]{.underline}. Before the Anthropocene, it is said, we lived
in the happy times of the Holocene, 'where the world and its resources
awaited unlimited human exploitation' and where 'global
constitutionalism meant figuring out how to divide the spoils'.127 It is
only in retrospect that proponents of constitutionalization acknowledge
legal theory as inadvertently part of the problem. However, even now
[there is **no clear recognition** that [the assumption that the
**world** and its **resources** 'awaited]{.mark} unlimited **[human
exploitation']{.mark}** [was key to the]{.mark} **historical
[development]{.mark}** [of law]{.mark} and the constitutionalizing
project itself.]{.underline}

Only in this epoch of the Anthropocene has exploitation become a
concern: 'the scale of the changes posed by the Anthropocene are so
great that they are destabilizing how we distinguish nature from
culture, global from local, public from private, distinctions that have
ordered western human societies until now'.128 [The 'distinctions that
have **ordered** [western human societies]{.mark}]{.underline} until
now' thus [[**need to be rethought** on the basis of]{.mark} an
**[entanglement]{.mark}** between]{.underline} humans and nature
revealed by the Anthropocene. Or perhaps, as Latour would say,129 on the
basis that these 'distinctions' were never really real. [Humans and
nature, the global and local, the public and private]{.underline} are
entangled. However, proponents of constitutionalization implicitly argue
that their separation was not important before ecological
catastrophe.130

Yet the constitutionalising project redraws and remakes distinctions.
For the constitutionalizing project to hold, it is necessary to ignore
the fact that these distinctions themselves are the products of law --
that these distinctions are law. Thereby, processes of
constitutionalization face a problem, which is the erosion of the
categories, and the need to contain this problem through the creation of
new categories. There is positive work to be done in reconstructing
categories of 'humans' and 'nature' to make the world transparent,
'protected' and 'genuinely addressed'.

[[**Aspirations** to (**re)affirm** the **legitimacy**]{.mark} **and
authority** [of]{.mark} the [constitutionalizing]{.mark} project
necessarily [deny the **constitutive**]{.mark} **[role of
law]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In which case, the Anthropocene --
understood in terms of the policy crises induced by climate change --
can be presented as an opportunity for reworking the project of law, as
if the Anthropocene provides a blank slate for another world to come. In
fact, it would appear that the Anthropocene imposes a new burden on law,
according to geographer Nigel Clark, 'a white man's overburden'.131 As a
possible alternative, this short article, informed by the ethico-
political understanding of the Black Anthropocene, suggests that
'distinctions that have ordered western human society until now'132 have
not really ended. Until then, there can be no world for law.

4 CONCLUSION

From the perspective of the Black Anthropocene, [the **aspiration** of
constitutionalizing]{.underline} in the Anthropocene [**falls short** of
its promise to address climate change]{.underline}. More importantly,
[the project of **[law is problematic]{.mark}** in itself. The rule of
[law cannot be reconstitutionalized]{.mark} [without]{.mark} **a project
of [disavowal]{.mark}**:]{.underline} it is necessary first to disavow
law's (re)production of a world of subjects and of an outside amenable
to inclusion; second, to disavow law's definition of the human as legal
subject; and third, to disavow constitutionalism's instrumentalization
of 'the world' as a resource. [With the **Black Anthropoene**, the
Anthropocene is]{.underline} stood on its head, [no longer a **tabula
rasa** for law to reconstitute the world free of the past but a
**generative resource**, enabling a reading of history **'against the
grain'133** and making it imperative to **problematize
constitutionalization** and the project of law.]{.underline}

#### Thus \[[INSERT NAME]{.mark}\] and I affirm the Black Anthropocene as an onto-epistemic dissolution of the white geology's project to re-constitutionalize the 'human' within Arctic policy. 

#### The Black Anthropocene refuses to save the world authored through extraction and racial violence---it calls instead for reparation, refusal, and futurity as modes of rupture. Rather than reforming planetary governance, it exposes its anti-Black ground and insists on unmaking it.

**[The [Black Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline}** is a concept that
[both **affirms**]{.underline} the condition of [the Anthropocene and
[provides **new meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline} and an ethico-political
practice without re-centring the 'human' as understood in Western
thought. Rather, the Black Anthropocene asks those who find the
Anthropocene concept helpful [to attend to **historical processes of
racializing** and dispossessing **Black and Indigenous peoples**,
because these modes of **oppression** are **conditions [for
ecological]{.mark} [catastrophe]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} are **largely
ignored**]{.underline} by mainstream Anthropocene scholars. As Kathryn
Yusoff argues: 'An idea of the Black Anthropocene poses the question as
a redescription of the Anthropocene through the racializing assemblage
from which it emerged'.3

[**Ecological catastrophe** [is **inseparable** from]{.mark} an
**entangled history of [chattel slavery]{.mark}**[, **Indigenous
dispossession** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the ravages of
[**[racial]{.mark} [capitalism]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and this entanglement
is as much **material** as **ideational**]{.underline}. From the
perspective of the Black Anthropocene, the unfolding of economic and
social processes between the fifteenth and twenty-first centuries is
inseparable from ontological claims in philosophical, political, legal
and scientific discourses that simultaneously de-humanize Black and
Indigenous peoples and position nature as an 'object' that should be
exploited for a White world. Present-day structures and the ideational
claims legitimizing and reproducing them can be thereby understood in
terms of the 'global colour line'.4 Accordingly, [the **critique of
constitutionalization**]{.underline} posited here [is **not a simple
socio-economic or moral indictment of law** for enabling capitalism from
a Marxist perspective]{.underline}.5 [Rather, [at stake is
**re-narrativizing modernity**]{.mark} from its economic, political,
ecological and racial underside, [turning]{.mark} **ideological
self-understandings** within [a White world **inside
out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Paul Gilroy describes, [[constructing
modernity]{.mark} **'[from the slave's point of view']{.mark}** offers a
**rich 'unique perspective** on many of **the key intellectual and
political issues'** in modernity]{.underline}.6

In the treatment here, [the 'slave's point of view' is [a
positionality]{.mark} that is **liminal** to but [**constitutive** of
a]{.mark} modernist ontology of **[binary]{.mark} division** [between
**human** and **world**]{.mark}, a positionality both **included** and
**excluded** -- **neither fully human nor fully
non-human**]{.underline}: a positionality from which an ontology of
fixed essences and binary cuts can exist only through catastrophic
violence. It is important to note here that forms of division and the
constitution of different 'genres' of the human have been historically
variable.7 Nevertheless, the necessity of [[this cut between]{.mark}
**the [human]{.mark}** and **the [non-human]{.mark}** and **the
catastrophic violence** implied and **required** by it, [grounds]{.mark}
the conception of **([anti-)Blackness]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Anti-Blackness is therefore not uniquely dependent upon racial
signifiers of morphology, even as ideologies and practices of
anti-Blackness mark the bodies of Black people at structural,
institutional and individual levels. Rather, like Anthropocene,
'Blackness' is a concept which in this case denotes for Yusoff, 'a name
for nonnormative subjectivity'.8

Blackness, from this standpoint, is a kind of relational
differentiation, inscribed in the process of distinguishing an
'unmarked' (i.e. White) referent as the norm -- the 'fully human'
subject.9 [**Blackness** is 'produced' as the **antithesis of the modern
autonomous rational subject** and becomes **part of the
'world'**]{.underline} (an instrumentalizable object). [[Thus,]{.mark}
[what is proposed]{.mark} here [is]{.mark} **not an alternative
'-cene'** to the Anthropocene but [a **shift** ]{.mark}**in
understanding** [that places **anti-Blackness** and]{.mark} the **modern
ontology of [the individuated subject]{.mark}** and the world [at the
**heart of ecological catastrophe**]{.mark}. The ethico-political
response to **this conceptual shift**]{.underline}, for Yusoff,
**[cannot be]{.underline}** one of **['individuated liberal modes of
subjectivity]{.underline}** and subjection' [that bring in **the
previously excluded**. Rather, [**the 'world must end** for
**another**]{.mark} **relation to the [earth]{.mark}** [to
**begin'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}10

This present article relies on Yusoff's concept of the Black
Anthropocene, while supplementing her work with Black Studies
scholarship that does not directly affirm the Anthropocene concept,
although it may indirectly challenge and enrich that concept. It is
crucial to emphasize that for the Black Anthropocene, understood thus,
the problem is the racializing construction of the human as well as
ontological assumptions about the world -- including the treatment of
Black peoples within it -- as object, denoted by the concept of
'anti-Blackness'.11 In the dominant modernist Anthropocene imaginary of
moving 'beyond the human', meaning beyond the human/nature divide, it is
assumed that the human can be reformed while the world remains the
same.1

In this case, reconstructive work is possible. World-making can
continue, informed by new sensitivities nurtured through theoretical
approaches, critical or Indigenous cosmologies and ontologies and other
radical, emancipatory understandings.13 In other words, mainstream
critical theorists are happy to engage with disruptive understandings of
complexity, care and entanglement but the human is still the central,
world-saving subject.

Bruno Latour's solution to ecological crisis exemplifies this approach,
notably his call for Europe to take the lead in 'reinventing' or
'recalling' its construction of modernity, moving beyond state-based and
global conceptions of planetary problems.14 At stake in his call for
domestic and international reform, Latour explains, is the meaning of
the human, at stake in struggles of 'Terrestrials' or the 'Earthbound'
against the 'Moderns'.15 For Latour's project of salvage, rationalist,
universalist, scientific and linear understandings of the world can be
replaced by relational, more-than-human, poetic and nonlinear
approaches; thus, even if not everything of the modern world can be
saved, it is at least possible to 'wake up' to a new reality and repair
and rework disciplinary understandings.16

From the perspective of the Black Anthropocene, however, the critical
work of saving the world through more-than-human relations and
knowledges is problematic, because it lacks an appreciation of the
violence implicit in the separation of the human from the world.17 In
drawing attention to this violence, critics such as Heather Davis and
Zoe Todd write that 'The notion of the Anthropocene-as-disaster in
dominant scientific and social science discourses must also tend to the
ongoing disaster of the Middle Passage \... \[W\]e must expand and
pluralize collective understandings of the disasters of the
Anthropocene, and we must certainly expand our temporality'.18 Like
these authors, Deborah Danowski and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro argue
that for Indigenous peoples, the 'end of the world' can be dated from
Columbus' arrival in the Americas.19 In a similar register, Black
Studies scholars draw attention to how discourses of moving 'beyond' the
human reproduce existing hierarchies of being.20

This focus on the inseparability of the 'Anthropocene-as-disaster' from
the making of the modern world, both materially and ideationally,
distinguishes the Black Anthropocene from radical Marxist and Third
World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL) scholarship, which have
tended to seek the reconstruction of international law by dismantling
racial capitalism.21 **[The Black Anthropocene]{.underline}** is similar
to critical environmental law22 and literature on posthuman
legalities,23 in that it [questions **ontological and epistemological
assumptions** informing **the human/nature divide**]{.underline}.
However, [the [Black Anthropocene seeks]{.mark} not only [to **redraw
the boundary between human and non-human**]{.mark}]{.underline} and to
indicate the need for new epistemological approaches to agency, [[but
also]{.mark} to **[work outside these categories]{.mark}**, including
the **possibility of their (re-)construction**. [The end of the
human/nature divide is]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby **[[not a policy
option]{.underline}]{.mark}** or a choice, [enabling a **second chance
for modernity**. There can be **no 'wiping the slate clean'** and
**starting anew**]{.underline}.

This interdiction emphasizes ontological constraints, and the priority
of ontology brings attention to the human/nature divide as resulting
from historical processes of colonial and capitalist 'development' --
that is, in the construction of the anti-Black 'world' that is now under
threat from climate change. As Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues, [[there can
be **no**]{.mark} **discussion of [addressing the]{.mark} human/nature
[divide]{.mark}** [without]{.mark} addressing **the question of
(anti-)Blackness**: [moving beyond]{.mark} **the modernist ontology of
[the human]{.mark}** 'is **simultaneously the movement [toward
blackness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether blackness is embraced or not,
[as blackness constitutes the very matter at hand']{.underline}.24
[**The human/nature divide** is]{.underline} understood to be [at the
core of]{.underline} the [**modernist episteme** and a **historical
product** of]{.underline} the process of [**European colonial
expansion** and]{.underline} the [**appropriation** of territories,
**Black bodies** and goods]{.underline} that underpinned capitalist
growth and (settler) colonial rule [through the process of
**transatlantic slavery**]{.underline}. Racial capitalism,25 defined by
Cedric Robinson, inaugurated a bifurcated world policed domestically and
internationally through what W.E.B. Du Bois famously called the 'colour
line'.26 From a Black Anthropocene perspective, it is problematic to
claim that the human/nature divide is only recent or 'revealed' by
contemporary environmental catastrophe.27

Although ontology is a central concern of **[the [Black
Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline}**, this analytic [[is **anti-or
non-ontological** in that it]{.mark} **does not** seek to posit
**another 'truth' of the world**]{.underline}. Elizabeth Povinelli's
recent work captures this well, in the claim that 'the first condition
is a racial and colonial condition, not an ontological one'.28 Rather
than starting with abstract, timeless or metaphysical assumptions of
entanglement or relation, the violence of tangible world-making is
placed centre-stage.29 In the face of this ongoing violence, the Black
Anthropocene is an articulation of a new set of ethico-political
practices and understandings that hold open the possibilities of
disrupting and refusing this condition, rather than ameliorating it.
[**The Black Anthropocene** questions the world]{.underline}, not only
as a modernist conceit or as too human-centred, but also [as
**inextricable** from **anti-Blackness**]{.underline}. As Fred Moten
writes, '\[B\]lackness is the anoriginal displacement of ontology \...
ontology's anti- and antefoundation, ontology's underground, the
irreparable disturbance of ontology's time and space'.30

[The Black Anthropocene [seeks to **deconstruct**]{.mark}, to
**desediment**, to **disrupt [ontological assumptions]{.mark}**,
emphasizing the **non-/post-/para-/quasi-ontological violence** [that
**fixes entities** as **separate** and
**distinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}.31 [**The modern world**
is]{.underline} therefore [an **ongoing product of racializing
violence**]{.underline}, not only in structural terms (of coloniality,
dispossession, slavery and genocide) but also ontologically (sedimenting
cuts and divisions), [[enabling **some** ]{.mark}**entities**
[to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} recognized as **[legal subjects]{.mark}** with
**rights** and **responsibilities**]{.underline} -- by those with power
[-- [and **others** to be **'**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**thing-ified'**,
**denied agency** and [**subjected** to]{.mark} **instrumentalization**
and **[gratuitous violence]{.mark}**. The Black
Anthropocene]{.underline} thus **[resists demands to save]{.underline}**
the existing order of [**the (anti-Black) world** through **new forms of
governmentality**]{.underline}.32 In short, the Black Anthropocene
assumes that **[[saving the world]{.mark} as such [is
problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In the dominant Anthropocene framing, it is the changing world that
poses a problem for modernist understandings and assumptions. For the
Black Anthropocene, it is instead modernist understandings and
assumptions that produce changing environmental conditions through the
ravages of racial capitalism and colonialism, which pose a problem. The
changing environment is not simply the outcome of, nor more important
than, these prior oppressive structures. Thus, Claire Colebrook explains
that [**instead** of focusing on how **this (anti-Black) world can be
saved**, one might 'recognize that **"the world"** has **already
demanded the end** of **so many modes of existence**]{.underline} to the
point where [[the **end of the world** might]{.mark} [be an **opening
to**]{.mark} **something other than constant annihilation** \... a mode
of **[existence without world']{.mark}**]{.underline}.33

The Black Anthropocene thus rejects dominant approaches to the
Anthropocene. It can be read in a range of theoretical perspectives
oriented to what could be called 'ontology-critique' in Black Studies,
which focuses on how the (re)production of the human and the broader
context of modernity produce racial violence and exclusion.34 [There are
**distinctive ethico-political demands** of **the [Black
Anthropocene]{.mark}**]{.underline} that arise from this alternative
ontology-critique, three of which I will highlight.

[The first ethico-political demand]{.underline} of the Black
Anthropocene [is **reparation**. Reparative work [seeks **neither to
'make good'**, **nor**]{.mark} **to [restore]{.mark}**, what has been
lost from the modernist world. [Instead]{.mark}, the Black Anthropocene
seeks **transformation**]{.underline},35 [through an [account]{.mark}ing
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} that which has been disavowed by modernity. As
Tiffany Lethabo King explains, the point is not to reject the
subjecthood of the human per se but to recognize [[the
**violence**]{.mark} **against certain peoples** and ways of life
[that]{.mark} was the **[precondition]{.mark} of [the
human]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as defined for the modern world.36
Reparative work refuses modernist cuts and binaries, bringing in the
violence and genocide of Black and Indigenous peoples necessary to
modern 'development' and 'progress'.37 [[**Reparation** is]{.mark} the
**call for [the end of the world]{.mark} of modernist ontology**, rather
than **its reform**]{.underline}.38 King makes the point powerfully:
'Black and Native/Indigenous absorption into the category of the human
would disfigure the category of the human beyond recognition'.39 As
Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues, [putting **anti-Blackness at the
centre**]{.underline} of our conceptual framing [enables the generation
of **'new possibilities for [rethinking ontology']{.mark}** and
**'[alters the meaning]{.mark} and significance [of being
(human]{.mark})'**]{.underline}.40 [[**Reparative claims**]{.mark} of
the Black Anthropocene are **not [about 'equality' or 'rights]{.mark} of
inclusion'** or representation, because **these frames of recognition
[perpetuate]{.mark} the [status quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}.41 [Instead,
reparation requires 'a **different ethics**]{.underline}, one not
grounded in the subject/object distinction', [whereby **freedom** is
understood as an **open-ended non-ontological**]{.underline},
non-grounded [project of **more-than-individual
becoming**]{.underline}.42

[The **second ethico-political demand** of the [Black Anthropocene is
**critique**]{.mark}. Critical work consists of [**refusal** and
**resistance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is highlighted by movements
[[to]{.mark} **abolish** and **decolonize** [institutions that
**reproduce modernist hegemony**]{.mark}, such as the police and the
university]{.underline}.43 [Critique might [also]{.mark} be understood
as **[flight from the world]{.mark} of modernity** and]{.underline},
instead, as [holding the world **open beyond absolute divides** among
entities]{.underline}, which are otherwise in relation. '[Flight' does
not mean fleeing 'from' institutions 'to' some time or place,
but]{.underline} a practice of being in relation.44 It is important to
bear in mind the distinction between such critique, and modernist claims
to rights or identities.45 Critique here means [the **[refusal]{.mark}
of rights-based claims** that have been **historically denied** to Black
people]{.underline}.46 [Critical work could be framed [as
**'ante-political'**]{.mark} **politics**, [rather than
**anti-political**]{.mark}]{.underline}:47 [**a politics of
[hold]{.mark}ing [the world open]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} impositions
of [**ontological fixity** and **conceptual
closure**]{.mark}]{.underline}.48 [The space created is not formal but
rather a practice, a mode of being together,]{.underline} articulated in
a variety of ways (and with respective nuances): by Laura Harris as an
'aesthetic sociality of blackness';49 by J Kameron Carter as
'malpractice';50 by Harney and Moten as the 'undercommons';51 and by
Ronald A Judy in terms of 'para-semiotic' becoming.52

[The **[third]{.mark} ethico-political [demand]{.mark}** of the Black
Anthropocene [is **futurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The critical
ontological focus of the Black Anthropocene refers to [futurity [as **a
process**, rather than]{.mark} a [temporal]{.mark} sense of
['after']{.mark}]{.underline} the modern world. [The
[precondition]{.mark} for this [is]{.mark} a [**radical openness**
to]{.mark} the outside and to [alterity]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
rather than a relation of the subject to the world as an object, which
then requires an ethic of care.53 Here, as Kara Keeling indicates, the
work of Édouard Glissant is key to thinking of futurity as a process of
openness rather than temporal closure.54 Glissant opens his book,
Poetics of Relation, with the Middle Passage: the experience of
catastrophic violence and dispossession -- of the abyss -- understood as
transformative, as dissolving the subject into a 'nonworld'.55 A new
subject is thereby given violent birth. A subject not from the
perspective of a modernist ontology as lacking in being, but rather from
that of [[the **enslaved**]{.mark} **person**, a subject [who is
**becoming**, **unconstrained by**]{.mark} **an ontology of
[identity]{.mark}**, without essence, without [origin]{.mark}, **without
[telos]{.mark}**]{.underline}.56 This 'abyssal subject' thereby
[[embodies **futurity**]{.mark} **[without possessing a
'world']{.mark}**]{.underline}.57 [The radical dispossession of
sovereign subjectivity enables **'unthinking mastery'**]{.underline},58
[becoming as a process of **continual unmaking of the
self**]{.underline}.59 [By removing assumptions of essence or fixity,
[futural work is]{.mark} **not** [about]{.mark}]{.underline} the modern
subject [making the future]{.underline} differently, [but rather,
**[unmaking]{.mark}** the [**ontological constraints** of]{.mark} [the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 Key to understanding the distinction
between an ontology of distinctions, entities, essences and causal
determination and the Black Anthropocene's futurity of openness is
Glissant's concept of opacity61 -- that we are always already within a
totality of Relation where ontological distinctions make no sense as
entities are in 'relations that are not relationships' between groups
and cultural forms: relations such as 'correlation' and 'summation'.62
Entities are irreducible, always in excess of any representation by any
other entity, even as 'new and unexpected cultural forms' are produced
through creolization.63 Thus, there is no shared world beyond the
'nonworld' of opacity, which is thereby 'also the force' bringing
communities together and into contact with one another in processes of
becoming.64

#### A Poetics of Relation unworks the ontological cuts of humanism---dissolving the foundations of law, geology, and extractive order. The Black Anthropocene holds open the nonworld of fugitivity and opacity, where liberation exceeds governance and refuses to be rendered transparent.

Glissant advocates an alternative approach to being in the world
relationally. What he offers is [[a **Poetics of
Relation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.77 This poetics [[challenges
**universal**]{.mark}**, generalizing or transcendent
[totalities]{.mark}** [by focusing on]{.mark}
**[specificity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. His approach is a practical one
in which the subject does not produce itself and the world; the 'world'
has already been catastrophically imposed, [the task is to]{.underline}
survive within it, [[to **carve out alternative ways of being**]{.mark}
by **holding open the cuts**, the inability to decide, to judge or to
place]{.underline}. As Glissant states, [the notion of
**'[opacity]{.mark}'** describes **'an irreducible
singularity'**]{.underline}.78 He further explains that '[**The opaque**
is **not the obscure**]{.underline}, though it is possible for it to be
so and be accepted as such. [It is **that which cannot be
reduced**]{.underline}, which is the most perennial guarantee of
participation and confluence'.79 As Tiffany Lethabo King notes, in her
reading of Glissant, [this framing [establishes]{.mark} a **'[poetic
politics']{.mark}**, which]{.underline} can 'conceptualize a kind of
"uncharted" surroundings that are continually made, remade, or
unmade'.80 The key point about Glissant's conception of 'opacity' is
that this [slows [and disrupts]{.mark} **assumptions of [regularity and
linearity]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark} are the [condition]{.mark} of
possibility for [the **constitutionalizing impulse**]{.mark}. Opacity
**'enables other modes of thinking'**, and thus **'opens up other kinds
of potentialities, materialities and forms'**]{.underline}.81

It is important to emphasize again that **[the [Black
Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline}**, described here, is concerned with a
different relation to 'otherness', one that is not instrumentalizing,
whereby one community projects its needs and desires onto another.82
While Glissant [[claims opacity]{.mark} as **a right ['for
everyone']{.mark}**]{.underline},83 [this 'right' does **not equate to a
liberal understanding of rights-claims**, where a constituted subject
claims a right that **is accepted and enforced** by **an authority**.
Rather]{.underline}, Glissant's claim is [[an **invitation to resist**
being rendered **transparent**]{.mark} **towards or [by]{.mark} this
[authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Resistance is]{.mark} a kind of
refusal --]{.underline} [[a **refusal to be**]{.mark} **reduced** to an
**[individuated]{.mark} entity**]{.underline}. The refusal of a modern
ontological framing, [which presupposes **the individual subject** as
**a natural starting point**]{.underline}, is one that is highly
generative.

It is from this positionality, as described above, that the 'abyssal'
subject enters the 'nonworld', the non-ontological world of Relation.84
Here, there is no longer an Archimedean point from which the equalizing
or homogenizing projection of law is possible. There is neither an
external nor an internal determination of the other because creolization
produces a world in difference and disunity.85 It denotes an open
encounter with otherness without an assumption of superiority.86
Creolization holds a world of difference in relation, resembling a
chaos-monde, which 'embraces all the elements and forms of expression of
this totality within us; it is totality's act and its fluidity,
totality's reflection and agent in motion'.87

Reading with Glissant, the task of living in the Anthropocene would
conceivably be one of holding, 'giving-on-and-with' in a process 'of
bringing-into-relation',88 which requires that difference be
maintained.89 [**[Black Anthropocene]{.mark}** approaches]{.underline}
that might draw on Black Studies scholars, such as Glissant, [would seek
to **[deconstruct]{.mark}**, to see the **cuts of
[coloniality]{.mark}**[, to offer a **world without fixed
distinctions**,]{.mark} and to **respect the opacity** of differently
situated communities, cultural forms and beings. The Black Anthropocene
is [a **world of 'Relation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or totality in
evolution, [whose order is [**continually in flux** and]{.mark} whose
**[disorder]{.mark}** one can imagine **forever'**]{.underline}.90 The
world without the violence of the cuts of the modern ontology, [the
world as **chaos-monde**, is a world **[without individuated
subjects]{.mark} and distinct entities**]{.underline}. Glissant offers
an 'analytic thought \[that\] makes it possible to continue indefinitely
\[the\] perspective of deferral'.91

[The concern for the Black Anthropocene]{.underline}, posited in this
article, [is [the **making**, **unmaking** and **remaking of the
subject**]{.mark}, **not projection** onto the subject or the
**appropriation** of the subject]{.underline}. There can be no
assumption of living in harmony with the world or finding the world
life-affirming from a position before or above the world. [In the
framework of the Black Anthropocene, **moving [beyond the]{.mark}
[human]{.mark}** [is informed from]{.mark} a **different (non-)subject
positionality**: the experience of **not being a subject before the
world**. This is [the **positionality of the enslaved person**]{.mark},
those **objectified** as **less-than-human**, **'thing-ified'** by
racial capitalism]{.underline}.92

In contrast, the project of constitutionalizing in the Anthropocene
necessarily reproduces the ontological framework of law and
subject/world relations, with its anthropocentric premises. Despite its
problematization of the human subject and objectified world, the logic
is still subject-or human-centred, concerned with apprehending the
(non-human) other. [The Black Anthropocene offers]{.underline} another
logic -- [the **'logic of the other'**]{.underline}.93

[[This mode of]{.mark} alienated [being is]{.mark}]{.underline} what
Sarah Jane Cervenak and J Kameron Carter refer to as
**['[paraontological life']{.mark}]{.underline}**.94 [Non- or
para-ontological life is both [the **fungible material** from
which]{.mark} the modern subject and [**modern ontology** is
constituted, and]{.mark} also [the]{.mark} **potential [site]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} the **[unmaking]{.mark} of these [ontological]{.mark} cuts
and [imaginaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.95 This alternative
positionality or non-subject position is constituted by the violence of
colonial exclusion. Therefore, the experience of being in the world is
unsettling, lacking in ontological security.96 [This mode of life,
[confronted by **unknowability** and **forced to**]{.mark}
**[improvise]{.mark}** and to **invent on the move**]{.underline}, is
captured well in Ronald A Judy's recent magisterial study Sentient
Flesh.97 Whereas theorist Bruno Latour would perhaps be a good example
of someone whose thought might enable constitutionalization, by
emphasizing corrections to modernity in light of ecological catastrophe,
[[the Black Anthropocene]{.underline}]{.mark} differs in that it
**['[unsettles being]{.mark}']{.underline}**. The conceptualization of
[the Black Anthropocene]{.underline}, as articulated here, [emphasizes
forms of life that **disrupt** and **necessarily challenge fixed
understandings of being**, [rather than those that]{.mark} can be
**[instrumentalize]{.mark}d** to enable **modernist modes of being** to
continue]{.underline}.98

To summarize, this article seeks to unearth hidden assumptions of
constitutionalizing approaches to the Anthropocene, which depend upon a
modern ontological grammar. The Black Anthropocene locates this modern
world in the conditions of slavery, coloniality and racial capitalism,
not only in the separation of human from the world in terms of ecology
but also in terms of the dispossession of Black and Indigenous peoples
as well as in the denial of being in relation. Most importantly, this
framing is highly generative for thinking about human rights and the
environment, in that it forwards a non-ontology or para-ontology, rather
than a subject-centred relational ontology. [This **non- or [para-
ontology]{.mark}** [is key]{.mark} to modes of thinking that wish [to
avoid]{.mark} the hubris of extending **[modernist]{.mark} frames** of
[**legal rights**, and]{.mark} thereby refuse an **[ontology]{.mark} of
being**]{.underline}. As Marquis Bey argues:

> a notion of a paraontology \... functions as a critical concept that
> breaks up and desediments. By way of this, it permits the rewriting of
> narratives and the very conditions of understanding the present as
> such. Importantly, [the goal is **not** to create a **different,
> alternative ontology**. [**Paraontology** is not]{.mark} a search for
> [new categories,]{.mark} as if **categorization** is a **neutral
> process**]{.underline}. It is not; [[**categorization** is]{.mark} a
> **mechanism of ontology**, [an **apparatus of
> circumscription**]{.mark}. What the [paraontological suggests]{.mark}
> is [a **dissolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}99

In contrast, the grammar of law and constitutionalization appropriates
entities into legal subjectification. [**The Black Anthropocene**
overtly challenges the assumption [of **individuated entities amenable
to the legal gaze**]{.mark}]{.underline}.100 The assumption of discrete
entities, [as the very condition for **discourses of rights** and
**constitutionalism**]{.underline}, is exactly what cannot be assumed in
approaches categorized here as those of [the Black
Anthropocene]{.underline}. It [is not so much a question of
destabilizing closures or distinctions between entities, but rather of
**deconstructing** or **desedimenting** the processes through which
**certain differences** and **cuts** are seen to be
**natural**]{.underline}. For [the [Black
Anthropocene]{.mark}]{.underline} approach, this undermining [[takes the
form of]{.mark} an [**ontological deconstruction** of]{.mark} the world
to which meaning is given by the **'global colour line'** -- a line
understood as undergirding [modernist binaries]{.mark}]{.underline},101
[[including]{.mark} those of [culture and nature, subject and
object,]{.mark} [human and animal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Thus, **the
world 'after the end of the world of modernity'** is the world [in which
**these**]{.mark} **cuts** and [**violences** can **no longer be
legitimated**]{.mark} or authorized, **[only
disavowed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From this perspective, the desire to
maintain or give new life to the constitutionalizing project is, as
such, a project of disavowal. This is the focus of the third section of
this paper.

#### \*\*RETAG\*\*\-\--We endorse rift work as an onto-epistemic mode of inquiry that exposes the strata of racial hierarchy embedded in the very conception of the human and geologic practice. Our method thinks from broken grounds to inform a type of insurgency that challenges the spatiotemporal coordinates of black and indigenous life, and thus disrupts setter colonial power relations and epistemological practices.

Geology can be thought from many places--- plateau, rift, under- ground,
deep--- spacing time and the world.1 The official and economic archives
of geology speak from the perspectivism of the plateau, the surveyor as
planetary technician and geologic underwriter in cartographies of
extraction and sedimentations of valuation. The grammars of geology cut
away the trauma of extraction and unearthing: what a geographer might
call its spatial affects, what a poet might suggest is its debasement,
crystalline in its exegesis of the world. Geologic life is double-
sided: on one side, the struggle against carceral forms (where the
elemental doubles as the ontological arrangement of property and theft
and an index of value); on the other, a struggle to recognize the full
sense of isomorphic relations that inform the possibility of experience
in an all-too-material world. In this chapter [I advance **a theory of
the rift** as a spatial form and **methodological process**
for]{.underline} understanding the material locatedness of [theorizing,
**against** the epistemic smoothness of **geology** and its
**homogenization** of the elemental.]{.underline}

To reinstate an elemental approach to geology is to elevate property
over personhood, stilling properties in time outside of relation and in
a mono-geography of value (the gold standard). Elemental configuration
can be geologic determinism by other means. Thinking the elementary as
difference and locating concepts in their historical geographies, [I
develop the rift as **a place and perspective** from which to understand
**the vertigo of geologic relations**. The rift]{.underline} as a
topographic zone of the earth's surface [is a site]{.underline} that is
[**pulled apart** by the flex of extensional tectonics]{.underline} in
the mantle of the lithosphere [exhibiting what is materially **buried**
and what is **uplifted** to the surface.]{.underline}

Rifts are the basis of stratigraphic exposure!

[Rifts expose the **uneven geographies** of exposure and the
**geophysics of geologic agency**.]{.underline}2 In geologic
terminology, a rift is a zone where the lithosphere is being torn apart,
a site of the ruptures between different states of the earth (and their
attendant social and environmental strata). Living through deeply rifted
social and environmental realities, in the context of many broken
earths, **[rift theorizing]{.underline}** might address the inchoate
languages and material transformations that break and [**build worlds of
resistance** to the unceasing transformation of the surface of the world
into property. **Rift theorizing**]{.underline} might be likened to
geophysical fissures as a route to [**confront the dehumanizing shocks
of broken earths.**]{.underline} Acting as an indifferent terraforming
force, colonialists and settler colonialists visited violent new
geophysical relations on the people they encountered, encoding the earth
in necropolitical languages of matter, and wrenching entire worlds of
being from relation. [The rift is a way of reading across]{.underline}
these [**broken grounds** and attending to specific place-based
**reparative work** that practices **divergent imaginations** of
material engagements.]{.underline}

[I imagine **rift work** as an open-ended set of questions]{.underline}
and placements [that begin from a situatedness in broken places and
**think from** that **brokenness without** the promise of **the plateau
or its telos**. Rift work]{.underline} might be something less
prescriptive than the social sciences usually demand but [offers a way
to think **race and geology** together, as an embedded set of geographic
and geophysical relations made in **fractured colonial
afterlives**.]{.underline} Rather than posit the trajectories of origins
and endings, [the rift can be more usefully thought of as **a
methodology of uneven geographies and unstable grounds**]{.underline}
(ontologically and materially) [that are found in the **archives of
geologic life** as footnote, fragment, suppression, aesthetic, poetics,
and affect.]{.underline}3 [**Riftwork recognizes** broken grounds not in
service to the **settler colonial** **surface of power** and its **modes
of (de)valuation**. Such rents in the **epistemological archives** and
**material affective infrastructures** point to other geologic lives
that are overlooked and unheard on the plateau.]{.underline}

Rather than singular sites of origination, where the plateau is
perceived as goal and arrival, **[the rift]{.underline}** (as a concept
and place) [is a way of geographically attending to the power structures
that differently **press down or levitate racial difference** as a
gravitational field of relation, as well as contributing to the analysis
of **racial regimes of property** and the **sedimentation of whiteness**
and its longitudinal affects.]{.underline} If the trouble with
pluralizing and multiversing in social theory is that it accumulates
difference, often without accounting for its weight of power and
violence, then [the rift gives a spatial dimension to racial formations
and extends]{.underline} the temporality of [the fracture in its
terrains as an ongoing material condition and **insurgent rebellion
across space and time.**]{.underline} As a site of extraction and
leverage, as well as an extended view into the stratal planes of
pressure and the histories of violence that surface disavows, [the rift
speaks to]{.underline} the accumulative weight of the Overseer's earth.
In this sense, the rift might be thought of as a prismatic space of
grind that may build things in quiet revolutions of the earth.

Throughout this book I engage [**epistemic processes** that have a
**counter-gravity to fossilization and stratification**]{.underline} (as
the empirical bases of geology and the modes of petrifying social forms)
[as strategy to **desediment white geology**]{.underline}. In human
origins theory, the term ghost populations refers to unknown ancient
humans (often ancient Africans and unknowable hominids that have no
fossil referent) whose genetic marker is carried in contemporary humans
but who are without an originary genealogy or recognizable identity
trace.4 Which is to say that the ghosts of geology are not-fossil; the
unrecorded, unclaimed, illegitimate, and illegible geologic lives of
those who occupy the footnotes and rift, in the margins of the script of
genealogical narratives, and in the under grounds of colonial scripts of
becoming human. I imagine [the **insurgent geology of the
rift**]{.underline} as something like Glissant's " going-on-and-with
that [opens finally on totality"]{.underline} (1997, 192). " Going on
[and]{.underline} with" [speaks to the ways in which diasporic histories
are yoked together but also to how]{.underline} this structure of
[**colonial geologic life** has within it its own undoings]{.underline}
that are evidenced in [both **a refusal to be flattened** by this
violence and a recognition of the instability of these categories that
require constant work to maintain their (subjugating) operability. If we
think about **the inhuman** in its **liberatory solidarities** rather
than just its subjugating modes, it is also a way to make and develop
**a politics of stratal rift solidarities** against the oppressive use
of **geopower** in the configuration of subjective life as **carceral
and coercive**. That opening on totality is]{.underline}, then, also
[the poetic heart of an **affirmative geology**]{.underline}, as a
cosmic incitement in an expanding universe:

It is like what we imagine knowledge to be: dark, salt, clear, moving,
utterly free, drawn from the cold hard mouth of the world, derived from
the rocky breasts forever, flowing and drawn, and since our knowledge is
historical, flowing, and flown. (Bishop 1979, 66)

When I began this project, methodologically I had thought I was
interested in processes of fossilization and future fossils.5 It turned
out that the opposite was true. If fossils are knots in the narrative of
making a world--- a genealogical claim on time--- then not-fossils are
what exists in the shadow of those claims to identity, ghosting, but no
less part of how worlds come into being. Non-fossils are the orphans of
geography. In this chapter I (1) explicate the conjoined history of the
plateau and the rift as spatial and social forms of life that are
onto-epistemic and material; (2) show how the liminal and the lithic are
joined through a geophysics of sense that functions as a racial coda of
space;6 and (3) suggest that [**rift theory** is a way to both **take
account** of the **sedimented histories** of the colonial life of
geology and **mobilize the fissures of the rift** for destabilizing work
to **break** with these **racialized inheritances.**]{.underline}

Methodologically, the figure of [the rift is a way to access the
**repressed architectures** of the surface and activate new ways of
seeing **liminality as a form of lithic subjectivity and placement**
(which shifts the geographies of attention and means of intervention).
To break the filial bonds of race and environment requires not just the
**end of grammars of extraction** but also the **dismantling of the
stratal imagination of the surface**]{.underline} as it is constituted
through a lithic (de)arrangement of the plateau and the rift. [Staying
on and with the rift is a commitment to]{.underline} beginning to
[**dismantle the white supremacy of matter** through **rerouting the
grammars of geology** and working to disassemble its accrual of
value.]{.underline} This dismantling is done in the context of an earth
whose colonial rift economies have intensified the propagation of
planetary tears in the time and space of the earth processes, turning
the geologic oven on high in the form of climate change.

#### Our method is a refusal of exploration, development, and the state's right to map or manage the Arctic. Insurgent geologies resist the epistemic violence of white geology by foregrounding inhuman modes of relation---Black and Indigenous ecologies that persist outside the logic of recognition, utility, and governance. The ballot affirms our flight from the world the resolution assumes is worth saving.

Understanding geology as a material and symbolic mode of relation,
coconstituted by imaginative, geophysical, affective, and political
economies, I employ aesthetics as a guiding analytic and methodological
mode; a mode of capturing and practicing **[insurgent
geologies]{.underline}** that [**work against** the classification,
geo-logics, and **grammars in the mastery of matter**]{.underline}.
Aesthetics is not deployed in its Western form as representational but
as [a "rift zone" of sense-theorizing]{.underline}.11 I use aesthetics
not as a visual or scopic regime per se that makes certain presumptions
about unified planes of perception (per Jacques Rancière's "just out of
reach" political possibility in the "distributions of the sensible" that
maintains a colonial monism or plateau in its political aesthetics; see
Yusoff 2018b, 266).12 Rather, I use it to [denote the bundle of senses,
perceptions, poetics, and imaginations that embody an affective
architectural structure (like gravity) that]{.underline} I call the
geophysics of sense. Another geophysics [**exists beyond** the political
aesthetics of **colonial materialisms**]{.underline} that is already on
the run, tapping into the cosmic---a historically informed rift praxis
of sense-theorizing epistemic modes, temporalizing otherwise on the
wrong side of categories, and caught between executing grammars.

[Resisting epistemes of extraction]{.underline} that grammar political
forms [requires promiscuous interdisciplinarity that disrupts the
stabilization and sedimentation of]{.underline} those [colonial
geo-logics. This]{.underline} gathering [can be called **the
Inhumanities**, a counterconceptualization of the
geohumanities]{.underline} in the context of the Anthropocene
(understood as the consequential outcome of colonial earth) [that
**foregrounds the role of the inhuman**]{.underline} (as it was
established through an epistemic plateau that privileged an extractive
account of matter that racialized and predated on the
subjective-environment relation). Wynter has made the point that
humanism is the selection of who can function as a political subject. It
is my contention that this "functioning" of political subjectivity has a
prior mode operationalized in the realm of geology, as both the temporal
ground that subtends biocentric racisms and the actual earth that is the
medium of extraction's exchange by which subjects are marked and made.

In Julietta Singh's 2018 work Unthinking Mastery, she puts forward an
argument for dehumanisms as a critical mode for decentering the white
patriarchal subject and dislodging the tyranny of the white settler
family, and of mastery itself. This might be understood as the mythos of
"white man's burden," or, in the age of the Anthropocene and its
vertical geographies, white man's overburden. Of dehumanism, Singh says:
"Dehumanism requires not an easy repudiation and renunciation of
dehumanization but a form of radical dwelling in and with dehumanization
through the narrative excesses and insufficiencies of the 'good'
human---a cohabitation that acts on and through us in order to imagine
other forms of political allegiance" (2018, 4). In the shifting of
"inhumanisms" to "dehumanisms," Singh seeks to overcome a prefix that
does not, she says, "intuitively signal the history of the making of
nonhuman subjects and forms of being" (5). Singh's project of unlearning
and unmaking of narrative forms of mastery is compelling, gathering
together dehumanism and the decolonial in a way that connects the reach
of colonial mastery across domains to highlight the "denial of the
master's own dependency on other bodies" (10). Singh's shift of inhuman-
ism to dehumanism is a useful reminder in terms of addressing the
legacies of colonialism, as it shifts attention from the racial schema
of whiteness as a category of mere accumulation to sharpen a focus on
the attachment to supremacy that propels whiteness as a distinct
formation and grammar. My own persistence with the term [**inhumanism**
is]{.underline} (as with my title of professor of inhuman geography)
precisely [to work **against the intuitive, to grasp its nonnormative
workings and to let in**]{.underline}, as it were, [**its cosmic
potential** alongside the inhumane geographies that are the discipline's
legacy. It is an inoculation in the whiteness of human geography. **The
colonial history of inhumanism generated and languaged a crossing of the
abysmal divide between the human and inhuman, and it launched a space in
which a new language was born to speak otherwise of this inhuman
condition.** **The inhumanities**]{.underline} (contra humanities)
[would be deeply interested in the stretch of the geophysical world in
the **making of spaces of freedom and investigating the conditions for
thinking materially about decolonization as a geologic
process.**]{.underline}

The assimilatory logic of the Anthropocene further perpetuates the idea
of "unthought" destruction and unforeseen consequences of environmental
change. **[Acknowledging how geology participates in Black, Brown, and
Indigenous life-forms through compression, deformation, and inundation
is crucial to challenging]{.underline}** the antecedent **[colonial
earth and shaping the earth that gets made.]{.underline}** The inhumane
politics of Europe, the Caribbean, Asia, Pacific, and Americas that
travel in [the grammar of the inhuman]{.underline} (as geology and
subject/object agregation) **[need to be at the center]{.underline}**,
not the margin, **[of any reckoning with the earth]{.underline}** as a
new epoch is ushered in, [lest it carries forth the grammars that
nihilated identity and turned Black and Brown subjects into a geologic
buffer]{.underline} for the force of the earth itself. As a racialized
stratum that breaks the waves of hurricanes and absorbs the forces of
mining's materiality (as explosion, police, exhaustion, and poison),
this stratal positionality is materially locked into carceral and
captured states of being, policed by languages of devaluation. [A
connection can be drawn that bridges disalienation and extractive
grammars to rethink the relation between subjective life and the earth;
to reorient the spatiotemporal structures of geology toward a tense
cognizance of its histories and their futures in the full ledger of
relation.]{.underline}13

Hewn by the geographies of mines and plantations, the first Anthropocene
subjects occupied the indices and intramural spaces of geologic
practices as integral to the destratification of energy and value. I
argued in A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None (2018a) that white
geology has Indigenous, Black, and Brown understrata, because in every
sphere of its production as discipline, practice, and ecological
relation, it is Indigenous, Black, and Brown subjects who have been
violently subjugated within the subtending strata of the extraction
industries, extinction drives, and climate change.14 Geology structured
material and social relations through its stratigraphic and genealogic
methods (such as hierarchies, social strata, historicity) and its
material processes (extraction, isolation, removal of value, etc.). The
work of time (temporal arrangements) carried both narratives and
normativities of these formations into the present. Given the way that
universalizing claims to Humanity, Species Life, and Biocentric Life are
being revitalized in the Anthropocene and the agency of fossil fuels,
capital, or Anthropos prioritized, the long shadow of diasporic and
complicated histories of colonial earth obliges a commitment against
forgetting what was erased in the history of the earth story.15
Especially when those geologies still radiate their harm down the
petrochemical corridors of the Southern states; through the hurricanes
of the Gulf Coast and Caribbean; in the displaced murders of Indigenous
environmental leaders by militias funded by oil companies or mining in
Guatemala, Brazil, Latin America, the Niger Delta; in the disappearance
of Indigenous women in fracking zones in North Dakota; and through the
many muscular relations of extractive industries that send young people
from Yên Thành, Vietnam, to untimely deaths outside of London. Names
like Katrina, Puerto Rico, Flint, Haiti that have all become synonymous
with the twinned violence of racialized subjective-ecological relations
highlight the continuing refusal of state recognition of Indigenous,
Black, and Brown subjects within the material context of the commons.
This agentic exclusion from value coupled with violent inclusion might
be understood as a stratigraphic inhumanism. Anti-Blackness, settler
colonialism, and neocolonialism. [**Questions about the costs of the
stabilization of whiteness need to be at the center of debates about the
Anthropocene because these dynamics continue to configure environmental
pressures and gendered and sexual exposures, and so constitute the shape
of violence unleashed by anthropogenic climate change and destabilizing
earth processes.** Geology is not an abstract axis of materialization
but pressures the very geophysics of living in the day for those
marginalized by and in its praxis.]{.underline}

[Extending spatial analysis into geology]{.underline}---as temporal
dimensionality---[is a way to understand the inhuman as a structural
plateau and a geophysical affect. Geophysics introduces]{.underline}
time and its ordering into the equation as a material question:
[temporal delineations associated with different beings, the naming and
appearances of different qualities of time, as arrival, teleological,
cosmic, racialized, humanist, reproductive, annihilation, and natality.
This]{.underline}, in turn, [constructs an affectual infrastructure that
conditions the tense of space and its social ordering through epistemes
of materiality.]{.underline}16 In the context of the twinned
temporalization and racialization of colonial earth, the geostory
secures the priority of European Man and interns "his" Other in/as
matter of the earth, categorized for extraction and ascribed atemporally
historical stasis. As the work of Black (Sylvia Wynter,17 Katherine
McKittrick,18 Denise Ferreira da Silva, for example) and Indigenous
geographers (Audra Simpson, Kyle Powys Whyte \[2018\], for example) have
shown, conjoined histories of place emerge in the making of time's
(subjective) objects at this metaphoric and material juncture of
colonialism. While the imposition of colonial and settler time is well
attended to, how deep time functioned as a way of producing universality
and flattening difference, while simultaneously remaking it along a
racializing axis (through affectual architectures), punctuated by
different racial "arrivals," eludes scrutiny. It is this casual and
raced production of universality via species life and deep time (a
diagram of geologic time is sufficient to show this totality) that makes
its forceful return in the future-perfect, postracial "we" of the
Anthropocene.19

One way to come at extraction is through political ecology/economy and
the histories, infrastructures, and materialities of extraction
practices that group under petropolitics, mining, energy humanities,
and, more recently, political geology (where empirically based studies
do the work of making visible the spatial effects, labor politics,
environmental consequences, and commodity chains involved in extractive
economies). Another is to look at how extraction touches down in
hyperlocalized geosocial contexts and map out from there to show the
politics of matter in process. [**Geologic Life** differs from these
approaches by **examining the ontologies** and materialisms **of the
"ground" of earth forged by colonialism** rather than taking for granted
neither its pregiven stability nor its spatial forms. With a
methodological focus on fracture sites, the disruption of material
languages and inhuman counterstories, my approach involves a broad
interdisciplinary drift and epistemic experimentation to interrogate the
agile scope of totalizing geologic grammars and relations.]{.underline}
What I take from the work of Glissant's concept of the archipelago,
Wynter's (n.d.) theorizing of "replantation" in "Black Metamorphosis:
New Natives in a New World," McKittrick's (2006) Demonic Grounds, Leanne
Betasamosake Simpson's (2014) "Land as Pedagogy," and Povinelli's (2016)
Karrabing analytics is that shifting ontological ground conditions are a
means to epistemic and other freedoms. McKittrick's discussion of
Wynter's cartographic theoretical approach is instructive here: ["Her
work is **anchored** **to multiple and multiscalar 'grounds'**---
demonic grounds, **the space of Otherness, the grounds of being human**,
poverty archipelagos, archipelagos of human Otherness, les damnés de la
terre / the wretched of the earth, the color-line, terra nullis / lands
of no one"]{.underline} (McKittrick 2006, 123).

[**The "grounds" of geologic life are** similarly **displaced over
multiple geographies, geophysics, and genres, in the gritty margin**
(rift) **between categories.** **The refusal of monogeographic space
disrupts the fiction of a singular plane of material existence or
experience.** If the Enlightenment subject was materialized through
racial violence to float above the earth in a universal plane, then
**epistemologies of grounding must be concerned with disrupting the
account of spatial forms to make visible the spatial architectures that
operationalize geologies of race.**]{.underline} Every building a mine.
Tilting the axis to stay with the affective force of the geo-logics that
ground an idea and arrangement of the earth is to examine how these
grammars operate through a stratigraphic imagination that is pushing
against the specificity of locales, both materially and ontologically,
toward a totality of geophysical conditions. **[To theorize from such a
point is a way to disrupt the taxa and temporality of geologic life as
governed by the extraction principle.]{.underline}**

If the plateau represents the political aesthetics of monospatiality,
**[the rift confirms the multiplicity of epistemologies of experience in
engaging dimensionality]{.underline}** (as a relation between rift and
plateau, underground and surfacing). [**Thinking geology by way of Black
feminist studies** has **focused** my attention on the **revaluation of
subjective life outside of existing modes of valuation to disrupt the
formations, communicability, and modes of fungibility.**]{.underline}
Jared Sexton sugests that ["**Black life** is not lived in the world
that the world lives in, but it **is lived underground**"]{.underline}
(2011, 28). [Understanding the racial undergrounds generated in current
grammars of geologic life as a concrete expression of geology and its
originary racial geophysics, I seek to expand the spatial and material
dynamics under consideration to disrupt colonial earth's
continuance.]{.underline} Nonequivalence in processes of valuation of
matter locates this work because it is the process of categorization and
valuation of geologic materials (broadly conceived) that greases the
machines of extraction and their violent relocations of subjects,
ecologies, and earth. [Drawing sources from counterarchives and
underground spaces of geology is a way to demonstrate colonization
across its grammars and render the spatial scope of those
relations]{.underline} (as plateau)[, while simultaneously refusing to
reinstate the "unthought" on the margin]{.underline} (McKittrick 2006,
135). [To that end, I move through and beyond current grammars of
geology conceptualized in a narrow frame of resource extraction,
political economy, and (white) new materialisms]{.underline} (see Broeck
2018, 178--95) [into other ledgers and poetics of apprehension that
acknowledge and attempt to disrupt, what Sexton]{.underline} (2011) [has
called the "economy of disposability" of Black life. In geology,
**thinking with the rift as the unthought in the production of the
social order is a map to other affective geologies that might indicate
passages toward less subjugating and full reckonings with geologic
lives.**]{.underline}

#### Geo-power isn't biopower, your defense is irrelevant

Inhumanism and the Biopolitical", *Theory, Culture & Society*, Vol. 34,

NC and KY: You recently used [the **notion of ['geopower']{.mark}**
[as]{.mark}]{.underline} a way of [characterizing **[the geological,
inhuman]{.mark} and preindividuated [forces]{.mark}** [that
**subtend**]{.mark} and **provoke organic [life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For many readers, the obvious counterpart, or perhaps counterpoint, to
geopower will be Foucault's concept of biopower -- which is to say to a
specific set of technologies or strategies for managing bodies. For many
social scientists, in particular, Foucauldian notions of biopower and
the biopolitical have been taken to imply that it is no longer possible
to speak of biology in any way other than as an object of human
political ordering. All of which seems very different from what your
concept of geopower seems to be setting out to do. Could you say more
about the relationship between biopower and geopower?

EG: I don't think I introduced the concept of geopower at all! I seem to
recall it from Foucault's work, especially his 'Questions on Geography'
(Foucault, 1980), which was for me a very important text insofar as it
introduced the idea that geography is itself the object of power
relations. [I **don't think it is analogous** to his concept of
**biopower**, which addresses]{.underline} precisely [the **social
regulation** of **bodies** and **their actions**,]{.underline} their
positioning in a grid [through which power can **regulate** and
**normalize**]{.underline} the **[behaviour]{.underline}** of bodies.
For him, biopower regulates a body from the outside: it is a body, or
many bodies, insofar as they intersect with and are transformed by
institutions and their requirements. One could use a different concept
of biopower than the one Foucault developed, if one wishes to produce a
greater symmetry between biopower and geopower than he does: this would
require biopower to be considered not only as a body insofar as it is
regulated by historically specific forms of power, but the powers of a
body, in principle unknowable to the extent that we do not know what a
body can do. In other words, biopower could be understood as the powers
that operate in and through living bodies, the powers of a body that can
be harnessed for particular forms of action and passion. This would draw
it closer to his own concept of geopower, the powers of the earth that
may enable life to survive. Rather than concede geopower as the power
that humans can extract from or hold over the geological, he sees
geopower as the forces of the earth. In many ways, it is probably
Deleuze and Guattari -- and their depersonalized (and some say
depoliticized) conception of power as forces that run through things --
who have been responsible for a more geological focus, in some kind of
alliance with Foucault, who are philosophers who have enabled us to
address not only space but, above all, the earth as the coagulation of
various forces, organized by the plane of planes, as constructions by
life that address the living forces of the earth. Deleuze and Guattari
have insisted on the irreducibility of the geological, not only as a
stratified diagram of the real, but also as the condition for the excess
of energy beyond identity that marks every living thing with the milieus
or environments that make them possible and link them together.

In brief, I agree that Foucault's concept of [**biopower** [is **very
different** from]{.mark}]{.underline} his (and Deleuze and Guattari's)
concept of [**geopower**. **[Biopower]{.mark}** is]{.underline}, for
Foucault, [[the **power over life** that regulates it **from
outside**]{.mark}; but [**geopower** has **no outside**]{.mark}, **no
'place'** [or]{.mark} **'time' [before or beyond it]{.mark}**[: it is
**the**]{.mark} **force**, the **[forces, of]{.mark} the
[earth]{.mark}** itself]{.underline}: forces
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} we as technical [[humans have tried to
**organize**, **render**]{.mark} **consistent** and
**[predictable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but which we can never fully
accomplish insofar as the earth remains the literal ground and condition
for every human, and non-human, action.

Following the lead of Black studies scholars, [negation should never be
totalized]{.underline} (see, for example, Hazel Carby and Saidiya
Hartman), not least [because this would]{.underline} be to [doubly
impose dereliction and repudiate the achievements of endurance in
conditions without consent.]{.underline} Fred Moten argues: "For various
reasons that are historically specific, [this condition of not being a
subject]{.underline}, of not being a citizen, of not being a
self-possessed and self-possessing normative person [is associated with
blackness]{.underline}" (2016, 30), [but this "nothingness is not
emptiness]{.underline}. . . . I believe that in that displacement, in
that no- place and it's \[sic\] off time, [there's
something]{.underline} there--- something is there [in
nothingness"]{.underline} (21). [That something in the nothing is
historically evidenced by aesthetic and theoretical
reserves]{.underline} that have been developed in the occupation of the
inhuman by those that have lived and live this space-time, contingencies
[that radically reorganize the terms of devaluation in this
subjugation]{.underline} as a politics of countergravity. Part of that
something is the simple fact of geography, of the specificity of time
and space in a shared place. [While anti-Black and antiBrown violence
animates the (non)relation of the inhuman, it is not its only antagonism
or its only path]{.underline}. In the temporal dissonance of the
achronistic freedoming of space and time, [a methodology of]{.underline}
occupation with [the inhuman was established]{.underline}. [Resisting
the humanist impulse for restorative category work or the fantasy of
epistemic reparation to these harms]{.underline}, stratal readjustment
and the reallocation of geopower might go some way to alleviating the
pressure.

The inhuman, then, is an occupied (subjective) category of language,
epistemes, and earth. In the parse of matter and (non)being, the terms
of that occupation are by no means given and the racial disfigurement of
geology is not its only gravity. As scholarship in [Black studies pushes
the contours of the inhuman as a metaphysical dimension of]{.underline}
forms of [Black life]{.underline}, I want to contribute an examination
of matter and racial materialisms to substantiate a reckoning with the
geophysics of race and racialized geologic futurisms.

### AT: Extinction

#### [Extinction inevitable]{.underline} and is [already occurring]{.underline} for Black people, [accepting]{.underline} it breaks down humanist ties to *this* world that produced the Anthropocene.

Claire **Colebrook 22**, Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English,
Philosophy, and Women\'s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Penn State
University, "Extinction and the Anthropocene: to End or Mend the World?
A Conversation with Claire Colebrook," *New Formations*, vol. 107-108,
https://muse.jhu.edu/article/881501, DJDubb

In a suite of recent books, including Death of the PostHuman, Sex After
Life and the co-written Twilight of the Anthropocene Idols, [Claire
Colebrook has placed the problem of extinction at the heart of
philosophy and cultural studies. [**The human** and **its world** are
**not to be saved**]{.mark} **from extinction**]{.underline}, she
contends. [[Rather]{.mark}, the encounter with [**extinction**
might]{.mark} just **[detach us from the human]{.mark}**, with [its
**false universalism**]{.mark}, its **[ceaseless]{.mark} production,
[consumption and extraction]{.mark}**, its bounded and constrained self,
family and society, [allowing]{.mark} for [a **new fidelity** to
planetary life]{.mark} in all its complexity]{.underline}. We at New
Formations were therefore keen to interview Claire for this special
issue, Living with Extinction: After the Tipping Point, to explore
together themes arising from the problem of saving or ending the human
and its world.

Currently appointed as Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English at Penn
State University, Colebrook has developed her critique of humanist
thinking over thirty years of research and publishing on visual art and
culture, queer theory, literature, poetry and film, and the philosophy
of Gilles Deleuze. Her critique of the humanities also informs her
engagement with new models of publishing, as co-editor of the
influential series Critical Climate Change at the open-access Open
Humanities Press. This New Formations interview was conducted by email
in Spring-Summer 2022, shortly before publication of her latest book,
Who Would You Kill to Save the World? A book about post-apocalyptic
cinema, the title is not an ethical injunction, but a symptom of the
problem to be overcome.

New Formations: Thank you very much for agreeing to contribute to this
special issue on 'living with extinction' by responding to questions
your writing on this topic has raised for us. Can we begin by asking
what 'extinction' means to you: in what ways do you use the concept? You
have written repeatedly, and admonishingly, of a human 'inability to
confront the imminent demise of life' (whether precipitated by
catastrophic climate change, nuclear warfare, bio-weapons, viral
pandemics or resource depletion) and you describe this as a 'strange
incapacity to ask the question of life. That is: [now that life appears
to be **in danger of disappearance**]{.underline}, diminution or
mutation beyond recognition, [living humans indulge both in greater and
greater insistence on the **sanctity of life**, and seem **incapable of
directly confronting** the intensifying threats that menace the
present]{.underline}.'1 Accordingly, in your forthcoming book, Who Would
You \[End Page 198\] Kill to Save the World?2, you analyse the scenarios
of post-apocalyptic cinema as so many ruses of self-deception and
distraction from that direct 'confrontation' with 'the question of
life'. This raises the question of what you think looking extinction
full in the face might possibly entail -- [what would follow from
[confronting]{.mark} unflinchingly [the **valuelessness**
(and]{.mark}]{.underline} hence, paradoxically, [the [**culpability**)
of **human**]{.mark} **species-[life]{.mark}** [and its **humanistic
conceptions**]{.mark} **of life**]{.underline} in se? Would it be
Olympian indifference, political despair, programmatic species-suicide?
Or would it entail precisely the kinds of ameliorative projects --
ameliorative life-behaviours of our species-being and its relations with
other life-forms -- that you seem inclined to view as rearrangements of
deckchairs on the Titanic, diversions from a catastrophic confrontation
with 'the question of life' or humanity's questionable 'right to life'?
And who is the 'we' of whom you write in this context, given a humanity
divided by countless inequalities of power, wealth and opportunity?
Would confrontation with 'the question of life' entail something
different for, say, a Harvard philosopher and a Bangladeshi peasant with
five children to feed?

Claire Colebrook:

If I use a simple sense of 'our' inability to confront our non-being
(which I often do!), this 'we' needs to be qualified. It is what Derrida
referred to as the 'silent presupposed we' of (for him) European
philosophy. The inability I refer to can be historically and politically
delimited. This is what I am trying to write about in my book on
fragility: [the more secure we become, the more unthinkable contingency,
volatility and non-being become. **[Accepting]{.mark}** that [this world
will end (**regardless of whether it should**]{.mark} **or not**) [would
be **the first step**]{.mark} **to living well**. [Rather than]{.mark} a
**state of [emergency]{.mark}** [where everything is done to **save the
world** -- including]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[wars]{.mark}** that
save the West [and]{.mark} the **internal [propping up]{.mark} of [the
state]{.mark}** [and **markets**]{.mark} because of a **'too big to
fail' logic** -- [one might ask **what might be possible at the end
of**]{.mark} **(or without) [this world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, Jonathan Crary's recent Scorched Earth argues for a future
without the internet, but there are many other positive imaginary
futures of stateless societies.3 [There's a **literal sense** in which
'we' face extinction]{.underline} -- of humans as a species -- [and then
a **broader sense** in which 'we']{.underline} (as private subjects of
modern state societies) [are witnessing the end of our
world]{.underline}. Contemplating the idea/fact that [humans are a
**fragment** in a broader cosmos]{.underline} might have practical
philosophical merit in creating some degree of detachment from the
highly specific world to which we are attached.

NF:

Are you, then, using 'extinction' in two different ways, to signify
extinction of the human species as such and extinction of the life-world
to which it has accustomed itself, and suggesting that the threat of the
former could precipitate the latter? In other words, are you [inviting
us to entertain the possibility of the survival of (an albeit changed)
human species beyond the Anthropocene -- a subsequent era in which [our
species **takes a back seat**, as it]{.mark}]{.underline} were, [accepts
and [lives its status as **a fragment, no longer 'master of the
planet'**]{.mark}]{.underline}? Is this (hard to imagine) possibility
also what the 'degrowth' agenda tries to envisage? And, incidentally,
what grounds are there for hoping that 'accepting that \[End Page 199\]
this world will end \... would be the first step to living well', rather
than to living very badly indeed, more recklessly and self-centredly
than ever before?

CC:

I am deliberately not using extinction in two senses, or deliberately
being vague and confusing about the difference between [species
extinction]{.underline} (which [is **a certainty** at some
point]{.underline}) and the end of humanism or the global sense of 'us'
as a single species, because [what counts as humanity and the
**[end]{.mark} that is [feared]{.mark}** [is **not the species
but**]{.mark} **the species in a [self-recognising form]{.mark}**. If we
think of all]{.underline} the [humans]{.underline} that
[ever]{.underline} existed, [and then all]{.underline} the [humans who
had a sense of themselves as subjects with distinctly human rights tied
to all other humans also blessed with rights, the two circles of the
Venn diagram **overlap but do not coincide**]{.underline}. Not only is
[[the human of human rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, crimes against
humanity, humanities and humanitarian causes [**[not]{.mark} the same**
as [the species]{.mark}]{.underline} -- such that we can imagine Homo
sapiens before and after the Anthropos of the Anthropocene -- [it's the
**impossibility of a clear distinction** that is both fruitful and
horrifying for the future. The very idea of nomadic statelessness seems
intolerable and yet the **[erasure]{.mark}** of that possibility [**in
the name of the human** has]{.mark} **ended so many worlds** and
**[produced]{.mark} so [many extinctions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I am
deliberately using both senses -- humans as a species, humans as
'humanity' -- because that indistinction is already in play. At the same
time, I am trying to find moments that imagine the human species in
modes that are not human. This would include the degrowth agenda, and
many possibilities that go beyond, or stop short of, the degrowth
agenda. Quite concretely, [[accepting]{.mark} that this [world will
end]{.mark} would **[shift attention]{.mark} away** from attempts to
save the banks, save the housing market, save the humanities, save the
stock market, save areas of wilderness, save America, save the
constitution, and so on]{.underline}. The problem is how [[individuals
have been **captured** by]{.mark} these **['too big to fail'
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but there are community abolition
movements of refusal that are starting to disinvest from the state. It's
true that individuals can do only so much, and ecological imperatives
for us all to do our bit by recycling, or buying local, or reducing our
footprint do little when one compares this to huge corporations.
Nevertheless, the neoliberal imperative that we all are driven by some
ethic of self-maximisation does not exhaust forms of social relation and
collectivity that are increasingly refusing profit and extraction.
**[One can [say no]{.mark}]{.underline}** to global forms of extraction.

[As environmental concern and]{.underline} the designation of [**the
Anthropocene** foster new interdisciplinary configurations]{.underline}
in the environmental and geohumanities, underpinned by targeted funding
and programs, [**the human** is **often taken for granted** as **an
accomplice**]{.underline} in the designation of a field of concern, [as
**the planet** is taken as a **presumed arena of action**]{.underline}.
Although climate change and mass transformation of the planetary
geochemical systems do indeed call for a new understanding of the
commons beyond geopolitical configurations of nation states, such modes
of existence need scrutiny for how they mobilize geophysical changes of
state to make new ontological claims on behalf of the elemental,
volumetric, or subterranean, while [erasing the historical forms of
**material differentiation**]{.underline} that constitute the livability
[and **modes of extinction** that result in the "**systemic
inferiorization of black and of other non-white peoples of the
earth**"]{.underline} (Wynter 2000, 200). [**[The human]{.mark}** as a
**metaphysical--empirical concept** [is materially constituted
through]{.mark} the **[scientific racism]{.mark} of
paleontology**]{.underline} in the seventeenth through nineteenth
centuries [[and]{.mark} the **geographies of [colonialism]{.mark}** that
formed its praxis]{.underline}, a praxis [[that **divided the human**
into]{.mark} its **subcategories** of **human**, [**subhuman**, and
**inhuman**]{.mark}, to **extract** and **control**]{.underline} the
surface and subsurface of [the earth. **Racialized
populations**]{.underline} thus [became **a means** to justify and
govern this theft of persons and land]{.underline}. In the rush to
secure white settler futurity (see Smith and Vasudevan 2017; Erickson
2020) in the context of environmental and climate change, the emergent
field of [Anthropocene studies]{.underline} and the
environmental/geohumanities often [**assumes** rather than
problematizing **the human**]{.underline} that secures the concept of
humanities at both a philosophical and epistemic level, [disregarding
**the historical colonial geographies** that]{.underline} materially
[delivered **humanism**, its structures of thought]{.underline} (the
human and its "others" and in parallel the discourse of nature and its
"others"), [its organization of value]{.underline} (philosophy of
natural philosophy, ethics, and racial capitalism), [and its scientific
and industrial institutions]{.underline} (that were funded, and thereby
grounded, in the financial spoils of imperial enterprise).2 As data from
the UCL Legacies of British Slave-ownership3 project has made abundantly
clear, the financial payout to slave owners during abolition underpinned
the Industrial Revolution in Britain and facilitated the development of
its modes of capitalist production,4 carbon economies, and scientific
and educational institutions. Slavery thereby realized both the material
transformation of the United Kingdom and its colonies and secured the
establishment of its knowledge production and dissemination within
global geographies.

Although pressure has been put on the figure of the human, its
historicity, racialized, gendered, and sexualized forms (Wynter 2003;
Walcott 2014; Jackson 2020), it is not just a hermeneutics of the human
that is needed (e.g., from colonial man to Anthropocene man,
mastersubject "Man" to matter-subject "Anthropos") but, alongside, an
unearthing of the very ground that materially constitutes the figure of
the human through an examination of what might be termed the geologies
of race. Geologies of race is a way to understand the conjoined material
praxis of colonial terra- and subjectforming, its geosocial relation
(Clark and Yusoff 2017), and its legacies in the present. The material
incorporation of **[[the European subject]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and
its settler colonial kin) in terms of value, accumulation, and
subjective forms [[was defined against]{.mark} what was classified as
**fossil nature** ([**indigeneity**)]{.mark} and **fossil energy**
[(**the enslaved**]{.mark})]{.underline} to transform the ecological and
energetic organization of the world as a global geography. As **[the
Anthropocene]{.underline}** empirically describes a new field of
geologically informed power relations that focuses attention on the
geographies of the inhuman, geologic forces, and the politics of
nonlife, it also [represents an explicit]{.underline} formation of
[**political geology** that is **racialized**]{.underline} from its
onset in the geologies of colonialism since 1492 (Lewis and Maslin 2015;
Yusoff 2018c). My argument is not just about the recognition of
geographies of colonialization as a spatial apparatus but [as a set of
**interlocking affectual architectures** and **geophysical relations**
that constitute an **antiblack and colonial earth** in the present
tense.]{.underline}

The Inhuman and the Anthropocene

In Cesaire's (2000 \[1972\]) Discourse on Colonialism, he suggested that
"at the very time when it most often mouths the word, [[the West has
never been further]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline} being able to live
a **[[true humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}**---a humanism made to the
measure of the world" (73). [As **the human** is being measured in the
world as **a planetary geologic agent**]{.underline}, Cesaire's question
remains pertinent to how the measure of this altering world is made, the
organization of its disciplinary formations and institutions, and the
natural philosophy through which an encounter with the future is staged.
In another searing critique of humanism, Fanon (1961) tied the
unrealized figure of a true humanism to the earth, as a wretched
counterpoint, whereby the inhuman residues of the colonial project abide
as discarded matter and the imposition of that subjective category on
the discarded. In the context of securing natural resources and the
wealth of settler societies through the colonial geoengineering of the
planet, the inhumanity of [the colonial subject forged a "**Black and
blackened**"]{.underline} (to use Sharpe's \[2018, xvi\] term)
[**subject category** in **the inhuman**]{.underline}, a designation
that materially functioned as the racialized understrata to the white
surfaces of capital accumulation. [Those **blackened colonial
afterlives**]{.underline} in "modernity's project of unfreedom" (Walcott
2014, 94) [are still very much present in the political geologies of
**climate change vulnerabilities**, the wasting effects of **racial
capitalism**, and **neo-extractivist economies**]{.underline} (Pulido
2016; Verges 2017, 2019; Sealey-Huggins 2018; Gilmore 2002).

[The **narrative arc of [humanism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Scott (2000)
suggested in conversation with Wynter,

> [is often told as a]{.underline} kind of **[European coming-of-age
> story]{.underline}**. On this account, humanism marks a certain stage
> in Europe's consciousness of itself---that stage [at which it [leaves
> behind]{.mark} it [the]{.mark}]{.underline} cramped intolerances of
> the damp and enclosed [**Middle Ages** and enters]{.underline},
> finally, [into the [**rational spaciousness** and **secular

> [that coming-of-age story has another aspect]{.underline} or dimension
> that is often relegated to a footnote, [namely the connection between

The [**Anthropocene discourse** follows **the same coming-of-age
humanist script**, searching for a **material origin story** that would
explain the newly identified trajectory of **the
Anthropos**]{.underline}; as a geologic configuration that grapples with
the excess and waste of modernity's rationalities (see Hird 2012) [and
**the material consequences** of its imposition of **reason** in the
**dividuation of the earth**]{.underline}. As Scott suggested, the birth
of humanism is also the birth of Europe's colonial project, so that
"[[**humanism** and **colonialism** inhabit the same]{.mark}
[cognitive-political Universe]{.mark}]{.underline} inasmuch as [Europe's
discovery of **its Self** is **simultaneous** with its discovery of
**its Others**]{.underline}" (Scott 2000, 120). The Fanonian paradox of
the invention of blackness has had much critical attention, yet the
substance of othering, its geophysical properties rather than
metaphysical dimensions, might also be thought to bear on the
mobilization of forces of energy and minerality in the world, as well as
the ongoing questions of environmental racism and injustice in material
exposure to environmental events and toxic body burdens (Bullard 1990;
Williams 2017, 2018; Woods 2017). That is to say that humanism has a
material gravity and an anti--black and brown ground (Moten 2003; Roane
2018).

It is well noted that **[the Anthropocene]{.underline}** as a concept is
disrupting the binaries of nature and culture, human temporality and
deep time, human history and prehistory, bio and geo, and rearranging
temporal and spatial scales of analysis, but it also [has
unproblematically reinstated a **pre-and postracial
subject**]{.underline} (Gunaratnam and Clark 2014). I want to suggest
that the inhumanities is a means to reconceptualize and challenge the
existing disciplinary approaches of the humanities that acknowledges
rather than erases the collaborative junctures between metaphysical
designations of the human and the geophysical praxis that bring
subjective forms materially into being. This geologic praxis refers both
to the extraction of natural and psychic resources for the maintenance
of white heteropatriarchy, and how materiality regulates racist
structures of extraction and subjugation. [In the Anthropocene, the
human often comes into view, organized]{.underline} as it is [around the
**telos of a coming catastrophe**]{.underline}. Although [[**the human**
is a **ritual object of self-flagellation**]{.mark} for Western
thought]{.underline} (through the Enlightenment and then its critiques
of postcolonialism, poststructuralism, and posthumanism), it nonetheless
remains a dominant figure [[that marshals]{.mark} the [horizons of
meaning]{.mark} with an **irrepressible recurrence**]{.underline}.
Because this is where meaning has been made, as postcolonial thinkers
such as Fanon, Glissant, Cesaire, and Wynter understood, it is also
where meaning gets unmade or remade, so it is both the target and site
of possible emancipation with regard to racist structures of material
engagement. Similarly, the inhuman is a site of traffic in subjective
and material forms of life, so it is also a site of possibility for
decolonizing the entanglement of race and geographic processes. As the
category of the inhuman is positioned as ahistorical, or that which is
placed outside of the time of racial capitalisms to propel its notion of
time and space, so it holds the potential for reimagining the dimensions
of time and space.

Alongside Fanon's (1961) decolonizing tract, Wretched of the Earth, the
subterranean theorizing of the black radical tradition (e.g., C. L. R.
James, Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, Tina Campt,
Tiffany Lethabo King) has shown that **[the ground]{.underline}** (and
grounding) [of [**humanism** is **antiblack**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
onto-epistemological organization of an antiblack earth matters for
antiracist struggles beyond questions of territory and environmental
justice, [because it is [an **epistemic inscription** that
**conditions**]{.mark} **structures of [thought]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
their **[institutional manifestations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Race
provided the imposition of material poverty [with a **moral
justification**]{.underline}, reallocating the burden of destitution
onto a racial determinant rather than a systematic organization of
material relations. Black and Indigenous studies have been theorizing a
nonnormative materiality for years, precisely because [**[the black and
Indigenous subject]{.mark}** is **historically irreducible** to **the
normative (humanist) subject**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [this
**antiblack** and **brownness** is]{.underline} materially and
theoretically [[made **concurrently**]{.mark} with the **inscription of
the earth** through the **grammars of geology**]{.underline} within
colonial praxis and its afterlives (Yusoff 2018c). The natality of this
emergence can be said [to constitute an **ontological inscription** of
**black**, **Indigenous**, and **earth** as the ground for **the
"natural" right of whiteness** to consolidate the planet for the
generation of value]{.underline} (also see Bonds and Inwood 2016;
Baldwin and Erickson 2020). The historic and geographical differences
across which the questions of geology and race travel are specific and
varied, and by no means exclusive, but across the plateaus of
colonialism, race provided the political redemption for the white
supremacy of matter. [The **discourse of "improvement"** brought **raced
subjects** and **indigenous land theft** into the **economic
terraforming project** of **natural resources**]{.underline}.

#### Humanism created the construction of race that placed Blackness as the antithesis of Western rational Man

Dr. Louiza **Odysseos 24**, Professor of International Relations at
University of Sussex of Brighton, UK with a PhD in International

Wynter is concerned with '**[[Man's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
overrepresentation', by which she means that a
[particularist]{.underline} construct, an 'ethnoclass (i.e. [Western
bourgeois]{.underline}) [[conception of **the human**' arising in **the
Renaissance** and]{.mark} later [undergoing]{.mark} a **Darwinian
'biocentric' [evolution]{.mark}**[, '**overrepresents itself**
as]{.mark} if it were **[the human]{.mark} itself**']{.underline}.29
[Such **[overrepresentation]{.mark}**]{.underline} is not simply a
matter of scholarly note. Rather, it
**[[safeguards]{.underline}]{.mark}** the well-being -- propternos or
'our sake'30 -- of [this [**'ethnoclass'** to]{.mark} the [detriment
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the well-being of [**the wider [human]{.mark}**
[and **other**]{.mark}**-than-human [species]{.mark}**
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} reverberating legacies of **[colonial and
[racial violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** and [**contemporary
inequalities** [and **planetary harm**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as
climate change.31

The first orientation pivots around her complex, relational view of
orders of consciousness and the construction of otherness, as well as
how orders of consciousness are co-constituted with epistemological and
material structures. Wynter does not regard otherness as pre-given or
essential identity or difference. She maps, instead, [the **relational
[construction]{.mark}** [of **otherness** through **Man**]{.mark}**'s
establishment**]{.underline}, which [[grounds **the**]{.mark}
**colonial-[modern]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Wynter traces the pre-history
of the view that [the **invention of ['race']{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
modernity-[coloniality's **'most efficient instrument of**]{.mark}
**social [domination']{.mark}** to the heretical emergence of
Renaissance humanism]{.underline}.32 She argues that the Renaissance's
'de-godding' of the human from its erstwhile religious/divine conception
affected both knowledge 'of the sociohuman world' and of the human
subject, 'one whose mode of being would be no longer guaranteed by the
"higher system" of the divinely sanctioned mythos and theolo-gos' of
Christianity. [**Establishing [Man]{.mark}** as the **central locus**
of]{.underline} Renaissance, and later Enlightenment, [humanist orders
of consciousness and knowledge]{.underline}, 'laid the foundations of
our modern rational world'. It [radically [restructured **all**]{.mark}
**material/political [pursuits]{.mark}** of European activity,
[including **settler colonisation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of Abya Yala
(the 'New World' conceived as terra nullius), [**indigenous
[genocide]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} establishment of the
encomienda system, as well as [the **[enslavement of]{.mark}, and trade
in, [Africa]{.mark}n humanity**]{.underline}.33 The relational
construction and structural positioning of the Others of Man had
wide-ranging impact, enabling 'African enslavement, Latin American
conquest, and Asian subjugation'.34 A second heretical transition to [a
**[biocentric]{.mark} conception** of **the
[human]{.mark}**]{.underline} followed Darwin's theory of evolution,
[[establishing]{.mark} the [ascendance of]{.mark} '**the Absolute of the
[Technological rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which, increasingly
directed to the purposes of its own goal-seeking rather than by human
purposes'.35

Her emphasis on the relational construction and structural positioning
of 'cultural-specific orders of consciousness' and otherness -- of a
'we' and a 'them' -- [[**exposes** how]{.underline}]{.mark} the
culturally-specific, 'local', order of consciousness grounded by [[Man,
**represents itself** as]{.mark} **supraculturally
[universal]{.mark}**]{.underline}.36 In this way, [**colonial
[modernity]{.mark}** [produces]{.mark} and signifies [its **'Others'**
through]{.mark} gradations of **['ontological
lack']{.mark}**]{.underline}.37 Therefore, the concern with Man, Man's
overrepresentation, and Man's Others reveals the colonial-modern
determination of a 'Western secular ethnocentrism' via which 'the West
became the we to the ethnos of all other peoples, who all became THE
OTHER'.38 Yet, this ethnocentrism, or culturally specific conception of
the human, is not recognised as such; rather, 'Man is conceived of as an
acultural mode of being'.39 [**Man's [Others]{.mark}** [are all those
**'non-techno**]{.mark}**-industrial agrarian
[civilizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including [[centrally]{.mark},
those of **[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline} \... [[that the
West]{.underline}]{.mark} has been able to [[see]{.mark} only [as the
**negation** and **lack** of **its**]{.mark} **own techno-[industrial
imperative']{.mark}**]{.underline}.40 **[[The
Other]{.underline}]{.mark}** is grasped relationally by Wynter and
[[**includes not only** the]{.mark} (formerly)
**[enslaved]{.mark}**]{.underline} Afro-Caribbeans of Wynter's formative
years in colonial Jamaica, [[but]{.mark} more broadly **[the
racialised]{.mark}**, **the [colonised]{.mark}**, **the indigenous**,
[and]{.mark} the new neoliberal, 'transracial', category of **the
unproductive and [jobless poor]{.mark}**]{.underline}.41 The relational
construction and positioning of otherness was intimately tied with, and
made possible through, twinned processes of
[**[objectification]{.mark}** and **racialisation**]{.underline}, as she
documents in her unpublished magnum opus, Black Metamorphosis: 'The
indigenous, the unchosen, was to be [[transformed]{.underline}]{.mark}
from [**[the human]{.mark} subject** of his **own culture** [into **the
inhuman object** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[Europe]{.mark}an
culture**' and **[Africans]{.mark}**, now denoted as
**Black**]{.underline}, 'as Sambo, the n\-\-\--r Minstrel', [[were
placed at the **nadir**]{.mark} **of 'this architecture of
defamation'**]{.underline}.42 [**Africans** come to be [**defined**
as]{.mark} the]{.underline} very **[structural [antithesis of
Man]{.mark}]{.underline}**, represented as 'the ontological lack within
the terms \... of the secularized autopoetic field of meaning of the
Judaeo-Christian West'.43

Moreover, with the ascendance of the biocentric-Darwinian 'origin
narrative', [[**Man** is]{.mark} rendered as **'bio-[evolutionary
selected']{.mark}** [while '**its "Other"**]{.mark} and "Others"
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily those categories of humans who are
projected, in terms of the same Origin narrative, as having been
**[bio-evolutionary [dysselected']{.mark}]{.underline}**.44 Coming to
denote 'the missing link between (the divinely created) rational human
species and the (equally divinely created) animal species', such
structural positioning of Man's Others as the 'non-evolved countertype'
to Man causes illimitable harm on African and African-descended
populations.45 [Imposing a **'corporeal
[malediction']{.mark}**]{.underline}46 [[renders **African**]{.mark}
**and Afro-diasporic [populations]{.mark}** -- legally, psychologically
and materially through colonialism and chattel slavery -- into **'a
different kind o' creature'**, **[neither 'man' nor
'people']{.mark}**]{.underline}.47 Acting 'as a solvent', [[it
facilitated]{.mark} the [**fungibilisation** of]{.mark} 'all
[peoples]{.mark} of African descent \... who are [**negatively marked**
as **defective**]{.mark} **humans**]{.underline} within the terms of
Man's self-conception, and its related understanding of what it is to be
human'.48 The designation and naturalisation of ontological lack was
central to the grammar and practices of colonial extraction as Kathryn
Yusoff has shown. Far from a bygone historical matter, 'the inhuman'
continues to ground 'the paradigm of extraction' in the so-called 'the
Anthropocene', such that the intense co-constitution of Man and
extraction requires critical attention to 'the conjoined material praxis
of colonial terra -- and subjectforming'.49 **[Such
['marking']{.mark}]{.underline}**, moreover, [[**persists** in
**new**]{.mark} **forms of violence**, [**incarceration** and **exposure
to death**]{.mark} **and injury** for **'black life

Political Thought Programme at York University, Fall 2024,

This contrast designates one particular impasse between the ensemble of
questions and debates animating contemporary (white) science studies and
its critical race counterpart. While Benjamin is invested in "urging a
sustained, field-wide commitment to incorporating critical race
approaches in the study of science and technology,"40 I am more
interested in noting this aporia as symptomatic of a much deeper
disciplinary fissure, one that cannot be so readily or easily
recuperated.41 [Rather than assuming that what is needed for a more
critical study of science]{.underline} and technology [is the
incorporation of Black critical theoretics into its conceptual
arsenal,]{.underline} what [I understand this fissure to be expressive
of]{.underline} is [an extant and ongoing antagonism]{.underline}, one
[that is constituted through the field's very formation.]{.underline} In
some ways, this is to tarry with the possibility that [[science studies
is a]{.mark} foundationally [white enterprise]{.mark}, a white
conspiracy.]{.underline} Not simply a question of its historic and
contemporary demographic makeup or the central analytics it is currently
preoccupied with,42 [there is, built into its assumptive logics, a
racialism that animates its enterprise.]{.underline}

The Dialogue Must (Not) Occur

I can't pretend that I haven't sometimes read many of these texts from a
similar place of awe and pleasure. But as much as I enjoy examples of
critical work happening within the field of science studies (I cannot
discount the possibility that it is, perhaps, because I enjoy them),43 I
remain suspicious concerning their political stakes and the contexts
animating their interventions---particularly of [a [material]{.mark}
basis for [politics grounded in]{.mark} knowledge generated through
[facts produced through the scientific method]{.mark}]{.underline} (and
then transposed or applied by critical humanities scholars).44 This
assumption [makes common cause with a racist, technofascist
impulse,]{.underline} rather than a democratic one as it so often
ostensibly articulates itself, [and [risks reinforcing a racial
structure of knowledge]{.mark} predicated on the self-determining
subject distanced from a radical exteriority]{.underline}.45 It is one
thing to debate the ontological transformations endemic to [the
discourse of science]{.underline} itself,46 but quite another to pose
that these transformations must then [impose on humanities
scholarship]{.underline} a concomitant transformation in [the structure
of its knowledge [and its understanding of the
human]{.mark}]{.underline}.47 In the former move, an intellectual
history of science operates on the terms of science as its explicit
given, in the latter, science's understanding of a material real is
reified by way of its importation into the humanities and the assumed
leverage it has in problematizing the pre-existing conceptual arsenal.
[This is [buttressed by an]{.mark} implicitly [Enlightenment logic
that]{.mark} the epistemological procedure of [science]{.mark}
inherently [provides]{.mark} progressively improved [knowledge]{.mark}
that is [neutral of idealist bias]{.mark}]{.underline}, an assumption
revealed by the constant turn to modern breakthroughs as the conceptual
tools inhering this positive transformative capacity.

To make the political and ethical stakes of my critique clear, by
implying that humanities scholarship must give way to innovations in
scientific theory, [(hard) science is implicitly positioned as the more
rigorous material enterprise]{.underline} of the two. [[This is
supported by a]{.mark}]{.underline} second (but not secondary) [[belief
that]{.mark}---because (hard) [science provides a superior
epistemological procedure for accessing]{.mark} [material
fact]{.mark},]{.underline} because (hard) science is, indeed, the
privileged point of methodological access to a material
real---[humanitarian scholarship should]{.underline} give way to and
[assimilate itself within (hard) science's epistemic formation. This is
a two-fold maneuver, [that]{.mark} both [reifies the notion of an
external, objective world,]{.mark} and concomitantly argues that access
to it provides the primary methodological procedure for producing a
truth claim]{.underline}.48 The outcome of this maneuver is simple: that
humanities must always cede to science epistemological priority. How are
we to understand the demand for this convergence in the
anti-intellectual context within which we currently reside? With what
politics do they interface in a context where humanities are under
attack for their insistence on the theoretical and the cultural as
necessary objects of analytic attention? [[To ask]{.mark} these
[questions is not]{.mark} to flirt with [anti-scientism]{.mark}
(although there are conscientious objections to be made concerning its
politics of expertise),]{.underline}49 nor is it to demand a defense in
toto of humanist scholarship,50 [[but instead to point to]{.mark} the
[fascist epistemologies that]{.mark} are,]{.underline} to evoke George
Jackson, [already here]{.underline},51 [the fascist epistemologies that
seek to order our worlds through a social calculus inextricable from the
promise of positivistic totality]{.underline}.52 The desire for "the
dialogue between biology and philosophy," as Malabou so aptly puts it,53
seems inextricable from the broader epistemic terms conditioning our
critiques, a context [where anti-intellectualism often [take]{.mark}s
[the form of crude defensive postures concerning the objectivity of
science]{.mark}]{.underline},54 a context where various departments are
shuttered by administrators for their lack of immediate workplace
translatability, a context where the trafficking in of scientific
research into critical modes of social and political theorizing seems
indissoluble from the disappearance of humanities scholarship writ large
that is structuring the desire for that movement in the first
instance.55

Malabou's deferred convergence, the dialogue between science and
philosophy that hasn't happened, but that, to her mind, must, is a
dialogue that is not only already happening, but also is, in fact,
repeatedly made to happen. It is the desire for this convergence, [this
repeated performance]{.underline} of ritualistic concession and the
demand made therein, that [is precisely the thing to ward against. This
is not to ask for a renewal of forms of epistemic isolationism between
the disciplines]{.underline} (did they ever really exist?), [but to ask
about the importance of politics quite literally in the strategic games
of a broader cultural war.]{.underline}

Yusoff posits that [geology is inseparable from the subjugation of Black
and Indigenous people]{.underline}. It is important to clarify that
[this analysis is not metaphorical]{.underline}; Yusoff argues that [the
practice of geology]{.underline}, and the establishment of the
discipline, [is literally foundational to the colonial state and the
project of extraction and racialization.]{.underline} She states,
"\[t\]here is not geology on one hand and stories about geology on the
other; rather, there is an axis of power and performance that meets
within these geologic objects and the narratives they tell about the
human story" (34). [The structures of power built up and enacted to
enable extraction through dispossession and the enslavement of Black
people are inextricable from our understanding of all things geologic
and the technologies built on the use of all minerals.]{.underline}
While core assumptions of other disciplines such as medicine and
anthropology have been thoroughly critiqued, including ideas around
"race, blood, racial taxonomies of eugenics, and environmental
determinism ... [geology remains stubbornly resilient in maintaining its
inhuman categories of metal, gold, mud, slave, earth,
Carib"]{.underline} (ibid: 73). This is to say, [Black and Indigenous
people within the practice of geology have been categorized as
inhuman]{.underline}, and this fact has been quietly ignored and escaped
critical investigation. Fundamentally, Yusoff's theory of inhumanities
hinges on exposing how [no geology is neutral]{.underline}, shedding
light on how [the practice of geology was organized to expose Black and
Indigenous communities to harm from its inception into the present
day.]{.underline} Throughout A Billion Black Anthropocenes or None
(2018), Yusoff uses case studies around the Atlantic slave trade and the
invasion of the Caribbean to illustrate how [geology]{.underline} is in
fact a relation of power that [continues through the present "in its
incarnation in the Anthropocene and in its material manifestation in
mining, petrochemical sites and corridors, and their toxic
legacies]{.underline}---all over a world that resolutely cuts exposure
along color lines" (ibid: 21).

This theory is demonstrated and argued predominantly through the history
of anti-Black racism and the enslavement of millions of African people.
Yusoff traces how [sites of extraction and plantations were
instrumental, geosocial, tools of the project of
colonization.]{.underline} Indeed, she says "[the racial categorization
of Blackness shares its natality with mining the New World, as does the
material impetus for colonialism]{.underline} in the first instance"
(ibid: 14). [Displaced and enslaved people were forced into mines and
sites of extraction to build colonial wealth, necessitating the creation
of Blackness as a racialized category. Chattel slavery, a form of
spatial extraction, categorized people as property, rendering subjects
as inhuman matter]{.underline} (ibid: 16), a conflation apparent in the
face that Africa's Gold Coast, a source of both gold and slaves, was
referred to as "the Mine" (Hartman in Yusoff, 2018: 20). In fact, [the
first people kidnapped and sold into slavery on the Gold Coast were
conceived of as a solution to the "'problem' of mining in Brazil: the
perceived difficulties of indigenous labor (given that 90 percent of the
population was wiped out due to violence and disease)"]{.underline}
(ibid: 24). In a time, preceding fossil fuel energy sources, slavery was
the tool of global energy distribution, destroying Black lives and
enriching colonial nations (ibid: 24). Through tracing these histories,
stories of how each spoonful of sugar represents the conversion of
energy from an enslaved person, Yusoff challenges histories of the
Anthropocene that laud white men of industry and force our attention to
the unacknowledged fact that millions upon millions of Black lives were
destroyed to build the Anthropocene (ibid: 25).

Notice how **[[Anthropocene ideas]{.underline}]{.mark}** can
[[naturalize]{.mark} **normative uses of ["humanity."]{.mark}** [In
conversations about]{.mark} **evidence for [geological
periodization]{.mark}** there is often unreflective movement between
humanity as a name for an **aggregate of biophysical forcings**
[and]{.mark} humanity as **authorizing warrant** for **[appropriate
political responses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The oscillation between
natural description and normative proposal should stimulate reflective
criticism. Indeed, by placing interpretation of humanity at the center
of understanding how planetary systems are changing, the Anthropocene
idea would seem a boon to the humanities (Palsson et al. 2013; Thomas
2022). Ethics, in particular, becomes unavoidable. As Larry Rasmussen
puts it: "if the Anthropocene is an engineered world, then it all turns
on human power and morality" (2012, 216). If one goal of religious
ethics has been to cultivate normative analysis of cultural discourse
that presents itself as neutral (for example, Townes 2006; Miller 2016),
the field should be especially helpful to deliberating over the contrary
versions of humanity in Anthropocene ideas.

[In [major science]{.mark}]{.underline} papers, however, [the
Anthropocene idea [functions more]{.mark} often [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
the opposite direction: [**[suppressing critical reflection]{.mark} on
concepts [of humanity]{.mark}** []{.mark}while **warranting extension of
their power**]{.underline}. Crutzen concluded his "Geology of Mankind"
article in Nature by calling "scientists and engineers to guide society
towards environmentally sustainable management," possibly with
"large-scale geo-engineering projects" (2002, 23). In subsequent
articles Crutzen (2006) argued for solar radiation management through
atmospheric sulfates. [**Climate engineering** and the Anthropocene
became reflexively warranting, [the idea]{.mark} in one driving a sense
of inevitability in the other. If we live in the Anthropocene, then
[humans must accept]{.mark} [responsibility for optimizing the
climate]{.mark}; if humans are engineering the climate, then we must
live in the Anthropocene]{.underline}.2 As Lisa Sideris (2017b) has
observed, [the Anthropocene idea can [make]{.mark} **collective
[terraforming]{.mark}** into [**a scientific fact**, confirmed by
**geological periodization**]{.mark}, in a way [that **extends**]{.mark}
**the enterprise of [power]{.mark}** [while **exempting it from
critique**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[In]{.mark} major [Earth]{.mark} system [science]{.mark}]{.underline}
papers of the following decade, [**"[humanity"]{.mark}** [has been
deployed]{.mark} in three different but reinforcing senses: (i) as name
for a **discovery about aggregate causation** in Earth systems, (ii) as
**subject of collective responsibility** for Earth, and (iii) [as
**normative goal** of an **imperiled cultural
project**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Read Will Steffen\'s team combine those
three uses in one text: "the human enterprise is now a fully coupled,
interacting component of the Earth System itself," which grounds the
need "for effective Earth System stewardship to maintain a global
environment within which humanity can continue to develop in a humane
and respectful fashion" (2011b, 740, 756). Evidence supporting discovery
of cumulative impact (humanity as cause) grounds a call for planetary
stewardship (humanity as moral subject), which is keyed to human
development (humanity as norm).

Work from ethics can denaturalize those combinations, opening them in
ways that drive broader cultural reflection on what "humanity" is doing.
One way to do that is by critiquing [the normative vision authorized by
Anthropocene discourse as]{.underline} contingent and perhaps repugnant
(Crist 2013). [**Controlling power over the biosphere** is **not** a
necessary **manifestation of nature**]{.underline}. Thus Heather Davis
and Zoe Todd write: "[the **[ecocidal logics]{.mark} that now govern our
world** [are **not inevitable**]{.mark} or [**'human nature,\'**
but]{.mark} . . . [have]{.mark} **their [origins]{.mark}** and
**reverberations [in colonization]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (2017, 763).
[The **current fact** of **[anthropogenic influence]{.mark} over
planetary systems** [does **not**]{.mark} **obviously [justify]{.mark}**
an **earth-engineering [managerialism]{.mark}** focused on
[extending]{.mark} a [**Eurocentric sense** of **human
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That so rudimentary an intervention
must be made illustrates Sideris\'s point about cosmogenic functions of
Anthropocene.

Another way to excavate that myth-making and denaturalize the
combinations of humanity at work in them is to describe the intellectual
genealogy from which they developed. [The [notion that]{.mark} rising
[human power reinterprets geological history goes back]{.mark} nearly
[as far as]{.mark} **the idea of [geological history]{.mark}**
itself]{.underline} (back to 280 ppm). Nineteenth century discussions
about whether and when to recognize an epoch after the Pleistocene noted
that human agriculture had reshaped the surface of Earth after the
latest glacial retreat. Nineteenth century geologists, recall Lewis and
Maslin, settled on "Holocene" for its etymological connotation of
"entirely new time," which carries the irruptive sense that something
novel had interrupted natural history. In the early twentieth century a
Russian geologist preferred to call this period the Anthropocene (Lewis
and Maslin 2015). So [the recent spate of **Anthropocene
[proposals]{.mark}** repeat and **[intensify]{.mark} intellectual
[impulses]{.mark}** that have **been [present]{.mark}** [since
**European**]{.mark} **beginnings of [geology]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
One task for ethics thus remains the same as ever: to track interactions
of moral and empirical cosmology and open them to reflective criticism.

#### Refusal of political action is a generative practice of [recovery]{.underline} and [care]{.underline} that is key to maintain Black [sociality]{.underline}.

Disengagements as Fugitive Practices of Recovery and Care

This section explores [acts of [disengagement as fugitive]{.mark}
practices of [recovery and care]{.mark}]{.underline} and asks more
broadly how we can [understand radical sociality and political practice
[not enunciated in]{.mark}]{.underline} speech or [[formal
political]{.mark} [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as how
action, communication, and symbolisation might be enacted within a more
expansive political space. While [disengaging from spaces of formal
political action]{.underline}, people turned to alternative socialities
and practices of collaboration and care that they had encountered [in
local Black communities]{.underline} and religious communities that
[[functioned as]{.mark} "loopholes of
[retreat]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Jacobs 2009:26). As people
shared during interviews, within these networks, all manner of different
tasks (from childcare to plumbing work to translation) and financial and
emotional resources were exchanged that were otherwise difficult to
access. Given that political commonality and organisation were
experienced (at least to some extent) as contaminated by the
constitutive power of empire and race, these alternative socialities may
be read as fugitive forms of commonality (Harney and Moten 2013). As
such, [retreat]{.underline} from these campaign and activist group
spaces [may be read as a practice of rest, maintenance, recovery, and
care.]{.underline} In spring 2016, when I joined John (introduced
earlier) for a walk somewhere in the north of London, he explained why
he had stopped attending the meetings and events of groups with which he
had previously been involved: You have to remember, I'm not allowed to
work. You have to remember that I live far ---now, I am speaking for
me---I have people that support me financially; most people don't. You
have to remember that I sometimes don't even have food in the house. You
have to remember that sometimes I have to take a bus instead of a train
because it is cheaper and then \... the journey that used to take me 30
minutes takes me three hours. You have to remember \... In June 2017,
Jalila, a 33-year-old woman from Cameroon, shared: Honestly, I've not
been ok. The last few weeks have been horrible. I feel there are days
where I wake up and think I need to do something for myself like going
for a walk. I can't go to attend a meeting or demonstration. It's too
much, it's the stress. Honestly it's just been so stressful. It's been a
year now. By disengaging, John and Jalila reclaim bodily and temporal
space and moments of comfort and ease (see also Meier 2020).
[[Disengagement is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus also [[a creative practice
of intentionally pausing, resting, and maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark}.
A large body of scholarship has attended to the emotional and affective
politics of borders (e.g. Ahmed 2004, 2014) and how specific affects,
such as exhaustion (Emejulu and Bassel 2020), unease (Gill 2009), and
discomfort (Meier 2020), as well as affective pressures (Lobo 2014), are
mobilised against people who are racialised and criminalised as
migrants. These emotions and pressures have the "potential to wound,
numb and immobilise bodies affecting what they can do or what they
become" (Lobo 2014:101). To survive under these intensities and
pressures and regain some level of emotional, psychological and mental
well-being requires taxing emotional labour on the part of those living
under such impossible conditions (Meier 2020). The observed [[acts of
disengagement]{.underline}]{.mark} may thus be [read as fugitive
practices of recovery and care]{.underline}---a means of forging a
healthy distance and boundaries to [[ensure]{.mark} the possibility of
rest and [survival]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the following, this section
wants to reconsider radical politics and sociality through and with the
body. While attending a detention centre protest in May 2016, Grace, a
46-year-old woman from Nigeria, recounted her experience of speaking
publicly at protest events: They want me to say political things. I
won't say what you want me to say. I cannot say what you want me to say.
I can only say how I feel right now. They want me to tell me this
political stuff, but I will tell my story, how I feel. I just want to
say my own things, and how I would say it in my own words, and trust how
I feel. Several weeks later, in a cafe in Central London, Godfrey, a
39-year-old man from Uganda who had recently received a five-year
status, shared his experiences of his time in a detention centre, where
he had been detained for three and a half months in 2013: These groups
couldn't offer me the help I needed. I helped myself, my body, my mind,
my heart \... I tried not to think about how bad things are. Others did
and I always tried to take away some of the pressures that person was
feeling by offering my company, my support. Grace's refusal made and
disordered meaning as it evaded the norms of political speech and action
and exposed how the hauntings of empire and race continued to exert
power over her body and knowledge. Godfrey, rather than relying on
organisations, groups, and political speech to help himself and to
articulate demands for recognition from a system and state, decided to
ask what he already had that he could offer to others. Harney and Moten
(2013), among others, have emphasised [[the]{.mark} existing [system's
reliance on]{.mark} correcting and improving racialised people by
[asking "what do we not have that we need]{.mark}?': "]{.underline}But
defining deficiency and addressing the state ['[privatizes]{.mark}
[reproduction' and forecloses asking, 'what do we already have]{.mark}
and do [that we must]{.mark} militantly
[preserve?]{.mark}'"]{.underline} (Shulman 2021:286, quoting Harney and
Moten 2013). Both accounts inspire us to reconsider radical sociality
and the political through and with the body as a site of
"intergenerational praxis of acting from one's conditions in order to
reorganize the field of 'truth'" (Spillers 1987, quoted in Paris 2018).

#### Legal Rights = humanist

University of Sussex of Brighton, UK with a PhD in International
Relations from London School of Economics and Political Science,

struggle and the 'undared shape'," *The International Journal of Human
Rights,* 28(8-9), pp. 1251-1278,

Regarding, first, the relational construction and structural positioning
of Man's Others, [[**rights** are **part of 'the Word of Man'**]{.mark},
historically emerging out of both republican and liberal legal /
constitutional orders in the Age of Revolutions]{.underline}, as a
result of [struggles for the new 'rights of man']{.underline}.79 Yet
human rights scholarship frequently '[forgets' that the American
Revolution was also an anti-colonial revolt; it **ignores the debt
owed** by Europeans to the **ideas** and **political practices** of
**those they colonised and enslaved** in the development of
rights]{.underline}, European constitutional orders and political
practices.80 Moreover, [it **disavows** the **philosophical and
political primacy** of the **Haitian Revolution** as the **first
anti-slavery revolution**]{.underline}.81 Viewed on the basis of
Wynter's intellectual orientations, it is important to acknowledge that
[[**rights** are a **colonial**]{.mark}**-modern [artefact]{.mark}**
[grounded on]{.mark} the **[hegemonic understanding of the
human]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As decolonial scholars have argued,
colonialism was 'the primary ground of the most widespread
understandings of humanity in the modern/colonial world'.82 [Not only do
rights]{.underline} 'historically [incorporate an **autonomous [legal
subject]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a possessive claim to rights',83
[**the rights subject** [is **predicated on** Man's]{.mark} **ostensibly
[universal]{.mark}, acultural, [conception of the
human]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite ceaseless struggles to contest and
reimagine both rights and their subject.84

[Man's acultural conception institutes 'actions/behaviours prescribed
and legitimated by a universally applicable "understanding of man's
humanity" and its mode of truth']{.underline}, a mode whose 'culture
systemic categories' are not recognised as particularist; they are
premised, instead, on the pervasive idea that Western-bourgeois culture
is not 'a culture at all, and that our native model of reality (Legesse
1973, p. 274) is reality-in- itself'.85
**[[Rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** belong to 'ethno-class conceptions' of
colonial-modern discursive and signifying formations; they also [**tend
to [occlude]{.mark}** their **'always [culturally specific']{.mark}
clusters of [meanings]{.mark}** and codes, upholding themselves as
universal]{.underline} 'as if these formations were ecumenically human
conceptions'.86 [[**Sustaining** Man's **acultural overrepresentation**
as **rational** and **universal**]{.mark} **figure**, they help [render
**Man's Others** as]{.mark} **'intellectually
probationary'**]{.underline},87 [**being [structurally
positioned]{.mark}** [as **Man's**]{.mark} **irrational, animalistic,
[antithesis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.88 Although contested and reforged
'in their exercise' in subaltern struggles,89 Wynter's analyses, I have
shown here, help illuminate how rights, as 'ethno-class conceptions',
secure Man's 'biocosmogonically chartering origin narrative', which is
central to the semiotic and epistemic orders that legetimate colonial
modernity's material structures.90

Second, beyond their legal-political significance, [rights]{.underline}
as part of Man's origin narrative are implicated in autopoetic
constitution, mattering 'sociogenically' because their
'genre'/culturally specific terms contribute to the symbolic codes of
life and death, selection and dysselection, 'us/not us' constructions of
otherness.91 As such, they [have a **dislocating effect** for **[Man's
Others]{.mark}**, who]{.underline} no 'longer coincide with' and [[have
to]{.mark} ~~'circumcise'~~\[**[cut off]{.mark}** a [**part** of\]
themselves]{.mark} **'in order [to be fully
human']{.mark}**]{.underline} in the descriptive statement of Man.92
**[[Rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**, moreover, [[are]{.mark} amongst
**[modernity's 'terms of salvation']{.mark}**]{.underline}93 [through
which those **dysselected humans** imagine navigating their way out of
their brutal positioning]{.underline} in 'backward- ness', animality and
unreason -- 'what other model was there?', asks Wynter.94 Yet origin
stories should not misleadingly denote rights as bygone legacies of [the
erstwhile **['rights of man']{.mark}**]{.underline}. For Wynter, a
'transumed abductive-conception of "human rights"', [continues to
[ground **wider**]{.mark} **colonial-modern [social
structures]{.mark}**]{.underline} that 'are not simply historical but
continue [into **the present**']{.underline}.95

CDR: Temporal Location

Thompson Dorsey and Venzant Chambers (2014) argued that [an **ongoing
[cycle of inequality]{.mark}**]{.underline} exists that [[moves
**through stages** of]{.underline}]{.mark} CDR. Calling forth Bell's
(1980) concept of interest convergence, convergence periods include the
["**[temporary alignment]{.mark}** of the **self interest of elite
whites** and the **interests of Blacks**"]{.underline} (Thompson Dorsey
& Venzant Chambers, 2014, p. 82). [[After **periods of convergence**,
**divergence periods**]{.mark} are marked by the]{.underline} interests
between Whites and racially minoritized communities diverging, leading
to the [**[pull]{.mark}ing [back]{.mark}**, **weakening**, or
**challenging of [any progress]{.mark}** [seen in]{.mark} the
**[convergence]{.mark} period**]{.underline}. Finally, **[[imperialistic
reclamation]{.underline}]{.mark}** is based on Harris's (1993) concept
of Whiteness as property, which [**[explicates]{.mark}** "the
**[reification]{.mark}**, in law, of **expectations [of white
privilege]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (p. 1784). [In **imperialistic
reclamation periods**, [Whites "**aggressively reclai\[m\]"** perceived
losses of]{.mark} **White [privileges]{.mark}** [utilizing]{.mark} **the
law** and]{.underline}, as we argue, [other **mechanisms of [plantation
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Thompson Dorsey & Venzant Chambers,
2014, p. 72). Arguably, each of [these periods cycle temporally and at
times overlap depending on the U.S. presidency]{.underline} (Vigil &
Muñoz, 2023); societal, global, racial, and ethnic climate [crises; and
policy changes, [such as the **recent**]{.mark} **U.S. Supreme Court's
[decision]{.mark}** [on **Affirmative Action**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Sherman, 2023). For example, via Affirmative Action, Thompson Dorsey
and Venzant Chambers (2014) approximately identified the 1960s as a
period of interest convergence; the mid- to late 1970s to the early
2000s as a period of interest divergence; and starting in 2003, a period
of imperialistic reclamation, demonstrating their conceptualization of
temporality in the CDR model.

### AT: Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism requires the intensification authoritarianism, militarized policing, mass surveillance, and suppression of dissent

Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge with a PhD in
Politics from the University of Manchester, UK, 7/2024, \"The 'wicked
trinity' of late capitalism: Governing in an era of stagnation, surplus
humanity, and environmental breakdown.\" *Geoforum*, 153,
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2023.103691, DJDubb

[Liberal governance has two faces. Its political face]{.underline} is
associated with processes of civic enfranchisement, representation,
participation, [and]{.underline} equal rights for all (Landa, 2010).
[Its economic face]{.underline} is concerned with [the enforcing of a
neat separation between the economic and the political]{.underline}, and
the consolidation of a rules-based order to ensure the functioning of
'free' markets (Plant, 2010). Our argument is that the 'wicked trinity'
[places growing strains]{.underline} on both aspects of [the state's
liberal character. This is evident in **states' contradictory attempts**
to **manage**]{.underline} the **[crises]{.underline}** at each pole of
the trinity and their interrelations.

[Take, for instance, the **[increasingly]{.mark} coercive forms of
rule** and **repressive technologies of labour containment**
developed]{.underline} by states in both the Global North and Global
South [to address]{.underline} the multiplication of [surplus
populations. **Disciplining** and **[governing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the latter [has [involved]{.mark} **pronounced [authoritarian
tendencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from **[[aggressive]{.mark} border
[militarization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the development of AI-powered
systems of [**[mass surveillance]{.mark}**, the [**criminalization**
and]{.mark} **brutal [repression of]{.mark} social [movements]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} various forms of
**[[dissent]{.underline}]{.mark}** (from the Gilets Jaunes insurrection
to the climate movement), [to the **suspension of**]{.underline} the
rule of law and **[civil liberties]{.underline}** (Bruff and Tansel
2020). Increasingly exclusionary notions of national identity and
citizenship have been used to cultivate support from insiders and divide
populations.

To be sure, [within the liberal order]{.underline}, the promise of
[**political [emancipation]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} **always [been
reserved]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} a **relatively [circumscribed
'community]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the free', [while **[those
excluded]{.mark}**]{.underline} from it -- slaves, colonized
populations, women, and paupers -- [[have been **subject** to]{.mark}
**intense [state control]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Losurdo, 2011). Yet, in
a context of dwindling labour market opportunities and environmental
destruction, [**liberal [governance]{.mark}** increasingly **[relies
on]{.mark} the [exclusion]{.mark}** of]{.underline} more and **[more
people]{.underline}** from the community of the free. [[**Surplus
humanity** becomes]{.mark} a [matter of **policing**, **surveillance**
and **incarceration**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gilmore, 2007, Clover, 2019;
(Wacquant, 2010). Nowhere is this more visible than in the choice of the
world's richest countries to spend more annually on securitizing their
borders than on mitigating climate change (Transnational Institute,
2021). Consider also the various deals that the EU has made with Turkey,
Libya, and Morocco to outsource authoritarian 'migration management,' or
the UK's policy to send asylum seekers to Rwanda (euphemistically known
as the Migration and Economic Development Partnership). [Liberal
capitalist states' responses to]{.underline} the multiplication of
[surplus populations]{.underline} thus [appear in the **(illiberal)
form** of]{.underline} a proliferation of [**[police]{.mark} forces**,
**[border]{.mark} wall[s]{.mark}**[, and **restricted**]{.mark} **-- if
not denied -- civil and political [rights]{.mark}**, to
**[secure]{.mark} the [interests]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **rapidly
[thinning community]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the free.

We witness not only the progressive disfiguration of liberal
governance's political face, but also the hollowing out of its economic
core as policy-makers find themselves pressed to violate the principles
of liberal economic policy. Of course, the recourse to emergency [policy
measures that temporarily suspend or bypass the logic of market
mechanisms is **not a novel feature** of liberal
governance]{.underline}. What Best (2017) calls [[**'liberal
exceptionalism'** is]{.underline}]{.mark} in fact [a
**[recurring]{.mark} policy [reflex]{.mark}** that **capitalist
[states]{.mark}** [embrace]{.mark} to **manage social tensions** in
times of crisis, ultimately [to **preserve the**]{.mark} **liberal
[order]{.mark}** itself]{.underline} (Mann, 2017, Šumonja, 2021). Yet,
in the context of late capitalism's wicked trinity, there is a change in
the scale, intensity, and frequency with which governments have recourse
to such measures. Put simply, in late capitalism, the line between
'normal' periods of liberal governance and exceptional periods of
emergency politics becomes increasingly blurred.

Compelled to navigate this contradiction, [[**liberal state governance**

putting out immediate fires than forging durable patterns of economic

At the same time, [the project to **constitutionalize living in the
Anthropocene** endeavours [to **establish**]{.mark} **responsive [legal
frameworks]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} **might [govern
catastrophes]{.mark}**. This]{.underline} article suggests that the
proposal of constitutionalizing in the Anthropocene [[is]{.mark}
grounded in **[a paradox]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The paradox arises
[[because]{.mark} the project **critiques extant legal frameworks**,
while **[reducing]{.mark} the challenge** of [the Anthropocene
to]{.mark} **narrow [questions]{.mark}** [of **technical**]{.mark} and
**organizational [reordering]{.mark}**. In such a framing, [**the human
remains** the]{.mark} **knowing** and [**governing subject of law**, and
**the world remains**]{.mark} the **[object to be]{.mark} known and
[governed]{.mark}**[, which]{.mark}]{.underline} undermines the core
insights of the Anthropocene concept. This article argues that the
paradox of constitutionalizing in the Anthropocene [**[risks]{.mark} the
[foreclosure]{.mark}** [of **alt**]{.mark}**ernative
[possibilities]{.mark}** in the face of crisis]{.underline}. In
contrast, the concept of 'Black Anthropocene' articulates a critical
challenge to this programmatic drive to save the modern world and its
subject, the human, through new forms of governmentality.

Ecology: Wangechi Mutu, Octavia Butler and Black Feminist Interventions
in Environmentalism," *Critical Ethnic Studies*, Vol 2:1, pg. 42-46,
modified for ableist language

Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower and Wangechi Mutu's A Fantastic
Journey, read through the lens of "[**[diaspora]{.mark}** as
anaformative impulse]{.underline}," [[perform the]{.underline}]{.mark}
aesthetic [[work of "**deconstructing colonial sites** and narratives
and rearticulating them in ways that delink geography and
power."]{.underline}]{.mark} Additionally, in the
**[[worlds]{.underline}]{.mark}** Butler and Mutu create, their
protagonists [[are]{.mark} [**illegible** within the confines of]{.mark}
anything resembling [a **nation-state.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Thusly,
the [[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}---often explicitly stated by
Butler's characters or embedded within Mutu's visual fields---[[are
irreducible to the language of citizenship]{.mark}, cultural
[particularity, and]{.mark} national [governance]{.mark}]{.underline} as
we currently conceive of it. Butler's Parable of the Sower and Mutu's A
Fantastic Journey both bespeak "the denial and desiring" of their
respective homelands (in ways that are legible and reducible to the
language of citizenship, cultural particularity, and national
governance) but often do so to signal the necessary transformation of
these geographies. Through narrative and visual culture, Butler and Mutu
[delink geography and power and put all space into play in order to keep
critical attention on black female subjectivity and resistive notions of
ecological relationality.]{.underline}

Delinking geography and power is a significant step toward reconfiguring
our earth ethics, particularly as [[environmental studies frameworks
have]{.underline}]{.mark} traditionally [[been informed by **colonial
European notions** **of** **"the political."**]{.underline}]{.mark}8
More specifically, I mean that [[environmental studies and activism
has]{.mark} traditionally [been aligned with mainstream political
discourse in its **emphasis on liberal reform** as an ideal
strategy]{.mark} for addressing its concerns.]{.underline} Sylvia
[Wynter reveals a key flaw in this]{.underline} line of
[reasoning.]{.underline} In her essay "Unsettling Coloniality," Wynter
opens by asserting

\[My\] argument proposes that [[the struggle of our]{.underline}]{.mark}
new [[millennium will be]{.mark} one [between]{.mark} the ongoing
imperative of securing the well-being of]{.underline} our present
ethnoclass (i.e., [[Western]{.mark} bourgeois]{.underline})
[[conceptions of]{.mark} the human, [Man]{.mark}, which overrepresents
itself as if it were the human itself, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} that of
securing the well-being, and therefore the full cognitive and behavioral
autonomy, of [[the human species]{.mark} itself/ourselves.]{.underline}9

Wynter argues that [[Western philosophy has constructed and
**continually reinforced** the idea of **Western Man** as the **measure
of humanity**.]{.underline}]{.mark} She also emphasizes that [[the
securing of Western Man as an ethnoclass is]{.mark} fundamentally [at
odds with]{.mark} the [securing]{.mark} of "[the human species]{.mark}
itself/ourselves."]{.underline} Elsewhere, Wynter has argued that

[our present master discipline]{.underline} of economics discursively
[functions as a secular priesthood of the U.S.
nation-state]{.underline}'s economic system. [As well as]{.underline},
therefore, [of the]{.underline} overall globally incorporated
[world-systemic capitalist economic order in its now neoliberal and
neo-imperial, homo-oeconomicus bourgeois ruling-class configuration at a
world-systemic level---of which the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is]{.underline} still its
[superpower]{.underline} hegemon.10

Here, Wynter explains that [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and its role as global superpower
[[facilitates]{.mark} the [existence of a "world systemic capitalist
economic order" based on neoliberal and neoimperial ethics.
These]{.mark} ethics [are rooted in and inextricably linked
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the notion of [[Western Man as human.
The]{.underline}]{.mark} kind of [[environmental studies]{.mark} or
activism [that **tethers itself** to a]{.mark}]{.underline} neoliberal,
neoimperial [[ethics that **sustains** our **present "world systemic
capitalist economic order"** can **never**]{.underline}]{.mark}
~~retard~~ or [[alleviate]{.mark} our [struggles]{.mark} rooted in
environmental degradation.]{.underline} If anything, [[by uncritically
**relying** on **traditional approaches** to environmental
rehabilitation and conservation via **legislative
reform**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, many
[[environmentalist]{.underline}]{.mark} activists and [[scholars
**reinforce the very system** they claim to be
fighting]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wynter outlines this conflict quite
clearly as she argues:

The correlated hypothesis here is that [**[all]{.mark}** our [**present
struggles** with respect to race, class, gender, sexual orientation,
ethnicity, struggles over the **environment, global warming**]{.mark},
severe **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the sharply [unequal
distribution of]{.underline} the earth's [resources]{.underline} (20
percent of the world's peoples own 80 percent of its resources, consume
two-thirds of its food, and are responsible for 75 percent of its
[[ongoing pollution]{.mark}, with]{.underline} this leading to [two
billion of earth's peoples living relatively affluent lives while four
billion still on the edge of hunger and immiseration]{.underline}, to
the dynamic of [overconsumption on the part of the rich
techno-industrial North]{.underline} paralleled by that overpopulation
on the part of the dispossessed poor, still partly agrarian worlds of
the South)---these [[are all **differing facets** of the **central
ethnoclass Man vs. Human struggle.**]{.underline}]{.mark}11

Following Wynter, I insist [that ["the West" itself---its **divisions of
space** and its **rigid notions** of the **human subject**---are
**insufficient frameworks** through which]{.mark} "**[global
warming]{.mark}**, severe climate change, and the sharply unequal
distribution of the earth's resources" [can be effectively addressed. We
must]{.mark}]{.underline} consider these issues while concurrently
**[[address]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [[a central conflict from which
these issues emerge: a **fraught**]{.underline}]{.mark} and delimited
**[[understanding of human subjectivity.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In her effort to connect environmental struggles with a delimited
understanding of human subjectivity, Jane [Bennett questions
the]{.underline} very [necessity of an "environmentalist" stance
entirely.]{.underline} In her book [Vibrant Matter]{.underline}: A
Political Ecology of Things, Bennett [ponders "whether environmentalism
remains the best way to frame the problems, whether it is the most
persuasive rubric for challenging the American equation of prosperity
with wanton consumption, or for inducing]{.underline} more generally,
[the political will to create more sustainable political
economies]{.underline} in or [adjacent to global
capitalism."]{.underline}12 Bennett's questions about the persuasiveness
of environmentalism, coupled with Wynter's critiques, implore me to
consider Bennett's alternative for framing these problems: vital
materialism. According to Bennett, [[traditional environmental ethics
are reliant on an **abstraction of human bodies** from their **"passive
environments"** and leave little room for "animals, vegetables, or
minerals" to be considered]{.underline}]{.mark} fully [acknowledged
[political subjects.]{.mark}]{.underline} Furthermore, according to
Bennett, [a vital materialist stance]{.underline} is more useful than an
environmental one because it (1) [makes human and nonhuman relationality
horizontal as opposed to]{.underline} vertical/[hierarchical,
and]{.underline} (2) [insists on the vitality]{.underline} or aliveness
[of all matter---drawing out the ways in which humanity]{.underline} in
its bacterial and mineral makeup [is not as distinct]{.underline} from
"everything else" [as we would like to believe.]{.underline} Bennett's
vital materialism not only includes a far more nuanced understanding of
our relationships to other forms of materiality but also aims at drawing
out horizontalized connections to others---human and nonhuman. [[Given
the history of **racialized exclusion** in mainstream environmental
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}, a horizontalized [[vital materialism
seems to speak]{.mark} back [to]{.mark}]{.underline} those [[**inherent
hierarchies** that]{.underline}]{.mark} not only abstract human bodies
from their "passive environments" but also [[agitate]{.mark} [political
structures]{.mark} and hierarchies ["that have served repeatedly to
**relegate black subjects** to the status of **western modernity's
nonhuman other.**"]{.mark}]{.underline}13

While Bennett's interventions are incredibly useful, at second glance,
her proposition does have problems that she herself anticipates. There
are dangers in an approach that seeks to lessen the distinctness between
"humanity" and "the rest of matter." Despite her attempt to democratize
all forms of materiality, Bennett's vital materialist stance retains the
potential of opening the floodgates for even more ruthless forms of
instrumentalizing human beings. Bennett tries to address these dangers,
emphasizing the idea that "if matter itself is lively, then not only is
the difference between subjects and objects minimized, but the status of
the shared materiality of all things is elevated."14 Additionally,
Bennett aims to demonstrate that [vital materialism relies on an
understanding that]{.underline} "[[all bodies become more than mere
object]{.underline},]{.mark} as the thing-powers of resistance and
protean agency are brought into sharper relief."15 [[Given the
**extensive colonial and Middle Passage histories** of the **violent
instrumentalization** of black subjects]{.mark} who have struggled for
centuries to be recognized as "human," a]{.underline} restructuring of
[[ecological ethics that retains the]{.mark} readied **[potential
for]{.mark}** further [**objectification** is]{.mark}]{.underline}
worrying at best and **[[preposterous]{.underline}]{.mark}** at worst.
At the same time, given the messy (non) distinctions between so many
different forms of materiality that Bennett highlights, it becomes
difficult to completely dismiss her logic.

Both Wynter and Bennett signal that [[a "**new" environmental politics**
**can not come** as a result of **liberal reform** or black inclusivity
within extant mainstream political discourse but only after
**understandings** of **relational human subjectivity**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} deeply [[**scrutinized** and
**restructured.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Moreover, because of the roots of
all the "isms" that Wynter coherently reports for us, [[a truly "new"
environmental politics would render our **present world
unrecognizable.**]{.underline}]{.mark} This article is concerned with
the work of imagining this other world and other relationalities between
material forms. In the pages that follow, I examine the ways Octavia
[Butler and]{.underline} Wangechi [Mutu effectively trouble
ecology]{.underline} as they lead us away [from the limitations of
traditional environmental studies while offering transgressive visions
that center black female subjectivity, challenge]{.underline} the
[(dis)connections between human and nonhuman entities, and initiate
alternative]{.underline} notions of environmental/[ecological
ethics.]{.underline}

#### This is a key [sequencing question]{.underline}\-\--reliance on the system makes effective climate solutions impossible absent a [radical]{.underline} and [prior]{.underline} disavowal of imperial knowledge paradigms and liberal subjecthood.

KM: [The [**enactment** of]{.mark}]{.underline} our present biocentric
descriptive statement (and thus its [eugenic and dysgenic sociogenic
[codes of]{.mark} symbolic [**life** and **death**]{.mark}]{.underline})
[[is linked to]{.mark} the law-like [**normalization** of]{.mark} the
corporeal features of [Western]{.mark} Europeans in their]{.underline}
now [ethno-class bourgeois [aesthetic
configuration]{.mark}]{.underline}. This normalization is most
strikingly evident in the consumer marketing of skinbleaching creams and
cosmetic surgery, as well as by the proposed mainline genetic
engineering of designer babies. Such techniques and procedures
prescriptively imply that all humans, globally, be corporeally and
aesthetically homogenized according to a single genre- specific (ethno-
class) Western European model.23 This model, of course, must be
understood against and with the range of our incomplete postcolonial,
postapartheid, post- 1960s "politics of identity / identity politics"
emancipatory struggles and, therefore, the now incomplete (and
paradoxical reversal of the) "beautification" in bourgeois- consumer
terms of, most markedly, blackness. The [failure and]{.underline}
eventual [[**co-optation** of]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[**[struggles]{.mark}** are not, as we know, limited to the corporeal.
They [reflect]{.mark}]{.underline}, instead, [the emergence of a global
free-market driven and consumer-oriented **[mimetic
desire]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is [[anchored to
a]{.underline}]{.mark} single genre- specific [[Western European
**bourgeois model** of **being**]{.mark} that is]{.underline}, itself,
[projected onto, and incorporates, all those who belong to
the]{.underline} now [globally economically Westernized middle
classes]{.underline}; their working classes; and their criminalized and
jobless underclasses. This then reifies an ostensibly humanly normative
social category: homo economicus (the virtuous breadwinner, the stable
job holder, the taxpayer, the savvy investor, the master of natural
scarcity).24 [[This]{.mark} figure]{.underline} also
[[unveils]{.underline}]{.mark}, Wynter explains, [the symbolic death of
the denizens of the "planet of slums" just as it uncovers [the
teleological underpinnings of]{.mark} the story-lie of ostensibly [human
development,]{.mark} as well as [the **reality** of **climate
change**]{.mark}]{.underline} / instability, to which, inter alia, it
gives rise.25

SW: There are two contemporary issues that make this project urgent for
me. One of them is a small- scale issue, although its implications are
not. The Jamaican health minister---I think it was in February
\[2007\]---announced that they were putting a ban on the sale of skin-
whitening cream by unlicensed vendors because they were selling cheaper
versions, which were harmful.26 It turned out that all across the
country, men and women are using these skin- whitening creams. At the
same time, in several newspaper articles, you see that the same thing is
going on in Asia. And you find that many of these women's faces are now
blotched, especially the poorer women. And Olay, for example, is turning
out products like White Radiance. In the United States, a \$15
billion-a-year plastic surgery industry flourishes. Its clients include
everybody---whites themselves but, of course, many many blacks and many
nonwhites, too: those who don't look sufficiently like the Western
bourgeoisie's projected Grecian norm of being and of beauty. Think of
the systemically induced self-aversive plastic-surgical mutilation
tragedy of the brilliantly gifted Michael Jackson! James Watson, one of
the two techno-scientists whose feat was to crack the dna code,
un-derscores a second, correlated but even more extreme issue,
specifically, the dangerous ethical implications of his proposal that
techno- scientists mainline- genetically engineer designer babies
because he said he doesn't like ugly people and he doesn't like stupid
people.27 Ugly and stupid, that is, from his own genre-specific
perspective as a Western bourgeois subject who is, however, at the same
time, when in his lab, a natural scientist.28 Okay. So this is what I
mean by the [biocentric Scholasticism]{.underline} or the bio-
Scholasticism, of our present episteme. This [is an episteme that
functions, with respect to the knowledge of our contemporary world and
its systemic reality, according to the same cognitively closed
descriptive statement and its sociogenically encoded truth of solidarity
as that of]{.underline} the theo-Scholastic knowledge system of the
medieval order of [Latin- Christian Europe.]{.underline} So this is what
gives me the urgency, do you see what I mean? For [[we **cannot allow
ourselves** to continue **thinking** in this **way**. This way of
thinking is linked to the **same ethno-class mode**]{.mark} of
behavior---regulatory and cognitively closed order of knowledge [that
has led to]{.mark} our now major collectively human predicament: the
[ongoing]{.mark} process of **[global warming]{.mark}**]{.underline},
climate instability, [[and]{.mark} [**ecosystemic
catastrophe**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Regarding the above, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} 2007
[[report]{.underline}]{.mark} in Time magazine [on global warming [tells
us]{.mark}]{.underline} two things: first, that global [[warming is a
**result** of **human activities**]{.underline}]{.mark}; and, second,
that this problem began in about 1750 but accelerated from about 1950
onward.29 Now, the date 1750 points to the Industrial Revolution. But
the article, which builds on the expertise of a U.N. climate panel,
fails to explain why global warming accelerated in 1950. What happened
by 1950? What began to happen? The majority of the world's peoples who
had been colonial subjects of a then overtly imperial West had now
become politically independent. At that time, we who, after our
respective anticolonial uprisings, were almost all now subjects of
postcolonial nations, nevertheless fell into the mimetic trap of what
Jean Price- Mars calls, in the earlier nineteenth- century case of
Haiti, "collective Bovaryism"30---because [[the West
is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[going to **reincorporate us
neocolonially**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and thereby mimetically, [[by
telling us]{.mark} that [the problem]{.mark}]{.underline} with us
[[wasn't that we'd been]{.mark} imperially subordinated]{.underline},
wasn't that we'd been both socioculturally [[dominated]{.mark}
and]{.underline} economically [exploited, [but that we were
**underdeveloped**.]{.mark}]{.underline} 31 [The West said:]{.underline}
"Oh, well, [no longer be a native but come and be Man like
us!]{.underline} Become homo oeconomicus!" While the only way we could,
they further told us, become un-underdeveloped, was by following the
plans of both their and our economists. The catch was that our
economists, like the distinguished Caribbean economist Sir Arthur Lewis,
had been educated in British im-perial universities, like many of us.
This is the same kind of model as in the Roman Empire: all the elites of
the imperially subordinated populations were educated in Roman imperial
schools! And so these [[**mimetically** **educated**
**elites**]{.underline}]{.mark}, proud to be incorporated as Roman
citizens, had [[helped to keep]{.mark} the]{.underline} Roman
[[**Empire** going]{.underline}]{.mark}; and then when the Roman Empire
was going to break down, among such elites you had a scholar like
Augustine, who before his conversion to Christianity had been a
professor of rhetoric and of the imperial Roman theory of high and low
styles. After his conversion he had then taken all of that knowledge,
then shifted the above rhetorical strategies to reinforce the
revolutionary sermo humilis of the then new "gaze from below,"
postpagan, postclassical monotheistic religion of Christianity---this
latter as one whose projected promise of eternal salvation in the City
of God will far outstrip the glories of the cities of Man, including
that of Rome itself. This is what I call an Augustinian turn, the taking
and revising of an existing system of knowledge, in order to create that
which is imperatively emancipatorily new.32

There is one profound difference here, however. Rome's empire was Roman.
Instead, as studies of contemporary neocolonialism as well as of its
predecessors colonialism and postcolonialism reveal, [[the West]{.mark},
over the last five hundred years, [has brought the whole human species
into its hegemonic]{.mark}, now purely secular]{.underline} (post-
monotheistic, post- civic monohumanist, therefore, itself also
transumptively liberal monohumanist) [[model]{.mark} of being
human.]{.underline} This is the version in whose terms [the human has
now been]{.underline} redefined, since the nineteenth century, [on the
natural scientific model of a natural organism.]{.underline} This is a
model that supposedly preexists---rather than coexists with---all the
models of other human societies and their religions / cultures. That is,
all human societies have their ostensibly natural scientific organic
basis, with their religions / cultures being merely superstructural.
[[All]{.mark} the [peoples of the world]{.mark}]{.underline}, whatever
their religions / cultures, [[are drawn into the homogenizing global
structures]{.mark} that are [based on]{.mark} the model of a natural
organism world-systemic order.]{.underline} This is the enacting of
[[a]{.mark} uniquely secular liberal [monohumanist conception of]{.mark}
the [human]{.mark}]{.underline}---Man- as- homo oeconomicus---as well as
of its rhetorical overrepresenting of that member- class conception of
being human (as if it is the class of classes of being human itself).
Guess what happens? Its empirical results, for both good and ill, have
been no less large- scale. Yet at the same time, no less genre-
specifically caused! So that's the terrifying thing with
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Time [[report]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
[[thinks the causes of]{.mark} global [warming are **human activities**,
but they are **not**!]{.mark}]{.underline} The [[**Masai**
who]{.underline}]{.mark} were (and [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[being
displaced have **nothing to do** with global warming! It's]{.mark} all
of us--- [the **Western**]{.mark} and mimetically
Westernized]{.underline} middle [[classes---after we fell into the
**trap** of **modeling ourselves** on]{.underline}]{.mark} the mimetic
model of the Western bourgeoisie's [liberal **[monohumanist
Man]{.mark}**]{.underline}2. But mind you, at the time---just prior to,
during, and after the anticolonial and civil rights struggles---what
other model was there?33 Except, of course, for the hitherto
neocolonially neglected yet uniquely ecumenically human model put
forward by Frantz Fanon from what had been his activist "gaze from
below" antibourgeois, anticolonial, anti- imperial perspective. A
uniquely ecumenically Fanonian human model that could (and can) in no
way law- likely exist within the vrai of our present epistemological
order. The vrai of, that is, in Richard Rorty's terms, its "truth of
solidarity" rather than that of, ostensibly, objectivity.34

Yet [[it is precisely within]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**law-like
epistemic terms** of the]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[globally
homogenized]{.underline}]{.mark} descriptive statement [model of being
human specific]{.underline} to the above order
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
panel's report and [[**recommendations** are **generated**; these terms
are]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[transmitted]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
postcolonially, [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} each ex- colony's branch plant
university variant of [[the West's]{.underline}]{.mark} overall [liberal
[monohumanist **academic** **system**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Consequently, the report's [[recommendations must be put forward in the
terms set by the master discipline]{.mark} of economics and its
disciplinary "truth of solidarity."]{.underline} This means that the
genre- specific preprescribed "truth" of economics must itself
analogically elaborate an ethno- class descriptive statement mode of
material provisioning that can, law- likely, be only that of homo
oeconomicus's single absolute model of free- market capitalism.
[This]{.underline} model's imperative supraordinate [[**telos**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing [capital
**[accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline} thereby [[predefines it as the
**only means**]{.mark} of production indispensable to]{.underline} the
enacting of the economic system of [free-trade market]{.underline}
capitalism's unceasing [[processes]{.mark} of
techno-industrial]{.underline} economic [growth. This]{.underline} model
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the same time, [[be enacted only
on]{.mark} the homogenized]{.underline} basis of the [[**systemic
repression** of]{.mark} all other **[alternative modes]{.mark}** of
material provisioning. [In this mode]{.mark}]{.underline} of material
provisioning, therefore, [[there can]{.underline}]{.mark} ostensibly
[[be **no alternative**]{.mark} to its attendant planetarily-
ecologically extended]{.underline}, increasingly techno- automated,
thereby job- destroying, postindustrial, yet no less fossil
fuel--driven, thereby [climate-destabilizing free-market capitalist
economic system, in its]{.underline} now [extreme neoliberal
transnational technocratic configuration. The
**[exceptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} those [[**clusters** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
still extant **[[nomadic]{.underline}]{.mark}** or sedentary
**[[indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark}** traditionally stateless
**[[societies]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for example, those of the Masai,
the San, or the Pygmy in Africa, as well as the range of other such
societies in Australia, the Americas, and elsewhere. Many of these
groups are now [[being **pushed out**]{.mark} of their ostensibly
"underdeveloped" "places" totally.]{.underline}35

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} larger [[issue is]{.underline}]{.mark}, then,
[the [**incorporation** of all **forms of human** **being** into]{.mark}
a single homogenized descriptive statement that is based on]{.underline}
the figure of the West's [liberal **[monohumanist
Man.]{.mark}**]{.underline} And this conception of being, because
ostensibly natural- scientific, is biocentric. So when Fanon says, "I
take my narcissism in both hands and I say that the human is not a mere
\[biological\] mechanism," he overturns this biocentric conception.36
That doesn't mean that this ethno-class natural organism model of the
human doesn't bring you knowledge---as Heidegger points out, it brings
you all kinds of knowledge.37 But it is not the knowledge of the human
reconceptualized in the direction of a hybridly, both mythoi and bios,
being. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore now [[need to
initiate]{.mark} the exploration of the new [**reconceptualized form**
of **knowledge**]{.mark} that would be [called]{.mark} for
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} Fanon's [[**redefinition** of being
human]{.underline}]{.mark} as that of skins (phylogeny / ontogeny) and
masks (sociogeny). Therefore bios and mythoi. And notice! [One major
implication here: humanness is no longer a noun. Being human is a
praxis.]{.underline}38

Geologies of Race

[While it might seem counterintuitive to look at the inhuman as a space
for **freedom practices**, it is the]{.underline} stratal [poetry
and]{.underline} actual [survival in this zone]{.underline} designated
as inhuman [that signal its **seismic possibilities**]{.underline}.
Engaging the depths for Césaire is a way to both shake the alienation of
stratal pressure and surface the alluviums of history (a methodology of
desedimentation without the promise of mythic recreation). [**[Epistemic
work]{.mark}** on the]{.underline} level of the [**inhuman** is a way to
[**break** apart]{.mark} the chains of [**signification** and **material
disfigurement**]{.mark} of a blood-soaked ground, renaming that relation
with the world differently.]{.underline} Blocks in [the **epistemes of
[geologics]{.mark} are [no less material]{.mark}**]{.underline} in their
outcomes [[than]{.mark} blocks in [pipelines]{.mark}. **Antidisciplinary
pedagogy** requires disciplinary analysis. **[Epistemic
interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline} can [**[restructure
devaluation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Existence in the category of the
inhuman, imagined through the intimacies of geologic kinship without
recourse to the claims of Being (or the lure of redeemability in the
category of the Human), has conditioned the very basis and possibility
of Black futurity. As Kodwo Eshun argues (in relation to Afrofuturism
and the chronopolitics of Black time): "By creating temporal
complications and anachronistic episodes that disturb the linear time of
progress, these futurisms adjust the temporal logics that condemned
black subjects to prehistory" (2003, 297). Time travel has been
essential for colonial subjects precisely because temporal scripts hold
political spaces of subjugation in place, as somatic temporalities such
as the blues and spirituals have held the experience of epistemologies
of time to other clocks.9

#### The deployment of presumption traps affirmative solvency within the temporal bounds of speech times, disavowing the ongoing modes of relationality the 1AC's performance produces throughout the debate and between debaters, judges, and spectators.

[Another]{.underline} more nuanced, but still [problematic, way of
**deploying [presumption]{.mark}** [against **critical
aff**]{.mark}**irmative[s]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} it]{.underline} being
used [as [an inquiry into]{.mark} the [**timeframe**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[solvency]{.underline}]{.mark}**
mechanism of the affirmative. UTD Sendejas-Karchmer uses [the analytics
of "voting for them]{.underline} AFTER A 90MINUTE debate [doesn't
resolve]{.underline} any of [their offense -- the **[reading]{.mark} of
[the 1ac should have]{.mark} already [solved"]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(UTD Sendejas and Karchmer, 2023) [and]{.underline} NYU Layden and Modi
says "the 1AC has already been introduced into the debate. [Saying good
things does not warrant a ballot"]{.underline} (NYU Layden and Modi,
2023). In other words, these arguments [[forward]{.mark} that [if **the
aff**]{.mark}]{.underline}irmative [[is **not**]{.underline}]{.mark} an
inscribed textual object available for **[[fiated]{.underline}]{.mark}**
action, [**[the nine-minute]{.mark} time limit the [1AC]{.mark}** must
occur within [is the **only space**]{.mark}]{.underline} in which [they
**recognize [solvency]{.mark} to [occur]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our
model of rearticulation makes apparent that not only does the fiated
imaginary not have much relevancy when engaging this typology of
affirmative, but also that the magic of **[[performative
aff]{.mark}irmative[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** is able to
[**[escape]{.mark}** the [**temporal bounds** of **traditional**]{.mark}
**1AC [speech times]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} a result of its
**[constant]{.mark} modes of [relationality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To support the enactment of a given [policy by way of
**[fiat]{.mark}**]{.underline} is to necessarily
**[[sidestep]{.underline}]{.mark}** the question regarding [the
[**relationship** between]{.mark}]{.underline} the statement of [the
**action's [desirability]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**[performance]{.mark} of that statement**]{.underline}. Similarly,
**[[judges do not]{.underline}]{.mark}** actually
**[[enact]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of an affirmative [[when]{.mark} **[signing the ballot]{.mark}** for a
**fiated plan**, which]{.underline} begins to [**hollow-out** the
**logics** of a **temporal understanding of solvency
mechanisms**]{.underline}. The performative dimensions of this
recognition, however, can be disavowed when the space is viewed merely
as a laboratory for the testing of ideas rather than a space where
embodied performers practice of the performance of those ideas in front
of embodied critics who, themselves, perform in response. So long as
agency is located outside of the space of the debate and within the
institutionality of the state, debate can evacuate itself of its
performative dimensions. [[**Presumption** aids]{.underline}]{.mark} in
this evacuation through [the [notion]{.mark} that [**embodied
performance** is **not enough**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The production of
meaningful, contestable knowledge [and]{.underline} the enactment of
**[substantive]{.underline}** modes of **[political
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}** does not [[**begin and end**
at]{.underline}]{.mark} the demonstration of [**[legible policy
change]{.mark}** from the status quo.]{.underline}

Performance's magic exceeds the dichotomy of thought and action and
emerges through the way [subjective modes of relation are
changed]{.underline} in situ [through the]{.underline} continued,
iterated, and [repeated act of performance]{.underline}. Performance
engages in action through the transformation of political subjectivity
in the praxis of performance itself. E. Patrick Johnson (2011)
demonstrates how [[**performance** constitutes]{.underline}]{.mark} a
site for [the **[continued (re)negotiation of subjectivity]{.mark}**
pointing to]{.underline} two factors of performance: [**performative
preparation** and **embodied contingent iteration**]{.underline}
(429-431). First, while preparing for performance, the
performer/author/scholar begins understanding their lived experiences
and detailing how those experiences influence identities -- establishing
their space as a subject with agency through the space of performance.
Their proximate relationship with internalized lived experiences allows
the performer to conceptualize and articulate what worldly, contingent,
political and social forces may have been at play to inform their
viewpoint. [The [**relationality of performance** undermines]{.mark} the
**firm [division]{.mark}** [between **thought and action**]{.mark}: the
**act of [performing]{.mark}** is the **[rethink]{.mark}ing [the world
anew]{.mark}**. **Performance's [relational modes]{.mark} of address**
[provide]{.mark} **unique [epistemological sites]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
the [**exploration** of]{.mark} **political
[subjectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline} as it unfolds [[within
**the**]{.mark} **debate [round]{.mark}**. The **writing process**
provides]{.underline} moments of [exploration and escape for the
creator]{.underline} of the performance, [while **each listener's
relationship**]{.underline} to the information the performer is
conveying [constitutes **new modes of relational
possibility**]{.underline}. The second plane these affirmatives function
on is the plane of embodied contingent iteration. E. Patrick Johnson
indicates that, "each iteration of my 'self ' is always in relation to
who 'I' am in any given moment in my life history" (431) -- quickly
[mooting the common "you have already read this aff, that decks your
solvency" argumentation]{.underline} embedded in many presumption
arguments. While it may be correct that the decipherable words within
the performance may have been posited in previous rounds, [the
**performer's [relation]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the act of
**[[performing]{.underline}]{.mark}** those words **[[changes every
time]{.underline}]{.mark}** it is performed, [**[rejuvenating]{.mark}
the [capacity]{.mark}** for **more epistemological
revelations**]{.underline}. The gambit of performance debate is that
[the [**presumptive command** for]{.mark} a **defensible
[change]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the part of the affirmative [[can be
satisfied by]{.mark} the change the affirmative enacts within the
aesthetic of their [**performative orientation** and]{.mark} **its
insurgent [criticism]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the way life has been
arranged, even as it embodies survival and ongoing adjustment to that
arrangement.

### 2AC\-\--Extraction Bad

The political push is being reinforced by the Fit for 55 package
developed by the European Commission. It proposes to revise existing
European Union (EU) legislation to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions
by at least 55 % by 2030 and reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The
ambitious political goals are mainly translated in practice by
developing renewable energy, pushing towards a share of 40 % of the
total energy consumption in the EU by 2030. [The **rising demand for
[renewable energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} through batteries, solar
panels, or wind turbines [will [require **substantial mining**]{.mark}
**resources**]{.underline} (Danino-Perraud et al., 2023, IEA, 2023).

[The technologies developed for the production of electricity from
renewable energy]{.underline} do indeed [require an increased and
**[more]{.mark} diversified quantity** of **mineral [materials]{.mark}**
for a **constant quantity of energy** to be produced, [compared to
**traditional**]{.mark} **technologies** (**hydraulic**,
**[fossil]{.mark}** and **nuclear**)]{.underline}. Under the scenario,
Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) demands that key [**critical minerals**
([**lithium**, **cobalt**, **nickel**, **copper** and **neodymium**)
will increase]{.mark} by **1.5 to [7 times by
2030]{.mark}**]{.underline} (IEA, 2023).

The International Energy Agency (2023) further stresses that "mining
capacity for critical minerals needs to expand swiftly to get on track
with net zero goals", leading to increased investments for the mining
industry (Pitron, 2020). Pushed by this ongoing energy transition, the
demand for mining goods is further exacerbated by the constant growth in
technological innovations and tech consumer products. There are also
risks and trade-offs attached to low greenhouse gas emission electricity
generation technologies beyond the low footprint of renewable energy on
climate, health and ecosystems. In 2016 [[**UNEP** compared]{.mark} the
**material intensity** between **[different
tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline} (concentrating solar, photovoltaic,
coal, natural gas, hydro dam, wind and geothermal) [and [made]{.mark} a
**[direct link]{.mark}** between **higher mineral resource
requirements** and the **ever-increasing footprint induced on
land**]{.underline} (Özkaynak et al., 2012).

In 2019 a report from the World Bank (Maddox et al., 2019) confirmed
that mining schemes will be conducted at even larger scales, considering
the growing demand and the gains from mechanization, but also due to the
decrease in grades and number of easily exploitable deposits (Sérandour,
2020). The mining sector's rising demand for land will resonate in the
global land trade market and will also be a cause for concern for energy
security. This financing process on a global scale is creating tensions
between investing and target countries, and requires considering the
geographical dimensions of mining (Temper et al., 2018). Similarly, the
clean energy transition is affecting the nature of energy security which
depends on adequate and timely investments to ensure that supply stays
in line with demand (IEA, 2023).

[Grounded processes in **[mining]{.mark} activities** directly [impact
**local livelihoods** and **ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sovacool
et al., 2022). However, [global analyses of scale relationships, and
issues of **relocation of costs**, notably human, social and
environmental are **largely overlooked**]{.underline} in framing
documents. For instance, the latest report from the International Energy
Agency (2023) only acknowledges the magnitude of mining operations,
estimated a global coverage of one million square kilometers. But as a
financial asset, land is increasingly becoming "abstracted \[...\] from
its physical form" (Clapp, 2017). In the literature on energy justice,
Jenkins et al. (2016) and Healy and Barry (2017) among other scholars,
clearly identify the importance of a systemic approach when
conceptualizing climate justice. Largely overlooked in current
life-cycle analyses, Healy and Barry (2017) argue that more attention
should still be focused on the upstream part of the cycle as it is
characterized by important distributional issues. Attention should be
paid to territories where most energy injustices originate and human
rights are infringed (Fuller and McCauley, 2016). Without such effort,
[**accountability** remains **depoliticized** and **energy [transition
narratives]{.mark}** [remain **techno-optimistic**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Barry, 2016).

#### Even [assuming recycling]{.underline}.

In this way, the study solely attempts to highlight parts of the hidden
face of the energy transition. Alongside nature-based solutions, [the
energy transition is praised for its expected contribution to climate
change mitigation. But]{.underline} beyond the enthusiasm of the
economic sector, greater attention has recently been placed on the fact
that [**[clean energy]{.mark} technologies** [necessitate]{.mark} a
**[greater]{.mark} amount of [minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pitron,
2020). For instance, the International Energy Agency (2021) stressed
that [**[wind]{.mark} plants** [require **nine times more minerals**
than **gas**]{.mark}**-fired power [plants]{.mark}**[, and
**electric**]{.mark} **cars** [utilize **six times more**]{.mark}
**minerals** [compared to **conventional cars**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(IEA, 2021). [This **rising demand** is **hardly being studied** in
terms of **land imprint** and the context of **mineral extraction** to
feed international markets and supply chains]{.underline}.

As portrayed by Gregoir and van Acker (2022), [**[even if]{.mark}
western [countries]{.mark}** will [have]{.mark} **significant
[supply]{.mark}**]{.underline} in minerals [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
2040 due to **[[recycling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [secondary minerals,
**domestic [plans]{.mark}** to reduce import dependency and increase
volumes]{.underline} are not on the radar or [[will **not
match**]{.mark} **the [demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Looking at the
initial phase of the value chain (extraction), [the **[cost]{.mark} of
the transition** [will]{.mark} still [be borne by **developing
countries** rich in]{.mark} **critical [minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Renewable violence [surpasses]{.underline} fossils, condemning affected regions to [extinction]{.underline}.

In 2019, 2,743 cases of socio-environmental conflicts were documented in
the international database EJAtlas (Temper et al., 2018). [[Among
**all**]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[industrial
[sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}** considered (agriculture, forestry,
water, waste, nuclear, etc.), [the **[mining]{.mark} sector** [accounted
for]{.mark} the **[highest number of conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline},
with 573 cases, [[**surpassing** the **fossil**]{.mark} **energy
resources [sector]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sonter et al., 2020).
According to researchers from the EJAtlas (Temper et al., 2018), [the
**[main causes]{.mark} of socio-environmental conflicts** between mining
companies and local populations [are]{.mark} associated with the
**[violation of land rights]{.mark}** with **limited participation** and
consultation processes]{.underline} (Özkaynak et al., 2012).
Socio-environmental conflicts often lead to an escalation of tensions
between mining operators and the communities involved in the struggles
(Global Witness, 2022, Özkaynak et al., 2012, Sonter et al., 2020,
Tauli-Corpuz, 2017).

Among the communities experiencing human rights violations related to
the mining industry, John Ruggie noted in 2011 that indigenous peoples
were particularly affected (Ruggie, 2011). The conflict between
indigenous peoples and the mining industry stems from a fundamental
contradiction, creating a complex web of challenges. While the state
typically claims ownership of subsoil resources, local communities,
particularly indigenous populations, assert their rights to the land
above (Anaya, 2015). This divide, compounded by [the [mining sector's
**preference for remote**]{.mark} **areas** such as [**deserts**,
**forests**, and **islands**, where **marginalized groups**]{.mark},
including **indigenous communities [reside]{.mark}**, has become a
**[breed]{.mark}ing ground** for **socio-environmental
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bisht and De Roo, 2019, Scheidel et
al., 2020). [The ramifications]{.underline} for indigenous communities
[are nothing short of catastrophic]{.underline}, as described by Bisht
and De Roo (2019): ["**[Extractivism wreaks havoc]{.mark} on multiple
fronts**, unleashing a **cascade of consequences**---[**ecosystem
degradation**, **severed**]{.mark} **social [ties]{.mark}**[,
**eroded**]{.mark} **indigenous [cultures]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and
[the adoption of **ecologically [unsustainable
lifestyles]{.mark}**.".]{.underline}

Consequently, a multitude of socio-environmental conflicts emerge, with
indigenous peoples finding themselves at the forefront, battling to
protect their rights from the encroaching mining industry (Tauli-Corpuz,
2017). The root causes of these conflicts, reiterated by different
studies (FPP, 2006, Levacher, 2012, Bisht and De Roo, 2019), are
distressingly familiar: environmental destruction and habitat
disruption, [**population [displacement]{.mark}** and [**resettlement**,
**pollution** and]{.mark}]{.underline} its detrimental impact on public
health, [the **[criminalization of grassroots
movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the influx of foreign workers with
its attendant social challenges. [These grave impacts]{.underline} not
only violate universal human rights but also [**[jeopardize]{.mark} the
very [survival]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **indigenous
[peoples]{.mark}**]{.underline}, who find themselves cornered in the
shrinking spaces they call home (FPP, 2006, Bisht and De Roo, 2019).

Paradoxically, [governments]{.underline} often prioritize public
interest, [justify]{.underline}ing the imposition of [extractive
projects]{.underline} on indigenous lands [while
disregarding]{.underline} the welfare and rights of these [minority
groups, [favoring]{.mark} **national [economic
gains]{.mark}**]{.underline} (FPP, 2006). Consequently, [this
[engenders]{.mark} a **disturbing [climate of racism]{.mark}**
[among]{.mark} **non-indigenous [citizens]{.mark}**[,
facilitating]{.mark} their [**compliance** with]{.mark} **political
decisions that impose [mining projects]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, in some instances, [even justify the **use of
[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline} (FPP, 2006). A case in point is Peru,
where mining activities impacted less than three million hectares in
1992, but by 2000, had encroached upon a staggering 22 million hectares,
directly affecting 57 % of the recognized indigenous communities within
the country (SystExt, 2021).

[The issues inflicted]{.underline} upon indigenous peoples [by
**[mining]{.mark} projects** are not only **severe** and **systemic**
but also [pose]{.mark} **an [existential threat]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} their very existence in **[certain
[regions]{.mark} of the world]{.underline}** (FPP, 2006). The stress
inflicted by energy transitions and increased demand for resources
further underline the fundamental importance to protect legitimate
tenure rights. Securing the rights of those who live and work on the
land is the cornerstone of just transitions (Ciplet and Harrison, 2019).

Understanding infrastructure

According to Edwards et al. (2013, p. 15), "**[[knowledge
infrastructures]{.underline}]{.mark}** do not only provide new maps to
known territories---they reshape the geography itself." Although it is
difficult to precisely define the term "infrastructure" because of its
wide diversity, infrastructures can typically be understood as
"[**extended** material **assemblages that generate** effects and
structure **social relations**,]{.underline} either through engineered
(i.e., planned and purposefully crafted) or non-engineered (i.e.,
unplanned and emergent) activities" (Harvey et al. 2016, p. 5).
[**Infrastructures [are not neutral]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark} rather are
embedded within and express certain politics]{.underline} (Winner 1980).
Many scholars have documented the substantial, and often detrimental,
effects that material infrastructures of extraction have on communities
(Curley 2021; LaDuke and Cowen 2020; Pasternak and Dafnos 2018; Spice
2018). However, these material **[infrastructures]{.underline}** do not
exist alone; rather, they [[are **informed by**]{.mark} their **[social
environments]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as explained by Filion and Keil
(2017):

We cannot consider physical infrastructures independently of the
political, organizational, know-how and financial requirements for their
design, construction, operation and maintenance. For all their apparent
sturdiness, physical infrastructures are transient relative to the
societal conditions essential to their existence . . .
[**Infrastructures cannot be perceived as purely physical**
artefacts]{.underline}; they must be seen in their broad societal
context. (p. 8)

Material [**[infrastructures of extraction]{.mark}** are **[situated
within]{.mark}** a web of other interconnecting infrastructures,
including]{.underline} financial (Stanley 2016),
**[institutional]{.underline}** (Hall 2013), **[and [knowledge
infrastructures]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Hoogeveen 2016).

I frame EA as a knowledge infrastructure to highlight the power it has
over knowledge creation and communication.
**[Infrastructures]{.underline}** generally [are [**built and maintained
through**]{.mark} the "intensely political project of **[creating
and]{.mark} [communicating information]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
(Siemiatycki et al. 2020). Operationalizing the term "knowledge
infrastructure" in this context helps politicize the ways that knowledge
is accumulated, translated, and processed, as well as the
infrastructural arrangements that manage, contain, and distribute this
information (Edwards 2013). Much of the **[[infrastructural
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** of EA [**[relates to the]{.mark} types of**
**[knowledge prioritized]{.mark} and validated** [through this
process]{.mark}]{.underline}. Important questions about what constitutes
data, evidence, expertise, impact, risk, and health are moderated and
defined through EA (Myette 2022). And, the answers EA provides to those
questions recognize, affirm, [[**and amplify** a]{.mark} specific [type
of knowing grounded in **colonial**]{.mark} **history and [racial
logics]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Myette 2022). Edwards et al. (2013)
explain that "as [**knowledge infrastructures shape**, generate, and
distribute **knowledge,**]{.underline} they do so differentially, often
[**in ways [that]{.mark}** [encode and **reinforce
existing**]{.mark}]{.underline} interests and [relations of
**[power]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (p. 14). As such, beyond any effects on
people directly participating in this process, EA has other real-world
political implications for social relations [and
**hierarchies.**]{.underline}

[**[Communication drives extractivism]{.mark}**. The **[search
for]{.mark}**, **measurement**, **recovery**, [and **processing**
of]{.mark} **raw [materials]{.mark}** [relies on]{.mark}]{.underline}
increasingly complex and efficient [forms of **[info]{.mark}rmation
[sharing]{.mark}** [and **meaning making**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Large-scale [mines are born of]{.underline} geological
[maps]{.underline}, hydrological [models]{.underline}, economic
[spreadsheets]{.underline}, financial [algorithms]{.underline},
corporate [reports to shareholders, public policies, cultural norms,
wants and needs, and]{.underline} the [daily collaborative efforts and
social relations of miners]{.underline} themselves. In short,
[**[communication]{.mark}** is [**inseparable** from the **extractive
process**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, [**communication** plays]{.underline} a still more
[**fundamental role** in constituting extractivism. [**What counts** as
extractivism, **what resources**]{.mark} are **"critical" enough** to
[warrant]{.mark} the **social and ecological [devastation]{.mark}**
entwined [with]{.mark} their [excavation, **who should bear**]{.mark}
**these [costs]{.mark} and benefits**, **[what are]{.mark} viable
[alternatives]{.mark} to extractivism**]{.underline} (both political
economic and socio-cultural), [[and **who decides**]{.mark} **all of
[this]{.mark}**[, rely on]{.mark} the **politics of
[framing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Within communication studies, [**frames** are]{.underline} broadly
[defined as "mental structures that **shape the way we see the
world**"]{.underline} (Lakoff, 2004: xv) \[1\]. [[**How** we **perceive
reality** shapes **how** we **transform it**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Crucially, [frames are **always partial**]{.underline} in a double
sense. First, [they are **necessarily incomplete**. All frames
**emphasize** and **leave out different parts** of the
story]{.underline}. Second, [**what** gets emphasized or left
out]{.underline}, either consciously or more often unconsciously, [is a
**matter of politics**]{.underline}. For example, [**dominant
[framings]{.mark}** [of "**just**]{.mark} **energy
[transitions]{.mark}**[" in response to **"fossil**]{.mark} **fuel"
[extractivism]{.mark}**[, **obscures**]{.mark} **the
[injustices]{.mark}** [rendered by]{.mark} a **["clean" energy]{.mark}
sector** increasingly [reliant on **"dirty"**]{.mark} **metals** and
**[minerals]{.mark}** like **cobalt**, **copper**, and
**lithium**]{.underline}.

Extractive framing politics are cultural and economic. They are also
ecological. As political ecology and science and technology studies
(STS) teach us, [the social and ecological are themselves inseparable
within politics]{.underline}. From this perspective, we must restate
George Lakoff's claim that "reframing is social change" (Lakoff, 2004:
xv), to better read, "[reframing is socio-ecological
change]{.underline}." [**[Reframing]{.mark} just energy
[transitions]{.mark}** [as a **problem of**]{.mark}
**extractivism**--[**not just fossil fuel
extractivism**--transforms]{.mark} the **social and ecological
[requirements]{.mark}** of, **[activist demands]{.mark}** for,
[and]{.mark} **more-than-human [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
below) [[engaged in]{.mark} a **just energy
[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Scrutinizing the socio-ecological politics inherent in framing requires
one other amendment to our previous definition of frames. Namely,
[frames **don't simply shape** socio-ecological change. They **stem
from** it]{.underline}. That is, frames do not merely reflect and filter
the "real world" through "mental structures" (a stance that upholds the
material/ideational duality). Frames emerge from processual relations
(as much material as ideational) that involve a host of human and
non-human agents. Communication not only drives material processes, it
is a material process. This gives a whole new meaning to the phrase,
"communication matters." The politics of "matter"--the contested
struggles over where, why, and how resource extraction takes
place--occur throughout the extractive process. And this process is
necessarily communicative.

The emergence of [**lithium** as a **"clean" mineral**
provides]{.underline} a [**clear example** of the **materiality of
extractivism communication**]{.underline}. What makes lithium
discursively "green" is not simply a matter of discourse alone, nor of
cultural or ideational politics. [Lithium has a **specific materiality**
that interacts with people]{.underline}, technology, water, cultural
landscapes, ephemeral capitalist [geographies]{.underline}, and
million-year-old geologies, among a host of other more-than-human
actants [and processes that **guide**]{.underline} the
**[reframing]{.underline}** process. More concretely, [[**what makes
lithium "green"** is]{.mark} its [**distinction**
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [materialities of **["dirty"]{.mark} coal,
oil, and gas [extractivisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Lithium extractivism
is not yet associated with black lung disease, mountaintop removal, or
unfettered greenhouse gas emissions. The adjective "green" attributed to
lithium is not a phantom untethered from the material world. It is
rooted in the material world--in culture, in political economy, in
ecology.

And yet, [lithium's]{.underline} materiality cuts both ways. Its
[**["greenness"]{.mark}** in comparison to other natural resources [does
**not reflect**]{.mark} **innocent [reality]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}
rather, [evokes]{.mark} a [**particular ontological frame** of
**the**]{.mark} **material [world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As we'll see,
[an **alternative relational frame** of extractivism casts lithium's
materiality in a **radically dirtier light**]{.underline}. But before
delving into the necessary reframing work at hand, let us briefly
recount the dominant frame of extractivism.

Recent work by Eduardo Gudynas (2021) reminds us that [extractivism is
**not homogenous**. Extractiv**isms** are **plural**]{.underline}. It is
this very plurality--this [argument that [**not all extractivisms**
are]{.mark} **created [equal]{.mark}**]{.underline}--that **[[gives
lithium]{.mark} its [claim to "greenness"]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[2\].
Seen as a thing, a pre-constituted resource with an innate essence,
lithium can be unequivocally isolated and compared to other isolated and
essentialized resources. [[Lithium is **not coal**]{.mark}. It is **not
[cobalt]{.mark}**. It is **not [copper]{.mark}**[. It is]{.mark}
**materially [greener]{.mark} than them**. [This]{.mark} is the
**[hegemonic]{.mark} logic and [framing]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **clean
[energy transitions]{.mark}**]{.underline} espoused by the Left
worldwide. It [[is **also**]{.mark} **the logic** [underlying]{.mark}
**the Right's [rhetoric]{.mark}** [that **praises**]{.mark} **natural
[gas]{.mark}** [as **a "bridge" to cleaner
energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More fundamentally, it is a framing which
the uncritical analysis of extractive plurality leaves intact.

While certainly useful, analysis of plurality--of the [typologies of
extractivism]{.underline} or the differences between resources--can only
take us so far. [**[To]{.mark} better [comprehend]{.mark}** [what counts
as]{.mark} **clean or dirty [extractivism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
more fundamentally, what constitutes extractivism itself, [[requires
analyses of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**material-discursive
[relations]{.mark}** [that **bind**]{.mark} **supposedly distinct
[resources]{.mark}** [and **extractivisms**]{.mark} together. It
requires an **ontological reframing** of extractivism that moves
from]{.underline} the [**division** and **comparison**]{.underline}
inherent in the notion of plurality [towards]{.underline} the **[mutual
constitution]{.underline}** articulated [within]{.underline} the concept
of **[relationality]{.underline}**.

### Models K\-\--2AC

#### [Logistics DA]{.underline}\-\--Imposing a universal model of debate is a form of logistical rationality that seeks to predict, standardize, and erase alternative epistemologies considered a threat to the smooth functioning and flow of infrastructure.

CONTEMPORARY LOGISTICAL FORMATIONS," Doctoral Thesis,

MAIN ARGUMENTS & APPROACH

This thesis argues that [logistics can be]{.underline} fruitfully
[understood as a rationality]{.underline} -- or rather, that considering
the underlying rationality of logistics allows us to see beyond its
relatively distinct 'new imperial imaginary', as Cowen has shown us, to
excavate the coloniality of power that animates contemporary logistical
organisation. 4 **[[Logistical rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I
contend, [has come to **[pervade]{.mark}** the **organisation of** our
**[politics]{.mark}**, economics, industry]{.underline} and further, our
[**[subjectivities and]{.mark}** forms of
**[sociality]{.mark}**]{.underline} at ever more intimate levels and
with increasingly finer granularity. The specificity of my approach lies
in identifying key logics and the epistemic underpinnings of logistical
rationality in order to clarify the ways in which [the
**[models]{.mark}** it deploys to represent reality [have **become
infrastructural** to]{.mark} the organisation of [the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. I take seriously the claim that
[**[Western]{.mark} [modernity is]{.mark}** [a]{.mark} continuing
[construction **made possible through**]{.mark} deleterious forms of
representation and [**racialisation**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
instantiation of a [naturalised **[hierarchy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[This has **structured how we think**]{.mark}, how we can **[live,
and]{.mark}** how we **[produce knowledge]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We
must then seriously interrogate what has been seen as a largely physical
manifestation and extension of the project of modernity -- logistics
proper -- and begin to think about how its own underlying rationality
and epistemic framework is consonant and continuous with its
constitutive underside, coloniality.

SPECIFIC LOGICS

The logics I identify point to [techniques of **rationalisation,
and**]{.underline} a positivistic, [**universalising**]{.underline}
tendency. Logistical rationality [is **underpinned by** a regime of
quantification, calculation and **modelling**]{.underline} which is
heavily influenced by or modelled on cybernetic thought. A cybernetic
understanding of the world is one that sees everything as series of
interconnected systems of communication and control -- with a focus on
what they do, not what they are. These systems are made up of 'animal
and machine'5 in the words of Weiner, or for Ashby, cybernetics, or
\[t\]he art of "steersmanship" deals with all forms of behaviour in so
far as they are regular, or determinate, or reproducible ... \[it\]
stands to the real machine \-- electronic, mechanical, neural, or
economic \-- much as geometry stands to real objects in our terrestrial
space. ... \[and\] offers a method for the scientific treatment of the
system in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be
ignored'6

I argue that cybernetic thought and method, which necessitates [the
**[translation of real-]{.mark}world** systems]{.underline} [and
behaviours **[into]{.mark}**]{.underline} quantifiable variables and
[**[models]{.mark}, is** a foundation of **logistical
rationality**]{.underline}. Furthermore, I argue that [**these processes
amount to** forms of]{.underline} translation, replication,
[**[standardisation and erasure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the
translation of ever more of the world in the form of data, metrics,
abstract **[[models]{.mark} and]{.underline}** replicable
[**infrastructure**,]{.underline} models and data have [**[become
a]{.mark}** [dominant **mode of representing**]{.mark} the world and
**[what counts as knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} about it. These
disparate but continuous programmes of quantifying, translating and
**[standardising]{.underline}** then serve to [**erase** other **ways of
knowing and** possibilities for **organising the world
otherwise**.]{.underline}

Standardisation here should be thought of as an integral part of
processes of translation into logistical legibility -- the mechanism by
which the world is translated and represented in such a way that it can
be replicated and repeated in kind. Further, in this context,
standardisation is a normative process by which [a **standard**
is]{.underline} delineated and [**set** as **[a benchmark]{.mark} [for
the correct way of doing things]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
[[epistemologically, procedurally, and materially]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As a logistical process, [**standardisation [aims at]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark} [removal]{.mark} and **smoothing away** [of **obstacles**
to]{.mark} replication]{.underline}. Concurrently, [standardisation
should be seen as another way of **controlling
uncertainty**]{.underline} -- as a form of logistical translation,
[**standardisation aims at** the production of [**a more certain
future** through]{.mark} **rendering** normative the
**[models]{.mark}**]{.underline} and forms [said to delineate various
kinds [**of 'best practice'**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Prediction is thus
another central logic in this narrative -- the frontier-like orientation
toward the future that aims to bring it under control.

Another important feature of logistical rationality is its extractive
logic -- in the very literal sense of the extractive industries such as
mining and intensive agricultures -- but also in terms of the extraction
of value in dependent debt relationships, and the extraction of data
about populations (and its subsequent translation& production into
knowledge). Thought of in this expanded sense, extraction allows us to
acknowledge affinities with modern forms of counterinsurgency --
thinking here about attempts to extract knowledge about 'enemy'
populations in wartime in order to make war more efficient; or in
'development' projects with the dual-purpose of securing an extractive
debt relationship and/or loyalty to the financing nation.7 It also then
revolves around processes of inclusion and exclusion from its networks.8

Logistics is also widely understood as a spatial phenomenon, as Cowen
amongst others show us. I show that [[**logistical rationality is**
predicated on a desire]{.mark} for **control over not only space, but
temporality** too -- working with the logic of prediction,]{.underline}
[**logistical rationality attempts [to predict and control
future]{.mark}** events.]{.underline} Lysandrou goes so far as to say
that [the **[future]{.mark} [is]{.mark}** [being
**colonized**]{.mark}]{.underline} by processes of financialization;
alongside Zuboff who argues that [our "**will to [future]{.mark}**[" is
**under threat by**]{.mark} the **predictive** products-turned
**behavioural modification technologies** under]{.underline} what she
calls [[surveillance capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. 9 Fundamentally, I
argue that logistical rationality dreams the annihilation of distance
and time in the delivery of goods, services, and information.

#### Dialogical Hegemony DA\-\--Prescriptive models of debate obfuscate the situated, relational, material circumstances in which such discursive practices take place (the who, when, where, and how of debate) to justify the continual restriction, distortion, and erasure of any form of knowledge that falls outside its formal, idealized communicative process.

Dialogue as Decontextualized Pedagogy

The crucial shift in perspective outlined here is from [a
[**prescriptive model of dialogue** as a **neutral**]{.mark}
**communicative [process]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a procedure [in [which
**all participants** are]{.mark} [treated **equally**, concerned]{.mark}
only [with]{.mark} the **[search for knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
understanding, and perhaps agreement, to dialogue as a situated
practice, one implicated by the particulars of who, when, where, and how
the dialogue takes place. The elevation of dialogue as a general
pedagogical method [**abstracts its operations** from]{.underline} those
[particulars and,]{.underline} as noted earlier, [[treats
**deviations**]{.mark} **from that ideal** [as]{.mark} either
**illegitimate [violations of]{.mark} its [rules]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
as **unfortunate [shortcomings]{.mark}** [that can be **remedied**
through]{.mark} **the application of [more of the
same]{.mark}**]{.underline}---continuing with [dialogue]{.underline}
until these failures of understanding or agreement can be remedied.
**[Radical [difference]{.mark}]{.underline}**, difference [[that
resists]{.mark} accommodation or [assimilation, is rendered]{.mark}
**inexplicable** or **[perverse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But when one
examines the who, when, where, and how of dialogue, such
characterizations become much more difficult to defend.21

WHO. The first issue begins with the growing diversity of classrooms (at
all levels of education) and the increasing awareness of the margins or
borders of common school culture as it interacts with the very different
values and orientations that students bring to the classroom. The
conditions of globalization and mobility have promoted both direct forms
of migration across national/cultural categories and (especially with
the rise of new communication and information technologies) an
increasing proximity and interaction of multiple lines of
national/cultural influence. In this context, the central assumptions of
common schooling---of a canon of texts, of a shared historical
tradition, of a common language---are thrown into question, since even
where such elements might be defended, their value and significance are
going to be regarded differently from different positions as teachers
and students. In some cases they will be directly challenged. The shift
to a dialogical approach, in itself, does not remedy these conflicts;
and when more radical conceptions of difference are at stake, the very
notion of "remedying" such conflicts and disagreements becomes deeply
problematic.

[A [dialogue is **not** an engagement of]{.mark}]{.underline} two (or
more) [**[abstract persons]{.mark}**, but of people with
characteristics, styles, values, and assumptions that shape
the]{.underline} particular [ways in which they engage in discourse. Any
prescriptive conception of dialogue must confront the challenge of
acknowledging]{.underline} persons who do not engage in communication
through those forms and [**who** might]{.underline} in fact [be
**excluded** or]{.underline} disadvantaged by them. Conversely, an
account of dialogue that acknowledges the enormous multiplicity of forms
in which people from different cultures do enact pedagogical
communicative relations (let alone communicative relations generally)
needs to address the question of [why **some**]{.underline} versions
[are **rewarded** with the prescriptive label "dialogue" and others are
not.]{.underline}

Aside from the multiplicity of communicative forms, there is also a
multiplicity of communicative purposes in dialogue. In many contexts,
for example, the formation and negotiation of identity may constitute
the primary purpose in mind for some participants in a dialogical
relation, supplanting more overt teaching-learning goals. Such dynamics
may be only partly intended or conscious (and hence only partly
susceptible to reflection or change). [**[Participation]{.mark} in
dialogue**, even at the microlevel of apparent personal "choice," [is
**not**]{.mark} **simply [a]{.mark} matter of [choice]{.mark}**. The
utterances that comprise]{.underline} an ongoing [dialogue are already
made (or not made) in]{.underline} the context of [an awareness of the
reactions---real, anticipated, or imagined---of other
participants]{.underline}. The more that one pushes this sort of
analysis, the more the achievement, or suppression, of dialogical
possibilities comes to be seen as an expression of a group interdynamic,
and not something resulting simply from the choices and actions of
individuals.

WHEN. We do not just use language; language uses us. As Bakhtin argued,
the nature of discourse is that the language we encounter already has a
history; the words that we speak have been spoken by others before us
(he calls this "the internal dialogism of the word").22 As a result,
what we speak always means more than we mean to say; the language that
we use carries with it implications, connotations, and consequences that
we can only partly intend. The words that others hear from us, how they
understand them, and what they say in response are beyond our unilateral
control. The multivalence of discourse situates specific speech acts or
relations in a web of potential significations that is indeterminate,
nonlinear, and highly susceptible to the effects of context and cultural
difference.

[A [dialogue]{.mark} is **not simply a momentary
engagement**]{.underline} between two or more people; [it [is a
**discursive relation** situated against]{.mark} the **[background of
previous relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} involving them
[and]{.underline} the relation of what they are speaking today to [the
**history of those words spoken before** them]{.underline}. These
background conditions are also not simply matters of choice, and they
impinge upon the dialogical relation in ways that may shape or limit the
possibilities of communication and understanding. Often [these
relations]{.underline} are expressed [as **forms of [power]{.mark}** or
**privilege**]{.underline}, because the relative positions of people
[[place]{.mark} **asymmetrical [constraints]{.mark}** [on **who can
speak**]{.mark}, who can [**be heard**, and]{.mark} who [has a **stake
in maintaining a particular dialogue or**]{.mark} **in [challenging
it]{.mark}**. The **[prescriptive model]{.mark} of dialogue** has
[reinforced a view of dialogue as]{.mark} a **finite** and
**[bounded]{.mark} engagement**]{.underline}, often described
[[with]{.mark} little or [no]{.mark}]{.underline} context and with scant
[[consideration]{.mark} given [to what]{.mark}]{.underline} might have
[[transpired **before** or **may**]{.mark} **transpire
[after]{.mark}**]{.underline} the dialogue at hand. [This has tended to
support the idea of a dialogue as [a]{.mark} **unitary, [goal-oriented
conversation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a discrete purpose and a
beginning, middle, and end, [[not]{.mark} as **a slice of an [ongoing
communicative relation]{.mark}**, as it nearly always is in
**educational settings**]{.underline}.

WHERE. Recent years have seen a growth of interest in such problems as
situated cognition, group learning, the relation of expert and novice
understandings, real-world problem solving, distributed intelligence,
and a whole range of similar notions that address in different ways the
actual means by which the learning of individuals occurs in the contexts
of existing social relations and practice.

These concerns apply directly to the matter of dialogue. [The
situatedness of dialogue]{.underline}, considered as a discursive
practice, [means]{.underline} that the [**dialogical [relation]{.mark}**
[depends]{.mark} not only [upon]{.mark} what people are
saying]{.underline} to each other, [but [**the context** in which they
come together]{.mark}]{.underline} (the classroom or the cafeteria, for
example), where they are positioned in relation to each other (standing,
sitting, or communicating on-line), [and what]{.underline} other
gestures or [activities work with or against the grain of the
interaction. Dialogue has a **materiality**]{.underline}, which means
paying attention to [both facilitating and inhibitive
characteristics]{.underline} in the circumstances under which it takes
place. Nor is it simply a matter of the present context at hand but also
of other contexts---including anticipated future contexts of need or
use---[that shape the]{.underline} understanding of [purposes that
guide]{.underline} or direct a [dialogical engagement]{.underline}. For
example, interactions at home, in the playground or lunchroom, or on the
street before or after school may constitute contexts of teaching and
learning that are at least as important for certain participants as the
interaction in the classroom; and relative importance aside, they
certainly impinge upon the thoughts, feelings, and motivations
participants bring to the classroom.

HOW. Another aspect of this situatedness, or materiality, is that the
texts and objects of representation that mediate classroom discourse can
have distinctive effects on what can be said and how it can be
understood. Where interaction takes place in an immediate, face-to-face
circumstance, these "texts" include not only the words themselves, but
facial expressions, gestures, and similar representational forms. Yet
dialogue often also takes place in mediated forms: a dialogue between a
book's reader and its author; a dialogue between correspondents writing
to one another; a dialogue over a telephone; a dialogue through e-mail;
and so on. The tendency of previous accounts of dialogue has been to
ignore such factors or, if they are considered at all, to relegate them
to trivial significance compared to what the words themselves express.
Yet [substantial **[research]{.mark}**]{.underline} across a range of
fields [has [highlighted]{.mark} the [ways in which]{.mark}]{.underline}
the circumstances of [**[form]{.mark}** and **medium**]{.underline} are
not trivial but [[can influence **what is said** and **how it is
understood**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the ways in which these media are
signifying elements themselves.23

In these four ways, then, the [prescriptive]{.underline} account of
[dialogue has been impeded by the **formal, [idealized models]{.mark}**
through which it has been characterized]{.underline}: impeded [because
**these models** [have]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[not taken account of
**the**]{.mark} **situated, relational, material
[circumstances]{.mark}** [in which]{.mark} **such discursive
[practices]{.mark}**]{.underline} actually [[take
place]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attending to the social dynamics and
contexts of classroom discourse heightens the awareness of the
complexities and difficulties of changing specific elements within
larger communities of practice. These communities may be the primary
shapers of teaching and learning processes, but not always in ways that
serve intended or ideal educational objectives; other purposes, such as
identity-formation or negotiating relations of group solidarity, may
predominate. [The power of]{.underline} such [**[social
processes]{.mark}** may **[restrict]{.mark} lines of
[inquiry]{.mark}**[, **distort**]{.mark} **dialogical
[interactions]{.mark}**[, and **silence
perspectives**]{.mark}]{.underline} in ways that conflict with the
explicit purposes of education.

### Fiat K\-\--2AC

#### [STATE ADDICTION DA]{.underline} -- the imposition of fiat maintains a possessive investment in an epistemological ordering of debate that requires dependency on the state. This is pathological affliction that necessitates the violent reconditioning and extermination of all forms of ungovernable behaviors. 

**Quan 17** (H.L.T. Quan is an Associate Professor of Justice and Social
Inquiry in the School of Social Transformation at Arizona State
University, 2017, Chapter 11: "It's Hard to Stop Rebels That Time
Travel: Democratic Living and the Radical Reimagining of Old Worlds,"
Futures of Black Radicalism, Verso, pp. 173-193,
https://www.education.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Quan-ungovernability.pdf)

The famed, British-trained, American political scientist Richard Rose
famously stated, "Analytically, the concept of ungovernability is a
nonsense."14 Rose argued that, first, "the question is not whether we
shall be governed but how," second, "ungovernability can only be a
temporary phase of anarchy and of civil war,"15 and, third, "for better
or worse," being governed is a natural state, and being ungoverned is an
aberration that needs to be corrected. This view naturalizes the idea of
order and norms political authority as rational. Governability is thus
ontological: we are the way we are governed, and being ungoverned is
nonbeing. [**[State evasion and]{.mark}** other forms of
**[avoidance]{.mark}** of being governed **[are deviant behavior that
necessitates disciplining]{.mark}**, from reconditioning to total
annihilation.]{.underline}

Ideationally then, [[the **ungovernable**]{.mark} has been
**[conscripted as a problem]{.mark}** subject]{.underline}, and one that
needs reform. Sociologists, for instance, often focus on problem-people
and communities, those who have been normed and scaled as the gendered
and/or racialized other. At one time or another, [**indigenous people,
Arabs, Mexicans, Muslims, Africans, single women,** **and LBGTQ people**
have been]{.underline} among the "other," who have been [**thought of
as** **problem people [in need of]{.mark}** [**being**]{.mark}
governed]{.underline}, tamed, subdued, [and, in certain circumstances,
**[annihilated]{.mark}**]{.underline} altogether. It is presumed and
argued that these ungovernable cannot be reasoned with; they are evil
and will only understand the language of force.16 Similarly, certain
spaces, especially urban spaces, are seen as ungovernable. The West Side
of Phoenix, Harlem, Cabrini Green, Watts, Detroit, large swaths of the
Global South, and the entirety of the Third World are problem peoples
and spaces because they are ungovernable, appearing together as a an
entire cosmology, a fearsome Black planet. The poor, Black people of
Ferguson, Chicago, East Los Angeles, and Harlem---and anywhere there are
ungovernable lives---are problem subjects, especially in communities
where Black lives matter. [The rational choice that follow entails
everything the capacious apparatuses and technologies of violence have
to offer, including "evacuation," mass incarceration, deportation,
tanks, guns, tear gas, and surveillance]{.underline}. In the aftermath
of the killing of Michael Brown and the ensuing protests, Ferguson
became an ungovernable problem-space, with the majority of its people
and even its police force deemed troublesome. Former attorney general
Eric Holder was regularly dispatched to troubled/ungovernable regions,
enforcing coherence on the progressively implausible imperial narrative
about American exceptionalism.17 Then there is the frequent and
increasingly amplified speechifying by the first Black president in
defense of liberal democracies and their attendant ideologies,
justifying the perpetual wars on the troublesome Middle East or South
Asia or North Africa.

All the while, in political science, ungovernability scandalously
continues to be dismissed as analytical nonsense. While [[the
**framing** of]{.mark} **[the ungovernable is
used]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with great frequency and utility, [to cast
and organize people and lands, **[to justify]{.mark}** and wage
**[permanent wars and]{.mark}** even **[genocide]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
in political science---the field tasked with helping us understand how
we come by these policies---its mandarins persist in their views that
ungovernability is conceptually nonsensical. [[This]{.mark} scandalous
intent **[suggests an ideography that owes its pathos to]{.mark} and
possessive investments on** [an epistemological]{.mark} [ordering that
relies on **state addiction**]{.mark}. [**This affliction** is a
pathology that **renders its sufferers**]{.mark} **entirely [dependent
on the state]{.mark}** for sensibility and intelligence]{.underline}.
The symptoms are many and obvious: most prominent is the tendency to
conflate government with governing, authority with leadership, and rule
with submission.18 [**State-centric analytics** **commit addicts to a
certain notion of the state**, even to the extent of the state becoming
the very fiction that we fear.]{.underline} 19

Take for instance the eminent architect of deconstructionism, Jacques
Derrida, who conflated sovereignty with transcendence. According to
Derrida, "sovereignty is in a certain manner un-historical, it is a
contract made with a history contracting itself into the punctiform
event of an exceptional decision without temporal and historical
expansion. Thus sovereignty also withdraws itself from language."20 So
it is: timeless and outside of history; moreover, [there is, "**[no
sovereignty without violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, without the force
of the stronger, the justification of which---as the right of the
strongest---consists in its power over everything."21 [The **sovereign
has power over everything,** including life itself.]{.underline}

Rather than imagining the future in terms of democractic living,
sensibilities, and formations of justice, [**[state addicts]{.mark}**
leave us **[dependent on]{.mark} the [state for]{.mark}** means of
[expressions and **terms of engagement**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Their
**[imaginary]{.mark}** **[domains]{.mark}2**]{.underline}2
[are]{.underline} thus entirely [**[dependent on]{.mark} the [state's
projections]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The state's memory becomes our own
memory]{.underline}. Just as Orlando Patterson's social death thesis
fallaciously endows racial capitalism and white supremacy as cultural
progenitors of Black life, so [state analytics such as
**necropolitics**]{.underline}23 **[render life sans
state]{.underline}**, more often than not, **[chaotic, miserable and
inauthentic]{.underline}**.24 Within the same frame of social death, as
David Brion Davis has argued, Black enslaved people have "no legitimate,
independent being, no place in the cosmos except as an instrument of
\[their\] master's will."25 Similarly, life sans state, as Hobbes
declared in the Leviathan, is "evil, brutish and short."

### AT: TVA\-\--2AC

#### Interest Convergence DA\-\--Clash/TVA is simply Adding black scholarship to white curriculum cause appropriation (MPX: epistemic appropriation/knowledge extraction)

Banks (2006, 94) refers to these **[[appropriative
stances]{.underline}]{.mark}** as ethnic additive paradigms, [in which
"**ethnic content** can be **[add]{.mark}ed** [to]{.mark} the
[curriculum **without**]{.mark} **reconceptualizing or
[restructuring]{.mark}**]{.underline}." These approaches [are
"**designed primarily** [to **silence ethnic protest**]{.mark} rather
than to **contribute to equality** and to the **structural inclusion**
of **ethnic groups**"]{.underline} (Banks 2006, 97). [The result of this
**appropriative**]{.underline} stance, in which curriculum is required,
but the underlying knowledges, languages, and lived realities are
structurally excluded, is an [**embrace** of **superficial
diversity**]{.underline}. [[This leads to **celebrations of
difference**]{.mark} while **[hiding]{.mark} ongoing [structural
racism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **continually [centring
whiteness]{.mark}** [as **the norm**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Stewart
(2017) argued, "acknowledgment and celebration of diversity were not the
primary goals of the student activists of the 1960s through the 1980s,
who pushed for ethnic studies departments, student centers and increased
recruitment and retention efforts focused on racially minoritised
students, faculty members and staff members."

Teaching about others' perspectives, often by someone without lived
experience and indepth study, can lead to erasing differences in
privileged status and identity nuances, and reframes ethnic studies as
content rather than a movement. Such teaching about is fostered by
requirements to teach ethnic studies and diversity courses, which, in
the current examples, will increasingly be taught by those who are
already in place to teach, namely White teachers already teaching about
people of colour. [This is precisely how **[appropriation]{.mark} works
to [reinforce whiteness]{.mark}** [while]{.mark} **symbolically
[claiming]{.mark}** [to **expand**]{.mark} **(and indeed, require)
ethnic studies**. This **interest convergence** enables]{.underline} a
shift from advocating for "of, by, and for" towards focusing on
preparing White teachers to teach [**[ethnic-specific content]{.mark}**,
**[removed from]{.mark}** the **larger [Black, Indigenous]{.mark}, and
community of colour [knowledge systems]{.mark}** from which ethnic
studies comes]{.underline}. While many powerful ethnic studies courses
will be allowed and encouraged through such advocacy, a transformative
educational approach to P-20 systems will remain off the table.

A Way Forward

Banks (2006, 209) argues, "[A **transformative curriculum** cannot be
constructed [merely]{.mark} by **[adding content]{.mark} about cultural
groups**]{.underline} and women [[to]{.mark} the **[existing Eurocentric
curriculum]{.mark}** or by]{.underline} integrating or **[infusing
cultural content]{.underline}** or content about women [into the
**mainstream curriculum**]{.underline}." Yet schools and colleges are
**[designed to [colonise]{.mark}]{.underline}** the internal and
external [**[voices]{.mark}** that **advocate for
transformation**]{.underline}. Despite, and perhaps because of this
continued coloniality, the Movement for Black Lives continues to
advocate for a centring of intersectional Blackness and an unapologetic
commitment to Black survival. Some efforts to diversify the teacher
workforce continue to challenge racialised barriers and the dominance of
whiteness in teacher education and school district operations. And some
in the movement for ethnic studies call for the emergence of ethnic
studies as a foundational way to reorganise **[[educational
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All three movements [[are **built
on**]{.mark} **generations of**]{.underline} struggle against
[**violent, [colonial educational infrastructures]{.mark}**, linked to
**[policing Black bodies]{.mark}**, **controlling Black
[minds]{.mark}**[, and **assimilating Black
hearts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Thus, [interest convergence offers a continual reminder that [efforts to
transform]{.mark} from [racism]{.mark} operate within **colonial,
anti-Black structures** designed to **cause harm**]{.underline}. Deeper,
interest convergence serves as a warning that [**strategies** [that rely
upon **White acceptance** will **not transform** the]{.mark}
**infrastructures of [coloniality]{.mark}** []{.mark}baked into the
**foundation [of educational systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While these
examples are germane to the United States, the same strategies of
appropriation operate across African educational transformation efforts,
and interest convergence offers a theoretical approach to reorganise
decolonial movement building to reflect the difficulties of dislodging
oppression from its foundational tools.

### AT: Fairness\-\--2AC

#### Procedural fairness turn debate into an instrumentally rational, labor-like process

Understanding Instrumental Play

The assumption behind mainstream proceduralism is that the meaning of
games is contained exclusively in the formal system of the game. What
players do is to reconfigure the meanings embedded in the rules defined
by the designers. Playing, then, becomes accepting and learning from the
system-based message embedded in the game.

One of the main strengths of proceduralism, considered from a designer's
perspective, is that it grants great power and influence to the
designer. Of course, educated designers, reflective practitioners
(Schön, 2007), are aware of players' creativity, and are cautious when
arguing for the full extent of the proceduralist perspective. However,
as it was suggested in the previous section, in their writings some
designers still resort to proceduralism as the main argument for
justifying both their artistic ambition and the possibility of games to
create complex ethical and political messages.

Again, [**procedurality** claims]{.underline} that it is [the system of
**rules** and **mechanics**]{.underline} that [conveys the message of
the game; players should **follow those rules** in order to configure
the **designer-encoded meanings** by means of "**simulation
fever**"]{.underline} and the ambiguity of the simulation,

This understanding of games, however, fosters the idea that to design
ethical or political experiences through games is to codify arguments in
the game system. When playing by those rules, players will be ethically
or politically affected, or persuaded. The proceduralist claim for the
effectiveness of games as a means for social and political content is
centered on the formal nature of games, as much as the argument for
games being art defended by the proceduralists is based on the fact that
games have rules designed to create experiences. If it is in the rules,
it is what the game is and means, therefore preserving the designers'
authority and a relatively unidirectional communication model, hence the
aforementioned importance of author statements in the work of some
independent developers. However, [this model takes away the importance
of play and players]{.underline} in the configuration of the ludic
experience. In this sense, [[**proceduralism** is]{.mark} a model that
calls for **[instrumental play]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**Instrumental play** is a concept]{.underline} that, for the purposes
of this article, adapts the theories of Adorno and Horkheimer to the
context of explaining the limits [of understanding [games as **mere
procedural systems of meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The term
"instrumental play" has been used before in game studies (Taylor, 2006).
This chapter introduces another interpretation of the term, expanding on
previous work but focusing on a more precise definition oriented to
explaining the ethical and political underpinnings of proceduralism.

[Instrumental play is]{.underline} a take on the concept of
**[[instrumental rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}** first written by the
Frankfort School of critical theory in the 1950s. Essentially,
[instrumental rationality]{.underline} is an argument used in the
critique of modernity [and its faith on a model of reason]{.underline}
that, despite its focus on prove and evidence, [is]{.underline} still
[deeply [rooted in **myth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fundamental
tension between myth and reason, and the excessive focus of
enlightenment on reason as ends for the means of the modern revolution.
In other words: [reason [becomes]{.mark} **an end**[, **a
justification** for **all**]{.mark} **[actions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and what [Enlightenment]{.underline} does is to [**rationalize all
processes** in order **to justify them**, even if those processes
are]{.underline} deeply rooted in [myth]{.underline}, in the irrational,
in those aspects outside of the frames of rationality.

Horkheimer and Adorno's critique of enlightenment is one of the
fundamental texts in critical theory. However, this is not the place to
write an exegesis of it. The purpose of this section is to introduce
some of the key aspects of critical theory as relevant for defining the
type of instrumentality that explains how proceduralists understand
play.

[For proceduralists, games have meanings]{.underline} that are [**prior
to the act of playing the game**, and]{.underline} somewhat [determine
the meaning of the game; there is an essence to any game, and that
essence is]{.underline} to be [found in **the rules**]{.underline}. In
words of The Dialectic of Enlightenment: \"For enlightenment is as
totalitarian as any system \[\...\] for enlightenment [the process is
**always decided from the start**]{.underline}\" (Adorno and Horkheimer,
2010, p. 24). Much like Enlightenment, then, [[**proceduralism** is a
**determinist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps even [**totalitarian
[approach]{.mark} to play**; an approach that **[defines]{.mark} the
[action prior to]{.mark} its [existence]{.mark}**[, and denies]{.mark}
the importance of [anything]{.mark} that was [not determined
before]{.mark} **the act of [play]{.mark}**, in]{.underline} the system
design of [the game]{.underline}.

The problem with this understanding of reason is that, in critical
theory terms, it is used to substitute myth and ritual in our culture,
becoming the center of cultural and economic modernity: "the technical
process, into which the subject has objectified itself after being
removed from the consciousness, is free of the ambiguity of mythic
thought as of all meaning altogether, because reason itself has become
the mere instrument of the all-inclusive economic apparatus."(ibid, p.
30). But play belongs to the myth domain (Huizinga, 1992; Gadamer,
2004), to the area of rituals as much as to the domain of reason. If
modernity despises ritualism, then games and play should shy away from
what cannot be reasoned. [[Games]{.underline}]{.mark}, then,
[[become]{.mark} an [instrument for **reason**]{.mark}, and not for
play]{.underline}.

[[This leads to]{.mark} an understanding of **play**, and **leisure**,
as [**mechanical outcomes**]{.mark} of processes]{.underline}; outcomes
[[that follow **the same**]{.mark} **production and consumption
[models]{.mark}**]{.underline} than labor: \"Amusement [[under late
**capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark} is the prolongation of work (\...)
[mechanization has]{.underline} such [power over]{.underline} a man\'s
[leisure and happiness]{.underline}, and so profoundly determines the
manufacture of amusement goods, that his experiences are inevitably
afterimages of the work process itself.\" (Adorno and Horheimer, p.
137). [[Proceduralism]{.underline}]{.mark}, with its call for systems at
the core of the essence of games [and its **disregard** for expressive
or ineffective play, [turns]{.mark} the act of [playing]{.mark} a game
[into]{.mark} a **[labor]{.mark}-like action**, into work [towards an
**externally**]{.mark} **decided**, **[predetermined]{.mark}**, and
**rational [outcome]{.mark}** [designed by **others**]{.mark} **than the
players**]{.underline}. Play becomes [external to the player and the
play context]{.underline}.

In this sense, **[simulation fever]{.underline}**, which is supposed to
be the argument proceduralists use to justify the ambiguities brought by
players, [is nothing but the guided process of meaning-making in which a
player, reconstructing the system as designed by an author, engages with
when playing a game for other means than play]{.underline}. Again, this
is a situation that echoes those Horkheimer and Adorno critiqued: \"[No
independent thinking must be expected from the audience]{.underline}:
the product prescribes every reaction: not by its natural structure
(which collapses under reflection), but by signals. Any logical
connection calling for mental effort is painstaikingly avoided. As far
as possible, developments must follow from the immediately preceding
situation and never from the idea of the whole\" (ibid, p. 137).

But perhaps the most important element that defines instrumental play is
how [designers adopt the idea of a systems-centered game
ontology]{.underline} in order [to rationalize not only the design of
the game, but also its outcome. It is]{.underline} almost [as if
proceduralists were designing against play]{.underline}, something that
resonates with Horkheimer and Adorno's critique: \"\[\...\] the
prevalent ethos is suspicious of anything which is miscellaneous, or
heterogeneous, of anything which has not clearly and unambiguously been
assigned to its place\" (p. 190). [[Play is]{.mark} **the unknown** and
**the [uncontrollable]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} by building an
ontology based on designer-centric reason, the [[proceduralists
eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} the myth and the ritual from [[**play**,
and encourage]{.mark} an **[instrumental]{.mark} approach to
[games]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is [[exclusively guided
by]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**rules**, **norms** and
**processes**]{.mark} embedded in the game system]{.underline}.

#### [Structural Unfairness Outweighs]{.underline} Procedure. 

**SIUE 17**, Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Fall 2017, "The
Myth of Fairness and Racism,"
https://www.siue.edu/newsletters/sociology/2017/fall/MythFairness.shtml

The reason I\'m asking us to think about fairness is that I hear [**a
lot of [White people]{.mark}** [justify]{.mark} **their [racist
acts]{.mark}** [using]{.mark} the term **[\"fairness.\"]{.mark}** I\'ll
hear something like, \"]{.underline}Well, [I have to treat everyone the
same and I can\'t apply the rules differently for White]{.underline} Her
[and Black]{.underline} Her.\" Well, I am really sorry to tell you this,
truly, because this is hard to hear\...\...[you already are applying the
rules differently for White]{.underline} Her [and Black]{.underline}
Her. It\'s just that the [White]{.underline} Hers [have been the
beneficiaries]{.underline}. We may deny, ignore or not wish it so\...but
if you\'re human, then [**your [cognitive limitations]{.mark}** [leave
you]{.mark} **biased** and **[prejudiced]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [if
you\'re White, you\'re more likely to be in a position to **act on your
[biases]{.mark} to [create harm]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I\'m including
myself here, of course, because I\'m human.

Supreme Court Justice Douglass once said, \"At the constitutional level
where we work, 90% of any decision is emotional. The rational part of us
supplies the reason for supporting our predilections.\" So Douglass is
admitting that the highest court in the land \-\-- the place where if
fairness is going to happen, it\'s going to happen there \-\--makes most
decisions based on emotion, not rationality.

Max Weber called the process of justifying our emotional decisions
rational-legal legitimation. And because we don\'t want to believe
we\'re biased, we tend to use that legitimation a lot. Using the
language of rational-legal discourse, discourse like [\"I\'m **just
[following]{.mark} the [rules]{.mark}**[,\" **doesn\'t mean we\'re
fair**]{.mark}]{.underline} though.

Second, [even if we could magically rid ourselves of all cognitive
limitations, **fairness**]{.underline} today would still be
[**impossible** [because of **historical
discrimination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the sake of argument, let\'s
pretend for a moment that we can overcome our cognitive limitations such
that everyone could be neutral. Poof! There\'s objectivity as far as the
eye can see. Well, what do we do about [the [**legacy** of
racism]{.mark} that has [left **Blacks**]{.mark}, **Native Americans**,
**Asians** and **Latinos** [without the **same resources as
Whites**]{.mark}]{.underline}? When I say resources, I\'m not only
talking about wealth, income, and the like. I\'m also talking about
access to health and mental care, environmentally safe housing, and
quality education, to name a few. As a teacher or a boss or whoever has
power, I might say, \"Well, because of the Poof I have no cognitive
limitations or bias and I know how to apply rules fairly now so I have
to treat White Him and Black Him the same.\" The problem is that the
person in power has to deny that [the [White]{.mark}]{.underline} Him
[is more [likely]{.mark} to [have]{.mark} had **[more]{.mark}
resources** [his **whole life**]{.mark}, more access to **wealth**, more
access to **education**, more access to **health care**, more access to
**networking opportunities**, just more access]{.underline}.

Here\'s a hypothetical. Let\'s say your parents, who are billion-dollar
business owners, always liked your sibling better than you. To that
sibling, your parents gave housing, private schooling, tutoring when
needed, doctors, a free college education, trips to Europe, and an extra
lump of money. To you, your parents gave bupkis (that\'s nothing in
Yiddish). They made you live in a poopy little apartment and you went to
a crappy school, no tutoring if you were struggling. Broken arms? Ha!
You had to mend that yourself and instead of college education, you got
asked to leave the rental property they made you pay for. You\'re broke,
without cultural and material resources and with little prospects. Then,
all of sudden, your parents say, \"You know what? We feel sad and
bothered that we treated you two so differently. So, we\'re going to
give each of you the same opportunity to inherit and run our thriving
billion dollar business. Since we\'re giving each of you the same
opportunity to show us how adept you are at running the business, what
we\'re doing is completely fair and just and we can die knowing how
equitable we are.\" Are they right? Are things now fair? Only if we can
pretend that it means nothing that one sibling had earlier access to
tremendous opportunity while the other did not. If we admit that
resources matter, we can acknowledge that the liked sibling will be
better able to show adeptness than the disliked sibling. The difference
between this hypothetical and reality is that racism has created
generations of inequity, not just one familial situation

In sum, here\'s the dilemma: How can we begin being fair if the past is
filled with unfairness? **[The only way to ensure
fairness]{.underline}**, if suddenly we lived in a world with no
cognitive limitations, [is to make sure [everyone **begins**]{.mark}
**with [the]{.mark} exact [same]{.mark}**. That [seems
**unlikely**]{.mark} **to happen**]{.underline}.

So if I\'ve managed to convince you that fairness is impossible, you may
be wondering, \"Gosh, is it all gloom and doom? Is there any good news
in this?\" The answer is, YES, there is good news. But the bad news is
that the good news is going to be uncomfortable.

The good news is that we as a [society can]{.underline} grow and [thrive
if we]{.underline}\'re willing to [acknowledge]{.underline} that
**[[fairness is impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Before we go on, take that in a little \-- \"fairness is impossible.\"
If we\'re really honest with ourselves, when we\'re willing to admit
that we can\'t be fair, we\'re going to feel uncomfortable. Real
uncomfortable. So while it sounds easy, admitting that we can never be
fair is really quite profound.

But, once we admit that our cognitive limitations mean that we can never
be neutral or just, then we can start making accommodations for our
bias. And [one simplistic accommodation is surrounding ourselves with
people **who think differently from us** and who\'ve had different
experiences than us]{.underline}. For people in power [**that\'s
tough**. We like to surround ourselves with **people who agree with
us**. It\'s **uncomfortable** to hear]{.underline} that [maybe our
**[rules aren\'t fair to everyone]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that the
[[norms]{.mark} might [benefit **one group over
another**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that [the system is **stacked against
some groups**]{.underline}.

#### Tag -- Competition doesn't overdetermine debate

Teamwork

A crucial underlying theme throughout this discussion is the belief that
teaching should help students develop skills they will use as members of
communities for the betterment of a more just society. These skills
include the "capacity to work collectively to create a better world,"
how to "use critical reflection to analyze social problems and
policies," citizens who "are always concerned with the welfare of others
and work to promote the common good" (Hytten & Bettez, p. 19). Working
collectively to promote the common good requires teamwork. [Students
participating in debates learn how to work as a team in a context that
is uniquely connected with creating a better world via critical
examination of social problems and policies. [A common
misunderstanding]{.mark}]{.underline} by outsiders [when evaluating
competitive activities [is to assume]{.mark} that [competition breeds
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} -- i.e., that debate participation teaches
bad habits for interpersonal and organizational communication. [Critics
opine that the conflict-based format of competitive debate is inferior
to alternatives that emphasize cooperation]{.underline} (Eillis &
Hovagimian). [However, when analyzed by scholars with extensive
experience coaching]{.underline} both kinds of activities, [their
conclusion is that "clash-oriented debates" is superior to
"civility-minded dialectic" alternatives]{.underline} as "an effective
means of engaging students in the details of policy work and that it
encourages creative thinking about problems and solutions in a context
where debaters are encouraged to frankly discuss and interrogate
information" (Janas, p. 61). [[The competitive format generates greater
motivation]{.mark} for deep learning and encourages more rigorous
learning practices than mere 'discussion' achieves.]{.underline} While
it is true that in the heat of a debate students may view their opponent
in an intense adversarial manner, [myopically evaluating]{.underline}
this possible outcome of [a competitive atmosphere ignores the
cooperative nature inherent in the team component of competitive
academic debate]{.underline}. "Many interpersonal teamwork skills, such
as establishing linkages (communication, trust, etc.) with other team
members, participating in collective activities of the team, and
exercising leadership can be acquired and refined through the learning
experiences of academic debate" (Omelicheva, p. 8). [When students
debate, they compete as a team]{.underline} (either two or three people
working together). The selection of teammates can either be done by the
students, made by the teacher, or determined by some combination of the
two parties input. The teamwork required for success is multilayered.
First, there are the structural issues. "At all stages of debate,
students have to establish and maintain rapport and constructive
dialogue with other team members" (Omelicheva, p. 8). Depending on the
format employed, different debate speeches come with different
responsibilities (e.g., constructive vs. rebuttal) and the debaters have
to decide prior to the debate who will do which speeches and what
arguments they expect to make, being sure to 'divide the labor'
strategically. Second are the communication issues. Debates are dynamic,
rarely going exactly as planned, which creates stressful extemporaneous
moments when teammates must quickly decide how to adjust their strategy,
thinking with one mind and speaking with one voice. [To win debates,
"students must be able to negotiate their differences and commitments"
as a team]{.underline} (Omelicheva, p. 8). Like musicians in an
orchestra, [debaters must not only master their craft individually but
also learn to work in concert with their teammates for true success to
be achieved.]{.underline} "When students work out ideas together and
prepare to debate, they can create a kind of synergy that enhances this
process" (Snider & Schnurer, p. 162). In all of these ways, [competitive
academic debate requires students to work well with others, learn to
compromise for the greater good, and improve their interpersonal
communication skills.]{.underline}

### AT: Fairness Paradox\-\--1AR

#### [Reverse Fairness Paradox]{.underline}\-\--Labelling fairness an intrinsic good [shield]{.underline} any criticism of procedural rules\-\--forcing debaters to rely on those same restrictive norms to prove the validity of their arguments

DJDubb

[The second]{.underline}, related [issue is]{.underline} the
**[[proceduralism]{.underline}]{.mark}** of most accounts of dialogue:
the characterization of dialogue [in terms of a particular [set]{.mark}
of **communicative [norms]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the response, [when
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} or friction [[arises]{.mark}, that the
[resolution]{.mark}]{.underline} of these can (and [should) [take place
through]{.mark} a **reinvigorated application** of **[those same
norms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is clear from Ellsworth's critique that
[[this **shields from questioning**]{.mark} **or criticism** those
[norms]{.mark} themselves]{.underline}. Yet here [we encounter [a
**paradox**]{.mark}]{.underline} (the first of several to follow), one
that begins to turn the discussion of dialogue into a different, more
productive theoretical vein. [For if [questioning]{.mark} the
**[restrictive norms]{.mark}** of dialogue [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
regarded as a [[good]{.underline}]{.mark} thing, [is it not]{.underline}
at least in part [[so that]{.mark} a fuller, **[fairer]{.mark}, more
inclusive [dialogue]{.mark}** [might be]{.mark} made
[possible]{.mark}?]{.underline} If persons choose to withdraw from a
dialogue with those who do not or cannot understand them, is it not in
part so that they are able to enter a dialogue with others who can
understand them? If "analytic dialogue" seeks (rightly, I would say) to
uncover the nonneutral, historically specific conditions under which its
own interpretations proceed, is this not so that others might come to
share the same understanding, at least in part, about these conditions?
It seems strange indeed to imagine a dialogue in which every
understanding emerges as entirely idiosyncratic and separate from every
other or one that is so persistently pulling up the roots of its own
genealogy that the participants never talk about the topic at hand.

### AT: Clash\-\--2AC

#### Clash is disciplinary boundary drawing exercise that codifies racial epistemic exclusions

DJDubb

In the context of academia, our theory of [**[epistemic exclusion
asserts]{.mark}**]{.underline} that two types of
**[bias]{.underline}**---[disciplinary and
identity-based]{.underline}---shape who is perceived as a legitimate
knower [**and that** these **[biases are]{.mark}**]{.underline} deeply
embedded in seemingly [**[objective]{.mark}** and **neutral [performance
standards]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Figure 1). [Performance
standards---explicit or implicit **[criteria]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
establish what is [[**required for** positive
**evaluations**]{.underline}]{.mark}---often [**[reflect]{.mark}
disciplinary [norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} and values
[**[about]{.mark}** the qualities of ["**good"
scholarship**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[that in turn define
[certain research as "rigorous]{.mark}"]{.underline} and "mainstream"
(Gonzales, 2018). For instance, in disciplines that emphasize both
positivist and postpositivist epistemologies, like psychology (Eagly &
Riger, 2014), rigorous research is often characterized as objective,
generalizable, and value-free (Kuhn, 1962; Popper, 1959; Titchener,
1916); [this]{.underline} tends to [**[devalue researchers]{.mark}**
operating from epistemological stances **[informed by social
context]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., social constructivism) or using
critical approaches (e.g., intersectionality).

We note that the specific scholarly qualities that are incentivized and
rewarded vary across disciplines, which are distinguished from each
other by their boundaries. Gieryn (1983) articulated the concept of
["**[boundary work]{.mark}**]{.underline}" by which disciplines
**[[define]{.underline}]{.mark}** their [knowledge
**domains,**]{.underline} methodologies, [**and** scholarly
**norms.**]{.underline} That is, [**boundary work** involves "the
codification of [ideological]{.mark}]{.underline} [[commitments and best
practices]{.mark} that **mark the limits [of what counts]{.mark}** [as
inside]{.mark}]{.underline} the discipline, [**[and]{.mark} what [is
relegated outside]{.mark}** of it"]{.underline} (Grzanka & Cole, 2021,
p. 1336). Boundary work is a critical part of maintaining the identity
and autonomy of a discipline, in which
**[[gatekeepers]{.underline}]{.mark}** may seek to bar entry to those
who lack the necessary capabilities, [**[determine]{.mark}** what
**[knowledge]{.mark}** has **[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} within
the discipline, [**or exclude scholarship** that does not]{.underline}
meet assessments of quality (Elpers & FitzGerald, 2013). It is important
to keep in mind, though, that disciplines are social constructions, and
the boundary work required to maintain them is contingent and varies as
the disciplinary contexts, topics, methods, and members change. For
example, scholars (e.g., Eagly & Riger, 2014; Kuhn, 1962) have noted the
ways in which definitions of rigorous scholarly work become "invisible
and taken-forgranted" over time despite reflecting "historical and
sociocultural decisions" (Settles et al., 2020, p. 806). Psychology
offers an illustration of this, with researchers beginning to favor
quantitative methods over qualitative ones in the mid-1900s due to the
prominence of behaviorism (Wertz, 2014).

One challenge of boundary work that contributes to the variability in
valued scholarly qualities is the need to negotiate pressures to expand
versus reinforce disciplinary boundaries (Fini et al., 2023).
Disciplines "are in a constant state of struggle between established and
emerging actors who compete for symbolic distinction based on subjective
rules of merit, and the vested interests and social objectives these
rules embody" (Cattani et al., 2014, p. 258). Cattani et al. (2014)
further noted that individuals at the core of a discipline, in
particular [[established **individuals**]{.mark} **who have** acquired
**power and privilege**]{.underline}, tend to [**[reinforce]{.mark}**
existing **[boundaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., **[by recognizing
work within the boundaries with awards]{.underline}**). In contrast,
individuals at the periphery of a discipline, emerging scholars who seek
to innovate or challenge the status quo, tend to expand the disciplinary
boundaries. **[[When those who]{.underline}]{.mark}** seek to
[[**expand** the **boundaries**]{.underline}]{.mark} of a discipline
[**[are]{.mark}** members **of [marginalized]{.mark} groups**, [the
**reinforcement of norms**]{.mark}]{.underline} by those at the
disciplinary center may [**[reflect racism]{.mark}** and other forms of
oppression]{.underline}, like sexism.

Our theory of epistemic exclusion conceptualizes unwarranted
disciplinary bias as occurring when those seeking to expand or shift the
boundaries of a discipline and/or those working outside the status quo
are devalued, despite contributing meaningfully to the field. An example
would be if a faculty member in psychology was hired for their
innovative scholarly work on racially minoritized populations, but then
that scholarship was devalued in evaluations because it is published in
"lower impact" race-focused psychology journals or uses novel methods
(e.g., communitybased participatory action research). We are not
suggesting that every scholarly norm produces epistemic exclusion, but
rather some norms reflect disciplinary biases that do not represent
quality and may lead to unwarranted exclusions. Disciplinary bias would
not be in play if the exclusion is warranted, that is, the scholarly
work is evaluated as poor quality or squarely outside the discipline by
those who are well placed to make that determination (e.g., scholars in
the same subfield).

There is a growing body of evidence regarding disciplinary biases within
psychology. For example, Eagly and Riger (2014) found that from 2004 to
2012, only 8.7% of journal articles used qualitative methods, and
Roberts et al. (2020) found that between 1974 and 2018, only 5% of
journal articles published in prestigious journals within cognitive,
developmental, and social psychology highlighted race. Settles et al.
(2020) found that from 2004 to 2019, only 2.9% of articles using the
critical theory of intersectionality were published in the 30 psychology
journals with the highest impact factors. Moreover, E. B. King et al.
(2018) found that diversity-focused articles compared to
non-diversity-focused articles submitted to the Journal of Management
over a 7 year period were "12 times more likely to be rejected than
accepted and 15 times more likely to be offered a revision than
accepted" in earlier rounds of review (p. 848). The authors note that
based on this archival data and additional experimental data,
diversity-focused research in industrial-- organizational psychology is
held to stricter standards in the journal review process (E. B. King et
al., 2018). Thus, data indicate that certain types of scholarship are
excluded from the field's publications, not because of their poor
quality or incongruency with the discipline but due to their method,
topic, theoretical lens, or population.

These disciplinary biases about the [**[boundaries of "good"
scholarship]{.mark}** are coupled with identity-based biases that
**[challenge the credibility of]{.mark}** scholars from **[marginalized
groups]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For example, research in the United
States has documented the presence of negative stereotypes of Asian
people as perpetual foreigners and lacking warmth (Fiske et al., 1999;
Sue, 2010). Negative stereotypes of Black, Latinx, and Native American
people portray them as lazy, lacking intelligence, and beneficiaries of
unearned advantages (Ghavami & Peplau, 2013); women are also stereotyped
as lacking intelligence and competence (Heilman, 2001). Echoing the
tenets of Black feminist epistemology (Collins, 2000), the intersection
of negative stereotypes about women of color's race and gender (Cole,
2009; D. K. King, 1988; Settles & Buchanan, 2014) may make them
especially vulnerable to negative stereotyping.

We posit that stereotypes and [**[identity-based biases]{.mark}**
are]{.underline} typically [not made explicit, but]{.underline} rather
these biases are [**[camouflaged by negative evaluations]{.mark}** of
the scholar's work]{.underline}. That is, **[individuals doing the
excluding]{.underline}** do not need to attribute their scholarly
devaluation to the identity of the targeted scholar (e.g., a person of
color), but instead can [**express** disciplinary **biases
against**]{.underline} the types of scholarship those individuals are
more likely to engage in, such as **[scholarship centered on
marginalized groups]{.underline}** (e.g., Gonzales, 2018). [**This**
process **allows epistemic exclusion**]{.underline} to
disproportionately target scholars from marginalized groups [**while
being attributed to** disciplinary **norms about** what defines
**high-quality and impactful scholarship.**]{.underline}

### Root Cause/Thesis\-\--2AC

#### Racial capitalism originates in the settler-colonial reversal of dependence on Indigenous and Black earth-worlds---through the invention of race and the society--nature dualism, European colonizers obscure their reliance on racialized modes of ecological co-production, reframe them as inert "nature," and justify genocidal appropriation. This ontological project enables both the productive power and ecological exhaustion of capital by turning co-constituted life-worlds into extractable resources, positioning race as foundational to capitalism's structure---not derivative.

[[Rendering **race**]{.mark} **as [derivative of capitalism]{.mark}**
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [**[obscuring]{.mark}** the
**[significance]{.mark} of racialization** to both **capitalism's
productive power** and **its ecological exhaustion**]{.underline}.
Engaging the racial capitalism framework, with its premise of race as a
constituting condition of possibility for the emergence of capitalism
(Bhandar, 2018; Burden-Stelly, 2020; Robinson, 2000), accords a more
foundational significance to race as a structuring relation of power
driving planetary ecological crises. A recent article by Charisse
Burden-Stelly (2020) has clarified how [[**race** is]{.mark} the
necessary **[generative]{.mark} premise** for a category [of
**labour**]{.mark} that is **distinctly subject to
['superexploitation']{.mark}** and]{.underline} which has, thus,
[[operated as]{.mark} an **essential [condition]{.mark} of possibility**
[for **capital accumulation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This article builds
from such an emphasis on race as foundational to capitalism, but shifts
attention from the capital--labour contradiction to a consideration of
the constitutive role played by race in **[the [capital--nature
contradiction]{.mark}]{.underline}** (O'Connor, 1998). The particular
concern will be to [[demonstrate how race
underwrites]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than derives from, [the
**Cartesian [society--nature dualism]{.mark}** [fueling]{.mark} both
**the excess** and **exhaustion** of **[capital
accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This objective will be approached through an engagement with an
underexplored premise of [Cedric Robinson's]{.underline} (2000: 74--100)
[original articulation of]{.underline} the **[[racial
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** framework in Black Marxism -- what I
would characterize [as the reversal of dependence]{.underline}. This
premise, which I read as an integral point of departure for the
unfolding of racial capitalism, [[begins]{.underline}]{.mark} not
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} an assumption of achieved colonial conquest,
but rather by [[locating **Euro**]{.mark}**-Western [subjects]{.mark}**
in an originary **peripheral relation of [dependence]{.mark}**
[upon]{.mark} the **['Other']{.mark} worlds** [of **Africans** and
**Indigenous Americans**]{.mark}. **Race**,]{.underline} as an
ontological condition of possibility for capitalism,
[emerges]{.underline} in significant part [as a material-conceptual
project centred upon]{.underline} overcoming, and indeed [**reversing**,
these originary **relations of dependence**]{.underline}. This article
further explores how race consolidates such a reversal [by
opening]{.underline} material-conceptual [space]{.underline} (Sluyter,
2001) [for the articulation of the distinctive [**society--nature
dualism** underly]{.mark}ing [**capitalism's productive power** and
**ecological exhaustion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The account offered here of the 'political ecology of racial capitalism'
will thus begin from within the socio-ecological space of the contact
zone (Pratt, 1991) that exceeds the space-time of conquest in so much as
its originary constitution is marked by the dependence of Euro-Western
survival upon 'earth-worlds' forged by Indigenous and Black peoples. In
centering both Indigenous and Black contestations with an emergent
Euro-Western settler-master, I am following Sylvia Wynter's (2003)
'coloniality of being' framework that foregrounds how [the **racialized
ontology of capitalism** emerges and functions through]{.underline}
relational, yet distinctive, [**['society-nature' forms]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} both [[locate **Indigenous people**]{.mark} as
**[closer to nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} so as [[to enable]{.mark} the
[**usurpation of sovereignty** and transmute **Black peoples** into
**'bodies' of nature** to be]{.mark} **exhaustively [exploited]{.mark}**
[under]{.mark} **conditions of [enslavement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I
aim to build on Wynter's framework by demonstrating how such distinctive
co-productions of race and the society/nature dualism are generated from
an emergent settler-master's attempted 'reversal of dependence' on
Indigenous and Black earth-worlds. The earth-world signifies here the
co-productive relationship between Indigenous and Black worlding, in the
form of socio-ecological practice and knowledge, and non-human
earth-system properties such as soil fertility and mineral deposits. It
is out of these earth-worlding capacities, this article suggests, that
the contact zones were opened as life-provisioning gifts enabling the
survival of late arriving European peoples.

The concept of the gift, while significant to the argument of this
article, should not be taken to suggest that sovereignty over land and
control over labour were freely 'gifted' to an emergent Euro-Western
settler. Rather, it stands here as confirmation, and not negation, of
Indigenous and Black sovereignty over earth-worlds that were co-produced
through their distinctive socio-ecological capacities. [The
**[dependence]{.mark} of the Euro-Western self** [upon]{.mark} the
**earth-worlding gifts of [the other]{.mark}**
[generates]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [an **affective disposition of
[vulnerability]{.mark}** [which]{.mark}]{.underline}, though being the
condition of love in other contexts (Butler, 2004; Maldonado-Torres,
2008), [comes]{.underline} here [to [motivate]{.mark} a
**[hate-based]{.mark} project** of [**mastery** and
**supremacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mendoza, 2006) [[that seeks to
**reverse**]{.mark} **the original relations of [dependence]{.mark}**
[by]{.mark} simultaneously [**appropriating** the **other's**]{.mark}
**earth-[world]{.mark}** [while **eliminating**]{.mark} the **underlying
earth-[worlding capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is thus the emergent
settler-master's refusal to recognize and, hence, reciprocate the 'gift'
-- how its own world-making capacity in the contact zone is dependent
upon the originary earth-worlding capacity of Indigenous and Black
peoples -- that enables it, through a logic of genocidal conquest,
rather than gift, to claim exclusive sovereignty over the contact zone.
In refusing to reciprocate the gift, the settler-master forecloses the
possibility of mutual love and co-existence of multiple co-constituting
worlds.

Informed by a desire to overcome its dependence upon Indigenous and
Black earth-worlds, an emergent settler-master articulates [[a
**'by-nature' racialized distinction** between **the**]{.mark}
**rational [human]{.mark}** -- **the settler-master** -- [and **the
irrational**]{.mark} **Indigenous and Black
[other]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wynter, 2003: 296--304). This racialized
distinction further opens space for the conceptual reformation of the
Indigenous and Black earth-worlds of the contact zone into lands and
bodies given by 'non-human' geological and biological forces. Such a
transmutation functions to conceal the underlying reproductive
conditions -- Indigenous and Black earth-worlding capacity -- of that
which is now marked as nature/Earth. It [[is]{.mark}, then, **the
[racialized production of nature]{.mark}** [that
accounts]{.mark}]{.underline}, ultimately, [[for]{.mark} both **the
[excess]{.mark}** [(from **appropriation**]{.mark} of **Indigenous and
Black earth-worlds**) [and **exhaustion** (from **erasure**]{.mark} of
their **constituting conditions**) of the political ecology [of **racial
capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This argument is being made on a world-historical scale in so much as it
presents the political ecology of racial capitalism, and its specific
emergence and reproduction through the appropriation and erasure of
Indigenous and Black earth-worlds, as a key structure and logic of power
generating contemporary planetary ecological crises. The article will,
as such, proceed first through an elaboration of a theoretical framework
that foregrounds the centrality of race to capitalism's society--nature
distinction. It will then turn to apply- ing this framework to an
historical examination of the processes of world-scale primitive
accumulation held to be foundational to the emergence of capitalism's
qualitative rela- tions of capital--labour and society--nature. Here, I
will focus in particular on re-considering how [the **founding
[plantations]{.mark}** [and **mines**]{.mark} **of capitalism** [emerged
through]{.mark} the **racialized [appropriation]{.mark}** [and
**erasure**]{.mark} **of earth-worlds** located [in **the
Caribbean**]{.mark} (Ayiti), **the [Andes]{.mark}** (Huacas of
Tawantinsuyu), [and **West Africa**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The article
will conclude by briefly demonstrating how such [a **structure of
[racialized appropriation]{.mark} of 'nature'** has [informed]{.mark}
the **productive power** and **ecological exhaustion of
[capital]{.mark}** across its successive historical cycles of
accumulation]{.underline}.

#### Slavery and Indigenous genocide are not rooted in capitalism but in geology---understood as an extractive technology of matter and desire. Long before capitalist logics of labor or surplus, geological hunger for gold, silver, and mineral energy drove racial classification and the violent mobilization of Black and Native bodies. Race was enfolded into geologic regimes that treated flesh as energy, weaponizing the earth's materiality against colonized peoples. Extraction, not economy, is the primal logic---rendering Black and Indigenous life as geochemical fuel in the service of white world-making.

[[It **might be easier** to]{.underline}]{.mark} contend that race is
not a "problem" of geology but a problem of humanism and its exclusions;
[[**blame the master**, **not**]{.mark} **the [tools]{.mark}**[. But
**geology** is]{.mark} **more than a tool**; it is [a **technology of
matter**]{.mark}]{.underline}, its formulation
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**desire** that
**shapes**]{.underline}]{.mark} its incarnation. Initiating [the
**Atlantic [slave trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the protocapitalist
moment of 1441, [the **first [slaves]{.mark}** sold]{.underline} in
Lisbon, Portugal, [[were **conceived**]{.mark} **of as slaves**
[within]{.mark} the **"problem" of [mining]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
Brazil: the perceived difficulties of indigenous labor (given that 90
percent of the population was wiped out due to violence and disease)
[[and]{.mark} **the [properties]{.mark}** that were **[imagined]{.mark}
to reside [in black flesh]{.mark}** on the Gold Coast]{.underline}. This
act establishes the first color line of White Geology. The solution of
race becomes enfolded in geology as a material technology of extraction,
and [the **semiotics of [race]{.mark}** [become inscripted in
**geological modes of classification** as]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[matter]{.underline}]{.mark}** relation. [Often the analysis for
slavery begins with]{.underline} the question of
**[labor]{.underline}**, which makes sense, up until a point, [but there
is a **[desire]{.mark}**]{.underline} that launches that point into
existence, [that **[prompts]{.mark} the [question]{.mark}**, of **[labor
for what?]{.mark}** At this point, we arrive at the **explanation** of
**the plantations**, the **sugar in the bowl**, and the **cotton that
needed picking**, but **[before]{.mark} these [precapitalist
economies]{.mark}** there was the **gold, silver, and copper
[mining]{.mark}** that [mobilized]{.mark} the **[hunger for]{.mark} the
[slavery]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and later, the sugar, that fueled the
English working classes of the Industrial Revolution in their extraction
of coal (see Mintz 1985). As Césaire (\[1956\] 1969, 61) writes, "we are
walking compost hideously promising tender cane and silky cotton." In
the nonconsensual collaboration with inhuman materiality as both a
property of energy and in concert with other energy sources (sugar,
coal, mineral), [[**slavery** weaponized]{.mark} the **redistribution of
[energy]{.mark}** around the globe [through]{.mark} the **flesh of
[black bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The movement of energy between enslaved bodies in plantations, plants,
long-dead fossilized plants, and industrialized labor is a geochemical
equation of extraction in the conversion of surplus. But this racialized
equation of energy is located in a larger field of production and
semiotics of extraction. [[Slavery is **not a by-product of
this**]{.mark} **process**; rather, [**slavery** is **driven**
by]{.mark} an **indifferent [extractive geo-logic]{.mark}** that is
[motivated by]{.mark} the [desire for **inhuman properties**]{.mark}.
**Indigenous [genocide]{.mark}** [and **settler colonialism** are
also]{.mark} part of these **extractive
[geo-logics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this sense, slavery can be seen
not as a confusion of subject--object in relation to inhuman
categorization but as a total submission to the principle of extraction
that was exacted through inhuman differentiation---"transformed from the
human subject of his own culture into the inhuman object of the European
culture" (Wynter, n.d., 10, emphasis original). [The [**energy regimes**
that structure]{.mark} **material [extraction]{.mark}** [were forced
into **black**]{.mark} **material and psychic [life]{.mark}**---of
**[being energy for others]{.mark}**]{.underline}, of putting sugar in
the bowl, and in the muscles of white labor; [as [an **"object" of
geochemical energy**]{.mark} and]{.underline} the rationalization of the
black body; [as **energetic pleasure**]{.underline} in all its myriad
forms [[that render]{.mark} the **"open and absolute
[vulnerability"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sexton 2010, 44) [[of **black
and brown bodies**]{.mark} to **white extraction regimes**]{.underline}.
This intervention is the beginning of asking about the process by which
such exchanges become possible.

NF: Much of your discussion of capitalism in Who Would You Kill to Save
the World focuses on '[hyper-consumption']{.underline}. The mode of
production [is largely identified with slavery or its postcolonial
effects]{.underline}. What about the capitalist exploitation of waged
labour, however imbricated with colonial and indeed modern slavery, that
is paying people less than the value of their work and appropriating the
surplus for the 1 per cent? Given the consequent extent of global
poverty, including in developed countries such as the UK, where a
quarter of children now live in poverty, is it more reasonable to
identify consumerism as an ideology and hyper-consumption as a practice
reserved for those who can afford it?

CC: Yes!! I think living and working in the USA made me more aware of
systemic racism and anti-blackness than I ever had been before moving
here. What also became apparent while living through the 2020 election
was the way in which anti-blackness was used to deflect attention away
from capitalist violence. It's not possible to reduce racism to
capitalism, but [it is necessary to see the different ways in which
racism enables ongoing wage inequity]{.underline}. James Baldwin was
neither the first nor the last to note that '[whiteness' is not a
cultural commonality, but what poorly paid workers were given in order
to secure a sense of non-exploitation]{.underline}. What Baldwin adds to
that is the way in which [the cultural emptiness of whiteness creates a
dependency on capitalist exploitation. It also creates a form of
identity defined through aspirations to hyper-consumption, and this is
crucial to global poverty]{.underline}. Even if, as you correctly note,
hyper-consumption is enjoyed by the few, it nevertheless becomes the
only means of self-formation globally. [There's an idea that 'we' all
end up with smartphones and laptops and cars, even though that idea is
only possible if there are forms of wage exploitation that make such
aspirations impossible. And those wage differentials are highly
racialised, both historically (with capitalism being built on slavery)
and structurally -- with anti-blackness directing political energy away
from wage inequity, and with wage inequity itself being intensified for
persons of colour.]{.underline}

### Link Turn\-\--2AC

#### The concept of "labor" cannot account for Black captivity---convict leasing and carceral mining were not labor but geophysical extraction rooted in Black fungibility. Liberal labor metaphysics presumes agency, personhood, and subjectivity---conditions systematically denied to the Black body, which was rendered as raw spatial material for settler accumulation. Appeals to labor obscure how racial capitalism operates by transforming Blackness into a non-human medium of value production, spatial regulation, and social death. Rejecting labor as redemptive is necessary to disrupt the metaphysical grammar of accumulation and the settler's world-making project.

Fungibility Not Labor ( after King)

[The terminology of labor]{.underline} has a selective normalization
that [is inappropriate]{.underline} ([in the context of Black
incarceration]{.underline} in mines), [even as modifiers are attached to
it, such as carceral, unfree, Black, enslaved, coerced, and so forth.
The pole that these modifiers circle]{.underline}, in the New South, [is
the imaginary and ideal of white labor, which is]{.underline} in turn
[underpinned by the desire for "cheap" Black labor to do the actual
work.]{.underline} While different from slavery in its forms (legally
and ontologically), convict labor actualized some of the codes and
actions of coercion, by the Overseer (now turned industrialist), through
a range of physical and psychic economies: random and targeted violence;
petty reward systems and inducements; the promise of salvation; physical
and mental degradation.26 Normative assumptions that run along [the
liberal embrace of labor as evidence of subjective achievement and
appropriate striving have a white masculine body as center and
type]{.underline}. Any small- town coal museum will tell this story of
the commemorated white miner. [This representative norm is racially
coded into the present.]{.underline}

[Assumptions of labor as improvement are tied to the ideals of
freedom]{.underline} in the liberalist mode that Shona Jackson (2012)
calls [the "metaphysics of labor," as individualized and
humanist]{.underline}, which [consecrated in advance the Black miner as
outside that order, while offering the lure of a contradictory path to
recognition]{.underline} within that mode. Stephen Haymes argues [the
designation of labor as a category for Black work is ontologically
nonsensical: "In the antiblack world of (post)settler societies, black
labor is an oxymoron. . . . It is simply a tool in the perpetual service
and extension of white desire and its will to power]{.underline}" (2018,
44). [Black labor]{.underline}, then, [is a rifted category, where
Blackness performs dialectically in negative relation to the claim of
labor rights, functioning as the included exclusion that substantiates
the improvement of matter but from outside the full terms of the
category.]{.underline} In this equation, [mortgaged chattel]{.underline}
(in Du Bois's terms) [cannot improve matter because only labor that can
function in the category of the human can undertake
improvement.]{.underline} Both Tennessee Coal and Iron lease in 1888 and
Sloss Iron and Steel in 1893 stipulated to the state the requirement for
"productive" labor in the lessee, that is, labor that can produce beyond
the cost of "its" \[ human\] maintenance. In this formation [Black labor
is "surplus" to produce value from the earth, without the primary
capacity for the creation and accumulation of value.]{.underline}

[Fungibility becomes exercised in the total extractive logic in the
carceral mines, and raw material becomes "natural" and national resource
through the application of labor as raced. Thus, the transformation of
matter through labor is only symbolically available to whiteness as an
"originary" generator of value through geopower--- and author of the
origin story of natural resources]{.underline}--- within the geosocial
context of the lease. [The prioritizing of economics as a frame of
analysis obscures the very social and spatial function of how the
convict lease system worked collaboratively as a quiet violence in the
systematic and pathological disciplining of spatial expression through
extreme forms of Black exposure/enclosure.]{.underline} The ploy of
labor shortages after emancipation, often argued as the economic
motivation that provided a point for analysis by historians, denies the
regulatory function in social space of the lease system in the South,
while also not adequately accounting for the availability of free Black
labor (Mancini 1996, 53--54). Rather, [economic motivation and the
creation of surplus value]{.underline} (beyond that of the plantation)
without capital expenditure (save for the lease) still [does not
attend]{.underline} enough [to the]{.underline} reassertion of
[geoforces of segregation]{.underline}.27 As described by King, " [Under
slavery and conquest, the Black body becomes the ultimate symbol of
accumulation, malleability, and flux existing outside of human
coordinates of space and time]{.underline}. Rather, [Blackness is the
raw dimensionality]{.underline} (symbol, matter, kinetic energy) [used
to make space. As space, Black bodies cannot also occupy space on human
terms"]{.underline} (2016a, 1028--29).

[Blackness, after emancipation, was denied the spatial and temporal
claims of whiteness and the contours and identity of humanist
placemaking]{.underline}.28 [Thus it was rendered ontologically vagrant
in a model where place is established through hierarchies of the human
and its racialized arrivals within time]{.underline} ("You Are Here,"
arrival, property, and territory vis- à- vis "You Are Not- Here,"
nonarrival, placeness, fungible without property or territory). King's
(2016a, 1028--29) analysis of Blackness as flux and "raw dimensionality
(symbol, matter, kinetic energy) used to make space," gives a mode of
apprehension with which to transfigure the fixity of the stratal hold on
race, particularly if we understand the attachment to the placing of
Blackness as a compensatory or aspirational claim made to arrest the
flux of time as a medium of movement that claims freedom. [It might seem
perverse to dismiss the category of labor, a double erasure even, when
so much backbreaking labor was done for others' enrichment, but the
rejection of the redemptive value of labor is necessary in overcoming
the material valuation systems of racial capitalism and its subterranean
racial debt]{.underline} (made in the context of the predatory debt of
fines and the rupture of relationships [which sought to further isolate
the racialized poor from liberatory geographies]{.underline}).

The argument of wage value under slavery and the convict lease system
shows differences in the status of the enslaved and the incarcerated.29
But this form of accounting conceals more that it reveals insomuch as
neither form of enclosure can be considered as labor or even
symbolically waged, and it is erroneous to make analogies that replant
the theft of personhood in categories in which this is not recognized as
primarily an inhumane category of extraction. John DuBose's (1886)
"false theory of labor" establishes a politics of recognition that makes
a tool of utility without a corresponding understanding of the broader
implications and functioning of the system of regulating subjectivity
and space, specifically in the reactivation of a space of captivity in
the spatial margins of the underground. Inspectors too asked after the
question of carceral subjectivity, attempting to make connections
between physiology and capacities of criminality in the body of the
"convict." But these questions are simply posed in the context of the
utility of driving the incarcerated harder, and recognition is a tool of
furthering oppression and the exercise of power. The inspectors ask:

> What influence, if any, does prison life have upon the health of
> convicts? This is a big question. . . . What is a convict? . . . He is
> a citizen deprived of his personal liberty, and denied his social,
> civil, political, industrial, religious and last but not least his
> sexual privileges. All these must of necessity and actually do work to
> the detriment of bodily vigor; physical capacity and health of
> convicts and intrinsically tend to shorten life. . . . The difference
> between death rate of free miners and convicts is truly very great.
> Why this difference? Whoever answers this question, solves the prob
> lem of working convicts in coal mines. (Alabama 1886, 246--47)

[The role of labor in shaping]{.underline} questions of [political
affairs and governance can be further disrupted, if we take
on]{.underline} King's (2016a, 1022) suggestion to see ["Black
fungibility as a spatial analytic." Disposability was enacted as a
bodily condition of the fungibility of energy and its
depletion]{.underline}, and the question the inspectors pose is merely
one of extending the longevity of extraction. Thus, [labor itself is a
deeply inadequate term for this geophysical exchange and its ongoing
praxis as a pedagogy of geologic life in colonial earth. The "agency"
that labor denotes is erased]{.underline} in any meaningful sense in the
context of convict leasing [because the depletion of energy is directly
related to the increased dispersion of energy on the surface of the
earth.]{.underline} Labor under-grounds are a geophysical analytic of
race.

[While social historians have worked to show the often-vexed paths into
free labor, and the establishment of Black working-class]{.underline}
miners and artisan metallurgists [that instantiated the postbellum
actualization of the economic subject within racial capitalism, the
transition is misleading in its assumptions around a desire for and
toward an individuated liberal subject as the ideal. The rubric of labor
that imaginaries of Blackness are mobilized within has often served as a
ground to resource extraction---extraction that is tied to the elision
of the social and ecological worlds of Black place-making]{.underline}.
The agility of analysis that King brings to bear on the question of
labor expands the concept of fungibility beyond its subjective form into
a spatial theory that explicates Spillers's designation of the body as a
"territory," in which [the "Black fungible body as 'territory' becomes
linked to the space-making project of the 'New World sociopolitical
order of conquest' "]{.underline} (quoted in King 2016a, 1026). [As
settler territory is expanded, the mode of racial conversion
is]{.underline} across the stratal relation of overgrounds and
[subjugating under grounds to produce spaces for whiteness.]{.underline}
As chain gangs became a spectacle of social space, simultaneously
disciplining Black conduct and establishing racial criminalization of
the poor, the mines were at a spatial remove and below ground, involved
in the sedimentation of value. [Spatial isolation fed racial
capitalism.]{.underline}

#### Traditional political economic analysis reduces capital to a class-based social relation, overlooking its inhuman, axiomatic structure that operates through racialized spatial violence and ecological destruction. This anthropocentric framing misdiagnoses the source of planetary crisis and props up reformist politics that fail to confront capital's deeper ontological logic.

Capital as axiomatic

[In order [to understand]{.mark}]{.underline} the seeming inexorability
of [[**the Anthropocene** and]{.mark} its **devastating [racializing
effects]{.mark}**, the traditional **[Marxist]{.mark} focus of class and
political-economic [analysis]{.mark}** [seems **insufficient**]{.mark}.
Deleuze and Guattari]{.underline} (1987) nevertheless strictly follow
Marx when they [conceptualize capital as an **abstract, altogether
inhuman form of exchange**]{.underline}. For the "mature" Marx of
Capital, [the **irrational nature of [capital]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
exactly what makes it [capable of **reorganizing**]{.mark} **the
[earth]{.mark}** [in **its**]{.mark} **own [image]{.mark}**, regardless
of ideology and tradition]{.underline}. At the time of The Communist
Manifesto, Marx and Engels (2005) still identified the bourgeoisie as
the revolutionary subject of modernity, but we should reread its famous
passages as conceptualizations of capital instead:

> The bourgeoisie [\[[**capital\] cannot exist** without]{.mark}
> **constantly [revolutionising]{.mark}** the **instruments of
> production**]{.underline}, and thereby [the [**relations of
> production**, and]{.mark} with them **the whole relations of
> [society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Conservation of the old modes of
> production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first
> condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant
> revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
> conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
> bourgeois \[capitalist\] epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed,
> fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable
> prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become
> antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air,
> all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face
> with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with
> his kind.
>
> [**The [need]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a [**constantly expanding market**
> for]{.mark} its [products chases]{.mark}]{.underline} the bourgeoisie
> \[[[capital\] over **the entire**]{.mark} **surface of the
> [globe]{.mark}**[. It must]{.mark} nestle everywhere, **[settle
> everywhere]{.mark}**, **establish connexions
> everywhere**]{.underline}. (Marx and Engels, 2005: 44)

[**[Capital]{.mark}'s essence** is to **[penetrate]{.mark}**, **scoop
up**, [and **render exchangeable** **all bodies**]{.mark}, **things**,
[and **landscapes**]{.mark}, and [meanwhile **obfuscate its**]{.mark}
**own [workings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Deleuze and Guattari put
emphasis on the mysterious power of money to put a value on absolutely
anything. But they also follow Marx in insisting that capital requires
barriers in order to renew itself, an argument well-known in geography
through Harvey's work (see Harvey, 2010). Capital became the determining
factor only because it is hindered by political and traditional as well
as geophysical and physiological obstacles. There is no space here to
fully elaborate a Deleuze-- Guattarian critical-geographical framework,
but it starts by radicalizing the Marxian concept of capital and
critique of state power (Alliez and Lazzarato, 2018; Sibertin-Blanc,
2016). Against both their faddish reputation in the humanities and a
suspicion amongst Marxists, Deleuze and Guattari are far from vitalist
mystics unencumbered with geographical injustices. In fact, [the
attention]{.underline} in their work, especially A Thousand Plateaus
(1987), [to the **unsurpassable [fluidity of capital]{.mark}** in
conjunction [with]{.mark} **sexual desires**, **[racist
imagery]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or "faciality"), and [**mechanization**,
[as well as]{.mark} the]{.underline}ir **[idea of ["the
earth"]{.mark}]{.underline}** as factor in world history, can
[[entwine]{.mark} fruitfully [with]{.mark}]{.underline} feminist and
[[**decolonial discourses** and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
[**[overcome]{.mark} the tendencies** towards **philosophical
[dualism]{.mark}** [and **reductionism** which]{.mark} continue to
**[plague]{.mark}**]{.underline} the more [traditional **[Marxist
critiques]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Saldanha, 2017).

The central concept Deleuze and Guattari (1987) propose to highlight
[the **inhuman explosiveness of [capital]{.mark}** is the
"**axiomatic**." The capitalist economy **[continually invents]{.mark}
quasi-automatic [mechanisms]{.mark}** [for **profit**]{.mark}**-making**
[they call "**axioms**."]{.mark}]{.underline} Far from being in essence
linked to liberal democracy, [capitalism takes many forms]{.underline},
with authoritarian, criminal, and even state-socialist regimes all
[procuring ever-new ways of feeding the feedback loop of
money]{.underline}. Following world-systems theory (see also Arrighi,
2009), Deleuze and Guattari contend [this **[continual
reinvention]{.mark} of capital** [as it spreads explains]{.mark} the
**[geographic unevenness]{.mark} of the system**]{.underline} in which
even noncapitalism (economies without banking, crossborder trade, or
reinvestment of profits) continues to exist:

> the international capitalist axiomatic effectively assures the
> isomorphy of the diverse formations only where the domestic market is
> developing and expanding, in other words, in 'the center'. But it
> tolerates, in fact it requires, a certain peripheral polymorphy, to
> the extent that it is not saturated, to the extent that it actively
> repels its own limits; this explains the existence, at the periphery,
> of heteromorphic social formations, which certainly do not constitute
> vestiges or transitional forms since they realize an ultramodern
> capitalist production (oil, mines, plantations, industrial equipment,
> steel, chemistry), but which are nonetheless precapitalist, or
> extracapitalist, owing to other aspects of their production and to the
> forced inadequacy of their domestic market in relation to the world
> market. When international organization becomes the capitalist
> axiomatic, it continues to imply a heterogeneity of social formations,
> it gives rise to and organizes its 'Third World'. (1987: 436--437)

Capital's paradox is that it is both immensely productive and immensely
destructive of social formations and ecologies, and that it homogenizes
the world by encouraging heterogeneity. But with feminist and decolonial
critiques in mind, we should add the renown "creative destruction"
neoliberal economists elevate to quasi-divine principle has an intrinsic
racial and gender bias insofar as bosses and politicians of the core
countries make decisions that cause unemployment, war, famine,
pollution, extreme weather, and stressed households in the peripheries,
continuing the callousness of colonial days. Men in suits make decisions
about arms and mining or food and fuel prices on Wall Street and in the
City of London, but also in Hong Kong and Riyadh, driving farmers to
suicide in India and refugees to flee Yemen or East Congo. But the men
in suits must continually reinvest their profits or they risk being
outcompeted: nobody masters capital's fluidity. The institutional racism
inheres in the fact that in the process of fiercely competing with one
another, these capitalists can lay entire societies and ecosystems to
waste and justify it as bringing "development" or simply "doing
business."

Empires and wealthy merchants have been aggressively expanding their
reach for millennia. However, [thanks to its enigmatic and singularly
effective axiomatic, [**only capital** could have pursued **a**]{.mark}
**truly ["planetary" agenda]{.mark}**[. **This**]{.mark} **diffusedness
and proliferating [reliance]{.mark}** on **other forces** is exactly
what [amounts to]{.mark} **its [capacity]{.mark}** [to create a **new
phase in**]{.mark} **the evolution of the [earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Analyses of the role of capital in global environmental destruction show
the disaster-prone nature of capital is part of its normal functioning
(Angus, 2016; Foster et al., 2010; Kovel, 2007). The child soldiers,
toxic sludge, detention camps, sex tourism, ocean garbage patches, smog,
and unfinished ghost cities are the logical result of the
selfaugmentation of capital as much as the glitzier spaces of airports
and cyberspace. [All the **famous hockey-stick graphs** associated with
**the [Anthropocene]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} **ultimately
[materializations]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **the [exponential spirality of
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and even mainstream commentators are
anxious about where these compound processes are heading. [**Qua
[axiomatic capital]{.mark}** has no conscience, because it is **not
conscious**. It [is]{.mark} a **very simple [algorithmic
process]{.mark}** capitalists themselves are caught up in. [The
Anthropocene could **only emerge** because of]{.mark} **such a [runaway
process]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whereas previous transformations brought
to the planet by humans, from fire to polders, all had their geographic
limitations built into them. Though Deleuze and Guattari (1987) are in
broad agreement with Harvey's (2010) characterization of [capital
as]{.underline} the quintessential productive principle of
globalization, especially in the form of finance, their concept of
[**axiomatic** places more emphasis on capital's **uncontrollable** and
**inhuman aspects** while never losing sight of how money enlists
consumers', bankers', and politician's desires]{.underline}.

### Perm\-\--2AC

#### The rift interlaces the material and metaphoric to navigate a liberatory struggle rooted in materiality and forms of world-making. 

**Davies 25** (Archie Davies, Lecturer at the School of Geography &
Institute for the Humanities and Social Sciences, Queen Mary University
of London; 5-22-25; "Race in the Metabolic Rift: The Metaphor and
Materiality of Whiteness"; doi: 10.1111/anti.70029) -- Langham EY

Katherine McKittrick offers "rift" as a keyword for radical geography,
but she does not do so with metabolism in mind. Rather, she is thinking
of Black geographies: "**[The rift]{.underline}** must \... not just
take us somewhere new, or old, conceptually, it must [**provide the
conditions for us to think carefully about how the work of liberation is
tied to the uneasy work of getting in touch with** the **materiality**
of our analytical worlds]{.underline}" (McKittrick 2019:247). I take up
McKittrick's injunction to consider the materiality of the analytical
world of the metabolic rift. McKittrick returns to an essay by Cindi
Katz and Neil Smith on the question of metaphor in geographical thought.
In the midst of the 1990s spatial turn, they argued that "**[if a new
spatialized politics is to be both coherent and effective, it will be
necessary to comprehend the interconnectedness of material and
metaphorical space]{.underline}**" (Smith and Katz 1993:67). [This
raises an important question for]{.underline} metabolic thought: are
metabolism/metabolic rift metaphorical or material terms? Given that
they arise out of an avowedly [Marxist discourse]{.underline}, it is,
perhaps, safe to begin from the assumption [that]{.underline} these [are
materialist concepts, not intended as metaphors.]{.underline} Yet this
distinction quickly breaks down: "[the **language of space**, inside and
outside geography, must **interlace the material and the
metaphoric**]{.underline}" (McKittrick 2019:245). It is in this sense
that I explore the rift's imaginary, metaphorical, material, and literal
dimensions.

[To consider how the material and metaphoric are interlaced, it makes
sense to start from language.]{.underline} Notwithstanding some
meanderings of translation and citation (different English versions of
Marx are used in texts on metabolic rift/metabolism), [the original
language of rift is Marx's German term Riss]{.underline} (Marx and
Engels 1894). [Riss]{.underline} has roots in Middle High German and [is
a close cognate for the English "rift"]{.underline} (W€orterbuchnetz
n.d.). [In English, "rift"]{.underline} comes from Scandinavian
languages, where it [refers to clefts, chasms, and pieces that are torn
off. Rifts]{.underline}, then, [are geologic.]{.underline}

Thinking about the metabolic rift suggests a "deep time" frame which
speaks to the contemporary extent of human impacts on the planetary
system (Gandy 2018). However, [a **turn to the geologic** is not to
scientific, epistemological, or material stability, but to **a moral,
racial, and epochal process of world-making**]{.underline} (Yusoff
2024). Rift stabilises in English in the 15th century. The earliest
usage of rift referred to in the Oxford English Dictionary is in the
alliterative Middle English poem from the Pearl Manuscript, Purity
(sometimes known as Cleanness). The poem, which extols the virtue of
moral and physical cleanliness, is assumed to be by the author of Sir
Gawain and the Green Knight. In this first English usage, "rift" appears
in the midst of an account of the destruction of the cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah. Here, rifts are Satanic, and emerge directly from hell: "Þe
grete barrez of þe abyme he barst up at onez, / Þat alle þe regioun
torof in riftes ful grete" (He \[Satan/Hell\] broke open the great
barriers of the abyss at once, so that all the region tore asunder in
very great fissures).1 The context is illuminating.

### Alternative\-\--2AC

#### Nature DA\-\--Marx's distinction between first and second nature reproduces Eurocentric colonial logics that cast colonized and racialized peoples as "wild" nature, denying them full recognition as social and historical subjects.

Naturalism: A Manifesto," *Krisis: Journal for Contemporary Philosophy*,

<https://doi.org/10.21827/krisis.43.1.40995>, DJDubb

Moreover, the manifesto mentions [the Marxist/Hegelian idea that "for a
society to reproduce itself, it must satisfy the needs of its members
via a transformation of external nature."]{.underline} The problem,
though, is that it [does not account sufficiently for the fact that it
was the subjection of colonized and enslaved people which enabled the
reproduction of capitalist societies through their metonymic equivalence
with "external nature." In the same way that colonization was viewed as
the primary stage of "primitive accumulation" in Marx]{.underline} --
rather than part of the social struggle between capitalists and the
proletariat -- [the colonized seem to be left out of the Eurocentric
picture by not being part of society, or "second nature."]{.underline}
How can we account for the gendered and racialized naturalization of
unpaid work and slavery when "nature" is only seen as "external"/ "wild"
or "socialized"? When ["second nature" prevents Europeans from seeing
the colonized and enslaved as human and as possessing culture or society
(through their ontological reduction to passive extractable matter that
awaits White domination)]{.underline}, then we must ask if such
[metaphysical violence necessarily places them in the category of
"external" or "wild nature" which can only be mastered -- or worse,
saved -- through White enlightenment. This blind spot]{.underline} of
critical theory [remains urgent, especially now that the climate crisis
exacerbates neocolonial relations]{.underline} (Bhambra 2021, 80).

Despite [the manifesto's]{.underline} suggestion that critical theory
"must overcome" its "[Eurocentric bias]{.underline}," it [does not
adequately address the many metabolic rifts between humans and "nature"
(and colonizers and colonized) that already happened in Europe's
centuries-long colonial project.]{.underline} Like Kathryn Yusoff's
(2018) important insight that there have been "a billion black
anthropocenes" rather than one (the Anthropocene), [we cannot
suggest]{.underline} similarly [that there has only been one metabolic
rift that developed from Europe's industrial revolution.]{.underline} In
a similar vein, Malcolm Ferdinand (2022) suggests that [the problem of
many environmental theories is that they only focus on one
fracture]{.underline} (the metabolic rift) [instead of the double
fracture that characterizes modernity: the colonial and environmental
fracture]{.underline} (3). A combined decolonial and ecological approach
is not only crucial to fully understand the complex ways in which
historical injustices affect today's unequally distributed
vulnerabilities to climate catastrophes, health and social crises, but
it is also necessary because it urges critical theory to look beyond its
own tradition for more fruitful ways of thinking about nature. As
Gurminder Bhambra (2021) asks: "why valorize what can be presented as
'its own theoretical tradition' rather than the possibility of learning
from other traditions?" (81). Such a dialogue with other traditions
might however mean that the dialectical notions of "first" and "second
nature" and "metabolic rift" limit the manifesto's aim to "come to terms
with ourselves."

To be clear, my resignation has nothing to do with my local branch, nor

to offer but admiration, solidarity, love, and hope, both as my comrades
and my friends. [My [resignation]{.mark}]{.underline}, instead,
[[has]{.mark} everything [to do with]{.mark} the **[leadership]{.mark}**

its]{.underline} various other [**[systemic issues]{.mark}**, which I do

not be overcome**]{.mark} unless the current order radically
shifts]{.underline}. Until such time, assuming it comes, [[I **do not
feel safe**]{.mark} continuing]{.underline} my candidacy [with the
party]{.underline}. I do, however, believe that certain comrades within
the PSL, if they manage to take power within the party, have the
capacity to make the changes it needs to keep all of its members safe,
to serve the most exploited and oppressed of the masses as a capable
revolutionary party, and to survive the present tumult with which it is
faced.

To summarize, [some of these failures are **organizational** and others
**ideological**]{.underline}. Those on ideological grounds concern
primarily the chauvinism [[I have witnessed --- **white**]{.mark}
**chauvinism** and **[male chauvinism]{.mark}** --- from **several
individual members**, [which the party]{.mark} has **failed to correct**
and **tacitly [allows]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In online discourse
(remember, I am currently in Britain, physically quite far from the

would characterize as [**[racist opportunism]{.mark}** in reaction
[towards concerns]{.mark} regarding the place of national liberation,
decolonization, and reparations in the revolutionary movement [raised by
**Black**]{.mark} **and Indigenous [comrades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I
have profusely apologized several times on behalf of the party for this
disgusting, reactionary display and I have decided that [I will not hold

change. Meanwhile, [[I have]{.mark} witnessed and [been the recipient
of]{.mark} **blatant, aggressive [misogyny]{.mark}** from a few members
of the PSL and]{.underline}, worse still, [other party [members]{.mark}
have shamelessly [attempted to]{.mark} **hide** this abuse, to "delete"
it and **[sweep it under the rug]{.mark}**, rather than to confront and
put an end to it]{.underline}. Likewise, I have decided that [I will not
hold membership in any party which]{.underline} does not prioritize the
safety of women and LGBT people and which [disregards its most

A [revolution would entail **[halting capital
accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the central process of capitalism.
[The **wealth** of the capitalist class]{.underline}---those who own
most of society\'s productive resources---[would be **appropriated**,
and society\'s surplus would be **controlled collectively**]{.underline}
by either (1) the workers who produced it, (2) the community in which it
was produced, or (3) the entire society. Wealth and income caps would be
required to prevent further capital accumulation of individuals and
groups.

[**Private wealth** is protected by **property laws** and **law
enforcement**. These laws would have to be changed, which [would require
control of]{.mark} **political [institutions]{.mark}**. In]{.underline}
a democracy like [the U.S., control of these institutions can come
[through **elections** or]{.mark} by]{.underline} directly taking power,
i.e., [[a **coup**]{.mark} **d\'etat**---removing current]{.underline}
elected (and unelected) [officials]{.underline} from their positions of
power. Both cases would require a mass anti-capitalist movement.
Revolutionaries, including [**Foster** and **Malm**]{.underline}, tend
to frown upon the electoral approach, which is a longer-term reformist
approach.22 Thus, I will assume that they are in [favor]{.underline} of
[building a **mass anti-capitalist [movement]{.mark}** and **directly
taking power**. To be successful, they would [have to]{.mark} take
**[control]{.mark}** of the [**military**, which]{.mark} would
[otherwise]{.mark} **put an [end]{.mark}** to the **attempted
[revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[In the event that a revolution is successful]{.underline}, the
revolutionaries would then have to re-build the economic, political, and
legal institutions that make up organized human society. [[There would
be **counter-revolution**]{.mark} **attempts** [by]{.mark} the
**[former]{.mark} political and economic [elites]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and [their supporters, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} likely by external
forces (i.e., **[[other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [In the
U.S.]{.underline}, for example, [they would have to deal with **Wall
Street**, **Silicon Valley**, and the **74 million people** who voted
for]{.underline} Donald [**Trump** in]{.underline} the
[2020]{.underline} election. [[They]{.mark} would]{.underline} also
[[have to]{.mark} **establish relationships** with **international
trading partners** to]{.underline} ensure that they can [**sufficiently
[provide]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the **entire
[population]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, [they would have to
**implement policies** to [reduce]{.mark} **CO2
[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in line with the 1.5-2 °C warming
target, [[and]{.mark} create **[enforce]{.mark}ment mechanisms** to deal
with those who do not follow the policies, e.g., **[fossil fuel]{.mark}
producers** and **[counterrevolutionaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Given]{.mark} the **scale** and **[time]{.mark}frame** [for]{.mark}
addressing [climate change]{.mark}, the [revolution]{.mark} approach
[is]{.mark} **extremely [unlikely]{.mark}** to find
success]{.underline}. Moreover, its short-term strategy, i.e., what to
do before a revolution, is unnecessarily restrictive---it rejects all
policies that do not go against the \"logic of capital.\" Thus, like the
degrowth approach, the revolution approach would make climate
stabilization exceedingly difficult.

**[Empirical evaluation]{.underline} concludes the revolution is
[impossible]{.underline}.**

I do not, however, think that the [[revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}ary
road is implausible. Rather, it [[is
**impossible**]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least [inside]{.underline} the
[rich capitalist democracies]{.underline}. And between the implausible
and the impossible the choice is clear.

Again, [this]{.underline} can be framed as an [empirical hypothesis: You
do **not see** revolutions in **developed capitalist
democracies**]{.underline}. As Przeworski and Limongi (1997) have
written, [there has **never** been a revolution in a **moderately
middle-class democracy**]{.underline} (see also Przeworski, 2019).
[[Drawing on a **thousand years of data**]{.underline}]{.mark},
cumulatively collected [[across **37**]{.mark} **democratic
[countries]{.mark}**, they show that **[not one]{.mark}** had [collapsed
with]{.mark} a **per-capita [GDP]{.mark}** [higher
than]{.mark}]{.underline} that of [**[Argentina]{.mark}** in
1976]{.underline}. Among countries with half that figure, collapse was
exceedingly rare. Even a modest GDP brings with it an enormous amount of
regime stability. [These data]{.underline} in fact [include **any kind
of regime collapse**; **narrowing** the data to **socialist revolution**
makes the **empirical case** against it **even more
impressive**]{.underline}. Any case for revolution must begin by
acknowledging rather than ignoring this evidence.

To look at this question in a different way, I draw on the
Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive, which contains information on
revolutions (rather than government collapse) for over 200 countries
since 1919. Their definition of revolution is very broad (see footnote
7) and includes "attempts" to overthrow government as well as
"unsuccessful" rebellions. The data were compiled from newspaper sources
and warrants caution, but nonetheless constitutes the most systematic
evidence available for these questions. In Figure 9, I present the GNP
per capita distribution of revolutions, from 1919, where GNP is first
available, to the present. By considering only those country-years with
revolutions I reduce the observation count from 17,520 to 184. Unlike
Przeworski, I do not further restrict the data to democracies. The graph
displays an extreme skew: The vast, overwhelming majority of cases of
revolutionary threat occur in countries with a per capita GNP below
\$5,000 USD. For reference, the figure for the US in the data is about
\$65,850 in 2019. The hypothesis above---that we do not see revolutions
in developed democracies---seems borne out by the evidence.

Figure 9. Histogram of country-years with revolutions.

Source: Cross-National Time-Series Data Archive. Data drawn from 200
plus countries between 1919 and 2018 are then restricted to
country-years (N = 184) in which there were "revolutions," as well as a
"major government crisis" and "anti-government protests."

Why exactly is this true and what are the mechanisms to explain it? Why
is the revolutionary strategy impossible for a country like the US?
There are, at bottom, three reasons, each of which stands alone as a
sufficient condition to snap the last threads of one's revolutionary
faith.23 The first two suggest that revolution is unachievable, and the
last suggests that even if it is achievable, socialism by revolutionary
means is unachievable. [The **revolutionary road is closed** on the
following grounds:]{.underline}

(2) [Capitalists would **sooner grant reforms**]{.underline}

(3) [A smashed state is **more likely** to result in **tyranny** than
**deep democracy**]{.underline}

[[Not only has there **never been a successful revolution**]{.mark} in a
developed democracy, [there has **never**]{.mark} **been [a working
class that]{.mark} has [wanted one]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Erikson
and Tedin, 2015; Sassoon, 1996).24 There are no clear cases where the
dominant inclination of the working class in a developed democracy was
revolutionary. Recall that the above graph also includes attempts and
unsuccessful cases. It is self-evident that workers have not joined
revolutionary groups en masse at any point in the context of a rich
democracy. Nor were their aspirations to join such groups thwarted by
violence or ideology. When gains inside a capitalist democracy are
available---either individual or collective ones, and this has been true
even through the neoliberal period, where median living standards have
continued to (slowly) go up and not down---it is not worth risking
everything for an uncertain future (Thewissen et al., 2015).25 More
important than the dynamic point is the static one: When standards of
living are moderately high, as shown in Figure 9, the modal worker has
more to lose than her chains. This is not an argument against socialism;
but to revise Werner Sombart, the life raft of revolution really was
shipwrecked on shoals of roast beef and apple pie.

Therefore, the reasons workers are not revolutionary are materialist in
character. Explaining their reformist politics does not require appeal
to venal trade union leaders or false consciousness. [Most people **wish
to minimize risk** in their lives, and [revolution involves]{.mark}
taking on **[colossal risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example,
[**home-ownership** in the developed world hovers around 70%; this means
that a lot of [people **have a lot to lose**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

By contrast, the materialist case for revolution proposes that people
favor it when their expected post-revolutionary standards of living are
greater than their current standard (Roemer, 1985). But when we add
moderate risk- and loss-aversion the calculation changes (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1991). Say you have a low income, but own a few assets, maybe a
house, a car, and perhaps you also have a child; what risk profile would
you require to gamble your modest holdings for an uncertain future which
might be better but might be worse? [**Even if** you are
certain]{.underline} that [the **probability of better** is greater than
the **probability of worse**, you have to envision workers as a **class
of inveterate gamblers** to take the bet. **Moderately cautious
people**]{.underline} who prefer a bird in the hand [will still view the
**downside risk** as **too great**. Equal gains and losses are **not
experienced equally**. This is the **loss aversion
phenomenon**]{.underline}. But the assumption of a population confident
about improved standards of living---and a willingness to take risky
strategies to achieve them---is itself unwarranted. This is the risk
aversion phenomenon. The modal worker is of course correct to suspect
that her [**post-revolutionary welfare** is **uncertain**;
socialists]{.underline} after all [do not have satisfactory answers to
the problems of **coordination**, **motivation**, and **innovation**
under socialism]{.underline} (for attempted answers that are provocative
and oftentimes brilliant, see Albert, 2004; Cottrell and Cockshott,
1992; Corneo, 2017; Roemer, 1994; and Wright and Hahnel, 2016). [When
one compares the status quo to a future where both **heaven and hell**
are]{.underline} seemingly [plausible, it is]{.underline} perfectly
[rational]{.underline} that [people everywhere would **abandon the
barricades**]{.underline}. And abandon them they did.

Now perhaps the revolutionaries have persuaded us that negative outcomes
are far-fetched, that we are very confident that revolution will usher
in, eventually, the land of milk and honey. It is still the case that in
this model the promised land will only be reached after a social
breakdown of unknown duration: A complete overhaul in the organization
of production will lead to some middle period of deteriorating material
welfare as capitalists rapidly exit the economy. This means chaos and
uncertainty, but it could also mean war. The interregnum could last a
year, but it might last two decades, and however optimistic we are about
the end point, we cannot in advance know how long this interim phase
will persist. In the meantime, revolutionary enthusiasm will wane,
erstwhile supporters will decamp, a "stay-the-course" electoral strategy
will be outflanked by competitor parties promising a return to normalcy,
and the desire to consolidate gains will make the authoritarian impulse
greater. From a materialist perspective, the uncertain passage through
what Przeworski (1986) calls the "transition trough" makes the journey
less appealing.26

To my mind, these factors explain why [**[all working classes]{.mark}**
in **all developed democracies** [have been]{.mark} **decidedly
[reformist]{.mark}**]{.underline} in orientation. [The reason why
revolutionary socialism has always been marginal in rich capitalist
economies]{.underline}---and will always be outflanked by
reform-oriented socialism---[is that only the latter consistently
deliver **high**]{.underline} (and usually increasing) [**standards of
living** and low]{.underline} (and usually decreasing) [levels of risk.
As long as the **Mad Max world** of **catastrophic collapse** can be
avoided, reform]{.underline}-oriented parties [will always **better
capture the enthusiasm** of]{.underline} poor and [working
people]{.underline}.

Thus, when we try to explain the non-revolutionary attitudes of our
working-class friends and family, we do not need to lean on the false
consciousness account, for there is a more parsimonious materialist
explanation. As such, any case for revolution must be non-materialist in
character: You can be a materialist or a revolutionary, but not both.

This is the dilemma the revolutionaries must consider: [Revolution is
**only possible** when the **forces of production are underdeveloped**,
but it can only be successful when they are **sufficiently developed**
to make socialism]{.underline} (or communism) objectively
[viable]{.underline}.27 As Elster (1986) has argued, the circumstances
under which revolutions spark and succeed never coincide.

What about the [[capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}? Under these
circumstances, it is reasonable to expect that they will [[**fight far
harder** against a revolution than]{.mark} they would against [reformist
drives]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, ignoring the response from
capitalists violates Elster's first law of political rationality: Never
assume your opponent is less rational than you. [[If revolution were the
alt]{.mark}ernative, [employers would grant **every**]{.mark}
**imaginable [reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from far higher taxes to
the rejiggering of power relations in the workplace. [In a **mugging**,
most people will **surrender their wallet before their
life**]{.underline}.

Actors in [the state]{.underline} ought to respond in more or less the
same way---that is, as long as you admit your adversary the competence
to read the situation as well as you. If our theory of the state
suggests that it [acts on behalf of the capitalist class, its
apparatchiks would **anticipate** and **preempt** any revolutionary
crusade with a **cocktail of concession and repression**]{.underline}.
And while it will certainly contest reforms, [it will devote **all of
its resources** to break the revolution]{.underline}. Nonetheless, this
means that revolutionaries can play a crucial role, even if it is not to
foment revolution. Militancy is a powerful strategy to foment reform
(for an argument about the history of social democracy along these
lines, see Piketty, 2014).

Thus far, the main reason revolution is off the table is because no one
wants it---not workers, nor employers, nor the state.

The third point above asks us to imagine the prospects for revolutionary
success even if we ignore the wrinkle that workers have neither an
interest nor capacity to make it. But let us pretend they did:
**[Why]{.underline}** then would [we imagine that total social breakdown
would prompt a **deepening of [democracy]{.mark}** rather than
**authoritarian entrenchment**? This happy outcome [has
**never**]{.mark} **before [emerged]{.mark}** [in the wake of **social
collapse**]{.mark}, and there is little reason]{.underline} why [the
**final showdown** with the **American military** ought to produce
fertile ground for deepening democracy]{.underline} in all spheres of
life. In fact, evidence from the General Social Survey suggests that in
response to recession and economic downturn people tend to become less
altruistic and less concerned with questions of fairness.28 After
situations of economic crisis, voters tend to shift to the right
(Lindvall, 2014). The old union song cries out that "we can bring to
birth a new world from the ashes of the old," but life is not birthed on
ash. None of the historical case studies track this narrative, and
indeed everything we know about human psychology suggests that social
devastation makes people more, not less, prone to demagoguery. This
means that [**[even if]{.mark}** a [revolution were **achievable**, it
is]{.mark} probably **[undesirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The argument I have thus far laid out against revolution contends only
that it is off the table in middle-class democracies. I have in mind
social dynamics within developed capitalist democracies, countries "like
the US," but the premise no longer holds true if we imagine a society
that has already suffered some sort of catastrophic societal
disintegration---at that point all bets are off. We are of course now
talking about a world we are not living in, but it is worth considering
the thought experiment nonetheless.

It is possible that America, after some world-historic environmental or
economic collapse, begins to look something more like Russian feudalism
than contemporary developed capitalism. Revolution then might again be
on the table, but the context of desperation and scarcity in this
scenario gives little reason to expect it would incubate an egalitarian
democratic society. [The **historical evidence is unambiguous**: None of
the communist revolutions of the 20th century ushered in deeply
democratic egalitarian social structures]{.underline}. Not only are
[there **no examples**]{.underline}, but [there are]{.underline} also
[**no clear mechanisms** on offer]{.underline}.

The fact that this scenario generates an interest in bringing about an
egalitarian society by means of revolution does not mean there will be a
capacity to do so. The theory is little more than "where there is a will
there is a way." But, as Elster (1980: 124) argues, the general
interests of society do not secrete the conditions for their
fulfillment. Interests and capacities need not overlap.

There is a final reason to be skeptical of non-evolutionary strategies:
The highly dubious premise that the system we erect the morning after
will actually work. [A [socialist economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, if
plopped down tomorrow, [[would be **so rife** with]{.mark} **unintended
[consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} and pathologies [that it is easy to
imagine a [democracy vot]{.mark}ing its way [back]{.mark} in[to
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is true even if we believe
(mistakenly, in my view) that the socialist calculation debate is
solvable in the age of big data (Morozov, 2019). Interlocutors in the
calculation debate have had very little to say about the politics of
transition. Indeed, [it is hard to imagine success]{.underline} of any
kind [without a **slow and incremental transformation**, experimenting
with bits and pieces along the way]{.underline}---as we have been doing
for the past century. [An experimental approach is likely the **only
way** to avoid **devastating [blunders]{.mark}** that
**[undermine]{.mark} the [whole project]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moments
of institutional upheaval and big change may at times be necessary, but
to be successful they will have to rest on a foundation of smaller
changes that have been tested.

CC: Are there pitfalls? There are only pitfalls. This means that one can
adopt a critical denunciatory tone towards the hijacking of all possible
modes of existence by the form of 'the human' and recognise that other
modes of existence -- those that have resisted hyper-extraction and
catastrophic climate change -- nevertheless work by transforming
climates. The question is one of range: does the mode of existence that
defines the human require a global system of climate change, a network
of industries, states and institutions that make no other life possible
in its crushing relation to biodiversity? In this case [[**the human**
is]{.mark} **already less than ideal**, [producing]{.mark} a **series of
pitfalls** precisely in its **ideal** of a **life that is [nothing other
than maximisation]{.mark}** [and **profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Alternatively, one might accept pitfalls and focus on how every mode of
existence is a negotiation with a volatile planet. Can we accept that
[the **very idea of [endless growth]{.mark}**[, and
**inclusion**]{.mark} **of us all** [in **prosperity**]{.mark} and
**futurity**, is exactly what [has **annihilated**]{.mark} **forms of
[existence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that depend on minimal climate change?
[The problem with **[utopian]{.mark} conceptions of capitalist
[humanism]{.mark}** -- that we can all have smartphones, laptops and
private dwellings -- is that it [has]{.mark} **no space for pitfalls**,
**[no]{.mark} sense of a compassion or [tolerance]{.mark}**
[towards]{.mark} **forms of [life]{.mark}** that are [**not blessed**
with]{.mark} **technological [maturity]{.mark}**, no charity towards
forms of life that are neither aspiring towards, nor capable of living
with, less]{.underline}. What has come to be definitive of [**['the
human']{.mark}** both [precludes]{.mark} **many forms of possible
[existence]{.mark}** [and places]{.mark} the **[burden of]{.mark} its
own [flourishing]{.mark}** [upon those who]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
that very reason, [[are regarded as **not**]{.mark}**-yet
[human]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More specifically, to say that there is a
necessary parasitism in 'the human' would challenge some notions of
dating the Anthropocene from the moment that there is intensive
agriculture, as if there would then be a prior moment of pure ecological
harmony. The Anthropocene may seem to operate as an indictment of the
species, but it does so indiscriminately and suggests that there can be
a marker or prior date when something like the human had 'not yet'
become geologically significant. The temporality of the Anthropocene
seems to mark this point at which 'the human' becomes an inescapable and
inevitable condition, rather than opening a space for thinking at
smaller scales -- not the history of the species, but history as so many
opportunities for other futures. To say there is no intrinsic value to
the species both opens the idea that the form the human takes now -- in
its massively destructive mode -- is one that seems absolutely valuable
from within but has no necessary value beyond its own attachments, while
also allowing for a transvaluation of what appears as the end of the
world.

Working within the literary tradition -- perhaps suspending normativity
-- one can observe the ways [[a]{.mark} **moral [binary]{.mark}** [is
formed between]{.mark} **'the [human']{.mark}** (the world of private
property and technological maturity) [and]{.mark} a **seeming
[statelessness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There's a notion of literature as
to some extent suspending normativity, allowing things to be said that
are in quotation marks or not one's own. At a simple critical level, it
is possible to note that [[**'the human'** is **not the species**,
but]{.mark} a **highly [normative and]{.mark} frequently [violently
exclusive concept]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So, [one quality of
questioning the human is that **suspension of attachment**: what **forms
of [existence]{.mark}** [might be **possible beyond**]{.mark} **the
[assumption]{.mark}** that **the [world]{.mark}**, as it is, **simply
[ought]{.mark} to [be saved]{.mark}**?]{.underline} At a deeper level,
though, that suspension is itself normative and tied to a form of 'the
human' that is critically distanced from its world. This suspension
could take two forms -- highly privatised (as in Richard Rorty's notion
of irony, where each subject adopts a necessarily public discourse but
always with a degree of detachment) -- or collective. Regarding its
collective form, one can think of broad projects of collective refusal.
Whatever else it might have meant, one of the ways to read Occupy's
conception of the 1 percent was to say that the world that is being held
up is not the world of private attachments.

What ties your questions together is the problem of accusing who 'we'
are, as if there is some privileged space of critique that would look at
the human as an unworthy species. But that is the point of view of the
Anthropocene that delimits something like 'the human' within geological
time. [**[The Anthropocene]{.mark}** not only marks a **certain mode**
of **human existence** but also **[relies upon]{.mark}** the sense of
[**'the human'**. **What looks**]{.mark} **like a [collective]{.mark}
concept** [actually **precludes**]{.mark} any]{.underline} sense of the
[**[different]{.mark} form of non-privatised [existence]{.mark}** [that
did not assume]{.mark} the general form of **[possessive
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the things I have tried to get
at with focusing on parasitism is that [[**climate change** is **not
some**]{.mark} **unfortunate late [accident]{.mark}** -- 'oh no, we
changed the climate!' -- [but is **intrinsic to 'the human'**]{.mark}.
The human as [a **category**]{.mark} is [bound up with **globalism**,
**imperialism**, **capitalism** and]{.mark}
**hyper-[consumption]{.mark}**; it is a category so large as [to
**preclude**]{.mark} **forms of [solidarity]{.mark}** that **would be
[possible]{.mark}** [in **genuinely collective**]{.mark} **forms of
[existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Caring for a space of land, working
on networks of support where being in common does not amount to being of
one's own kind: existing in other forms of collective that are not those
of the generic human family are possible. The question, then, is not one
of being inside or outside the Anthropocene -- inside or outside the
Capitalocene, finding some moment before destruction, finding some
pitfall-free space of ecological harmony -- but of thinking more
critically and differentially about the various ways in which climates
are changed. The idea of a pristine space that is untouched by human
existence is crucial to a capitalism of climate change; the imagination
of a new world that would be available for colonisation cannot be
detached from the dream of a pure ecology. It is especially obvious in
Australia that colonisation was climate change. The importation of
European agriculture followed from an assumption that the land being
invaded was untouched. It is better to think of differences of degree in
the ways multiple climates are changed, rather than a difference in kind
between the Anthropocene and its pure others.

3 Undoing Humanity

The involvement of those particular cosmological expressions in white
supremacist myths reveals a different liability to the Anthropocene idea
and a separate task for religious ethics. Teilhard and Vernadsky both
espoused a liberal, anti-Nazi form of white supremacy in which
[**[universal humanism]{.mark}** was grounded in]{.underline} qualities
of humanity exemplified in [modern European cultural forms]{.underline}
(Slattery 2017; Evans 2022). [That **paradoxical universalism** [permits
**"humanity"** to]{.mark}]{.underline} at once [[**authorize and conceal
violence** against **people excluded** from **it**]{.mark}**s normative
exemplification**]{.underline}. (Europeans have a mandate to induct
other people into the cultural forms by which human dignity is properly
realized, and if those others refuse then Europeans have an obligation
to the idea of humanity to displace and develop those peoples.) [By
drawing on]{.underline} theological stories in which it is [the
**special role of [(white) humans]{.mark}** to **[transform evolutionary
processes]{.mark}**, the Anthropocene idea **recapitulates** that
**pattern of authorizing and concealing violence**. "It serves [to
**re-invisibilize**]{.mark} the **power of [Eurocentric
narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline}," write Davis and Todd (2017, 763).
[The [humanity which must **steward planet**]{.mark}**ary
systems**]{.underline} actually names particular social forms that
[[have]{.mark} **already [appropriated]{.mark}** much of [the
**biosphere**]{.mark}]{.underline} for themselves, first [[by
rendering]{.mark} **its [relations]{.mark}** [into **"resources"**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} then by [[deploying **extractive**]{.mark}
**colonialism and racial [capitalism]{.mark}** to take them. Meanwhile
the **planetary [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline} of that
appropriation [[are **anonymized** as]{.mark} the **[fault of
humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline} in general, which erases the historical
violence from which the climate crisis emerges and launders the
resulting intensification of inequalities into a predicament for the
species. Humanity can function as a laundering concept, [assigning both
**causes** and **consequences of climate change** to **the species in
general**, rendering invisible **the historical and structural
violence** from which it is **produced** and
**experienced**]{.underline}.3

Postcolonial and black critical thought offer a range of reasons for why
that should be expected of Anthropos. [The **[deployment]{.mark} of
"humanity"** in **climate discourse**]{.underline}, writes Sylvia
Wynter, [**[repeats]{.mark}** the **[500-year]{.mark} colonial
[history]{.mark}** [of identifying]{.mark} **modern [European]{.mark}
ways** of **being [human]{.mark}** [with **humanity**]{.mark}
**itself**; only now, the [**culpability** and **consequences** of
modern "Man" are **generalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} to humanity. "The
single issue with which global warming and climate instability now
confronts us," says Wynter, is replacing the "referent-we" of Man-made
climate change "with the ecumenically human ends of the referent-we in
the horizon of humanity" (Wynter and McKittrick 2015, 24). [[**The Man**
who **warms the planet**]{.underline}]{.mark} while also identifying as
humanity in general is a figure who [[was **constructed from violence**
against **black and Indigenous people**]{.underline}]{.mark}, not as a
departure from its norm but [as its **silent premise**]{.underline}.
"The crafting and sustaining of European human life and self-actualizing
through Black and Indigenous death," argues Tiffany Lethabo King, is
foundational to modern humanity (2019, 84). [The **[humanity]{.mark}**
that informs descriptions of climate crisis and avenues of
responsibility for it]{.underline} often [**[reproduces]{.mark}** a
[notion of]{.mark} **being [human]{.mark}** [premised on]{.mark}
**colonial and [anti-black violence]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[Climate crisis]{.underline}** may then [provide reason **not to
extend** the concept of humanity but rather **[dispense with
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "The normative subject of [**liberal
humanism** is **predicated** on the **abjection of
blackness**]{.underline}," writes Zakkiyah Jackson, arguing that it is
therefore time to depart from humanity as an ideal (2020, 18--20). With
similar pessimism toward humanity as common morality, Achille Mbembe
holds that [the **["unacknowledged foundation"]{.mark}** of that ideal
[is]{.mark} the [**invention of blackness** to identify **which
members**]{.mark} **of the species** [could be **rendered**]{.mark} into
**[merchandise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Then, in the era of neoliberal
remaking of the planet, writes Mbembe, blackness was generalized: "this
new fungibility, this solubility, institutionalized as a new norm of
existence and expanded to the entire planet, is what I call the Becoming
Black of the World" (Mbembe 2017, 6).4 [The
"[humanity]{.mark}"]{.underline} at work [in climate
discourse]{.underline} thus at once [**[conceals]{.mark} historical
[agents of violence]{.mark}** [and **redistributes responsibility**
for]{.mark} **their [consequences]{.mark}**[, while
**reproducing**]{.mark} **a [modern]{.mark} way of being
[human]{.mark}** [premised on]{.mark} an **unacknowledged foundation of
[anti-black violence]{.mark}**. The universalism of Anthropos is its
most racialized aspect]{.underline}. "The centrality of race to the
production of humanity in the Anthropocene," Yusoff summarizes,
"requires a reconfiguration of the subject at the center of white
liberal ethical accounts and an acknowledgment of the role of race in
the production of the global spaces that constitute the Anthropocene"
(2018, 61). Does recognizing race within a full understanding of
historical material forces shaping the planet require relinquishing
humanity as normative concept?

1 \| INTRODUCTION: THE ANTHROPOCENE

[Scientists tell us that we live in a new epoch or age:
**Anthropocene**, the age of [humans]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lewis &
Maslin, 2015; Steffen et al., 2011; Waters et al., 2014). Castree (2015,
p. 302) explains [that no matter what actions we take now]{.underline}
to make amends, ["Homo sapiens]{.underline}--most [especially those **in
the West**--[have **already altered the planet**]{.mark}**\'s future**
through their past (post-1800) and present actions]{.underline}". All
humans are now involved in geography--Earth-Writing--by "writing
themselves into Earth history" (Castree, 2015, p. 302).

Dipesh Chakrabarty (2012) brings to fore two images of human beings that
illustrate the dilemma of the Anthropocene--humans as a political force
and as a geological force. As political beings, we seek justice, as
(supposedly) right-bearing citizens, while knowing that full justice is
unachievable. Therefore, we continue to engage in survival politics. We
can also understand this survival politics as politics of/for justice.
As a geological force, humans, that is, all humans emerge as a
collective author of actions that have resulted in myriad environmental
challenges, most prominently the climate crisis. These two seemingly
incompatible images of human beings proposed by Chakrabarty open a
dilemma of justice versus urgency. One forces us to think of difference
and the other prompts us to think of a universal human agency. [This
realisation of human agency [has brought]{.mark} a certain [sense
of]{.mark} **shared [universal urgency]{.mark}** that calls [for
**swift**]{.mark} **"preventive [action"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Baucom
& Omelsky, 2017; Simon, 2017, p. 241) [[and **techno-managerial
control**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Simpson, 2020), for example, [[for
**climate change mitigation** and **rapid**]{.mark} **energy
[transitions]{.mark}**. This is a dilemma because urgency]{.underline},
while not fully misplaced, [risks **[compromising]{.mark}**]{.underline}
due course, discussion, and **[[justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For energy geographers, the dilemma of urgency versus justice manifests
as a need to find pathways for urgent actions on climate change
mitigation and energy transitions while centering historical and
contemporary justice questions. This is not to argue that energy
geographies have not engaged with the question of justice rooted in
difference. Geographers have indeed established a very fruitful body of
work on energy justice (Feenstra & Özerol, 2021; Jenkins et al., 2016;
Yenneti & Day, 2015). Yet, more work is needed to provide "a necessary
vocabulary to analyze intersecting and historical forms of injustices as
well as methods to evaluate the consequences of multiple forms of
oppression in a relational manner" (Cannon & Chu, 2021, p. 8),
especially under pressure from a universalising discourse of
Anthropocene urgency. Thinking through this dilemma might help set a
firmer footing in justice to face an ever-strengthening discourse of
urgency rooted in the universal-human image. This paper sketches some
future areas of work in energy geographies within the Anthropocene
discourse.

[The overwhelming **['one humanity' narrative]{.mark} of the
Anthropocene**]{.underline} is premised on and leads to three things.
First, it [[talks of]{.mark} a **[universal history]{.mark}** of the
Earth that is premised on **[implicating]{.mark}**]{.underline}
'humans', **[[all humans]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Yusoff, 2018b). This
needs to be nuanced and 'othered' histories brought into the
conversation. Second, [the [universal has]{.mark} **long ignored** and
**[decimated difference]{.mark}** and a discussion of justice premised
on difference]{.underline}. Third, [**this idea of the
[universal]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} embedded in and centres **[European
epistemology]{.mark} and knowledge systems**]{.underline} (Davis & Todd,
2017). These three points are important not only to understand and
assign historical responsibilities but also to find just pathways for
future collective actions. To think of a more political Anthropocene,
one that explicitly embeds within itself justice rooted in difference,
this paper outlines three areas of work. First, the paper proposes a
need to engage with and learn from energy histories other than those
from the Euro-American contexts (Section 3). Second, it asks for more
focus on questions of difference (Section 4). Third, the paper proposes
a deeper engagement with critical race theory and
postcolonial/decolonial theories to investigate questions of justice
(Section 5).

2 \| ANTHROPOCENE URGENCY

This section briefly explores the emergence of climate emergency and
urgency and how an Anthropocene-driven ['one humanity' narrative
**shapes**]{.underline} 'our' **[responsibility]{.underline}**. Castree
(2015, p. 302) explicates that three interrelated ideas-- [**the
[Anthropocene]{.mark}**, **planetary boundaries**, and **tipping
points**]{.underline}--suggest, "Humans [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
entering Terra incognita", a realm of the unknown. These have [come to
solidify the idea of an [**emergency** that **demands urgency** from
humans]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example Rockström et al. (2009),
proposes nine planetary limits or boundaries inside which humans can
operate in a 'safe operating space' created by Holocene conditions. The
planetary boundaries depicted in green and red colours, overlaid on an
image of the Earth, along with the use of phrases like "safe operating
space", bring a sense of alarm and evoke an idea of urgency and
emergency--a red flashing alarm (D'Souza, 2018, p. 4). This sense of
alarm is also visible in constructs like doughnut economics that take
inspiration from planetary boundaries (Raworth, 2017). The sense of
urgency is not misplaced. There is enough scientific evidence to warn
that we are either very close to or have gone beyond the climate tipping
point (IPCC, 2019; Lenton et al., 2019). In addition, shared global
phenomena like climate change require some form of common and
coordinated action.

However, [the risk posed by]{.underline} the [urgency discourse is
elevated because **humans as a geological force** is the]{.underline}
main argument behind the [dominant and widely accepted framing of the
Anthropocene in a Eurocentric academy]{.underline} (Todd, 2015). This
dominant framing of an "abstract universal Anthropos" is problematic in
many ways, not least for [the **["racial]{.mark} and colonial
[logics"]{.mark}** [embedded in]{.mark}]{.underline} it (Davis et al.,
2019, p. 3). An Anthropocene debate centring [**the
['universal']{.mark}** [risks **de-historicising responsibilities** for
**climate**]{.mark} **change**,]{.underline} environmental degradation
[[and]{.mark} **energy [transitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [framing
them as **post-political**]{.underline} (Daggett, 2020; Swyngedouw,
2019). A post-political condition is one [in which power and politics
are "written out of]{.underline} the mainstream...account of
[environmental transformation" and one of two explanations are promoted:
(1) **[we are all in this together, equally]{.mark}**; and (2) this is a
result of **abstract forces like capitalism** which serve as
**"teleological 'black-box."**]{.underline} (Ranganathan & Doshi, 2018,
p. 2). These risk the exclusion of an explicit politics of justice.

Therefore, it is worth asking if a sense of **['global'
[emergency]{.mark}]{.underline}** writ large [risks heralding a
post-political Anthropocene]{.underline}, one [that **[demands falling
in line]{.mark}**]{.underline}, putting questions of difference,
justice, rights, and responsibilities aside: uniting [by
**[putting]{.mark}**]{.underline} (our) **[[difference(s)
aside]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is because while the Anthropocene
calls us to unite, its impacts are, and will be, felt differently
(Jazeel, 2019). As Kathryn Yusoff (2018a) reminds us,
[**[geology]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} by implication, geography and
[**the Anthropocene** are **deeply [embedded]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} a
[**history** of **racialisation**]{.mark}, **racial discrimination**
[and **colonisation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also, Saldanha, 2020;
Tolia-Kelly, 2016). [If we are to politically, or]{.underline} even
[discursively, understand, experience and respond as a geological force,
such [response needs]{.mark} to be built by **[ethically
centring]{.mark}**]{.underline} subaltern [**groups** who have **borne
the brunt of [historical injustices]{.mark}** upon [**which** the
Anthropocene is **premised**]{.mark}]{.underline} and who will bear the
gravest impacts of the Anthropocene (Davis & Todd, 2017; Jazeel, 2019;
Yusoff, 2018a). As Madden (2019) considers, all spaces increasingly
reflect a concern for and impacts of the climate emergency. This is
being overlaid on other socio-cultural and economic crises, so that "the
climate crisis is also itself constitutively shaped by other...problems,
processes, and hierarchies" (Madden, 2019, p. 2). Evidence of this is
manifesting in new neoliberal projects around smart grids and cities and
eco-gentrification, and geo-engineering (Rice et al., 2019; Simpson,
2020). In addition, [the **[urgency]{.mark} debate** and the need to
unify under an Anthropocene narrative "further [delegitimize
**alternate**]{.mark} **forms of cultural [knowledge]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **embodied [practices]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline},
in so doing, [**[reproduce]{.mark}** and **reinforce
[injustices]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Schmidt et al., 2016, p. 196; Todd,
2015).

#### Perm solves - deconstructing humanism is a prerequisite to solving your impacts

**Snaza et al 14.** Nathan Snaza is Director of the Bridge to Success
Program and member of the English Department at the University of
Richmond, USA. His writings have appeared in journals such as Journal of
Curriculum and Pedagogy, Angelaki, Educational Researcher and Journal of
Critical Animal Studies. \["Toward a Posthumanist Education" Journal of

Writing about the relations between critiques of specieism and critiques
of racism--- relations that have not been given nearly enough attention
by scholars---Seshadri (2012) writes that "**[perhaps it is time we
acknowledge that [we cannot do anything at all about the appalling ways
human beings treat other human beings or animals without
rethinking]{.mark} and renewing [our norms, presuppositions, platitudes,
and morals with regard to life and what is
living]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (p. 11). Building on such an insight,
Snaza (2013) argues: [[feminism, anti-racist, and postcolonial
studies]{.mark} on the one hand [and posthumanism]{.mark} on the other
[must supplement each other]{.mark}]{.underline}. The former provide
powerful critiques of the historical complexities of dehumanization
without offering a theoretical account of how these realities derive
from a structural problem with the "human," while the latter is too
focused on the present moment to realize that the political importance
of posthumanism's reconceptualization of "the human" is most clear in
relation to the history of dehumanization. (p. 48) Although there remain
a number of problems with a simple suturing of posthumanism and the
critical projects of postcolonial, feminist, queer, indigenous,
antiracist, and disability studies, recent studies by Seshadri (2012)
and Chen (2012) go a considerable distance toward demonstrating [why
[concern with racism, sexism, ableism, and heteronormativity can no
longer afford to ignore the troubled]{.mark} (and troubling) [boundaries
that are policed between human and nonhuman, living and
nonliving.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### LINK TURN\-\--Settler Colonialism focus on indigenous land and territorial rights produces a form of colonial unknowing that both erases afro-indigeneity and intensifies settler-native binaries

Indigenous and Black Relations in the Americas: A Few Notes

The [unfixing]{.underline} of [settler coloniality]{.underline} also
[demands attention to blackness. The frequent erasure of blackness from
settler colonial analyses has resonance in]{.underline} how we
understand Indigenous and Black relations particularly vis-a-vis land
and territorial rights. In fact, in a recent commentary American
historian Robin Kelley (2017) questions Wolfe's [assumptions of the role
of Black Africans in settler landscapes]{.underline}. In particular, it
is Wolfe's assertion [that]{.underline} "[Black Americans were primarily
colonised for their labour rather than for their land"]{.underline},
that Kelley rightly asserts, deserves interrogation (Wolfe, quoted in
Kelley 2017:268). [Such a presumption falsely reduces Black people to
labour, obscures their dispossession from their own ancestral
territories (in Africa) and thus their rights to Indigenous lands,
emptying blackness out of settler colonial analyses]{.underline} (Kelley
2017; King 2016; Mollett 2018a). [Such assumptions
reproduce]{.underline} themselves in numerous studies, reflecting [a
"colonial unknowing]{.underline}" (Vimalassery et al. 2016), [which
"presumes that indigenous peoples exist only in the Americas and
Australasia. African indigeneity is erased in this formulation
because]{.underline}, through linguistic slight of hand, [Africans are
turned into Black Americans]{.underline}" (Kelley 2017:268). I would add
that [such thinking also ignores the constitutive role anti-blackness
plays in a "logic of elimination" entangled in the multiple racial
regimes of land control in Abya Yala and Turtle Island.]{.underline}

In large part, geographers writing on the US and Canada, including many
political ecologists, have followed Wolfe and continually reify
[settler-native binaries]{.underline} in their scholarship (for an
exception see Bonds and Inwood 2015). For Pulido (2018:310), this tends
to occur because "Geography, with few exceptions \... has only
considered whites in relation to settler colonialism". Inadvertently
this move [situates people of African descent]{.underline} as [outside
of indigeneity and unaffected by settler colonial power]{.underline}
(Kelley 2017; for a brilliant critique on this issue see Day 2015; for
an important exception see King 2019). Certainly, I agree, as
Moreton-Robertson et al. (2008:84) note, that "the question of how
anyone comes to be white or black in the United States is inextricably
tied to the dispossession of original owners" is indeed true, without
qualification. Still, it is also true that [to suggest that
"all]{.underline} others [\[non-indigenous peoples\] are
migrants]{.underline}" (Curley and Smith 2020:39) [simplifies our
understandings and analyses of settler colonial power]{.underline}. In
addition, I would humbly add that [these binaries overlook]{.underline}
a keen lesson from Tonawanda Seneca feminist scholar Mishuana Goeman.
Goeman (2008:24) maintains [that "the need for Indigenous Nations to
legitimate land claims in a Western court system creates]{.underline} a
focus on 'accumula\[tions\]' of past rather than a focus on a living
land that is imagined and held in Indigenous philosophies". I see [the
reproduction of the settler-Indigenous binary as product of a focus on
the "accumulations of the past" eliding black presences and relations to
land.]{.underline}

To counter this tendency, Byrd's Transit of Empire (2011) seeks to
expose what she calls "the impasse of settlement and slavery" (Byrd
2019:209). In so doing she offers "a way to hold two truths in
cacophonous balance: [US modernity was created through the genocide of
indigenous peoples]{.underline} and [the seizure of indigenous lands,
and]{.underline} US modernity was created through [chattel
slavery]{.underline}" (ibid., emphasis added). Byrd's theorisation of
Black Africans in the Americas as "arrivants" is a welcomed attempt to
complicate the subjectivities of settler colonial power and to
acknowledge the presence and histories of people of African descent in
the Americas as part of settler colonial societies. In addition, there
is growing scholarly accord that [Indigenous peoples' land dispossession
is woven into and representative of the same set of "colonial logics
through which]{.underline} men and women from [Africa and Asia were
forcibly transported to]{.underline} in [the Americas]{.underline}, who
with native, mixed and creole peoples constituted colonial societies
that produced the assets for the bourgeois republics in Europe and North
America \..." (Lowe 2015:20). [Recognising such intimate histories of
race and coloniality]{.underline} in the present [is important to
political ecologies of race]{.underline}. Indeed, multiple racial
regimes inform the land control and claims-making strategies of
Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples across the hemisphere. A view
from Latin America may help complicate settler-native binaries. To
punctuate the point, I reflect briefly from my research in Honduras.

The Mosquitia region of Honduras is home to the Honduran Miskito
Peoples. Since 2013 the Miskito enjoy state sanctioned territorial
legislation and rights to the Miskito ancestral homeland (Mollett 2016).
However, while important and hard fought, territorial boundaries obscure
the multiple and overlapping people and land relations that make up
everyday life. On the Caribbean coast and inside the Rio Platano
Biosphere Reserve, an internationally recognised protected area, Miskito
communities share Reserve lands with other ethnic/Indigenous groups,
including the Garifuna peoples. The Garifuna are Afro-Indigenous peoples
who arrived in Honduras in 1797 before the consolidation of the Honduran
state. Under the Honduran Constitution, they hold rights to "communal"
lands as "pueblos autoctonos " (autochthonous peoples) (Republica de
Honduras 1982). The Garifuna claim, however, that the territories of
their homeland extend along the Honduran north coast, beyond the
"communal" boundaries set by the state and into the overlapping spaces
of the Miskito territory inside the Mosquitia (Mollett 2013, 2014). Lasa
Pulan, a small plot of land, was once a site and subject of long time
tensions between the Garifuna community of Plaplaya and the Miskito
community of Ibans. The conflict emerged most recently during a
counter-mapping project funded by the Ford Foundation (Mollett 2013). On
one hand, the discord reflected years of mutual distrust between the
Miskito and Garifuna and was, at that time, being dramatised for state
and international onlookers who were tasked to draw boundaries and
legitimate territorial claims as part of a "counter-mapping" project. In
fact, both groups, who are of similar racial ancestries, liberally used
derogatory racial stereotypes as a way to discredit each other's claims.
These stereotypes reflect a popular and homogenising depiction within
Latin American historiography that situates Black and Indigenous peoples
as oppositional subjectivities (Mollett 2013; Restall 2005). In the case
of Lasa Pulan, the Miskito challenge Garifuna "Indigenous" claims due to
their phenotypical blackness, a wellrehearsed accusation often used by
the Honduran state to deny the Garifuna their constitutional benefits to
ancestral lands as "pueblos autoctonos ". To undermine Garifuna claims,
the Miskito argue that the Garifuna are "sea people" and not farmers,
and thus they accuse the Garifuna of trying to "steal" Miskito land. The
Garifuna, in turn, counter with accusations of the Miskito as "docile
Indians" doing the work of the state, to reproduce anti-blackness as
reflected in the logic of mestizaje where shared indigenous and criollos
(Central American born whites) ancestries are seen to contribute to the
mestizo nation (the country's dominant ethnic group), but where blacks
are considered "interlopers" (Anderson 2009). While seemingly
contradictory for the Miskito, as they too share African ancestry, this
is nonetheless a powerful narrative that aligns with ongoing state
refusals to designate and protect Garifuna territories beyond the model
that grants residential land titles (and not territories or farmland) as
"communal lands"(Mollett 2014). The politics of land in Honduras is
co-constitutive of Black and Indigenous entanglements.

Still, with the benefit of ongoing ethnographic research, this conflict
reveals something deeper. The struggle for Lasa Pulan discloses a
profound and intimate history of conviviality, cooperation and
negotiation, which includes borrowing each other's lands in times of
crisis, intra-community marriages, friendships, extended kin, business
relations, environmental seminars, farming and mapping workshops, and
collective resistance. Racial narratives are part of a repertoire of
land and territorial struggle throughout Honduras. To be sure, the
Honduran state and elite are who wield racial discourses most violently
(often with the support of the military) (Mollett 2017). Despite past
tensions over Lasa Pulan, the everyday lived realities of life in the
Mosquitia unearth that there is little, if any, disagreement that their
territories, and concomitant Black and Indigenous peoples are actively
and intimately woven with the land and each other (Mollett 2013, 2016).
Indeed, inadvertently, the victory of the territorial legislation of
Miskito homelands inside the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve codifies Lasa
Pulan as a contemporaneously shared space of intimate and inter-ethnic
histories and geographies inside the Honduran Mosquitia.

Thus, in line with Kelley and others, [race as phenotype is an
unreliable marker of indigeneity. The presence of blackness does not
ipso facto negate]{.underline} a history of multiple [socio-cultural
linkages to land, territory and to nature.]{.underline} I contend that
these connections are more visible among the political ecologies of race
scholarship in Latin America (Asher 2009; Bryan 2012, 2019; Escobar
2008; Hernandez Reyes 2019). Moreover, it is worth repeating that
[blackness and indigeneity are relational]{.underline}. As Bledsoe
(2017), among others (see Miles 2005), reminds us, [during slavery,
maroon communities]{.underline} (palenques and quilombos) [in Latin
America and the Caribbean created spaces of resistance and refuge where
the enslaved and free blacks sought freedom]{.underline}. Certainly,
[maroon spaces were not exclusively Black, but rather brought together
Indigenous peoples]{.underline} and [poor whites and many mixed race
peoples to "create ways of life that rejected the violent ordering to
which Brazilian elites sought to subject the masses"]{.underline}
(Bledsoe 2017:35). Indeed, hemispheric [political ecologies of race must
reject simple binaries and dichotomies]{.underline} reproduced from
other literatures, [and instead complicate Blackness and Indigeneity and
their socio-spatial meanings and attachments to land through an
intellectual desire to unearth their relations.]{.underline} To do so,
may mean troubling settler colonialism as a singular structure, thinking
through a "coloniality of power" for US and Canada, and/or urging more
attention to "conquest" as decolonial/postcolonial and black feminists
scholars do (Cordis 2019; King 2019; Lowe 2015; Lugones 2007; McKittrick
2013). As King (2016) notes, "conquest is a larger conceptual and
material terrain than settler colonialism and far more suited for the
regional/hemispheric particularities of coloniality in the Americas and
the specific ways diasporic Blackness gives conquest ,genocide and
settlement its form and feel". I illustrate these insights in the
section below.

### Perm\-\--2AC

#### The permutation is a Black-Indigenist perspective on antiblackness and colonial settlement -- rather than understanding Blackness and Indigeneity as discrete categories, we recognize that antiblack settlement has produced interwoven relations of genocide and enslavement targeted against Black and Native life -- this entangled experience of violence also sparked mass resistance and survival in the face of white settlement -- erasing this history colludes with the colonial outpost's strategy of divide-and-conquer

been at home in the world": A case for Black-Indigenism," *Curriculum
Inquiry* Volume 49 Issue 1) gz

[[**Black-Indigenism** gives name to]{.mark} and/or subsumes particular
types of **de-/[anti-colonial thought and praxis]{.mark} that have long
been in existence**, namely, de-/anti-colonial thought and praxes [that
**prioritize the**]{.mark} **experiences and [liberation of both Black
and Indigenous peoples worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In
[the]{.mark} Black [American]{.mark} context, a]{.underline}
protectionist or **[[nation-bound experience of Blackness]{.mark} often
[obscures]{.mark} Black American connection to and [involvement
with]{.mark} historic intra- and [international liberation
movements]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Clemons & Jones, 2001, p. 20).
[Despite this **lack of acknowledgement**, the **numerous examples** of
Black American engagement with diasporic or other-worldly liberatory
work hints at the possibilities promised within the wider
Black-Indigenist paradigm]{.underline}.

Drake (1993) notes that [[**Haitian independence** became]{.mark} a
[symbolic of the]{.mark} global [Diasporic Black imaginary]{.mark} as a
"'real' history" that was "available for inspiration]{.underline}
instead of mythic history" (p. 452). Further, from the time of Haitian
independence [throughout the 1800s,]{.underline} [**Black American
emigrationists** offered departure from the United States as the primary
solution to the ills of anti-Black settler colonialism, while **[W.E.B.
DuBois, Anna Julia Cooper, and Marcus Garvey]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([who was active both in his home country of Jamaica as well as the
United States]{.underline}) [all famously [addressed the plights of
African-descended peoples around the world]{.mark}]{.underline} (Clemons
& Jones, 2001, p. 20). [The 19[50s-]{.mark}19[60s **independence
movements of sub-Saharan Africa**]{.mark}**n countries** [were
compelling to Black movements worldwide]{.mark}, and Black American
[civil rights leaders']{.mark} and organizations' later **[opposition
to]{.mark} the [Vietnam]{.mark} War** [was well-known]{.mark} and based
on implications that the war was part of the larger and historical
Western imperialist and colonialist project]{.underline}. And, [while
**[the B]{.mark}lack [P]{.mark}anther [P]{.mark}arty's work and
thought** [were heavily influenced by]{.mark} those resisting
imperialist and colonialist domination in their own
contexts]{.underline} ([such as **[Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, Frantz
Fanon, and Kwame Nkrumah]{.mark}**]{.underline}), [[the Party]{.mark}
also heavily **[influenced]{.mark} the work and thought of [groups
resisting colonialist]{.mark} and racist [contexts]{.mark} around the
globe, including groups [in Israel, India, England, Australia, Bermuda,
and the Bahamas]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Clemons & Jones, 2001;
McCartney, 2001).

[These examples point to **a Pan-Africanism orientation to
Black-Indigenist decolonizing movements**]{.underline}. Drake (1993)
defined "traditional Pan-African activity" as "movement... within
various parts of the \[B\]lack world to increase cultural contacts
between its diverse segments and to unite them in pursuit of common
interests," while defining the Black world as including "all those areas
where the population is actually \[B\]lack in a phenotypic sense... or
where the people think of themselves as \[B\]lack despite \[additional
non-African ancestry\] or where they are so defined by others" (p. 453).
In addition to this, cultural Pan-Africanism highlights cultural ties
between Black Diasporic and African peoples, and does not necessarily
have political aims (Drake, 1993, p. 463). Drake notes that [the most
nuanced traditional Pan-Africanist political thought and action connects
global Black struggle to the struggles of all oppressed peoples in the
Global South -- and working-class peoples around the world, whether in
rural or urban environments -- **while not allowing Black interests to
irretrievably disappear into those struggles**]{.underline}. Further,
such nuance demands that Black people should "maintain a high level of
race consciousness in their local situations" (Drake, 1993, p. 463).

[While Pan-Africanist thought and work is reflected in the priorities of
Black-Indigenism, **Black-Indigenism contends that [the concept of
indigeneity is equally as important as]{.mark} that of [Blackness,
as]{.mark} both concepts serve related and principal functions vis-à-vis
Western colonialism**]{.underline}. [Within Black-Indigenism,
[liberation for Black people about the world **cannot be**]{.mark}
**responsibly [obtained without]{.mark} the [liberation of Indigenous
people as well, and vice versa]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Because of this,
while Pan-Africanist thought provides important supports for
Black-Indigenism, **it is not complete, in that it primarily attends to
the struggles**]{.underline} and intelligence **[of one (albeit massive)
group of Indigenous peoples -- Black Africans -- rather than to those of
Indigenous peoples the world over]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[Black-Indigenism *equally* attends to the struggles of Diasporic
Blacks]{.underline}** (as the group that has been historically forced to
lose their indigeneity) **[and the struggles of global Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}** (as the group that has historically struggled to
maintain their indigeneity and/or Indigenous lands) [in an effort to
**resist and heal from the effects of centuries of Western colonialist
dominance**]{.underline}.

With this Black-Indigenist dual prioritization in mind and within the US
context, it is important to note that documentation of direct
connections between Native and Black American resistance and resilience
work is not quite as pervasive as discussions of Black-American
Pan-Africanist work. Examples do exist, however. Jack Forbes (1993)
notes that, [in addition to researcher assertions of **Indigenous
African and American maritime travel to each other's respective
continents before Columbus' landing**[, the "greatest]{.mark} degree of
intense [contact]{.mark} between Americans and Africans [did not
occur]{.mark} initially [in]{.mark} either [the Americas or Africa,
but]{.mark} rather **[in European cities]{.mark} such as Lisbon, Seville
and Valencia**[" due to **Europe's trade in both Indigenous Americans
and Africans**]{.mark} during and after the time of Columbus' genocidal
exploits]{.underline} (p. 26). [The Iberian Peninsula had a long history
of enslavement, with enslaved peoples of "all colors and of many
nationalities" becoming part of the regional socioeconomic fabric
throughout the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries]{.underline} (Forbes, 1993, p. 27). [While most of the
enslaved peoples were historically of European and North African
descent, **increasing incursions into the Americas and sub-Saharan
Africa brought increasingly larger numbers Indigenous peoples** from
both of these continents together in Spain and Portugal]{.underline}.

[As it became more economically expedient to keep Indigenous Americans
within the Americas, and as the plantation empires overtook the search
for precious metals, more and more Indigenous Americans were shipped
throughout the American continent, while more and more Indigenous
Africans were kidnapped and brought to the Americas]{.underline}.
**[Despite this dominant trend, []{.mark}there is still evidence of
Indigenous Americans' being brought to Europe at the same time
Indigenous Africans were, and even evidence of Indigenous Americans'
being sent to Africa -- whether as enslaved or free workers, or for
punishment]{.underline}** (Forbes, 1993, pp. 37--39).4

While it can be easily assumed that such an extensive history of shared
enslavement encouraged the comingling of two groups who had never
previously encountered each other in such numbers, **[[this
history]{.mark} often [encouraged shared resistance]{.mark} as
well]{.underline}**. [Perhaps the best long-term example of this shared
resistance is in **[marronage and resistance against
enslavement]{.mark}**, the phenomenon that [took place across]{.mark}
the Americas [as an **often joint Indigenous**]{.mark} **American [and
African]{.mark}/African-descended [response to
enslavement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Beginning with the account of
enslaved Africans and African-descended people that were abandoned by or
**overtook their captors to escape "into the interior of the US,"**
[Douglas]{.mark}]{.underline} (2015) [[goes]{.mark} [on to explain
**Indigenous American**]{.mark} **support of and/or subsequent
[community-making with formerly enslaved]{.mark}
African/African-descended [people over 300 years]{.mark}... [and
European fear of such connections]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Early on in his book Robinson (1997) notes that, [with the "enactment of
the slave codes[, **both Black and Native**]{.mark} **American [slaves
were denied allies in the Euro-American poor]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (p.
9), indicating that, **[until 1776, slave revolts could have included
enslaved Indigenous Americans as well -- or enslaved people of both
American and African descent -- rather than Indigenous Americans' solely
fighting as allies of enslaved African-descended peoples]{.underline}**.
Further, Robinson (1997) cites Aptheker (1939), who asserted that
**[[there was evidence of at least 50 maroon communities in the
south]{.mark}ern United States (dated from 1672 to 1864)]{.underline}**,
and that, [**contrary to what even the few historians of marronage
assert**, "marronage]{.underline}... [was not just a Black
phenomenon":]{.underline} indeed, [[maroon
communities]{.underline}]{.mark} not only **[[included formerly enslaved
Indigenous Americans]{.mark}, or Indigenous Americans from "'destroyed
nations,'"]{.underline}** but even the descents of escaped European
indentured servants and other poor Whites "'for whom there was no place
in plantation society'" (Learning cited in Robinson, 1997, p. 13). In
fact, the very first maroon communities in the English colonies were
established by European indentured servants, with the practice being
overtaken by non-European-descended peoples as Indigenous American
genocide and African enslavement expanded. For nearly 200 years, then,
mixed-race, [**predominantly [Indigenous and Black]{.mark} American
[free communities existed]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the present-day states
of [Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana]{.mark}** []{.mark}at the same time that the
dominant sociopolitical systems of this region were primarily based on
racial segregation, enslavement, and Indigenous genocide]{.underline}.
[[**Virginia's Dismal Swamp**, **Florida's Gracia Real de Santa Teresa
de Mose**]{.underline}]{.mark} (likely an inspiration and a draw for
enslaved people even before Florida was taken by the United States),
[[and many, many other]{.mark} maroon communitie[s]{.mark} throughout
the Americas [stood as testaments to the fact that **another world was
possible**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a world in which the most oppressed
were able to **conduct their lives in peace, safety, and community
[without]{.mark} the constant threats of [bondage or
obliteration]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The above examples show that [such [collaborations]{.mark} repeatedly
[resulted in **sustained resistance to and survival despite**]{.mark}
**dominant [settler colonial repression]{.mark}** within the so-called
United States]{.underline}. **[These examples show us that the concept
of Black-Indigenism is not only not new, but has a rich, extensive
history of collaborations between Indigenous Americans and
Africans/African-descended peoples toward survival under
settler-colonial power]{.underline}**. [[While there are]{.mark}
unfortunate US [examples of Indigenous]{.mark} American [enslavement of
Blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}; [the [ostracizing]{.mark} of [peoples of
mixed]{.mark} Indigenous and Black American
[descent]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[and of Indigenous and Black]{.mark}
American [mistreatment]{.mark}, violence, policing, and capture [of each
other]{.mark} in service to the settler colonial project, **[it is
important to view these examples within the context of a society that
has required violence against and the enslavement]{.mark} and death of
American Indigenous and African/African-descended people from its
beginnings**]{.underline}. It is likely impossible for all people to
resist at all times, particularly when their survival or safety depends
on their not resisting, or when **[[a key strategy of the dominant
society is to pit groups against each other]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In the spirit of understanding ourselves as the *umma* that Wynter
describes, [we should acknowledge the pain that has been caused in our
shared history of division under colonial oppression]{.underline}.
[Then, we can look to the **[Black and Indigenous peoples]{.mark} in the
so-called US regions who [understood themselves as]{.mark} related and
[responsible for each other due to]{.mark} their [shared
struggle]{.mark} throughout the enslavement era, [if not]{.mark} due to
institutional or biological [familial ties]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[This [forging]{.mark} of [kinship]{.mark} networks [through both
abstract understandings and physical]{.mark} experiences of [struggle
caused effects in their material experiences]{.mark}, whether [in the
protection of bodies, homes, and food systems]{.mark}, or in the variety
of work]{.underline}** (including violent work) **[necessary to maintain
the freedoms of every person in the community]{.underline}** -- even
though some people may have otherwise been able to gain privileges from
the dominant oppressive society that their fellow community members
could not enjoy.

Finally, and, perhaps, [most importantly, **Wynter's concept of the
Word** is quite evident in our examples of Indigenous and Black
alliances in the US context]{.underline}. This is [because, while
different understandings of kinship networks and land/space were
integral to the work of these groups, **none of it would have been
possible without (1) a harkening back to Indigenous (American or
African) understandings of the Word-universes that named humanity and
humanness before the era of Western colonialism; and (2) a reimagining
of the Word-universes forced upon American Black and Indigenous peoples
by dominant Western powers**]{.underline}. Indeed, [while they resisted,
[Indigenous and Black peoples had to **remember, relearn, or recreate
linguistic abstractions that defined them as subhuman**]{.mark}**,
dangerous, savage, antagonistic, unintelligent, debased, and
uncivilized**]{.underline}. And [[while we may never know **how
effectively** they were able to do this, **the fact that they revolted**
]{.mark}**and resisted the dominant, pervasive, and knowledge-producing
colonizing power enough to revolt and resist [*at all* tells us that
they]{.mark} probably [remembered, re-learned, and re-created with at
least some success]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Further, [these people undoubtedly had to do all this remembering and
recreation, not only to resist what was around them, but **to create a
new (or, very, very old -- precolonial) way of being human despite any
clear precedents**]{.underline}. In Wynter's words, [[these maroons and
anti-slavery fighters had to]{.mark} **not only use new or reconfigured
definitions to understand their humanity**, but they had **to [imagine
*an entirely new way of being human and then be that*]{.mark} *-- [even
when there were precious few]{.mark} (if any) [examples]{.mark} on how
to do so***]{.underline}. [They could not depend on dominant ideologies
to define them, their lives, or how they should interact with peoples
different from them]{.underline}. [Rather, they used **their ability to
think abstractly**]{.underline} -- [to think **beyond their immediate
surroundings**]{.underline} -- [to **fight for or create freedom in a
context where, ostensibly, none was available to them**]{.underline}.
Or, at least, not enough to go around.

[In this under-recognized history, we are offered a glimpse into [**an
autopoetic model of decolonizing resistance** of **communal
possibilities where each groups' histories of oppression are
acknowledged and each group's**]{.mark} **freedom for
[self-determination is equally sought-after]{.mark} and
protected**]{.underline}. From excavating erased histories of joint
struggle, we can learn that We are stronger together. We are not alone
in this, but have the legacies of many brave fighters, thinkers, and
strategists at our backs.

#### Quality of life for arctic indigenous people has risen -- prefer statistics. 

**Poppel 17** (Birger Poppel, researcher of at Department of Culture and
Social History at the University of Greeland; 17; "Well-Being of
Circumpolar Arctic Peoples: The Quest for Continuity", : Estes, R.,
Sirgy, M. (eds) The Pursuit of Human Well-Being. International Handbooks

[The livelihood and living conditions of the indigenous peoples of the
Arctic have changed rapidly since World War II]{.underline}---the period
in history that has seen the largest immigration of newcomers.
Characterizing the development of the changes in the Arctic as "rapid"
is not a cliché. [**The indigenous peoples have**, generally speaking,
**proven to be both resilient and adaptive despite hardships** due to
injustices arising from a lack of social and cultural empathy from
colonial powers]{.underline}. In many regions, and through the different
arrangements they negotiated with the states they found themselves to be
citizens of, [indigenous peoples have managed largely to maintain
critically important aspects of their lifestyles, including close
relations to nature through subsistence use of the land water and their
living resources.]{.underline} Many indigenous peoples have also
succeeded in retaining their ancestral languages.

The indigenous people make up roughly 10 % of the total Arctic
population. A majority of the Arctic population are, from a historical
perspective, newcomers. All Arctic regions depend on exploitation of
natural resources (renewable and/ or nonrenewable), and all are impacted
by globalization and climate change. These impacts have resulted in
multifaceted challenges because the changes are intertwined with
demographic, socioeconomic, and sociocultural changes.

A key question, therefore, is how the changes have impacted the living
conditions and wellbeing of the indigenous and other residents of the
Arctic. A precondition for being able to answer this question is
developing relevant indicators to measure and compare human development.
Attempts to apply the conventional indicators of the HDI met with many
obstacles because of the lack of comparable official statistics for the
different Arctic jurisdictions. Furthermore, assessing individual
well-being and quality of life, as well as monitoring indicators
reflecting what is most important to indigenous and other Arctic
residents such as ties to nature, cultural continuity and vitality, and
control of destiny, is an even bigger challenge.

That being said, [**the more intense international focus on the
Arctic**, the **increased self-awareness of indigenous peoples**, and
their **creation of national and international organizations** as well
as the establishment of international collaborative entities such as the
Arctic Council **has resulted in a number of promising initiatives
focusing on human development in the circumpolar North**: the AHDR, the
Arctic Social Indicators, and the SLiCA.]{.underline}

The overall **[findings]{.underline}**, which are **[based on official
statistics]{.underline}**, **[indicate that]{.underline}**, generally
speaking, [**conditions have improved** during the first decade of the
twenty-first century **in physical health**]{.underline} ([measured by
infant mortality rate and years of life expectancy]{.underline}),
[**educational** **attainment**]{.underline} (measured by people with a
tertiary education), [**and** **income**]{.underline} (measured by GRP
per capita). The most recent figures and the actual rankings vary among
the different indicators, but [in recent decades **all Arctic regions
have experienced improvements** in physical health, education, and
economic well-being as measured by the HDI indicators.]{.underline} In
comparison, the overall mental health status of many indigenous
populations has suffered.

There are, however, huge differences between regions and between
population groups (especially indigenous and nonindigenous) within
regions. One expression of increased social suffering is the rapid rise
in the rate of death by suicide in several Arctic indigenous
populations, especially among young people.

Surveys comparing well-being among indigenous and nonindigenous groups
in Alaska and Arctic Canada confirm that nonindigenous residents rate
their individual well-being higher than indigenous residents do. [The
SLiCA focused on quality of life of Inuit, Sámi, and the indigenous
peoples of Chukotka and the Kola Peninsula and concluded that despite
facing social problems the majority of Inuit and Sámi were satisfied or
very satisfied with the quality of life in their community.]{.underline}
Among the indigenous people in the two Russian survey regions, the Kola
Peninsula and Chukotka, however, fewer than two out of ten were
satisfied with the quality of life in their community. Furthermore,
[**more than nine out of ten Inuit surveyed** in Greenland and Northern
Alaska, and also Swedish Sámi, **reported that they were satisfied** or
very satisfied **with their quality of life** as a whole.]{.underline}
The availability of fish and wildlife as well as the availability of
wage jobs were important explanatory factors, indicating that to these
indigenous residents a mixed lifestyle is still of utmost importance.

#### Geological climate modeling is key to solving climate change. Link turn: Indigenous peoples and communities benefit the most from studies of geology.

The USGS has a long history of researching, monitoring, and assessing
Earth's systems to understand the processes and basic science of the
climate cycle, its various physical and biotic components, and feedbacks
among the carbon cycle, hydrologic cycle, ecosystems, and land cover
changes. [[Monitoring]{.mark}, [modeling]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[prediction]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark} and its
associated impacts on ecosystems, landscapes, and resources [are]{.mark}
[critical]{.mark} [for]{.mark} identifying risks and vulnerabilities and
[preparing]{.mark} [for an uncertain future]{.mark}. This
[science]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [fundamental]{.mark} [for]{.mark} advancing
[risk assessments]{.mark} [and]{.mark} providing [climate science
tools]{.mark} [and]{.mark} support [services]{.mark} (fig. 1).
[Continued]{.mark} [research]{.mark} to better characterize how climate
change affects various components of Earth's systems [is critical
to]{.mark} [advancing]{.mark} [the ability]{.mark} of the USGS to
provide relevant science [to inform]{.mark} DOI land management
agencies, [industry]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} [public]{.mark},
[Tribes]{.mark}, and others [in]{.mark} [decision]{.mark}
[making]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [adaptation]{.mark} planning.]{.underline}
An improved understanding of climate change impacts to both natural and
human systems could allow the USGS to better pinpoint potential
vulnerabilities and to predict the potential effects of ongoing and
future climate change. For example, for fiscal years 2022--2024, the
USGS was tasked by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee
(2022) in its biennial implementation plan to collaborate on topics such
as (1) [delineating land cover change via remote sensing data products;
(2) [understanding the rate and impacts of terrestrial and subsea
permafrost degradation]{.mark}; (3) developing and assessing ice sheet
models for better prediction of sea-level rise; (4) improving
high-resolution capture of coastal processes; (5) synthesizing research
and monitoring needed to improve assessments of ecosystem processes and
feedbacks; (6) understanding the potential role of wildfire as a natural
and essential ecological process and driver of landscape change; (7)
assessing the effects of wildfire on natural and human communities and
global climate; (8) improving data delivery Investment in science
focused on understanding climate change impacts will enable more
effective preparedness for and response to amplified climate risks (such
as fire, drought, flooding, and permafrost changes)]{.underline}; in
turn, attenuating risks [will help to mitigate or reduce the short- and
long-term impacts on landscapes, species, people, and
infrastructure]{.mark}. Further, development of approaches to more
comprehensively monitor, report, and verify carbon and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions will enable better informed carbon mitigation programs,
guiding science-informed investment for both the U.S. Government and
private industry (U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2018).
Ultimately, the USGS will ensure that its science is available in a
timely fashion for actionable decision making and for applications by
other science agencies and nongovernmental partners. The goals and
recommendations for Priority 1 of the USGS Climate Science Plan support
the USGS commitment to characterizing climate change and associated
impacts. The strategies, impacts, and outcomes related to each goal for
Priority 1 are summarized in table 2.1. Goal 1: Conduct long-term,
broad-scale, and multidisciplinary measurements and monitoring and
research activities to define, quantify, and predict the impacts of
climate change on natural and human systems. The USGS should continue to
support integrated research---including measurements, monitoring, and
forecasts of climate change and its impacts on ecosystems and human
systems---at scales ranging from local to continental. This research
should have a particular focus on science approaches and tools that
allow for a better understanding of the feedbacks among the climate
system, changes in hazard risk, disturbances, and ecosystem patterns and
processes as well as the impacts of cascading and interacting natural
and anthropogenic stressors on human communities, ecosystems, and
species and their habitats. Goal 2: Provide leadership to standardize
measuring, monitoring, reporting, and verifying greenhouse gas
emissions, lateral carbon fluxes, and carbon sinks across lands managed
by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The USGS should improve methods
to estimate natural and anthropogenic GHG emissions, lateral carbon (C)
transfer, and biologic C sequestration domestically and internationally
as outlined in the "National Strategy to Advance an Integrated U.S.
Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System"
(Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Measurement Interagency Working Group,
2023). The Interagency Working Group recommended that the USGS be one of
several agencies tasked with understanding GHG emissions and sinks from
terrestrial systems and determining where targeted GHG monitoring
efforts would be most impactful. Further, the USGS should lead
development of a measuring, monitoring, reporting, and verifying (MMRV)
system for GHG emissions from wetlands (coastal blue carbon and other
wetlands), aquatic systems, grasslands, geologic sources (primarily coal
mines), and wildfires to include continued support from satellite-based
remote sensing through the Landsat Program
(https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/). Robust expertise and capacity for MMRV
are required for monitoring baseline conditions, including understanding
feedbacks of carbon cycle processes to climate change; measuring and
estimating carbon sequestration in vegetation, soils, and other
reservoirs; and verifying biologic and geologic carbon dioxide removal
and emissions reduction projects. Goal 3: [Provide science capacity,
training, tools, and infrastructure to Tribal partners; support
Tribal-led science initiatives. The USGS should [partner]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} [Tribal Nations to support]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[assist]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [Tribal]{.mark} climate science
[information]{.mark} and training needs [and]{.mark} [incorporate
Indigenous Knowledge in]{.mark} climate [science]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark} [co-production]{.mark}, when possible. The USGS
should advance Tribal priorities in the development of methodologies to
understand historical, long-term environmental change, traditional land
management practices and associated benefits, and potential climate
change impacts on Tribal land]{.underline}s. Goal 4: Conduct climate
change research in partnership with the broader climate science
community. The USGS should position itself as a key member of
interagency climate science groups such as the U.S. Global Change
Research Program (USGCRP), Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee
(IARPC), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), North
American Carbon Program (NACP), and Climate Change Interagency Working
Group (CCIWG). By participating and leading, the USGS can ensure that
appropriate Tribal and co-management partners are also involved and
aware. USGS research should strengthen collaboration with agency
partners and decision makers, such as the National Park Service (NPS),
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), and others.
Goal 5: Develop improved data synthesis methods through collaborative
and open science across mission areas and between the USGS and agency
partners. The USGS should continue to build on the strength of the John
Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis, the Center for Data
Integration, and other USGS entities that promote and support data
synthesis and other initiatives that openly share USGS data such that
integrated cross-scale and cross-disciplinary research can be used more
effectively. Priority 2---Assess Climate Change Risks and Develop
Approaches To Mitigate Climate Change The USGS vision is to translate
knowledge of climate change impacts into risk assessments, to integrate
monitoring and modeling of climate change impacts to improve forecasting
and decision support, and to incorporate all types of knowledge,
including western science and traditional, Indigenous Knowledge, into
climate change mitigation and adaptation approaches. In support of this
vision, goals 6--8 are described below. The strategies, impacts, and
outcomes related to each goal for Priority 2 are summarized in table 2.2
of appendix 2.

Problem Statement

[Improved management of natural and human systems depends on effective
monitoring of climate change impacts over time, understanding the risks
that climate change poses to natural and human systems, identifying
carbon cycle feedbacks on climate change, and determining solutions for
reducing risks, mitigating climate change, and adapting to impacts. To
provide actionable science, the USGS must extend knowledge of climate
change impacts (Priority 1) to understand the risks posed by those
impacts as well as unintended or indirect risks that could occur through
mitigation or adaptation strategies.]{.underline} Interactions among
climate change and hazards require that science and implementation be
conducted using an integrated systems-based approach. Monitoring and
assessment efforts are critical for informing risk reduction activities,
which encompass both mitigating climate change by reducing GHG emissions
and enhancing sinks as well as reducing the risks and impacts of climate
change to natural and human systems. In mitigating climate change, both
nature-based solutions and technological responses need to be evaluated
for co-benefit and risk tradeoffs (U.S. Department of the Interior,
2023). The USGS has the broad expertise required to lead efforts in the
development of risk assessments; models that evaluate the impacts of
resource management, mitigation, and adaptation strategies; forecasting
approaches; and early warning systems capable of identifying tipping
points in natural and human systems. These efforts can inform
communication products and decision tools to be developed for climate
services (Priority 3; fig. 1). Outcomes Characterizing the risk from
climate change impacts can equip DOI and its partners with the tools and
information to anticipate and mitigate the worst impacts of
climate-related hazards and to improve planning for long-term management
of natural resources. Further, [[science support for]{.mark} assessing
[adaptation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [mitigation]{.mark} [strategies]{.mark}
will [allow]{.mark} effective [incorporation of nature-based solutions
into restoration efforts,]{.mark} allowing DOI to maximize carbon
sequestration into its managed lands and waters. The [work]{.mark}
[conducted]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [support]{.mark} [of]{.mark} this
[priority]{.mark} [will]{.mark} also [provide]{.mark} scientific and
technological [assistance]{.mark} for the clean energy transition,
[helping]{.mark} to [avoid]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [worst]{.mark}
[impacts]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark} and improve
health outcomes]{.underline}.

### Apoc/Urgency Good\-\--1NC

#### The fact that multiple apocalypses already happened and others are ongoing [only strengthens]{.underline} the [ethical imperative to revolutionary struggle]{.underline} via engagement in mitigation policy debates\-\--it's the [work after "too late"]{.underline} that makes [every degree matter]{.underline}

**Moser 19** \[Susanne C. Moser, Environmental Studies Department,
Antioch University New England, "The work after "It\'s too late" (to
prevent dangerous climate change)," WIREs Climate Change, 11(1), Jan/Feb
2020, first published online 10-23-2019, DOI: 10.1002/wcc.606\]

To start, the IPCC\'s 1.5C of Global Warming report (IPCC, 2018) makes
one pause to reflect on its central scientific takeaways. It documents
not only the benefits of limiting global warming to 1.5 versus 2C but
also illustrates just how much momentum is built into the Earth system,
and thus how much the risks from climate change will grow even if
emissions ceased immediately. Moreover, it shows how drastic in pace and
scope the changes need to be to avoid overshooting the 1.5C and even 2C
targets.

But to also understand the cultural significance of this report, it is
important to look at the larger context. Consider, for example, the
widely reported Hothouse Earth article on tipping points in the Earth
system (Steffen et al., 2018); or the publication of the Deep Adaptation
paper (Bendell, 2018) having gone viral in the United Kingdom. It
infused further life into the kind of thinking introduced previously by
the Dark Mountain project (Kingsnorth & Hine, 2009). In the United
States, the Fourth US National Climate Assessment documented and
foretold in ever-grimmer terms the unfolding climate reality (USGCRP,
2018). Add to this recent science-based, but accessibly-written books
(e.g., Ghosh, 2016; Jarmail, 2019; Stephenson, 2015; Wallace-Wells,
2019) which -- while not all "popular" or reaching many millions1
---nevertheless reflect a growing sense of un-ease emerging beyond
scientific, environmentalist and deeply-informed policy circles.

[At least since Limits to Growth]{.underline} (Meadows, Meadows,
Randers, & Behrens III, 1972), [scientists have engaged in rich and
often heated debates and serious research on where possibly future
"limits," "thresholds," and "tipping points" in the Earth and human
systems might lie, how close we may be to them, and how one might avert
these thresholds and their consequences]{.underline} (Lenton, 2011,
2013; Meadows, Randers, & Meadows, 2004; Russill, 2015). Clearly related
and relevant but often explored in separate disciplines are [studies of
ecosystem and pre-historic societal collapse, often to warn against the
possibility of, again, future collapse of nations or
societies]{.underline} (Barnosky, Ehrlich, & Hadly, 2016; Butzer &
Endfield, 2012; Kareiva & Carranza, 2018; Scheffer, 2016). It is a far
more recent phenomenon that the scientific and science-based literature
ventures into the territory beyond limits as having been crossed already
or as being about to be crossed without the possibility of reprieve.
Heretofore, that territory was largely reserved for science fiction in
the secular realm (e.g., Feffer, 2016; Oreskes & Conway, 2014) and
theology in the religious (Walls, 2008). [What seems to be emerging
prominently now is a kind of "**scientific eschatology**," a
science-based end times literature that is **difficult to
dismiss**]{.underline}.

This article does not offer a simplistic answer to "is it too late -- or
not?" but rather launches from this premise of a culturally significant
moment wherein [a growing number of scientists and science-informed
public intellectuals insist with considerable certainty that humanity
has forced threshold crossings beyond which a step change in danger from
climate change exists, including that of **civilizational
collapse**]{.underline}. This emerging scientific chorus is met with
equal force from others, equally certain, that society will go on
unabated or that the evidence is unconvincing that any devastating
thresholds have been crossed. And if they have, they argue, the
implications can be handled with available or conceivable solutions
(e.g., Asafu-Adjaye et al., 2015; MacMartin, Ricke, & Keith, 2018).

In what follows, [I build on Donna Haraway\'s notion of "Staying with
the Trouble"]{.underline} (Haraway, 2016), [by which she means the
challenge of humans and non-humans learning to live and die together on
this damaged Earth and finding a way forward to livable
futures]{.underline}. Similarly, [I ask that we stay in the
uncomfortable space of **denying neither endings nor
possibilities**]{.underline}. [I ask that we witness and engage
with]{.underline} what appears like [a serious psychological and
cultural struggle]{.underline} within ourselves [over what and how to
confront endings, what kind of hope to sustain, and **how to be and
act** in the face of these **accumulating apocalyptic** (i.e.,
revelatory) **facts**]{.underline}. What should or can we apply
ourselves to at this stage of human residency on Planet Earth? This
article explores the matter at hand from this perspective.

2 \| RECOGNIZING, ACKNOWLEDGING, AND EMBRACING ENDINGS

2.1 \| At the threshold

Culturally, in the secularized, developed, privileged West and,
psychologically, for probably most individuals in that cultural context,
final limits and endings are difficult to embrace (Foster, 2015; Wolfe &
Tubi, 2019). [The history of the past 300 years (at least) can be read
as one of perpetual efforts by humans pushing back the physical limits
of nature with science and technology, to the point of believing that
there are none or at least no ultimate ones. These efforts were, and
still are, supported by a **cultural narrative** that has **enshrined
progress, limitless growth and material betterment** for humans as the
only rational, enlightened and politically acceptable goals while making
death and limits a cultural taboo]{.underline}.

Numerous writers have examined and criticized this evolution via
different analytical and disciplinary pathways and have come to see this
stance as the result of alienation from nature driven by existential
fears of death and insignificance (Becker, 1973; Dickinson, 2009;
Foster, 2015; Wuthnow, 2010). [**[Many suggest]{.mark}** that **[Western
society]{.mark}** ([and maybe **all** of **humanity**]{.mark})
[is]{.mark} currently [approaching **both symbolic and actual death**
and]{.mark} is either in its final decline (collapse) or---"if collapse
is not to be mere catastrophe unredeemed"]{.underline} (Foster, 2015,
p.117)---[[embarking on a]{.mark} profound **[transformative
process]{.mark}**. Such a transformation [would **end humanity\'s
life-destructive lifestyles and outdated underlying worldviews**
and]{.mark} associated values and come to **[adopt alternative habits of
mind]{.mark}** and behavior that restore and support life]{.underline}
(Berzonsky & Moser, 2017; Foster, 2015; Kingsnorth & Hine, 2009). This
line of argument is vehemently contested by various schools of thought,
which I will not engage deeply but ask, "what if it were so?"2

2.2 \| What if?

[[**Regardless** of whether the **current moment** is an **ultimate or
epochal ending**, and **regardless** of **how fast**]{.mark} it may
happen, [such a **transformative process would entail the end of
many**]{.mark} familiar and sometimes [**essential conditions for human
flourishing** or the **life that many (though not**]{.mark} **nearly
[all]{.mark}) have [enjoy]{.mark}ed in recent decades** and
more]{.underline} (Table 1).

Agreement is greater for "discontinuities" (as the sterile jargon goes)
in geophysical systems than for any in human-made systems or for human
civilization, much less the species, as a whole. Interestingly enough,
however, those having concluded that civilization and even the species
are at risk, have either left academia, fought attacks on their
credibility, or are viewed as scientific outsiders.3 The measured
habitus of academia does not permit anything but being careful with the
weight of scientific credibility, and scientists have paid a heavy price
if they expressed strong opinions or emotions.4 Regardless, if any of
the above are currently unfolding, embedded are two further endings:
that of the illusion of separation of humans from each other and from
their earthly habitat common in modern Western culture (e.g., Berzonsky
& Moser, 2017; Kasser, 2009; Pirages & Ehrlich, 1974), and an end of
innocence as none of us are spared that knowledge or its real-life

3 \| PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO ENDINGS

[Confrontation with impending actual or symbolic death can lead to
intensified efforts to resist, contest and deny the facts, and often
vitriolic arguments against the possibility of endings]{.underline} (for
a recent review see Wolfe and Tubi (2019)). Eventually, and

**\[\[ TABLE 1 OMITTED \]\]**

typically when there is no longer any other alternative, individuals may
come to accept the approaching death and engage actively in efforts to
bring unfinished aspects of their lives to a more satisfying closing.
For many, this time offers opportunities to reckon, heal, and come to
peace with past failings, wounds, and conflicts. It also often results
in a heightened sense of aliveness and gratitude for life and its gifts
(Kübler-Ross & Kessler, 2007; Weller, 2015).

In recent years, a growing scientific literature augmenting a much
longer-existent activist literature is recognizing emotional responses
to climate change as reflecting people fearing, recognizing, or actually
experiencing climate-related losses and endings. A variety of topics
have become subject of serious research:

• "Climate grief" (Cunsolo & Ellis, 2018; Cunsolo & Landman, 2017; Head,
2016; Marshall et al., 2019; Sale, 2011),

• "Solastalgia" (Albrecht et al., 2010; Askland & Bunn, 2018; Hutchings,
2014),

• "Anticipatory histories" as the work of mourning environmental losses
(DeSilvey, 2012; DeSilvey, Naylor, & Sackett, 2011),

• "Climate anxiety" or "eco-anxiety" (Findlater, Donner, Satterfield, &
Kandlikar, 2018; Pihkala, 2018; Scott & Weems, 2013), and

• Guilt, fear, and profound grappling with the meaning of what
scientists are saying (Cunsolo & Landman, 2017; Head & Harada, 2017;
Randall, 2009; Willox et al., 2013).

In this context, climate denial has become viewed by some through the
lens of Kübler-Ross\' "Stages of Grief" (KüblerRoss & Kessler, 2007;
Running, 2007; Wysham, 2012). Researchers take climate change seriously
not just as an inconvenience, occasional disruption or threat to
physical assets, ecosystems, livelihoods and lifestyles, but as an
existential threat.

This has opened the door to applications of trauma psychologies
(Woodbury, 2019) and existentialist psychologies (Langford, 2002; Wolfe
& Tubi, 2019). Meanwhile, the scientific and philosophical literature on
hope is witnessing a revival, in no small part because of the dire
prospects that climate change puts before us (Foster, 2015; Myers,
Nisbet, Maibach, & Leiserowitz, 2012; Ojala, 2012; Pihkala, 2017;
Wrangel, 2014).5

4 \| THE **[WORK AFTER "TOO LATE"]{.underline}**

But what should we or can we hope for? Shouldn\'t this paper now focus
on "possibilities," reassuring the reader that there are indeed
desirable ones? Shouldn\'t it give hope a shiny object to hold on to?
Not only because of word limitations but on rhetorical and practical
grounds, no such section is included here. Readers might argue that
positive and utopian visions exist, while others might point to possible
achievements and improvements even if they seem utterly too small and
too specific (and thus too certain) to satisfy the transformational
imperative of the situation. [**To stay true to a genuine
transformation**, the **ultimate outcomes cannot be known**, even though
it is part of the cultural work of this time to foster the individual
and collective imagination and jointly explore what may be
possible]{.underline} (Moser, 2019). [More importantly, **the
[unfolding]{.mark} of [positive possibilities depends entirely on the
transformational work that must be done]{.mark}** in the midst of a
rapidly changing Earth system]{.underline} (Berzonsky & Moser, 2017).
Thus, the focus in the remainder of this article is on that work.

4.1 \| Politics and policy-making after "too late"

The work cited above reveals that---at least in some publics---there is
an awareness of unfolding or anticipated endings. Some are beginning to
grapple with and/or experiencing psychological impacts on their
perceived well-being. Associated emotions are processed largely in
private (often in isolation), in the privacy of counseling rooms, in
support groups, and when in public in shouting matches, blogosphere
battles, and political diatribes. [In the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [in particular]{.underline}, but likely
elsewhere in the West/North and in countries attempting to rise from the
shackles of colonialism and poverty, [publicly embracing "too late" is
culturally and politically unacceptable. Traditionally, winning
political platforms are not built on lost opportunities, closing windows
and abysmal outlooks]{.underline}.

Regarding day-to-day politics then, **[the work [after "too
late"]{.mark} in many ways is to constructively navigate this cultural
taboo]{.underline}**. Again, I relegate the various (and still-dominant)
versions of avoidance of doing that work to a footnote and instead
remain focused on those who are "staying with the trouble" that arises
from accepting that some things are "too late" even if we do not know
what all that implies.6 [True **[political leadership is to]{.mark} name
the endings** and **[frame the transformational imperative and
arc]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Moser, 2019). Barnett (2017) warns, however,
against pre-maturely declaring endings, thus **[calling on leaders [to
hold precisely that tension between]{.mark}]{.underline}** paralyzing
and **[[demotivational certainties and grounded hope for]{.mark} unknown
[possible futures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Adequate leadership means not
to offer easy answers to the question of possibilities but to inspire a
search for them, explore them and create them together. Ultimately, it
means risking one\'s political life to help electorates come to embrace
difficult choices.

4.2 \| **[Mitigation as if every degree mattered]{.underline}**

The growing climate justice and youth movements pressing for
comprehensive climate action (e.g., Extinction Rebellion, Greta Thunberg
and the school strikes, 350.org, and other local-but-globally-networked
climate justice campaigns) point their fingers at the moral failure of
"business-as-usual" avoidance responses (e.g., O\'Brien, Selboe, &
Hayward, 2018). With cleareyed recognition of the late hour, for them it
is a David versus Goliath matter of engaged future-making, a refusal to
give up on the possibility of life even now, and as such a moral choice
in the face of great danger but also deep unknowability of exactly what
will unfold.

This **[[engaged future-making]{.mark} among those accepting a vastly
curtailed possibility of ever having a future at all [occurs mostly in
the context of movement-building for radical policy
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It involves voicing bold, blunt, and
creative wake-up calls, often perceived as offensive by traditional
standards7 ; **[[broadening coalitions for
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**; engaging increasingly in civil
disobedience; and investing in and fostering the conditions for
innovation. **[[Rather than engaging in]{.underline}]{.mark}**
black-and-white, **[[all-or-nothing thinking]{.mark}, demands for
mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are shifting to a notion of ["every
degree matters," which does not permit complacency at
all]{.mark}]{.underline}** as temperature and CO2 concentration
milestones are being passed and the temptation of despair grows larger.

Responsibilities" 3/6/24
https://latitude.plos.org/2024/03/the-urgency-of-climate-change-mitigation-and-individual-responsibilities/)//conway

**[[Climate change is not a distant threat; it]{.mark} is an imminent
crisis that [demands our immediate attention.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Planetary warming and extremes thus far have already impacted \~5
billion people. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6
reports paint a stark picture of our planet's future if we fail to act.
They present a call to arms, **[[a call to recognise]{.mark} the
[urgency]{.mark} of mitigating climate change and for each of us to play
our part in safeguarding the world we inhabit]{.underline}.** Rising
greenhouse gas emissions [Global greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark} have
[continued to rise]{.mark}, primarily [due to human activities]{.mark}
such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial processes,
waste, and agricultural practices. Despite some promising efforts in
emissions reductions by a few nations, [the overall trend is deeply
concerning.]{.mark} **We stand at a critical juncture where the
consequences of o[ur action, or inaction, will define the future]{.mark}
of our planet.**]{.underline} The AR6 reports make it abundantly clear
that we are on a trajectory to exceed the 1.5°C target, a threshold
beyond which catastrophic climate impacts become increasingly likely.
[The present 1.2°C climate reveals increasing vulnerability of major
planetary systems, particularly ice sheets and oceans, and an increasing
frequency and intensity of extreme heat, heavy precipitation, droughts,
and intensification of major hurricanes. **[The urgency cannot be
overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although there are challenges The AR6
Working Group III report outlines various mitigation pathways,
demonstrating that it is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5°C
if we take immediate and sustained action. The pathways involve
transitioning from fossil fuel-based energy systems to low-carbon
alternatives, scaling up renewable energy sources, enhancing energy
efficiency, and reducing reliance on fossil fuels across multiple
sectors. However, the 1.5°C target may necessitate removal of carbon
dioxide alongside reduced emissions from sectors such as transportation,
industry, and land use. A 1.5°C climate target may require carbon
dioxide removal (CDR) of about 500 Gt CO2 within the 21st century with
negative CO2 emission technologies (NETs). The AR6 reports also draw
attention to the top 1% and top 10% of the global population, primarily
the wealthiest individuals and nations, responsible for a
disproportionately large share of global greenhouse gas emissions. This
disparity is due to industrial activities, consumption patterns and
energy-intensive lifestyles, concentrated mainly among the wealthier
nations. This emissions disparity contributes to both climate and social
injustice by placing a heavier burden on the poorest and most vulnerable
communities. The AR6 reports therefore advocate equity in climate action
so that mitigation efforts address the emission gaps without ignoring
the issue of social justice. However, the fault line between mitigation
ambition and equity reflects the complex dynamics of international
climate negotiations. Developed countries often emphasize the need for
ambitious mitigation targets and actions, while developing countries
argue for climate justice and equity considerations governed by levels
of responsibility for historical emissions based on the principle of
common but differentiated responsibilities. The varying national
interests and priorities have led to a tension between mitigation
ambition and equity considerations, thus making it increasingly
challenging to reach a consensus in addressing climate change. For
instance, COP27 faced similar challenges in achieving consensus and
tangible results on the issue of mitigation and enhancing ambition to
keep 1.5°C alive. Despite the complex climate negotiation challenges, it
is heartening to see that equity concerns were central to climate
negotiations at COP27 and COP28, which is a significant development. The
pivotal role of individuals in mitigation efforts The AR6 reports
emphasise demand-side approaches to mitigation by stressing the need for
behavioural and lifestyle changes for sustainable consumption and
production. These demand-side strategies have significant potential to
reduce emissions by 40-70% by 2050. Changes in consumption patterns,
behaviours, and lifestyles can significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Individuals can be powerful agents of change by making
conscious choices, adopting sustainable practices, and reducing their
carbon footprints. The message that the reports deliver is that
individuals are not passive observers in this climate crisis but active
participants and agents to make a difference. Every action, no matter
how small, counts. For example, it is about choosing public
transportation over personal vehicles, reducing meat consumption,
conserving water and energy, and supporting sustainable products and
businesses. It is also about advocating policies that prioritise
renewable energy over non-renewables and adopting sustainable practices
over unsustainable lifestyles. The figure below highlights the critical
role of individuals and the demand-side actions that consumers and
businesses can initiate. Such action can help change our planet's
current trajectory towards climate change mitigation whilst ensuring
climate justice. It emphasises the interconnectedness of individual
actions, consumption patterns, and the broader goal of addressing the
climate crisis equitably. [However, evidence also suggests that some do
not perceive climate change as an imminent crisis that demands immediate
attention. For instance, some individuals may reduce their support for
climate action in immediate crises as they prioritise addressing the
direct threat over a perceived distant threat. **[People]{.mark} often
[perceive]{.mark} climate change [as a distant threa]{.mark}t that does
not personally affect them, [which]{.mark} can [lead to a lack
of]{.mark} personal relevance and [motivation to act.]{.mark}**
Furthermore, some individuals resist climate change messages and are
still waiting to make the necessary investments and sacrifices to
respond to the threat despite acknowledging that climate change is
caused by humans. **But [it is important to realise]{.mark} that [the
longer we postpone action]{.mark} to mitigate climate change, [the more
challenging it will be]{.mark} to address them, and we will face the
brunt of the severe consequences, such as increased heatwaves, droughts,
flooding, and food insecurity.**]{.underline}

Three of the five are related to our relationship with nature and the
climate: environmental damage, climate change and society's inability to
respond to environmental risks. They reflect the results of the Global
Risk Report this year and **[[highlight the gravity of our current
situation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Low-latitude coral reefs are just one
of 16 climate tipping points. [Five important natural thresholds already
risk being crossed, according to the recently released Global Tipping
Points report, and three more may be reached in the 2030s if the world
heats 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures.]{.underline} Indeed, six
of our nine planetary boundaries have been transgressed, and our window
of action to maintain a safe and just pathway is vanishingly small.
**[[Humanity is facing an existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
the ability of life -- including human life -- to survive.
**[[Maintaining optimism we can and will succeed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
We are both the species that caused the climate crisis and [we are

one of the biggest challenges and opportunities of our time. **[[When

reality we are facing.]{.mark} [Not doing so, leads decision-makers to a
misguided perception]{.mark} of the problem [and]{.mark} so [poorly
crafted]{.mark}, short term and often linear
[solutions.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On the other hand, maintaining a
fixed focus on the threat leaves the human psyche with a trauma response
of fight, flight, freeze and fold -- inducing inaction and propelling
rather than mitigating risk. In the words of James Stockdale, who faced
his own existential crisis in a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam: "You
must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end --- which you
can never afford to lose --- with the discipline to confront the most
brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be." He
observed that those prisoners who were too optimistic without
understanding their reality died because they got discouraged. So did
those caught in a trauma response of inaction. The small group of
prisoners who survived managed to pair a fully informed perspective with
unconditional optimism. Pathways towards a better future The World
Economic Forum's Centre for Nature and Climate launches today Earth
Decides, a community of 35 world-class experts and influencers looking
to cultivate informed optimism among public, private and philanthropic
leaders. [[By understanding the hard truths]{.mark} of our reality, [and

a better future]{.mark} than our current status quo, [we move towards a

responses and form hitherto unprecedented collaborations to address the
realities of this wicked problem.]{.underline}

### Anthropocene Frame Bad

**Using the Anthropocene to frame the climate crisis relies on
hierarchical assumptions that make warming inevitable and turn the AFF**

Island, Erim Ergene, College of Business, Bryant University, Subhabrata

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-024-05723-x, \[SG\])

However, [[the concept of the Anthropocene reinforces]{.mark} the
assumption of [human domination over nature]{.mark}, which is
[responsible for]{.mark} the ecological [crises]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline} (Crist, 2013; Ergene & Calás, 2023). [The [illusion
of human]{.mark} [exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline} is a dangerous one
because it [continues to privilege technical solutions]{.underline} for
managing ecological crises (Calás et al., 2018). [**The Anthropocene
concept [also reproduces]{.mark} and consolidates [colonial
structures]{.mark} of power while reproducing [Eurocentric
understandings of human nature]{.mark}**, where being human in
Enlightenment reasoning inevitably meant white, male
European]{.underline} (Simpson, 2020).

[[Feminist scholars]{.mark} have [problematized the "Anthropos]{.mark}"
at the center of the concept of the Anthropocene]{.underline} arguing
that [it is [the figure]{.mark} of [the universal "Man]{.mark}" that has
brought us to the brink of ecological disaster]{.underline} (Ergene et
al., 2018; Glabau, 2017; Haraway, 2016). **[The "Anthropos" [has never
been]{.mark} a [neutral]{.mark} term [but]{.mark} is [a
normative]{.mark} [category that grants privileges]{.mark} and
entitlements [to gendered and racialized bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Braidotti, 2019). Specifically, [this figure of the Anthropos
"monopolizes the right to access to bodies of all living
entities"]{.underline} (Braidotti, 2019, p. 39) [by [normalizing a
"cis-male]{.mark}, individuated, [Eurocentric
subject]{.mark}]{.underline} that has, historically, overlooked the
lives of women" (Sayers et al., 2021, p.3). Grounded in feminist
epistemological questions of "Whose science? Whose knowledge?" (Harding,
1991) and situated knowledges (Haraway, 1988), [feminists have also
challenged [the premise of "panhuman" responsibility underlying the
Anthropocene discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}. These scholars argue that
[a universal "we" [ignores]{.mark} deep [inequities]{.mark} between the
privileged few who have benefited from centuries of fossil-fuel driven
development that has created the ecological crisis, and historically
marginalized populations who have contributed the least to the problem,
but from whom the Anthropocene demands equal accountability]{.underline}
(Di Chiro, 2016).

While [[I would **dispute**]{.mark} that [**any** single structure,
**event**, or **process** created]{.mark} the **[Anthropocene]{.mark}**,
as [one of]{.mark} the [most **profound**]{.mark}]{.underline} social
relations shaping the modern world, it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
difficult to believe that **[[racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** has not
played a part. Abundant research indicates that not only do many
environmental hazards follow along racial lines, but also many of the
meta- processes that have contributed to the Anthropocene, such as
industrialization, urbanization, and capitalism, are racialized. I argue
that [[the **Anthropocene**]{.mark} must be seen as a
**racial**]{.underline} process. [[Certainly it is **not solely** a
racial process]{.mark}--- [that would be a gross
**overstatement**]{.mark}--- but it has **played** an important
**role**]{.underline} in both producing it and in determining who lives
and dies. I examine how racism is embedded in the Anthropocene by
focusing on several key issues: the evidence of racially uneven
vulnerability and death; the form of racism at work; our general
inability to acknowledge it; and the importance of history in coming to
terms with the racial dimensions of the Anthropocene. [I
conclude]{.underline} by arguing [that the racially
**uneven**]{.underline} geography of [death from the **Anthropocene**
should be **understood** as a]{.underline} contemporary [form of
primitive **accumulation**]{.underline}.

While the Anthropocene is a broad term that denotes diverse forms of
human impact on the planet, I pay particular attention to global
warming. As the centerpiece of the Anthropocene, it has received by far
the most attention and thus is the logical place to analyze how racism
is, or is not, understood in the Anthropocene.

The Evidence: The Geography of Racial Vulnerability

Some might refute the idea that global warming has anything to do with
race. After all, climate change is affecting the entire planet.
Moreover, the state powers seeking to respond to climate change, such as
the Conference of Parties (COPS), include global representation. Yet,
when we look at who will pay the greatest cost, in terms of their lives,
livelihoods, and well- being, it is overwhelmingly, to borrow a recently
revived term from Vijay Prashad (2007), the "darker nations." While some
may believe these are random patterns or accidents of geography, climate
justice activists understand that they result from deep historical
processes. They recognize that the rich, industrialized countries, which
are disproportionately white, will escape with vastly fewer deaths. This
is not due to any kind of racial animus but, in addition to historical
processes, it is the result of a particular form of widespread
contemporary racism, indifference.

It is a truism that we will all be impacted by the Anthropocene, but we
will experience it differently. As Andrew Ross (2011) notes, there are
those who will merely be inconvenienced and there are those who will
die . . . with numerous positions between these two extremes. Those
experiencing inconvenience will confront higher prices for food, energy,
and water, as well as the discomfort of extreme heat as we transport
ourselves from one air- conditioned environment to another. Others will
have to contend with the loss of their homes, as the land on which they
live is swallowed by rising sea levels, forcing them to move elsewhere.
Still, others will find that their resource base can no longer sustain
them and will have to migrate in search of a different land base or,
more likely, a job in an overcrowded city. And then there are those who
will simply die. Since 1990 more than 20,000 people have died from heat
in India, culminating in May 2015 when over 2,500 died in a single
month. In addition to dying from heatstroke and heat exhaustion, people
will die from their inability to tolerate migration, hunger, thirst, and
disease.

This differential vulnerability in terms of the haves and the have- nots
is acknowledged by many, but the role of racism is generally overlooked.
However, even a cursory glance indicates that it is overwhelmingly
places occupied primarily by nonwhite peoples that will pay the highest
price for global warming: death. The evidence for the uneven and unfair
distribution of death is overwhelming. Figure 7 presents two different
maps that highlight the uneven geographies of death from global warming.
The top map depicts carbon emissions by country. What stands out is the
bloated nature of the United States and Western Europe, and the
contracted size of Africa. The bottom map shows estimated deaths
produced by four likely health consequences associated with global
warming: malaria, malnutrition, diarrhea, and inland flood- related
fatalities. In this map we see the opposite: the Global North is greatly
shrunk, while both Africa and parts of Asia explode.

Even within the wealthy parts of the world, the spatial distribution of
risk, vulnerability, and death follows along pre- existing lines of
racial inequality. In the United States, for example, researchers have
found that the urban poor, which are overwhelmingly nonwhite, will die
at the highest rates because of a lack of air conditioning. In places
like California, which are leading the way in terms of climate
mitigation, researchers have found that the "Cap and Trade" program,
which encourages industries and firms to reduce carbon emissions over
time via an emissions market, has resulted in greater concentrations of
air toxins for communities of color, thereby intensifying the
environmental racism that already shapes California cities (Cushing et.
al. 2016). Seen another way, Latinas/os and African Americans are
subsidizing California's efforts to reduce global warming with their
lives.

Disproportionate vulnerability can also be seen in indigenous
communities, which are increasingly being called "frontline
communities." Because they are land- based people, their livelihoods and
way of life are extremely vulnerable to the Anthropocene, including
species loss and change, flooding, and drought. Scholars such as Kyle
Powys Whyte (2017) have argued that indigenous people are already living
in dystopia, if one considers the ecological and social devastation of
colonization, and that global warming is a continuation of a centuries-
long apocalypse. Indeed, the ongoing nature of settler colonialism is
evident in the fossil- fuel industry, which, assisted by states,
continues to target these lands for extractive activities. Building on
centuries of dispossession, these lands are often treated as "available"
for taking by white settlers. Likewise, polluters and their fossil- fuel
allies have long assumed that native peoples are weak and lack the
political capacity to challenge them in a meaningful way. As a result,
indigenous communities and their allies are engaged in intense battles
across the Américas, from Canada to Peru. These communities not only
wish to protect their lands, some of which are sacred, but also realize
that continuing to extract and transport fossil fuels will place their
communities and the entire planet in a more precarious position.

Evasion and Indifference

As previously noted, global leaders are well aware of the racial
geography of the Anthropocene and have chosen not to act. Naomi Klein
(2014), the only pundit who regularly discusses climate change as
racial, recalls when the racist dimensions of our global strategy became
painfully obvious. At the close of the United Nations climate summit in
Copenhagen in December 2009, governments agreed to a global temperature
increase of two degree Celsius. It was thought that two degrees would
prevent global catastrophe. However, it was fully understood that two
degrees would eliminate some island states and be absolutely disastrous
for much of Africa. This is key: knowingly allowing large swaths of
nonwhite, mostly poor people to die. Could we have decided to do
otherwise? Yes. But as a global community we have declined to prevent
this massive die-off. In response, a group of African delegates
expressed their outrage, protesting: "We will not die quietly," "Two
degrees is suicide," "1.5 to Survive," and "Death sentence for Africa."
The delegates were not about to go quietly and wanted to ensure that
everyone was aware of the import of their actions. This moment
illuminated the racial geography of global warming, our lack of
political will, our disregard for nonwhite and poor lives, and the
deeply immoral nature of the Anthropocene. Since then, we have failed to
even meet the goal of two degrees and are on target for four to six
degrees Celsius temperature rise.

Given that our global leaders have condemned millions of people to
death, [[we have to ask **"why?"**]{.underline}]{.mark} How are we able
to make such a decision? Many would argue that the [[rich
**countries**]{.mark} simply [**do not** want to pay]{.mark} the
additional [**costs** of]{.mark} protecting and/or [helping]{.mark}
vulnerable [**countries**. **Certainly this is
true**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Few rich countries want their wealth
siphoned off elsewhere, especially to nonwhite, poor places. This would
result in fewer funds for domestic spending and the potential wrath of
voters. It is uncertain how much political and moral capital it would
generate in the global arena. As morally reprehensible as this may be,
it is understandable. It's about money and power. We live in a
capitalist world economy that places a premium on economic self-
interest. But sentencing millions to die requires more explanation than
simply economic self- interest. Such a powerful act requires an equally
powerful ideology, as noted in the epigraph. And that is racism.

The global landscape of [[**racism** is]{.mark} vast and
**[varied]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The practice of [racism]{.underline}
and our understanding of it [[**evolves** over time]{.underline}]{.mark}
and at any given moment multiple forms of racism are operating. [The
[**racism** that undergird **slavery**]{.mark} and colonization [is

**[Anthropocene]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [During]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the **[conquest]{.mark}** of the Américas]{.underline}, Europeans
questioned whether Native Americans had souls, while [[Africans]{.mark}
were **[considered]{.mark}** to be a **[lower]{.mark}** form of
[humanity. Over]{.mark} the [centuries, through
**decol**]{.mark}**onization**, the [dismantling]{.mark} of [**slavery**
and **apartheid**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [development of [human
**rights**, civil rights **movements**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} other
forms of [[antiracist struggle, racism]{.mark} has
**[changed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Overt violence, legalized racial
subordination, and racial animus have largely, although not entirely,
been replaced by seemingly less intense, deliberate, and overt forms of
racism.

Far more significant today is the indifference that characterizes the
attitudes, practices, and policy positions of much of the Global North
toward those destined to die. This indifference is a form of racism,
because not only does it serve to reproduce racial inequality, but also
this inequality enables the well- being of those destined to live. Ruth
Wilson Gilmore defines racism as the "exploitation of group
differentiated vulnerabilities to premature death in distinct yet
densely interconnected political geographies" (2007, 28). Given this
definition, while more than indifference was needed to create the
conditions that produced such racially differentiated vulnerability, it
is maintained by indifference. Like all other racisms, indifference is
based on a devaluation of nonwhite lives and an overvaluation of white
ones. We must recall that racism is first and foremost a relationship of
power between two groups; it is not unidirectional. Thus, many in the
Global North might assume the current valuation of white lives is the
norm. But, as Lisa Cacho (2012) insists, racism is fundamentally a
differential valuation. The devaluation of one group is predicated on
the overvaluation of the other. While on the one hand, this may be
obvious, on the other, many are hesitant to accept this basic truth.
This general reticence can be seen in the slogan "Black Lives Matter" in
which activists feel the need to proclaim the value of Black lives
because they are so routinely devalued. Even the Gates Foundation,
hardly a bastion of radical antiracist struggle, claims as part of its
mission statement, "All lives have equal value." Again, they are
responding to the general devaluation by the Global North of the lives
of the Global South, where the foundation does much of its work. It is
understandably difficult to accept the fact that we value lives
differently--- as this is contrary to contemporary human rights values,
as well as the idea of racial progress. As a result, one of the primary
responses to this contradiction is evasion, as we consistently seek to
avoid addressing race.

Both evasion and indifference are visible in the objects and essays
assembled in the Cabinet of Curiosities. While numerous essays
acknowledge the uneven geography of the Anthropocene, there is little
systematic analysis of racism. Several essays appearing in this volume
readily acknowledge the historical significance of colonization,
including Julianne Lutz Warren's "Huia Echoes," Trisha Carroll and Mandy
Martin's Davies Creek Road, and Josh Wodak's "Artificial Coral Reef."
Others gesture to the environmental injustice that Mexican farm workers
experience with pesticides, but only one essay, Bethany Wiggin's
analysis of the "Germantown Calico Quilt," seriously analyzes
colonization and slavery. This is one out of fifteen essays. In
contrast, a more common theme is to show how we all contribute to the
Anthropocene, as seen, for example, in the wonderful story of concretes,
or in essays in which the agent is never fully articulated. It is not my
intent to critique the various authors, but rather to underscore the
extent to which they reflect the larger dynamic of avoiding a serious
engagement with racism. I appreciate the need and desire to highlight
the fact that we are all active participants in the Anthropocene, but
the lack of deep interrogation of one of the key inequalities shaping
the geography of the Anthropocene must be pointed out. While some may
argue that introducing racism into the discussion may create more
problems than it solves--- and it would create problems--- it is
essential that we account for all the processes that have contributed to
the Anthropocene. Ideally, this volume would contain a healthy tension
between the universalizing aspects of the Anthropocene, as seen by the
concrete play, and by the specific dynamics responsible for the map
presented in figure 7.

Besides our general desire to avoid acknowledging racism, there are
genuine challenges to "seeing" race in the Anthropocene. One of the most
important is the fact that over the last several decades a growing
number of the "darker nations" have become major carbon emitters. The
clearest example of this is China, which is currently the biggest
emitter of carbon in the world. India is the third- largest emitter,
largely due to its sheer population size. However, the emissions of both
of these countries are relatively recent, exploding since 2000, and
their per capita emissions are relatively low. For example, according to
World Bank data, India's per capita carbon emissions is 1.7 metric tons,
while Luxembourg's is 20.9. Such facts preclude drawing any clear racial
lines in terms of emitters and victims. Yet, there are undeniable
patterns in which the most vulnerable countries are overwhelmingly
nonwhite.

Another challenge to seeing racism in the Anthropocene is the fact that
in much of the world conceptions of racism have been constricted in
order to minimize its perceived impact. Diverse strategies are employed
to deny that racism is still a force in shaping the contemporary world,
but what they all have in common is that they are predicated on
decoupling race and larger material relations. This disconnection, Jodi
Melamed (2011) argues, has facilitated restructuring conceptions of
racism to fit particular political needs. It is the refusal to connect
racially uneven outcomes with dominant attitudes, beliefs, practices,
and structures that allows us to deny any possible connection between
racism and the Anthropocene. Indeed, some ridicule the idea. For
instance, the right- wing Breitbart News found it laughable that the
Guardian sought to make a connection between racism and climate change
(Williams 2016):

> The "reasoning" behind the outlandish hypothesis runs something like
> this. Begin with the unprovable premise that "Britain is the biggest

> the 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change are in sub- Saharan
> Africa." Climate change has just become a racial issue, wrought by
> selfish white people on unsuspecting blacks.

This quote invokes several mainstream strategies to delegitimize any
effort to see the Anthropocene in racial terms. First, implicit is the
assumption that racism is a conscious, hostile act. The author contracts
the conception of racism so that other widely acknowledged forms of
racism, such as white privilege or indifference, are irrelevant. Second,
at work is a deeply ahistorical understanding of racism and, indeed, the
world. Those who wish to avoid grappling with the legacies of previous
racial formations, especially those based on more overt forms of white
supremacy and violence, are deeply invested in ahistoricism. Countries
like the United States, for instance, have developed numerous ideologies
to defend the current social arrangement precisely in order to avoid
acknowledging the racist past and its reverberations. Available
ideologies include meritocracy, color blindness, multiculturalism, and
postracialism, what Melamed has collectively called "state anti-
racisms." Their power, she insists, lies in their ability to convince
the general population that meaningful racial progress is being made,
while simultaneously masking the violence of the contemporary racial
order--- which is precisely what is happening in the Anthropocene.

Historicizing Racism and Primitive Accumulation

While the Anthropocene is generally viewed as a potential catastrophe,
one silver lining is that it forces us to reckon with history. This, in
turn, provides an opportunity to reconsider the role of racism in
shaping the present. Scientists have spent years deliberating when, if
at all, the Anthropocene era should begin. In August 2016 the
Anthropocene Working Group of the International Geological Congress
announced its support for the formal recognition of the Anthropocene.
While the Working Group proposed 1950 as one possible date when the era
should begin, the question itself has launched a multitude of research
initiatives to determine the appropriate marker, also known as the
"golden spike." This is a deeply historical exercise. Regardless of what
event or year is adopted as a marker, it is the deliberations themselves
that are crucial as they offer an opportunity to revisit and reinterpret
our collective past, and to hopefully come to a more honest accounting
of how it is that we have created both the Anthropocene and its racial
geography. As Gary Kroll notes in this volume, "the Anthropocene is less
a geological epoch than it is a story."

Various dates and events have been suggested as a starting point,
including the invention of the steam engine, human manipulation of fire,
the Industrial Revolution, the plutonium fallout of the nuclear age, and
the Great Acceleration of the 1950s. Each of these events offers a
window into a whole series of racial dynamics that must be analyzed in
order to ascertain the role of racism. In "Defining the Anthropocene,"
Lewis and Maslin (2015) offer two possible dates, 1610 and 1964. I would
like to briefly explore 1610 because it allows us to confront the racist
dimensions of the Anthropocene as seen through colonization, conquest,
and primitive accumulation.

The authors chose 1610 because it marks European conquest and
colonization of the Américas, one of the most singular events in human
history. They cite two profound changes associated with 1610:
transcontinental range expansion and a decline in carbon emissions.
Transcontinental range expansion is evident in the spread of American
species, namely corn, into Eurasia and Africa, as well as the transport
of "Old World" species, such as bananas, to the Américas. This range
expansion, while seemingly benign, both produced and was produced by a
profound set of biologic, ecologic, and social changes.

The second major event associated with 1610 is a drop in atmospheric
carbon dioxide. This was due to massive death in the Américas. Between
1492, when Columbus set sail, and 1650, it is estimated that
approximately 50,000,000 people died in the Américas. This unprecedented
die- off of humans resulted in a major decrease in farming, including a
reduction in the use of fire for habitat modification. As a result,
carbon was not released into the atmosphere through farming and other
soil disruptions, ultimately resulting in a decrease in carbon
emissions.

The "Columbian Encounter," as some euphemistically call it, is one of
the most significant events in human history and led to vast economic,
social, political, and ecological changes, including the previously
mentioned dystopia for indigenous peoples. Lewis and Maslin's analysis,
while certainly not intended to be political, illustrates that there is
no escaping the political and power dynamics that have contributed to
the Anthropocene. And though they never mention it, racism is a crucial
feature of the events of 1610. One may wish to debate the merits of
conquest and colonization, but there is little doubt that they relied on
lethal force, state capacity, and a racial ideology of white supremacy.
Despite whatever rosy stories we may tell ourselves, conquest was a
bloody, violent affair. As Roxanne Dunbar- Ortiz reminds us, "people do
not hand over their land, resources, children and futures without a
fight" (2014, 8). The fact that most people died from disease rather
than gunshot does not erase the racist dimensions of colonization.
Indeed, colonists continued to wage war and genocide even after
90 percent of the population had been decimated. Nor can we lose sight
of why Europeans were there in the first place--- to conquer and claim
the Américas, employing such self- serving legal justifications as papal
bulls and the Doctrine of Discovery.

Contemporary Indigenous studies scholars, such as Jodi Byrd (2011), have
pointed out that there are important distinctions between colonization
and racism. For example, most antiracist activists desire inclusion,
while decolonial activists desire autonomy and decolonization. Despite
these distinctions, there is no escaping the fact that racism informs
colonization. To claim another people's land as your own upon arrival;
to kidnap people and force them into slavery or peonage and build an
elaborate supporting apparatus; to eradicate another people's way of
life; to steal the wealth and resources of another nation--- these are
breathtaking acts that require a powerful ideology to justify them. Such
a sense of entitlement ultimately rests on a deep sense of superiority.

To understand how racism was harnessed for colonization, and
subsequently capitalism, I draw on Cedric Robinson's concept of racial
capitalism. Increasing numbers of critical ethnic studies scholars have
begun challenging conventional Marxian analysis, which treats racism as
incidental or, at the most, as an ideology to keep workers divided.
Instead, Robinson (2000) argues that racism has been a constituent force
of capitalism from the very beginning. Lisa Lowe, building on Robinson,
explains, "the term racial capitalism captures the sense that actually
existing capitalism exploits through culturally and socially constructed
differences such as race, gender, region, and nationality, and is lived
through those uneven formations; it refutes the idea of a 'pure'
capitalism external to or extrinsic from, the racial formation of
collectivities and populations" (2015, 150).

Seen in this way, racism informs contemporary capitalism and its
antecedents, including primitive accumulation. For Marx, primitive
accumulation was an early, violent stage of dispossession that was
required in order to move into higher forms of human development. Marx
observed, "The discovery of gold and silver in the Americas, the
extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal
population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East
Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting
of blackskins, signalized the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
production." Not only are scholars challenging traditional ideas
regarding the relationship between racism and capitalism, but they are
also challenging when capitalism is thought to have begun. While Marx
himself saw primitive accumulation as distinct from capitalism, its
predecessor, if you will, this is being forcefully challenged by the
burgeoning literature on the history of capitalism. Is it accurate and
meaningful to segregate capitalism from the relations that gave rise to
it? Capitalism emerged, Marx continues, "dripping from head to foot,
from every pore, with blood and dirt." Severing such violence and racism
from capitalism is not only part of a larger ahistoricism, but it also
serves to validate capitalism, as it is seen as less violent than its
predecessor. However, primitive accumulation was essential to creating
the initial surplus that subsequently allowed for the development of
industrial capitalism. What is important for our purposes is that proto-
capitalists, colonists, and Christians all drew on white supremacy as
they went about the business of severing indigenous peoples from their
land and labor.

[It is [**important** to recall]{.mark} that [**racism** is not
**static**. Europeans began with]{.mark} a]{.underline} particular
[[conception of **white** supremacy]{.mark} but it [was
**elaborated**]{.mark} and **enhanced** [as]{.mark} they [went
about]{.mark}]{.underline} their business of
[[domination]{.underline}]{.mark} and exploitation. Though some dismiss
primitive accumulation as irrelevant and/or ancient history, it is
anything but. Decades ago Eric Williams documented how Caribbean slavery
helped finance England's early industrial and financial development.
Only now are greater numbers of scholars beginning to explore the
economic and political implications of primitive accumulation. For
example, Dunbar- Ortiz reminds us that in addition to the fact that the
United States was built on stolen territory, as it took native land, it
was placed in the public domain, sold, and generated funds to pay for an
expanding military. This, in turn, supported overseas expansion,
conquest, and empire. Recent books by Edward Baptist and Walter Johnson
have also demonstrated how the profits of slavery contributed to
contemporary US capitalism.

This is hardly the ancient past. These are the relations that birthed
the modern world and which continue to shape it. As Marita Sturken
reminds us, forgetting is a powerful form of memory. And we have put
enormous energy into forgetting this history. It is only by re- engaging
with it that we can appreciate the connection between the past and the
present. Jack Forbes clarifies this relationship, noting that living
persons are not responsible for what their ancestors did, but they are
responsible for the society they live in, which is a product of the
past.

While primitive accumulation helps explain the role of the past in
producing the racial map of the Anthropocene, it is relevant for another
reason. While many relegate primitive accumulation to the annals of
history, the truth is that it is back with a vengeance. While one could
argue that primitive accumulation never ended in the Global South, it
has reappeared in the Global North. David Harvey argues that primitive
accumulation has become a dominant form of accumulation in the
contemporary period because the rates of profit have fallen so markedly.
In response, capitalists have innovated and found new ways of producing
profits and power across the world. Primitive
[[accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, some argue, [can [be seen
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the massive [displacement from
**[gentrification]{.mark}**]{.underline} in many parts of the world,
[the [**2008** housing]{.mark} collapse, [and]{.mark} in]{.underline}
the poisoning of [[**Flint**, Michigan]{.mark}'s water]{.underline}.
These contemporary forms of accumulation are violent forms of taking, as
people lose their lands, lives, and livelihoods. Both old and new forms
of primitive accumulation require enabling ideologies. And though there
have been important changes, [[racism]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially
indifference, [[remains]{.mark} an **[important]{.mark}**
one]{.underline}. Allowing millions to die ensures the wealth,
prosperity, and convenience of rich countries, as well as powerful
industries and firms. [[**By not intervening** in]{.mark} the
**[processes]{.mark}** that will [produce]{.mark} massive
**[death]{.mark}**, they [avoid]{.mark} burdensome
**[regulations]{.mark}**; they [bypass]{.mark} a disruptive, [**rapid
shift** away from **fossil fuels**]{.mark}. Instead, they [**carry on**
as usual]{.mark}, working [to **maintain**]{.mark} their
**[profit]{.mark}** levels]{.underline} despite the fact that the
physical environment is shifting beneath their feet.

#### The complexities of the Anthropocene cannot be reduced to a root cause. Hierarchies and power dynamics are nor static across injustices.

The fact that the master/slave relation so precisely parallels the
human/ nonhuman natural relationship is hardly coincidental. As a wide
range of commentators have pointed out, almost all forms of systematic
dehu- manization involve comparing some group of humans to the nonhuman
world -- "they" are vermin, monkeys, insects, disease, sheep, dogs,
whatever -- and certainly American slavery's conceit of domesticated
animality was emblematic in this. Such comparisons are premised on an
abjected view of the nonhuman natural, in comparison with the
master/human who is the entity defined as that-which-can-do-whatever-
it-wants to the natural. This relationship makes racial and
environmental violence part of a larger internally reinforcing system,
one in which racism depends on a preexisting view of nonhuman nature as
subservient and degraded, a view of the natural that is in turn
reinforced by its association with racism.

[**I am not claiming that contemporary anxiety** about the Anthropocene
and its collapse of human and natural history **is "like" being an
enslaved person** in a way that "helps us understand what it was
like,]{.underline}" or that we're all becoming slaves too, or some
similarly crude formulation. [The [fact that there are]{.mark} some
[disturbing]{.mark} structural [parallels between slavery and]{.mark}
the [contemporary Anthropocene **does not make**]{.mark} **their
[traumas fungible]{.mark}**; **[position matters]{.mark}** radically,
always. [Nor]{.mark} am I saying [that slavery]{.mark} somehow [caused
the Anthropocene directly]{.mark}]{.underline} -- indeed in a cruel
irony, it is likely that a reliance on the labor of enslaved people
reduced the carbon footprint of the South by retarding the turn to the
carbon-intensive industrialization that the North made more quickly and
that likely gave the Union a decisive edge in the War. [I want to close
this chapter by moving away from a focus on individual experience, and
from the poles of, on the one hand, a former time when there seemed to
be (for some) a separation between human and natural
history]{.underline}, and when we hadn't yet come to see ourselves a
geologic force as a species, and on the other, an apocalyptic time to
come when human history will have been subsumed by natural history.
Instead, I want to end by asking what sort of power and violence comes
from straddling those two histories. [How do privilege and abjection
function as positions within the unstable and violent hybridity that
marks our Anthropocenic moment? [How might]{.mark} the history of
[slavery and white supremacy provide]{.mark} some vitally important
[contexts for]{.mark} how we think about our [modernity]{.mark}, about a
past that isn't past, no matter how urgently we use this crisis to
imagine that the past is irrelevant to the present?]{.underline}

These questions resonate powerfully with Latour's view of what he calls
the "modern constitution," a series of nature/culture hybrids whose
power comes in part from the contradictory insistence that, despite that
hybridity, modern state makes "Nature intervene at every point in the
fabrication of . . . societ\[y\]," while at the same time "attributing
to Nature its radical transcendence," a combination that allows the
"moderns" to "become the only actors in their own political destiny,
while they go right on making nature and culture are fundamentally
different things. For Latour, the modern state makes "Nature intervene
at every point in the fabrication of . . . societ\[y\]," while at the
same time "attributing to Nature its radical transcendence," a
combination that allows the "moderns" to "become the only actors in
their own political destiny, while they go right on making their society
hold together by mobilizing Nature." Latour's thesis not only reinforces
how profoundly unsettling the Anthropocene's collapse of nature and
culture is to the modern order, but implicitly suggests a deeper and
even more disturbing parallel between that order and the slave planta-
tion under white supremacy. The master-as-white-man was supposedly free,
agential, the "only actor in his political destiny," in
contradistinction to "his" slaves, a group of people whose forced
association with nature not only stripped them of agency, but were
precisely the labor that made the master's "society hold together." In
this context, the culture/nature distinction supposedly at the heart of
the time-before-the-Anthropocene in general was quite literally embodied
-- rooted -- in the plantation landscape 26 and the people who lived
there. To the extent Latour's influential thesis is correct, modernity
and the plantation are inextricable.

Perhaps more important, the breakdown of that distinction was one that
African Americans had been negotiating with, often as a matter of
physical and psychological survival, since the first enslaved people
arrived on this continent in 1619. [[If the collapse between human and
natur]{.mark}al history [is fundamental to]{.mark} the definition of the
[Anthropocene]{.mark}, [then]{.mark} the [millions]{.mark} of human
beings held [in chattel slavery experienced]{.mark} a\[n\]much [more
extreme version]{.mark} of the Anthropocene a [long]{.mark} time
[before]{.mark} Chakrabarty's "humanists" did]{.underline}, one that
imbricates the historical brutality of racism and the slow- motion
ecocide that is unfolding before us[. Looking to writers such as
Douglass to understand this profoundly fraught negotiation between
natural and human identity reminds us -- or should remind us -- of two
critically important contexts for our contemporary understanding of the
Anthropocene.]{.underline}

First, Douglass's exemplary anguish in being unable to either "become a
beast," or endure his all-too-human knowledge should make us consid-
erably less sanguine that a deeper identification between human and
natural will necessarily lead to salutary results for either group. Of
course such an identification in our current moment does and will unfold
differ- ently, but keeping the pernicious racist history of how a
human/natural collapse justified the exploitation of people and land by
making them coextensive could help us better think through the way
forward. It is all too easy for (white, especially) ecocritics and
environmentalists to assume, in an implicitly ahistorical way, that
humans "should" embrace the natural world, learn to live in "harmony"
with nature, celebrate "our" connection with nonhuman animals, reject
the anthropocentric assumptions at the heart of a rigid nature--culture
distinction. While doing so might avoid some of the horrors of the
master's position, and the racial and environ- mental violence it
instantiated, any rejection of anthropocentrism must first acknowledge
and then engage with the historical consequences of such a rejection for
powerless enslaved people such as Douglass and Jacobs. Viewed in that
context, the enslaved person's involuntary "closeness" to nature and the
degradation, humiliation, and subjection that connection occasioned,
should provide a powerful check on the too-easy assertions that greater
connections between human and nonhuman will automatic- ally be good for
both, and that anyone who finds that connection difficult, if not
traumatic, is, at best, unenlightened. Put another way, the partial
breakdown between human and natural history that the Anthropocene names
forecloses the possibility of a "right" or morally pure position outside
of it that we might occupy, and in doing so relieve ourselves from the
messy burden of living in a semi-broken world. [[Neither a separation
between human and natural, nor]{.mark} a [collapse]{.mark} of the two,
[nor]{.mark} an [uncertainty]{.mark} in their relation, [offer some
intrinsic way of being that frees us from taking ongoing responsibility
for our collective actions.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**There can all too
easily be a moral narcissism** in the search for **individual**
innocence **or guilt**, as if the "real" question is how to manage one's
own personal implication in the Anthropocene. If, instead, we start with
the inevitability of such an implication we might be better at focusing
on the historically saturated world we actually inhabit, rather than
trying to find a place outside of it where our individual guilt or
innocence is what matters.]{.underline}

#### The Anthropocene is [unprecedented]{.underline} and can't be explained by historical violence. [Historicizing]{.underline} it denies the [severity]{.underline} and the [necessity]{.underline} of action, which is [self-defeating]{.underline}. 

Zoltán Boldizsár **Simon 17**. Research Fellow at Bielefeld University,
assistant professor at Leiden University and Visiting Fellow at the Max
Planck Institute for the History of Science. "Why the Anthropocene Has
No History: Facing the Unprecedented." 2017. *The Anthropocene Review*
4.3, 239-245.

Oddly enough, the human component also constitutes the biggest obstacle
to the acknowledgment of the Anthropocene as an Anthro-pocene. [After
decades of postcolonial and gender criticism targeting the idea that
there could be a 'humanity' or 'human being' as the unitary subject of
an overall historical process]{.underline}, the [implicit universalism
of the Anthropocene often has a **repulsive effect**]{.underline}.
Dipesh Chakrabarty -- who had an eminent role in dismantling Western
universalism -- is acutely aware of the fact that the simultaneous
appeal to an inherently universal notion and to postcolonial criticism
results in a dilemma. When introducing the notion of the Anthropocene to
historical studies, Chakrabarty (2009: 219--220) captured it in the
following question: 'how do we relate to a universal history of life --
to universal thought, that is -- while retaining what is of obvious
value in our postcolonial suspicion of the universal?'.

Whereas Chakrabarty (2014) still struggles with trying to resolve the
dilemma, [much of humanities and social science research chooses either
the rejection or the approval of universalism]{.underline}. Both choices
are apparent in the tendency to propose alternative names for the
Anthropocene. [According to already influential arguments, the notion in
its current form enshrouds social, cultural, and political inequalities
effective in bringing about the broader condition otherwise associated
with the Anthropocene. Hence it would be more accurate to talk about the
**Technocene**]{.underline} (Hornborg, 2015) or the
**[Capitalocene]{.underline}** (Moore, 2017). By invoking technology and
capitalism as notions more sensitive to inequalities, these alternatives
offer powerful corrections to the universalism of the Anthropocene. At
the same time and on the other edge of the spectrum, the idea of a
**[Cosmopolocene]{.underline}** (Delanty and Mota, 2017) affirms
universalism by assuming that the Anthropocene provides the condition of
possibility for the establishment of a global and truly cosmopolitan
politics. Contrary to appearance, the Cosmopolocene is very far from
being the complete opposite of the Technocene and the Capitalocene. It
is rather their supplement that attributes a desired future direction to
the same socio-political development whose past is outlined by the
Capitalocene and the Technocene. Whereas the latter notions point to the
origins of a present condition in terms of inequality, the Cosmopolocene
entails a normative take on how the very same inequality may be overcome
in future.

It can easily be seen how these alternative names intend to add new
dimensions to our understanding of what natural sciences came to call
the Anthropocene. Regardless of whether one agrees or not with the
particular ethical and political take of any of the individual
alternatives, their work is indispensable in thematizing the
relationship between the social world and nature from the viewpoint of
the former. But [is the case the same as seen from the natural sciences?
**[Does geology know inequality]{.mark}** among humans? Is a geological
or an ecological perspective capable of distinguishing which humans
under what socio-political conditions brought about the Anthropocene in
the first place? Should it be capable?]{.underline} Or, at the most
general, [[does it matter to]{.mark} [nature]{.mark}]{.underline} (as we
conceive of nature) [that along certain human conceptualizations of
social divisions [certain humans are]{.mark} **greatly
[responsible]{.mark} for launching the Anthropocene**[, **while others
are not?**]{.mark}]{.underline} And even if it did, would it be the
reigning natural scientific understanding of the Anthropocene (which
criticism in the humanities would identify again as specifically
Western) to which all the alternative names add new dimensions? Or would
it be rather a parallel discourse?

[These are]{.underline}, I believe, **[[deeply troubling
questions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet it seems to me that [[talking
about the]{.mark} Technocene, the [Capitalocene]{.mark} or the
Cosmpolocene **[amounts to]{.mark}**, simply and plainly, **[talking
about something other than the Anthropocene]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[They are]{.mark} not alternative names for the same thing, but names
for **[entirely different]{.mark}** and yet heavily interconnected
things and phenomena.]{.underline} Even when the name is retained, [the
humanities and the social sciences **debate things that are different in
kind** while they both **appear to debate the
Anthropocene**]{.underline}. Despite the fact that in the larger debate
both natural and human sciences appeal to the satisfaction of wider
societal concerns, [their respective concerns conflict and thus **seem
[incompatible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

To unpack the situation, the conflict boils down to contradictory sets
of societal demands. On the one hand, [the necessity to recognize the
[Anthropocene]{.mark} as an epochal transformation in nature (and the
way in which nature changes) is based on a future prospect]{.underline}.
In this prospect, human activity transforms the environmental conditions
to the extent that the planet becomes either hardly habitable or wholly
inhabitable by humans. An indicative example of a future scenario of
partial human extinction is outlined by Oreskes and Conway (2014),
demanding action by sketching a history written from the viewpoint of a
fictitious catastrophic future in which the human population of
Australia and Africa go extinct. [The worst case scenario [is]{.mark},
however, the [prospect of a **wholesale human
extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is precisely what motivated
Chakrabarty (2009: 197--198) to engage with human-induced climate change
in the first place. [Either way, this future prospect creates a **demand
for preventive action**, accompanied by a **strong sense of
urgency**]{.underline}. Furthermore, all this qualifies as an
'anthropogenic existential risk', a term borrowed from Nick Bostrom
(2013: 16). Although Bostrom reserves the most threatening prospect of
extinction that arises out of human activity for potential technological
innovations, it stands to reason that the future entailed by the
Anthropocene is just as much an existential risk as the future entailed
by artificial intelligence research.

Contrary to this, [[debates]{.mark} about the Technocene, the
Capitalocene, and even discussions under the retained name of the
Anthropocene in the humanities and social sciences, are [based
on]{.mark} the [primacy of a **retrospective
stance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such a stance looks backward in time in
order to explain how the current state of affairs has developed out of
past conditions]{.underline}. The Cosmopolocene adds to this operation a
maintained utopian imperative in the shape of a desirable future
cosmopolitanism. [On the one hand, it **[counters]{.mark} the natural
[scientific future prospect]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[Anthropocene as
catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline}; on the other, just as the
Technocene and the Capitalocene, [it **[reserves]{.mark} the
[catastrophic take for the past]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For it is only
with comparison to the past that the future may look better, which
clearly points to the imperative implied by these alternative names: the
demand for social justice]{.underline}. Whereas the Technocene and the
Capitalocene point to the roots of social injustice, the Cosmopolocene
also imagines a future condition in which social justice may be reached.
The normative condition of social justice may be different for
practically any individual conceptualization. What binds all of them
together is not their particular stance on what constitutes social
justice, but the sheer fact that they either tacitly or deliberately
demand such justice in one form or another.

However, the difference between the diverging imperatives of the ways in
which the humanities and the natural sciences conceptualize
human-induced climate change is most apparent in their views on the
character of required agency. [The demand for social justice relies on a
mode of action completely different than what the demand for preventive
action calls for.]{.underline} [Whereas the former urges action in order
to realize a desired outcome]{.underline}, [the latter calls for action
as a response to a threat posed by an undesired future]{.underline}. In
other words, whereas the demand for social justice constitutes a
proactive mode of action, the demand for preventive action is -- by
definition -- a reactive one. Both demands and modes of action are
legitimate and important, but [they seem utterly
incompatible.]{.underline}

Now, in what sense exactly are these demands incompatible? It must be
clear that [the incompatibility does not mean that the concerns of the
demands **do not meet in any sense whatsoever**]{.underline}. First of
all, [both ground their respective calls for societal engagement in the
present impact of human activity on natural activity]{.underline}. What
is more, despite their respective focus in the past and in the future,
**[both demands invoke both the past and the future to a certain
extent]{.underline}**. As mentioned earlier, [a [retrospective
stance]{.mark} seeking for social justice [**implies a future** in which
such justice can be reached]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [a
prospective stance urging preventive action implies a past state of
affairs compared with which the future appears as radically
other]{.underline}. Hence the diverging demands are deeply connected in
that they both invoke a conception of change over time that encompasses
past, present, and future state of affairs. However, what seems to bind
them together is precisely what ultimately sets them apart. For, on a
more primordial level, the diverging demands and modes of action rely on
two different temporalities and thereby two different conceptions of
change over time. Whereas the demand for immediate action revolves
around a temporality of what I have conceptualized elsewhere as
unprecedented change (Simon, 2015), [the demand for social justice is
grounded in the processual change of modern]{.underline} (Western)
[historical sensibility]{.underline}.

To begin with the latter, critics of the notion of the Anthropocene are
well aware of the fact that what they recourse to is historical
thinking. Malm and Hornborg (2014: 63) are explicit in that it is 'the
historical origins of anthropogenic climate change' that 'were
predicated on highly inequitable global processes from the start'.
Similarly, Moore (2017: 594) already makes it clear in the abstract that
arguing for the Capitalocene means nothing other than arguing 'for the
centrality of historical thinking in coming to grips with capitalism's
planetary crises of the twenty-first century'. Finally, in a
complementary manner, when advocating the universalist idea of the
Cosmopolocene, Delanty and Mota (2017: 11) state that it is insofar as
'consciousness of the new human condition enters into historical
self-understanding' that the Anthropocene 'can be seen as a new cultural
model that is constitutive of a new object of knowledge and an order of
governance'.

[Invoking the modern concept of history and historical thinking in
trying to make sense of the Anthropocene amounts to the creation of a
historical trajectory into which the Anthropocene]{.underline}
(Capitalocene, Technocene, Cosmopolocene) [can be
accommodated]{.underline} as a new stage of a long-term development. [It
amounts to the [creation of a deep **temporal continuity**]{.mark} by
[assuming]{.mark} that a particular event or [phenomena]{.mark}
perceived as something new **[makes sense only as seen within]{.mark} a
[larger]{.mark} [historical process]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to
the philosophical investigations of Hannah Arendt into the modern
concept of history, conceiving of change as processual both in nature
and in the domain of human affairs is what 'separated the modern age
from the past more profoundly than any other single idea' (Arendt, 1961:
63). This processual temporality underlying the modern Western concept
of history, rather obviously, also informs the discipline of history as
a study of human beings. For Chakrabarty (2009: 197), it means that 'the
discipline of history exists on the assumption that our past, present,
and future are connected by a certain continuity of human experience'.
And [the challenge of the [Anthropocene]{.mark} is precisely that 'the
current crisis can precipitate a sense of the present that disconnects
the future from the past by putting such a future beyond the grasp of
historical sensibility']{.underline} (Chakrabarty, 2009: 197).

What this means is that the challenge of the Anthropocene's future
prospect is a challenge to nothing other than modern historical thinking
itself. In such a prospect, the Anthropocene appears as rupture as
Hamilton (2016) argues, although for Hamilton it is not the vision of
the future that introduces the rupture. Nevertheless, [what the rupture
entails is the same: the sudden occurrence of a novelty that [is **not
the result of**]{.mark} **a [continuous long-term development]{.mark}**
that originates in the deep past.]{.underline} [This is what I call the
prospect of **unprecedented change**]{.underline}, [the prospect of a
singular event expected to defy all previous human
experience.]{.underline} It appears as the ultimate threat insofar as
**[[the future becomes incomprehensible]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to human
cognition, [due to]{.mark} the [possibility of **losing control** over
what originally was a human-induced]{.mark} [change]{.mark}. The
possibility of reaching a [point **when nature takes over**]{.mark}
anthropogenic climate change is the singular event whose **[consequences
are inaccessible]{.mark}** not only to human cognition, but inasmuch as
all previous human experience is defied, even to human
imagination.]{.underline}

By unprecedented change, however, I do not mean merely a synonym for the
future prospect of the Anthropocene. The concept is intended to
encompass perceptions of change over time not only in the geological and
ecological domains but also in the realm of technology (Simon, 2018).
For it must be clear that 'the age of the Anthropocene' is not the only
'age' that appears as unprecedented today. The 'information age'
following the 'digital revolution' or the 'atomic age' may be the most
obvious instances of a postwar tendency to perceive of the future as
promising to bring about something unprecedented. Like the Anthropocene,
these [prospects also entail the eradication of human life at worst or
the sudden alteration of it beyond recognition at best]{.underline}. The
prospect of global nuclear warfare appears just as much unprecedented as
the prospect of human extinction entailed by the Anthropocene. But the
most illustrative example is the creation of a non-human but
greater-than-human superintelligence, which is conceptualized by Vernor
Vinge (1993) as 'technological singularity'. It is likely followed by an
'intelligence explosion' of greater-than-human intelligence creating
even greater non-human intelligence with unimaginable speed. As a sudden
singular event, it also entails the prospect of losing control of an
originally human-induced activity, with possible consequences
impenetrable to the human mind.

Although for the time being technological singularity belongs to the
realm of mere speculation, [the effects of anthropogenic climate change
are already felt]{.underline}. Hence the vision of the future entailed
by the notion of the Anthropocene is far more tangible than other
prospects of unprecedented change. [When the humanities and social
sciences **invoke modern [historical thinking]{.mark}** in **trying to
make sense of it**, they [**do more damage than good** to]{.mark} its
[recognition]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By creating deep continuities of
historical trajectories, [they **incapacitate**]{.mark} **the [demand
for immediate and preventive action]{.mark}** [that **derives
from**]{.mark} **the prospect of [the
unprecedented]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some historians are very well
aware of such perils within their craft. As Libby Robin (2013: 336)
warns, [historians 'can "discount the present" by providing a deep
past']{.underline}. In the case of the Anthropocene [it is nevertheless
the future and its perceived threat that can be **discounted by modern
historical thinking**]{.underline}. What this means is that [[the
deeper]{.mark} and longer-term [history of the]{.mark}
[Anthropocene]{.mark} one tries to write, **[the deeper and longer
continuity one implies]{.mark}** and **[the farther away one moves
from]{.mark} a sense of [urgency for action]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The
less one thinks that what one faces is the unprecedented, **[the more
one thinks]{.mark} that all [this is business as
usual]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The deeper one looks into the past to find
the origin out of which the Anthropocene develops, [the more one thinks
that **this is how things have always been**.]{.underline}

In the final analysis, [modern historical thinking]{.underline} -- once
a vehicle of social change and social action -- [appears today as an
**obstacle to the recognition** of **newly emerging concerns** which
revolve around a completely different conception of change and mode of
action]{.underline}. However, this is not to say that modern historical
thinking is an obstacle to every change; it is still the condition of
possibility of social emancipation. Nor is this to say that anything
that qualifies as history and historical thinking is an obstacle. [This
is only to say that the modern (Western) conception of history which
ideas such as the Technocene, the Capitalocene or the Cosmopolocene rely
on is an **obstacle to the recognition of the Anthropocene as
unprecedented**]{.underline}.

Yet, in principle, nothing excludes the possibility to conceptualize
another notion of history capable of recognizing the unprecedented.
After all, it is still about change over time in human affairs. In fact,
historians and philosophers of history are already engaged in the task
of conceptualizing a historical sensibility other than processual
(Kleinberg, 2017; Lorenz and Bevernage, 2013; Runia, 2006; Simon, 2016).
Accordingly, the claim I wish to make is restricted to the
still-dominant mode of historical thinking and it goes as follows:
[[attempting to write the history of the Anthropocene]{.mark} by
invoking modern processual historical thinking [is]{.mark} an
**[untenable]{.mark}**, **[self-contradictory]{.mark}**, and
**[self-defeating enterprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For inasmuch as
the Anthropocene appears as unprecedented, **it does not have a
processual history**]{.underline}; and inasmuch as it has a processual
history, it is not the Anthropocene (but the Capitalocene, the
Technocene or the Cosmopolocene).

[From **Alaska to Florida**, [Native Americans are facing
**severe**]{.mark} **[climate challenges]{.mark}**, the newest threat in
a history marked by centuries of distress and dislocation. While other
communities struggle on a warming planet, Native tribes are
[experiencing]{.mark} an [environmental **peril** exacerbated by
policies]{.mark} --- [first imposed by **white settlers**]{.mark} and
later the **United States government** --- [that forced them onto the
country's **least desirable lands**]{.mark}. And [now, climate change
is]{.mark} quickly [making that marginal land
**uninhabitable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The first Americans face the
loss of home once again. [In the Pacific Northwest, **[coastal
erosion]{.mark}** and storms are eating away at tribal land, [forcing
native communities to]{.mark} try to [**move** inland]{.mark}. In the
Southwest, severe drought means the Navajo Nation is [**running out** of
**drinking water**]{.mark}. At the edge of the Ozarks, [heirloom
**crops** are becoming harder to **grow**, threatening]{.mark} to
**[disconnect]{.mark}** the Cherokee [from]{.mark} their
**[heritage]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Compounding the damage from its past
decisions, the federal government has continued to neglect Native
American communities, where substandard housing and infrastructure make
it harder to cope with climate shocks. The federal government is also
less likely to help Native communities recover from extreme weather or
help protect them against future calamities, a New York Times review of
government data shows. Interviews with officials, members and advisers
at 15 federally recognized tribes portray a gathering climate crisis and
a test of the country's renewed focus on racial equity and environmental
justice. [[Many tribes have been working to meet the challenges]{.mark}
posed by the changing climate. [And]{.mark} they [have expressed hope
that their concerns would be **addressed**]{.mark} by President
Biden]{.underline}, who has committed to repairing the relationship with
tribal nations and appointed Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous cabinet
secretary, to run the Interior Department. But Mr. Biden has announced
few specific policies or actions to directly reduce the climate risk
already facing Native communities, and Ms. Haaland's office declined
repeated requests for an interview. "The stakes are very, very high,"
said Fawn Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians.
"We're running out of time."

Forced Off Their Land, Again

The Quileute Nation is a collection of about 135 homes on a narrow slice
of land at the edge of the Olympic Peninsula that juts into the Pacific,
about 100 miles west of Seattle. As temperatures rise, the atmosphere
holds more water, producing more frequent and intense storms. High winds
now regularly knock out the electricity, while homes along the main
street are vulnerable to flooding. The single road that connects the
community to the outside world is often rendered impassable by water.
"The village is 10 to 15 feet above sea level," said Susan Devine, a
project manager who is working with the Quileute. During major storms
"those waves are bigger than you," she said. Hundreds of years ago, the
reservation was a fishing village, among many locations used by the
Quileute as they moved according to the demands of the weather. That
changed in 1855 when a treaty stripped the tribe of most of its land;
President Grover Cleveland later issued an executive order confining the
Quileute to a single square mile --- all of it exposed to flooding. "No
one chose to be in a seasonal fishing area year-round," Ms. Devine said.
[The resulting vulnerability has pushed the tribe to pursue a solution
that few non-Native towns in the United States have seriously
considered: **Retreating** to higher ground. "[Climate change has
**forced** us to make the heart-wrenching decision to **leave the
village**]{.mark}," Doug Woodruff, chairman of the Quileute Tribal
Council, said in a December statement. "[Without a **cohesive
national**]{.mark} and international **[strategy]{.mark}** to
**address** climate change, [there is **little** we can do to **combat**
these **impacts**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Why is finding climate solutions a political problem? Most of the
solutions to the climate challenge have been right under our noses for a
while. [It's not a mystery that burning fossil fuels emits
planet-warming greenhouse gases.]{.underline} It's crystal clear that
clean, renewable energy sources, combined with efficient transmission
and storage, are a better solution. The question is why we've been so
slow as a society to make this transition. And that's a pretty
straightforward story about [the disinformation campaigns and enormous
political power of the lucrative legacy energy industry]{.underline}.
We're in deep at this point, and **[[we won't come close to
meeting]{.mark} our emissions [targets unless we pull the biggest lever
available: policy change.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Maddeningly, progress
has been stymied by insufficient political will. That's why half a
trillion dollars in climate provisions passed by the US House of
Representatives have been stalled in the Senate. And it's why we're
still developing new oil and gas fields and subsidizing fossil fuels
when the International Energy Agency has stated that the only viable
path to curbing global temperatures involves no new investments in oil,
gas, or coal. This cognitive dissonance underscores the misaligned
incentives at play when policymakers are beholden to special interests.
**[Finding climate solutions isn't a political problem. But [to
accelerate the deployment]{.mark} of these solutions [at scale, policies
need to change ]{.mark}]{.underline}**at every level of government; the
inertia is squarely a political problem. What is missing from the
current climate activist narrative? [The current climate [activist
narrative is multifaceted]{.mark}, with lots of distinct and
interweaving threads.]{.underline} I'm grateful for all the courageous
voices lifting up different angles and frames, from the environmental
injustices and public health implications to the faith and
stewardship-based appeals, to the business case for ambitious climate
solutions. I'll share some thoughts about [elements of the
[discourse]{.mark} that [could use more daylight to foster more civic
action]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, there is a problematic paradigm that
requires a bit of nuance: the notion that it's either "too late" or that
"we still have time---as though it's a binary proposition. This framing
leads people to decide that they can focus on other priorities since "we
have time," or worse, it leads to resignation: "It's too late, so why
bother?" In reality, every fraction of a degree of precluded warming is
a win, and "doomism" fuels individual and collective despair that
hinders engagement. [[If we]{.mark} could better [convey]{.mark} that
[there is a spectrum of]{.mark} climate [impacts and]{.mark} that [we
can avoid the worst outcomes]{.mark}, more [people]{.mark} would
[recognize their]{.mark} own [agency]{.mark}.]{.underline} Another
deeply-rooted challenge is the widespread dependence on partisan
rhetoric. We're facing a climate emergency. Preserving the
livability---the survivability---of the planet we call home should not
break along party lines. In the US, climate is among the most
politicized issues because it was intentionally weaponized for political
division by bad actors. These bad actors relish a piecemeal, sluggish,
and disorganized clean energy transition because they benefit from
stringing out the fossil fuel-dependent economy as long as possible. The
more we perpetuate the use of a partisan framework for describing
climate action, the more we play into their hands. The climate crisis is
a political problem, so we need to get political---but many people are
turned off by inflammatory partisan politics. [Climate activism and
advocacy are still fringe---another symptom of the success of fossil
fuel propaganda. These dynamics dampen civic action, and insufficient
civic engagement is arguably among our biggest impediments to
progress.]{.underline} The need to increase civic engagement is not
missing from the climate activist narrative---it's often in the
foreground---but it's still too muted. Climate activism and advocacy are
still weirdly fringe, which is another symptom of the success of fossil
fuel propaganda. Recently, **[[scientists]{.mark} around the world [have
been engaging in civil disobedience]{.mark}, and those protests have
hardly even been picked up by the media.]{.underline}** The IPCC reports
make headlines for a day, and then Will Smith gets heated at the Oscars
and our heated planet takes a back seat. **[The climate
[activist]{.mark} narrative [would benefit from an even greater emphasis
on]{.mark} cultivating more "askers," [people willing to galvanize more
participation]{.mark}]{.underline}** by asking their friends, family,
colleagues, and neighbors to step up. It's important to lead by example,
but that's not enough. [Those of us steeped in the climate movement have
a responsibility to make climate action relevant to more people and keep
it top of mind.]{.underline} We have the opportunity to scale our impact
by two, 10, or even 100 times by inviting more doomscrollers to become
changemakers. How is Climate Changemakers helping to connect the dots
between political action and climate progress? Climate Changemakers is a
nonpartisan climate advocacy organization. We don't use "nonpartisan" as
code for "centrist" or "bipartisan"; rather, it [references a commitment
to omit partisan rhetoric altogether and take political action using a
climate lens.]{.underline} We're not trying to change minds---we're
built to serve the almost one-third of Americans who are already willing
to take political action on climate but are not yet engaged. In many
ways, these [people have already connected the dots between political
action and climate progress. But there is still a lot of dot-connecting
to be done since this segment of the population hasn't yet been asked to
take action]{.underline} by someone they like and respect. So we're
asking. And then we're helping our volunteer changemakers turn around
and start doing the asking. People need a place to plug in, so we're
providing a place. Our weekly drop-in Hours of Action function like a
virtual, facilitated climate action cafe. **[[Changemakers need
guidance]{.mark} with respect to high-leverage electoral [and policy
priorities]{.mark}, and they need tips on how [to be effective,
strategic advocates.]{.mark} We help by [curating productive ways to
engage policymakers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We identify what we call "no
brainer" candidates and **[policies and]{.underline}** pair them with
**[playbooks]{.underline}** that make it simple and accessible **[[to
take powerful actions.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There are still more dots
to connect. We help people understand "why bother?" by packaging our
actions with information to convey that [it's worthwhile to advocate
with your elected officials no matter what. Whether they are already
climate champions or obstructionists that seemingly can't be moved,
every single policymaker can and must do more, just like every one of us
can and must do more.]{.underline} That's the basis of our ethos: we're
asking everyone to rise to the occasion and become a climate
changemaker. What can Americans do to become climate advocates at both
the grassroots and top levels? **[[People need help]{.mark} both
[becoming effective advocates and staying engaged]{.mark}, and that's
where groups and communities come in.]{.underline}** My first tip is to
find a group. There are a lot of great climate groups out there. Some
are geared more towards young people; others are geared towards older
demographics. Some are faith-based. Some are more or less disruptive.
Some focus narrowly on a singular priority, while others advocate for a
range of priorities. There are groups advocating through a lens of
partisan identity from different points along the ideological spectrum.
Climate Changemakers is a great place to plug in if our nonpartisan
ethos resonates. We strive to cultivate a broad, inclusive community,
and work closely with a range of partners to leverage our unique spheres
of influence and the power of collective action. My second tip is to
carve out the time because effective advocacy takes longer than a few
clicks. At Climate Changemakers, meaningful and productive volunteer
advocacy is central to our approach. We acknowledge that this isn't easy
work, but we make it simple and accessible with action playbooks that
we've developed using evidence-based research on best practices in
effective advocacy. My third tip is to make it a habit as sustained
engagement is critical. [The scope of the political work is two-fold:
increasing political will can be accomplished through electoral work
(changing the constellation of decision-makers) and through direct
policy advocacy (influencing their behavior). Voting is
essential]{.underline}**,** but it's not enough. It's important to
proactively advocate for climate candidates at all levels of government
by helping to amplify their campaigns, boost voter turnout, and raise
the resources they need to be successful. Policy advocacy can seem
intimidating, so our resources are designed to remove that friction. To
determine how to **[[maximize your impact as an effective policy
advocate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we have developed a decision-tree-based
tool. That brings me to my fourth tip: be bold and ready to level up
quickly. Phone calls to policymakers are a great starting point; even
better, write a letter to the editor, an op-ed, or schedule a
constituent meeting. Constituent meetings are the gold standard with
respect to influencing policymakers' opinions. Their willingness and
determination to prioritize evidence-based climate legislation are
fluid, and relationship-building through common ground and authentic,
personalized messaging is the secret sauce. The vast majority of
constituents don't realize that they can request meetings with
congressional staff. It's not rocket science, it's a wildly
under-utilized strategy. At Climate Changemakers, we have a series of
playbooks to help changemakers schedule, prepare for, and conduct
effective constituent meetings. Finally, my fifth tip is to make sure
your climate advocacy casts a long shadow. Punch above your own weight
by setting a visible example, inspiring others around you to do the
same, and proactively asking them to join your efforts.

**[Global [climate change is a "massive collective action
problem."]{.mark} While changes in individual behavior]{.underline}**
(for example, energy conservation) **[can help reduce emissions,
[system-level changes]{.mark} to the way human societies use energy and
natural resources [are necessary]{.mark} to limit global warming to
"safe" levels.]{.underline}** [[Government policy is one important
means]{.mark} of system change --- [including laws, rules, regulations,
standards, and incentives]{.mark}.]{.underline} But many climate change
policies, from the local level to the global level, founder on the lack
of "political will" --- the unwillingness or inability of government
officials to enact policies that will reduce carbon pollution at the
scale and speed required. [Public will, especially as expressed through
[citizen activism]{.mark}, [is an important influence on the policymaker
process.]{.mark} Strong public demand increases the likelihood that
governments will prioritize climate change action.]{.underline} Public
will refers to a "social system's shared recognition of a particular
problem and resolve to address the situation in a particular way through
sustained collective action." Indicators of public will can include
public support for mitigation policies, contacting government officials,
and pro-climate consumer behavior. Importantly, however, there is no
single, homogenous "public" --- there are many diverse "publics" within
any society. Strong public demand increases the likelihood that
governments will prioritize climate change action. One key set of
citizens is an issue public --- a relatively small proportion of a
population that is passionate about a specific issue. Issue publics are
highly attentive to and seek out information about their issue, have
relatively high levels of knowledge, have developed strong and stable
attitudes, and are more likely than other citizens to take action on the
issue. Some issue publics are diffuse, with few and weak connective ties
between individual members. Others are highly organized through social,
institutional, or advocacy groups and networks, which can make them
powerful political actors. One example of the latter is the National
Rifle Association --- an organized issue public of approximately four to
five million members (in a country of more than 250 million adults) who
wield political clout far beyond their numbers on the issues they care
about. Public will can thus include at least three levels of citizen
engagement: (1) general public support for an issue or policy, (2) an
issue public focused on that issue or policy, and (3) an organized issue
public mobilized to exert influence on policymakers. In turn, [[a
mobilized]{.mark} issue [public can include diverse groups]{.mark},
organized into a coordinated "advocacy coalition" of partners working
together to achieve a common goal. Separately, there is always "limited
space available on the political or decision-making agenda, that is the
continually evolving, brief list of issues that command policy makers'
attention at a given time." ["**Windows of Opportunity"**]{.mark}
**theory says an issue is "[most likely]{.mark} to reach the political
agenda [when]{.mark} three things occur at the same time: [a problem is
perceived as]{.mark} important and [urgent]{.mark} by the public and

change, but even then, change is not inevitable. **[[Advocates have to

opens. [After it closes, only incremental progress is likely]{.mark}

### AT: Critical Geographies

#### Critical geographic work remains [trapped in the academy]{.underline}.

As [**[critical geographers]{.mark}**, among other Left
**academics**]{.underline}, pursue more relevant and meaningful work,
and advocate its worth, they often neglect an important issue. This
statement by Castree is typical, though by no means unique (see also,
among many others, Blomley 1994; Castree 2002a, 2002b; Massey 2000,
2001; Peck 1999; Pollard et al 2000; Staeheli and Mitchell 2005):

Critical geographers, less inclined than their liberal or conservative
colleagues to accept the world as it is, are saying meaningful things
about the "big issues." Neither trite nor ludicrous (or at least not
always), they are anatomizing (sic) resource exhaustion, hazard
creation, and environmental degradation; they [are
illuminating]{.underline} the role of spatiality in [relations of
**exploitation**, **sexism**, **racism**, ethnic chauvinism,
**neocolonialism**, and **homophobia**; they are not afraid to [pass
judgment on]{.mark} everything from]{.underline} the
**[practices]{.underline}** of the WTO [through]{.underline} the
**[science]{.underline}** of the IPCC [to]{.underline} the **[[policy
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** of "workfare;" [and they are prepared to
**[imagine a world where capitalism, patriarchy]{.mark}, and [all the
rest do not exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**But who is listening**
to]{.mark} this chorus of **[Left geographical
voices?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [The question is an important
one]{.underline} \... we should be proud of the collective efforts of
Left geographers these last three decades: for today we have a range of
critical voices saying deep and profound things about the myriad horrors
and injustices which surround us. [The problem]{.underline}, though, [is
that very few people outside]{.underline} geography [seem aware of this
fact]{.underline} \...[But **[is it enough]{.mark}** that **Left
geographers speak to themselves** (in journals and **at conferences**)
and to a **few interested others**]{.underline} in cognate disciplines?
[The answer, **[clearly]{.mark}**, is **[no]{.mark}**. **[If
"real]{.mark} world" [events]{.mark}**---be they [**quotidian social
struggles** or]{.mark} the [**grand strategies of states and
corporations**---become **no more than grist** for **critical
geographers**']{.mark} next]{.underline} peer-refereed journal [paper
or]{.underline} next annual conference [presentation [then the **whole
enterprise is**]{.mark} **clearly [bankrupt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So
who should Left geographers be talking to? And what makes critical
geography "critical?" (2000:2091--2092).

[[Integrating Black Geographies]{.mark} and Critical Physical
Geography]{.underline}

[Attending to the biophysical afterlife of slavery [requires an
**interdisciplinary approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
**[McKittrick]{.underline}** and Woods (Citation2007)
[posit]{.underline} that [Black geographies "demand]{.underline} an
[**interdisciplinary understanding** of space and place-making [that
**enmeshes, rather than separates**]{.mark}, different [theoretical
trajectories and spatial concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}" (7). [Black
geographies]{.underline}, as an integration of Black studies and
geography, **[epitomizes this interdisciplinarity]{.underline}** as
[[scholars **draw from**]{.mark} archival, [**policy**,
**ethnographic**, **artistic**]{.mark}, poetry, novels, [and
**traditional social science**]{.mark} **sources** to [**make powerful
insights** into Black geographic]{.mark} and ecological
[life]{.mark}]{.underline} (see also Bledsoe Citation2021).
Environmental science methods largely have yet to be incorporated into
Black geographies scholarship, however.

CPG, on the other hand, foregrounds environmental science, particularly
physical geography, and advocates for critical attention to the social
and historical factors that shape biophysical landscapes. Critical
physical geographers stress that "socio-biophysical landscapes are as
much the product of unequal power relations, histories of colonialism,
and racial and gender disparities as they are of hydrology, ecology, and
climate change" (Lave et al. Citation2014, 2). The goal of
interdisciplinarity in CPG is threefold. First, CPG scholars want to
stress the social and biophysical coproduction of landscapes (Lave et
al. Citation2014; Holifield and Day Citation2017; Lave, Biermann, and
Lane Citation2018). This is particularly an important conviction for
those analyzing the Anthropocene and its inherent eco-social nature
(Biermann, Lane, and Lave Citation2018; Urban Citation2018; Biermann,
Kelley, and Lave Citation2021). Second, they aim to foster critical
questioning of traditional scientific practices within the natural
sciences (Lave Citation2015; Tadaki et al. Citation2015; Lane
Citation2017; Lave, Biermann, and Lane Citation2018). Finally, this
scholarship sets out to highlight the socioecological impacts of
research and knowledge production (Lave, Biermann, and Lane
Citation2018).

CPG scholars have articulated, since its inception, that questions of
power and justice are central to the subfield's agenda (Lave et al.
Citation2014; Lave, Biermann, and Lane Citation2018). Scholars have
employed a CPG approach to expose inherent coloniality, oppression, and
violence in hegemonic environmental science and environmental management
practices (Barron et al. Citation2015; Duvall, Butt, and Neely
Citation2018; Colucci et al. Citation2021; Correia Citation2022).
Moreover, in its aim to produce more reflexive science, [CPG has
provided [studies **emphasizing**]{.mark} the [importance of community
voice]{.mark} in shaping research agendas and questions]{.underline}
(Biehler et al. Citation2018). **[Furthermore]{.underline}**, [CPG
scholarship has [argued for **approaches**]{.mark} **that
[increase]{.mark} the [policy impact]{.mark}** [of **political
ecological research**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lave Citation2014). Although
CPG scholars have applied this approach to identify racial disparities
in environmental experiences and protections (Biehler et al.
Citation2018; Spears Citation2021), [there has been little work that
integrates critical approaches to geographies of race or nondominant
epistemologies]{.underline} (see McClintock Citation2015; Correia
Citation2022 for exception).

**[McKittrick]{.underline}** teaches us that [[naming violence
**without** highlighting]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[systematic
underpinnings and subaltern modes of struggle]{.mark} and living
[against]{.mark} this [violent system **leaves us in the same
place**]{.mark}]{.underline} (McKittrick Citation2011, Citation2016;
Hudson and McKittrick Citation2014). "No one moves" (McKittrick,
Citation2016, 16). [**Therefore[, naming racial disparities and making
policy interventions are important]{.mark}**[, but we must
understand]{.mark}]{.underline} that [such [policy will be]{.mark} but
one [thread within]{.mark} a [political economic system bound together
by plantation]{.mark} and colonial [logics]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, how can we do environmental science research and outcomes in
and with racialized communities in ways that honor subaltern ways of
knowing space and place and modes of struggle for decolonization and
abolition? How can we truly hope to abolish the biophysical afterlife of
slavery without it?

[Understanding, analyzing, and **[working to
abolish]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[**biophysical afterlife of
slavery** entails]{.mark} a deep **[understanding]{.mark}** of the
**[sociopolitical]{.mark}** and ideological [processes that
**hold**]{.mark} **the [afterlife of slavery in
place]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well as intricate understandings of
biophysical function. An integration of the strengths of Black
geographies and CPG shapes one appropriate theoretical and
methodological framework for this task. This drawing together of Black
geographies frameworks and variations of environmental science has
largely not been practiced, with a few notable exceptions in geology,
archeology, and ecology. Yusoff (Citation2018) draws on extensive
research on geology's rise a as discipline and arbiter of geologic eras.
The author highlighted the ways scientific racism and notions of the
human have coursed through the field and its process to differentiate
scientific time periods. Yusoff (Citation2018) and J. Davis et al.
(Citation2019) stress that discourse on the Anthropocene, and even those
aiming to nuance this literature by emphasizing the importance of
capitalism and the rupture between human and nonhuman life, have largely
neglected the role of race and the contributions of Black geographies
epistemologies on Black ecological life and repair.

Several archeologists and community scientists of the organization
Divers with a Purpose have integrated the science of archeology and
ocean conservation principles and practices with work to honor enslaved
African ancestors lost in slave trade shipwrecks found in the depths of
the ocean (Divers with a Purpose Citation2021). This work has led not
only to the discovery and honoring of ancestors at various slave trade
shipwreck sites across the Atlantic, but also novel approaches to
oceanic mapping and understandings of maroon geographies (Dunnavant
Citation2021).

Soils and land have long been central to the description of Black people
as enslaved labor, working soils for white capitalist accumulation.
Recently, however, various scholars have urged us to move beyond this
connection to land that is essentialized to labor (King Citation2019;
Moulton Citation2021). Soils have been chronicled as sites of memory and
care (Sharpe Citation2018; Moulton Citation2021), connection to place
and ancestors (Reese Citation2019; Moulton Citation2021), and sites of
resistance and resilience (Jones Citation2019; McCutcheon Citation2019;
Reese Citation2019). In addition to this necessary reframing of Black
connections to soils, ecologists Suzanne Pierre and the Critical Ecology
Lab (Citation2021) are working to highlight the long-term impacts that
slavery had on soils and plant communities throughout the Black
diaspora. These examples shed light on what it might look like to bring
earnest engagements with critical approaches to histories and the
present of Black subjugation, living, and struggle to environmental
science and vice versa.

### Humanism Good

#### Their method replicates [discourses]{.underline} of anti-humanism that preclude organizing for a [common planetary future]{.underline}. Humanism is [redeemable]{.underline}.

**Brennan and Odeh, 23**---professor of comparative literature, cultural
studies, and English at the University of Minnesota; assistant professor

The tragedy of [the post-structuralist counter-reformation]{.underline}
is that it [popularized the idea]{.underline} -- [widespread in
**neo-Orientalist discourses**]{.underline} like decoloniality and late
subaltern studies -- [that humanism is the **core logic** of
Eurocentrism]{.underline}. On the contrary, [it is]{.underline} really
post- or [**[anti-humanism]{.mark}** that [is the **defining credo** of
modern]{.mark} capitalism and]{.underline}, by extension, [the
swaggering Eurocentrism of the American [empire]{.mark}]{.underline} and
its Natopolitan handmaidens. [[What do the would-be masters]{.mark} of
the universe]{.underline} -- western heads of state, International
Monetary Fund (IMF) directors, Wall Street power brokers, and the army
of journalists and think-tank pundits who serve them -- [[believe in if
not]{.mark} the **[disposability]{.mark}** of human life]{.underline},
[the **[unfreedom]{.mark}** of social actors]{.underline}, [the
**insignificance** of experiential holism]{.underline}, [[or the
**irrelevance** of]{.underline}]{.mark} non-instrumental learning,
critical thought, higher ideals: [[the
**humanities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in short[?]{.underline} [One of
their principal initiatives is the perfection of]{.underline} artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**), which at its lowest levels means
automation (and therefore mass unemployment) but at its most utopian
heights means [the **dream** of a post-human]{.underline}: [a
programmable substitute for actual humans]{.underline} that does not
complain, makes no demands, and needs no food. [Far from these
contentions]{.underline}, [humanism]{.underline}, we would have to say,
[is]{.underline} on the dissident Left. It is, as far as I can see,
**[the only Left there is]{.underline}**; or, put differently, [there
can be **no genuine Left** that is not humanist]{.underline}.

One of the refuges of [critiques]{.underline} like Hallaq's is its
deceptive use [of]{.underline} the term "**[modernity]{.underline}**",
which can, of course, mean different things. He depends on our hearing
in the term (and rightly so) [the violence of **conquest**]{.underline},
the forced conversions, the bumptious posing of Mind and Text over
bodies and beliefs, the supercilious scientific swagger of [the
**western war machine**]{.underline}. But what Hallaq really
[want]{.underline}s is [to dispense with modernity in a]{.underline}
quite [**different** sense]{.underline}: [the critique of religious
thought]{.underline}, [the questioning of traditional
authority]{.underline}, [the creation of one's own values out of oneself
according to shifting contexts]{.underline} -- **[Enlightenment
reason]{.underline}**, in short, [in its broadest sense]{.underline}:
that is, [the **revolutionary** Enlightenment]{.underline} of Baruch
Spinoza, Marx, Vico, Hegel, and Rousseau, [not only the
**racist**]{.underline} rationalisms of [Enlightenment]{.underline}
figures like David Hume, François-Marie Arouet, known as Voltaire, or
Edmund Burke. He does this because of his own religious convictions,
which he then wishes to equate (because they are purportedly
non-western) with resistance to western oppression.

[[Humanism is]{.mark} a [non-western]{.mark} philosophy [**every bit as
much** as]{.mark} a [European]{.mark} one]{.underline}. [It belongs
to]{.underline} the maverick secularity of Thales of Miletus and
Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, the philological study of Roman law in Marcus
Terentius Varro, the preservation of oriental learning in [the **Islamic
Golden Age**]{.underline} (Averroes of Cordoba, Avicenna of Persia), the
great rediscovery of Egypt in Neoplatonism, the creation by
scholasticism of the first European universities, [the madrasas of the
**Maghreb** and the **Levant**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
triumph of reading in the Italian renaissance of Poggio Bracciolini and
Desiderius Erasmus, [the]{.underline} great philological [sociologies of
**Ibn Khaldun**]{.underline}, and later, in an identical spirit, Vico.
[I call]{.underline} "**[decoloniality]{.underline}**" (in the work of
Walter Mignolo and Aníbal Quijano) [and]{.underline} late **[[subaltern
studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Chakrabarty)
"**[Orientalist]{.underline}**" advisedly. [It is not a **gratuitous
insult** but a **sober description**]{.underline}. [Both
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Orientalists do, [that [the
non-western subject is **epistemologically other**]{.mark} vis-à-vis the
western subject [as a matter of
**ontology**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They]{.underline} -- we --
[are **fundamentally incongruent**]{.underline}, in their view.
[[This]{.mark} pernicious notion [renders]{.mark} the **[common
humanity]{.mark}** of the world's peoples
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and confuses **geopolitical
conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [perpetrated not by all
Europeans]{.underline} ([or Americans]{.underline}) [but by their
wealthy leaders]{.underline}, [[with **existential differences**]{.mark}
between every individual of the respective camps]{.underline}.

TAO:

Ecocriticism is a vibrant and inexhaustible discipline of World
Literature, but it has been more or less co-opted by high-profile
literary acolytes and practitioners. Despite the vital geopolitical role
played by oil within the global system, Amitav Ghosh reminds us that the
oil encounter has been overlooked in World Literature compared, say,
with the early spice trade. In a similar fashion, Rob Nixon
(Citation2011) maintains that oil has been central to global US imperial
anxiety (72). Apart from Munif's Cities of Salt and a few other
neglected literary works, it seems that Nixon is right when he points
out that most of the environmental literary anthologies of World
Literature function "as an offshoot of American studies" (235). How far
are these analyses relevant to the canonization of environmental studies
and World Literature?

TB:

In addition to Nixon, I can think of several critics -- Graeme
MacDonald, Mike Niblett, Sharae Deckard, Imre Szeman -- who have focused
on the "oil novel" within the context of World Literature. In the pages
of their work, one will find a list of novels that are doing what Ghosh
says is not being done. All the same, Nixon is right that, despite its
overfamiliarity, oil is still the prime mover, and one might extend his
comment to call it also the proximate cause of the violent redrawing of
the Middle East map by US military brutality and its Israeli client
state, as well as the NATO \[North Atlantic Treaty Organization\]
invasion and destruction of Libya (and the assassination of the defiant
Muammar al-Qaddafi), the criminal blockade of Venezuela, and the stoking
of Nigeria's civil war. Simply because an explanation is obvious does
not mean it is untrue.

[[The]{.mark} biggest [danger]{.mark}]{.underline}, though, in the drift
of ecocriticism [[is]{.mark} not so much]{.underline} its
**[depoliticization]{.underline}** at the hands of the overly "literary"
or its colonization by American studies, [but an [**apocalyptic
anti-humanism** that considers]{.mark}]{.underline} all members of [[our
**species** the]{.underline}]{.mark} insouciant [[culprits of
**planetary decline**]{.mark} rather than agribusiness]{.underline},
[logging companies]{.underline}, [weapons manufacturers]{.underline},
[chemical plants]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} -- of course -- [the
oil industry]{.underline}. "We" do not destroy the planet, even if we
currently drive cars, fly in airplanes, put our laundry in dryers, or
take long showers. Capitalism has every incentive not to address
ecological catastrophe, and every motive to exacerbate it. [[So long as
this]{.underline}]{.mark} criminal operation [is]{.underline} [allowed
to [continue]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the planet will
die]{.underline}**]{.mark}. I share the analysis of Harrison Fluss and
Landon Frimm (Citation2021) in their Prometheus and Gaia. Apart from
offering a remarkable map of every byway of recent eco debates, it
observes that Earth-first Gaians, on the one hand, and
techno-enthusiasts, on the other, who think technology will solve all
the problems technology created in the first place, are two sides of the
same misanthropic coin. [[Humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other
hand -- [[with its]{.mark} sense of having an
**[active]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[ethical
choice]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- [[offers a]{.mark} **much [better
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The only one, in fact.

55\. [We must address [a]{.mark}]{.underline} creeping [[**concern**
some]{.underline}]{.mark} readers [may [have with]{.mark} the
[**language** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the Enlightenment. Concepts such
as \'reason\', \'maturity\', and [even **[\'humanity\']{.mark}**
itself]{.underline}, have been battered by unceasing waves of critique
over the past century, for entirely understandable reasons: [the
[**universalist** goals]{.mark}]{.underline} set by the
Enlighteners---from the ideal [of **emancipation** to]{.underline} that
of [progress]{.underline} itself---[[were **tarnished**
by]{.underline}]{.mark} their own variously [**[racist]{.mark}**,
classist]{.underline}, and androcentric [[**failures** to live up to
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Worse still, [the]{.underline} historical
[Enlightenment is]{.underline} forever [**besmirched** with
its]{.underline} entanglement and [**complicity** with]{.underline} the
horrifying legacy of European [colonialism.
**[However]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Enlightenment [[**universalism**
failed]{.mark} precisely **[because it wasn\'t universal]{.mark}**
enough. [A **genuine justifying reason** for an
**action**]{.mark}]{.underline} or institution [[is **meant** to
be]{.mark} a justifying reason [**for anyone** and **everyone**,
regardless of]{.mark}]{.underline} who they are or where they are from,
and this is what immunises the authority of reason against the
corruptions and tyrannies of more [[**arbitrary** seats
of]{.underline}]{.mark} power (such as tradition, bloodline, tribe,
[[**race**, or **nation**]{.underline}]{.mark}). Nonetheless,
[[our]{.underline}]{.mark} own wretched fallibility throughout our past,
our [[failure to **live up** to our]{.mark} own [**ideals**, is **no
indictment** of]{.mark} the [values we **pursue**. To think
**otherwise** would]{.mark} be to **[reduce]{.mark}** the promise of
[**humankind** to]{.mark} the scale of [its **former
errancies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With grave risks clouding our
species\'s horizon and our existence seeming more precarious by the day,
it is easy to become disillusioned by the [[progressive
promises]{.underline}]{.mark} of rationality---yet rationality
[[is]{.mark}, **ultimately**, [nothing]{.mark} other [than]{.mark} the
task of [transforming everything **unjust** into what is
**just**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in institutions and beliefs alike- and
this applies equally strongly to reason\'s on history and even---as we
shall see below-to our entire blind and purposeless past.

#### Liberal humanism is [good]{.underline}.

Barbara. "Adventures in the anti-humanist dialectic: Towards the
reappropriation of humanism." European Journal of Social Theory 1--20.

The second narrative thread in the foregoing discussion concerns the
intimately connected issue of the impoverished understanding of humanism
itself that predominates in the anti-humanist tradition. [[What is
readily apparent in the critical discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} under
discussion here [is the routine reduction of humanism to Cartesianism
plain and simple]{.underline}: that is, to a naive philosophy of the
subject and to an inescapably ethnocentric and restrictive philosophical
anthropology that tends to go with it. As already noted, this reduction
takes place despite the reappearance, in denuded and mystified form, of
many of the humanist themes associated with these positions. But **[what
is most important here is [the lack of any]{.mark} kind detailed
[analysis of]{.mark} instances of [humanism]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. [[Humanism tends to function]{.underline}]{.mark}
in these accounts **[[as merely an empty
signifier]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [[a caricature abstracted
from]{.underline}]{.mark} historical [[**context** and stripped
of]{.underline}]{.mark} all diversity and
**[[nuance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this sense, we can say that [the
idealism that marks the substantive analyses characteristic within the
paradigm arranged around the anti-humanist thematic is magnified when it
comes to the issue of humanism.]{.underline} Foucault constitutes a case
in point. Despite what is a more extended textual engagement in works
such as The Order of Things, Foucault's highly [reductive reading of
humanism]{.underline} in What is Enlightenment? -- as separated from and
opposed to what he takes to be the Enlightenment ethos of 'critique' --
[exemplifies the ideological nature of the critical discourse on
humanism]{.underline}. [[In defining humanism]{.mark} not as a
practice]{.underline} (in his earlier writings it certainly was, albeit
a repressive practice concerned with the extension of 'disciplinary
mechanisms') [but merely [as]{.mark} a set of [themes]{.mark} concerned
with justifying anterior anthropological concerns, Foucault [ignores
the]{.mark} practically and ideologically **[emancipatory role]{.mark}
that [humanism]{.mark} has [played in liberatory struggles]{.mark} at
numerous points [in history]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Certainly, [Foucault
does refer to the tradition of Marxist humanism, for instance, but [he
offers nothing in the way of]{.mark} a serious analysis of that
tradition, not to mention the [**feminist** or **anti-colonial**
traditions of **humanism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Humanism is simply
written off]{.underline}]{.mark}** as something that is incapable of the
kind of self-reflexive form of criticality that Foucault valorises. From
an even cursory look at these traditions, however, it is clear that
[**[humanism can]{.underline}**]{.mark} also **[[be]{.mark} a form of
[critical]{.mark} practice]{.underline}**. Had Foucault paid greater
heed to Merleau-Ponty, for instance, he would have heard humanism
defined as precisely the interrogative ethos that he claims for his own
position: one concerned with 'what is problematic in our own existence
and in that of the world, to such a point that we shall never be cured
of searching for a solution' (Merleau-Ponty, 1963, p. 44). **[The
Marxist humanist tradition]{.underline}** in general -- [and
[thinkers]{.mark} such as Raya Dunayevksaya, Erich Fromm, **Frantz
Fanon, Aimé Césaire**]{.underline}-- [[combine]{.mark}s]{.underline} a
[[concern for **liberation**]{.underline}]{.mark} (not merely
'resistance') [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} a similarly reflexive,
[critical [relationship to]{.mark} the historical constitution of real
live [human]{.mark} beings]{.underline}. There are different valences of
criticality here and varying levels of engagement with philosophical
anthropology and other aspects associated with classical humanism; but
**[[what is central]{.underline}]{.mark}** to all
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} (a) [[a stress on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
critical role that **[[humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}** can offer
[[in]{.mark} its appeal to [realising a different future
and]{.mark}]{.underline} (b) [[the stress on **human agency** as the
basis]{.mark} upon which that different future might be
realised]{.underline}. In each instance, the politics that issues from
the constitutive [[humanism in question is grounded in the real lived
life of individuals and groups]{.underline}]{.mark}, in practical
movements of various stripes [[that fought against]{.underline}]{.mark},
for instance, **[[fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Stalinism,
[**[colonialism, patriarchy and]{.underline}**]{.mark} of course
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

abroad]{.underline}, all the [while suppressing political
dissent]{.underline} at home (Chang 2002; Cole et at. 2002).
[These]{.underline} anxieties [are [undergirded by **racist and
religious chauvinism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, by the self-righteous and
veiled references of these rulers to themselves as a kind of terrible
and terrorizing hand of God, appointed to rid the world of evil (Ahmad
2002; Arnin 2001; Blum1995). At the same time, [[in this context
of]{.mark} turmoil and terror and the use and threatened use of
**catastrophic weapons**, there is the irrational and arrogant
**expectation** that the **oppressed** will acquiesce, **abandon
resistance**, and **accept** the disruptive and devastating consequences
of **globalization**, along with]{.underline} the [global
hegemony]{.underline} it implies (Martin and Schumann 1997). There is
great alarm among the white-supremicist rulers of these globalizing
nations, given the metical resistance rising up against them, even as
[globalization's technological, organizational, and economic capacity
continues to expand]{.underline} (Barber 1996; Karenga 2002e, 2003a;
Lusane 1997). There is great alarm when [[people]{.underline}]{.mark}
who [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} \"know\" when they are defeated
ridicule the assessment, **[[refuse to be
defeated]{.underline}]{.mark}** or dispirited, **[[and]{.mark}, on the
contrary, [intensify]{.mark} and diversify [their
struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Zepezauer 2002). Certainly the
battlefields of [[Palestine, Venezuela]{.underline}]{.mark}, long
suffering [[Haiti, and]{.underline}]{.mark} Chiapas,
[[Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with other [[continuing
**emancipatory struggles**]{.mark} everywhere, [**reaffirm the
indomitable character of the human spirit** and]{.mark} the
[**durability** and **adaptive vitality** of]{.mark} a [people
**determined to be free**, **regardless of the
odds**]{.mark}]{.underline} and assessments [against them]{.underline}.
Indeed, they remind us that [the motive force of history is struggle,
informed by the **ongoing quest for freedom, justice, power of the
masses, and peace** in the world]{.underline}. Despite \"end of
history\" claims and single-super- power resolve and resolutions, these
struggles continue. For still [the oppressed want freedom]{.underline},
the wronged and injured want justice, the people want power over their
destiny and daily lives, and the world wants peace. And all over the
world-[especially in this U.S]{.underline}. citadel [of aging
capitalism]{.underline} with its archaic dreams of empire-clarity in the
analysis of issues, and in the critical determination of tasks and
prospects, [requires the deep and disciplined reflection characteristic
of the personal and social practice]{.underline} we call philosophy. But
this sense of added [[urgency]{.underline}]{.mark} for effective
intervention [[is prompted]{.mark} not only [by the **critical
juncture**]{.mark} at which we stand but also by an awareness of our
long history of resistance as a people, [because in our **collective
strivings and social struggles** we **seek a new
future**]{.mark}]{.underline} for our people, our descendants, and the
world. Joined also to these conditions and considerations is the
compelling character of our self-understanding as a people, as a moral
vanguard in this country and the world. For [we have launched, fought,
and won with our allies [struggles]{.mark} that not only [have
**expanded** the **realm of freedom**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
country and the world but also have [served as [an]{.mark} ongoing
[inspiration and]{.mark} a **[model of liberation]{.mark}** struggles
[for other]{.mark} marginalized and [oppressed peoples]{.mark} and
groups]{.underline} throughout the world. Indeed, they have borrowed
from and built on our moral vocabulary and moral vision, sung our songs
of freedom, and held up our struggle for liberation as a model to
emulate. Now, [self-understanding and self-assertion are dialectically
linked]{.underline}. In other words, [how we understand ourselves in the
world determines how we assert ourselves in the world]{.underline}.
Thus, [an expansive concept of ourselves as Africans-continental and
diasporan-and as Africana philosophers forms an essential component of
our sense of mission and the urgency]{.underline} with which we approach
it. It is important to note that I have conceived and written this
chapter within the framework of Kausaida philosophy (Karenga 1978, 1980,
1997) [Kawaida]{.underline} is a philosophic initiative that [was forged
in the crucible of ideological and practical struggles around issues of
freedom, justice, equalitys, self-determination, conullunal power,
self-defense, pan\~African- ism, coalition and alliance, Black Studies,
intellectual emancipation, and cultural recovery and
reconstlouction]{.underline}. It continued to develop in the midst of
these ongoing struggies within the life of the mind and stmggles iottbtn
the life of the people, as well as within the context of the conditions
of the world. Kawaida is defined as an ongoing synthesis of the best of
xAfrican thought and practice in constant exchange tuttb tl3e \'U)()ltd.
[It characterizes culture as a unique, instructive and valuable way of
being human in the world-as a foundation and framework for
self-understanding and self-assertion]{.underline}. As a philosophy of
culture and struggle, Kawaida maintains that [[our intellectual and
social practice]{.underline}]{.mark} as Nricana activist scholars
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} be undergirded and informed by ongoing
efforts to (1) ground our- selves in our own culture; (2) [[constantly
recover, reconstruct, .and bring forth]{.mark} from our culture the best
of [what it means to be ]{.mark}]{.underline}African and [[**human** in
the **fullest sense**]{.underline}]{.mark}; (3) speak this special
cultural truth to the world and (4) use our culture to constantly make
our own unique contribution to the reconception and reconstruction of
this country, [and to the forward flow of human history]{.underline}.

### Ontology Bad\-\--1NC

#### Theorizing Blackness as geologic is [reductive]{.underline}.

**Crews, 19**---Ph.D. candidate, The New School for Social Research
(Christopher, "Social Movements and Earthbound People: Towards a New
Politics of the Earth in the Anthropocene,"
[[https://www.proquest.com/docview/2268563918]{.underline}](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2268563918),
dml)

A third critical reading of the Anthropocene which has received less
attention, but offers interesting food for thought, is Kathryn Yusoff's
White Geology and Black Anthropocenes. "White Geology makes legible a
set of extractions, from particular subject positions, from black and
brown bodies, and from the ecologies of place...the semiotics of White
Geology creates atemporal materiality dislocated from place and time---a
mythology of disassociation in the formation of matter independent of
its languages of description and the historical constitution of its
social relations" (Yusoff 4). [For **Yusoff**]{.underline}, the origins
of [**all** geologic practices and thoughts are grounded in an
anti-Black racial and colonial politics]{.underline}, an argument she
makes by reading the mining and extraction of "inhuman" geologic
matter---black oil and black coal---a biopolitical process of governance
[which **transforms** Black bodies and Blackness itself into a symbol of
that which is **inhuman**]{.underline}, [and thus **extractable** as
slave labor]{.underline}. This process happens through a racialized
geo-logic of whiteness, which she refers to as White Geology. [In her
view]{.underline}, [[slavery]{.mark} functioned [as]{.mark}]{.underline}
"[[a **geologic axiom**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the inhuman in which
nonbeing was made, reproduced, and circulated as flesh\...To trace
racial matterings across the category of the inhuman, and specifically
the traffic between inhuman as matter and the inhuman as race, is to
examine how the concept of the inhuman is a connective hinge in the
twinned discourses of geology and humanism. It is a hinge that
establishes an extractive axis in both subjective and geologic (or
planetary) life" (Yusoff 4).

I am very sympathetic to Yusoff's underlying political project to put
Black feminist, decolonial and settler colonial scholarship into
critical conversation with the Anthropocene, as this remains a huge
blind spot in Anthropocene discourses. Yet [I find parts of her
theoretical approach **deeply problematic**]{.underline}, such as the
way [she attempts to **[reduce]{.mark}** the [history]{.mark} of geology
and the Anthropocene [to a comparison between]{.mark} inhuman
[**matter** and]{.mark} inhuman **[Black bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Yet [this is a **critical**]{.underline} "**[hinge]{.underline}**" [that
**must be accepted** for her argument to work]{.underline}. [I'm **not
convinced it does**]{.underline}, not least in part because [practices
of [slavery]{.mark} **clearly [predate]{.mark}** [geologic ideas by
**thousands** of years]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet in other areas her work is genuinely insightful, teasing out the
ways in which (largely Black) enslaved bodies were rendered "inhuman"
through historical processes of labor extraction for colonial mining and
plantation labor. Yet [it is hard to overlook
[aspects]{.mark}]{.underline} of her argument [that feel **forced** and
**overly reductive**]{.underline}, as in the following passage, [which
seems to **[erase]{.mark}** as many [Anthropocene histories]{.mark} as
it claims to uncover [by **reducing 500 years**]{.mark} **of complex
world history**]{.underline}.

The very "matter" of territorial impulse that materially compromised the
Anthropocene is anti-Blackness; it is racialized matter that delivers
the Anthropocene as a geologic event into the world, through mining,
plantations, railroads, labor, and energy. While Blackness is the energy
and flesh of the Anthropocene, it is excluded from the wealth of its
accumulation. Rather, Blackness must absorb the excess of the surplus as
toxicity, pollution, and intensification of storms. Again, and again.
(Yusoff 82)

There is no doubt that the legacy of slavery in the United States of
other European colonial nations has created issues of intergenerational
inequity and racial disparities between Blacks and whites that continue
to manifest; the birth of the environmental justice movement testifies
to that. Yet these same [[histories]{.mark} of racial
injustice]{.underline} ([and Indigenous dispossessions]{.underline})
[**[transcend]{.mark}** simple [Black-white
binaries]{.mark}]{.underline} as proposed here by Yusoff, and my worry
is that [this reading of a Black aesthetic politics]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} "**[geo-Poethics]{.underline}**" as she calls it, [does
a **disservice** to]{.underline} the [complicated histories]{.underline}
her work tries to engage with. Despite these reservations, Yusoff's work
is another important example of how scholars are critically analyzing
the Anthropocene in new and innovative ways.

not just in a new story about the relationship of Indigenous history and
colonialism and the question of what weight to assign to different human

side effect of this narrative is to trouble our naive certainty about

who was acted on; What was cause, and what was effect?]{.underline} For
if a bison economy itself helped shape the specific severity of disease
epidemics by concentrating unusually large numbers of people in a

Above all, [we need to add new complexity to how we understand

EROTICS OF SOVEREIGN AND UNSOVEREIGN SELVES

[Native studies]{.underline}, more than any "oppositional" field in the
academy, [has grappled with the notion of **sovereignty** along its
multiple political and philosophical valences]{.underline}. Although
Native studies has spent a great deal of its scholarly and
interdisciplinary effort defining the term, there are multiple notions
of sovereignty in play at any one time. Acknowledging the term's roots
in Western political and philosophical discourse, Michelle Raheja argues
that "sovereignty is additionally an English language placeholder term
structuring a vast number of ways that Native people have for tens of
thousands of years conceived of their relations to human, non-human
animals, the land, ecology."25 [[**Native sovereignty** is]{.mark} a
living and **[dynamic]{.mark}** concept [in]{.mark} **constant
[flux]{.mark}**. While the recognition of Native land claims, treaties,
and systems of governance; the fight for cultural sustainability; and
the right to self-determination anchor many struggles for sovereignty,
the definition of "sovereignty" continues to be
**contested**]{.underline}. Leanne Simpson emphasizes that "sovereignty
for indigenous people is not an abstract political concept, it is an
intimate lived concept."26 Native movements for sovereignty are diverse,
plural, and often in tension.

Taiaiake [Alfred and]{.underline} Glen [Coulthard]{.underline}, for
example, [have]{.underline} each [argued that framing **Indigenous
struggles** in terms of **sovereignty** leads Indigenous politics to
cooptation by the state]{.underline}.27 These two scholars adopt the
notion of resurgence instead of sovereignty. In light of this critique,
[[**Native people** have not]{.mark} **fully [rejected]{.mark}** the
term "[sovereignty" but **refined it**]{.mark} (time and time again) [to
distinguish **Indigenous sovereignty**]{.mark}]{.underline} from state
and patriarchal power.28 Native feminist claims of sexism and misogyny
have also posed challenges to how "sovereignty" has been defined by
Native nations. Native women's activism within Native communities and
nations that have challenged the "internalization of colonial gender
norms" is a form of sovereignty that forced other, older forms of
sovereignty to change.29 As Stephanie Teves, Andrea Smith, and Michelle
Raheja write, "Many Native activists are envisioning what sovereignty
would look like if it were based on principles of justice for all
peoples and care for all of creation." 30 These debates around the
meaning of "sovereignty" demonstrate the extent to which it is an
open-ended term. As Joanne Barker notes, "[[Sovereignty is]{.mark}
**historically [contingent]{.mark}**]{.underline}."31

Teves and her colleagues acknowledge that [Indigenous [movements for
**self-determination**]{.mark} and **sovereignty** have always [been
porous]{.mark} and [informed by **other movements**]{.mark}. For
instance, the **[Red Power]{.mark}** movement was [informed by]{.mark}
the "strategies and tactics of the **[Black Power]{.mark}**
movement]{.underline}s. . . . [This [exchange helped]{.mark}
**[facilitate]{.mark}** broader [support for]{.mark} **[Native
struggles]{.mark}** and [enabled other groups to **integrate**]{.mark}
and understanding of [**settler colonialism** into their
struggles]{.mark}]{.underline}."32 Discussions of the malleability and
porosity of the Native notion of sovereignty are perhaps the space where
it is most capacious. This is often the test that Black studies scholars
apply to the politics of Native sovereignty. Is Native sovereignty a
pliable and ethical enough space to acknowledge the specificity of
anti-Black racism? While Native sovereignty as a concept has stretched
and changed due to the stress of internal pressure, can it change in
relation to Black people's needs and desires? This is a question that is
particularly pertinent when discussing Black and Cherokee relations,
specifically Cherokee practices of slavery. [**Sexton** recently called
into question the notion of Native sovereignty from Black studies as an
interpretive frame, critiquing settler colonial studies and, to some
extent, traditions within Native studies for relenting to notions of
"resurgence, recovery and recuperation," which have what **Wilderson**
calls the "capacity for coherence" and are therefore intelligible within
liberal humanist frames of recognition]{.underline}.33

In contrast, what Sexton defines as a "politics of abolition," which
calls for the end to slavery (and its afterlife), is a call for the
radicalization of Indigenous sovereignty, as well as every radical
movement.34 For Sexton, the radicalization that abolition exerts is a
"radicalization through the perverse affirmation of a deracination, an
uprooting of the natal, the nation, and the notion, preventing any order
of determination from taking root, a politics without a claim, without
demand even, or a politics whose demand is too radical to be formulated
in advance of its deeds."35 His articulation of abolition's "baseless
politics" sets the stage for a renunciation of the self and, more
specifically, a self that can even claim sovereignty.36 As this critique
has been engaged and carefully considered, an important critique of
**[[Sexton's position]{.underline}]{.mark}** is that it [[is **too
abstract**]{.mark} and [functions outside]{.mark} a
**[specific]{.mark}** and **material [context]{.mark}**]{.underline}.37
For example, [it [does not]{.mark} adequately [attend to]{.mark} the
[question, "**For whom**]{.mark} **is [sovereignty important]{.mark} and
in [what moment]{.mark}?**"]{.underline}38

The "who" and the "what moment" illumine how sovereignty is being
enacted when the discourse and practice of sovereignty come face to face
with Black abolitionist projects. Andrew K. [Frank argues that the
[**sovereignty** of **Muskogee Creek villages**]{.mark} in Florida
during the eighteenth century [protected **fugitive slaves** an]{.mark}d
other [**absconders** from]{.mark} Spanish and British
[colonies]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 Can sovereignty, particularly a
sovereignty that can expand and even dissolve the borders of the self to
invite the other---Black fugitive slaves in this occasion---in and then
consolidate those same borders to prevent British slave catchers from
penetrating its space function as an ethical enactment of sovereignty?
If at its core Indigenous sovereignty morphs along its axes of
relationality and "interconnectedness," can Native sovereignty function
as a malleable analytic that Black and Native erotics can bend, curl,
and reshape toward a mutual futurity?40 More specifically, can Native
sovereignty bring about a porous notion of self that opens itself to
accepting the erotic potential of the other---in this case, Black,
flight, porosity, and chaos. While erotically working on this erotic
space, could a new space emerge that exceeds and no longer fits within
the discourse or the "placeholder" currently called "sovereignty"? Might
a new grammar emerge at the erotic shoals of Black and Native porous
futures?

#### Blackness and being are not ontologically intertwined 

Dr. Victor **Peterson II 22**, PhD, Adjunct Instructor, Black Cultural
Studies, New York University, \"Paradoxes of The Always Already,\" The
Philosophical Forum, Forthcoming, 03/02/2022, Wiley Online Library.
\[italics in original\]

As of late there is a school of thought in cultural studies that states
that a particular form of subjectivity is 'always already' abject. This
[pessimist view follows]{.underline} from [the
[claim]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the condition of its subject
is]{.underline} **[[social death]{.underline}]{.mark}**; that is to say,
[this subject is]{.underline} '**[natally alienated]{.underline}**.'
This [assertion ushers in a]{.underline} rather
**[technical]{.underline}** [formalisation of the concept]{.underline}
of the 'always already' by scholars in support of this view as well as
in optimistic opposition (Moten, 2003, 2017; Sexton, 2016; Wilderson,
2020). Natal alienation [[implies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the
[subject]{.mark} before its]{.underline} **[instantiation]{.underline}**
[[is]{.mark} marked as the [abject]{.mark}, as a]{.underline}
**[non-member]{.underline}** member of our state of affairs. By always
already being the abject with respect to each instantiation of that form
of subjectivity, [there is]{.underline} also [instantiated the
boundaries required by the non-abject to]{.underline} claim or
**[recognise]{.underline}** [themselves with respect to what
is]{.underline} **[negated]{.underline}** [from categories
they]{.underline} have [established]{.underline}. These negated, then,
are those whose participation by way of their modes of expression is not
licensed by the models the non-abject use to organise that state of
affairs. As a result, [the pessimist states that there
must]{.underline}, '**[by necessity']{.underline}**, always be an
outgroup. This outgroup holds together the categories it surrounds both
conceptually and actually (see, interestingly enough, Unauthored, 2017).
This [analytic distinction]{.underline} **[necessarily]{.underline}**
[posits the abject whenever an entity is]{.underline}
**[instantiated]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} respect to [that
model]{.underline}. Necessity is already a modally contentious notion
when considered by way of universal quantification; however, [pessimism
[licenses a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[logical
scaffolding]{.underline}**]{.mark} upon [which it is claimed [that
if]{.mark} a framework is [coherent]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [its
[antithesis]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[must]{.underline}** [be
instantiated]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This]{.underline} of course [leads
to a]{.underline} **[host of issues]{.underline}**. One of which
[licenses]{.underline} **[implausible]{.underline}** [statements the
likes of our mortality proving Christ\'s immortality given
our]{.underline} own [non-divinity]{.underline} (Bright, 2021).
Pessimism purports that because its system is coherent, then its subject
is not.

Afropessimism, an argument following Orlando Patterson\'s *Slavery and
Social Death*, (1982) inspires extensive scholarship. For Patterson,
Blacks are cultural-politically recognised despite pessimism\'s claims.
So, Patterson finds 'irony' in pessimists using his work (Mineo with
Patterson, 2018). Afropessimism does, however, explain instances of
persistent segregation resulting from slavery but claims that Blacks'
position, socio-politically and consciously, remains such. For example,
despite increases in Black representation at different levels of
government, with sections of the 1965 U.S. Voting Rights Act overturned
in 2013, the resultant redrawing of voting districts aligns with
pessimist readings of an historically contiguous devalorisation of the
power/value of Black representatives'/constituencies'. By negating that
speech-act before enactment, coalitions across voting-groups are
foreclosed, the policing of those zones' boundaries increase. The
'Black-Vote' is pronounced integral to some political parties yet
negated in the larger system. [For]{.underline}
**[Afropessimism]{.underline}**, devalorisation and [exclusion make
coalitions]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}**
[because]{.underline} the [positions of those recognised
and]{.underline} those that, [by definition, are not for the other to be
so, are]{.underline} '**[incommensurable]{.underline}**.' [Coalition
calls]{.underline} for Black\'s [to]{.underline} **['incorporate'
anti-Black-ness]{.underline}**, [inviting an antinomy that
annihilates]{.underline} its [output]{.underline} (Wilderson, 2020, pp.
222--223).

Afropessimism [proposes a]{.underline} '**[metatheory]{.underline}**'
[of]{.underline} the [['assumptive logics']{.mark} of a system
[encoding]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[particular]{.underline}**
[relationship between entities and]{.underline} entities [to a world
composed of]{.underline} those [relations]{.underline}
(**[[Wilderson]{.mark}, 2020]{.underline}**, p. 14). A logic encodes
relations between statements in accordance with principles that license
certain claims. An [encoding]{.underline} (=model) of [our affairs is
decoded in terms relevant to the]{.underline}
**[condition]{.underline}** [of the receiver]{.underline} (Hall, 1973).
Understanding (=recognition) [occurs when]{.underline}
**[functional-equivalences]{.underline}** [obtain between
terms]{.underline}. [Gaps]{.underline} between encodings/decodings
[highlight how the]{.underline} **[assumptive logics]{.underline}**
organising our state [cut into]{.underline} our [affairs]{.underline}.
It\'s not terms' definition but the embodied decodings structuring
one\'s relation to others and the world that maintain the status quo.
[This brings]{.underline} Frank [Wilderson\'s]{.underline}
**[psycho-social pessimism]{.underline}** [forward]{.underline}. What\'s
decoded is utilised to re-encode experience, filtering what\'s
discursively available for self-expression in virtue of the system
structuring our affairs. Historically, from analyses of
encoding/decoding capacity within Black-ness (Hurston, 1934), [modes of
expression modelling]{.underline} our [modality in the
world]{.underline} **[license]{.underline}** our [study of]{.underline}
the [forms of life]{.underline} **[systemically
attainable]{.underline}** [within that state]{.underline}.

That system\'s mechanics reveal that [[what\'s encoded is]{.mark} what
an object/term is *[for]{.mark}*]{.underline} **[given]{.underline}**
[[certain conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}---relations between object and
context, i.e., function; not object and definition (Hall, 1973). These
[[functions are]{.underline} '**[abstract]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[objects]{.underline}**.' [Relations]{.underline} between domains
(=conditions) and co-domains (=contexts) **[encode]{.underline}**
[objects of thought]{.underline} (Taylor, 1998). The same relation
obtaining between a domain and different co-domains means that objects
similarly utilised are functionally-equivalent with respect to that
domain. The [object of an expression\'s relevancy is
maintained]{.underline} insofar [as a]{.underline}
**[functional-equivalence]{.underline}** holds [across
contexts]{.underline}. Unexpected but functionally-equivalent
output---different appearance, same function---can result, leading to
alternative outcomes in future re/de-codings. Output becoming the input
of subjects' encoding/decoding capacity means that identities are
determined within discourse, not outside of it (Hall, 1996).

**[Alternative]{.underline}** [output is]{.underline}
**[foreclosed]{.underline}** [for pessimists]{.underline}. The
[value/output of modes of expression is]{.underline} **[always already
determined]{.underline}** for, and exclusively universalized to, Blacks.
However, [the sources from which [pessimism]{.mark} pulls show
how]{.underline} **[metaphysical]{.underline}** [concepts made canonical
identities, whose boundaries are]{.underline}
**[cultivated]{.underline}** [to determine who/what fits]{.underline},
indirectly [[install]{.mark} a]{.underline}
'**[[neo-essentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,' [claiming]{.underline}
***[real]{.underline}*** [differences between]{.underline} the
[categories structuring]{.underline} our [discourse]{.underline}
(Wynter, 2006). These [transcendent categories]{.underline} seem to
[[structure discourse]{.underline} **[externally]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Unfortunately, ['essential difference' [precipitates]{.mark}
an]{.underline} **[[infinite regress of binary
distinctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to legitimate instantiated
differences]{.underline} between positions, [ontologically
[committing]{.mark} us [to identities]{.mark} we introduce [by being
not-other]{.mark}]{.underline} (logical issues: Belnap, 1962, Curry\'s
Paradox, Evans, 1978, Prior, 1961; socio-political: Blumer, 1958).

The [over/de-valorisation of positions amongst]{.underline} the
[categories]{.underline} **[structuring]{.underline}** [discourse prior
to any claim is studied by which claims of/to those positions are
licensed]{.underline} (Wynter, 2006). Race prejudice becomes a function
of group position (Blumer, 1958), negotiating what/who is or not by
which claims satisfy the assumptive logics of that system. Pessimism\'s
treatment of systems that open/foreclose expressions, conflating their
(im)possibility with modes of being, can be insightful. For pessimists,
Black expressions/claims are pre-emptively negated. Their negation prior
to formation makes other forms possible. This universally determines
Blacks' role (Sexton, 2010) by re-encoding a psycho-social concept as an
essential property of their physical presence (Wynter, 2006, p. 110). I
argue that [pessimism]{.underline} [**[mistakes]{.underline}** [its
model for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [territory]{.mark} it
represents]{.underline}. '...\[[R\]ole [allocations mapped
onto]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[biological]{.mark}ly
determined]{.underline}** [anatomical [differences]{.mark} ... have been
an]{.underline} **[indispensable]{.underline}** [function of the
instituting]{.underline} of our genres or [sociogenic kinds of being
human]{.underline}' (pp. 114--115).

Wilderson\'s [interpretation of]{.underline} Saidiya
**[Hartman]{.underline}**\'s work (1997) [connects overdetermination to
a]{.underline} **[preconscious alienation]{.underline}** [from their
origin]{.underline} for Blacks. This [inaccessibility is]{.underline}
**[violently]{.underline}** [reproduced, becoming]{.underline}
**[universal]{.underline}** [for that group]{.underline} (Wilderson,
2011). [For]{.underline} Saidiya **[Hartman]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} Hortense **[Spillers]{.underline}**, [their study
of]{.underline} *partus sequitur ventrem*, i.e., [the]{.underline}
**[status]{.underline}** [of slave inherited through the mother, marks a
matrilineal investigation]{.underline} distinct from the patrilineal
(patriarchal) system of inheritance at the time and assumed to be the
case in most studies that followed. Hortense Spillers' work (1987),
which Wilderson references (Hartman & Wilderson, 2003), analysed this
onto-epistemological position\'s emergence as coinciding with modernity.
As such, [the]{.underline} **[middle-passage]{.underline}** [disrupted
vertical transfer for horizontal exchange]{.underline} thereafter
(Spillers, 1987, p. 75). A relationship evolved between various
lineages/lexicons similarly cut at that shared event, wherein terms
operating similarly within their respective lines obtained a
functional-equivalence across the many landing zones of this now
composite groups' modern condition. This set of equivalences
reconstituted an alternative 'origin.' An [[origin conceived
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[functional-equivalence]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[terms utilised across]{.mark} these
[co-domains]{.mark}]{.underline}. A [[lineage]{.underline}]{.mark} from
these re-membered fragments [was]{.underline}
**[re-encoded]{.underline}** [within [diaspora in a different
way]{.mark}]{.underline}; **[alternative terms]{.underline}** [became
collectively relevant across]{.underline} individual but
**[not]{.underline}** mutually [exclusive positions]{.underline}. Across
different zones, a shared memory (see Spillers, 1987). The
[[Pessimist\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} vertical [[derivation, tugged
horizontally]{.underline}]{.mark} at its sources, [[opens a]{.underline}
**[seam]{.underline}** [for our intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[For]{.underline} **[Afropessimism]{.underline}**, then, [Blacks
are]{.underline} **[natally alienated]{.underline}** [from
value-positions always already]{.underline}. Their [negation constitutes
the]{.underline} **[boundaries]{.underline}** [of that
system]{.underline} from outside. Obtaining a position within that frame
leads to contradiction, despite Blacks' status as a non-entity entity
therein, as 'sentient' but 'not Human' (Wilderson, 2011). As a
constitutive element, '...**[natal alienation]{.underline}**---[make the
temporal and spatial logic of the entity and]{.underline} of [setting
untenable, impossible to]{.underline} **[conceive]{.underline}** ([as in
birth) and/or conceive of (as in assume any coherence]{.underline}).'
(Wilderson, 2020) If alienation functions within an onto-epistemological
frame (Silva, 2017), 'its governing sociogenic code (the territory)'
(Wynter, 2006), defining who *is* (Human) or is *not*, then an antinomy
arises at the centre of the mechanism organising our domain, the subsets
of which index particular forms of life. Logically, there are more
subsets than members of a domain, e.g., the set 'even-number' is not a
number though comprised of numbers---see below. Our method analyses
Afropessimism as a metatheory---a theory about systems of
statements/claims---whose own claims, then, apply to it as a theory of
Black-ness. A metatheory indirectly follows the constituting-rules which
its object follows directly and whereby that object\'s output becomes
recognisable in the metatheory (Warren, 2020). I will restrict the
exercise below to this part of pessimism\'s argument, a reflexive
(meta)theory of the logics of a system overdetermining Black-ness
through a 'Black' lens (Wilderson, 2020, p. 14).

Logical treatments questioning pessimism have either been ignored or
said to be irrelevant to the pessimist precisely because their claim
asserts that what follows from their subject\'s instantiation is always
already negated. Therefore, the non-obtainability of the conclusion
makes its claim true, for negating that claim proves their assertion
because their theory posits the falsehood of the subject it
instantiates. [Pessimism\'s]{.underline} [**[doubling
down]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark} [this [logical
error]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [still]{.underline} **[[does not
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Despite]{.underline} their
**[disapproval]{.underline}** [of claims to universal
truth]{.underline}, something which logic itself proves is unattainable
for there is no one logic, [the [pessimist]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[instantiates]{.underline}**]{.mark} [their [claim to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[abject]{.underline}** [from their]{.underline}
**[singular position and universalises]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[their
[theory]{.mark}]{.underline}** [across all possible worlds]{.underline}.
In so doing, their [assertion]{.underline}
**[[evacuates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [their own position of]{.underline}
the [[coherence]{.underline}]{.mark} their framework claims to provide.

Above, we said a function takes input from one domain and pairs it with
output from a sub/co-domain whereby that pair is an element of that
function. This makes a function a sort of abstract object (=object of
thought) (Taylor, 1998). That pair is not an element in the domain or
the range, however, it does relate the two. This makes the function a
non-member member of each. We will make sense of this below, but it is
initially not hard to conceive. Recall, the 'set' of even numbers is not
itself a 'number' yet composed of numbers. So, it is possible to
conceive of a space in which the non-member member resides that is not
empty. Let\'s say that for any formula there is a sentence such that a
framework proves that that sentence holds of the formalisation (=coding)
of that formula in that framework. This can be shown to follow from the
substitution of the subject of that formula with its coding in that
frame. To test this, let there be 1. an open formula, 2. a function
whereby that formula allows the substitution of an object with itself,
3. a frame specific code for that function, and 4. a sentence that is
equivalent to the formalisation (=function) of that code. From this, we
observe that the sentence we seek would be equivalent to the function of
that code, which is also equivalent to the formula in which it is the
case that if one can substitute an object with itself then one can
substitute a code with itself. It follows that if a code can be
substituted with itself, so can the formula producing that code with the
code produced because that formalisation and its code are equivalent in
frame. Thus, the sentence that encodes a formalisation is licensed
within the framework provided and is equivalent with the formula that
now takes the formalisation of that code as its object. As such, that
sentence can be said to be equivalent to its formalisation.

Suppose, then, that there is a theory within that framework
characterising and possibly extending that framework. This theory can be
articulated by a procedure licensed in and only in that frame. Then
there is a formalisation of that theory that proves that theory, that
can be encoded by a sentence in that frame. What if we posit a sentence
that asserts its own unprovability? Following from its instantiation,
there is a sentence that is equivalent to the inability to prove that
sentence\'s means of formalisation. Attempting to save the reader the
pleasure of having to decipher a much shorter formal representation, the
above amounts to a lengthy description of the liar paradox, e.g., 'This
sentence is false', except here we have, 'This sentence is unprovable'.
As a result, we find that if our theory (=framework) is consistent, then
in the process of proving a sentence that asserts its own
unprovability\'s consistency, we would also be able to prove that
theory\'s unprovability. But this is exactly what the theory says! So,
if the theory is consistent, the pessimist\'s statement is unprovable.

It seems that within this model we can formalise how claims refer to
themselves. As such, the 'always already' embedded in the pessimist\'s
claim can be formalised by way of self-reference. It is provable that
the liar paradox instantiates a sentence that says of itself that it is
false. Let\'s now [descend into the]{.underline} veritable ***[System of
Dante\'s Hell]{.underline}*** [proposed by pessimism]{.underline}.
[Recall]{.underline} that [for the pessimist, after a]{.underline}
**[particular]{.underline}** [subject\'s instantiation, everything that
follows]{.underline} from that subject, i.e., its subsequent successive
expressions, including that which instantiated that chain,
[represents]{.underline} **[social death]{.underline}** [because that
subject is]{.underline} **[natally alienated]{.underline}** (=non-member
member of that state). In other words, [each of that subject\'s
expressions says of itself that it is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}**. [[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark}, then,
[a]{.underline} possibly [**[infinite list]{.underline}** [of statements
where each asserts]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[falsity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the latter]{.underline}. These
[sentences]{.underline} still [[involve]{.underline}
**[self-reference]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for they refer to]{.underline}
the **[enumeration]{.underline}** [of the sentences themselves,
[therefore]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[successive]{.mark}
instantiations]{.underline}**. So, if we have a formalisation that
encodes a statement within a particular frame of reference, then
[[each]{.mark} successive instantiation]{.underline} of that
formalisation [is]{.underline} provably **[[equivalent to
another]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and individually equivalent to their
unprovability]{.underline}. Thus, [the]{.underline}
**[consistency]{.underline}** [of the list of statements]{.underline} (=
system of reference) [in total is equivalent to each individual
statement]{.underline}.

As each formalisation of a sentence within that system of statements
claims the unprovability of all statements following it, that frame\'s
scope---quantifying, i.e., evaluating, each statement---is narrowed to
the point that no one thing can fit into the category it instantiates.
But this is exactly what the pessimist and, therefore, the theory itself
proposes for the significance of that statement is that it evacuates
what follows it of all value. So, the frame employed can prove that at
least one of these statements encoding that claim is true, thus every
statement in that system is also true. However, [what that statement
formalises illustrates]{.underline} that [its]{.underline}
[**[negation]{.underline}** [is provable]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
those]{.underline} same [terms, thereby [proving]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[the system]{.mark} employed [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[inconsistent]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline}]{.mark} [is what
[the theory claimed]{.mark} of]{.underline} **[all
statements]{.underline}** [in that system [anyway]{.mark}]{.underline}!
(Yablo, 1993).

From the above, we can surmise that [self-referential
statements]{.underline} **[assert]{.underline}** that [there is a
function of x that is x]{.underline}. Formally, this function is only
valid when x is zero. [This is]{.underline} **[no problem]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} the type of [treatment]{.underline} we pursue in this
paper [for what that function posits is not a]{.underline} **[truth
claim]{.underline}** [but indexes the]{.underline} **[assertability
conditions]{.underline}** [in which self-reference obtains]{.underline},
mainly, and merely, [at]{.underline} their [instantiation]{.underline}
yet [before application in a context successor]{.underline}. Issues
arise from making the subsequent applications of that function
equivalent. These [errors]{.underline} **[compound]{.underline}** [when
enumerating instances of x and stating]{.underline} that [what follows
is]{.underline} **[equivalent]{.underline}** [to the initial
determination]{.underline} of that chain. This posits the value for each
statement to be equivalent to the whole set, much like a move in a game
referencing the entirety of the strategy in which it is employed while
remaining a member of that very same strategy. That strategy either will
not get off the ground, for each move reinstitutes move zero, or is
inconsistent for it and a subsequent instantiation being equivalent
would mean that 0 = 1. To get out of this loop, we find that
instantiation indexes a model that encodes a particular world or 'game
board' view. This model must be made accountable to the axioms by which
the borders of its map were drawn. The [pessimist]{.underline}
**[instantiates]{.underline}** [a map and expands its
borders]{.underline} so that [the map is the territory]{.underline}. The
[map]{.underline}, then, [would be]{.underline} **[blank]{.underline}**.
Without evincing its limitations, not only does accountability become an
issue, but so does usefulness for how are we to understand where and how
that frame does or does not apply? If this model was utilised by
another, they would be unable to explain what landmarks (=concepts) do
or do not emerge as well as their own relation in the territory they
occupy by way of that map (=framework/model). The map\'s key is drawn in
invisible ink.

The above is sure to inspire backlash. Dissenters have claimed that such
a method asserts that logic presumes a universal truth. This amounts to
a universal policy that 'universality' is untenable. However, Black
studies scholar Nahum Chandler (2013) has stated that logic is not of
the sole domain of one discipline or people. Truth is a semantic notion
indexed to the model in which statements' consistency with respect to
each other can be decided. Truth considered as a primary notion doesn\'t
really get us that far save by labeling the models we prefer. Treatments
of the method of constructing these models, their syntax, provides the
means by which certain statements are licensed and others not. This
allows for a theory of truth to emerge, whose extension can be explained
as a function of the extension of the domain in which it applies, which
is opposed to being stipulated without an account for where it came from
save by choice. In fact, we just proved, logically, that a claim of
universal truth is unprovable. Claims that logic itself universalises
truth, or strictly determines the referent of concepts so that one can
disregard alternative modes of analysis, are instantiated as a matter of
policy while also mobilising their own system of thought (=logic) to
their own purposes.

So how does the paradox of the 'always already' play out in the realm of
Cultural studies, Black Cultural studies in particular? According to the
pessimist, [[if]{.mark} your [status is]{.mark} defined by]{.underline}
your **[[\'always already\']{.mark} being
[negated]{.mark}]{.underline}** [from every conceptual
framework]{.underline} that can be posited [save the one in which you
are defined as the negated]{.underline} (already a Russellian paradox),
[then]{.underline} yes, [[there is no framework that leads
to]{.underline}]{.mark} your **[[liberation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
yes, no]{.underline} **[reformative politic]{.underline}**; [[but then
there\'s no purpose for the framework]{.mark} that [you employ because
it]{.mark}]{.underline} has **[[proved its own
unprovability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There\'s [[no]{.mark} point in
[resistance because no politic is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[possible]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [which is the point of
this]{.underline} supposed political [metatheoretical framework
anyway]{.underline}. [This circle]{.underline} just [[leads to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[maintenance of the status quo]{.underline}** [and
benefits those that]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[**[mastered]{.underline}** [this]{.underline}]{.mark} [rhetorical
[manoeuvre]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [cycle\'s resurgence]{.underline}
has been [treated by the concept of]{.underline}
**[informal]{.underline}** [omega inconsistency]{.underline}. In this
case, a group universally agrees to a particular claim and yet a
subgroup, as a matter of policy, systematically denies any instance of
evidence that supports that claim (Bright, 2016). This works in tandem
with a policy that [[defers]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[responsibility
of [verifiability]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to the]{.underline}
**[outgroup]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In the same move, [that outgroup is
placed in conditions in which [they]{.mark} must]{.underline}
**[[explain]{.underline}]{.mark}** [their position
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[a way]{.mark} that [the
ingroup]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[decides]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[whether]{.underline} the [explanation is valid or not in accordance
with dominant views]{.underline}. As a result, [the]{.underline}
**[scope]{.underline}** [of the label]{.underline} that is [meant to
represent the group]{.underline} overall [is]{.underline}
[**[restricted]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[preferences
of the ingroup]{.mark} insofar [as it]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[translates]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
**[[benefits them]{.underline}]{.mark}** [within the overarching system
of categorization]{.underline} (Taiwo, 2020). Soon [one ends up in a
state of affairs in which it is]{.underline} **[worse]{.underline}** [to
be called]{.underline} a [racist than]{.underline} to
**[experience]{.underline}** [racism]{.underline}. The
[[circularity]{.mark} of it]{.underline} all **[[uniquely
sets]{.underline}]{.mark}** up [the claim of [the
in]{.mark}group]{.underline}, now [representative of the whole,
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[deny affinity]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with
any other collection of people [while]{.mark} simultaneously [claiming
their]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[universal role]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[as]{.underline} the [foundation upon which all]{.underline} those
[collections base their value]{.underline} (Wilderson, 2020). It also
makes it easier to extinguish general protest against the status quo by
cutting off the representative head which has already done the work of
silencing those they represent (Robinson, 1980). So why the backlash to
the sort of treatment applied above? It seems to pay to be the expert on
a problem you\'ve instantiated that cannot be solved. 'A living death is
as much a death as it is a living.' (Sexton, 2012).

From the paradoxes above, we find that normalisation does not get us out
of this paradox for the theory itself states that whatever follows it is
false, i.e., ought to be negated and, therefore, is true. Considering
Afropessimism (=Black is always already abject), our formalisation shows
that the property expressed by 'Black'-ness is instantiated by the
function of its operation, its mode of expression. However,
[the]{.underline} **[incompleteness [proof]{.mark}]{.underline}** above
[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the statement]{.underline}
**[instantiated]{.underline}**]{.mark} in that domain and voiding its
instantiation [[is]{.underline} **[not universally
determinate]{.underline}**]{.mark}. The [pessimist\'s
argument]{.underline} **[undercuts itself]{.underline}** [each time
it\'s employed]{.underline}. [Pessimism fails]{.underline} **[even
if]{.underline}** [it admits]{.underline} that [Blackness is possible
but]{.underline} **[always]{.underline}** [as yet
instantiated]{.underline}. This puts Blackness on par with a duppy and
even that would instantiate a form of life obtained by Blacks that
doesn\'t obtain the pessimist\'s position. By pessimism\'s own terms, [a
form of Black life]{.underline} (=Black-ness) [is by
necessity]{.underline} **[instantiated outside]{.underline}** [their
view]{.underline}. [Blackness]{.underline} being [expressed by the mode
in which it is]{.underline} **[in the world]{.underline}** [by virtue of
its modes of]{.underline} **[expression]{.underline}**.

[Some]{.underline} would [say]{.underline} that [the pessimist is making
a]{.underline} [**[psychological]{.underline}**
[claim]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than a]{.underline}
**[normative]{.underline}** [one]{.underline}. Hence our treatment of
Blackness as a problem for thought. However, [this argument]{.underline}
[**[errs]{.underline}** [because we]{.underline}]{.mark} can and
[do]{.underline} **[[coherently]{.underline}]{.mark}** think and
[**[talk]{.underline}** [of non-entities]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, [a]{.underline} **[[useful fiction]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[presenting us with an idealised representation [of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}, which of course is not the world in total,
[can posit a model that helps]{.underline} us [explain]{.underline}
**[actual phenomenon]{.underline}** in the world (Appiah, 2017). Any
[scientific model [admits to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[removing]{.underline}**]{.mark} those [[aspects]{.mark} of the world
that are]{.underline} **[[not crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to what
it\'s analysing]{.underline} only [[to add]{.mark} them]{.underline} in
[[later to see]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[extent]{.underline}** [to
which that model explains phenomena]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world.
Albeit not entities in the world or the world in total,
[entities]{.underline} within those useful fictions [are]{.underline}
nevertheless **[instantiated]{.underline}** [within the model,
making]{.underline} our [explanation of actual entities via
the]{.underline} **[coherence]{.underline}** [of those
concepts]{.underline} qua non-entities **[significant]{.underline}**!
When someone asks you to point to 0 or infinity, it is not a thing that
you point to, but you can formalise how those concepts are expressed by
their mode of construction, i.e., by illustrating their function within
the models we employ to explain concepts that emerge in our world. This
does not license any and everything to be the case for a model\'s value
is determined insofar as it can be shared and its results, when applied
given the conditions it indexes, can be conceived by others. The [issue
with this]{.underline} **[vein of [pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} that [it\'s a 'useful fiction' that]{.underline}
[**[cannot]{.underline}** [be shared]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [consequences of our outline of the framework indicated
by]{.underline} the **['always already']{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
that [it is the case that Blackness is in excess of an identified
instance]{.underline}. This follows from the fact that a property is
understood by the function of its label\'s application with respect to
the contexts in which the object it characterizes obtains (Taylor,
1998). A property of no one thing has no range of application for domain
and range are identical. Self-referentially, if identical to itself,
that property defines the zero of its function\'s domain. Much like the
determination of a function awaiting input, [there\'s]{.underline} **[no
output]{.underline}** [whereby the operation of that function can be
describ]{.underline}ed. [Pessimism holds]{.underline} that,
'\[[b\]ecause blackness is]{.underline} **[supernumerary]{.underline}**,
[it is impossible to speak as black without putting yourself
into]{.underline} an **[unavoidable tension]{.underline}** [with the
condition you]{.underline} would [claim]{.underline}. Speaking as black
... cannot allow you to represent your condition, as speaking is enough
to make you unrepresentative' (Sexton, 2011, pp. 37--38). However, we
have shown that [we can]{.underline} **[formalise]{.underline}**
[Blackness without having to]{.underline} **[identify it]{.underline}**
[with a singular instance]{.underline}. Formalising it in negation to
some other can be helpful but is not the entire story. [A [function
where]{.mark}by an object is that [object posits]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [function as [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mode of
expressing]{.underline}**]{.mark}, i.e., characterising, that object in
that instance. After that function\'s application, [that object
of]{.underline} **[thought]{.underline}**---recall how functions were
defined above---[references its]{.underline} mode of
**[expression]{.underline}**, i.e., [the conditions in
which]{.underline} that [function was determined and]{.underline}
thereby [determining where its application is appropriate]{.underline},
not the thing from which it was abstracted. As that function, in itself,
i.e., self-referentially, represents that line of successive
application\'s zero, [that instance [marks]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[conditions by which]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[object-ness]{.mark}
of that object [can be explained]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
[function]{.underline}, then, [becomes the]{.underline}
**[content]{.underline}** [of the predicate by which we
understand]{.underline} that [that object is the case and whose
extension maps the]{.underline} **[range of contexts]{.underline}**
(=sub/co-domains) in which that predicate\'s application is appropriate
because its use references those initial conditions.

A [functional reading shows how]{.underline} a **[mode of
expression]{.underline}** [can]{.underline} somehow [be
determined]{.underline} **[before]{.underline}** [application because it
is the subject it expresses]{.underline}. Thus, a function whose
operation expresses the concept we seek is both a part of and yet apart
from each domain it instantiates for it is how that domain was
constructed. It follows that [functions can be equivalent]{.underline}
**[before]{.underline}** [application]{.underline}. It [follows as well
that although a function\'s output may be]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}** [based on]{.underline} the [conditions in
which it was applied, those output are]{.underline} **[functionally
related]{.underline}**. So, to say, 'if Black then Black-ness given a
Black identity' follows but only for a singular context. If Black=0,
then that statement is incoherent for there is no explanation available
within that domain for how that identity was constructed if 0=abject.
Black identity in this case becomes ahistorical. However, as the zero of
a function for us represents the function itself before its application,
we find, 'if Black-ness then Black given Black-ness' posits the means of
constituting what this Black identity is by way of the function, its
mode, of its expression. That function indicates a domain in which it
applies. Therefore, [Blackness can appear in]{.underline} **[multiple
ways]{.underline}** and yet remain, as James Baldwin once put it, 'very
Black' albeit under different 'names'. [Identity]{.underline}
**[within]{.underline}** [frame is secondary to that which
projects]{.underline}, animates, [that identity, for names
are]{.underline} **[context dependent]{.underline}**. Names are
expressed as a function of position in frame (Fara, 2015). If
Black-ness=0, all we have done is instantiate the function by which a
Black identity is expressed within the line of contexts in which that
identity holds.

[If [pessimism]{.mark} is concerned with]{.underline} instantiation,
i.e., [enumerating]{.underline} the [instances in which]{.underline}
that [subject appears and]{.underline}
**[[negating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [them [all]{.mark}, then when this
line of]{.underline} **['Black' instantiations]{.underline}** [is
considered ordinally, [each]{.mark} instance
[contains]{.mark}]{.underline} its [**[priors]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thereby [[cites]{.mark} its]{.underline}
**[[means of construction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Turing, 1938). As
such, [Blackness by]{.underline} way of [a]{.underline} **[functional
consideration]{.underline}** [of subjectivity]{.underline} (=subject +
activity), as a non-member member of every articulated instance or
group, [is no longer an issue for it is the]{.underline}
**[supernumerary]{.underline}**. The supernumerary, then, is not empty.
It is [how we get from]{.underline} **[zero to one]{.underline}**. As
[zero can be]{.underline} **[formalised]{.underline}** [as an object of
thought, for it represents the function whose operation
expresses]{.underline} the [concepts within the frameworks to which it
is indexed, [Blackness]{.mark} is]{.underline}
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** empty nor [**[socially
dead]{.underline}** [but understood by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[its]{.underline} **[[functional-content]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is
to say that [it is expressed by an operation]{.underline}, **[not
indexed]{.underline}** [to a thing but a]{.underline} **[form of
life]{.underline}**. A function is expressed by an operation across
domains of appropriate application in which the zero of that line is
contained and is represented by way of a logic of reference (=chains of
citation) considered ordinally. It follows that [Blackness, expressed as
a]{.underline} **[function of operations]{.underline}** [across
contexts, is expressed by]{.underline} its forms of
**[life]{.underline}**, [not]{.underline} some and [only]{.underline}
one thing positing [its own demise]{.underline}. [If the same function
is introduced to a]{.underline} **[different context]{.underline}**,
[its output may be]{.underline} **[different]{.underline}** and yet
[related to others by that functional-content]{.underline}. The policy
of [negating]{.underline} **[one\'s own mode of
expression]{.underline}** [is the issue, not the]{.underline}
**[object]{.underline}** [articulated]{.underline}.

Blackness need not play the role pessimism has determined for it. Thus,
[if to be]{.underline}(come) [Black is to]{.underline} **[always
already]{.underline}** [be a slave]{.underline}, (Wilderson, 2020) [then
on its own terms pessimism]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}** [get
off of the ground]{.underline}, like [a move having to reference
the]{.underline} **[overall strategy]{.underline}** [of which it is a
component]{.underline}. Therefore, [the [pessimist frame]{.mark} is a
matter of]{.underline} **[policy]{.underline}** [not of]{.underline}
**[concept]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[history]{.underline}**. An
[attempt [to abstract an]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[instance]{.mark} from
history]{.underline}** [[and place it]{.underline} **[in the
future]{.underline}**]{.mark} so [as [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[predetermine]{.underline}**]{.mark} the [[value]{.mark} of an
operation today [misses]{.mark} the mark for [the function
of]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[predetermination]{.underline}]{.mark},
for any instance, [must be equivalent to the function of that
instance]{.underline} **[identical to itself]{.underline}**, [in
addition to the]{.underline} **[next]{.underline}** [one]{.underline}.
This [diagonalisation [proves]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[**[unprovability]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the function
of [that]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[universal
determination]{.underline}**]{.mark}. (see Baek (2017) on 'Culture,
Computation, and Morality') Therefore, by that models own definitions, a
predetermination of [the scope of [subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[prior]{.underline}** [to its articulation [will]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[remain incomplete]{.underline}**]{.mark}. But [this is]{.underline}
exactly **[what]{.underline}** [subjectivity is]{.underline}. We might
as well cross over pessimism, taking what\'s been opened up by that
endeavour as motive to go on, for we must be careful the extent to which
we onboard the means of our own subordination.

[Against Left Melancholy]{.underline}

In a widely read 1999 essay, political theorist [Wendy [Brown regrets
\"the Left\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}. . . [[failure
to]{.underline}]{.mark} apprehend the character of the age and to
[[develop]{.mark} a political critique and a moral-[political
vision]{.mark} appropriate to this character]{.underline}.\"84 [She
ascribes this failure to an attitude of \"Left melancholy\" in which
\"[the **revolutionary hack**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}. . .
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, finally, **[[attached more to]{.mark} a
particular [political analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}or
ideal---[even to the failure of that ideal]{.underline}---**[[than to
seizing possibilities for radical change]{.mark} in the
present]{.underline}**.\"\" [[This]{.mark}
\"**[narcissism]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}with regard to one\'s
past political attachments . . . [[exceeds]{.mark} any contemporary
[investment in **political mobilization**]{.mark}]{.underline},
alliance, or transformation.\"\" Her conception of \"Left melancholy\"
builds on the insights of Walter Benjamin concerning the German 192os
and Stuart Hall concerning the British 197os. Both thinkers criticized
the traditional Left for failing, in moments of historical crisis, to
fulfill its self-appointed role as the leader of a mass movement for
societal transformation. In each case, Brown suggests, [[a rigid
attachment]{.mark} to outmoded ideals [prevented]{.mark} Left actors
[from]{.mark} recognizing new conditions and
**[responding]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}adequately **[[to]{.mark}
new [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [She relates this]{.underline}
blindness and paralysis [to the overwhelming sense of **loss** following
**great political defeats**]{.underline}.

Brown sought to warn her 1999 interlocutors against the dangers of
political melancholy at a moment when the global Left was suffering
another round of historic losses. She was especially concerned about the
tendency among traditional Leftists to scapegoat identity politics for
these losses, even as they remained anachronistically attached to a
reductive materialism and belief in historical teleology. [[The result
was an impoverished \"Left]{.mark} traditionalism\" [that operates
**without**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}either a deep and radical
critique of the status quo or a **[compelling [alternative]{.mark} to
the existing order of things]{.underline}** . . . [a Left that has
become **[more attached to]{.mark} its [impossibility than]{.mark} to
its potential [fruitfulness]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}. . . [a
Left that is thus caught in a structure of **melancholic
attachment**]{.underline} to a certain strain of its own dead past.\"\'
In contrast, she calls for \"the Left to invigorate \[itself\] with a
radical . . . critical and visionary spirit . . . that embraces the
notion of deep and indeed unsettling transformation of society.\" [She
asks, in terms that should still reverberate today, \"How might we draw
creative sustenance]{.underline} from socialist ideals of dignity,
equality, and freedom, [while recognizing that these ideals were
conjured from historical conditions and prospects that are not those of
the present?\"]{.underline}\' [Here then is a response to]{.underline}
Traverso\'s [dilemma]{.underline} that **[rejects]{.underline}** rather
than revives **[melancholic attachments to]{.underline}** past
**[defeats]{.underline}** and convictions.

demise of social justice in Revisiting Richard Rorty. Vernon Press,
2020.

But [what]{.underline} exactly [is wrong with]{.underline} wanting to
have, or thinking we already possess, [a]{.underline} "source of
[[theoretically based prognostication]{.underline}]{.mark}"?
[Why]{.underline} does Rorty consistently [disparage
'prophecy']{.underline} so understood? At least part of the problem, if
not the whole problem, has to do with the outsized nature of whatever we
normally take this source to be. [This]{.underline} thing [[is]{.mark}
always [so large]{.mark} and world- historical [that all]{.mark}
our]{.underline} fallible [human strivings and **[piecemeal achievements
in]{.mark} the direction of increased [social justice pale]{.mark} in
comparison**]{.underline} to it, [[and]{.mark} in fact **[wither]{.mark}
under its glare**]{.underline}. With Martin Jay, Rorty insists that [[we
refuse]{.mark} to be haunted by the need to measure whatever [modest
successes]{.mark} we achieve in this direction
[against]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}"the daunting model of **[a
normatively [totalized]{.mark}]{.underline}**, fully redeemed, [social
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}."13 He continues:

"Part of the reason the next century looks so blank and formless to us
is that we [intellectuals have grown accustomed to thinking in
**[world-historical]{.mark}, eschatological
[terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We have [become impatient
with]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}anything [smaller]{.underline},
discontented with **[[patchwork solutions]{.mark} and temporary
stopgaps]{.underline}**."14 In this way, says Rorty, we
[[intellectuals]{.mark} have tended to [neglect]{.mark} and]{.underline}
have [failed to cherish]{.underline} any particular, **[[local solutions
to]{.mark} social [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}that cannot
also be applied universally. [In so doing, **we [lose the trees for the
forest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so to speak, **[[and
then]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course, **[we [lose the forest as
well]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Rorty wants us to [[replace]{.mark} such **[large]{.mark},
world-historical [theories]{.mark}**]{.underline}, along with their
prophecies and prognostications, **[[with]{.mark} smaller, more [local
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and achievements. He wants
us to [[take]{.underline}]{.mark} up [[**responsibility** for]{.mark}
pursuing the **million [tiny steps]{.mark}** []{.mark}that intervene
between the world's current damaged condition and the dream of a
completely redeemed social order. Instead of fixating on the
latter]{.underline}, he wants us to [[ask]{.mark} questions about
**[what]{.mark} exactly [we would do if we]{.mark} suddenly
[achieved]{.mark} real political [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
[what]{.underline} sort of utopia [would we]{.underline} try to
[create]{.underline}, and [**[how would we set about doing
so?]{.underline}**]{.mark} In reply to these questions, Rorty hopes we
can simply admit that "[at the moment, we have no idea]{.underline} what
a redeemed social order would look like \... we can sketch no ground
plan for the egalitarian cooperative commonwealth whose spires we
glimpse in our dreams." Yet even without such a ground plan---without a
world-historical theory that gives us the power to make sure
prognostications---[we can]{.underline}, Rorty says, "[[offer]{.mark}
a]{.underline} long **[list of [laws]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
international agreements, border rectifications, [judicial decisions,
and the like **that [we would]{.mark} try to have
[promulgate]{.mark}d**]{.underline}."15 Rorty simply wants us to [get to
work on **that list**]{.underline}.

Do-It-Yourself Politics

In Québec, as elsewhere, forms of political commitment have profoundly
evolved: from mass involvement within large protest organizations
(labour unions, political parties, militant NGOs) aiming at general
social transformations, [[political commitment has]{.underline}]{.mark}
largely [[been **individualized**]{.mark} to the benefit of an \"**à la
carte**\" involvement [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[form of **boutique
activism**. It]{.underline}]{.mark} is more punctual and very often
[[focuses on **specific problems** that manifest themselves in
a]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[**local** and **restricted way**]{.mark}.
We get involved in more or less **ephemeral causes** with]{.underline}
friends or [our **immediate entourage**, and [we **abandon organized
activism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This is]{.underline} what political scientists at the University of
Montréal have (among others) [[called **DIY Politics**]{.mark},
collective action aimed at creating its **own political
universe**]{.underline}24. [DIY Politics manifests itself]{.underline}
in two ways: either [through]{.underline} the [[will to bypass the
**market** and **institutional actors** to do things one\'s own
way]{.underline}]{.mark} (a solidarity café, a neighborhood geothermal
project, a local purchasing cooperative)25, [or by seeking to take
things into one\'s own hands, [convinced]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
political elites and [**[institutions]{.mark} in place** [are incapable
of bringing about]{.mark}]{.underline} the social
[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark} we want to see. We then work to build, at
our level, a world that is more like us or to oppose projects that we
consider incompatible with our values26.

I have experienced first-hand this orientation towards local and
targeted activism as it is the DNA of Équiterre, one of Canada's largest
environmental NGOs, where I worked for almost a decade. A large part of
Équiterre\'s action was then - and still is - aimed at encouraging the
multiplication of individual and collective actions to \"change the
world one step at a time\" in the fields of agriculture, energy
consumption, transportation and fair trade27. Under the impulse of its
initiators, notably ecosociologist Laure Waridel, Équiterre was part of
a strong social movement seeking to reinvent our consumption practices,
on the margins of market capitalism, through a host of initiatives in
the form of organic, bulk or zero-waste grocery stores, cooperatives
that share tools and means of transportation, and even community energy
production.

These initiatives, whether consciously or not, are largely inspired by
thinkers of social ecology and ecocommunitarianism who, like Murray
Bookchin, advocate the development of decentralized grassroots
communities28. The whole movement of Cities and Villages in Transition29
is thus inspired and permeated by Bookchin\'s thinking: citizen groups
sharing the same social and environmental aspirations, transformative
actions at the local level, values of collaboration and mutual aid and,
above all, self-organization on the basis of direct democracy30.
[Insofar as they place themselves **outside the official structures** of
the **State** and withdraw from its **control**, in favour
of]{.underline} the **[decentralization]{.underline}** of political and
economic decisions, [the initiatives stemming from]{.underline} a
[vision of social economy and eco-communitarianism are directly inspired
by **anarchist thought**]{.underline}31.

I have also had a front row seat to the second form of DIY politics,
namely the rejection by a whole section of the environmental movement of
established political and social organizations as vehicles for change,
and a firm opposition to major hydrocarbon infrastructure projects. This
was first manifested a few years ago with the surprise and seemingly
spontaneous creation of dozens of local citizen groups against shale gas
development in the St. Lawrence Valley

For the initiators of these groups (most of them women), the way to
block drilling projects was not through big organizations like
Équiterre, the David Suzuki Foundation and Greenpeace, nor through
political parties. It was about taking matters into their own hands and
fighting the developers on the ground through dozens local actions.

In retrospect, the strategic vision of these groups was the right one.
Without this locally galvanized activist energy, the St. Lawrence Valley
would have been covered with hundreds of wells and flaring units. In my
opinion, our large professionalized environmental groups would not have
known how -- let alone been able to - oppose these drilling projects
successfully32.

The same scenario repeated itself during the mobilization against the
Energy East pipeline, which would have transported huge quantities of
bituminous oil from Alberta to the east coast of Canada. Dozens of
citizens\' groups have again formed along its proposed route to prevent
its passage.

This time, several large environmental groups such as Équiterre,
Greenpeace and the Association québécoise de lutte contre la pollution
atmosphérique (AQLPA) offered their support and collaboration, very
aware that a victory against Energy East would require a very clear
demonstration of the lack of social acceptability on the part of the
population directly concerned. In this case, therefore, traditional
hierarchical relationships between large national groups and local
activist cells were completely reversed: instead of setting themselves
up as leaders of the mobilization against Energy East, large
environmental groups - while leading the battle at their level, in the
traditional media, with their members, public authorities and decision
makers -- offered to help and support activists mobilized on the ground.

In the end, this strategic vision and division of labour also triumphed,
as Energy East was eventually cancelled by its proponents (and
ultimately rejected by the government of Québec). This model of DIY
Politics, used to block projects and initiatives on the ground, often
yields very good results.

\*\*\*

But [[**blocking projects** and]{.mark} initiating
**[micro-interventions]{.mark}** on the ground [is **not enough to fight
climate change**. What is]{.mark}]{.underline} ultimately [[**needed**
is to change **society as a whole**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[exceptional force of **imagination**]{.mark}, as well
as]{.underline} the [deployment of]{.underline} energy and [innovation
of this eco-anarchist movement, [are]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[**integral part** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the radical
[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [necessary today]{.underline}.
This movement has its role to play in the social changes we need.

On the other hand, and this is one of my main contentions here, [the
[rejection of **large collective institutions**]{.mark} by this
eco-anarchist current, a rejection]{.underline} that is [[accompanied
by]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[disinterest]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if not
outright hostility, [[towards]{.mark} **social [debate]{.mark}** and
**representative democracy**[, hinders]{.mark} the [adoption of radical
ideas and solutions on a **large scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[By remaining **local**]{.underline}]{.mark} and isolated, [radical
[initiatives are unable to present solutions]{.mark} that could spread
more widely. By **[shunning democratic institutions]{.mark}** and the
**ballot box**, their [promoters **weaken**]{.mark} their [influence on
**collective decisions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Worse, [they [leave the
field open to **more conservative**]{.mark} - or outright
**reactionary** - [segments]{.mark} of society, which]{.underline} then
[have a disproportionate influence on]{.underline} public
[decisions]{.underline}.

The [anarchist]{.underline} and poststructuralist [turn
explains]{.underline} in large part [why today\'s radical politics is
**not yet able to provide global solutions** to]{.underline} our
**[environmental crisis]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, anarchist and
poststructuralist radicalism, with its focus on localized ideas and
experiments, is a hotbed of innovations that could be scaled up and
generalized, and perhaps give us the new tools needed to address the
environmental and climate crisis.

The question is how.

### AT: Extractivism

#### Successfully challenging extractivism requires a [political]{.underline} strategy that can overcome financial and social [obstacles.]{.underline} 

**Riofrancos 21** \[Thea Riofrancos -- professor @ Providence College.
The Dilemmas of Extractivism, DOSSIER: SOCIOENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION,

of my book Resource Radicals: From Petro-Nationalism to
Post-Extractivism in Ecuador (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2020).
Latin American Studies Association -- Forum 52:4, Fall 2021, JKS\]

[The framework of extractivism combines a longue durée
timescale]{.underline} (from conquest to the present) [with attention to
the expansionary territorial dynamic of extraction.]{.underline} For
example, the transportation infrastructure that accompanies extractive
projects triggers a domino effect of territorial reorganization, as new
roads attract human settlement, expand the agricultural frontier, and
lead to further deforestation. [From the perspective of extractivism as
critique, the ideological spillover effects are even more
pervasive]{.underline}. Extractivism becomes hegemonic common sense,
what Maristella Svampa refers to as "the commodities consensus," which
structures the parameters of politics and affectively binds subjects to
the logic of extractive capital (Svampa 2015, 50).

[Given this depiction of extractivism as an ideologically closed and
constantly expanding system, short of an exogenous shock the possibility
of transformation would appear foreclosed.]{.underline} [Whence the
problem of envisioning how a post-extractive society could be built out
of an extractive society.]{.underline} Relatedly, [**[there are the
challenges of anti-extractivism as political strategy]{.underline}**.
[Who is the imagined collective subject leading
this]{.underline}]{.mark} [transformative [process?]{.mark} How is this
subject composed, **and [by what means could it dismantle extractivism
and assemble a new social form?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[A [post-extractive transition would have to wind down]{.mark}
extractive [projects, secure alternative sources of state revenue, and
remediate social and environmental harm.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Such an
effort [would face the **immediate obstacle** of capital's disciplinary
power: revoking]{.mark} concessions or [contracts]{.mark} inevitably
[provokes foreign firms]{.mark} to appeal to investor arbitration
tribunals. This hurdle aside, there is the question of the temporality
of such a transition. [While]{.mark} anti-extractive [activists demanded
an immediate cessation of oil and mining projects, allied intellectuals
have proposed a "planned decrease" that would phase out extraction while
still channeling]{.mark} extractive [rents to]{.mark} [address social
needs until new]{.mark} economic [sectors are
developed]{.mark}]{.underline} and taxation capacity is consolidated
(Acosta). Ultimately, [such a transition cannot unfold on the national
scale alone: [regional coordination would be necessary to reorient
production and consumption toward satisfying human needs while
maintaining ecological balance]{.mark} and to avoid the
race-to-the-bottom dynamic that undermines domestic regulatory
capacities.]{.underline}

#### Renewable energy is an important site for the struggle for Indigenous sovereignty and only political engagement can solve 

**Grosse and Mark '23** (Corrie, College of Saint Benedict and Saint
John\'s University, Brigid, University of Colorado Boulder, "Does
renewable electricity promote Indigenous sovereignty? Reviewing support,
barriers, and recommendations for solar and wind energy development on
Native lands in the United States", Energy Research & Social Science
Volume 104, October 2023,
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629623003031,
\[SG\])

Studies in the energy field often ask how to overcome resistance or
obstacles to renewable energy \[e.g. \[53\]\]; renewable energy is the
goal. In contrast, [**[research and projects that]{.mark} most [benefit
Native communities]{.mark}** ask how to **[achieve sovereignty]{.mark},
[employing renewable energy as a tool]{.mark}**; sovereignty is the
goal.]{.underline} Sovereignty has different components \[see \[54\]\].
[[Political sovereignty]{.mark} defines the status of Native nations as
holding nation-like power with the right to
self-determination]{.underline}, [and [control over governance and
land]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the US, political sovereignty for Native
nations is "based on federal 'trust' or 'domestic dependency' relations
between tribes and the US federal government," placing "federal agencies
in the position of 'neutral' arbiter of what is ultimately best for
tribes, perhaps after a period of more or less meaningful consultation"
\[\[55\], p. 806\]. This dependent relationship leads dominant white
settler values to shape decisions that affect Native nations \[55\].
Dependency is in stark contrast to the self-sufficiency and
self-reliance prioritized by tribal governments \[55\]. [[Cultural
sovereignty]{.mark} comes from within Native nations]{.underline}
\[\[56\], p. 197\]. [It is about tribes "envision\[ing\] how the
[combination of]{.mark} full political [autonomy]{.mark}, evocation of
[tradition]{.mark} as processes, [and reclamation of history and
cultural identity]{.mark} would form their own unique definition of
sovereignty"]{.underline} \[\[57\], p. 119\]. [Cultural sovereignty
supports tribes "to assert their ideas about appropriate technologies,
economic development, and political process,]{.underline} just as much
as they should be able [to advocate for [protecting ceremonial
spaces]{.mark} [or promoting]{.mark} traditional
[arts]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[\[55\], p. 807\]. This
[**[sovereignty]{.mark}** can be **[enacted]{.mark} "[in]{.mark}** very
**[practical terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in [[decisions that affect
how tribal people live]{.underline}]{.mark}"; "[how to [nurture]{.mark}
children [and]{.mark} elders, how to [live with the nonhuman
world]{.mark}, and, certainly, how [to]{.mark} build shelter are all
areas in which culturally based values can have a direct and tangible
impact on tribal people's lives]{.underline}" \[\[55\], p. 807\]. As we
demonstrate below, [factors that support or limit sovereignty have a
direct impact on renewable energy development]{.underline} and renewable
energy development has potential to support or limit sovereignty.
**[[Settler colonialism is an ongoing "structure not an
event]{.mark}"]{.underline}** \[\[58\], p. 2\], **[[upheld by
institutions, policies, and laws]{.underline}]{.mark}**---many centuries
old---[that continue to shape renewable energy development on Native
lands]{.underline}. The very notion of seeing nature and non-human
relatives as "resources" is foundational for colonialism \[36\]. In
1823, the Doctrine of Discovery as applied by the courts established
that though tribes could occupy the land, the "discoverer"---the
US---was the exclusive owner of the property, with the right to
terminate Native occupancy at any time \[\[59\], p. 815\]. In 1887, the
Dawes General Allotment Act sought to dismantle common ownership of land
in reservations, carving reservations into parcels of 160 acres that
were allocated to Native individuals as a condition of US citizenship
\[60\]. Any land remaining was declared "surplus," then given to
settlers. Unable to pay taxes, many Native landowners lost their land,
further consolidating settler farms and fragmenting reservations. [From
1887 to 1934, non-Natives appropriated ninety million acres of land from
Native peoples]{.underline} \[60\]. [After the Dawes Act, federal policy
aimed at termination of reservations and forced assimilation,
diminishing sovereignty]{.underline}. Beginning in 1970, the Nixon
administration began the "self-determination era" of federal Indian
policy \[59,61\]. The 1975 Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act authorized tribes to participate in the provision of
their own essential services. The key government agencies created to
regulate Native land include the Department of Interior (DOI) (1849),
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) (1824), and the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) (1946). The DOI ensures trust responsibilities to Native Nations,
the BIA manages surface and subsurface minerals estates held in trust by
the US for Native nations, and the BLM regulates resource extraction on
DOI lands. Many of today's energy agencies were created in the 1970s. In
1977, the Department of Energy Organization Act created the Department
of Energy (DOE) and two sub-agencies: the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) which manages energy data and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) which regulates interstate energy sales and
sets wholesale energy rates \[62\]. The 1982 Indian Mineral Development
Act (IMDA) allows for agreements (e.g. leases and joint ownership
arrangements) for fossil fuel development through a process where tribes
negotiate with non-tribal entities and then must gain approval from the
Secretary of the Interior (hereafter Secretary) \[63\]. [[Few tribes
have]{.mark} the [capital to develop energy on their own, necessitating
partnerships]{.mark} and leases with non-tribal entities and Secretarial
approval.]{.underline} There was no similar law for renewable energy
until the 2005 Energy Policy Act \[63\]. [The 2005 Energy Policy Act
established two offices to carry out its provisions on Native lands: the
Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs under the DOE]{.underline}
\[64\] [and the Division of Indian Energy Policy Development within the
Indian Energy and Economic Development Office of the DOI. It also
created the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination
Act]{.underline} (ITEDSDA), [hailed early on as the "most significant
federal law relating to renewable energy on tribal lands]{.underline}"
\[\[65\], p. 104\]. [[The]{.mark} goal of [ITEDSDA]{.mark} was to [speed
up renewable]{.mark} energy [agreements]{.mark} by [giving more control
to tribes]{.mark}]{.underline} \[65\]. Under ITEDSDA, [tribes can enter
into tribal energy resource agreements ([TERAs]{.mark}) with the
Secretary. After obtaining a TERA, renewable energy projects do not
require Secretarial approval, [allowin]{.mark}g more [direct
communication]{.mark} [between tribes and investors]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[62\]. To acquire a TERA, tribes must consult with the DOI, go through
a public comment and potentially a National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) review, a tribal environmental review that must be open to public
comment, and then periodic Secretarial performance reviews \[46\]. If a
TERA is granted, the Secretary of Interior is absolved from liabilities.
As we describe in the barriers and recommendations section, TERAs are
difficult to obtain and so have not been utilized by tribes. [Due to the
difficulties of the TERA process, most renewable energy on Native lands
uses DOI approved leases under the Indian Long-Term Leasing Act or the
Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Homeownership Act
(HEARTH) amendments to that act,]{.underline} [which allow for leasing,
but not for authority over projects or right of ways]{.underline}
\[61\]. HEARTH allows tribes to lease land without approval from the
Secretary of Interior, if the leasing occurs under Secretary approved
provisions. As of 2015, HEARTH had been used by 20 tribes for renewable
projects \[61\]. The 2018 Amendments to ITEDSDA allow organizations with
majority tribal ownership called Tribal Energy Development Organizations
(TEDOs) to enter contracts with tribes without Secretarial approval,
advancing self-determination and making tribes more accountable to
tribal members over land use decisions \[47,61\]. In March 2022, the Red
Lake Nation won federal approval to create the first TEDO \[66\]. A
final policy of importance in renewable energy development is the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) \[see \[66\]\]. This act
requires that federal agencies consult with tribes about impacts to
sacred sites that tribes have enlisted in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). **[Several [policies have]{.mark} [created
financial incentives, grants, and loans for Native renewable]{.mark}
energy [projects.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As we describe below, Native
nations' ability to access these incentives is a major barrier to
Native-led renewables. The 1992 Energy Policy Act authorized the DOE to
provide grants and loans for Native renewable energy that were furthered
by the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The 2022 Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA) increased the loan authority from \$2 billion to
\$20 billion \[\[68\], p. 5\]. **[Three renewable [incentives that
tribes can]{.mark} [leverage]{.mark} are [Renewable Portfolio Standards
(RPS]{.mark})]{.underline}** \[13,59,61,69\], [**[net metering]{.mark},
and [feed-in tariffs]{.mark}**. The 2005 Energy Policy Act also provided
federal preference to purchase energy and electricity from Native
nations]{.underline}. The purchasing preference has not been used,
something the Biden Administration plans to change \[70\]. [Renewable
energy [investment]{.mark} [and]{.mark} production [tax
credits]{.mark}]{.underline}, created by the 2005 Energy Policy Act but
not made accessible to Native nations until the IRA \[68\], will
[[provide]{.mark} [important financial support]{.mark}]{.underline} (we
discuss these in depth in Section 3.4.3.2). [Other options for renewable
development include intertribal and tribally owned
organizations.]{.underline} The Intertribal Council on Utility Policy
(Intertribal COUP) was founded in 1994 to organize Great Plains tribes
to develop wind energy and provide input on energy regulations. Section
17 Corporations are exempt from state taxation and allow tribes to enter
into contracts without BIA approval, though Bureau approval is still
required for leases most common for energy development; [simple [legal
amendments]{.mark} to Section 17 Corporations could [enable
greater]{.mark} tribal [ownership]{.mark} over renewable
projects]{.underline} \[61\]. [Tribal Utilities [allow tribes to own and
finance projects]{.mark} through [distributing costs]{.mark} of
generation to ratepayers [over time]{.mark}]{.underline} \[see Navajo
case in \[61\]\]. Like TEDOs, [Tribal Utilities are mechanisms that can
increase tribal sovereignty over renewable energy.]{.underline} Unlike
TEDOs, Tribal Utilities have been used for decades; 15 tribally owned
electric utilities own distribution and 13 do not own distribution
\[14\].

Researchers find that [**[Indigenous leadership and ownership of

possible roles for tribal governments]{.underline}" \[\[48\], p. 2\].
[As of 2022, only four Native nations had installed utility-level solar
projects]{.underline} \[49\].

This paper provides a systematic literature review of 74 articles on
Native peoples\' involvement in solar and wind electricity, hereafter
renewable energy, in the United States. We use the term "Native" to
refer to people Indigenous to the US, who may not identify as
Americans.3 Indigenous nations are diverse in culture, practices, and
energy preferences \[37,39,50,51\]. However, [shared (not identical)
experiences of settler colonialism in the US mean Native nations face
common challenges and opportunities for **[realizing sovereignty and
self-determination]{.mark}** and in **[using renewable energy]{.mark} to
achieve these goals**.]{.underline}

A [synthesis of existing Native-led renewable energy research is
important for scholars]{.underline} interested in this area to be able
[to identify how to build upon this body of literature]{.underline}.
Legal journals on this topic typically have a narrow focus on a specific
policy and there is little existing social science literature on this
topic. This review brings legal journals and social science literature
into conversation so that they may inform each other and lay a pathway
for future research.

Offering an outline of barriers and benefits to Native-led renewable
energy in the US, as well as a synthesis of the legal context, this
paper builds [the foundation for future research]{.underline}, which
[becomes even more important because of the recent passage of the
Inflation Reduction Act and increasing scholarly attention to issues of
energy justice]{.underline}. Our review complements existing research
based in Canada (whose legal and political context is distinct from the
US), which composes the bulk of previous research and review articles
and emphasizes potential benefits of renewable energy alongside caution,
calling for additional research \[23\].

Below, we first describe the methodology of our study. We then present
our analysis, which includes insights from the literature, organized by
theme, and the implications of these insights for [**[advancing
Native-owned and]{.mark} Native-[led renewable energy]{.mark}** on
Native lands, an important step toward sovereignty]{.underline}. Our
review finds that existing literature focuses on support for and
barriers to Native involvement, Native leadership, and Native ownership
in renewable energy development.

[There are many aspects of Native nations and [wind and solar
electricity that support renewable]{.mark} energy [development]{.mark}
as a way to advance sovereignty]{.underline}. [[While there]{.mark} are
also]{.underline} many [[barriers,]{.mark}]{.underline} existing
recommendations and recent [**[policies offer ways of overcoming
these]{.mark}**, to the benefit of Native and non-Native people
alike.]{.underline}

[In the wake of Russia's expanded war of aggression against Ukraine,
Russia's northern Indigenous communities have experienced a
disproportionate degree of hardship.]{.underline} Given their small
sizes, remoteness, and ethnicities, these [communities]{.underline}
[have been]{.underline} particularly [targeted by Russian mobilization
efforts. This builds on decades of Russian state abuse, surrounding land
use and resource development that has ignored local concerns and damaged
traditional Indigenous territories. Arctic Indigenous
leadership]{.underline}, in the form of the Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON) [has been coopted by the
Kremlin and is now little more than a mouthpiece for government
directives.]{.underline} Consequently, [many Indigenous leaders have
fled Russia]{.underline} -- but these political exiles retain important
networks inside Russia, where locals continue to resist state
oppression. Nevertheless, [while Russia has long paid lip service to
Indigenous rights, the state's growing totalitarian tendencies and
confrontation with the West has led to near total state control over
regional representative organizations.]{.underline}

This NAADSN Policy Primer begins with a background overview of RAIPON
and its transformation into a state-controlled organ in the early 2010s
before analyzing its statements supporting Russia's war of aggression
against Ukraine. Our analysis discerns that it has promoted three key
narratives since February 2022: that RAIPON is a staunch supporter of
the Kremlin and of President Vladimir Putin personally; that RAIPON is a
strategic link between Russia and the so-called "newly acquired
territories" (Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhian oblasts); and
that RAIPON is the only legitimate representative of Russia's Arctic and
Siberian Indigenous population. We then provide a short assessment of
how [the War in Ukraine has affected Russia's Indigenous peoples,
despite Russian narratives claiming widespread Indigenous support for
the war effort.]{.underline} The last section identifies voices of
dissent associated with the International Committee of Indigenous
Peoples of Russia (ICIPR) and the "Indigenous Russia" (iRussia)
information center. Our conclusions reflect on how political divisions
amongst the Arctic states, dramatically exacerbated by the War in the
Ukraine, are also reflected amongst and within the Permanent
Participants to the Arctic Council.

#### Indigenous people foot the cost of Russian warfare -- preventing escalation is key to halting further discrimination and violence.

In February 2023, [Pavel Sulyandziga highlighted the disproportionate
number of Russian Indigenous people who have been conscripted to fight
in the War in Ukraine. On the Russian side, the number of Indigenous
combatants in the war is proportionally higher than the number of ethnic
Russians combatants. With mobilization criteria paying no respect to
Indigeneity and the roles of men within those societies, recruitment has
had deleterious effects on the cultures and traditions of Indigenous
peoples in Russia.]{.underline}41 Furthermore, [data sets]{.underline}
(collected by a team of volunteers from the social media and other
available sources) [demonstrate large inequalities in the army mortality
rates across Russian regions]{.underline}, with the highest mortality of
soldiers originating from poor regions in Siberia and the Russian Far
East and the lowest from Moscow and St. Petersburg.42 In short, [the
share of Indigenous peoples in the total number of deaths in the war
appears to be disproportionately high, based on official Russian
statistics and numbers provided by Russian scientists.]{.underline}
Consequently, [it is reasonable to conclude that the war in Ukraine has
rendered Russia's Indigenous peoples more vulnerable and has imposed a
disproportionate burden and cost on them.]{.underline} This story is not
well known in Russia owing to censorship.

A 2022 article by Umea University (Sweden) doctoral student Ekaterina
Zmyvalova provides a helpful summary of how the war in Ukraine
negatively affects the human rights of Indigenous small-numbered peoples
of Russia. These include the right to freedom of expression, the right
to enjoy their culture, and the right to life, liberty and security.
Specific impacts include:

> • Russia's growing disregard for its international legal obligations;
>
> • [the introduction of new sanctions against persons and organizations
> who do not support the Russian regime's official discourses about the
> war, and increased pressure on Indigenous peoples' representatives to
> strictly adhere to state messaging or face intimidation]{.underline}
> (like the Tannagasheva case noted in the previous section) [and severe
> legal consequences]{.underline};
>
> • [the active participation of Indigenous small-numbered peoples in
> the war due to socio- economic challenges facing their
> communities]{.underline} (including a lack of wage-earning
> opportunities compared to other Russian populations) [and the absence
> of reliable and objective information about the war in
> Ukraine]{.underline};
>
> • [a decline in international cooperation with the Indigenous
> small-numbered peoples of Russia]{.underline} (as it is hard for
> international organizations to trust Russian-based Indigenous people's
> organizations because of their adherence to the Kremlin's narratives
> about the war); and
>
> • [increasing constraints on Russian Indigenous peoples in
> participating in international decision-making, including the Arctic
> Council]{.underline} (given the decision by the seven like- minded
> Arctic states to suspend participation in Council activities involving
> Russia).43

In a short update released in January 2023, Zmyvalova notes that, [on
the Russian side, the number of Indigenous combatants in the war is
proportionally higher than the number of ethnic Russians
combatants.]{.underline} "[The Indigenous population is more vulnerable
and on average of lower socio- economic status than ethnic
Russians]{.underline}," she notes, "hence participation in the war is
financially more attractive for them." Furthermore, activists note that
mobilizing persons from areas "far from Moscow and St. Petersburg is a
way for the Kremlin to reduce the draft's impact on major cities, where
the chances of opposition protests are higher." Most Russian Indigenous
populations reside in small settlements or villages, some of which have
seen most of the male population mobilized. With mobilization criteria
paying no respect to Indigeneity and the roles of men within those
societies, [recruitment has had deleterious effects on the cultures and
traditions of Indigenous peoples in Russia.]{.underline}44

[Alexey Bessudnov]{.underline}, a sociology professor at the University
of Exeter, [released a paper]{.underline} in December 2022 [showing
ethnic and regional inequalities in mortality in the Russian army during
the 2022 war in Ukraine.]{.underline} Based on a data set (collected by
a team of volunteers from the social media and other available sources)
containing the names of about 9,500 Russian servicemen killed in Ukraine
from February to November 2022, [he demonstrates large inequalities in
the army mortality rates across Russian regions]{.underline}, with the
highest mortality of soldiers originating from poor regions in Siberia
and the Russian Far East and the lowest from Moscow and St. Petersburg.
[Some ethnic minority groups, in particular Buryats]{.underline} (a
Mongolic ethnic group native to southeastern Siberia) [and
Tuvans]{.underline} (a Turkic ethnic group Indigenous to Siberia ) [are
overrepresented among the fatalities compared to their share of the
Russian population.]{.underline} Bessudnov suggests that [ethnic
fatality gaps are largely driven by socio-economic
inequalities]{.underline}, with young men in poorer regions see the
career in the military as more attractive.45 In short, [statistic
evidence confirms that most Russian army recruits and conscripts come
from peripheral regions]{.underline} where unemployment, drug addiction
and criminality are rampant. Furthermore, [the share of Indigenous
peoples in the total number of deaths in the war appears to be
disproportionately high, based on official Russian statistics and
numbers provided by Russian scientists.]{.underline} Consequently, [it
is reasonable to conclude that the war in Ukraine has rendered Russia's
Indigenous peoples more vulnerable and has imposed a disproportionate
burden and cost on them.]{.underline} This story does not appear to be
well known or accepted in Russia.

**Opacity is the precondition for the entrapment of black life under the
subjugation of anti-black violence and genocide**

Tyrone S. **Palmer 17**, (Tyrone S. Palmer\'s teaching and research
concerns Black critical thought, poetics, and negativity), '"What Feels
More Than Feeling?": Theorizing the Unthinkability of Black Affect",
Critical Ethnic Studies, Vol 3, No. 2 (Fall 2017), pp. 31-56, University
of Minnesota Press, , 6/25/2024, AND?

[Theorists of Black performance]{.underline} [have mobilized
Glissant's]{.underline} [celebration of]{.underline} [opacity as an
essential]{.underline} [performative strategy of Black
"resistance]{.underline}."57 These theorists see the illegibility of
blackness as a strategically deployable [tool]{.underline} that allows
Blacks [to resist and escape]{.underline} [ostensibly
totalizing]{.underline} [systems of domination]{.underline}. Unknowable
and impenetrable modes of Black expression and movement, within this
framework, create spaces of relief and undermine colonial mandates of
legibility and transparency. [Yet,]{.underline} as Rankine's text
consistently
demonstrates, [Black]{.underline} [opacity]{.underline} [often]{.underline} [serves
as a prerequisite for violence and]{.underline} [functions
to]{.underline} [further entrap]{.underline} the Black [\[black bodies\]
in objecthood]{.underline}. While strategic opacity often serves a
crucial, invaluable function as a means of survival and psychic
self-protection,58 of getting by in a world that mandates your
destruction, often [what is made opaque---Black interiority, feelings,
desires---already]{.underline} [cannot be thought within the
onto-epistemological order of the Human-as-Man]{.underline}.

As Jared Sexton reminds us, "The intramural affairs of the Black
lifeworld . . . \[are\] invisible, inaudible, illegible---indeed
unthought---in the world, to the extent that Black life unfolds 'out of
the world' by definition." 59 So while, in theory, Black opacity could
function as a means of escape and resistance to the violence that
structures and pervades Black life, [in
actuality]{.underline} [Black]{.underline} [opacity
serves]{.underline} [as
a]{.underline} [(necessary)]{.underline} [precondition and justification
for the enactment of violence---both interpersonal and genocidal---upon
Black people.]{.underline} The refrain of "I didn't see you . . . I
really didn't see you,"60 which often follows the quotidian violence
throughout Citizen, is indicative of this. The
perceived [opacity]{.underline} [of
blackness]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [intimately]{.underline} [tied
to the unthinkability of Black suffering]{.underline}, in
particular, [and]{.underline} [Black]{.underline} [feeling]{.underline} [more
broadly]{.underline}. One poem demonstrates this particularly well: And
when the woman with the multiple degrees says, I didn't know Black women
could get cancer, instinctively you take two steps back though all
urgency leaves the possibility of any kind of relationship as you
realize nowhere is where you will get from here.

#### Geographic relationality is neither a meaningful ethical nor political program, and human individualist ontology isn't the cause of their impacts -- at best, vote NEG on presumption -- at worst, they actually do erase liberal institutions, but nothing fills in, only magnifies violent relations, locally and globally

Henry R. **Nau 22**, Professor Emeritus of Political Science and

*Uncertainty and Its Discontents: Worldviews in World Politics*, ed.
Peter J. Katzenstein, Cambridge University Press, 2022, ISBN
978-1-316-51266-1, p.179-200

This volume challenges us to stretch our imagination and rethink the
world of international relations. It engages modern substantialist,
Weberian approaches to social science with [new postmodern,
**relationalist** or **quantum** approaches]{.underline} and
**[conclude]{.underline}**s [that substantialist views which **emphasize
the individual** are **outdated**]{.underline}.1 [This conclusion is
**premature**. Stretching our imagination is one thing; tearing it up
is]{.underline} another. As we proceed, [we need a clear picture of what
we are stretching and potentially **tearing up**; it could be the
reasoning individual and the **human capacity to imagine
itself**]{.underline}.

[This chapter offers a **full-throated**]{.underline} (albeit limited)
exposition and [**defense** of the **Enlightenment**/Weberian worldview
that underlines **modern social science**]{.underline}. The
Enlightenment worldview gave form to the aspiration for individual
freedom and choice. It rescued humanity from the stultifying clutches of
mysticism (Nature) and religion (the Divine). It dethroned philosopher
kings and papal elites and empowered ordinary, individual human beings,
equipped with reason, spirit (emotion, faith), and education, to create,
assess, debate, and pass judgment on alternative worldviews. Natural
science exploded under Isaac Newton's vision of an orderly universe
fixed in time and space following predictable laws. And social science
spawned a virtual cornucopia of modern worldviews, both individualistic
and authoritarian. Liberalism (John Locke), capitalism (Adam Smith),
humanism (Max Weber), communism (Karl Marx), and fascism (Friedrick
Nietzsche), among others, competed (and fought) to organize and direct
social and scientific life.2 [In the West, through struggle, humanist
and capitalist worldviews prevailed, fueling material progress, the
spread of republican institutions, and gnawing anguish about minorities
left behind]{.underline}.

[Now, postmodern worldviews of [**relationalism** and]{.mark}
**hyper-humanism ([unity of human]{.mark} being[s and nature]{.mark})**
challenge Enlightenment worldviews. They **[reject]{.mark}** the
**[individualistic ontology]{.mark}** of human affairs in favor of a
wholistic or cosmological one]{.underline}. Milja Kurki writes: "The
relational perspective explored here [suggests that the sciences --
natural and social -- are undergoing a 'relational revolution,' [moving
from]{.mark} **Cartesian, Newtonian, and [empiricist ways of
knowing]{.mark}** [toward]{.mark} more **[relational onto]{.mark}logies
and [epistemologies]{.mark}** in line with not only **quantum science**
and relativity theory but also with **ecological thought** and
**decolonization** of the sciences]{.underline}."3 Relationalist views
envision a world of intense and entangled relationships deeply embedded
in historical and cosmological context, in which substantialist things
such as individuals and institutions do not exist or exist only in
emergent form when they are investigated. In this holistic and
processual universe, individual human beings have no location
(position), no alternative (choice), and no escape (only one observed
universe). The relationalist worldview draws from quantum science, in
which reality is not fixed in time or space but appears simultaneously
and unpredictably in multiple places and dissolves the distinction
between the observer (individual) and the observed (universe).

These different worldviews not only reflect different ontologies, they
prescribe different world politics. As Kurki infers, [the relationalist
turn entails a political agenda -- a broadside assault on western
rationality (reason), individuality (freedom), capitalism (growth), and
colonialism (control/hierarchy)]{.underline}.4 [In place of
Enlightenment goals, relationalism advocates a future agenda of
environmentalism that prioritizes climate change, hyper-humanism that
relinquishes human control of nature, and egalitarianism that flattens
material and moral differences]{.underline}. Much more is at stake than
abstract intellectual discourse. The relationalist turn may imperil the
very notion of free, reasoning individuals capable of self-conscious
thought and choice in human affairs.

This chapter insists that individual human beings remain at the
epicenter of social science inquiry. Quantum science does not mandate an
epochal transformation of worldviews from rationality and individualism
to relationality and cosmology.5 Modeling the social sciences after the
natural sciences is, in fact, a cardinal mistake. Relationalists
highlight that mistake when they argue that Enlightenment science under
Newton hijacked the social sciences and created a disenchanted modernity
of atoms (individuals) and laws (causality) devoid of spirit and
meaning. Now they make the same mistake by modeling the postmodern world
after quantum science. But the Newtonian world was never just a billiard
ball world of fixed entities, time and space. It was inspired and
limited by Christian beliefs that the divine did not roll dice (a
predictable world) and human beings were made equally worthy in the
image of the divine. And the quantum worldview today is not just a
mathematical model of entanglement and uncertainty; [it is also a social
vision to reimagine the political world as harmonious, contingent, and
relationally or group based]{.underline} (identity politics,
multiculturalism, etc.), [rather than as competitive, progressive, and
individually based (markets, individual human rights,
etc.)]{.underline}.

[The Enlightenment produced good and evil]{.underline}. This chapter
does not claim otherwise. The Enlightenment's crown jewel, however, was
the emancipation, for better and worse, of the individual human being as
a reasoning, responsible, and rights-seeking agent in society. [[On
balance]{.mark}, this [**secular, individually driven humanist**
worldview **was progressive**, **materially and socially**]{.mark}.
[Despite]{.mark} all of its **[wars]{.mark}** and **warts**, the
Enlightenment era superintended unparalleled [expansion of]{.mark}
material prosperity, human [longevity]{.mark}, public
[education]{.mark}, political [freedom]{.mark}]{.underline} (yes, more
democracies than ever before), [[and **global
equality**]{.underline}]{.mark} (yes, half of the world's population is
now middle class).6 [Any post-Enlightenment worldview that challenges
the individualist ontology of the Enlightenment has [a **high
bar**]{.mark} to meet]{.underline}.

The chapter proceeds in four parts. The first part explores the
relationship between the individual and the whole, the timeworn
conundrum of agency and structure. It contends that the individual
remains primary over structure in several principal ways: as a source of
endless diversity, a repository for the capability of reason, a portal
of entry for human conversation, and the only species thus far that
practices science and is capable of representing and studying itself.
[Individuals are not autonomous, but they have space in their embedded
situation for choice and change]{.underline}. The main issue between
this chapter and others in this volume is how much space they have and
where that space resides. [[**Relationalist** accounts]{.mark} tend to
[**discount agency** at the **individual** level]{.mark}, Weberian
accounts at the **structural** level. We **risk a lot** by
**disregarding either**]{.underline}.

The second and third parts address the content and juxtaposition of
competing worldviews. [How do we compare and test them?]{.underline}
This part [holds fast to the notion of a **universal capability** of
**individual human beings** to **reason** and a **universal method** of
**science** to **test** alternative propositions (worldviews) by
experiment against an outside physical and social world]{.underline}.
[To be sure, the **content** of reason and science is parochial and
**differs by culture**]{.underline}. In some worldviews, rational and
individualistic factors play the larger role, in others nonrational
(e.g., emotion, intuition) and holistic factors.7 [**If** these multiple
worldviews are **incommensurable**, however, we have **no way to
evaluate** and test them. Worldviews become religious not scientific
undertakings, adopted by faith not reason. On the other hand, if we
retain **science as a common method** (mathematics, experimentation), we
can **compare** and evaluate worldviews across different
cultures]{.underline}. In this section I assume that all worldviews
incorporate two elements: content, or their relative emphasis on
rational vs. nonrational factors; and scale, or their relative emphasis
on individualistic vs. structural levels of analysis.8

The fourth part addresses the ethics of different worldviews.
[**Worldviews have consequences** -- some **horrific**]{.underline},
such as the Holocaust. Who or what is accountable for these outcomes? If
Weberian worldviews have moral shortcomings -- and they do --
relationalist worldviews do as well. Calling for openness and multiple
worldviews (modernities), [**relationalist** views are at times quite
dogmatic]{.underline}. They pass judgment on worldviews as "right" or
"wrong" not as "false" or "not false," and speak of the pursuit of
"truth" against which, they claim, resistance is futile.9 They
[**downplay individual agency** and [emphasize **entangled
relationships**]{.mark}, conjuring up a **"[totalizing]{.mark}"**
worldview that marginalizes individual rights and privacy. They blur
distinctions between science and religion and argue that worldviews "are
inescapably normative."]{.underline}10 [Yet, curiously, relationalists
say little about the substance of relationalist norms. They **[pass
over]{.mark}** the question of **[how a relationalist world]{.mark}**,
in which all possibilities are welcomed, [**defends itself**
against]{.mark} the **[barbarity]{.mark}** of an Adolf Hitler or a
Joseph Stalin; they infer that other religions (Hinduism, Buddhism) are
more in tune with nature than Christianity; they refrain from spirited
criticism of worldviews that discriminate against women (Saudi Arabia,
India) or Muslims (China); and they blame America and the Enlightenment
for elevating European worldviews and marginalizing others]{.underline}.
Weberian worldviews, [by contrast]{.underline}, with their
[**individualistic** and **disaggregated ontology**, **accommodate
alternative worldviews** as long as these worldviews submit to objective
falsification and do not claim that their world is the only world which
cannot be tested or resisted]{.underline}.11

6.1 The Individual and the Whole

As noted, Enlightenment worldviews are multiple. Where do we start?
Michael Barnett provides a pretty good definition of liberal
Enlightenment worldviews: "By privileging reason over superstition,
change over tradition, science over religion, and, most importantly,
humanity over discrimination, enlightenment thought held that people
should be judged as individuals and on their achievements, not their
religion or other discriminating factors."12 In this world, individuals
are not only real and significant, they are morally and ethically
accountable! They do not disappear, along with other "things," from a
Newtonian/Weberian world of "essence and identity" to join a
relationalist world of "different kinds of dances."13

Where did this emphasis on individualism come from? In the early
Enlightenment, it came from Isaac Newton and his application of
individual reason to the study of nature. "Think of it," Gale
Christianson writes, "a lone human being bent low over a desk, supplied
with nothing more than a quill pen, a pot of homemade ink, and countless
sheets of blank paper, calculating precisely how the cosmos goes."14 In
the late Enlightenment, Max Weber generalized this application of
reasoning to the study of human as well as natural sciences. Individual
human beings, not the divine or prophets, interpreted reality. In
Weber's sociology, according to Stephen Kalberg, "individuals are
genuine actors capable of interpreting their social realities and of
initiating creative action."15 (Note the word "creative": the capacity
to imagine something that is neither embedded in the past nor
represented in the present.) Kalberg continues: "Weber welcomed
emphatically the freedoms and rights the modern world bestowed upon the
individual16 \... Individuals act, for Weber, not social organisms or
collectivities \... meaning is found only in the consciousness of human
beings."17 In their introduction to From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology,
Gerth and Mills concur: "His \[Weber's\] point of departure and the
ultimate unit of his analysis is the individual person."18 In Weber's
own words, "action in the sense of a subjectively understandable
orientation of behavior exists only as the behavior of one or more
individual human beings."19

Weber considers four types of social action rooted in individual
behavior: means--ends rational action (rational choice), value-rational
action (idealistic or ideological), affectual action (feeling or
emotional), and traditional or customary action (habitual).20 Only one,
means--ends rationality, is materially based. He does not conflate the
social world with the natural world. Reality is not dead matter,
disenchanted. It is both material (means--ends) and ideal
(value-rational), emotional (affectual) and habitual (practices).
Enchantment persists. It just doesn't rule human minds at the expense of
reason, as it did in pre-Enlightenment thought.

Per Weber, ideal and material interests intersect to yield patterning
action. This patterning action is shaped by both individuals and
structure. Structures exist, to be sure. Weber speaks of "value spheres"
which prescribe obligations in various life spheres and "are not created
by individuals."21 But value spheres conflict; there are no universally
valid value spheres; and the individual adjudicates among them: "Torn
between conflicting obligations derived from different value spheres,
the individual must simply choose."22 For Weber, this choice is free,
not determined by science or higher norms. As Gerth and Mills write, "He
\[Weber\] felt that freedom consists not in realizing alleged historical
necessities but rather in making deliberate choices between open
alternatives."23 For Weber, "choice is the task of life itself."24 While
Weber accords a role to structure, he warns against the holistic,
allencompassing notion of structure that Grove emphasizes in
relationalism. As Kalberg writes, "organic theories, according to Weber,
are helpful and indeed indispensable, yet, if utilized other than as a
means of facilitating preliminary conceptualization, a high risk of
'reification' arises: 'society' and the 'organic whole' rather than the
individual may become viewed as the single important level of
analysis"25

Relationalists reject this Weberian view of individualism. They indict
individualism as "the inability of man to see itself as part of nature
due to a Christian legacy of seeing humans as 'lifted' above nature."26
The original sin is hierarchy, "the 'human' standing over the
'environment',"27 free and separate from nature (animals, plants) and
other human beings (society), able potentially to surmount heritage and
context, dethrone the architects of authority (church and state), and
shape, in part, the world of the future. As Kurki suggests, this heresy
of hierarchy derives from the Protestant worldview that human beings are
called upon by reason and faith to explore, master, and grow the natural
universe around them. By fostering such heresy, Christianity did not
unleash freedom; it unleashed the master-less man, the rapacious
capitalist, and the relentless colonialist.

Relationalists minimize the role of individual reason in human affairs
and categorically reject any universal principles derived from reason.
As Kurki writes, "knowing through reason is a particular way of
materializing the world, not a universal manifestation of some abstract
principles."28 Nevertheless, the capability of individual human beings
to reason and give meaning to the world around them is universal, even
if the content of reason and its multiple manifestations are parochial
and differ by culture, religion, and other factors. As Allan points
out,29 the application of reason or rationalization takes many localized
forms. Individuals are endlessly diverse and wrapped up in many parts:
heritage, race, class, nationality, emotion, psychology, intuition,
charisma, character, reason, religion, civilization, cosmology, and so
on. Many of these parts are deeply embedded and constitute the
historical antecedents or "inheritance" that Allan emphasizes; they
anchor individuals in place. Reason, however, is the one part that
offers the human being a potential escape from this procrustean
embeddedness.30 Incorporating self-consciousness, reason "lifts up" the
individual human being to investigate, organize, study, and influence
nature and society. Reason facilitates reflection, discussion, and
selfstudy, offering a portability across differing worldviews that
emotion, intuition, and religion do not. In some worldviews, reason
plays a bigger or prior role; in others, intuition or religion does.31
But in all cultures reasoning is present if individuals choose to apply
it. To argue otherwise is to discriminate, to endow a particular
individual or culture with a capability of reason that other individuals
and cultures do not possess. And to ascribe reason to nonhuman beings
(plants and animals) ignores the obvious fact that they do not have that
capability yet, at least not in sufficient measure to permit self-study.
When they do, they will join the world of humans and represent
themselves. Hyper-humanism will have arrived.

In a sense, [the capability to **reason** is the **agency** of modern
human life]{.underline}. [This agency is distributed at all layers or
scales of human activity, individual and collective]{.underline}. It is
perhaps most accessible on the individual scale; but without the
structures of schools and free societies that educate and protect it,
reason soon withers, locked up in monasteries, gulags, and samizdats.
Thus, individuals and the groups they form are never completely
autonomous from society. [Indeed, at birth, they are relationally
constituted without choice. But subsequently]{.underline}, based on the
Weberian worldview, [individuals may be educated by reason
and]{.underline} reasoning communities (that's us, [the
**academy**]{.underline}) [to determine meaning for themselves and to
**choose practices and communities** that meet their standards of
reality and morality]{.underline}. [Relationships are important, but
**relationships**, **unlike individuals**, are not self-conscious and
**do not exercise reason**]{.underline}. [Somewhere in the relationalist
world, therefore, **agency** -- by which I mean self-conscious,
reasoning individual human beings and the interactional (not
intra-actional as in relationalism) communities they join and leave --
**is the starting** and enduring **point** of reflective inquiry. For
Weberian thought, the bottom line is that **human agency**, at
**whatever level** it may exist, is **sufficient** enough to provide
meaningful choice]{.underline}.32

[Individualism is indispensable for several other reasons. First,
**individual human beings are the only actors that can represent
themselves**. The kind of **discussion** we are having in this volume
**would not be possible without individuals**. Notice there are **no
institutions** authoring a chapter, **no representatives of the embedded
world** we inhabit -- **no community practices**, background or tacit
knowledge, cosmological elements, religious communities, relationalist
bundles or folds, quantum worlds, or any other holistic entity. **Not
even AI** (artificial intelligence) -- that is, no robots equivalent to
the individual human being, at least not yet]{.underline}.33

Second, individualism is the source of endless diversity in human
affairs. No two reasoning individuals are exactly the same! This is a
remarkable feature of human evolution and distinguishes "human"
particles studied by the social sciences from "natural" particles
studied by natural scientists. Being "unlike," human beings do not
equate with "like atoms" in a Newtonian world or "like particles/waves"
in a quantum world. To impose the natural science model on the social
sciences commits the second sin of Aristotle's understanding of
equality: it treats unequal things -- natural particles and human beings
-- equally.34

Third, human particles seem to be, again so far, the only specie that
can conceptualize and study themselves, the only specie that is
self-conscious and can practice both natural and social science.35 If
nonhuman beings (animals) were included in this exercise, how would they
communicate and represent themselves? They would have to depend upon
human beings. But who gave human beings that right? As Kurki
acknowledges, "we represent them even at present, but often badly: we
can learn to represent them and ourselves and our symbiotic relations
better."36 Maybe so, but isn't the presumption that we can represent
them at all without their consent an exercise of hierarchical or
colonial control? I'm not arguing against speaking out for animal
rights. It's a good thing, in my worldview, when human beings take care
of all living things and nurture nature. I'm suggesting instead that
human beings are the only creatures that raise these questions.
Nonhumans are not yet at the table or, as far as we know, clamoring for
a seat.

Finally, [**even if** individuals are totally entrapped in the embedded
features of their **environment** (that is, not autonomous at all), they
are still the only channels by which we learn about worldviews,
including holistic ones that deny individuality]{.underline}. Worldviews
don't emerge out of the ether. They emerge from the mind and experience
of a single individual.37 [We can get to the "real" world of
relationalism or any other "real" world only by starting in an
individualist world. The **individual remains** the portal of **entry**
for **worldviews** and intellectual **discourse about
them**]{.underline}.

6.2 Multiple Worldviews

There seems to be, at least to me, a consensus in this volume as to what
worldviews are. They are a combination of values together with methods
by which we navigate the world around us.38 Without methods, worldviews
become pure ideals or truth. They cannot be tested; they can only be
accepted, like religion. And without values, worldviews become
meaningless methods leading to anomie, the ultimate disenchantment.
Critics like to characterize Weber's approach as "methodological
individualism," but they ignore the prior value he placed on the
reasoning individual. The individual was not a tool of analysis; it was
the valued agent that gave meaning to analysis.

One way to compare worldviews, therefore, is to examine the relative
content of worldviews -- that is, the relative role of rational (reason)
vs. nonrational (religion, emotion, etc.) factors in various worldviews,
and the relative level of analysis being emphasized (i.e. individual vs.
structure). Weberian worldviews tend to be heavy on reason and the
individual level of analysis, relationalist worldviews on nonrational
factors and the holistic level of analysis.39

In this volume, Milja Kurki, Peter Katzenstein, and [**Jairus Grove**
make the case for a **strong relationalism** that **minimizes rational
factors** in human behavior and adopts a deeply historical and holistic
level of analysis]{.underline}. Katzenstein highlights the nonrational
aspects of reality: "The interpretation of reality as consisting only of
risk is not readily open to rational reconstruction or refutation."40
Kurki emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything: "nothing in the
universe is outside of relational unfolding of the universe -- not even
the scientists or the laws of the universe which are also made
relationally."41 [Grove prioritizes intuition over reason]{.underline}
(see footnote 31) [and, while acknowledging that some layers or scales
of agency may exist within the holistic structure, argues that such
agency does not equate with a rational subject or individual human
being. Instead, agency is relational at all scales: "We are not
constituted by relations. We are relations."]{.underline} The individual
"comes from the unity we 'feel' as an 'I'." [**[Actors become
assemblages]{.mark}**, ensembles, and folds that exceed the particular
human subject and appear depending on "at what scale one asks the
question."]{.underline} "The scale of the investigator," Grove adds,
"radically alters what appears as a part and what appears as a whole."42

Bentley Allan's worldview is slightly less holistic and more attentive
to creative elites, albeit still acting at a deeply embedded level of
analysis. He starts with cosmological elements -- ontology, episteme,
temporality, cosmogony, and human destiny -- that provide the
ingredients for worldviews and exist outside worldviews in the sense
that they come first.43 Then, according to Allan, "creative actors" mix
and match these elements in various ways to produce worldviews or "local
stabilizations of cosmological elements." The content of these
stabilizations is not universal and depends on the history and
experiences of different cultures. In the case of western thought,
rationalization produced a localized worldview of "materialism" and
"object-orientation." This combination gave rise to "modernist values of
rationality, control, and growth which serve as the basis of world
politics today."44 In other civilizations, rationalization created
nonmaterialist and "subject" oriented worlds (Haitian Iwa, Buddhism).
Allan creates more space for individual agency: "Agency is always
possible but never omnipotent. Creative agents must work with and
against the cosmological and institutional resources at hand."45 The
question is whether contemporary elites can interpret or reinterpret
their inherited experience and alter it in any way that significantly
affects the future. Who are the creative elites today that become the
embedded historical elites tomorrow?

Presenjit Duara takes one element of Allan's cosmological menu, namely
temporality, and links it, via the "epistemic engine" of the
nation-form, with the Enlightenment worldview of modernity. Like Allan,
he is sensitive to the multiple content of Enlightenment modernity --
autocratic, emphasizing nonrational and holistic factors, as well as
liberal, emphasizing reason and individualistic factors -- and regards
agency as weak even at collective scales. That leads him to wonder if
the agentic force of civil society, which he sees as the most hopeful
challenger of the Enlightenment nation-form, is ultimately too weak, too
diffused to succeed.46

Timothy Byrnes drops down below the cosmological level of analysis and
starts with religions, not cosmological elements, as foundational to
worldviews. Religions have moral content, are multiple, and are
concerned with truth not just process, interaction, or inanimate
cosmological elements. He raises the interesting question of how we can
know separate religions. Because religion is not only a way of seeing
the world but also a way of being in the world, how do we bridge
different worlds of being? He advocates a path of "informed empathy."47
You stand outside other religions and become informed, and then you try
to imagine that other religion by moving as close as you can to it
without assuming or usurping its identity. But how close is too close?
When do you invade or take over the other religion? Here Byrnes
acknowledges a role for agency. Religions exist separately; they do not
smear into one another like wave functions. On the other hand, religious
communities are deeply embedded in the historical process. They are
mutually constituted with other factors like politics, such that "a
separation of religion and politics is a chimera."48

Michael Barnett disaggregates the analysis still further. Unlike Byrnes,
he does not see religion and politics as mutually constituted
(holistically entangled) and thus explores a critical possibility --
rooted cosmopolitanism -- in which the two variables are separated --
namely a Jewish community in America committed to a cosmopolitan
theology and humanism, but rooted in a non-Jewish territorial state. By
moving to a lower level of analysis, he retrieves a variable and a
degree of freedom that is otherwise lost when variables are mutually
constituted.49 For Barnett, Jewish worldviews derive from independent
forces of religion and politics (territoriality) and have distinctive
qualities that define "who is and can be a member, and what are the
boundaries between themselves and others." These worldviews worry about
borders where entanglement may threaten security. They also have "core
tenets." A worldview may change not only from external entanglements but
also from internal tensions when members of the community begin to
debate its core characteristics.50 To be sure, external circumstances
still matter. Interacting in America, the Jewish community by and large
favored an open, civic nationalism of cosmopolitanism; interacting in
the Middle East, it chose a closed, ethnic nationalism of separateness.
Yet value commitments or agency may hold the key to future outcomes.
Barnett speculates that Jews in America and Israel may drift apart "if
American Jews continued to orbit around a rooted cosmopolitanism; and
Israeli Jews migrated from a prophetic Zionism to ethnonationalist
Zionism."51

In adopting a Weberian worldview, Mark Haas and I accord the greatest
emphasis to the role of reason and the individual level of analysis. To
some significant degree, leaders (elites) act independently in the
present both to reinterpret the past and to shape the future. While they
form groups and adapt to social circumstances, they also change those
circumstances and ultimately create over time the structures that define
a particular historical experience.52 Some structures may be harder to
change than others. Some may never change -- in most cases not because
they are unchangeable, but rather because human actions and interactions
have not yet become aware of them or mobilized sufficient effort to
engage and transform them. From the perspective developed by Haas/ Nau,
most structures are susceptible to change, not by one action or one
human being (or even by one generation or one nation) but by a train of
actions and interactions moving across time in a similar direction.
Agency is distributed across all levels and time but it is strongest at
lower levels and contemporaneously where it constantly "stirs the pot"
to inhibit, shape, or diffuse subsequent structures at more holistic
levels.53

I entered the investigation of worldviews by trying to find a framework
to compare foreign policy debates in aspiring powers (China, India,
Iran, Japan, and Russia) and determine whether those debates were moving
away from or toward the foreign policy debates in the United States.54 I
was reaching for a structural level of analysis that would go beyond
individual events and leaders (the focus of quotidian foreign policy)
but not ossify in incommensurable cultures and civilizations. I created
a framework of four schools of foreign policy thought -- nationalist,
realist, liberal internationalist, and conservative internationalist. To
be as objective as possible, I defined these schools in neutral terms of
scope (limited, expansive), means (military, diplomatic/economic), and
ends (accept or transform world) of foreign policy, rather than
ideological or substantive terms of liberalism, fascism, Islamism,
communism, culture, and the like. I started, in short, with a set of
rationalist categories (science as method) presumed to be accessible to
all cultures through a universal human capacity to reason (reason as
universal). The country specialists in the study said the framework
could not be applied across cultures. Categories don't mean the same
thing in different cultures. Well, we persuaded them to try anyway, and
they were surprised at the extent to which it did illuminate the
respective movement of debates among the countries.

Thus, **[[it is possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I concluded, [**[to
study]{.mark}** the **[behavior]{.mark}** of alternative
cultures/religions/worldviews **[without]{.mark}** either
**[essentializing]{.mark}** those worldviews (**danger** of the
**Weberian** approach) [or **shackling**]{.mark} them [in a
**structure** that can be **challenged, if at all, only from
within**]{.mark} (**danger** of the **relationalist**
approach)]{.underline}.

6.3 Worldviews and Science

[To do this, however, we **[need standards]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
Enlightenment gave us the standard of science as a universal method:
mathematics, experimental practice. That method depends upon the
assumption of a real "objective" world even if we can never know that
world. We ask and test how that world works, based on the values we hold
(e.g., world is predictable or uncertain), and the real world pushes
back against our experimental inquiries and tells us which worldviews
are consistent with it and which are not. Notice [science as method
tells us only which worldviews are not false (i.e., not inconsistent
with reality); it never tells us which worldviews are true (i.e., the
actual reality)]{.underline}.

[This is a crucial point]{.underline}, at least for me. [Truth lies not
in the universal method of science but in the multiple values that
inform science as method]{.underline}. Newton's Christian views led him
to expect and practice a "predictable" science; Weber's human-centric
views led him to anticipate a "progressive" science; the values held by
Weber's critics led them to expect a "disenchanted" science; Hitler's
fascist and Stalin's communist worldviews led them to promote "racist"
and "pseudo" sciences (Mengele and Lysenko). [Relationalists value
conjunctive relationality (not individuals) and pursue a science of
local not universal knowledge. Values inform all worldviews, but science
as method tells us which worldviews fare best against an assumed
objective world]{.underline}.

Strong relationalists reject science as a universal method of testing
against an objective reality. They talk about "different sciences"55 and
argue that "science \... is not defined by a 'method'."56 Quoting
Roberto Unger and Lee Smolin, Kurki concludes: "There is no scientific
method, science is fundamentally defined as a collection of ethical
communities."57 Here we come very close to worldviews as pure values
(ethical communities) with methods being anything -- scientific,
magical, religious -- that values dictate. Each community defines its
own value and methods, and presumably the "real" world accommodates them
all because there is no common method to determine which worldviews are
not consistent with an assumed "real" (i.e., objective) world.

There are three layers of uncertainty involved in this issue of
scientific objectivity (universality). Newtonian science studies the
natural (nonhuman) world: objects such as planets and particles which
cannot change their characteristics and which scientists neither like
nor dislike. Laws are fixed and cannot be affected by the scientist. The
human observer is also situated outside and independent of the natural
world. In Newtonian science, the observer can be mostly objective even
though scientists still operate in an intersubjective, ethical (social)
community (for Newton, the Church of England) that defines what is or is
not to be investigated and expected.

Weberian science studies not only the natural but also the social world
in which human beings are involved and can change their minds. Laws are
no longer fixed, and the observer, though still distinct, studies things
it likes and dislikes, such as churches, trade unions, markets,
political parties, etc. While Weberian scientists assume they can strip
their social preferences from their scientific pursuits, they are human,
not superhuman, and can succeed only up to a point. Objectivity is more
elusive.58

Quantum science adds a third level of uncertainty.59 It assumes that the
human observer is not only studying itself but is now inextricably
entangled with the world it is studying. The observer, the observed, and
the background exist only together (there is no separate individual,
observation, or background), and emerge only when a particular question
(measurement) is asked (made). Observation triggers or collapses the
entangled quantum world and reveals the only world we can know. There is
no world behind the observed one. Objectivity, in short, is now out of
the question. The world depends entirely on the questions the observer
asks.

Relationalism in general pushes us toward this quantum level of
uncertainty. But a strong relationalism goes beyond quantum science in
two ways: it drastically reduces (if not eliminates) the role of the
observer (the individual investigator), and it gives up the universal
method of experimental science in favor of a localized and diluted
method of "trial and error."60 Quantum science does neither. In the case
of the observer, it elevates, not eliminates, the significance of the
observer (individual). Through the act of measuring, the observer now
literally "creates" ("gives meaning to") the world we observe, which is
the only world we can know.61 As Steven Weinberg muses, "Man may indeed
be the measure of all things."62 That seems to reinforce the Weberian
worldview that individuals are a significant location of agency. But in
quantum physics the observer now has no way to test observations against
an objective world because there is no objective world. The universal
scientific method is no longer available, and we have to settle for a
localized form of experimentation based on trial and error, yielding
results which cannot be generalized. That point seems to reinforce the
relationalist worldview.

But wait a minute. Some Newtonian (classical) physicists still contest
the quantum proposition that there is no objective world. They argue
that wave collapse is going on all the time objectively in a real but
unknown world behind the observed world. They seek evidence of such
"objective" wave collapse, independent of "subjective" measurement.63
Interestingly, in these efforts, Newtonian and quantum scientists use
the same methods of science, mathematics and experiments, but derive
very different content from those methods. Neither, however, has given
up on the idea of science as a universal method. Quantum science may
still prevail, but if it does it won't prevail forever, any more than
Newtonian science did. Science advances from one falsified theory to
another "not yet" falsified theory, not from false to true (at which
point science ends).64 And, since scientists tell us that we know only
about 4 percent of the universe as we see it, the real world that we
don't see is likely to remain elusive for a very long time to come.
Scientists therefore should not speak about "the reality" let alone "the
truth" of their findings, only about a method that tells them which
findings are not false or not yet false.

In the meantime, quantum science raises some harrowing ethical issues
when applied to the human world: the potential of unhinged human
observers playing the role of creator, and the absence of any common
moral standard by which to hold varying worldviews accountable.

6.4 Worldviews and Ethics

Having downsized if not eliminated the role of the reasoning individual
in shaping worldviews, and having adopted a quantum view that the world
we see is the only one there is, relationalism in this volume has
surprisingly little to say about ethical and moral responsibility,
either individual or collective. This neglect follows from relationalist
logic. Because the world is holistic and incorporates all possibilities,
there is little or no choice, and hence little or no responsibility. We
have removed practically all degrees of human freedom to act and change
the world. What's left are different values or religions and related
methods of science which are compatible but not commensurable,
harmonious but not integral, and equivalent but not competitive.
Katzenstein writes:

both science and religion are variegated practices of different ways of
knowing \... Both inquire into the possibility that the world might be
different than it appears. Both are instances of us living in multiple
realities and thus are examples of the profound human capacity of
meaning-making \... Religious and scientific practices are rooted in the
world of play.65

Play is an interesting term, implying a game or imaginary reality. In
that game, however, what are the rules, and who makes them? Maybe no
rules are needed. Science and religion are drawing closer together: "the
border between quantum mechanics and religion is porous."66 Religious
values and scientific methods do not collide, they resonate. Multiple
beliefs and realities cut or "smear" into one another like quantum
waves. They blend, harmonize.

[Such a harmonious concatenation of multiple worldviews expresses an
aspiration that we all share. If relationalism is nothing more than an
appeal for curiosity, openness, and tolerance, it is welcomed. But what
**if multiple worldviews do not harmonize**? What if some worldviews
condone slavery, deny individual human rights, justify genocide,
discriminate against women (Islam in Saudi Arabia) or minorities
(Uighurs in China), wage holy war against the infidel, and so on? In the
flattened ontology that relationalists advocate, are all worldviews
"true" or "moral"?]{.underline}

[The issue here is not whether human beings are entangled but what the
content of that entanglement is]{.underline}. The content of
entanglement is what Haas and I try to get at with the concept of
"ideological distance," whether worldviews are converging or
diverging.67 According to relationalists, the quantum social world is
cooperative; ideological distance is always at or near zero. Conversely,
the Weberian world is conflictual; ideological distance is always
positive and sometimes large. As Alexander Wendt explains:

If your starting premise for thinking about social life is atomistic,
then conflict is the natural starting point for life -- every organism
is out for itself, they're all selfish, it's all about survival of the
fittest. Cooperation is very difficult because we're all separate and
all trying to survive and do our own thing. On the other hand, if your
starting point is holistic, where everything's entangled, then
cooperation may be much easier to achieve. It may even be the default
situation, and conflict is the exception. So it turns upside down a lot
of the foundational assumptions, I think, of mainstream social
science.68

[[Whether **social life** is **atomistic** or **entangled**]{.mark},
however, [does **not tell**]{.mark} **us much about
[outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The master--slave relationship is
entangled but not cooperative. The relationship between liberal states
in the democratic peace is separate but not conflictual. No conflict in
either case may mean no freedom to challenge slavery or democracy, and
therefore no moral accountability -- a totalitarian entanglement for
which no one is responsible and which, apparently, no one can change.

Over time, of course, the content of social entanglement does change.
Outright slavery is no longer acceptable. Communism, at least in the
Soviet form, is gone. How does such change occur, and who is responsible
for the original conflict and its eventual outcome? Katzenstein writes:
"Divergent worldviews do not get resolved by appeals to logic and
evidence but through individual experiences and social processes."69 So,
[[**how** do "**individual experience**" and "**social processes**"
**accomplish**]{.mark} this **[resolution?]{.mark}** If **logic** and
**evidence** are ruled out, what [are]{.mark} the **[means]{.mark} of
resolution** -- emotion, habit, intuition, etc.? Are these means
peaceful or **[violent?]{.mark}** Practically **[everyone
agrees]{.mark}** that [Nazism had to be defeated by
**rationalist**]{.mark} **instruments** (**Grove** might say
**[assemblages]{.mark}**) **[of power]{.mark}**; Nazi ideology could not
be blended or accommodated by relationalist effects of
norms]{.underline}.

[The **relationalist** worldview **[lacks any ethical standard
for]{.mark} evaluating or [resolving divergencies]{.mark}** in the
content of alternative worldviews]{.underline}. [**[Everything is local
and specific]{.mark}** even though the world itself is holistic and
entangled]{.underline}. And all events are uncertain even though the
quantum model itself is certain and can't be challenged. [[The
**combination** of]{.mark} the **[loss of objectivity]{.mark}** (no real
world behind the observed one) [and]{.mark} the **[multiplicity of
incommensurable]{.mark}** but equivalent [**worldviews** leaves]{.mark}
almost [everything **up for grabs**]{.mark}. A [**flattened ontology**
leads to a **flattened ethical landscape**]{.mark} as well]{.underline}.

Kurki seeks a relational ethic of response-ability: an ability to
respond sensitively, openly, and thoughtfully to human and nonhuman
relationships.70 It is an appealing insight. But in a world in which
there are no things (individuals) or backgrounds (objective world),
where exactly is this responsibility located, and what is its substance?
[**Grove**, for example, [sees **violence as relational** but **not
easily overcome**]{.mark} by consciousness-raising]{.underline}.71 You
can become aware of relations, he points out, without coming to a sense
of the common good. Kurki ponders the same point about knowledge:
science "is part of becoming \... what this means is that we do not have
clear criteria for good or bad knowledge."72 The substance of ethics or
knowledge, what is good and what is bad, is hard to pin down. Even
harder to pin down is the location of ethical responsibility. In Grove's
examination of presidential powers and nuclear weapons, he admits that
the president is ultimately unaware of who or what is in control."73 And
if no one is in control, no one has responsibility.

[**Responsibility** is **not merely** the "**ability to respond**." It's
the ability to respond "by someone or something" in a "substantive" way
toward some moral "end."]{.underline} Weber distinguished between an
"ethic of responsibility," which Kurki's formulation might capture, and
an "ethic of ultimate ends," which Kurki does not consider.74 Perhaps
this is because [[an **ethic** of ultimate ends **requires more than a
relationship**]{.mark}; it **requires** [a **direction**]{.mark}, an
arrow, not simply a flat surface or "fold."]{.underline}

As noted earlier, Grove suggests that "the scale of the investigator
\... radically alters what appears as a part and what appears as a
whole." If that's the case, the individual investigator, the individual,
is back at the heart of a quantum-based social science model.75 The
Weberian commitment to the individual human being as the source of
meaning and morality in a multiscalar world remains indispensable. That
does not rule out agency at other levels. Relationalist factors are
multiple, real, and often confining. But, to a meaningful extent, they
form out of the interpretations and interactions of reasoning
individuals, they change because of individual initiatives, and they
dissolve because individuals leave and join other relationships. The
only "authenticated" actors beyond the individual in a Weberian
worldview, therefore, are those groups, institutions, classes, etc.,
that are chosen or affirmed voluntarily by the consent of individual
human beings acting in a setting where they have a meaningful degree of
choice. [Holistic worldviews **[diminish]{.mark} that degree of
[choice]{.mark} and consent, [however well-meaning]{.mark}** they may be
by embracing all possibilities]{.underline}.

The Weberian view judges and chooses. That is neither easy nor pleasant.
No one wants to be accused of being judgmental. But we all do it.76
Indeed, how does one avoid it? The Holocaust was a monstrous act of
evil. How do we understand it in a world that blends religion and
science? As Barnett (Chapter 5) shows, the Holocaust poses a wrenching
question of existence, not just a vague smearing of relationships and
"response-ability" to change or becoming. If such a question can be
answered only in a specific situation (when the quantum wave function
collapses), then we have abandoned both our humanity and our influence
on world affairs.

Am I forcing everyone into a Weberian worldview?77 Possibly, but [I am
**[not]{.mark}** saying that the Weberian view is **[the only
view]{.mark}**. I am saying that I **[can]{.mark}** find a location in
the **Weberian universe** to [**host** an **alternative**]{.mark} point
of view (and do so when I compare the worldviews]{.underline} in this
volume; see earlier in this chapter); [I **[cannot]{.mark}** find such a
location **[in a relationalist universe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the
beginning, this project postulated a revolution in natural and social
science thought rejecting Enlightenment and Newtonian worldviews. In
later stages, Katzenstein emphasized complementarities among Newtonian
and Post-Newtonian worldviews.78 By complementarity, however,
Katzenstein forces the Newtonian view into the relationalist universe
where "the determinist or probability-inflected Newtonian world can be
thought of as a special case that reveals itself when the quantum world
of infinite possibilities and radical uncertainty collapses."79 Bottom
line? There is no location in the relationist world for dissent.
Alternatives either fit into the quantum world or are patently false.

Moreover, understanding another worldview does not mean accepting it or
making it equivalent. Would the world be better off today if the
Reformation and Enlightenment had not occurred, or if the Haitian lwa
not the Weberian worldview had dominated world politics after 1600?80
Best, you say, if neither dominated? OK, but spell out the global
consequences of the Haitian worldview or the specific parameters of
equal coexistence which makes all worldviews (fascism, communism)
acceptable and worth learning from. Unless we specify "what" we learn
from "which" worldview, we are simply treating worldviews like
souvenirs, collecting and trivializing them. Worse, we are opening the
floodgates to any worldview with no standard for judging good and bad.
Maybe the relationalist turn pops open an irresistible, new window of a
more harmonious world that we have missed because of the atomistic and
competitive frame of western modernism. But maybe it doesn't. And if it
doesn't, not only material progress but individual freedom is at stake.

Which leads to a final question: where do relationalist cosmologies
place the divine? What lies behind the Big Bang? [Relationalists are
eager to unify the human and natural worlds and see a growing
commonality between science and religion]{.underline}. The obstacle to
unifying the human and natural worlds, however, is an understanding of
consciousness which humans have and nonhumans do not. And the obstacle
to uniting the scientific and religious (supranatural) worlds is an
understanding of the soul, the human capacity to imagine the divine.81
[**[Separating]{.mark}** these three worlds -- **[nature]{.mark}**,
**[humanity]{.mark}**, [and the **divine**]{.mark} -- has [led to
abuse]{.mark}: humanity masquerading as gods (the Church before the
Enlightenment) or humanity "lifted up" to control nature (the critics'
view of the Enlightenment). [But **uniting** them]{.mark} may lead to
**[even worse]{.mark}** abuse]{.underline}. What stands in the way of a
science that poses as a religion or a nature that restrains
prosperity?82 [[By **blurring the distinction** between **religion and
science**, **nature and humanity**]{.mark}, relationalism
**[weakens]{.mark} Enlightenment [institutions]{.mark}** [that
**separate** **state and church**, **markets and feudalism**]{.mark}. It
**[enables]{.mark}** potentially powerful [**new gods** of
**unchallenged expertise and science**]{.mark} to take the
stage]{.underline} (because, remember, there is no objective universe).
We could wind up [again in a pre-Enlightenment world wherein scientists
and their **[authoritarian enablers usurp the power of
privilege]{.mark}** to suppress the rights of reasoning individuals.
Resistance would be anti-science and futile, as it was antiGod and
heresy in pre-Enlightenment times]{.underline}. As Timothy Byrnes
writes, "if a relational cosmology is grounded in faith or in the
pursuit of what is 'really real,' then the unknown itself is the basis
of Truth and the human propensity to resistance is ultimately futile."83
And if the unknown is truth and cannot be resisted, [the **Dark
Ages**]{.underline} may be [upon us **once again**]{.underline}.

6.5 Conclusion

I come back to the **[[need]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, [[to
**maintain a**]{.mark} **Weberian worldview**, whatever the debate in
physics, **if only** to retain a "[critical]{.mark}" [perspective on the
**totalizing** tendencies of]{.mark} the **[relationalist]{.mark}**
school of [thought]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Mike Barnett concludes,
"Without worldviews we would not know how to go on, and would be lost in
the wilds until a charismatic leader arrived to provide guidance."84 In
the barren "wilds" of relationalism (the jungle), that charismatic
leader would probably be a totalizing ideology, one admitting of no
alternatives -- radical Islam under the Caliphate, Medieval Christianity
under the Inquisition, totalitarian atheism under fascism and communism,
or scientific elitism under a relationalist banner that substitutes
expertise for politics and human choice. The Weberian worldview is still
a necessary defense against that sort of evil.

Baptist University, "Rhetoric, Resistance, and Criticism: A Response to
Sloop and Ono", Philosophy & Rhetoric, Volume 32, Number 1, p. 96-101

[My [concern]{.mark}]{.underline} with this movement [[centers
around]{.mark} an issue that]{.underline} Sloop and Ono [seem to take as
a given, namely, [the **role of the critic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
one hand, calling for the systematic investigation of existing
marginalized discourses is a natural extension both of critical rhetoric
(see McKerrow 1989, 1991) and of the general ideological turn in
criticism (see Wander 1983). On the other hand, [the ease of transition
from criticism in the service of resistance to criticism of resistance
may obscure the need to address some fundamental issues regarding the
general function of rhetorical criticism in an uncertain and contentious
world]{.underline}. Beyond [licensing the critic to engage in political
struggle]{.underline}, Sloop and Ono advocate the pursuit of covert
resistant discourses.

Such a move not [only stretches our understanding of rhetoric and
criticism, but also alters significantly the relationship between critic
and out- law. Critical interrogation of dominant discursive practices in
the service of political/cultural reform is supplanted in favor of
[positioning]{.mark} covert out- law [communities as **objects of
investigation**]{.mark}. Invited to seek out subversive discourses,
[**the critic** is]{.mark} positioned as [the **active agent of change**
and]{.mark} the out-law [discourse becomes]{.mark} **merely
[instrumental]{.mark}**. Rather than academic criticism acting in
service of everyday acts of resistance, everyday acts of resistance are
put into the service of academic criticism.]{.underline}

Rhetorical resistance

That we are \"caught within conflicting logics of justice that are
culturally struggled over\" (Sloop and Ono 1997, 50) and that rhetoric
is employed in these struggles seems an uncontroversial statement.
Despite the theoretical miasma surrounding judgment, Sloop and Ono
accurately note, the material process of rendering judgments (and of
disputing the logics of litigation) continues in the world of actually
practiced discourse. In the materially contested world, rhetoric is
utilized both by those seeking to secure the grounds of dominant
judgment and by those seeking to undermine or supplant dominant cultural
logics with some out-law notion of justice.

The distinction between these two cultural groups, \"in-law\" and out-
law, however, deserves some consideration prior to any discussion of the
role of the critic as implied in the out-law discourse project. The
discourse of the dominant or those within the bounds of superordinate
logics of litigation is reminiscent of Michel De Certeau\'s (1984)
strategic discourse. For De Certeau, strategies are utilized by those
who have authority by virtue of their proper position. Strategies
exploit the institutionally guaranteed background consensus by which
power relations (and litigations) are maintained and advanced. In
contrast, tactics are utilized by those having no proper place of
authority within the discursive economy who must seek opportunities
whereby the discourse of the dominant might be undermined and contested.
To extend Sloop and Ono\'s definition, out-law discourses are those that
can (and, by their analysis, do) take advantage of situations (e.g.,
race riots) to disrupt the regularity of dominant cultural groups.

The ongoing struggle between strategically instituted cultural dominants
and the \"out-law always lurk\[ing\] in the distance\" (66) is
acknowledged, even celebrated, by Sloop and Ono. What their
acknowledgment fails to provide, however, is a clear need for critical
intervention. Indeed, quite the reverse is presented: It is the critic
(particularly the left-leaning critic) who needs out-law discourse.
While the struggles over justice, equality, and freedom have gone on,
the left-leaning critics are those who have theoretically excluded
themselves from the disputes. The study of out-law dis- courses, then,
provides a means to reinvigorate the intellectual and re-institute
(academic) leftist thinking into popular political struggles (53-54).
Thus, Sloop and Ono\'s project incorporates three types of rhetoric: the
rhetoric of the in-law, presumably the traditional object of critical
attention; the rhetoric of the out-law, the study of which may transform
our understanding of judgment as well as reinvigorate leftist democratic
critiques; and the rhetoric of the critics who, having lost their
political po- tency, can exploit the discourse of the out-law to promote
ideological struggles. It is to this critical rhetoric that I now turn.

Resistance criticism

Sloop and Ono (1997) clearly state the relationship they envision
between the rhetorical critic and out-law discourse: \"Ultimately, we
will argue that the role of critical rhetoricians is to produce
\'materialist conceptions of judgment,\' using out-law judgments to
disrupt dominant logics of judgment\" (54; emphasis added). Here the
critic seeks out vernacular discourse (60), focuses on the methods and
values embodied in these communities (62), listens to and evaluates the
out-law community (62-63), and chooses appropriate discourses for the
purpose of disrupting dominant practices (63). Essentially, it is the
critic who seeks out marginalized discourses and returns them to the
center for the purpose of provoking dominant cultural groups (63).

Despite acknowledging the efficacy of out-law discourses, Sloop and Ono
assume that the critiques generated and presented by the out-law
community have only minimal effect. The irony, and indeed arrogance, of
this assumption is evident when they claim: \"There are cases, however,
when, without the prompting of academic critics, out-law discourses
serve local purposes at times and at others resonate within dominant
discourses, disrupting sedimented ways of thinking, transforming
dominant forms of judgment\" (60; emphasis added). Sloop and Ono seem to
suggest that such locally generated critiques are the exception, whereas
the political efficacy of the academic critic is the rule. This seems an
odd claim, given that the justification for their out-law discourse
project is the lack of politically viable academic critique and the
perceived potency of out-law conceptions of judgment. [[Their suggestion
that out-law communities]{.mark} are in [need]{.mark} of [the academic
critic **contradicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[the]{.mark}
already [disruptive nature]{.mark} of existing out-law
discourses]{.underline} (the grounds for using out-law discourse), but
also the impotence of contemporary critical discourse (the warrant for
studying out-law discourse).

By this I do not mean that the critiques and theories generated by
academically instituted intellectuals have not been incorporated into
subversive discourses. Just as out-law discourses inevitably mount
critiques of dominant logics, so, too, the perspectives on rhetoric and
criticism generated by academics are used in resistance movements.
Feminist critiques of patriarchy, queer theories of homophobia,
postcolonial interrogations of race have found their way into the
service of resistant groups. The key distinction I wish to make is that
the existence of criticism (academic or self-generated) in resistance
does not necessitate Sloop and Ono\'s move to a criticism of resistance.

What [Sloop and [Ono fail to offer]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[an adequate
argument for \"**taking**]{.mark} **public [speaking out of the
streets]{.mark}** [and **studying it in the classroom**]{.mark}, for
[treating it less as]{.mark} an **expression of
[protest]{.mark}**[\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wander 1983, 3)
[[and]{.mark} more [as an **object for analysis**]{.mark} and
**reproduction** [within the]{.mark} **political economy of the
[academy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Philip Wander made a similar charge
against Herbert Wicheln\'s early critical project, and this concern
should remain at the forefront of any discussion aimed at expanding the
scope and function of criticism. [Sloop and Ono offer numerous
directives for the critic [without addressing **whether the critic
should be examining**]{.mark} **out-law discourses [in the first
place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While it is too early to suggest any
definitive answer to the question of criticism of resistance, some
preliminary arguments as to why critics should not pursue out-law
discourses can be offered:

\(1\) [Hidden out-law discourses may have **good reasons to stay
hidden**]{.underline}. Sloop and Ono specifically instruct us that \"the
logic of the out-law must constantly be searched for, brought forth\"
(66) and used to disrupt dominant practices. But [[are we to
believe]{.mark} that]{.underline} all out-law discourses are prepared to
mount such a challenge to the dominant cultural logic? Or, indeed, that
the [[members]{.mark} of out-law communities [are prepared to be
**brought into the arena of**]{.mark} **public
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the service of reconstituting
logics of litigation? It seems highly unlikely that all divergent
cultural groups have developed equally, or that all members of these
groups share Sloop and Ono\'s \"imperial impulse\" (51) to promote their
conceptions and practices of justice.

\(2\) Academic critical discourse is not transparent. Here I allude to
the overall problem of translation (see Foucault 1994; Lyotard 1988;
Lyotard and Thebaud 1985; Zabus 1995) as an extension of the previous
concern. Critical discourse cannot become the medium of commensurability
for divergent language games. Are we to believe that the \"use\" of
out-law dis- course by critics to disrupt dominant practices can fail to
do violence to these diverse/divergent logics? Are out-law discourses
merely tools to be exploited and discarded in the pursuit of returning
leftist academic dis- course to the center?

\(3\) Perhaps the academic translation of out-law discourse could be
true to the internal logic of the out-law community. And,
[[perhaps]{.mark} the [re-presentation]{.mark} of out-law logic within
the academic community [will bestow]{.mark} a degree of
**[legitimacy]{.mark}** on the out-law community. [**Nonetheless**, the
effect]{.mark} of legitimizing out-law discourse [is]{.mark} unknown and
potentially **[destructive]{.mark}**. In an effort [to
**siphon**]{.mark} **the political [energy]{.mark}** of out-law
discourse [into academic practice, we]{.mark} may ultimately
**[destroy]{.mark}** the dissatisfaction that serves as [a
**cathexis**]{.mark} for these out-law discourses]{.underline}. It seems
possible that [academic [recognition]{.mark} might [**take the place**
of]{.mark} struggle for [material opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Fraser 1997). [[But, will]{.mark} academic [legitimation create
**any**]{.mark} **material [changes]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[conditions]{.mark} of out-law communities?]{.underline} I mean to
suggest, not that it is better to allow the out-law community to suffer
for its cause, but rather that incorporating the struggle into an
(admittedly) impotent academic critique does not offer a prima facie
alternative.

\(4\) Criticism of resistance denies the practical and theoretical
importance of opportunity. Returning to De Certeau\'s notion of tactics,
the crucial element of these discursive moves is their use of
opportunity to disrupt the proper authority of the dominant. The kairos
of intervention provides the key to undermining \"in-law\" discourses.
But when is the \"right moment in time\" for the academic reproduction
of out-law discourse? Mapping the points of resistance (ala Foucault and
Biesecker) entails interrogating \"in-law\" discourses for their
incongruities and contradictions, not turning the academic gaze upon
those communities waiting for an opportunity. Out-laws do not lurk in
the forefront (66), hoping to be exposed by academic critics; they wait
for the right moment for their disruption. Rhetoricians can provide
rhetorical instructions for seeking opportunities and for exploiting
these opportunities (literally making the culturally weaker argument the
stronger), but this does not justify interrogating (intervening in) the
cultural logics of the marginalized.

The concerns raised here are not designed to dismiss Sloop and Ono\'s
provocative essay. The divergent critical logic they outline deserves
careful consideration within the critical community, and it is my hope
that the concerns I raise may help to further problematize the
relationship between

resistance and rhetorical criticism.

Rhetorical criticism

As I have suggested, my purpose is to use the provocative nature of
Sloop and Ono\'s project to extend disputes regarding the ends of
rhetorical criticism. Diverging perspectives on the ends of criticism
have been categorized by Barbara Warnick (1992) as falling along four
general lines: artist, analyst, audience, and advocate. Leah Ceccarelli
(1997) discerns similar categories around the aesthetic, epistemic, and
political ends of rhetorical criticism.

The out-law discourse project presents clear ties to the notion of
critic as advocate. [For Sloop and Ono, the critic is an **interested
party**, discerning]{.underline} (and at times disputing) [the
underlying values and forces contained within a discourse. Additionally,
however, [the]{.mark} out-law discourse [critic is]{.mark} an analyst
[focusing on]{.mark} the **[hidden]{.mark}**]{.underline}, aberrant
[[texts]{.underline}]{.mark} of the out-law [[and
**\"rendering\]**]{.mark} **an incoherent or esoteric text
[comprehensible\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Warnick 1992, 233). Now, I am
not suggesting that a critic must serve only one function or that the
roles of advocate and analyst are mutually exclusive; rather, [these
entanglings of power]{.underline} (political ends) [and
knowledge]{.underline} (epistemic ends) [are inevitable]{.underline}. My
concern is that we not neglect the complexity of these entanglements.
**[[Turning covert]{.mark} out-law [discourses into objects of]{.mark}
our [analyses]{.mark} runs the [risk]{.mark} of [subjecting them]{.mark}
both [to the gaze of the dominant and]{.mark} to [the power relations of
the academy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the works of Michel Foucault
(especially 1979, 1980) aptly illustrate, practices presented as
extending such noble goals as emancipation and humanity may endow
institutions of confinement and objectification. Any justification for
studying out-law dis- course because doing so may extend our political
usefulness in the pursuit of emancipatory goals must not obscure the
already existing power relations authorizing such studies. Our attempts
to extend our domains of knowledge and expertise (authority) must not be
pursued unreflexively.

## Capitalism K

### Root Cause\-\--1NC/2NC

#### The capitalocene defines a geo-historical epoch in which the drive for capital accumulation produces the desire for cheap nature. Capitalism co-produces nature through a network of productive forces that seek to drive down the cost of production to maximize profit, which constitutes a world ecology of capital that weaponizes symbolic discourse to justify the exploitation of land and labor. Therefore, the 1AC misses the forest for the trees when identifying the ontogenesis of the Anthropocene -- We must rather contend with capital as the very condition of possibility upon which slavery and colonialism can be reproduced.

**Szepanski 24** (Achim Szepanski, radical German author and
philosopher; 6-1-24; "The Capitalocene and Fossil Capital
(Overpollution)", Capitalism in the Age of Catastrophe. Palgrave
Insights into Apocalypse Economics. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham; DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-57754-3_13) -- Langham EY

Jason W. Moore has presented an expanded and comprehensive conception of
the capitalization of nature. His thesis of the [**Capitalocene**
identifies the origins of capitalism and capitalogenic environmental
design in the revolutions of labor and landscape between 1492 and 1750.
**Capitalism became a geological** **force** in these centuries,
creating a modern constitution of biological flows throu**gh the
globalizing infrastructures of capital, empire, and class
formation.**]{.underline} For Malm, the rise of capitalism is a question
of an Anglo-centric history, shaped by the geographies of class
struggle, technical innovation, and the coal revolution. For Moore, on
the other hand, it is the epochal land and labor revolution after 1492
that produced a capitalist world ecology. Malm's description of fossil
capital is for Moore an important element of a longer history. Moore
does not agree with Malm's periodization because it does not take into
account the constitutive geohistorical relationships that preceded and
accompanied large industry after 1800: [The **intertwining of plantation
complex and transatlantic class dynamics** and their contribution to
capital formation in industrializing Britain. The **productive forces**
are understood]{.underline} by Moore [as configurations of capital,
class and technique, and are **integrated into** the **imperialist
dynamics of accumulation.**]{.underline}

Moore calls in his writings to finally overcome the philosophical
dualism that sees economy and ecology as separate areas, and instead to
focus on the relations between both areas. (Moore, 2015: 16) If one
understood that the (capitalist) relations and not the relata were
central, then one would understand, for example, how and why Wall Street
is always also a mode of organizing nature. One would finally understand
how the turbulences on the stock markets are connected with the problems
of the climate and life on this planet in a way that has not yet been
even noticed by radical left economists.

The currently highly regarded theory of the Anthropocene is for Moore a
theory that remains within the society-nature dualism. Accordingly, the
decisive economic development for humanity begins in eighteenth century
England with the steam engine and coal. Long before this, and this is to
be understood as a critique of Malm, according to Moore, at least the
potential of capital to transform the environment exists. This concerns
speed, scope, and measurement of environmental factors. Consider the
first plantations in Madeira. In addition, [**transformations in ecology
cannot be attributed to an abstract category like humanity** as the
cause. This is a deeply anthropocentric and Eurocentric view of
things.]{.underline} Therefore, Moore replaces the term "Anthropocene"
consistently with "Capitalocene". (ibid. 176) This is also supported by
the fact that capital in the period between 1700 and 2008 has increased
by a factor of 134, while in the same period the population only grew by
a factor of 10. [The dynamics of **ecological Earth transformation** in
the last three centuries **is** therefore **primarily due to capital
accumulation** and the appropriation of cheap nature by
capital.]{.underline}

For Moore, [**capitalism** is]{.underline} always more than just an
economy or a system, namely [a way of **organizing
nature.**]{.underline} He speaks of [**capitalism as a world-ecology**,
which establishes and organizes the connection between capital
accumulation, the pursuit of power, and the co-production of
nature.]{.underline} (ibid.; 161) In doing so, Moore initially opposes
the statements of René Descartes, which are still considered relevant
today. [The currently still quoted dualistic-Cartesian narrative,
according to Moore, states the following: Capitalism emerges from
nature, draws wealth from nature, and thus degrades nature. And at some
point, the catastrophe comes, nature collapses, and takes revenge on
man. This perspective on nature as a factor external to man is a
fundamental condition for the affirmation of capitalist accumulation.
**Capitalism** as a historical project **tries to code**, quantify, and
rationalize **nature**, which is understood **as external, to ensure
constant economic growth.** Nature must therefore be dominated, and this
is done by applying the laws of nature with the help of
technology.]{.underline} This view goes back to Newton.

On the other hand, Moore makes it clear from the outset that he is
concerned with a completely different conception of nature. What he
calls "Web of Life" is nature around us, as us, and in us. "Web of Life"
is the complex interplay of organic and inorganic as a permanently
changing and altering relation; it is about multilayered relations, in
which there are no antagonistic basic units (human versus nature), but
only networks in networks of relations. Worlds within worlds. (ibid.:
40, 63, 123) At this point echoes of Bruno Latour's network theory can
be found, which aims to crystallize the network dispositif as the
hegemonic mode of operation of current systems. If one understands the
network as a metanarrative, as Alexander Galloway has pointed out, one
quickly ends up with a kind of network fundamentalism ("everything is a
network"). Everything then exists in the form of a system, an ecology, a
montage, in short, as a network.

Everything that people do, for Moore, takes place in a stream of
streams, in which nature constantly surrounds and traverses man, who is
himself part of nature. Moore speaks, [to distinguish]{.underline}
himself [from the theory of the Anthropocene, of streams of power and
capital into nature, and of streams of nature into power and capital.
Instead of a "metabolic rift"]{.underline}, as Bellamy Foster writes,
[Moore speaks of a "metabolic shift".]{.underline} (Moore, 2015: 25)
Fundamentally, Moore then introduces the term "Oeikos". [This refers to
the creative, historical, and dialectical relation between humans and
extra-human natures.]{.underline} The Oeikos enables the history of
capital accumulation in the "Web of Life". [The relationship between
humans and nature is to be understood as a stream of streams; humans
internalize the entire nature and this internalizes the differences and
coherences of man.]{.underline} Moore brings into play on this general
level Marx's term "metabolism" of man with nature, a game of
ever-changing relations and interpenetrations, with which new
environments are created---environments, for Moore, are not only forests
and fields, but also factories, office towers, airports etc.

Moore is initially concerned with the destruction of dualistic thinking,
which revolves around nature and man as separate entities; he is
interested in the relations and intra-actions between culture/human and
nature, with which diverse configurations are co-produced; he speaks of
the configurations of man-in-nature, regarding organisms and
environments, regarding life and water, of land and air. Nature is not
only existent (first nature), but it is also historically present
(second nature; it includes human organizations, non-human currents,
techniques, relations, and substances---and the web of life). In this
sense, history is always one of a double internality: man-in-nature and
nature-in-human. (ibid.: 17) However, it should be added at this point
with Yuk Hui that the overcoming of the dualism of culture and nature is
always also a question of technology, which is necessary to enable a
coexistence of nature and culture. (Frey/Hui, 2023: 61) For Hui, in
order to escape the deadly destructiveness of cybernetic systems and
their inherent progress and perfectionism, a new cosmotechnics must come
into play, which brings the cosmic order and the human orders into
har9mony through techniques. (ibid.: 65) With Simondon, he notes that
technology cannot be completely subsumed by culture. Technical objects
possess their own mode of existence and specific relations to other
existences. It is, to use Karen Barad's term, intra-activities, in which
capital, humans, techniques, apparatuses, and nature are interwoven.

Moore speaks, without emphasizing technology, of a co-produced
world-ecology of capital, power, and nature. It is not just about asking
what capital does to man and nature, but also about what nature does for
capital: The formula then is
"capitalism-in-nature/nature-in-capitalism". (ibid.: 37) It is
ultimately about the question of how nature and energy are converted
into value and capital. Capitalism has not only destroyed nature in its
long phases, but also developed it through a multitude of projects,
including those that force humans (as part of nature) to work (as
oeikos), partly for free or at least for low wages. And this, Moore
predicts, would become increasingly difficult for capital in the future.

[In a time of **rapid transformation of networks**---urbanization, labor
markets, financialization---it is an important task to examine the
**flows of capital**, power, and energy, which are under the dominance
or under the grid of capital accumulation and their spatio-temporal
actualizations.]{.underline} Capital always implies the active
domination of time over space, and this in the course of accelerating
its turnover times. Each of these [accelerations]{.underline}
simultaneously [implies the **production of a new space**, which is
fixed and variable at the same time. Space is not simply out there, but
it **diffuses into social relations and forms environments**, which
always also open up possibilities for contingencies.]{.underline}
Capital, non-human flows, relations, and substances, and the web of life
are in an interpenetrating relationship.

At this point, Moore introduces the term "nature-as-matrix". (ibid.:
175) [The nature-as-matrix is the basis, condition and constituting
agent in the history of civilizations. Nature]{.underline} is thus
understood [more as a matrix than as a resource. As a
matrix]{.underline}, in and through which human activities
unfold---[nature is the field on which historical "agencies" act.
"Agencies"]{.underline}, and here again there is an echo of Latour,
[Moore]{.underline} initially [defines]{.underline} quite generally [as
relational and emergent properties between complexes of human and
non-human natures]{.underline}, whereby the latter also produce specific
configurations of human activities. [Even **the climate** is to be
**understood as a complex of determinations**, which indicate
transformations in specific historical contexts. **The climate is a
historical vector**]{.underline}, one that is to be located within the
"oeikos". Thus, [the **co-production of nature**, the pursuit of power
**and capital accumulation** are by no means to be understood as
independent blocks, whose relations might only be **held together by
feedback mechanisms.**]{.underline} Rather, these three blocks
interpenetrate in various relations and thus shape a specific historical
capitalism. Moore thus implicitly recurs again and again to the
Actor-Network Theory of Latour, according to which there can be no
objects that are not in relation to each other.5

For Moore, [**nature can neither be destroyed nor saved**, but **only
transformed** or reconfigured]{.underline}, that is, [nature is not a
static field, but it renews itself in cycles and changes
cumulatively.]{.underline} Historical natures are both producers and
products of capitalist development. Moore distinguishes between "nature
in general" and "historical nature". While nature in general has been
inevitably there for billions of years, [the **capitalist historical
nature** is defined by the law of cheap nature and **reproduced by the
capitalist revolutionizing of nature** and the parallel sequence of
historical natures.]{.underline}

Moore differentiates two simultaneous relations and processes: On the
one hand, the economic relations between capital and labor produce the
socially necessary abstract labor time as a result of the extraction of
surplus value, and on the other hand, the relations of the partly
violent appropriation of cheap nature produce the abstract social
nature. This refers to the processes by which capital and states map,
code, quantify, and measure the human and extra-human nature for the
purposes of capital accumulation. (ibid.:)

Moore rightly distinguishes here between capital as project/logic and
capitalism as historical world ecology, the latter understood as a
history of capital, power, and nature shaped according to a specific
pattern---an (open) totality, in and with which, however, many
determinations operate. As we have depicted in Capitalization Vol. 1 it
is necessary to make a conceptual distinction between capital and
capitalism. (Szepanski 2014a, 2014b) Capitalism is to be understood as
a---under economic, political, and cultural aspects---quite
heterogeneous historical formation, a world ecology of capital, power,
and (re)production in the web of nature, but essentially determined by
the production and circulation logics of capital. In capitalism, besides
the dominant mode of production of capital, one also finds
non-capital-determined modes of production, be they neo-feudal,
slum-like, corrupt, and criminal economies, but also cooperative
economies, which are only partially or not at all linked to capital. We
consider capital as a conceptual logic or as a differential system,
whose production and circulation cycles follow a specific immanent
lawfulness that keeps the system in balance, as it also makes it
crisis-prone. Capital and its own method of capitalization function, so
to speak, as the engine (which cannot be separated from a relation) of
the formation "capital-ism", in which the economy ultimately determines
all other areas such as politics, culture, art, science etc.

For Moore, [the **law of value** within the framework of capital logic
is a **gravitational field** that **exerts a lasting influence on the
capitalist world ecology** over long patterns, but also allows
significant contingencies.]{.underline} Anwar Shaikh speaks in his book
Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises similarly speaks of
order-in-and-through-disorder, a systemic mode of turbulent regulation,
which takes the form of repetition occurring according to certain
patterns. A wide range of phenomena, according to Shaikh, can ultimately
be explained by a small set of operating principles that ensure that
current events revolve around the centers of gravity. (Shaikh, 2016:
55ff.) This type of eventfulness, Moore notes again, cannot be
understood as an economic phenomenon alone, but must be understood as a
systemic problem with crucial economic and ecological moments.

For Moore, [the capitalization or the **capital accumulation** always
also **relies on the appropriation of unpaid labor** outside of capital
circulation, an appropriation that remains within the reach of
capitalist power and logic.]{.underline} (Moore, 2015: 177) [The limits
and configurations of **cheap nature** are therefore also actively
**produced by symbolic practices and material transformations that fall
within the power domain of capital.**]{.underline} Thus, [the
capitalization of everything and everyone not only requires the constant
revolutionizing of the productive forces]{.underline} (within the
capitalist mode of production and in relation to the relations of
production), [but also **the reproduction of capitalism as
world-ecology**, and the latter **cuts between the boundaries of paid
and unpaid labor and human and non-human resources.**]{.underline}

[Capital requires the production of cheap nature]{.underline}, the four
"cheaps": cheap food, cheap energy, cheap labor, and cheap raw
materials. (ibid.: 188ff.) [**Cheap nature** is then **produced**
**when** "agencies" such as **capital, the sciences, and the empire
succeed in releasing cheap sources in and from nature for capital
production**, cheap also in the historical sense, insofar as the four
cheap "cheaps" contribute to reducing the socially necessary abstract
labor time.]{.underline} The concept of appropriation in Moore refers to
such extra-economic processes that apply unpaid or cheap labor outside
of the capital system and channel it into capital circulation. (ibid.:
64) [**The appropriation of unpaid** or cheap **labor increases the
general rate of profit** and thus appropriation is also to be understood
as a productive activity.]{.underline} It not only provides raw
materials, but it co-determines the socially necessary societal labor
time. If abstract labor concerns the capital-wage labor relation,
through which surplus value is produced, then social nature denotes the
relation capital-cheap/unpaid labor, through which an increasing
productivity for capital over longer periods of time becomes possible at
all. At this point, Moore's substantialist reading of the value theory,
which is based on the basis of the "substance" of labor time, becomes
apparent again when he mentions abstract labor.6 The interpretation of
labor as substance7 and as the exclusive source of surplus value
complicates the examination of important phenomena of the contemporary
global economy such as intangible assets, financial markets, and the
biophysical limits of capitalism. More interesting in Moore is the
concept of appropriation. It channels human and non-human sources of
unpaid labor/energy towards capital circulation, without necessarily
having to capitalize the sources. [**If capital can appropriate large
amounts of unpaid labor**/energy, the costs of production definitely
decrease. In these times, there is a high world-ecological surplus,
whereas the ecological surplus is the rate between the mass of capital
and the appropriated mass of unpaid labor/energy.]{.underline}

The appropriation of cheap resources, but also of cheap waste, does not
produce capital, but the spaces, relations, and energies that first made
it possible for capital accumulation to take place so extensively over
long historical periods. Moore simply asserts that for the stabilization
of the capital relationship, the appropriation of cheap nature is of
even greater importance than capitalization. However, this is doubtful.

**[The dialectic of productivity and plunder]{.underline}**---the
accumulation through capitalization and the accumulation through
appropriation---[**has allowed** **capitalism** to survive to this day,
thus being able **to reproduce itself over six centuries.**]{.underline}
Moore tries to justify this with Marxist categories. When the technical
composition of capital increases, the organic composition of capital
usually also increases over longer periods, except, according to Moore,
under the conditions of a rapid appropriation of cheap nature. (ibid.)
Moore goes so far as to see the level or fall of the organic composition
of capital decisively constituted by the production of cheap nature
(even the cheapening of constant capital can lead to such a fall). The
technical composition of capital can therefore, as is the case in
capitalism, increase while the organic composition of capital decreases,
in Moore's case due to the appropriation of cheap nature, and
counteracts the fall in the rate of profit. However, there are a number
of factors that Moore leaves unmentioned.

[Constant capital can be divided into fixed]{.underline}
([machines]{.underline}) [and circulating constant capital]{.underline}
([raw materials]{.underline}). The latter is again to be distinguished
from the circulation of capital. In this context, Moore speaks of
under-production; [capital is constantly trying to reduce the value
share of raw materials or circulating capital in relation to machines
and buildings]{.underline} (fixed capital), [even if]{.underline}
(pushed by increasing productivity) [the material throughput of raw
materials in production increases. This is done through the
appropriation of cheap raw materials.]{.underline} If one places more
weight on the development of circulating capital than on fixed capital,
this also has implications for the law of the falling rate of profit.
The appropriation of cheap nature counteracts the fall in the rate of
profit. The rate of profit is inversely proportional to the value of raw
materials. The overproduction of fixed capital finds its counterpart in
the underproduction of circulating constant capital, or to put it
another way, [**capital** tries to lower the price of raw materials
relative to fixed capital while simultaneously increasing the physical
throughput of raw materials]{.underline} ([which in turn **drives global
warming**]{.underline}). Malm also mentions this latter point, but
without referring to the cheap four "cheaps". [In order to increase its
own profitability and to beat other companies, a company must not only
invest in machines, but also increase labor productivity and intensity
with each step. Increased labor productivity also means increased
material throughput of raw materials per unit of working time.
**Production** is therefore directly **linked to** the systems of
forestry, energy, **mining**, and agriculture.]{.underline} In addition,
[the cheap appropriation of raw materials and energy can not only lower
the prices for circulating, but also for fixed capital. **Cheap metals
also lower the prices of machines.**]{.underline}

If one considers technology in the context of the rate of profit,
[technically better machines, the increase in organizational efficiency,
the influence of communication, information, and logistics lead to an
increased output of goods and the rate of profit rises. It also
increases if wages rise slower than productivity.]{.underline} This was
the case in Fordism, while it can also lead to a temporary increase in
the rate of profit with a slow increase in wages and a slow increase in
productivity, as is sometimes the case in neoliberalism. But even in the
analysis of early capitalism, Moore sees further additions as necessary.
[**In the mines**, textile production, and agriculture, **new
techniques** and the processes **of making nature usable lead to an
increase in labor productivity.** In early capitalism, technical
innovation, systemic violence, and symbolic innovation were mobilized in
projects to both extend the working day, increase the intensity of work,
and produce and appropriate cheap nature.]{.underline} Polish grain,
**[slaves]{.underline}**, and the Norwegian forests, the appropriation
of natural fertility **[functioned for capital like an increase in the
production of relative surplus value.]{.underline}** (ibid.: 99) [There
are historical--geographical connections between the increase in labor
productivity and the necessary conditions for the reproduction of
capital, which]{.underline} for Moore [are unimaginable without the
appropriation of cheap nature.]{.underline} And these conditions depend
on the massive addition of unpaid or cheap labor outside the capital
system and wage labor. Appropriated nature itself becomes a productive
force. However, the inner logic of capital accumulation deteriorates
over time those conditions of production that allow it to provide cheap
input for the same. Therefore, new boundaries of appropriation must
always be found and overcome in order to set long waves of accumulation
in motion. Technological progress, the power of capital, and the
sciences open up the possibility for new appropriation surges.

[Appropriation deals with how capital can reduce the basic external
costs of its production. **World-ecological revolutions provide an
increasing ecological surplus** which represents the gap between the
appropriated and the capitalized natures in the end. **An ecological
revolution takes place precisely when the innovations of capital, the
sciences, and the empire enforce a new unity of abstract labor, social
nature, and primitive accumulation.**]{.underline} Moore refers to this
unity as a "world-ecological regime". [Technological and organizational
innovations allow increasing productivity, while the mapping,
quantification, and discovery of new historical natures allow an
increasing appropriation of unpaid labor and energy]{.underline}
(supported by new imperialisms and land grabs, agro-industrial and
scientific revolutions, unpaid labor, soil fertility etc.) Thus,
[capital constantly asks for labor that is required to make the free
resources of nature usable.]{.underline}

#### Post-humanist critique remains rooted in the episteme and can't fuel resistance. Concrete action that resists capitalist logics is necessary for true material change.

[[Post-humanism]{.underline}]{.mark} highlights how humans are not only
subjects who think but also objects that are thought. It thus [[aims to
destabilise]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [subject--object]{.mark}
[binary]{.mark}]{.underline} that so strongly affects the ways we
undertake philosophical inquiry [and [to elucidate]{.mark}]{.underline}
instead [[the materiality]{.underline}]{.mark} (vis-à-vis transcendence)
[[of]{.mark} human [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in the
context where science discovers anew the material plasticity of the
human, from its genetic composition to cerebral function. Cary Wolfe,
for example, argues how the human is a 'prosthetic creature that has
coevolved with various forms of technicity and materiality'; a being
that is defined not by transcendence or pre-eminence but by
'constitutive dependency and finitude'.10 Wolfe indeed explains, by
means of Derrida, that 'mortality' is what 'resides as the most radical
means of thinking the finitude that we share with animals'; the
precarity of all lives, put another way, is the basis for the
'experience of compassion'.11 But finitude is not only limited to
mortality, as it can also refer to an *a priori* condition that one is
born into, such as human systems of communication. According to Wolfe,
the utterance of the 'I' does not lead to the experience of selfhood but
to that of subjection to the *a priori* nature of the semiotic system,
or to 'a radically ahuman technicity or mechanicity of language'.12
Uttering a word, therefore, does not authorise the speaking subject but
submits the subject to the extraneous, foreign arrangement that is
language.

For Wolfe, then, there is the falsity of 'the notion of the human that
it "gives to itself"'.13 This means that subjects -- or what he calls
'first-order observers' (borrowing from the terminology of systems
theory) -- are not so transcendent as to be able to 'reflect on their
latencies and blind spots while at the same time deploying them'.14 That
can only be done by 'another observer', not necessarily even a human
one, for the very limited 'conditions of cognition and communication'
necessitate the presence of the Other.15 The human mind is therefore
incapable of thinking at its own behest, independently of the Other.

Leaving aside the point that this is a re-iteration of the
poststructuralist position, [there is the problem of how the very
necessity of ethics and politics is erased]{.underline} in Wolfe's
arguments. Wolfe is indeed right to highlight how the human is always
dependent on and indebted to the presence of the Other, but his push to
the utmost passivity leads him to argue, for example, that the human
partakes in considering the 'alterity of the other' not by 'benevolent
reflection but by the very \... conditions that, in their constitutive
"blindness," generate the *necessity* of the other'.16 According to this
argument, we are already ethical because we constitutively necessitate
the Other and are Otherised. One need not accommodate, negotiate, or
persuade -- one needs merely to contemplate the passivity that is
structured into her very relationship to the world, which of its own
nature brings her to acknowledge the Other's alterity.

Arguing that this [[post-humanism is]{.mark} too [negative]{.mark}
[because]{.mark} [it is rooted in]{.mark} ideas of [finitude and
vulnerability]{.mark} [that]{.mark} '[fuel]{.mark} [an]{.mark}
[affective economy of loss and melancholia]{.mark} at the heart of the
subject',17 Rosi Braidotti offers a more 'affirmative brand of posthuman
thought',18 one that does not make all species' conditions evenly and
universally vulnerable.]{.underline} Resisting what she regards as the
[element of [necro-politics]{.underline}]{.mark} [or *Thanatos* in many
post-humanist discourses, Braidotti replaces Wolfe's ontological
finitude and passivity with the affirmative condition of being embedded,
embodied, and relational in the forcefield of Life.19 That is, humans
are part of the 'non-human, vital force of Life' or 'zoe' wherein they
[recognise that human life is a 'process, interactive and
open-ended']{.mark}, not some 'exclusive property or the unalienable
right'.20 Radically open and mutable by nature, post-human subjectivity
ideally is post-nationalist, with a 'panhuman cosmopolitan bond',
'becoming-minoritarian', and 'becoming-nomad of Europe'.21]{.underline}

Few would disagree with Braidotti's catholic vision, or with her
insistence that we recognise the specific material situatedness of each
subject position. Yet, Braidotti's theoretical anchoring onto what she
terms a Spinozist 'monistic philosophy of becomings' leads one to wonder
whether her sensitivity to such politics of locations and identities
carry any weight in the end, for by positing that matter is 'intelligent
and self-organizing' she also reasons that 'matter is not dialectically
opposed to culture, nor to technological mediation, but continuous with
them'.22 Subjectivity, also a kind of matter, is thus a 'process of
auto-poiesis or self-styling' that involves complex and continuous
negotiations with dominant norms and values'.23 This means for Braidotti
that subjectivity 'need not be critical in the negative sense of
oppositional and thus may not be aimed \... at the production of
counter-subjectivities'.24 [[Her]{.mark} [monism]{.mark}, in other
words, which she argues is now corroborated 'by an updated scientific
understanding of self-organizing \... matter',25 [obviates the need for
negative oppositions, confrontations, and refusals, because]{.mark} in
matter [unity]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [already]{.mark} [achieved]{.mark}.
[Politics]{.mark} then [becomes]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [question]{.mark} [of
letting the]{.mark} [immanent]{.mark}, [autopoietic]{.mark},
self-styling [principles unfold]{.mark}; [the fact that humans
risk]{.mark} [their lives]{.mark} [for]{.mark} their [political]{.mark}
and religious [beliefs]{.mark}, for example, somehow [loses]{.mark} its
[ideological stakes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [gravity]{.mark}
[within]{.mark} this monistic [worldview]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Braidotti's affirmative [post-humanism]{.underline} also leads her to
[see current events a little too conveniently and sanguinely, such
as]{.underline} when she suggests that the 'commodification of Life' in
fact is an opportunity to propel the post-anthropocentric turn and
initiate a more creative subject-formation,26 or when she states that a
'more egalitarian road, in a *zoe*-centred way, requires a modicum of
goodwill on the part of the dominant party \... although this is asking
a lot'.27 Because she denies that there are 'counter-subjectivities',
Braidotti can only hope contingency will do its benign work. Not only
that, she ends up allowing more agency and leverage to the dominant
party.

At first glance, there is a big difference between the two approaches
outlined by Wolfe and Braidotti, as one bases itself on the ontological
finitude of all beings and the other on ontological openness. I want to
focus more on their possible points of convergence, however, for present
in both is [[the]{.mark} [reduction of the social that entails civic
engagement,]{.mark} cultural (and [countercultural]{.mark})
[life]{.mark}, and [political]{.mark} [endeavours]{.mark}]{.underline}.
To varying degrees of intensity, [[they focus more]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} [the effects and functions of [systems,
autopoiesis]{.mark}, and [zōḗ]{.mark}, [than they do on humans]{.mark}
[within]{.mark} social [institutions]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[polities]{.mark} (democratic or otherwise). [Post-humanism]{.mark}'s
intention is to highlight the inseparability -- or perhaps the
always-already meshed realms of the natural and the cultural -- but it
[ends up shelving]{.mark} [the]{.mark} political [dimension]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [human]{.mark} [life]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the
[partisan]{.mark}, the [parliamentary]{.mark}, the [civil]{.mark}, [as
well as what erupts on the street]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Discursivity of Post-humanism

[Post-humanism's erasure of the political highlights yet another
problem, which is that it is predominantly discursive.]{.underline} That
is, [it focuses more on scrutinising how the human can be theoretically
undone or be succeeded by a new theory than on resolving the material
and practical challenges posed by and for the human.]{.underline} Once
extrapolated onto the social terrain, [[post-humanist
argument]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[loses]{.mark} [its]{.mark} radical
[appearance]{.mark} [to become a theory without political
enactment]{.mark}. The [issues]{.mark} [central]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[post-humanists]{.mark} include how humanism reinforces human
exceptionalism and aggravates human domination of nature, all of which
in fact [can only be undone by human praxis in recognition of a common
social vision]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Because they minimise or even
obliterate human agency]{.underline}, however, [they render their goal
politically unviable.]{.underline} They see history as the effects of
non-causative events without human agents, and as mere functions of
inexplicable affects and forces. In this sense, it is worth considering
that where [post-humanist thinking]{.underline} is frequently evoked,
for example, in the field of animal studies, it [merely repeats
discursive analyses by commenting on how anthropocentric the humanist
tradition is. [For post-humanists,]{.mark}]{.underline} although [[legal
amendments and activism]{.underline}]{.mark} are indispensable, they
[[remain insufficient because they still operate within humanist
frameworks]{.mark}. Thus, it transports itself to the realm of the
affect where a rapport with the nonhuman takes place in an extra-legal,
pre-social, and intuitive space that shelves the material determinants
that shape human--animal relationships.]{.underline}
[[Humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, although not without
some significant limitations, [[can find realisation
in]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[socio-political
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} as animal-rights and animal-liberation
movements. Humanism has this capacity [[because it envisages
humans]{.mark} [as agents of change]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
in [some romantic way]{.mark} that elevates humans into those who redeem
animals, but as agents who compromise, negotiate, and
oppose]{.underline}.

[[Post-humanism is thus effective]{.mark} insofar [as it makes attempts
at a poetic and stylistic retort against the anthropocentric
epistemologies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- the emergence of the field of
bio-art is telling in its aesthetic rendering of biological matter,
presenting nature as the object of the sublime on a petri dish while
bracketing off social and historical processes. Abstracted from a
sociohistorical context, [[post-humanism]{.mark} in this sense is a
theory that [is merely performative]{.mark} [without]{.mark} concrete
[action]{.mark}: it [covers]{.mark} [up]{.mark} the [messy]{.mark}
[terrain]{.mark} where problems ranging from de-humanisation to
animalisation to mechanisation occur -- [all of which are aggravated and
reinforced by capitalist logic]{.mark} -- by coining a new term
(post-humanism), creating a new reality (post-humanity), and assuming
that it is (always) already here]{.underline}. Not only that,
post-humanism shows itself to be essentialising when it claims that
humans have always-already been post-human, neglecting different
conditions of existence and the uneven ways in which humanity develops.
[One could argue that to be a post-humanist on these theoretical levels
may not be the same as denying humans the capacity to politically
mobilise -- that is to say, one can be a post-humanist and a
revolutionary at the same time. But to argue thus would be to have it
both ways, an untenable position that only highlights its contradiction,
which devalues human agency while also reverting right back to
it.]{.underline}

[Towards [the reappropriation of humanism]{.mark}]{.underline} The
preceding discussion has focused on the specifics of the critical
discourse on humanism that has come to dominate social theory over the
past half-century or so. Particular attention has been given to the
problematic and aporetic aspects of that discourse -- aspects that are
related to the particular configuration of the anti-foundationalist,
anti-subjectivist and anti-anthropological underpinnings of the
critiques contained therein. [The commonest manifestation of these
problematic and aporetic aspects]{.underline} [is]{.underline}, as has
been suggested, [[a more-or-less flattened account of individual]{.mark}
and social [life]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [the result of [an explicit
attempt to methodologically deny]{.mark} what might be called [the
'analytical correlates of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[humanism]{.mark}']{.underline} (Durkin, 2014, pp. 127, 211) -- [that
is, a focus on the human, the self, the subject, history and so
on]{.underline}. [The relatively flattened accounts of social life that
elicit from the [anti-humanist thinkers]{.mark} discussed are
characterised]{.underline} [by **[a]{.mark} notable [lack of engagement
with the affective]{.mark}** and other lived qualities of that
life]{.underline} -- [[qualities]{.mark} which, [though]{.mark} formally
[renounced, **nevertheless tend to reappear**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in
denuded and somewhat unmoored fashion]{.underline}. [The formal
anti-anthropologism that characterises these accounts]{.underline}, and
that [is seen as safeguarding against humanist excesses]{.underline} of
ethnocentrism and other forms of misplaced certainty, [belies a tendency
towards a shallow and implicit anthropology]{.underline} that appears in
spite of its formal preclusion.6 In as much as this is so[**, [the
reappearance of humanist]{.mark} analytical [traits]{.mark}**, where
this occurs, merely heightens the stripped-back nature of the discussion
of real, lived life at hand]{.underline}. Moreover, [the shallow
anthropology that appears often does so in terms of its negative
framing]{.underline}: [that is to say, in terms of what humanity is not
as opposed to what it is, of how human individuals and groups are
constituted as opposed to what they constitute or how they constitute it
and so on]{.underline}. [The fact that **[there are political
consequences]{.mark}** that have issued from this focus should not be
surprising]{.underline}. Although it will be said that we cannot claim
essential connections between an underlying philosophical standpoint and
putative political position, the fact is that political directives
regularly issue from, and certainly are associated with, such
standpoints. This is, of course, a contextual matter, but [the striking
naivete -- where not outright complicity -- that has characterised the
politics of many of the thinkers discussed herein is hard to ignore, as
is the fact that this naivete stems, at least in part, from the idealist
and theoreticist tendencies that have gone side-by-side with the
suppression of humanist tropes as connected to real lived
life]{.underline}. [The second narrative thread]{.underline} in the
foregoing discussion concerns [the intimately connected issue of **[the
impoverished understanding of humanism]{.mark}** itself **that
[predominates]{.mark}** in **[the anti-humanist
tradition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What is readily apparent in the
critical discourse under discussion here is [[the routine reduction of
humanism to Cartesianism]{.mark} plain and simple]{.underline}: that is,
[to [a naive philosophy of the subject]{.mark} and to an inescapably
ethnocentric and restrictive philosophical anthropology that tends to go
with it.]{.underline} As already noted, [this reduction takes place
despite the reappearance, in denuded and mystified form, of many of the
humanist themes associated with these positions]{.underline}. But what
is most important here is the lack of any kind detailed analysis of
instances of humanism itself. **[Humanism [tends to function in these
accounts as]{.mark} merely [an empty signifier]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
[[a caricature]{.mark} abstracted from historical context and stripped
of all diversity and nuance]{.underline}. In this sense, we can say that
[the idealism that marks the substantive analyses characteristic within
the paradigm arranged around the anti-humanist thematic is magnified
when it comes to the issue of humanism]{.underline}. Foucault
constitutes a case in point. Despite what is a more extended textual
engagement in works such as The Order of Things, [Foucault's highly
reductive reading of humanism]{.underline} in What is Enlightenment? --
as separated from and opposed to what he takes to be the Enlightenment
ethos of 'critique' [-- exemplifies the ideological nature of the
critical discourse on humanism]{.underline}. [In defining humanism not
as a practice]{.underline} (in his earlier writings it certainly was,
albeit a repressive practice concerned with the extension of
'disciplinary mechanisms') but merely as a set of themes concerned with
justifying anterior anthropological concerns, [Foucault **[ignores
the]{.mark} practically and ideologically [emancipatory role that
humanism has played]{.mark} [in liberatory struggles]{.mark} [at
numerous points in history]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Certainly, Foucault
does refer to the tradition of Marxist humanism, for instance, but [he
offers nothing in the way of a serious analysis of that tradition, not
to mention the feminist or anti-colonial traditions of
humanism]{.underline}. [[Humanism is simply written
off]{.underline}]{.mark} as something that is incapable of the kind of
self-reflexive form of criticality that Foucault valorises. [From an
even cursory look at these traditions, however, it is clear that
humanism can also be a form of critical practice.]{.underline} Had
Foucault paid greater heed to Merleau-Ponty, for instance, he would have
heard humanism defined as precisely the interrogative ethos that he
claims for his own position: one concerned with 'what is problematic in
our own existence and in that of the world, to such a point that we
shall never be cured of searching for a solution' (Merleau-Ponty, 1963,
p. 44). [[The Marxist humanist tradition]{.mark} in general]{.underline}
-- and thinkers such as [Raya Dunayevksaya, Erich Fromm, Frantz Fanon,
Aim´e C´esaire]{.underline} -- [[combines **a concern for
liberation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [(not merely 'resistance') [with
a]{.mark} similarly [reflexive, critical relationship to **the
historical constitution of real live human
beings**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are different valences of
criticality here and varying levels of engagement with philosophical
anthropology and other aspects associated with classical humanism; but
what is central to all is (a) [a stress on the critical role that
humanism can offer in [its appeal to realising a different
future]{.mark} and (b) [the stress on human agency]{.mark} [as the
basis]{.mark} upon which [that different future might be
realised]{.mark}]{.underline}. In each instance, [the politics that
issues from the constitutive humanism in question is grounded in the
real lived life of individuals and groups, in practical movements of
various stripes that fought against,]{.underline} for instance,
[fascism]{.underline}, Stalinism, [colonialism, patriarchy and of course
capitalism]{.underline}. But if there can be a bourgeois, not to mention
a colonial humanism, as well as a Marxist, feminist or anti-colonial
humanism, might not Foucault be right when he claims (Foucault, 1984, p.
44) that 'the humanist thematic is in itself too supple, too diverse,
too inconsistent to serve as an axis for reflection'? [What certainly is
true is that the term -- as with any other term -- has undergone a
series of modulations of meaning as it has been applied to disparate
situation in different times and places]{.underline}. [Such
[pliability]{.mark}]{.underline} (or mutability) [[does not]{.mark}
necessarily [undermine the functionality of the
term]{.mark}]{.underline} ([the same can be said of terms such as
'feminism', 'socialism', 'communism' etc.; all terms that carry critical
force today]{.underline}). [The mutability of the term merely serves to
underline its enduring serviceability and appeal]{.underline}. What
matters is that we are alive to instances in which certain types of
'humanism' violate their immanent principles.7 That there is a need to
be able to make such discernments speaks to the nature of social life
and its shifting parameters, as well as to the ceaseless struggles and
engagements contained therein. The issue of discerning between different
types of humanism has arisen in more recent discussions of humanism,
such as Halliwell and Mousley's (2003) account of various types of what
they term 'critical humanism'. But while such a focus on criticality in
relation to humanism is welcome, and while their listing of no less than
eight categories of humanism -- romantic, existential, dialogic, civic,
spiritual, pagan, pragmatic and technological -- underlines the need to
be able to differentiate between different types of humanism,
Halliwell's and Mousley's approach comes close to valorising Foucault's
concerns over the nebulousness of the concept. To include, as they do,
thinkers such as Nietzsche, Bakhtin, Bataille, Rorty, Foucault,
Baudrillard and Haraway (this list is not exhaustive) under the humanist
banner brings with it a degree of conceptual confusion that seems
undesirable: **[[humanism]{.mark} here [threatens to become everything
and nothing all at once]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Which brings us back to
the relationship between humanism and anti-humanism]{.underline}. It is
certainly accurate to say, as Halliwell and Mousley do, that humanism
and antihumanism are 'locked in a continuing dialectic' (Halliwell &
Mousley, 2003, p. 162), but we also need to [be wary of stretching the
labels so much that we elide the consequential differences --
substantive and otherwise -- that exist between them]{.underline}.8
[**[The essence of dialectics is]{.mark}**, of course, partly the
realisation that everything is interrelated]{.underline}, but [it is
also -- and more **[importantly]{.mark}** -- that **[things do not stay
the same]{.mark}**: they move, they change, they interact and oppose and
they become something qualitatively new in relation to other
things]{.underline}. As with all dialectics, [the dialectic between
humanism and anti-humanism cannot be conceived outside of the relations
that prefigure and impel upon it, as well as those that are produced by
it (the history of the twentieth century -- fascism, Bolshevism, two
World Wars, anti-colonial struggle -- and the intellectual and practical
reaction to these events and their aftermath by figures in the
respective 'camps' is implicated here;]{.underline} a fuller discussion
of these differences is, however, beyond the scope of the present
discussion). What can be said is that, while we must be careful not to
create an absolute dualism between humanism and anti-humanism, it is
also the case that there are important differences -- historical and
substantive -- between the respective traditions that must not be
obscured. I[n the case of humanism, what is integral is [a determined
focus on the human]{.mark}, the subject, the self and on history [as
a]{.mark} [meaningful arena]{.mark} [for]{.mark} agentic [social
change]{.mark} and transformation]{.underline}. There are, of course,
other modalities that connect with these concerns -- such as a focus on
human self-development, human dignity and so on. None of these concerns
are the exclusive focus of humanism (and a focus on them does not
preclude an analysis of their wider conditions of existence -- their
constitution, and their limits, both spatial and temporal), but [they
remain the necessary grounds of a humanist engagement with the
world]{.underline}. Importantly, these concerns (particularly those
relating to the former set) are precisely the characteristics challenged
by anti-humanist positions. To the extent that aspects of this challenge
have proven progressive -- and of course there are a number of senses in
which this is clearly case -- then naive forms of humanism (which is to
say those that can be found guilty on voluntarist, andro- or
ethno-centric grounds) are even less tenable today than they were in the
past. To say this is not to suggest that the articulation of humanist
programmes and positions in the present is without issue --
[ethnocentrism]{.underline}, particularly in its European form,
[continues to be the greatest practical and theoretical obstacle to a
true humanism]{.underline} -- [but these issues have always been much
reduced and, in fact, actively challenged in the critical and radical
traditions]{.underline} [of humanism]{.underline}, [particularly in
Marxist, feminist and anti-colonial humanism]{.underline}.9 What we
need, then, is the genuine sublation (Aufhebung) of the anti-humanism of
the critical discourse on humanism from the point of view of these
critical and radical humanisms. It is here, precisely in this sublation
(in thought and in practice) that progress beyond our current
state-of-affairs will surely begin.

### Link\-\--Decolonial

#### Decolonial epistemologies [naively]{.underline} assume that epistemologies can be decolonized without [material structures]{.underline} changing---that [obscures]{.underline} political economy and [facilitates]{.underline} capital expansion.

**Kapoor, 24**---professor of Critical Development Studies at the
Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University (Ilan,
"Intersectionality, Decoloniality, Indigenous Localism: A Critique,"
Theory, Culture & Society, OnlineFirst, doi:10.1177/02632764241303689,
dml)

There is much to learn from decoloniality -- from its multi-dimensional
analysis of coloniality, to its [[critique of Western modernity]{.mark}
and its]{.underline} prescriptions for decolonizing the colonial matrix.
But Mignolo's [analysis [inclines toward **romanticizing** decolonial
spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has almost nothing critical to say about
the subaltern/Global South; it is [as though they are **somehow immune**
to contradiction]{.underline}, [failure]{.underline}, [or
disagreement]{.underline} (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 96--9).

[This is evident in]{.underline} Mignolo's reliance on
[**[simplified]{.mark}** and **intransigent [binaries]{.mark}** such
as]{.underline} when he pits **[Western]{.underline}** 'imperial'
[universalism against **decolonial** pluriversality]{.underline}, which
for him is invariably 'convivial, dialogical, or plurilogical . . .
decolonial and communal personalities are driven by the search for love,
conviviality, and harmony' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv; see also Mignolo,
2011: 313). It is also evident in the work of the
Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality [research]{.underline} programme, a
collective Latin America-focused research project of
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} both Mignolo and Arturo Escobar are part.
The project [[prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[non-Eurocentric]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[forms]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}/knowledge rooted in such communities as the
Zapatistas in Mexico, Indigenous groups in Ecuador and Bolivia, and
Afro-Latinx movements in Colombia (Asher, 2013: 838; see also Escobar,
2020: 84--96, 120--35; Mignolo, 2011: 11, 213--51). Yet when Mignolo
applauds, for example, the Zapatistas for their participatory politics
and collective consensus-making, he appears to ignore that
consensus-based politics can coerce single decisions on communities,
often suppressing subaltern voices (Kapoor, 2008: 107--8, 2020: 147--69;
see Rancière, 1999). When Mignolo praises Indigenous communities, he
**[[ignores]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, [the [**cooptation**
of Indigenous leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} by the Ecuadorean state, the
Morales regime's [[**backtracking** on]{.mark} commitments to
[Indigenous self-determination]{.mark} to appease capitalist
extraction]{.underline}, [**[ideological divisions]{.mark}** between and
among Indigenous groups]{.underline} across North, South, and Central
America, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the anti-Muslim politics of sections
of adivasi (Aboriginal) communities in India in [[**collaboration** with
right-wing]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu
[[supremacists]{.underline}]{.mark}: 'What is **[absent]{.underline}**
in Mignolo's representations of the subaltern [are]{.underline} the
[warnings]{.underline} by the likes of Freire and Fanon [about the
possibility of internalized subaltern oppression]{.underline},
[racism]{.underline}, [and co-optation]{.underline} (which is ironic,
given that Fanon is one of Mignolo's key decolonial exemplars)' (Kapoor
and Zalloua, 2022: 96; see also Baviskar, 2007; Merino, 2016).

The extent of such an indiscriminate politics of
authenticity/romanticization is to be gleaned in Mignolo's recent
endorsement of a book from a right-wing Hindu author (Deepak, 2021) who
deploys decolonial arguments to make the case for a return to a Hindu
(Brahmanical) epistemology. After a public outcry, Mignolo eventually
withdrew his endorsement,8 but his [[willingness to **uncritically
embrace** a]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu nationalist [[politics]{.mark}
just [because it is **disparaging of Western
epistemology**]{.mark}]{.underline} and aims at retrieving an
'Indigenous' Hindu cosmology [is revealing of the decolonial tendency to
embrace putatively]{.underline} '**[authentic]{.underline}**' [Global
South spaces even if they are **elitist** or
**oppressive**]{.underline}.

What is conspicuously missing in Mignolo's decolonial position is the
dimension of the Real, the imminent blockage that prevents any
discursive formation -- whether capitalist, post-capitalist, or
pluriversal -- from actualizing its identity. As Crenshaw does with
intersectional identity, Mignolo appears to so revel in the jouissance
of the subaltern/Global South space that he is blind to -- disavows --
social contradictions. Hence his resort to an authentic pluriversality
devoid of imperfections: a space where, as Michaelsen and Shershow
(2007) underline in their analysis of his work (p. 53), there is de
facto consensus and agreement, indeed not even the need to criticize,
debate, or deliberate. [This [appears as]{.mark} the **[textbook]{.mark}
definition of [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [the **erasure** of
the political]{.underline}, the covering over of social antagonism
(Žižek, 1989: 25).

The accompanying proclivity is that [the production of an authentic
Global South subaltern space ends up **militating against** the putative
political subject of decoloniality]{.underline} -- [the
subaltern]{.underline}. In this regard, echoing Spivak (1988), Asher
(2013: 838--9) suggests that Mignolo and his decoloniality peers are
'turning to subaltern knowledge to fulfill \[their\] desire to create a
just world for humans and non-humans'. Decolonial jouissance of the
pluriverse induces the absence of critical self-reflexivity on the part
of the decolonial analyst, with the latter portraying himself as
transparent relay able to accurately capture the subaltern voice. The
search for a subaltern pluriverse thus becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy: you project a pluriversal platform on the subaltern and then
rejoice in miraculously finding it! But in this mêlée, the subaltern is
not heard (which is why my above critique of Zapatista participatory
politics says less about the Zapatistas than Mignolo's construction of
them).

Mignolo's [Manichaean [argumentation]{.mark} also tends to be **broadly
dismissive** of Western thought]{.underline}, [accusing it of complicity
in the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}, [thus appealing for it to
be superseded]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2002: 80, 2010: 346). He seems [to
[**conflate** hegemonic European]{.mark}]{.underline}
([colonial]{.underline}) [[thought with European thought writ
large]{.underline}]{.mark}. In so doing, he [**[fails to
acknowledge]{.mark}** the many [European]{.mark} intellectual
**[counter-discourses]{.mark}** to colonial rationality or binary
thinking]{.underline} (anti-imperialism, non-dualism, communitarianism,
etc.) [with [which]{.mark}]{.underline}, for all intents and purposes,
[much of [decolonial thought is **allied**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
fails as well to account for his own debt to so-called Eurocentrism,
disavowing that his intellectual background, as well as the very
language (English) and critical tools he deploys (e.g. geopolitics,
difference, epistemology, gnoseology, aesthesis), are unavoidably
Eurocentric (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 99--100). Worse still, his
[policing of the boundaries of what is]{.underline}
'**[Western]{.underline}**'/'non-Western' [ends up **eliding** the
centuries-old cultural and economic exchange between Europe and its
putative others]{.underline} (Africa, the Arab world, Indigenous
America, the Indian subcontinent, etc.); [or indeed the **substantial
history** of subaltern resistance]{.underline} -- [in Europe's
colonies]{.underline}, [and in Europe itself]{.underline} -- [that is
**integral** to the emergence of such notions as]{.underline}
'equality', '**[freedom]{.underline}**', and 'social justice' (see, for
example, Anghie, 2005; Buck-Morss, 2009; Cusicanqui, 2012).

Thus, Mignolo's [decolonial disavowal]{.underline} of the
unconscious/Real [is]{.underline} not only deeply ideological for
romanticizing subaltern pluriversality, but also **[deeply
depoliticizing]{.underline}**. Rather than seeing internal (community or
social movement) differences and contradictions as weaknesses/traumas to
be suppressed or avoided in order to produce a perfect subaltern 'hero',
why not try to face them head-on to invent new and creative (although
never harmonious) subaltern political spaces? [Rather than understanding
colonial violence and dispossession as a reason to **nostalgically
manufacture**]{.underline} past or present [glory or wallow
in]{.underline} victimhood and **[resentment]{.underline}** ([against
European thinkers]{.underline}), [[why not]{.mark} struggle to [**become
proficient** with]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and
**use**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[European discourses of emancipation and
freedom]{.mark} to fight for subaltern equality and social justice
everywhere?]{.underline} [[The Western colonial legacy is]{.mark} indeed
[imperialist]{.mark} domination and plunder]{.underline}, [[but it is
**also**]{.underline},]{.mark} as Žižek (2009) underlines, 'that of [the
**[self-critical examination]{.mark}** of the violence and exploitation
the West itself brought to the Third World]{.underline} . . . the West
supplied the very standards by which it (and its critics) measures its
own criminal past' (p. 115). [The [antagonisms of European
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this sense, [[can be]{.mark} viewed as
**[powerful]{.mark} subaltern political
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And such is the case not only for the
subaltern from the Global South, but also for the subaltern from the
Global North: their common predicaments could be the occasion to find
cause together in shared trauma (Kapoor, 2020: xv, 66; Kapoor and
Zalloua, 2022: 20). [This is something that]{.underline} Mignolo's
[demonization of the West **precludes**]{.underline}, failing as it does
to distinguish hegemonic from subaltern (counter-) discourses, whether
in the West or otherwise, thereby further depoliticizing the subaltern.

Finally, there is the issue of [the [exclusion of the
**state**]{.mark}]{.underline} and political economy in Mignolo's gloss.
In regard to the state, Mignolo stands firmly against it, predictably
seeing it as the political expression of (Western) coloniality. For him,
pluriversal spaces would 'exist independently of the state and
corporations' by delinking 'from state forms of governance, from the
economy of accumulation' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv). Thus, 'the future
would be composed of "communal nodes" around the planet cooperating
rather than competing with each other . . . \[through\] the entanglement
of several cosmologies connected today in power differential' (Mignolo,
2011: 283, 2018: x).

But Mignolo's position [[appears]{.mark} politically
**[naive]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Without some]{.underline}]{.mark}
[form of **[coordinating authority]{.mark}** like a state]{.underline},
[it [remains **unclear**]{.mark} [how]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[security and well-being]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'communal nodes'
[[would be realized]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[what would ensure
**cooperation**]{.underline},]{.mark} [rather than
conflict]{.underline}, [[among and between nodes]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially given 'power differential'; [[and how]{.mark} these nodes
would be able [to **thwart** the]{.mark} continuing [incursion
of]{.mark} global [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or threats
from]{.mark} both the [**Western** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
['**[de-Westernized]{.underline}**' [powers]{.underline}]{.mark}
envisaged by Mignolo. It seems, in fact, that his [pluriversal
politics]{.underline} [**unconsciously requires** a]{.underline}
national, regional, and/or transnational [state]{.underline} to ensure
[the [coexistence of]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[many
worlds]{.underline}**']{.mark}. He [[appears to **count** on]{.mark}
such things as [peace enforcement]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.underline}, [provision of [universal education and health
care]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[regulation of
multinationals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[campaigns against]{.mark} global
[viral infections]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and so forth]{.underline}, for
his communal nodes [to **thrive**]{.underline}.

As to **[[political economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it [[is]{.mark} all
but **[absent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Mignolo's political viewpoint,
given his pluriversal privileging of epistemological, at the expense of
material, decolonization. He does sketchily mention imperial resource
extraction in his [critique of coloniality]{.underline}, but says almost
nothing about the material dimensions of pluriversality. This is because
(expectedly) he [assesses Marxist political economy as]{.underline}
integral to a '**[Eurocentered]{.underline}** critique' (Mignolo, 2011:
xi, xviii), [**glossing over** the many variants of Third World
Marxisms]{.underline} ([whether Nepalese]{.underline},
[Cuban]{.underline}, [Chinese]{.underline}, [South African]{.underline},
[Peruvian]{.underline}, [Indian]{.underline}, etc., [many of which have
been actualized as political projects]{.underline} with varying degrees
of success/failure, including democratic communism in Kerala and Bengal,
for example). Mignolo (2010) looks instead to 'delinking from
capitalism' epistemologically (p. 339), [[as though decolonized
knowledge production will undo not just]{.mark} **neoliberal
[ideology]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} the **[structures]{.mark}** of global
capitalism]{.underline}. [The **[overwhelming evidence]{.mark}** to date
[points to]{.mark} just [the **opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}: as
mentioned earlier, [the [success of]{.mark} corporate [capitalism
lies]{.mark} in part [in its **co-optation** of]{.mark} the
[epistemological]{.mark}-cultural [claims]{.mark} of social
movements]{.underline} -- [because [not only do they not pose a
**threat** to accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} they [can
also be **commodified** to advance accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is all the more the case with a decolonial politics of authenticity
which, like intersectionality, fixes and essentializes subaltern
culture/identity, thereby enabling its commoditization.

Consequently, given the disavowal of any state-like authority or
meaningful materialist analysis or strategy, Mignolo's decolonial
pluriversality yields to little more than what decolonial Indigenous
scholar Cusicanqui (2012) sees as 'multiculturalism' (p. 104).
Decoloniality may well mount a [critique of the coloniality of
power]{.underline}, but in Mignolo's hands, just as in Crenshaw's, such
critique nonetheless [ends up **facilitating**]{.underline}, **[not
challenging]{.underline}**, [global capitalism]{.underline}.
[Localism]{.underline}/particularism [**nicely suits** capitalism as
much as coloniality]{.underline}, [since it can be **readily
accommodated** if not **commodified**]{.underline}. So as with Crenshaw,
my claim is that Mignolo's disavowal of state/political economy and his
accompanying advocacy of the local amounts to an unconscious acceptance
of capitalist multiculturalism. We are thus left with another case of
'fetishistic disavowal' -- a secret love for the System in spite of an
outwardly biting critique of it. The global capitalist order sets (and
is allowed to set) the boundary for decolonial counterhegemonic
critique.

The happy marriage of capitalism, Afropessimism, and liberal identity
politics

We and our students want radical transformation, and so many often jump
to the latest and seemingly most radical sounding phrases, slogans, and
theories. In education, as in so many other disciplines, one of the
increasingly dominant phrases is "anti-Blackness" and the theory of
Afropessimism. The two foundational theorists here are Frank Wilderson
and Jared Sexton. For Wilderson, Afro-pessimism contends that "Blackness
cannot be separated from slavery," and that "the Slave's relationship to
violence is open-ended, gratuitous, without reason or constraint,"
whereas "the human's relationship to violence is always
contingent."\[3\]

[There are crucial problems with this framework that make it perfectly
**acceptable to capitalism** and perfectly antithetical to those who
want to change the world]{.underline}. For one, [they are completely
**Eurocentric** in that Africa and the African **diaspora** are
**flattened into "Blackness"** as a condition of the
"human."]{.underline} As Greg Thomas notes, [this is "the \[B\]lackness
and humanism of white Americanism, specifically and restrictively, an
isolationist or **exceptionalist Americanism**]{.underline}."\[4\] In
other words, [Afropessimism takes aim at a civil society and takes
refuge in a Blackness that are both uniquely American. The **U.S.
historical** and political **experience** is **transformed into** a
**transcendent**, static, and universal **ontological status** or
structure.]{.underline} More specifically, [the theories of academics in
highly prestigious and exclusive institutions in the U.S. are presented
as ahistorical and global realities.]{.underline}

[As identities, Black and Blackness are, in the U.S., fairly recent
developments.]{.underline} The earliest recorded appearances are in
Richard Wright's 1954, Black Power and in 1966 as the first words spoken
by Black Panther Stokely Carmichael when he left his jail cell after
imprisonment for registering voters. White and whiteness are older but
still relatively recent. Theodore Allen writes that he "found no
instance of the official use of the word 'white' as a token of social
status before its appearance in a Virginia law passed in 1691, referring
to 'English or other white women.'"\[5\] The point here, as Eugene
Puryear observes, "is that [the ideology of **white supremacy** emerged
**not** because of **timeless antagonisms** based on phenotype
differences, but in a **precise historical context** related to the
development of racial slavery]{.underline}."\[6\] [This is precisely the
historical context that Afropessimism erases and precisely the
phenotypes they use to define Blackness.]{.underline}

Afropessimism addresses an apparent radical omission in the primary
theory that oppressed people have utilized for liberation: Marxism.
[Wilderson's work]{.underline}, however, [is based on a fundamental
**misreading of Marxism**]{.underline}, such as his contention that in
"Marxist discourse" (whatever that is) "racism is read off the base, as
it were, as being derivative of political economy."\[7\] To be sure,
[there's an unfortunate history of some Marxist groupings asserting
"class first" politics, but Marx and Engels, and Lenin, together with
the history of the international **communist movement**, always
**asserted** the **primacy of race**. Marx's theory of class was a
theory of race and colonialism, as was his communist organizing. As a
historical-materialist, Marx understood that the base and superstructure
of society change over time and are context-dependent. Neither the
**base nor superstructure are unified**, static, or ahistorical. The
**relations of production** in the U.S. are **neither unified nor even**
strictly **economic** in the sense that they're **structured** and
divided **by hierarchies of race, nationality, gender, dis/ability,
sexuality**, and other divisions]{.underline}. In an 1894 letter, Engels
clarifies yet again the base-superstructure model, what it entails, how
it works, and exactly what it's supposed to do. First, he says that
"**[economic conditions]{.underline}**... [ultimately **determines
historical development**. But **race** itself **is an economic
factor**]{.underline}."\[8\]

[Marx not only supported anti-colonial uprisings in India and China but
even said that they might ignite the revolution in Britain]{.underline}.
"It may seem a very strange, and very paradoxical assertion," Marx wrote
about the 1850-53 Taiping Rebellion in China, "that the next uprising of
the people of Europe, and their next movement for republican freedom and
economy of government, may depend more probably on what is now passing
in the Celestial Empire."\[9\]

Marx fought ruthlessly against racism and national chauvinism,
particularly as he experienced the deep-seated racism of English workers
against the Irish. He "argued that an English workers\' party,
representing workers from an oppressor nation, had the duty to support
an oppressed nation's self-determination and independence" and that
"English workers could never attain liberation as long as the Irish
continued to be oppressed."\[10\] [He recognized that the fate of Black
slaves, Black workers, and white workers were bound together when he
wrote in Capital that "**Labour cannot** **emancipate itself in the
white skin where in the \[B\]lack it is branded**]{.underline}."\[11\]
Marx even organized workers to support the abolitionist struggle by
galvanizing them to oppose a British intervention in the U.S. Civil War
on behalf of the slaveocracy, an intervention that, because the British
had the largest Navy in the world, could have altered the war
drastically.\[12\]

[Perhaps the real problem is that Marx treats race as a dynamic and
contingent social production rather than a fixed and abstract
ontological category. **Black** people face particular forms of
**oppression** in the U.S. and elsewhere, as do other oppressed and
exploited peoples. These **change over time** and are **in a dialectical
relationship with** the overal **social totality**]{.underline}. Iyko
Day got it right by equating economic reductionism to Afro-pessimism,
insofar as it "frames racial slavery as a base for a colonial
superstructure" and "fails to take into account the dialectics of
settler colonial capitalism."\[13\]

Why the neoliberal university loves Afropessimism

[The reason **anti-Blackness critique** is welcome in schools is because
it is **devoid of praxis** and politics]{.underline}, or, to be more
precise, because [it **celebrates** its **lack of politics**. The
**impossibility of praxis** and the rejection of organizing are
fundamental tenets for two reasons. The first is that there is **no
answer to the question "what is to be done?"** and the second is that
the **mass movements necessary for transformation are "from the jump, an
anti-black formation,"**]{.underline} as Wilderson told
IMIXWHATILIKE.\[14\] Of course, [the only thing to do is to condemn
every attempt at fighting oppression and improving material
conditions.]{.underline} For example, when a student group at one of our
schools staged a protest when Condoleeza Rice came to speak, they were
denounced as "anti-Black." There was no political criteria for such a
denouncement, no defense of Rice, and likely no knowledge of the reasons
behind the protest. It didn't matter that Rice was a key figure of the
white supremacist imperialist power structure, or that she played a
major role in the murder of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the torture
of thousands of Arab and African people

. Examples of "anti-Blackness" that often come up in organizing are that
non-Black people of color are to be met with suspicion when organizing
on issues that sharply affect Black people. One such issue is
immigration. [In the struggle for immigrant rights, which is often
overcoded as a "Latinx" issue, some Black activists and organizers point
to the fact that 44% of those caged by ICE, for example, are Haitians.
Instead of directing their ire towards the racist state that holds many
Black immigrants in horrendous conditions, the focus then becomes the
irrevocable anti-Blackness that exists in Latinx communities. Ideologies
like **Afro Pessimism have working class people of color**]{.underline}
(Black people included) [**fighting** amongst **each other**, with the
**same framework as liberal identity politics**. They both **reduce
solidarity to checking** one's **privilege and fashioning oneself** as
the consummate ally of Black people and their liberation.]{.underline}
So, instead of building a united front against the racist state, the
lack of corporate/mainstream media focus on the fact that there are many
Black immigrants, and immigration is a "Black issue" unnecessarily
shifts attention to other workers who are subjected to the same
"anti-Black" ideology of the ruling class and it's media apparatuses.
[Instead of calling out the "Latinx community" for their
"anti-Blackness" a **revolutionary perspective frames** the **issue** as
not one **stemming from** any said community, but from the **ruling
class which oppresses** the vast majority of **immigrants** in this
country.]{.underline}

[**Capital** in these instances are **let off the hook**. The
**problem** is **no longer** that the ruling class owns the **means of
production and thus** the means of **ideological production that
reinforce anti-working class ideologies such as racism**. The problem is
the "anti-Blackness"\--and the often posited "inherent"
anti-Blackness\--of non-Black communities]{.underline}. It's a
structural feature of society, but apparently one that can't be changed.
As a result, [there's no need to do anything except
critique.]{.underline}

No wonder, then, that Afropessimism is so welcome in the neoliberal
university and the increasingly corporatized public school system in the
U.S. It's incredibly easy to call something anti-Black, to condemn
anti-Blackness, and to play more-radical-than-thou. It's more than easy,
it's what academia is about. Moreover, and this is related to the Rice
protest mentioned earlier, [when "Black faces" do appear in "high
places," they're immunized from any possible critique]{.underline} from
any group that isn't Black (enough). It doesn't matter if the head of a
school, corporation, or any other entity has the same politics as the
imperialist and racist power structure, because they're black and so to
critique or challenge them would be an act of anti-Blackness.

This last reason is why **[white people love
Afropessimism]{.underline}** so much. [The **vague calls to "follow
Black people\'\'** not only **fulfill racist tropes** that all Black
people are the same]{.underline} (in, for example, their unruliness and
"threat" to society) [but moreover **let white people off the hook for
doing** any real **political investigation and work**. The real response
to "Follow Black people\'\' is: "Which Black people?"]{.underline}
Should Derek follow his comrade Nino or John McWhorter? Should he go to
the police protest organized by the local Black Lives Matter group or
the one organized by the local Congress of Racial Equality? Should he
get his racial politics from Barack Obama or Glen Ford? He certainly
shouldn't get his politics\--or take his lessons in class
struggle\--from today's Afropessimists.

[None of this is to devalue Black leadership in the Black liberation
movement, to be clear. **Black people have and will lead the Black
struggle** **and** the broader **class struggle**. Nor is it to claim
that random white people should show up to a Black Lives Matter protest
and grab the microphone.]{.underline} Then again, how much of a problem
is that really? [Shouldn't we **forget** the **myth that we can learn
all the proper rules before we struggle and** instead **just** go out
and **struggle**? And **as we struggle, be conscientious** of our
actions and how they could be perceived; know that **we'll make mistakes
and own up to them**; and most importantly **build with those whom this
racist society has segregated** us from so we can **unite against** a
**common enemy**. Black people will lead the Black struggle and the
class struggle. So too will Asian Americans, Indigenous people, and
Latino/a/xs. So too will the child of an African immigrant and a
Filipino domestic worker. So too will some white people. The key
ingredients are unity, political clarity, and strategic
proficiency.]{.underline}

Such a recipe entails a necessary risk in that, first, politics are
divisive and draw lines between friends and enemies and that, second,
[achieving unity and strategic proficiency takes hard work without any
guarantees of success. Educators who are or want to be
radical]{.underline}, however, [have no choice but to accept this risk.
**We need to be rooted in movements and resist incorporation into
neoliberal structures**, refusing to allow them to guide our political
decisions. Only if we have hope and faith in the power of the masses to
change the world does it make sense to struggle at all. We choose to
struggle! And we hope our students do too.]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Geopoetics

#### Black Geopoetics reifies Eurocentric humanism through its articulation of blackness as a mere relation of difference, creating a didactic reliance on whiteness that it fails to overcome. This the trap of metaphysics that engulfs the 1AC's method -- Only by centering class and the overcoming of the master/slave dialectic can we positively effect change by shifting the terrain upon which the Anthropocene is situated.

School; 2-1-19; "A Billion Black Anthropocenes";

-- Langham EY

[**Yusoff** draws from Hartmann and other in **shying away** **from**
**thinking in terms of the agency of the struggle for Black
freedom**]{.underline} as that neglects the way in which freedom was
conceived on the back of black subjection in the first place. [But I
think **this neglects the way** **that** for James, **black freedom was
connected** **to** **what the French proletariat meant by the rights of
'man' even though it was excluded from the bourgeois rights of man. The
axis of class** **is** everywhere **flattened in this
discourse.**]{.underline}

[**Yusoff does not decenter Eurocentric** **logics** as much as she
thinks she does. **Blackness ends up still being in a relation of
difference to a Eurocentric geopolitics.**]{.underline} To talk in the
language of racialized categories themselves for a moment: [The Asian
population of the planet is bigger than that of Black and white
combined. And yet Asia is hardly even mentioned, as if it had no agency
or presence in the Anthropocene.]{.underline}

[There are **other readings of the Anthropocene**]{.underline} that
Yusoff might open up even **[beyond]{.underline}** those of [**her
imagining.**]{.underline} Black accelerationism opts not for an intimacy
of the Black (non) subject with the earth but with techne. Here,
Blackness precedes rather than lags whiteness and might be an
almost-utopian prefiguration of a technics of survival to come.

[Another way to play out the variables of this twisted space of language
might be to oblige whiteness to confront the illusory nature of its own
claim to Man-hood. **Yusoff demolishes** **the** too-hasty **inclusion
of us all in Anthropos**]{.underline}, as if slavery had not happened.
[**One could go further and strip the claim of Man-hood from white
liberal discourse.** **We're all just rocks.**]{.underline} That wasn't
quite what Vernadsky meant by introducing the category of *biosphere*
into geology, but maybe it is an unintended consequence.

Or **[one could]{.underline}**, with Paul Gilroy, [**keep open the space
of a certain humanism**, but **not** one me**rely expanded to include
its other.**]{.underline} Gilroy's reading of [Fanon holds open the
category of the human through the negation of its own limits. That
Man-hood excludes Blackness means that **Blackness negates an existing
concept of the human and points forward to the struggle for another
humanism.** The human is in this version an always unfinished concept,
borne forward out of the struggles against both fascism and colonialism.
The human is the name of that struggle to negate exclusion from
itself.]{.underline}

What I think is most difficult is to keep in tension the
incommensurability of geological and historical knowledge. [**Yusoff
attacks** what she perceives as the sovereignty of **geologic
knowledge** by **claiming** sovereignty **instead** for a
**counter-knowledge**, a Black geopoetics. **But** **instead of rival
claims to sovereignty, could there be a comradely collaboration
between** forms of **knowledge** which yet have incommensurable objects
and methods?]{.underline}

[Yusoff sees in geology as a kind of knowledge what is there for someone
trained]{.underline} (ironically enough) [in the humanities or
qualitative social sciences, but can't see what appears as deeply
strange about geology from that perspective.]{.underline} This is what
Quentin Meillassoux called the *archfossil*: an object of knowledge,
such as a rock, whose existence predates not only the human, but any
form of life. How can there be a knowledge of an object for which there
could be no corresponding subject?

I dissent from Meillassoux's solution to the problem of the archefossil,
but not to the posing of the problem. In this I am closer to Karen
Barad's *agential realism.* [**The inhuman apparatus of a science yields
a knowledge which produces through an epistemic cut an object on the one
hand and a subject on the other.** The nonhuman appears to the human,
but both are the product of an inhuman mix of labor and technics. From
this point of view, the slave is also an inhuman component that
produces, by means of an epistemic cut, objects and subjects. In this
case, the new world as territory and property on the one hand, and on
the other, the white planter as example of Man as subject.]{.underline}

[But to say that these procedures take the same form is not to say much
more than that all forms of knowledge are a subset of that praxis in
which the inhuman mediates the nonhuman to the human and produces them
as separate. The form taken by the product is an artifact of the means
of its production. But that will apply also to a **Black geopoetics**, a
practice that **also makes a cut**, in this case **separating
Blackness** itself **as thing, as ontological category.**]{.underline}

[**It's a question of priorities.** "**There can be no address of the
planetary failures of modernism or its master-subject, Man, without a
commitment to overcoming extractive capitalism**."]{.underline} (61) [If
**capitalism** is what this still is. Whatever the now-dominant mode of
production is, perhaps it could be **at the center of a praxis rather
than peripheral to it.**]{.underline} I'm inclined to think that
**[metaphysics]{.underline}** (or what Yuk Hui calls a *cosmotechnics*)
[of the human]{.underline} ([coded as white]{.underline}), [the
inhuman]{.underline} (techne, but also [the racialized
other]{.underline}) [and the nonhuman]{.underline} (what Meillassoux
calls the *great outdoors*beyond any correlation to any subject) **[is a
derivative rather than causative force.]{.underline}**

[While attending to the 'Anthropos' in Anthropocene is important,
perhaps it would be timely also to think about the 'cene' part as
well.]{.underline} Cene comes from Kairos, an ancient rhetorical concept
with meaning that include timeliness, circumstance and possibility --
[the 'critical' moment.]{.underline} Where Kronos is a consistent time,
Kairos is the time of the break. Kairos is also the time in which God
acts. It is the time of a great outdoors, a nonhuman time.

[The discovery of this nonhuman time of the break that is the
Anthropocene calls us to be critical of Anthropos an historical agent
operating in the time of Chronos that is not what it appears to
be.]{.underline} But it also calls us to attend to Kairos a temporarily
that has nothing to do with the human at all. Doing both at once,
thinking these times together, is an untimely meditation for the epoch.

The collapse of socialist versions of collective agriculture further
contributes to the sense that there are no alternatives, hence nothing
to debate. It is worth recalling, however, that the rationale of the
Vietnamese Communist Party for imposing collectivization in the 1960s
was not a doctrinaire position on the virtues of collectivism. Rather,
it was the pragmatic recognition that the first wave of land reform the
party carried out in the 1950s, the distribution of land to individual
peasant households, rapidly slid backward as land was again concentrated
through the mundane mechanism of debt. As a commentator observed in
1964,

> A drought, a heavy rainfall, the illness of a buffalo or of a member
> of his family---things quite frequent in Vietnam--- suffice to compel
> the peasant to go into debt and sell part of his property. . . . To
> the economic processes of differentiation of social classes under the
> regime of individual exploitation, one must oppose, not coercive or
> repressive measures, but the conversion of economic structures, the
> setting up of new production relations. (Published under the name "N
> N" in Vietnamese Studies and quoted in Jorgensen 2006:165.)

Vietnamese collectivism, as we now know, also slid backward, as peasants
insisted on their right to engage in marketoriented production and
succeeded, through their "everyday resistance," in persuading the regime
to recognize the de facto reprivatization of land and labor they had
already implemented (Kerkvliet 2005). The outcome has been increasing
inequality in access to agricultural land, albeit with important
regional variations (Akram-Lodhi 2005; Sikor 2001).17

[A **second reason** for the **impoverished debate** about
**capitalism** is the resolute **[focus of activists]{.mark}** in the
global peasant movement [on the]{.mark} macro, transnational, or
**["global" scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the analysis supplied by
La Via Campesina, for example, locates the problems afflicting rural
people in the figure of the transnational agrofood corporation. In
particular, the movement highlights the regime of tariffs and subsidies
that supports these corporations at the expense of small-scale farmers
whose subsidies were withdrawn in the name of "structural adjustment"
and the efficiency of "free" markets. The movement offers little
analysis of processes of dispossession that arise among small-scale
farmers (see La Via Campesina and FIAN International 2006; Rosset 2006).
Its scholar activists, heirs to what Terence Byres calls the
"neopopulist" tradition, argue for redistributive land reform on the
assumption that small-scale farmers, once they are given land, would
hold onto it, and "nowhere consider the possibility that the
redistributive land reform that they advocate might, if it were
successful, lay the basis for capitalism from below; might create
structures within which processes of differentiation flourished and a
class of capitalist farmers emerged" (2004:30).18

Presumably, [the **macrofocus**]{.underline} of the "neopopulist" stance
of the global peasant movement [[and]{.mark} its **[reluctance to
examine microprocesses of dispossession]{.mark}** among small-scale
farmers [are **strategic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Many
people]{.underline}]{.mark}** who [[are **comfortable** with
**small-scale capitalism**]{.mark} and describe it in populist terms
(income generation, local business, entrepreneurship)]{.underline} are
convinced that big corporations are evil and should be stopped. The
peasant movement needs strong, clear images that can mobilize a broad
constituency both in rural areas, where too much attention to class
differentiation would be divisive, and in the cities, where components
of the urban middle class support the movement out of nostalgia for
wholesome rural ways of life. [[The]{.mark} transnational indigenous
peoples' [movement is]{.mark} **even more [constrained]{.mark}**[,
because]{.mark} **urban [people expect indigenous people to be authentic
bearers of]{.mark}** cultural difference and **[ecological
wisdom]{.mark}**, a **salve to their anxious modernity**]{.underline}.
**[Class [differentiation among indigenous
people]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whether small-scale farmers or the
"neotribal capitalist" corporations in New Zealand starkly described by
Elizabeth Rata, [**[runs counter to this image]{.mark}**, **[as
do]{.mark}** the **[U.S.]{.mark} and Canadian [natives]{.mark}**
[who]{.mark} **make use of their distinct legal status to [build
casinos]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} Amazonians who **[sell]{.mark} off their
[timber instead of conserving it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 [Theirs are
**not heroic stories**, so it is not surprising that **[indigenous
peoples' capitalist practices do not figure]{.mark} strongly [in
the]{.mark} movement's [public transcript]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[In the **preferred narrative**]{.mark} of the indigenous peoples'
movement, **[indigenous people are the victims of capitalist processes
intruding from the outside]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some [advocates
suggest that indigenous people still have difficulty handling money and
are easily impoverished by debt, enticed by consumer goods, or tricked
by incoming migrants, entrepreneurs, or officials into selling land for
a pittance]{.underline}. [They are also sold out by their leaders when
indigenous systems to check abuses are undermined]{.underline}
(Colchester, n.d.; Colchester et al. 2006:15--16). They need "more time
to adjust to market pressures" (Lynch and Harwell 2002:5).
[They]{.underline} also [need a protective legal regime that supports
collective tenure]{.underline}. [Naming the state as the principal
villain]{.underline}, Marcus Colchester [argues that "it is state denial
of communal rights that causes land ownership to be fragmented and
individualized, and traditions of custodianship and resource management
undermined]{.underline}" (1994:76). Based on consultations with
indigenous groups, he is convinced that they want "the right to
collective ownership of their communal territories. They want legal
recognition granting them inalienable freehold title to their ancestral
domains" (Colchester 1994:72; see also Lynch and Harwell 2002). With
their land rights entrenched, he suggests, these communities would stay
intact. He recognizes that there are countervailing desires for
individualized tenure among people who want to engage in
entrepreneurial, profit-making, and potentially accumulative
agriculture, but he points to many examples in which individual tenure
has led to loss of land, livelihood, and cultural integrity. It is, in
short, a risky path (see AMAN, World Agroforestry Centre, and Forest
Peoples Programme 2003; Colchester et al. 2006).

Agrarian Dispossession Revisited: Renewing the Communal Fix

The two contemporary iterations of the communal fix I examine in this
section are designed to protect selected groups of rural people from the
risk of dispossession while offering them the benefits of market
involvement. One version has been put forward by the World Bank, as a
modification of the stance that advocates full market integration for
everyone, everywhere. Like colonial authorities, and building on their
work, the World Bank has started to divide populations and promote a
diversity of tenure regimes suited to the cultural proclivities and
capacities of particular groups. Citing research by anthropologists on
the impoverishing effects of land titling in Africa in the 1970s and
1980s, the 1990 World Development Report (World Bank 1990) proclaimed
the bank's rediscovery of the virtues of collective tenure. The report
acknowledged that the "shift toward individual rights tends to undermine
the ability of traditional systems to ensure that all members of the
extended family have access to land. This feature of their land system
has helped some countries in Africa to avoid the extremes of poverty and
landlessness that are common in much of Asia and Latin America" (World
Bank 1990:65). Using indirect language that carefully avoids holding the
bank responsible for an erroneous policy that intensified the
dispossession of the poor, a report by consultants for the bank stated
that "the economic arguments for individual rights have been reassessed
and it is now suggested there is little evidence that customary tenure
arrangements are a constraint on agricultural productivity." Not only is
individualized tenure unnecessary from the perspective of efficient
production, the consultants observed, it can have unintended negative
effects, as it is linked to "increased landlessness as land markets
develop, the fact that people may be encouraged to sell their land for
short-term returns, and 'land grabbing' by the social elite or those
with privileged access to information and formal institutions" (Land
Equity International 2003:86, 87; see also Deininger and Binswanger
2001:418--419).

In view of these findings, the World Bank began to look favorably on
collective titles for indigenous groups in Asia and Latin America as
well as in Africa (Deininger and Binswanger 2001:417--420). It committed
itself to preserving the collective tenure systems of indigenous people,
unless the people concerned opt for individual title (World Bank 2005,
par. 17). The ideal collective tenure system for the bank combines the
insurance or "safety net" function of collective rights to inalienable
land with measures to encourage efficiency. The bank vision does not
share the moral doubt about the virtues of capitalism that surfaced in
some colonial debates. It promotes capitalism while seeking to manage
its dispossessory effects. A collective tenure system that recognizes
and rewards the investment of individuals in land improvement, and
permits transfer within the group by means of inheritance and "exchange"
provides, in bank thinking, an optimal balance of protections and
incentives. It is even better when there are mechanisms for the group to
convert to full individual tenure when the time is right. Sadly, bank
experts observe, many collective tenure systems have been weakened by
encroachment of "outsiders" or are administered by rapacious chiefs in
an unfair or corrupt manner (Deininger and Binswanger 2001:417--420). In
these situations, individual tenure is inevitable, and the best that can
be done to protect smallholders is to devise better systems of
information, insurance, and credit to protect them from "shocks" and
"distress sales" (Deininger and Binswanger 2001:427). At this point, the
bank joins hands with the "neopopulists" of the global peasant movement
I described earlier to treat the separation of small farmers from direct
access to the means of production as an unfortunate accident from which
wise policy makers should protect them. Once again, the analysis of the
dispossessory dynamics of agrarian capitalism is seriously truncated.

The second renewal of the communal fix I want to explore here builds on
the advocacy of the 1980s and 1990s that began to link indigeneity and
the promotion of collective tenure regimes to the objective of forest
conservation. Like the renewed communal fix at the World Bank, the
latest iteration of the indigenous people and conservation platform ca.
2000 is distinctly market focused. It circumvents the problem of
defining who is indigenous by stringing the concept of indigeneity
together with allied terms such as local people, forest dwellers, or
forest-dependent communities. All these people, proponents argue, are
culturally distinct in the sense that they are embedded in communities
and attached to forests. But they are not disconnected from markets or
uninterested in profit. The goal of the program the advocates propose is
to link indigenous people and other "forest dwellers" more firmly to
markets as a means to secure both their livelihoods and forest
conservation. But for the plan to work, these people must not be granted
individualized, alienable title to their land.

Two transnational advocacy groups promoting the market-oriented
conservation agenda are Forest Trends and the Rights and Resources
Initiative. They set out explicitly to change the format of indigenous
reserves pioneered in Brazil that "give indigenous peoples a place to
live and a place to practice their traditional livelihoods" but do not
empower them "to use their resources in a commercial manner" (Ellsworth
and White 2004:32). The solution they propose is to give "indigenous
communities" full legal title to their collectively owned forests so
that they can sell goods and services derived from these forests,
especially "ecosystem services" such as biodiversity protection,
watershed management, and carbon sequestration (Ellsworth and White
2004). The special virtue of these particular services from the
perspective of this advocacy agenda is that they can be supplied only so
long as the forest remains intact. Hence, they give indigenous
communities a built-in incentive to maintain their forests rather than
logging or farming them, leasing them out, or dividing them up into
individualized parcels.

[Advocates for [this]{.mark} new version of indigeneity, with its
particular **[way of rationalizing the attempt to fix a group of people
firmly onto the land]{.mark}**, concur on a central point:
"indigenous"]{.underline} and "forest-dwelling" [people should not
become capitalist farmers. Indeed, the advocates' reports contain almost
**no discussion of agriculture or agrarian livelihoods**. Their
discussions of the **individualization** of **land tenure** among
**indigenous groups** highlight]{.underline} corrupt implementation and
the [tendency to **land loss**]{.underline} (Ellsworth and White
2004:14--15). [The [implication is]{.mark} that **[commercial
ag]{.mark}**riculture [is a practice from which indigenous people can
**only lose**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One document mentions "350 million
indigenous and tribal people who are entirely dependent on natural
forests" (Rights and Resources Initiative 2005:1). [In this advocacy
agenda, it is **not just agrarian capitalism that is occluded** but
**farming in toto**, presumably because farming is **(a) usually
individualized**, **(b) associated with** the **individualization of
land tenure**, and **(c) in competition with**]{.underline} forest
[**conservation**. It is an agenda in which the livelihoods of
indigenous people are]{.underline}, in the words of anthropologist
Andrew Walker, [firmly "**arborealized**"]{.underline} (2004). [Further,
they are **collectivized** and **pinned to inalienable
land**]{.underline}.

In Indonesia, where Forest Trends has linked up with activists who have
long been protesting against the unilateral appropriation of villagers'
land by the Forest Department, advocates describe villagers' land use
practices as "community managed agroforests" (Contreras-Hermosilla and
Fay 2005: iii). This label both arborealizes and collectivizes. It
strengthens the advocates' argument that any land currently claimed by
the Forest Department that is restored to villagers should not be
granted to individuals but only to communities. The advocates are
explicit in this rationale: collective ownership will protect indigenous
people from impoverishing themselves by selling their land; it will
supply them with an incentive to manage the forest because they will be
attached to it on a permanent basis; it will also help to convince the
Forest Department to release land to villagers, something the department
has thus far refused to do on the grounds that villagers would promptly
sell it (Contreras-Hermosilla and Fay 2005:20).20

[The point **[overlook]{.mark}ed** by the advocates is [that the people
they describe]{.mark} in arborealized terms]{.underline} as "forest
dwelling" or "forest-dependent communities" [[are **also
farmers**]{.mark}. They [have]{.mark} **permanent fields** growing wet
rice. They also have groves of **[commercial]{.mark} tree
[crops]{.mark}** that have been pervasive in the region **[for
a]{.mark}t least one [century]{.mark}** and sometimes two. Further, they
**[claim]{.mark}** these tree crop groves [as]{.mark} their
**[individual property]{.mark}**, theirs to mortgage or sell should the
need arise. Thus, there is a disjuncture between the advocacy platform
and the sense people have of their entitlement. This is a disjuncture
that also exists among villagers, **[some]{.mark}** of whom
**[support]{.mark}** the **[commoditization of land]{.mark}** while
others oppose it]{.underline}.

In an interview with indigenous rights advocates, one Dayak leader who
has been prominent in the indigenous peoples' movement in the Indonesian
island of Kalimantan made his argument for reasserting community control
in these terms: "The ideal concept is to have community control of
customary land. The proper application of adat means lands are never
sold. But what is happening is that people are being forced to sell
their lands" (Colchester 2005:15). Asked by the interviewer how he would
accommodate the fact that Dayak rubber smallholders have been buying and
selling land for more than 30 years, he said "the principle must be that
customary lands belong to the collective. So if there are actors who
sell and buy the principle must be enforced. The land must not be seen
as empty. The land has its own value and is filled with spirit(s). It
cannot be seen as just land. It has precious values and strong spiritual
meaning. People who have sold their land must be fined and sanctioned
for these actions" (Colchester 2005:15).

I read the Dayak leader's words as [an **attempt to counter
dispossession by making land inalienable**]{.underline}. It [is **not**
a statement of **what exists**---community control---but a statement of
what **should exist**. It is **framed** as a **restoration** of a
**past** state **before land markets intruded**, **but** the **problem**
of community control **arises only because a land market has, in fact,
intruded**]{.underline}. The leader [notes that people are **forced to
sell land**]{.underline}. [Presumably, these are **farmers** on a
downward spiral, crushed by debt, **who cannot make ends
meet**---classic victims of the "simple reproduction squeeze." **But**
the leader **does not name this problem**. Instead]{.underline}, he
[**wants to govern their conduct** by **punishing them for their
actions** or **encouraging them to make a different choice**.
**Choice**, however, **is a privilege**]{.underline}. Several of the
Dayak leaders interviewed for the report who oppose land selling had
steady incomes from careers as government officials and hence other ways
to raise cash even if their farms did not pay.

Conclusion

In the contemporary period, [[**indigeneity** as a **vehicle** to
**counter dispossession**]{.mark} has had some traction, especially
where it has enabled people to resist large-scale enclosures and mass
eviction. It [has]{.mark} had [**less traction** among **small-scale
farmers**]{.mark}, who are **[eligible]{.mark}** for the special
protections associated with indigeneity **[only if]{.mark}** they [are
**able and willing to conform** to a **model of landholding** that is
**collective and inalienable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Protection and
incarceration are two sides of the same coin]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
I have noted, **[collective landholding is sometimes imposed by a local
group on its own members because they recognize the risk of
dispossession and seek to prevent it. More often, however, it has been
[imposed]{.mark} from outside, first by paternalistic officials of the
colonial period and now [by]{.mark} a new set of experts and [advocates
who assume responsibility for deciding who should and who should not, be
exposed to the risks and opportunities of market
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, from the perspective of
their proponents, attempts to consolidate collective landholdings are
not impositions at all. They simply confirm a culturally distinct
formation naturally present among indigenous people.21 Thus, attempts at
economic governance 21. In Li (2007b), I provide an extensive discussion
of the style of governing that attempts to improve communities by
restoring them to their authentic state. produce a discourse on alterity
that overlooks the dynamics of dispossession---the very same dynamics
that call indigeneity-as-collectivism into being.

[**Like their colonial predecessors, contemporary advocates seeking to
protect indigenous people [do not]{.mark} attempt to [reverse the
dispossessory effects of capitalism overall]{.mark}**.
**[Rather]{.mark}, they seek to erect a wall**]{.underline}---less
extreme than the wall the British built around the Rajmahal Hills, but a
wall nonetheless--- [**guarded by the insistence that indigenous
peoples' landholding is collective and inalienable**. **Such a wall
[leaves the world beyond]{.mark} its boundaries [unchanged and confines
those inside]{.mark} the wall to a set of constraints [many of them
reject]{.mark}, as they have [shown by]{.mark} their [actions over more
than a century]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Just as [some people who
consider themselves indigenous]{.mark} reject individualized tenure,
others **[insist on their right to buy, sell, and mortgage their
land]{.mark}**. This cannot be seen simply as a matter of choice. When
there is a choice, it is **[shaped by]{.mark} a desire and [expectation
that capitalist ag]{.mark}riculture [will produce]{.mark} good returns,
money to educate children, and other [benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
All too often, however, it is a matter of compulsion, as farmers subject
to the "simple reproduction squeeze" do not take loans with
dispossession in mind, only with the desperate need for cash. [Liberal
notions of choice serve to distance would-be governors from the charge
of paternalism, but they bear scant relation to the fierce constraints
of everyday survival]{.underline}. The notion of choice by a
collectivity is still more problematic. Under the UN indigenous rights
regime and the consultation mechanisms of the development banks,
self-determination is indelibly collective. If a group is fractured, or
favours individualized property, or an individual acts alone, indigenous
rights that are contingent on the existence of a collectivity evaporate.

The task of "government," as I have shown, requires a difficult balance
between multiple objectives, and the matter of how to govern in the name
of what set of values or visions of improvement is continuously up for
debate. Anthropologists have played a prominent role in these debates,
especially when they concern the character and capacities of rural
populations, the subject of anthropology's special expertise. At times,
anthropologists have promoted strong concepts of community, indigeneity,
race, or cultural difference, especially when these appeared to have
strategic value in advancing an agenda they support.22 At other times,
anthropologists have worked to loosen the hold of these concepts when
they seemed to be doing harm. An excellent example of this kind of
correction is the essay by Pauline Peters (2004) in which she points out
that the work anthropologists had done in the 1970s and 1980s to
highlight the adaptability of customary property regimes in Africa, a
strategic intervention at a point when these regimes were being
deliberately undermined, had begun to backfire. Authorities with
jurisdiction over land matters began to argue that they did not need to
worry about dispossession because Africans had customary ways of sorting
out land problems among themselves. But the forces producing
dispossession in the African countryside Peters examined in the 1990s
included violent eviction by paramilitaries, land grabbing by
state-linked elites, and the effects of a global price regime that
devastated farm-based livelihoods. No amount of creative adaptation from
below could shield rural people from the effects of these processes,
still less reverse them.

Continuous exposure of the diverse and changing forms of dispossession,
I would like to suggest, is one of the more constructive interventions
anthropologists can make today. Dispossession, to use Gillian Hart's
trenchant phrasing, must be denaturalized (2006). [In addition to the
large-scale enclosures that continue to wreak havoc, as I noted at the
outset, studies of dispossession must include]{.underline} what Mike
Davis (2006:181) calls [the "relentless micro-capitalism" of the poor
that is a pervasive feature of their livelihoods in cities and
countryside alike. They must also attend to the dispossessory and
accumulative practices of "indigenous" elites and "customary"
authorities, whose position was strengthened by colonial indirect rule
and is increasingly entrenched]{.underline}.23 [Though we all live in a
generalized capitalist system, **capitalism** is **not** a **singular
form** or a singular force. It is an assemblage of disparate elements,
practices, and processes each with its own history of violence, law,
hope, and struggle. We **cannot tame it by building walls or wishing it
away**. Rather, we **need to understand how it works** in all its
**dynamic specificity**]{.underline}. This is a field of study to which
anthropologists have much to contribute.

### Link\-\--State Bad

#### The question of this [debate]{.underline} is how we build [power]{.underline} -- all political [actions]{.underline} are defined by our [relation]{.underline} to state resources which are [reallocated]{.underline} by action [within]{.underline} and [against]{.underline} the State -- BUT an [insurgency]{.underline} against [capitalism]{.underline} requires [explicit]{.underline} material strategies to resist [fascist]{.underline} governance

the 21st Century", Palgrave Macmillian, pg. 228-234, 01-16-2017

**[A shortcoming of]{.underline}** the **[theorists]{.underline}**
considered in Chap. 5 **[is the insufficient attention paid to the
state]{.underline}**; **[this reflects]{.underline}**, to a degree,
**[the rejection of the (communist) party]{.underline}**. With the party
spurned, attention moved primarily to social movements, as the state was
no longer viewed as the principal avenue through which to pursue change.
**[The shortcomings of contemporary activism highlight the need to
restore consideration of the state as a conceptual
variable]{.underline}**. As argued in Chap. 4 , the state has continued
to be a major actor in the neoliberal era (despite the reigning doxa).
Poulantzas (see also 1978 , pp. 22--24; ibid, p. 17) held that the state
is always involved in the constitution and reproduction of the relations
of production which, under capitalism, are necessarily exploitative.
**[To understand the capitalist state involves appreciating the conflict
of interests present within]{.underline}** capitalist relations of
production and, by extension, how class struggle is present within these
**[power relations]{.underline}** (ibid. p. 25). **[Social
[struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}** between classes **[[is a "game of
provisional compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[played [on an unstable
field]{.mark}]{.underline}** (ibid, 141)---**[[policies always
reflect]{.mark} the outcome of [strategic
compromises]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Levine 2002 , p. 176). Struggle
occurs between capital and the masses, and also within capital itself
(Poulantzas 1980 , p. 143). The capitalist state needs to represent the
long-term interests of the whole of the bourgeoisie, but does so under
the hegemony of one of its factions (ibid, p. 307). [**The State
organises and** [reproduces **class**]{.mark} hegemony **by establishing
a veritable field of compromises between the dominant and dominated
classes;**]{.underline} quite frequently, [this will even involve the
imposition of certain short-term material sacrifi ces on the dominant
classes, in order that their long-term domination may be reproduced. ...
It should never be **forgotten** that a whole series of economic
measures, particularly **concerning** the expanded reproduction of
labour-power, were imposed on the State by the struggle of the
**dominated classes**]{.underline} . (ibid, p. 184, emphasis in
original) The state is able to secure the long-run hegemony of the
capitalist class by granting certain material demands to the popular
masses. Th ese may, at the time, be quite radical in their import, such
as the provision of universal healthcare or education---but with a
change to the relations of force in favour of the bourgeoisie, such
demands can be covertly stripped of their radical content (ibid. p.
185). [An example is the privatisation of public assets in recent
years]{.underline} (as argued in Chap. 4 ). **[The granting of material
demands to the public is increasingly taking place through the private
sector, reflecting the decline of popular demands aimed at the state
following the defeat of organised labour]{.underline}**. The means of
aligning factions of the working class with bourgeois projects has (as
explored in Chap. 4 ) involved tying them into financial markets through
their pension funds and access to easy credit. The bailout of financial
markets by the state (a move overwhelmingly in the interests of the
capitalist class) could, consequently, be justified to sections of the
working class on the basis that it protected their assets. The play of
compromise, of give and take, which takes place under the auspices of
the state means "the precise configuration of the ensemble of state
apparatuses ... depends not only on the internal relation of force in
the power bloc but also on the role they fulfil in respect to the
dominated classes" (Poulantzas 2008 , p. 311)---a position signalling
Poulantzas' debt to Gramsci ( 1971 , p. 182), who had argued that the
interests of the ... dominant group is coordinated concretely with the
general interests of subordinate groups, and **[the life of [the State
is]{.mark} conceived of as [a continuous process of formation and
superseding of]{.mark} unstable [equilibria]{.mark}]{.underline}** ...
**[between the interests of the fundamental group and those of
subordinate groups]{.underline}**---equilibria in which the interests of
the dominant group prevail, but only up to a certain point. **[The
state]{.underline}**, then, **[needs to be seen as a relation of
forces]{.underline}**---**[it is the material condensation
of]{.underline}** the **[struggle]{.underline}** that takes place among
classes (Poulantzas 1980 , pp. 128--29). No one class ever has complete
control of all state institutions (Bratsis 2002 , p. 259). **[The state
is constituted through]{.underline}**, **[and riven with]{.underline}**,
class **[contradictions]{.underline}**. It must not, therefore, be seen
as monolithic (this being the shortcoming of Badiou's approach to the
state, as explored in Chap. 5 )---class contradictions are present
within the state's material framework and patterns of organisation
(Poulantzas 1980 , p. 134). The rigidity of the state ensures that its
manipulation at the hands of the bourgeois is a slow process (ibid, p.
138). **[Rather than assuming a position that works only against the
state]{.underline}**, as Badiou and Rancière advocate, **[it needs to be
realised that [the state]{.mark}, while rigid, [can be subject to change
from within]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To illustrate the unfixed nature of
the state Poulantzas (ibid, pp. 146--47) offers a "relational theory of
power" as a means of explaining (primarily class) struggle.
**[[Power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he argues, **[is not a quantity or
object; nor is it an essence, or substance]{.underline}**, possessed by
a dominant class. Insofar as power can be held by social classes,
**[it]{.underline}** ... **[[should be understood as the capacity
of]{.mark} one or several [classes to realise]{.mark} their [specific
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is a concept designating the field
of their struggle--- that of the relationship of forces and of the
relations between one class and another. ... The capacity of one class
to realise its interests is in opposition to the capacity (and
interests) of other classes: **[the field of power is therefore strictly
relational]{.underline}**. (ibid, p. 147, emphasis in original) The
**[power]{.underline}** of a class **[is positional]{.underline}** 1
---**[it stems from its objective place in political, economic and
ideological relations]{.underline}**. Each class' position, and **[the
degree of power stemming from]{.underline}** **[holding this
position]{.underline}**, **[is delimited by other classes and/or class
fractions]{.underline}**. "**[Power]{.underline}** ... **[depends
on]{.underline}**, **[and springs from, a relational system of material
places occupied by particular agents]{.underline}**" (ibid, p. 147).
[**[State power]{.underline}**,]{.mark} then, **[[has no intrinsic
essence]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[but is rather the relations of social
classes and forces]{.underline}**. The state itself is the "strategic
site of organisation of the dominant class in its relationship with
dominated classes" (ibid, p. 148). In assessing **[the state
today]{.underline}** it can be seen that the interests of the capitalist
class are paramount, free as they are from any concerted countervailing
pressures---history shows this **[is not an inevitable arrangement. The
relationship between the dominant and dominated]{.underline}** classes
**[is never straightforward]{.underline}**. As the state is a field of
strategic relations, power needs to be seen as mobile, as moving between
apparatuses. Different state institutions house competing/rival class
(or other) social relations (Levine 2002 , p. 176). **[Strategically the
question must always be asked "who is in power to do
what?"]{.underline}** Th e state needs to be comprehended as a complex
with higher (ruling) levels and subordinate levels. **[[The aim]{.mark}
of]{.underline}** Marxist **[political analysis [is to identify]{.mark}
the sites]{.underline}** within this complex **[where real power is
concentrated]{.underline}**---with "real power" denoting, here, **[the
[institutional resources]{.mark} (administration, executive power,
budget]{.underline}**) **[[which allow the social class in power to
maintain their]{.mark} superior [position]{.mark} within political
struggles]{.underline}** (Codato and Perissinotto 2002 , p. 61): prime
examples being the Federal Reserve or central banks which are,
essentially, autonomous institutions, insulated from popular demands, or
the appointment and tenure of Supreme Court judges. **[There
are]{.underline}**, however, **[always opportunities]{.underline}**
**[to tip the balance of powers]{.underline}** one way or
another---**[something]{.underline}** Occupy, with its **[spurning of
the state]{.underline}**, **[failed to take into account]{.underline}**.
If there is no concerted opposition to capitalist rule, then practices
seeking to maintain social cohesion will adhere exclusively to the
interests of the capitalist class---a disorganised working class poses
no threat to the stability of this class: "Although capital may indeed
be able to adjust to the various working-class concessions and even to
an expansion in social-welfare policies, there is no need to do so
without a challenge coming from below" (Levine 2002 , p. 181). Although
the key strategic points within the state are occupied by those who seek
to perpetuate capitalism, **[it would be a mistake]{.underline}**,
argues Poulantzas ( 1980 , p. 153, emphasis in original), **[to cease
conducting struggles within the strategic field of the
state]{.underline}**: We ... know that, alongside their possible
presence in the physical space of the state apparatuses, the popular
masses must constantly maintain and deploy centres and networks at a
distance from these apparatuses: I am referring, of course, to movements
for direct, rank-and-fi le democracy and to self-management networks.
But although these take up **[political objectives]{.underline}**, they
**[are not located outside]{.underline}** the State or, in any case,
outside **[power]{.underline}**--- **[[contrary to]{.mark} the
[simplistic]{.mark} illusions of [anti-institutional
purity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is more, **[[to place
oneself]{.mark} at any cost [outside the State]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the thought that one is thereby situated outside power (which is
impossible) **[[can]{.mark} often be the best means of [leav]{.mark}ing
[the field open for statism]{.mark}]{.underline}** : in short,
**[it]{.underline}** often **[involves [a retreat in the face of the
enemy]{.mark} precisely on this strategically crucial
terrain]{.underline}**. The crucial point here is that **[there is no
"outside" of the state to which movements can
escape]{.underline}**---**[positions can be assumed against the
state]{.underline}** by movements, **[but]{.underline}** these **[need
to be matched by actions within the field of the state]{.underline}** by
actors from the left. In conceptualising how this might be possible
Poulantzas (ibid, p. 256, emphasis in original) sought to pose the
question of democratic socialism anew: How is it possible to radically
transform the state in such a manner that the extension and deepening of
political freedoms and the institutions of representative democracy
(which were all a conquest of the popular masses) are combined with the
unfurling of forms of direct democracy and the mushrooming of
selfmanagement bodies? In seeking an answer to this question it is
important, he cautions, not to follow the "old illusion of anarchism"
that the strategic field of the state can be abandoned. Political
strategy must be grounded in the "autonomy of the organisations of the
popular masses," but their **[autonomy is not founded in some "outside"
space]{.underline}**. Th e popular masses, he argues, can deploy
networks and centres of struggle at a distance from state apparatuses,
but never from outside the state (ibid, p. 153). Th ere can be no simple
opposition between "internal" and "external" struggle; rather, both must
be simultaneously pursued (ibid, p. 260). **[[Successful strategy
entails]{.mark} maintaining [a distance]{.mark} [from the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}** (without imagining an outside),
**[[combined with]{.mark} taking [action within the state]{.mark} to
transform the state]{.underline}** (Thomas 2002 , p. 76). Here lies the
value of recovering Poulantzas' analysis as a means of assessing Occupy.
(I) Th e movement paid insuffi cient attention to the question of class
and of how to foster class-consciousness; the diffuse notion of the
"99%" off ered little strategic value when it came to analysing the
positions held by diff erent factions of the bourgeoisie. Rather,
everyone---excluding a tiny hyper-rich section of the capitalist
elite---were considered to be "in it together"; no distinction was made
between the lower-upper classes, the middle classes and the most
precarious and exploited parts of the populace. Poulantzas emphasised
the need to consider processes of class formation (within exploitative
capitalist relations of production) and of shifting class alliances
(both within and across classes). (II) Th rough rejecting engagement
with the state, Occupy left this "crucial terrain" in the hands of those
whose interests aligned with capital. Individuals and groups positioned
within the field of the state may have been sympathetic to the
movement's aims, but they were denied the popular support needed to
manoeuvre effectively within the state. Poulantzas emphasised the need
to analyse the state---to find the positions class blocs held within its
apparatuses to bolster their power---to identify the strategic lines of
engagement through which to challenge entrenched power. Th rough
rejecting the state, Occupy hewed closely to the approach advocated by
Hardt and Negri (and by anarchism more generally), an approach that has
proven time and again inadequate to enact substantive enduring change.
**[Effective action takes place both within and against the
state]{.underline}**. To turn to the other theorists considered earlier,
the approach advocated by Badiou and Rancière---to make "impossible"
demands against the state---complements Laclau and Mouff e's calls to
form a popular movement capable of radicalising representative
democracy. When viewed from a slight remove, a field of tensions can be
seen in which the left is active. Th e extra-parliamentary left
radicalises the parliamentary left---movements need parties to secure
victories, and parties need movements if they are to follow a radical
line and deepen democracy. **[[The distinction between reform and
revolution sloughs away.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Assuming such a position
requires, however, an acknowledgment that the state cannot be abandoned,
and that capital must be opposed---such is the corrective Poulantzas
provides to contemporary left theory. Movements and Parties Much has
happened since Poulantzas' death. As shown in Part I of this work,
**[[the]{.mark} organised [working class has been
defeated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[unions are weak, social democratic
parties have]{.mark} completely [capitulated to
capital]{.mark}]{.underline}** and any remaining communist parties have
low memberships and/or have morphed into social democratic parties in
all but name. **[The doctrines of [neoliberalism dominate]{.mark} the
political, economic and [social spheres]{.mark}, [fostering an ethos of
individualism]{.mark} that serves [as a barrier to collective
action]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The difficulties faced by
Occupy]{.underline}**, as traced in Part II of this work,
**[are]{.underline}** **[symptomatic of the wider issues faced by the
left today]{.underline}**, namely: **[a lack of coherent
strategy]{.underline}**, the absence of a strong collective identity
**[and an inability to secure substantive victories]{.underline}**. Th e
left is weak. A politics without the state, party, class or overarching
"grand historical narrative" to guide action has been tried and
failed---Occupy presents the latest and most vivid example of this
failure. Th e turn taken by the new left and new social movements in the
late 1960s was important, insofar as it overcame the chauvinism of the
old left, but it has reached a dead end.

### Alt\-\--Black Maoism

#### The alternative is to embrace communist party organizing rooted in black Maoist thought. We endorse a scientific approach to revolutionary study that learns from past mistakes to strengthen the battle against racial capitalism. 

**Williams 18** (Carine Williams; 7-30-18; "Why Black People Need Maoism

When they hear Maoism, many people think of China, Peru, and the
Philippines. They picture peasants \"surrounding the cities from the
countryside.\" This is, of course, understandable, but a mistake.
[Maoism is not simply \"everything that Mao did,\" or \"everything that
happened in China between 1949 and now.\"]{.underline} I have spent a
great deal of my time writing working to dispel these sorts of myths,
some peddled in an unprincipled fashion by anti-Maoists. [**Maoism is a
living, breathing science.** By science we mean **something with
universal principles that can be taken and applied by all who have a
material interest in making revolution.**]{.underline} In the United
States, this is Black people, or the New Afrikan nation.

It [was not by accident that the original **Black Panther
Party**]{.underline} (BPP) [**developed close relations with** the
revolutionary leadership of the People\'s Republic of **China.** **Huey
didn\'t go to China to play; he went to study** and learn things that
could be applied back home.]{.underline} Of course, he eventually
degenerated in political line and practice, taking a right opportunist
course along with Bobby Seale (always a centrist) and Elaine Brown (who
guided the party, in his absence, into a mainstream political force that
led into the arms of the Democratic Party). This opportunism in the
highest expression of revolutionary sentiment, practice, and force in
this country to date needs to be studied and ruthlessly criticized, yet
we should be careful. [We must place things in their historical context
and ensure that we are able to divide one into two, meaning see the
beneficial as well as the negative aspects of a thing but also realize
that one aspect must be primary.]{.underline}

[**The BPP was destroyed by a** combination of factors: **lack of** a
really **scientific method of analysis and cohesive program of political
education**, failure to promote and apply the Marxist-Leninist principle
of Democratic Centralism]{.underline} ([debate inside the party,
formation of a political line through this debate, and the upholding of
this decision by all party members and organs]{.underline}), [and a
culture of liberalism that ended with comrades fighting comrades, thus
opening the door for external factors]{.underline} (the FBI and other LE
agencies) [to play havoc and get cadre railroaded into prison and
killed. **We must study and learn all of these lessons**, because when
we develop another organization with the prestige, mass base, and power
that the Panthers had, and we will, they will come for us all
again.]{.underline}

So, why do we need Maoism? Because [**we are against the most brutal**,
bloody, and vicious **empire known to humankind. This country is looting
and enslaving our class siblings all over the world.** To overturn this
order of things, to smash it and rebuild it in the interests of the
revolutionary proletariat of the entire world, **we must apply the
synthesis of 200 years of systematic, organized class struggle, which is
Marxism-Leninism-Maoism**: the continuity of the revolutionary project
that was Marxism-Leninism, with a rupture from the dogmatism and
revisionism.]{.underline} Maoists do not uphold \"Actually Existing
Socialism\" because a scientific analysis rooted in the principles laid
down by the revolutionary movements and projects that gave us Marx,
Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao would demonstrate that stealing food from
Filipino fisherfolk, like the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) has been
doing, is 100% non-Marxist. This is in disagreement with many
Marxist-Leninist organizations today, which uphold these things and
other imperialist depredations carried out under the faded red banner of
China.

[The Maoist argument is that Marxist-Leninist terrain has been spent,
and the 21st century must learn from Maoism]{.underline}. \"You haven\'t
seized state power yet!\" others cry. Indeed, and there has never been a
truly Maoist party that has initiated armed struggle in the imperialist
metro poles. This doesn\'t mean that Maoist principles cannot be applied
to these countries, this means that [we must be ever more creative in
our application and ever more disciplined in our party-building efforts.
**Party building** in the USA **requires the careful and thorough
cultivation of a mass base.**]{.underline} Tens of thousands, even
[hundreds of thousands]{.underline}, [of people must depend on and
follow this party and participate in mass organizations before it can
even begin to call itself a vanguard.]{.underline} This is what many who
came out of the New Communist Movement of the mid-late 1970s failed to
realize. [The days of **endless squabbling** sects that fight over
\"mass bases\" of a handful of other activists **must be put to an end,
and we must have a truly mass perspective.**]{.underline}

[There is optimism in the spread of **For the People**]{.underline}
(FTP) [**organizations** and the development of the Org**anizing
Committee for a Maoist Communist Party **]{.underline}(MCP-OC) [which
has a more mass orientation and **places primacy on the development of a
class analysis and political line** in the USA that is **based in
painstaking investigation and rooted in the aspirations and struggles of
the most oppressed, along with a record of seeking to develop
international solidarity and prison work.** This]{.underline}, I
believe, [is the best hope for New Afrikan Maoists]{.underline} in the
United States [and I wholeheartedly encourage Black comrades to develop
FTP-type organizations in their own communities]{.underline} under OC
guidance. Even if this isn\'t done, at the very least [**studies in
Maoism**, studies in Maoist revolutions, and studies in Maoist theory
are **beneficial.** After and during these studies, think about how it
can be applied on your block and in your community.]{.underline}

Learn about and be like Fred Hampton. [Time is up for spinning our
wheels; **we must get together, unite on a principled and unshakeable
basis, and mount a formidable resistance against decades and
centuries-old oppression based in capitalism and white
supremacy.**]{.underline} I also encourage support and donation to the
Hampton Institute as an invaluable resource in promoting revolutionary
ideology and practice in the finest Marxist tradition.

#### We can't 'do both.'

Melissa **Naschek 18**, Co-Chair of the Philadelphia Democratic
Socialists of America, 8/28/18, "The Identity Mistake,"
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/mistaken-identity-asaid-haider-review-identity-politics.

[[We Can't "Do Both"]{.mark}]{.underline} Today, with the popularity of
Bernie Sanders and a resurgence in trade union activity, [[circumstances
are]{.mark} finally re-[emerging for]{.mark} a political program capable
of fostering **[mass working-class solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Instead, [[Haider]{.mark} [would have us turn to]{.mark}]{.underline}
the model that has failed the working class for years: [**[rhetorically
accepting identity-based particularism]{.mark}** at the implicit expense
of class-based universalism]{.underline}. [Of course, [Haider]{.mark}
does not overtly suggest]{.underline} that [this is an
either/or]{.underline}. Instead, **[he [insists that we must do
both]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- working-class politics and identity
politics. [[**But "doing both" is easier said than done**. Identity
politics and class politics understand capitalist power structures in
**distinct ways** and]{.mark} therefore [lead to **distinct
political**]{.mark} **[strategies]{.mark}**. More
importantly]{.underline}, however, "[[doing both" misreads the balance
of power]{.mark} in America]{.underline} today: [institutionally [on the
Left,]{.mark} we have nothing but a fraction of the already miniscule
labor movement to back our platform]{.underline} and our analysis. [But
liberalism has a major political party,]{.underline} the
[media]{.underline}, [academia]{.underline}, and [the entire world of
nonprofits]{.underline}, which today controls about as much wealth as
the Church did before the French Revolution. And [[**it's in the "do
both" strategy** that]{.mark} these [**powerful enemies of the Left**
(and **allies of capital**]{.mark}) worm their way into our coalition
[and play up identity to reshape working-class demands until]{.mark}
they're **[neutralized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Haider fails to recognize
the profound asymmetry between the power of institutions of the
working-class and the advocates of universal class-based reforms, and
those of the liberal establishment and their own embrace of
identity-based particularism. [Concretely, this asymmetry does not lead
to the best of identity politics and the best of universal demands in
some sort of synthesis]{.underline}. Instead, [the lopsided advocacy for
[particularist demands serves only to **further marginalize the
universalist demands**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An [anticapitalist
politics]{.underline} capable of fighting against such forces [must
appeal to the whole working class to build a mass movement.
Masses]{.underline} of people [become interested]{.underline} in
politics [when organizations offer a real possibility to change their
lives for the better. The only way to forge a movement capable
of]{.underline} achieving [that is by fighting for shared working-class
political and economic interests]{.underline}. This remains the only
plausible path to harnessing the only power offered to workers in
society: their position as an exploited majority. [The good news
is]{.underline} that the [needs for affordable medical care, a livable
planet, quality education, and respect and security in the workplace
satisfy such a mandate]{.underline}. It is two of Mistaken Identity's
supposed interlocutors, Barbara J. Fields and Karen Fields, who note
that [[downplaying class demands "is a **devastatin**]{.mark}**g,
intolerable [mistake]{.mark}**[. It **leads people to say that race is
fundamental**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- not economics, not class ---
[[and if you bring class in]{.mark} then you're trying [to deny]{.mark}
the reality of human existence and [identity. That is]{.mark} the **big
[mystification]{.mark}** achieved by racecraft]{.underline}."

#### Recognizing class as central to oppression is a prior question\-\--that's key to international solidarity against capital, toward climate justice. 

**Bedford 24 --** Laura Bedford is a Senior Lecturer in Criminology

[The working class remains the 'biggest threat to capital today' and
this 'is true both in the advanced capitalist countries themselves and
even more so in the periphery, where the working class overlaps with the
dispossessed peasantry.]{.underline} The working class is most powerful
when able to combine with other subaltern classes as part of a hegemonic
bloc led by workers' (Foster, 2019, p 6). **[[The challenge is]{.mark}
to overcome]{.underline}** the mediated, [constructed and entrenched
divisions]{.underline} in relation to gender, race, class and religion;
**[[to see class as central]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Certainly, as
Canadian sociologist and unionist Kevin MacKay argues:

> [Radically [transforming]{.mark} industrial, [capitalist
> civilization]{.mark} won't be easy. It [will require movements for
> environmental sustainability, social justice, and economic fairness
> to]{.mark} come together, and to realize their common interest in
> dismantling the system of oligarchy and **[build]{.mark}ing [a
> democratic, eco-socialist society.]{.mark}**]{.underline} This
> 'movement of movements' must put aside sectarian squabbles, and
> finally realize that the goals of economic justice, human rights, and
> ecological sustainability are all intrinsically linked. (MacKay, 2018,
> para 18)

[Young people in each generation]{.underline} have always led the way
when it comes to delimiting the boundaries of political activism and
resistance tactics. In a break with this historical role of young
people, I argue, [**[highly curated climate protests]{.mark}** in the
economic core may serve to [relieve]{.mark} the worst symptoms of the
[cognitive dissonance]{.mark} the protesters feel, [but **do they
constitute action for change?** When]{.mark} young [people direct their
anger to the spectre of climate change]{.mark} and so-called 'corporate
greed' -- corporations are fine, just not greedy ones -- the meaning of
activism and [resistance]{.mark} as revolutionary praxis [becomes
misdirected.]{.mark} This is because [rather than seeing
themselves]{.mark} as resisting oppression or [acting in
solidarity]{.mark} with oppressed groups, **[they only imagine
themselves as needing to be heard]{.mark}.**]{.underline} As Paulo
Freire reminds us, [the oppressed]{.underline} 'whose task it is to
struggle for their liberation together with those who show true
solidarity, [must acquire a critical awareness of oppression through the
praxis of this struggle']{.underline} (2005 \[1970\], p 51). [To
overcome oppression and 'turn upon it ... can be done only by means of
the praxis: reflection and action upon the world in order to transform
it']{.underline} (Freire, 2005, p 51). [Acting on climate change is like
shadow boxing. [Climate change is a symptom of a sick system]{.mark}; it
cannot be fought in any way other than directly challenging the system
that gives rise to it.]{.underline} Even though reducing atmospheric
carbon pollution at the speed required to prevent planetary catastrophe
is increasingly unlikely, [[planetary justice]{.mark} is impossible
without understanding the nature of the fight.]{.underline}

[The nature of the fight will [only be realized through global
solidarity]{.mark} and the praxis of radical change making.]{.underline}
Given the doublespeak and hypocrisy of our current so-called leadership,
at the very least, [the citizens -- and certainly [activists]{.mark} --
in counties [in the economic core]{.mark} that benefit from past and
present genocide, ecocide and theft on an unimaginable scale around the
world can do is acknowledge this past and its present
manifestations.]{.underline} Beyond this, [if they wish to be part of
the revolutionary change, they [will need to act in the interests of the
working class]{.mark}, landless peasants, subsistence farmers and
Indigenous peoples -- [against capital.]{.mark}]{.underline} In so
doing, they may reveal their own status as members of an oppressed
class. [Environmental and climate movements in the economic core will --
unless they act in solidarity with class-based movements and those
struggling on the ecological frontline against enclosure, environmental
racism and repression -- make themselves effectively irrelevant, even
though their activism garners undue media attention at home due to their
privileged position]{.underline} and white supremacy.

[Ordinary people in the economic core and peripheries are increasingly
aware of the cause of their exploitation and that of the
planet.]{.underline} Wherever they are in the world, in villages in the
Sundarbans, townships and informal settlements in South Africa or New
York City, [people, acting in solidarity, can -- **if they are acting
collectively** -- challenge capital.]{.underline} Yet [to do so, [we
must]{.mark} name and [act upon the system]{.mark} of oppression
clearly, **[not cravenly gesture towards climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, 'human agents can of course
change their social worlds for the better, as long as they are actually
acting on real underlying forces, processes and structures rather than
simply gesturing toward them' (Winlow and Hall, 2016, p 88). [The
important thing then, about praxis is that it requires action directed
at the real cause of alienation and exploitation, not causes that are
socially constructed.]{.underline} However, [it is only through the
experiential process of revolutionary praxis that oppressed and
exploited people can change both their conditions of exploitation and
**develop class consciousness**]{.underline} -- that is, realize that
they are oppressed as a class. The one change does not precede the other
(Bedford, 2022). At the same time, as Kovel argues:

> **[[Eco-socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}** is no more a purely economic
> matter than was socialism or communism in the eyes of Marx. It [[needs
> to be precisely the radical transformation of
> society]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and human existence -- that Marx
> envisioned as the next stage in human evolution. Indeed, it must be
> that if we are going to survive the ecological crisis. (2007, p 1)

[The 'climate movement'-mediated protests that have been established to
'fight climate change' aim to raise awareness of impending catastrophe
and demand that politicians respond to 'citizens assemblies' to use
their influence and policy to make capitalists in the economic core more
responsive to the climate crisis.]{.underline} Yet the movement is at an
impasse unless it acts in solidarity with movements that are aimed at
decolonization and dismantling state repression. **[A climate movement
that does not seek to highlight the systemic and structural antecedents
of the climate crisis -- capitalism -- is missing the
point.]{.underline}** [Capitalism cannot be reformed or degrown through
policy mechanisms; it can only shape shift.]{.underline} Our current
political systems, both national and international, under capitalism are
not democracies but plutarchies. [Imperialism is integral to the
international capitalist mode of production, and decolonization is
therefore not possible under global capitalism. [It is not up to any
self-proclaimed 'climate movement' to define the boundary of ethical
tactics]{.mark}, especially a movement that eschews political discussion
and debate and holds nonviolence (of the privileged)
sacred.]{.underline} Instead, **[people themselves will mobilize based
on their real material circumstances in myriad ways that suit their
material conditions.]{.underline}**

While on the one hand [in the economic core, there is limited solidarity
with the international working class or peasantry]{.underline} and
**['it is clear that the current [struggles in the West are occurring
without any interest in what is]{.mark} happening elsewhere in the
world]{.underline}** ... [This is not the least of the successes of the
dictatorship of the oligarchies and the use they make of their media
clergy']{.underline} (Amin, 2016, p 8). As Gramscian scholar Peter
Thomas notes, 'without the elaboration of its own philosophy, or
concrete conception of the world elaborated in institutions adequate to
the specificity of its own project, the movement of the oppressed and
exploited classes of capitalist society will remain subaltern to the
existing dominant conception of the world' (2009, p 452). On the other
hand, [the oppressed classes are already mobilizing on the frontlines of
the ecological war around the world through movements that challenge
racist oppression and state violence]{.underline}, such as millions
marching under the banner Black Lives Matter, and through union
mobilization such as the marches of millions taking place across the UK
and Europe in 2023 protesting against the erosions of workers' rights
and social benefits. [These protests are much larger and have broader
bases than those that have characterized the climate movement in the
economic core, despite claims by the green capitalist environmental
movement to mass mobilization. In the act of mobilizing to resist
against the common enemy -- capitalism -- people will drive forward deep
transformation, but it will not take the form of a 'climate movement'. A
multiplicity of tactics should be welcome, but [the specific tactics
will be determined by the exploited classes themselves,]{.mark} the
landed and landless peasants, Indigenous peoples, the wage slaves, the
unemployed, underemployed and precariously employed working
class.]{.underline}

### K\-\--1NC

#### Understanding historical oppression through a lens of [human commonality]{.underline} creates collective subjectivities that prevent [extinction]{.underline}.

**Al-Nakib, 19**---associate professor of postcolonial studies and
comparative literature at Kuwait University (Mai, "Finding Common
Cause," Interventions, August 5, 2019, dml)

It is the beginning of Spivak's planetarity (2003, 72) and Gilroy's
planetary **[[humanism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (2005, 4). To become
"planetary subjects rather than global agents"
[[involves]{.underline}]{.mark} reckoning with the planet as alterity,
as an impossible other, and \-- always at the same time \-- as a part of
ourselves (Spivak 2003, 73). As Spivak explains: "The planet is in the
species of alterity, belonging to another system; and yet we inhabit it,
on loan" (72). Planetarity \-- whether in the practice of comparative
literary scholarship, pedagogy, or (especially) ethical and ecological
living \-- transgresses normative oppositions (outer\--inner,
continuous\--discontinuous) coextensive with capitalist globalization
(72\--73). It offers, alternatively, an "uncanny", "defamiliarized",
"preemergent", "(im)possibl\[e\]" view of what life on Earth could
become (74, 77, 80, 72). Gilroy \-- who similarly considers the
development of planetary humanism to be contingent upon the experience
of "estrangement from one's own culture and history" (2005, 67) \--
connects the development of planetary humanism to ["a **deliberate
[engagement]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the **twentieth century's [histories
of suffering]{.mark}**" in order [to "**furnish resources** for]{.mark}
the **peaceful [accommodation]{.mark} of otherness** [in relation to
**fundamental commonality**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (4). Gilroy describes
[this **fundamental commonality**]{.underline} as part of a
"cosmopolitan conviviality" (8), which [can emerge]{.underline},
potentially, [in]{.underline} multicultural [[societies]{.mark} that
have **[worked through]{.mark} the [racist]{.mark} suffering**,
**[violence]{.mark}**, and **damage** historically produced by
Empire]{.underline} (99). [This historical reckoning]{.underline} by
western imperial centres [is]{.underline}, for Gilroy, [an
**indispensable component** of overcoming "**postcolonial melancholia**"
[toward]{.mark} the production of **[convivial]{.mark} multicultural
[relations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (98\-- 106). It is the kind of
historical reckoning the doors in Exit West produce by force; and [the
**convivial life** and **planetary potential** that unfolds as a result
of **ordinary encounters with otherness**]{.underline} \-- as
demonstrated in Mykonos, London, and Marin County \-- is the kind of
common cosmopolitanism Gilroy envisions (67). Mohsin Hamid's Exit West
\-- like numerous other, formally experimental works of anticolonial or
postcolonial fiction \-- provides an imaginative cartography of the
"what could happen if". His speculative response in his speculative
novel is "aspirational", but it [is neither **impossible to achieve**
nor **idealist in conception**]{.underline} (Gandhi 2014, 165\--166). To
argue that fictional speculation can play no role in realpolitik is to
foreclose in advance a range of discursive responses that might, in
practice, produce more ethical outcomes than those that have unravelled
in recent years. To argue that fictional speculation is idealist betrays
a reductive understanding of what constitutes materiality.18 As Hamid's
novel so vividly illustrates, [it is]{.underline} the imagined made real
\-- by way of [[**human connection**, **overlapping experiences**,
**common causes**]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- [that [makes possible]{.mark}
**responses other than fear** and **[outcomes not]{.mark} automatically
[violent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The ahimsaic counter-askesis of Hamid's
novel of migratory passage unfolds an inclusionary ethics of "live and
let live" [[rather than the]{.mark} **exclusionary [dogma]{.mark}** [of
"**kill or be killed**",]{.mark} currently [driving]{.mark} **so many
[global antagonisms]{.mark}**. A **global politics**]{.underline}
informed by Hamid's fictional experiments [may prove **messy** at first,
**difficult to coordinate** or even to **stomach**. But]{.underline},
ultimately, [[it may produce]{.mark} the kind of [inhabitants
who]{.mark}]{.underline}, at the very least, [**[work together]{.mark}
soberly** [to ensure]{.mark} the **[sustainability]{.mark} of the planet
we all share in common** and [without which we become
**extinct**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Instead, we should mobilize collective commitments towards humanist futures\-\--that's necessary to avert extinction.

Today [the world seems]{.underline} profoundly [broken]{.underline}.
Decades of endemic financial crisis and stagnant real wages have
produced **[planetary [inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}** of such
magnitude that eight white men now own the same wealth as the poorest
half of the world's population (Oxfam, 2017). Seemingly **[nihilistic
[armed conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}** engulf many regions of world,
contributing to a reality in which one in every hundred people on the
planet lives as a refugee (Connor and Krogstad, 2016). It is now
ninety-five percent likely that temperatures will rise above the
two-degree Celsius threshold, making the most dangerous effects of
global **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely inevitable
(Raftery et al., 2017). And this does not even include the success of
**[[racist, alt-right]{.mark}, and fascist
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline}** across the United States, Europe, and
elsewhere. [All this at a time when **governments** and]{.underline}
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the world [[seem]{.mark}
completely [**ill-equipped** to]{.mark} even [begin engaging]{.mark} the
issues central to **[human survival]{.mark}**. [This]{.mark} brave new
world is not]{.underline} only profoundly [dispiriting, it
[poses]{.mark}]{.underline} very serious [[challenges to]{.mark} those
whose academic and political practice involves critically engaging the
world with the aim of crafting the [**theoretical**
tools]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [or, as]{.underline} Amílcar
**[Cabral]{.underline}** (1979) [might]{.underline} [suggest,
weapons]{.underline} \-- [needed to change it]{.underline}. Today, the
academic workbench of concepts, [theories, and analysis seems **woefully
[inadequate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} honestly [stare into the
abyss]{.underline} before us, [much less [provide]{.mark} meaningful
**[guidance for]{.mark} systemic [transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
One reason for the considerable gulf between available theories and
present political realities stems from the fact that much of the
intellectual tradition structuring the academy today was built alongside
imperial or liberal political and historical trajectories. Many of the
cherished thinkers we draw upon to construct the contemporary political
imaginaries were often coconspirators in the solidification of the
European state system and Western imperialism. During the twentieth
century, theorists engaged in celebrating a politics of mass
demonstration and deliberation, social movements, democratization, and
post-Cold War cosmopolitan civil society. The theoretical lessons
learned from these historical moments now seem either complicit in, or
overly stressed by, the weight of the current pressures. Similarly, many
of the political and theoretical apparatuses used to critique
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} history pale in the face of a historical
[[moment]{.underline}]{.mark} that seems to
[[demand]{.underline}]{.mark} a [renewed]{.underline} militancy of
purpose, a [willingness to take risks for [**justice**, and]{.mark} the
urgent need for]{.underline} even more vibrant and vital networks of
**[human [solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is not surprising,
therefore, that within the current conjuncture political thinkers in the
Western academy have begun returning to the shelves of the African
anticolonial archive (for example: el-Malik and Kamola, 2017; Phạm and
Shilliam, 2016; el-Malik, 2016). [The twentieth-century
[struggles]{.mark} against colonialism in Africa, the African diaspora,
and around the world]{.underline}, seem to once again speak in
instructive and unexpected ways. There is good reason for this return.
These voices [[are]{.mark} poetic yet strident, theoretical but
**[immediately practical]{.mark}** to the particularities of
struggle.]{.underline} These [[writings on]{.mark} colonialism, race,
class, violence, and [governance avoid **abstract
musing**]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- and the polish and perfection of
argument that goes along with it. Instead, they are timely statements
made with great urgency. [The assumed audience of African anticolonial
thought was often not scholars, but]{.underline} rather one's immediate
and [intimate comrades. The horizons of these texts and arguments often
contain futures filled with possibility]{.underline}, even if the
specific outlines are not entirely discernable in the present moment.
Several recent books have argued, in different ways, that returning to
thinkers of African anticolonial struggle greatly enriches the
theoretical understandings and political struggles of the present. Gary
Wilder's Freedom Time: Negritude, Decolonization, and the Future of the
World (2015), Robbie Shilliam's The Black Pacific: Anti-Colonial
Struggles and Oceanic Connections (2015), and Achille Mbembe's Critique
of Black Reason (2017) all make the compelling argument that the [ideas,
concepts, and modes of [argument]{.mark} developed [during anticolonial
struggles]{.mark} in Africa and by the African diaspora are uniquely
suited to help make sense of \-- and [intervene in]{.mark}to \-- [the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike previous debates about 'African
philosophy' or the popular turn towards 'comparative' or 'global'
political theory, these three authors neither seek to 'bring' black and
African voices 'into' an academic field; nor do they take anticolonial
thought as confined to a location, limited to specific set of
'problems', or focused exclusively on the aim of national independence.
Instead, Wilder, Shilliam, and Mbembe treat the work of anticolonialism
as a human inheritance, one that transcends time and space. Wilder, for
example, clearly states that he is less interested in
'provincializ\[ing\] Europe' than in working to 'deprovincialize Africa
and the Antilles' (p. 10). To do so, he tackles the political and
intellectual work of [Aimé [**Césaire** and]{.mark} Léopold Sédar
**[Senghor]{.mark}** in ways that force attention to their broader
[**commitment** to]{.mark}]{.underline} articulating a post-national
(and post-continental) [[**human** politics, as a]{.mark} radical
[critique of]{.mark} Western [modernity rather than]{.mark} the
[**limited** plotting of]{.mark} national independence or a
[black]{.mark} **political [identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly,
Shilliam foregrounds the epistemic and manifest networks through which
the liberatory desires embedded within black power movements and
RasTafari spiritual practices circulated among religious, activist, and
youth communities in Aotearoa (New Zealand) and beyond. Mbembe also
rejects the compartmentalization of 'Africa' from the world,
demonstrating that the racialized practices and knowledges once used to
justify the colonization of Africa have become widely generalized beyond
race. The political and epistemic practices that used 'Black' and
'Africa' as references to concoct racialized categories have become
universalized beyond race. These authors share a commitment to rereading
African peoples, practices, and thought \-- especially as they relate to
the refusal of the Western modern and colonial project \-- as central to
understanding the contemporary condition. They contextualize
anticolonial thinkers within their specific conjuncture, while taking
care not to reduce their arguments to these temporal and spatial
contexts. This work short-circuits the all-to-common assumption that the
anticolonial project is a finished \-- or largely failed \-- project.
However, rather than rebutting such accusations, Wilder's Freedom Time
gracefully argues that such claims are only relevant if one assumes that
Césaire and Senghor, the two protagonists of his book, were primarily
concerned with ending colonial rule within particular geographical
spaces. Wilder argues that contemporary readers often miss the fact that
[these two thinkers [understood]{.mark} their complex intellectual and
political projects as engaged in [a **wholesale rebuilding** of]{.mark}
modern **[humanity]{.mark}**]{.underline} beyond the nation-state. As
such, the work of Césaire and Senghor should not be understood through
the lens of national independence, but rather read for the
not-yet-realized political visions they contain. Wilder writes:
'Scholarship long promoted one-sided understandings of Césaire and
Senghor as either essentialist nativists or naïve humanists...Negritude,
whether embraced or criticized, was treated as an affirmative theory of
Africanity rather than a critical theory of modernity' (p. 8). Wilder
argues instead that Césaire and Senghor actually reject 'the doxa that
self-determination required state sovereignty' and instead proceeded
from a position that 'colonial peoples cannot presume to know a priori
which political arrangements would best allow them to pursue substantive
freedom' (p. 2). In this way, [Césaire and Senghor were intellectuals
who lived as complex and fluid thinkers engaged in a '[pragmatic
orientation]{.mark}' that '[was inseparable from]{.mark} a **utopian
[commitment]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **political [imagination]{.mark}** and
anticipatory politics]{.underline} through which they hoped to transcend
the very idea of France, remake the world, and inaugurate a new epoch of
human history' (p. 2). This requires understanding Césaire and Senghor
as practicing a form of thinking that is simultaneously 'strategic and
principled, gradualist and revolutionary, realist and vision, timely and
untimely' (p. 2). Wilder's book alternates chapters between [Césaire and
Senghor]{.underline}, tracing the evolution, exchange, and collaboration
between these two intellectuals, as well as tracing how their ideas
evolved over the course of their engagement with party and state
politics. Reading these texts as already instantiated within a political
terrain makes it possible to grasp their full nuance. For example, in a
chapter on Senghor's African socialism, Wilder writes that Senghor
'called neither for France to decolonize Africa nor for Africa to
liberate itself, but for Africans to decolonize France' (p. 214). To
this end, African socialism was not simply a political platform, or an
effort to remake Marxist theory, but rather a way of imagining the world
that [left open the possibility that Africans were the agents [of
'**planetary salvation**']{.mark} and 'human emancipation']{.underline}
(p. 215). This approach helps explain the seemingly quixotic political
commitment that Senghor held concerning regional federalism and his
insistence on maintaining a fraternal relationship between Senegal and
France (two political positions often cited as evidence of his inability
to uphold the true promise of national independence). Instead, Wilder
suggests that thinking 'with Césaire and Senghor' requires us to
'engag\[e\] a future that might have been'. While the specific
conclusions Césaire and Senghor arrive at might not necessarily 'be
applied to our times', 'the problems they identified' still 'persist',
and their 'utopian realist thinking, at once concrete and
world-historical, still resonates' (p. 256).

#### Vote neg to center [radical humanism]{.underline} as a [horizon]{.underline} for critical practice.

**Banerjee, 20**---assistant professor in the program on Science,
Technology, and Society at MIT (Dwaipayan, "Anthropology's Reckoning
with Radical Humanism," Anthropology Now, Volume 12, Issue 3, 2020, pp.
50-55, dml)

If [we are turning toward **radical humanism**]{.underline}, we must be
clear that we are turning toward it **[again]{.underline}**, [[in the
wake of its]{.underline}]{.mark} spectacular [[**failures**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}** by the
postwar liberal settlement. In a now famous essay, Edward [**Said**
posed the question of how theories **travel**]{.underline}: "[What
happens to it when]{.underline}, [in different circumstances and for new
reasons]{.underline}, [it is used **again** and]{.underline}, in still
more different circumstances, [**again**?]{.underline} What can this
tell us about theory itself---its limits, its possibilities, its
inherent problem ...?"Footnote6 This question resonates here: [[radical
humanism has **recurred**]{.mark} as a response to varying sets of
circumstances]{.underline}; what does it mean to resurrect it now? And
why resurrect it at all, when we seem to be approaching something like a
resolution to the question---a present anthropological reaching toward
the post- or even trans-human?

In the heady years right after decolonization, anticolonial insurgents
asked themselves the same question. This curious fact never ceases to
amaze me: [at precisely the moment the violence of humanism had been
**revealed** and **defeated**]{.underline}, [those that felt its
violence sought its **resurrection**]{.underline}. The list is long:
C.L.R. James, W.E.B. Dubois, Frantz Fanon, B.R. Ambedkar, Aimé Césaire,
Léopold Senghor, Edward Said, M.N. Roy, to name just a few. Roy was
perhaps the first to have self-consciously developed the term and its
philosophy. After having founded both the Mexican Communist Party and
instrumental in the development of the Indian Communist Party, late in
his life Roy turned away from his communist roots and toward a theory of
radical humanism.

Roy began a trend that has so far been underthought: radical humanism
often appeared at the end of its proponents' lives: as
fighter-philosophers (Fanon and Said are other prominent examples) chose
to leave us with this philosophical legacy. One might easily critique
radical humanism as a philosophy that seems to appear in old age, as
revolutionary fire gives way to reconciliation, often in view of the
failures of socialist projects in the mid-20th century. But it is
precisely against this idea of old age as a moment of settlement that
Said militates. He asks, what if we abandon the common notion that old
age demands a spirit of resolution and compromise and instead take the
opposite approach: that artistic lateness disavows easy resolutions in
favor of intransigence, difficulty and contradiction? To me, it is
precisely [this intransigence]{.underline} that [gives radical humanism
its **force**]{.underline}: [its **unrelenting commitment** to a
humanism **rethought** from the point of view of its **greatest
failure**]{.underline}, [even as all hope for the concept **seems
lost**]{.underline}. It is [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} same
intransigence that [[draws me]{.underline}]{.mark} to Uberoi: [[to
**rethink**]{.mark} European [modernity from]{.mark} the point of view
of [the **colonized**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [trying to **rescue Europe
from itself** even as it hurtles down the path of its own
**unraveling**]{.underline}.

To be more specific about this politics of refusal, let me turn to one
of its strongest exponents---Frantz Fanon. Fanon's work makes clear that
this new humanism was not to a slight tweak to its older form: the
psychic violence of colonization did not leave the colonized with any
easy entryway to the category of humanness. Put differently, by the
mid-20th century, liberal humanism had already succeeded in its project
to dehumanize the colonized; decolonization had come too late. [The
victory of [liberal humanism]{.mark} was that it had [**set the terms**
of what]{.mark} now [counted as human]{.mark}]{.underline}---calmness
without anger, rationality freed from belief, progress without
reparation. Fanon thus recognized that the struggle had not ended but
only just begun. What then did a radical reconceptualization of humanism
look like for Fanon? [[Radical humanism]{.mark} was a way to continue
the anticolonial project **without** simply adopting]{.underline} the
[**false** humanisms]{.underline} of contemporaneous socialism (the
French and Russian, in this case). Fanon's [decolonial humanism demanded
a **permanent revolution**]{.underline}, one [that [would **never fall
prey** to the false belief that the project]{.mark} of humanism [could
be **resolved**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Radical humanism]{.underline}
then [was [not a **method** but a]{.mark} **political [horizon]{.mark}**
[and a]{.mark} **revolutionary-critical
[practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To return then to the idea of whether theories appropriate to one place
can and should travel, and what they reveal in their traveling. As Gili
Kilger puts it, this new humanism "did not involve an effort to expand
black subjectivity into a wider, universal subject, which would have
done no more than reinstate this new subject on the grounds of the
old."Footnote7 Rather, it was predicated on overturning a humanism
founded by the relation between reason, and those without the capacity
to be reasonable. Thought through in [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} sense,
the claim that "Black lives matter" [[asks]{.mark} of us to
**[not]{.mark}** fight [for]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Blackness [[in an **expanded
category**]{.mark} of human]{.underline}; rather, [[it asks for a
**perman**]{.underline}]{.mark}

By bringing the "sociogenic principle" into the Foucauldian analysis of
the episteme of Man, Wynter shows that our descriptive statements or
orders of truthknowledge- being are much more than merely "discursive"
and, as such, might seem to trap us inside our episteme even more than
Foucault supposedly does. This, however, is not true for Wynter. In her
estimation, Fanon's "discovery" that our modes of being are collectively
produced and narratively inscribed (i.e., sociogenic) breaches the
episteme in much the same way as the Renaissance studia humanitatis did.
By positing Man as a rational subject, the Renaissance humanists broke
with the theocentric descriptive statement and the Fallen Earth/Redeemed
Heavens symbolic code, opening the way for human knowledge and the rise
of the sciences. Similarly, for Wynter, Fanon effectively replaces the
biogenetic-economic descriptive statement Man2 and its symbolic code of
Successful-Selected- Eugenic-Bourgeois- White/Unsuccessful-Dysselected-
Dysgenic-Poor-Black with a sociogenic descriptive statement and opens
the door to being human as a collective praxis for the first time. This
Fanonian revolution, however, has not been effectuated as a result of
the immense grip of colonialism and capitalism in securing the
reproduction of the episteme of Man2. What this means is that the
overcoming of Man will not take place through wishful thinking or
declaring ourselves to be "posthuman," but will instead demand the
revolutionary overthrow of colonialism and capitalism through a
collective praxis of the human. Indeed, the posthumanists have
themselves bought too quickly into what Wynter (2003) calls the
"overrepresentation" of Man as isomorphic with the human "itself" in
their conviction that "the human" and "human agency" need to be
renounced as forms of "humanist arrogance." In many ways, Wynter would
agree with Claire Colebrook (2014a) that the posthumanist rush to
embrace things like "nature," "life itself," "the animal," or "the
universe" as ways of overcoming Man do not adequately grapple with the
ways in which each of those things have only ever been figured from
within the episteme of Man. [We have no conception of "nature," "life
itself," or "the animal," in other words, inseparable from the
descriptive statement of Man2 as biogenetic homo
economicus]{.underline}. [[We have mistaken]{.mark} the Map for the
world]{.underline}, Reason for all practices of knowing, [[Success in
evolutionary or capitalist competition for living]{.mark}, [and Man for
the human]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus to be able to know or live
differently requires not merely thinking our way out of Man, or turning
ourselves over to the "inhuman" forces of the Earth (Colebrook 2014a),
but a collective struggle to remake our world and our lives together as
humans through the end of capitalism, colonialism, and the brutal reign
of Man. The end of Man, then, will be a seismic
ethico-epistemoontological shift, a mutation that will transform our
bodies and minds, as well as life and the world themselves, at the
deepest levels. The key point here is that [the [**collective struggle**
against **capitalism and colonialism** is inseparable from]{.mark} a
[collective praxis of making the human beyond Man]{.mark}]{.underline}.
These two dimensions of revolutionary struggle have been called by Paget
Henry (2000: 121) the "horizontal" (i.e., economic, national, and
democratic struggles) and the "vertical" (i.e., transformations in
consciousness and the imagination), as we have discussed throughout this
book and to which we will return later in this chapter. This is the
reason for Wynter's emphasis on the need for new ceremonies that can
breach the immense divides generated by the symbolic codes of our
descriptive statements (see 1984 and 2007). For Wynter, these ceremonies
are always "heretical" acts, given that they violate the governing
splits of any episteme and, moreover, are often produced by those who
are liminalized Others within that episteme. In the Renaissance, for
example, the lay scholars and artists who were liminal others vis-à-vis
the ruling clergy broke down the Fallen Flesh/Redeemed Spirit symbolic
code through their resuscitation of "pagan" Greco- Roman art and
philosophy and their foundation of the studia humanitatis in which
literature, poetry, art, and music played a major role in the collective
making of Man1. Similarly, the perspectives of the liminal others of
Man2 are those that might possibly institute new ceremonies through
different imaginings and narrations of who and what we are and that
might open up a different praxis of being human. In this, Wynter is not
offering a redemptive vision of the Others to Man by arguing for the
inclusion of these Others into the very thought of Man or calling for
Humanism to be simply replaced with these modes of thinking from the
Other. For Wynter, as we have clearly seen, Man is not merely a mode of
thinking, but an epistemoontology that depends on brutal forms of
colonialism and capitalism to reproduce itself. Wynter, on the contrary,
insists that [[within]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [collective struggle to
overthrow]{.mark} these forms of [domination]{.mark}, [we must]{.mark}
also [look to the ways]{.mark} in which the [ritual practices]{.mark},
art, poetry, music, dance, literature, and mythology [of]{.mark} those
[liminalized others might]{.mark} point toward new ceremonies that could
[allow us to breach]{.mark} our [symbolic divides and enable]{.mark}
bodies to begin to engage differently with one another in [a new praxis
of being human together]{.mark}]{.underline} (2007). As Wynter shows us,
we cannot simply think our way beyond Man; rather, he can only be put to
rest through decolonial struggle. But, as Wynter, Henry, and other
decolonial thinkers allow us to see, this process also demands a
"vertical" revolution that confronts the deep and profound psychic and
somatic traumas associated with having to live one's life as a problem,
as damned, as a thing denied language, cultural heritage, respect for
ritual practices and ways of knowing oneself and the world, and any
possibility of life whatsoever. In A Dying Colonialism (1965) and The
Wretched of the Earth (2004), Fanon emphasizes that in revolutionary
struggle people find new ways of being embodied in the world with others
and that, if it is practiced as one in which the multitude struggles to
articulate its own togetherness, such a struggle becomes a harbinger of
new envisioned possibilities of being human collectively. In these
thinkers, [[we are not left with the "forced
choice"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Lacan 1981: 212) [[of]{.mark} either
[empty **redemptive** visions that]{.mark} only [further enframe us in
the episteme of Man or calls for **the end of any vision**]{.mark},
[which would]{.mark} then [leave us in our **vulnerability**]{.mark},
our hopelessness, [and]{.mark} our **[acceptance]{.mark}** that [we
may]{.mark} indeed [be doomed]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[and the planet
with us]{.underline}]{.mark}). [What we have here instead is an
articulation of how and why we might be able to struggle to be
differently, as well as how and why the liminalized Other, who is both
epistemologically and ontologically on the "other side" of the divide
from the institutions and narratives of Man, might provide different
materializations and imaginations of being human together]{.underline}.
The important point of the sociogenic principle as elaborated by Wynter
is that [[we have]{.mark} the "heretical" [power to charter our
**own**]{.mark} embodied [narratives of who and **what** we are]{.mark},
of [how we relate]{.mark} to each other, [and]{.mark} of [our place in
the universe]{.mark}---[which]{.mark}, [as]{.mark} her critique of [Man1
and Man2 makes]{.mark} powerfully [clear]{.mark}, [we have done
before]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as Wynter urgently reminds us, "we
have so little time left to actualize the nature of the hitherto
(millennially prohibited) heresy of securing the non-opacity of our own
agency, and with it, [the full autonomy of the new order of
cognition]{.underline} that [is]{.underline} now [imperatively called
for]{.underline}" (2007: 59). At the very least, what the vision that
Wynter and other decolonial thinkers offer us makes perfectly clear is
that [[the ideas that we]{.mark} either [accept]{.mark} our [fate
as]{.mark} fragile parts of an "[inhuman]{.mark}" world or queer
ourselves out of the future by embracing the death drive [are]{.mark}
themselves [completely inscribed within]{.mark} the order of things of
**[neoliberal capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
([[and]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore of [the **episteme of
[Man2]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[that reduces us to]{.mark} vulnerable
[biogenetic-economic entities at the whims of Natural Selection and the
Market with very little experience of the ways]{.mark} in which [people
can]{.mark} live, **[flourish]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} perhaps even
[**transform** the]{.mark} entire **[world]{.mark}**
together.]{.underline}

#### \*\*RECUT\*\*\-\--The black Atlantic critical tradition demonstrates the possibilities of reclaiming humanism. Supposedly European categories of political modernity belong as much to the African and Caribbean actors who coproduced them.

Gary **Wilder**, Associate Professor of Anthropology at The Graduate
Center of the City University of New York **'16**, Here/Hear Now Aimé
Césaire! The South Atlantic Quarterly, Vol. 115, No. 3, July 2016, p.
585-604

These key terms illuminate crucial aspects of what made Césaire a
distinctive thinker whose critical voice may continue to resonate for us
today. But in order to attend to [Césaire]{.underline} as he did his
predecessors---as a contemporary--- we should recognize how his
intellectual orientation and [insights brush against the grain of many
current theoretical tendencies. In both critical theory and postcolonial
studies, [the standard]{.mark} operation is to unmask purportedly
universal categories as socially constructed]{.underline}, culturally
particular, [and implicated in practices, systems, and logics of
domination]{.underline}. These are indispensable critical moves. But
[this approach [often **devolves into a hunt for** traces of]{.mark}
universalism or **[humanism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether in textual
artifacts or political projects, [in order to reveal the]{.underline}
regressive or [oppressive essence of the object. This "aha"
moment]{.underline} thus [becomes the **punch line of the discussion**
rather than the **starting point for analysis**. Such fears of
complicity with power do not only belie a [longing for]{.mark}
intellectual and [political purity]{.mark}. They also [make it difficult
to think dialectically]{.mark}, [to identify aspects of]{.mark} given
[arrangements that]{.mark} may **[point beyond their]{.mark} actually
[existing forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The current insistence on [negative critique]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[makes scholars reluctant to]{.mark} identify desirable alternatives
and [**specify** the]{.mark} kind of [world they might want to
create]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [**what do we concede** if we are
unable or unwilling to risk affirming more just, more human, ways of
being to which we can say "yes"? It is not easy for radical thinkers to
reconcile a **nonprescriptive orientation** to a radically open future
with the imperative to envision more desirable arrangements]{.underline}
(Coronil 2011). [But ignoring or deferring the challenge does not make
it disappear. Following [anticolonial thinkers like Césaire]{.mark},
especially those located [within]{.mark} [the black Atlantic]{.mark}
critical [tradition,]{.mark} may [remind us **not to forfeit
categories** such as]{.mark} freedom, [justice]{.mark}, democracy,
solidarity, [and humanity to]{.mark} the [dominant actors who have
**instrumentalized and degraded them**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Given this dilemma, the attention paid to Vivek Chibber's recent polemic
against subaltern studies is not surprising. Such attention, however,
seems to be less about the merits of his universalist Marxism than about
a sense of some of the limitations and impasses into which certain
currents of postcolonial thinking have led (Chibber 2013).7 Partha
Chatterjee himself has recently written, "The task, as it now stands,
cannot . . . be taken forward within the framework of the concepts and
methods mobilized in Subaltern Studies . . . what is needed are new
projects" (2012a: 44). He suggests that such projects should probably
focus on "cultural history" and "popular culture" with a renewed focus
on visual materials and embodied practices rather than written texts and
on ethnography rather than intellectual history. Moreover, he links this
invitation to study "the ethnographic, the practical, the everyday and
the local" to a focus on subnational "regional formations" and "minority
cultures" and languages whose specificities, he observes, had not been
sufficiently engaged by earlier subaltern studies research on "India,"
"Pakistan," or "Bangladesh" (47--49). Valuable as such studies would
surely be, it is not clear how a renewed focus on locality, with
place-based assumptions about territory, consciousness, and categories,
could do the kind of critical work necessary to grasp the deep shifts in
political logics, structures, and practices that characterize the
world-historical present. On the contrary, such approaches risk
reproducing precisely the culturalist and territorialist assumptions
about political identification and affiliation that need to be rethought
in light of contemporary conditions.8

Chatterjee's surprising [emphasis on local ethnography seems consistent
with one trend in postcolonial thinking that risks reviving the types of
civilizational thinking, and associated assumptions about origins and
authenticity, that it had earlier set out to dismantle]{.underline}
(Chakrabarty 2007; Mah- mood 2005; Mignolo 2011). Consider the important
ways that Talal Asad has invited us to rethink liberal assumptions about
"tradition," with respect to liberal and nonliberal forms of life. In
dialogue with Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre, Asad (1986)
has developed a powerful critique of liberal secularism---and the
secularist logic that subtends many modern liberal states---from the
standpoint of embodied and discursive traditions. On the one hand, he
reminds us that "Islamic tradition" is neither singular nor unchanging;
it is a structured and dynamic space for reasoned argument. On the other
hand, he reminds us that [despite liberalism's claims to post-
traditional neutrality, it too constitutes a particular
tradition]{.underline} (albeit one that defines itself in opposition to
inherited, embodied, and practice-oriented forms of tradition-based
reasoning).

[Asad's [genealogical]{.mark} [insights]{.mark}]{.underline} have
rightly informed recent critiques of Western liberal ideologies, states,
and politics especially regarding their arrogant, condescending, and
violent responses to tradition-rooted practices and practitioners,
whether outside or inside the West. But his interventions, however
[unintentionally, [have]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[led scholars to
establish dubious chains of equivalence between modernity, the West, and
liberalism.]{.mark} Such operations seem to disregard Asad's important
invitation to understand traditions as]{.underline} capacious,
[heterogeneous, and dynamic spaces of inquiry]{.underline}, disputation,
[and revision, **not simply** as a set of rigid behavioral scripts,
unchanging cultural formulas, or dogmatic ideological precepts. This
[reduction]{.mark} of political modernity [to a **one-dimensional
liberalism obscure**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}, for example, [the many
currents of [progressive antiliberalism within]{.mark} the tradition of
modern [Western political thought. It fails to recognize]{.mark} the
[significant]{.mark} number of [non-European colonial intellectuals
engaged in anti-imperial struggles who were **active participants** in
such]{.mark} "[traditions]{.mark} within traditions." It]{.underline}
also [disregards the **contradictions within and redeemable fragments**
of]{.underline} even [liberal political thinking, fragments
that]{.underline}, if realized, [might **point far beyond**, and
possibly **explode, liberalism itself**]{.underline}.

[To reify modern or Western politics into a static and stereotypical
liberalism is to risk practicing an unfortunate]{.underline} form of
["Occidentalism" that would reinforce archaic civilizational assumptions
about **incommensurable** and unrelated worlds]{.underline} (and
worldviews) [and **disregard the actual history** and open possibilities
for practices of cross-cultural solidarity whereby anti-imperial actors
outside Europe could **enter into dialogue**]{.underline} or affiliate
[with, or even discover ways that they are **already situated** within,
counterhegemonic "Western" political traditions]{.underline}. Critics
have rightly mobilized singularity, incommensurability, or
untranslatability against liberal attempts to discover an abstract
humanity and thereby discount situated and embodied forms of life. But
the question is whether we treat incommensurability or untranslatability
as an epistemological or political limit or as an always imperfect
starting point for practices of dialogue, coordination, affiliation,
reciprocity, solidarity. For isn't the impossibility of full
transparency or undifferentiated unity simply the unavoidable condition
within which all communication, sociality, and politics must be
attempted?9

[My point is not]{.underline} to congratulate dissident currents within
the West, let alone [to recuperate liberalism. It is rather to approach
radical and emancipatory politics from a place of not-already-knowing,
of not presuming to know a priori which aspects of a tradition are
irredeemable]{.underline}, which traditions may become allies or
habitations, [what the boundaries of]{.underline} (thoroughly
[plastic]{.underline}) [traditions must be. This **nondogmatic and
experimental orientation to politics**, traditions, and concepts is one
of the most precious and timely gifts]{.underline} that [Césaire may
offer to us now. He practiced a concrete cosmopolitan relationship to
modern traditions of philosophy]{.underline}, aesthetics, [and
politics]{.underline}, one that was highly developed by the robust
tradition of black Atlantic criticism within which he was firmly rooted
along with predecessors (e.g., Toussaint and W. E. B. DuBois),
contemporaries (e.g., C. L. R. James, James Baldwin, Suzanne Césaire,
Senghor), and descendants (e.g., Fanon, Edouard Glissant, Stuart Hall,
Paul Gilroy, Achille Mbembe, David Scott).

[Understandable concerns about totalizing explanation and Eurocentric
evaluation have led a generation of scholars to insist on the
incommensurable alterity of non-European forms of thought. But perhaps
we should be concerned less exclusively with unmasking universalisms as
covert European particularism than with **also challenging** the
assumption that the universal is **European property**. I read
Césaire]{.underline} not in order to provincialize European concepts but
[to deprovincialize Antillean thinking. Césaire's critical reworkings
remind us that the [supposedly European categories of political
modernity]{.mark} properly **[belong as much to the African and
Caribbean actors who coproduced them]{.mark}** as to the inhabitants of
continental Europe]{.underline}. Similarly, [[African and Caribbean
thinkers]{.mark}, no less than their continental counterparts,
[produced]{.mark} abstract and general [propositions about "humanity,"
"history," and "the world."]{.mark} In contrast to invocations of
multiple modernities, [Césaire never granted to Europe possession
of]{.mark} a modernity or [universality or humanity that was **always
already translocal and**]{.mark} **fundamentally [Caribbean]{.mark}**.
He never treated self-determination, emancipation, freedom, equality, or
justice as essentially European]{.underline} and foreign. Césaire's
intellectual and political interventions radically challenged reductive
territorialist approaches to social thought. He refused to concede that
"France" was an ethnic or continental entity, that Martinique was not in
some real way internal to "French" society and politics, or that he was
situated outside of modern critical traditions. Thus his ongoing and
unapologetic engagements with Hegel, Marx, Proudhon, Nietzsche,
Lautréamont, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Bergson, Freud, Breton, Frobenius, and
Lenin, alongside his many African, Antillean, and African American
interlocutors.

The sonic blurring between "here" and "hear" in the title of this essay
is meant to signal not only the contemporaneity of Césaire's thought for
us here now but the imperative that we open ourselves to his presence
and recognize his actuality across the epochal divide by hearing what he
actually said. This gesture builds on Walter Benjamin's insight that
every now is a "now of recognizability" whereby "what has been comes
together in a flash with the now to form a constellation" through which
past epochs become newly legible (1999: 462). I also follow Césaire
himself, who engaged in dialogue with predecessors as if they were
contemporaries and who addressed future interlocutors directly as if
they were already present. Like Benjamin, [Césaire practiced a form of
**radical remembrance** that connected outmoded pasts to **charged
presents**. This attention to vital histories was bound up with a poetic
politics that identified transformative possibilities **dwelling within
existing arrangements**]{.underline} and a proleptic politics that
anticipated seemingly impossible futures by trying to enact them
concretely in the here and now. But Césaire can only speak to us now if
we listen rather than presume to know what someone like him in his
situation must have, or should have, been saying.

Until very recently, scholarship on his work has been overdetermined by
methodological nationalism (that puzzles over his refusal to pursue
state sovereignty), identitarian culturalism (that debates how
adequately Césaire expressed Antillean lived experience and whether or
not he was an essentialist), and a disciplinary division of labor (that
too often splits his poetry, criticism, and politics into separate
domains). Generally, Cold War scholarship was shaped by a need to
evaluate him in relation to canonical anticolonial nationalists and fit
him into a narrative of decolonization-as-national-independence. This
has made it difficult to recognize the epochal character, world-making
ambition, and global sensibility of his political reflections.

Faced with the promise of decolonization, [Césaire conjugated concrete
acts with political imagination]{.underline} in ways that displaced
conventional oppositions between aesthetics and politics, realism and
utopia, pragmatism and principle. Such efforts were animated by what I
have been calling radical literalism and utopian realism and which he
called inflection and poetic knowledge. He regarded freedom as a problem
whose institutional solution was not self-evident and could only be
situational. His interventions demonstrated the nonnecessary
relationship between colonial emancipation, popular sovereignty, and
self-determination, on the one hand, and territorial state sovereignty
and national liberation, on the other. [He pursued cosmopolitan aims
concretely through transcultural practices and by attempting to invent
new political forms through which to ground plural and postnational
democratic arrangements]{.underline}.

We should recognize that Césaire formulated a critique not of Western
civilization from the standpoint of African or Antillean culture but of
modern Western racism, imperialism, and capitalism from the standpoint
of Antillean and African historical situations and experiences. More
generally, it was a critique of an alienated and alienating modernity
from the standpoint of embodied and poetic ways of being, knowing, and
relating (to self, others, and world). Above all, [Césaire recognized
residues of, and resources for, more just, human, and integrated ways of
living together within Antillean, African, and European texts,
traditions, forms, histories, and conditions. In his view,
Antilleans---as culturally particular actors, imperial subjects, New
World denizens, moderns, and humans---were their rightful heirs. He was
concerned less with defining culturally authentic concepts, spaces, and
arrangements for Antilleans]{.underline} (apart from Europe or
uncontaminated by modernity) [than with overcoming imperialism, in
solidarity with other struggling peoples, in order to establish less
alienated forms of human life globally]{.underline}.

[Remembering [Césaire's insistence that modern]{.mark} currents of
[radicalism were shared legacies and common property may help us to
**rethink inherited assumptions**]{.mark} about the relation between
territory, ethnicity, consciousness, and interest]{.underline}
(Buck-Morss 2009, 2010). [They invite us to deterritorialize social
thought [and]{.mark} to [decolonize intellectual history]{.mark}. This
is a matter not of valorizing non-European forms of
knowledge]{.underline}, as important as such a move certainly is, [but
of questioning the presumptive boundaries of "Europe" itself---by
recognizing the larger scales on which modern social thought was forged
and of appreciating that colonial societies produced self-reflexive
thinkers concerned with large-scale processes and future prospects. We
can]{.underline} thereby [recognize Césaire as a situated postwar
thinker of the postwar world, one of whose primary aims was to place
into question the very categories "France," "Europe," and "the West" by
way of an immanent critique of late imperial politics. He envisioned
postnational arrangements through which humanity could]{.underline}
attempt to [overcome the alienating antinomies that had impoverished the
quality of life in overseas colonies and European metropoles. His
**situated humanism and concrete cosmopolitanism** should]{.underline}
thus [be placed in a **constellation of modern emancipatory thinking**
oriented toward **worldwide human freedom** that included antiracist,
anti-imperial, internationalist, and socialist thinkers from a range of
traditions: black Atlantic, First Internationalist, global anarchist,
Western Marxist, Marxist humanist, Third Worldist]{.underline}.

[Césaire believed that the future of humanity depended in some sense on
its recovering a lost poetic relation to "the throbbing newness of the
world." Why not regard Césaire's "humanism made to the measure of the
world" as a starting point for our critical thinking about the
contemporary situation and the kind of world we would like to
create]{.underline}. Césaire, like Toussaint before him, addressed
future interlocutors directly. At the same time, his thinking about
future possibilities was refracted through dialogue with predecessors
like Toussaint. This is how I understand what one of his heirs,
Glissant, means by "a prophetic vision of the past" based on "the
identification of a painful notion of time and its full projection
forward into the future" (1989: 64; see also Glissant 2005: 15, 16).
Césaire once wrote of Schoelcher, the socialist republican architect of
the 1848 abolition of slavery in France, that it would be "useless to
commemorate him if we had not decided to imitate his politics" (1948a:
28). In this spirit [I hope that the recent resurgence of interest in
Césaire]{.underline} is not only treated as an occasion to honor his
memory but [is seized as an opportunity to hear his transgenerational
address. We can]{.underline} thus [think with Césaire about the relation
between existing theoretical frameworks, the world we are confronting,
and urgent political desires--- especially with regard to the history of
empire and the role of colonial intellectuals as modern thinkers of
global processes]{.underline}.

#### Abandonment of human survival and value itself capitulates to capitalist colonialism. Their critique of the human erases the struggles of those outside the global North who have never conceded to the reign of Man.

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet
Union [it would seem that the idea of [revolution has been swept into
the dustbin]{.mark} of history]{.underline}, or at least into the
dustbin of the Euro-American academy. Even [within feminist and queer
theory, two of the academic discourses ostensibly most devoted to
sweeping transformation, the word scarcely appears in most of the work
written over the past three decades]{.underline}. Our purpose here is
not to offer an extensive investigation into the reasons for this
post-revolutionary "turn." Certainly part of it is a general air of
pessimism that has swept through critical theory in the face of the
failures of the so-called Communist states to actualize the great
socialist aspirations and the ruthlessness of advanced capitalism that
has created inequalities of world historical proportions, let alone the
never-ending war, horrific structural violence, and brutal suppression
of revolutionary movements that plague our world today (see Cornell
2008). [[The Marxist dream of a revolution]{.mark} toward an emancipated
humanity and a classless planetary society [is,]{.mark} we are told even
by supposedly leftist thinkers, [a hopelessly romantic]{.mark} and
impossible [metanarrative that relies on]{.mark} bad pretensions to
scientific truth and [problematic assumptions]{.mark} of an originary
"human nature." Moreover, [revolution, the story goes, is inextricably
connected to a hubris of humanism]{.mark}]{.underline} that cannot
survive the "death of Man" in late-twentieth century European
philosophy, [a hubris that sees Man as the maker of his own world and
therefore as having the power to change it.]{.underline} Feminist and
queer theory, of course, have long highlighted and critiqued the
phallocentrism and heteronormativity inherent to all forms of humanism
and, as such, for several decades now they too have largely relinquished
revolution as a necessary part of overcoming Man. Unfortunately,
however, such reports of the death of Man seem, paraphrasing Mark Twain,
to have been greatly exaggerated. This is not, to be sure, for lack of
trying. Indeed, there have been countless assaults on Man over the past
centuries: from the attack on his false universalism by early feminists
and abolitionists (Wollstonecraft 1992, Cugoano 1999) to Nietzsche's
(1968) blistering assault on the nihilism he brings, from to the late
twentieth century critique of his metaphysical presuppositions (Derrida
1984, Foucault, 1994, Heidegger 2008a) to more recent feminist and
de-colonial challenges to the violent exclusions he relies on for his
perpetuation (Irigaray 1985, Spivak 1999, Wynter 2003, Fanon 2004).
[This death of Man rhetoric has taken on an especially apocalyptic tenor
in light of what climate scientists have named the
"Anthropocene,"]{.underline} that is, the geological epoch of the "human
dominance of biological, chemical, and geological processes on Earth"
(Crutzen & Schwägerl 2011). The immense threat posed by climate change,
coupled with the limited ability of "traditional" frameworks in the
humanities and sciences (including Marxism) to appropriately address it,
has called for a fundamental reconsideration of the place of "the human"
within nature and history and laid bare the profound vulnerability of
Man (see Chakrabarty 2009). If centuries of violent exploitation of his
many Others has not been strong enough cause for his deposing, perhaps
his now-too-obvious destruction of the planet might be. That is, of
course, if the planet doesn't get him first. (As always, we hardly need
to point out, Man will be the last casualty of his own destructive
boomerang and, thus, we feminists should not revel too much in watching
him wince in the face of his own impending doom.) [[This seismic shift
in the]{.mark} geopolitical---better, cosmopolitical---[scene has
provoked some thinkers to call for a merciful end to
**Man**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We cannot possibly hope to address the
monumental problems facing us today, they suggest, with the
"traditional" philosophy of Man---"Humanism." As such, "[posthumanist"
theorists have sought to move beyond]{.mark} the many [boundary projects
of Humanism]{.mark},]{.underline} which work to reconsolidate Man as the
sovereign subject of rational mastery, and to reconceptualize our place
in the material universe in a more egalitarian and sustainable way
(Braidotti 2013). [One can certainly see why posthumanism might be a
palatable alternative to the old Humanism for many feminist and queer
theorists, given feminism's birth as a challenge to the "universal"
philosophy of Man, and indeed, there is much recent work that seeks to
use posthumanism as a way of freeing us from any lingering attachment to
the humanist subject (Man) as crucial to feminist and queer politics and
from an enduring human exceptionalism in relation to animals and other
forms of matter.]{.underline} Often juxtaposed to the so-called
linguistic turn (which is usually said to include both psychoanalysis
and Foucauldian "discourse analysis" as residual Humanisms), [these
thinkers in feminist-queer science studies, "new" materialism, and
affect theory, attempt to reconfigure humans as dynamic open systems
embedded in a vital universe characterized by the constant flux of
matter-energy, perpetual transformation, and unpredictable forms of
entanglement]{.underline} (see Barad 2007, Giffney & Hird 2008, Coole &
Frost 2010, Gregg & Seigworth 2010, Dolphijn & van der Tuin 2012). From
this perspective, it might seem that by even thinking about
revolutionary socialism as absolutely necessary for a cosmopolitical
feminist and queer theory and politics, we are embracing an
old-fashioned Humanist dream, or what Rosi Braidotti refers to as
Marxism's "humanistic arrogance of continuing to place Man at the centre
of world history" (2013: 23). While we wholeheartedly affirm the end of
Man and the rethinking of our relationships with the other forms of
matter, both living and non, with which we share the universe,
[[we]{.mark} do [question the]{.mark} increasing [effort put into
debunking "the human" and "human agency]{.mark}" at a time [when
neo-colonial and neoliberal capitalism have perhaps never been more
destructive]{.mark} to the vast majority of the world's inhabitants
(human and non). [Why does it seem]{.mark}, in other words, that
[posthumanism is necessarily post-revolutionary]{.mark}?]{.underline}
While the joyous vitality that seems to characterize much of this
posthumanist theory and its celebration of our connectedness with the
universe (including technology) would seem to put these thinkers very
far afield from Martin Heidegger's "pessimism" about our ensnarement in
modern technoscientific rationality (2008b), in the end we are often
left with something quite similar to Heidegger's conviction that there
is nothing humans can actively do to make things better without
intensifying our ensarement and we must therefore patiently hope that
Being (or the planet in this case) chooses to spare us in spite of our
past sins. [[For posthumanism, any focus on specifically human
agency]{.mark} (such as that involved in the struggle against capitalism
and colonialism) [always risks a reinstatement of the old humanist
subject]{.mark}]{.underline}, effectively smuggling in the Man who
fucked everything up in the first place through the back door. [Thus
many [posthumanist critics are engaged in a hypervigilant search for Man
in]{.mark} every form of [theory and politics, and any trace of him must
be]{.mark} sussed out and [rejected in the name of "life itself"]{.mark}
and the future of the planet]{.underline}. When not a call for a more
ecologically sustainable way of living based on a reassessment of the
integral linkages between all scales of existence, then, the most
"political" (or, perhaps better put, polemical) of posthumanisms are
typically directed at deflating the "humanistic arrogance" of other
academics and political theories rather than at any forms of systemic
violence such as capitalism, colonialism, racism, or phallocentrism. We
are not the first, to be sure, to register uneasiness over the
often-blithe repudiation of Man and his premature burial in much
posthumanist theory, especially considering how spectacularly Man's
handiwork is presently on display. Claire [Colebrook]{.underline}
(2014a, 2014b), for example, [has put the brakes on any celebratory
posthumanism that would claim to have abdicated Man's throne atop the
great chain of being. According to Colebrook, posthumanism is a
recuperative gesture which enables Man to continue surviving
vampirically]{.underline} by appearing to be dead while appropriating
his previously excluded Others as his now-proper domain. As she
convincingly argues, we should not buy so easily into the sham of Man's
self-effacement. While making atonement for his past exclusion and
exploitation of the rest of the universe (i.e., women, the colonized,
nonhuman animals, "life itself," the Earth), Man redeems himself while
simultaneously annexing these prior exclusions. Thus, [[when
posthumanists]{.mark} and feminists [turn to]{.mark} something like
"[life itself]{.mark}" or to our interconnectedness with the material
universe as a way of overcoming Man, and while they spend their efforts
diligently hunting down Man in all his former guises, [Man has made off
with the "goods" once again]{.mark}]{.underline}. [For Colebrook, then,
posthumanism is actually an "ultrahumanism]{.underline}," which simply
takes the world as Man had always made it in his (Euro-American,
Bourgeois, White) image and supposedly "subtracts" Man, leaving Man's
old world masquerading as a new "posthuman" one. As she puts it:
"Humanism posits an elevated or exceptional 'man' to grant sense to
existence, then when 'man' is negated or removed what is left is the
human all too human tendency to see the world as one giant
anthropomorphic self-organizing living body" (2014a: 164). Because it
was always Man who had given the world its sense, pronouncing Man dead
ironically allows him to live on stronger than before because the world
continues on in his image while his former critics---feminists, for
example---now content themselves with his "vacated" world and devote
themselves to tracking him down only in his old clothes (which he of
course discarded long ago). So far, so good. [We agree that
[posthumanism]{.mark} is a bit too self-congratulatory in its
self-conferred status as the undertaker of Man. We also agree that it
[is]{.mark} often [politically distracting]{.mark}---despite its best
intentions---and that while [many of its theorists are busy having
contests]{.mark} over which of quantum nonlocality or bacterial sex is
"queerer" and castigating]{.underline} the ancien régime (i.e.,
[Marxists]{.underline} and "poststructuralists") [for its humanist
dementia[, Man is laughing all the way to the bank.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[This point, however, is also where we part company with]{.underline}
[Colebrook]{.underline}. [For Colebrook, while the urgent possibility of
human extinction is not the occasion for posthumanism, neither is it the
occasion for revolutionary struggle]{.underline}. To quote her: What if
social political revolution among human beings were still to leave the
relation between the human species and life in the same place? Today's
frequently cited Marxist cry---it is easier to imagine the end of the
world than the end of capitalism---should be read as symptomatic. Should
we not be more concerned with the world's end than the relations among
markets and individuals? The Marxist premise that we cannot save the
world ecologically until capitalism is dealt with, should be questioned,
and reversed: as long as we imagine life and the world to be primarily
anthropogenic, or emerging from human meaning and history, we will not
confront the disjunction between the human species (in all its modes)
and the life that it regards as its own. A new mode of critique that
would not be political would be required. Indeed, it is the political
gesture, or the understanding of conflicts as ultimately intra-human,
that needs to be questioned. One needs a hypo-Marxism or counter-Marxism
whereby the very premise of Marxism---man as a laboring animal who
furthers his own life---needs to be recognized as the limit of thinking.
For what 'we' cannot accept is the obvious counter to this assumption:
man is not an animal who furthers his own survival (2014a: 197-8). As
such, [Colebrook asks us not to imagine a more just world, but rather
"what life would be like if one could abandon the fantasy of one's own
endurance]{.underline}....for beyond 'man' one cannot figure the good
life but only contingent, fragile, insecure, and ephemeral lives"
(2014b: 22). **[Frankly, [we have had quite enough of "contingent,
fragile, insecure, and ephemeral lives]{.mark}." Indeed, this sounds
[not like the imagination of living beyond Man, but rather like a
meticulou]{.mark}s description of the lives of the majority of the world
under conditions of advanced capitalism right now.]{.underline}** Of
course, her point here is that "Man" (and presumably capitalism) is an
apotropaic charm that ensures (the fantasy of) survival for certain
members of the human species---an immunological protection against the
contingency, fragility, insecurity, and ephemerality inherent to our
existence as animals in an indifferent universe. For Colebrook, Man has
convinced himself through this fantasy that the Earth is his "home." And
it is precisely this fantasy, this protective bubble that Man bought
himself at the expense of all his others, that is now being burst by the
impending climatological catastrophe. Despite her astute critique,
however, [Colebrook ultimately leaves us in what is perhaps a worse
position than the posthumanists: dispossessing ourselves of our arrogant
fantasy of survival and giving ourselves back over to the volatility of
the universe, since any idea of enduring (and certainly flourishing)
involves the reinstatement of an anthropomorphic enframing of the
world's "inhuman" forces.]{.underline}

[[Meanwhile, back at the ranch...]{.underline}]{.mark}

• Approximately 95% of the world population (6.7 billion) lives on less

(Ravallion, Chen & Sangraula 2008).

• [[The richest eighty-five]{.mark} individuals]{.underline} (0.000001%)
[[possess as much wealth as the poorest half]{.mark} of the world's
population]{.underline} (i.e. 3,500,000,000 people) (Oxfam 2014).

• [Anywhere from five to [twenty thousand Africans]{.mark} have [died in

• [Current animal extinction rates are one-thousand times higher than

been called "Anthropocene defaunation" (Dirzo et al. 2014).

• [[One in fifteen black men]{.mark} in the U.S. [is

more likely to be killed by a police officer than white men (Gabrielson

percent of these deaths occur in the global South.]{.underline}
(Prüss-Üstün et al. 2008, WHO/UNICEF 2012)

• [Approximately 21 million people are victims of forced labor and 1.2
million children are trafficked annually]{.underline} (International
Labour Organization 2012).

[[It is unclear how, without any ideal of **collective survival or
flourishing**]{.mark}, [we might be able to begin to address
these]{.mark} (and countless other) [crises]{.mark}]{.underline} (see
Cornell 2004). For us, [it is not (]{.underline}as Colebrook perhaps
rightfully characterizes certain Marxist positions) [that the ecological
disaster cannot be addressed until after we have ended capitalism, but
rather, that the relentless pursuit of profit inherent to capitalism
will never permit us to address issues of the climate and ecology in any
substantive way because all attempts to do so must remain compatible
with the dictates of surplus accumulation]{.underline}. [The crises of
advanced capital and of the climate (as well as the others to which we
have referred) are fundamentally linked---a point not lost on billions
in the global South]{.underline}. Furthermore, we refuse the "forced
choice" (to borrow a phrase from Jacques Lacan) offered by Colebrook and
other posthumanist theorists. For Lacan, a "forced choice" is a result
of the "alienating or" that makes us see a choice when there really is
not one. His example, quite pertinent here, is a thief's threat: "Your
money or your life!" Either way, the victim loses the money (Lacan 1981:
212). By implying that we must choose either to save life (our lives,
endangered species' lives or "life itself") or to struggle against
capitalism, these theorists have accepted the "alienating or" of
advanced capitalism. [[We insist on]{.mark} both life (human and non)
and [an end to capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} And indeed this is
precisely the position being taken by climate scientists and activists
around the world who are explicitly linking climate politics to
counter-capitalist movements (see Klein 2013, 2014). As geophysicist
Brad Werner has suggested (in a lecture at the American Geophysical
Union entitled "Is Earth Fucked? Dynamical Futility of Global
Environmental Management and Possibilities for Sustainability via Direct
Action Activism,") [the only "dynamic" in his statistical modeling that
is cause for "hope" is "resistance \[or, movements of\] people or groups
of people \[who\] adopt a certain set of dynamics that does not fit
within the capitalist culture...\[including\] environmental direct
action, resistance taken from outside the dominant culture, as in
protests, blockades and sabotage by indigenous peoples, workers,
anarchists and other activist groups"]{.underline} (quoted in Klein
2013). [In on-the-ground movements against and serious scientific
research into climatological catastrophe, in other words, [there is
neither a call to renounce old "Humanist" fantasies of agency or
survival nor any pretense that capitalism must not be ended in order to
"save"]{.mark} life and [the planet]{.mark}. What there is, however, is
the idea that [collective human action can transform the
situation]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Bad" redemptive vision? Of course it's
possible. But [perhaps [we ought to try it first before being so sure
that embracing ephemerality and fragility is the best]{.mark} left for
us. Surely we owe it to those who were forcibly made to
subsidize]{.underline} (often with their lives) [Man's fantasy of
survival over the last five centuries]{.underline}---those who do not
need academics to help them divest themselves of their arrogant survival
fantasies because they never had them in the first place, and those who
bear the least responsibility for the destruction that they now face
most imminently (while Man plans his next colonial vacation in the deep
sea or in "outer" space). To us, all of this renunciation of survival
and transformative possibility by Euro-American academics sounds a
little too much like the older sibling who refuses to share his toy and
then purposefully destroys it before being forced to hand it down: "Oh
you want this? I never liked it anyway." To be clear, we are not
suggesting that either the posthumanist theorists or Colebrook do not
know or care about the "obvious disparity between those who benefit
economically from the processes leading to climate change and those who
will have to pay for most of the environmental and social costs" (Mora
et al. 2013). Nor are we engaged in a simple exercise in demystification
in which we purport to reveal the workings of capital behind all of
today's contemporary problems to those who did not previously see it.
[We do wonder why, however, for many posthumanist thinkers the claim
that the destructivity of Man has reached its pinnacle seems to
necessarily involve a simultaneous refutation of revolutionary desires
and possibilities rather than a more urgent call for collective
action.]{.underline} [It should, perhaps, at least give us pause when
scientists are more forcefully expressing the political implications of
their research and calling for collective responses than feminists and
other political theorists]{.underline} (see Mora et al 2013; Klein 2013,
2014). And on that note, [neither is our point here a doomsday jeremiad
lamenting the lack of global political response at such a crucial
moment; indeed, there is no dearth of collective struggles against
neo-colonialism, advanced capitalism, and ecological destruction around
the world today. In light of this, academics in the Euro-American
humanities risk being more out of touch than ever.]{.underline}

#### Radical humanism committed to remaking this world is necessary---the 1AC contradicts Césaire's [situated humanism]{.underline} that avoids the twin pitfalls of [imperialism]{.underline} and [provincialism]{.underline}.

Gary **WILDER**, Associate Professor of Anthropology at The Graduate
Center of the City University of New York, **16** \["Here/Hear Now Aimé
Césaire!" *The South Atlantic Quarterly*, Vol. 115, No. 3, July 2016, p.
585-604, Accessed Online through Emory Libraries\]

I have suggested that [[Césaire's struggle against imperialism]{.mark}
was bound up with a program for human emancipation in and beyond the
Caribbean. His]{.underline} untimely [vision for decolonization [was
inseparable from a **radically humanist commitment** to deprovincialize
Africanity]{.mark}, universalize black thought, [**redeem humanity**,
and **remake the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Discourse on
Colonialism he famously expressed his aim: "to live a true humanism to
the measure of the world \[à la mesure du monde\]" (Césaire 1976: 397).
[[This hope]{.underline}]{.mark}, I believe, [was both quantitative and
qualitative: beyond calling for a truly global humanism that would fit
the size of the world, it]{.underline} also [[invoked]{.mark} a
[humanism]{.mark} that would be fitting for the world]{.underline}.
Césaire pursued a form of decolonization that would transcend the
sterile opposition between abstract humanism and territorial
nationalism, while retaining the universalism of the former and the
embodied specificity of the latter. [He hoped [to fashion a political
form that would allow colonizers and colonized to recognize their
**entangled histories** and build a common future]{.mark} without
recourse either to]{.underline} the humanism that authorized
[colonialism or to]{.underline} the parochial [nationalism]{.underline}
and culturalism [that would obstruct the]{.underline} creation of the
kind of [solidarities that]{.underline} both Antillean freedom and [new
planetary politics required]{.underline}. Thus in his "Letter to Maurice
Thorez" Césaire, disaffected with departmentalization's republican
universalism and the Communist Party's internationalist universalism,
demanded a politics that neither "burie\[d\] \[him\] in a narrow
particularism" nor forced him to "lose himself in an emaciated
\[décharné\] universalism" (1956: 15). Hoping to transcend both
"walled-in segregation" and "dilution in the universal," he envisioned
an alternative "universal rich with everything that is particular,
enriched and deepened by all particulars, by the coexistence of all
particulars" (15). Like Giuseppe Mazzini (2009), Senghor, and Frantz
Fanon, he believed that particular peoples become more fully human (and
therefore universal) by realizing their specific qualities most fully.
[For Césaire]{.underline}, in other words, [a [true humanism]{.mark}
made to the measure of the world would [have to be concrete and
**situated**]{.mark}---one that worked [through]{.mark} Antilleans'
history and [lived experiences of racial and colonial
domination]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his 1959 speech at the Second
International Congress of Black Artists and Writers, Césaire called on
"men of culture" to make black art and literature "sacred . . . by
raising the particular situation of our peoples to the universal" (1959:
121--22). [Rather than a humanism that searches for]{.underline} aspects
of [a predefined universal]{.underline} within particular peoples or
societies, [he believed that particular peoples in specific historical
situations]{.underline}, as well as their situated thinkers, [could
offer concrete forms of life as global gifts that could indicate how to
live a more fully human life, one that was nourished by poetic knowledge
and that avoided the **twin pitfalls of imperialism and
provincialism**]{.underline}. [[Césaire's radical humanism]{.mark} did
not abstract from differences in order to find some]{.underline}
underlying or [overarching sameness]{.underline}. Rather, [it [sought to
join]{.mark} particular [peoples within larger]{.mark} forms and
[networks of transcontinental solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
formations would be composed of and in ected by the intersection of
distinct lifeworlds. At the same time, [from his Caribbean or black
Atlantic vantage, [he **questioned** a view of world history]{.mark} or
global politics [that **ontologized**]{.mark} distinct forms of life.
[His **situated humanism** was founded on the recognition that]{.mark}
the entwined histories of [slavery, imperialism, capitalism]{.mark},
republicanism, [and modernism had bound metropolitan and Caribbean
peoples to one another within a **shared**]{.mark} **if asymmetrical
[modernity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On such grounds he refused to relate
to European history, politics, and thought from the outside, as a
foreigner. Rather, [he claimed as his own proper inheritance [those
radical]{.mark} intellectual and [political traditions]{.mark} that
[could no longer be]{.mark} conventionally [figured
as]{.mark}]{.underline} "French," "European," [or
["Western."]{.mark}]{.underline} At the 1959 congress Césaire argued
that black creators had "a human duty" even more profound than their
"particular duties" because "finally, there is a question that no man of
culture can escape, regardless of his country or his race, which is the
following: 'What kind of world are you preparing for us?'" Césaire
responded to his own question by relating black self-determination to
human self-realization: By articulating our effort with the effort of
the liberation of colonized peoples, by struggling for the dignity of
our peoples, for their truth and for their recognition, it is by de
nition for the whole entire world that we fight, to liberate it from
tyranny, from hatred, and from fanaticism. Beyond the struggles of the
present, circumstantial as they are . . . we want a rejuvenated and
rebalanced world, without which nothing will have any meaning . . . not
even our struggle today . . . not even our victory tomorrow. Then and
only then will we have been victorious and our final victory will mark
the advent of a new era. We will have contributed to giving a meaning .
. . to the most overused yet most glorious word: we will have helped to
found a universal humanism. (1959: 122) Here then was [Césaire's
radically literalist gesture of reclaiming]{.underline}, de-rusting,
[inflecting, and refunctioning "humanism" and "universalism." For him
the problem was not merely that in the hands of Europeans these were
hypocritical claims and ideological screens, selectively enforced broken
promises, or that these were provincial cultural notions born in the
West and imposed on the world. Rather, [he criticized these]{.mark}
concepts for [being abstract]{.mark}]{.underline}, empty, disembodied,
unmediated, [and nondialectical. [It **wasn't humanism**]{.mark} or
universalism as such [but their actually **existing**]{.mark} liberal,
republican, and socialist [forms that he
challenged]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Discourse on Colonialism Césaire
imagined an alternative process of modernization whereby the communal
and democratic possibilities that had already existed within African
civilizations might have been enriched through noncoercive forms of
contact with Europe (1976: 401). Such writings mirrored his
constitutional campaigns for nonnational forms of decolonization. Both
enacted a [[radically humanist anticolonialism]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[called on colonial powers to act in partnership]{.mark} with colonized
peoples [to create plural postnational democracies that]{.mark} could
[enable]{.mark} new types of [planetary solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The affirmative allies with [anti-humanism]{.underline} by denying the [universal attributes]{.underline} of humanity and the potential for the future to change. That reflects a denial of the traditions of marginalized revolutionaries which is [all-too-easily coopted]{.underline} by reactionary forces.

To say that [[humans]{.underline}]{.mark} create is, of course, to say
they can. And that means that they [[are **free**, **have agency** and
**can do what they have not**]{.mark} **done** [in the past]{.mark}
**regardless of**, or rather **because of**, their **nature**.
Logically, then, [**transformation is possible** and the **future
open**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Humanists do not believe humans are the
only species that matters, only that it is impossible for any species to
think outside the limits of its own being -- a view that does not
preclude ethical behaviour towards other species or respect for the
natural environment. As Ludwig Feuerbach puts it in The Essence of
Christianity (1841), 'If God were an object to the bird, he would be an
object to it only as a winged being -- the bird knows nothing higher,
nothing more blissful than the state of being winged.'1 Following from
this, [the humanist contends that [**every human**, **qua human**,
**shares universal attributes**]{.mark} -- [a **vital tenet** so that
**no one** can be **relegated to a subspecies** or **denied membership
in humanity**]{.mark} on the grounds of]{.underline} his or her
**[particularities]{.underline}**.

The body of ideas called humanism was never just a set of beliefs but a
collection of contrarian intellectual practices. [[We are
talking]{.mark} not only [of]{.mark} **positions** but [**methods** and
**habits of thinking**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This aspect has been
largely lost in the post-war flight from humanism so vigorously adduced
in the pages of the present volume. It grew out of a body of study we
today call the humanities, and the current attacks on the humanities
can, to that degree, be seen as evidence of our culture's mainstream
antihumanism.

We should remember that [humanism's **early exponents** -- in **China**
and the **Arabic world**, **not only Europe** -- all expressed their
view in the form of a **project of training** in the liberal
arts]{.underline} (expressed in the West as humanitas or paideia), [and
so we are talking about a **revolution in learning** based on the
**study of books**]{.underline}, especially the forgotten wisdom of the
past, just as the present volume (we might notice) -- For Humanism -- is
involved in a similar recovery. Despite my just quoting Latin and Greek,
[the contributions to humanism are **universal** -- a view that is
**frequently denied** today]{.underline}. They can be found in the
agnosticism, scepticism towards the supernatural, and emphasis on human
choice and agency found within strains of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism,
Confucianism and Zoroastrianism.

As I have just laid them out, [[these foundations are
**obscured**]{.mark} today]{.underline} for a number of reasons, and
they contribute greatly to the confusion. For one thing, our historical
moment is a uniquely disorienting one. Biotechnology obviates the
long-standing debate over human nature [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
threatening to invent a new one according to a managerial plan. Venture
capitalists declare openly that if yesterday's economic game-changer was
0's and 1's, today's are A's, G's, T's and C's -- the bases of DNA.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} classic **[[question
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** what the human being is, then, has been gamed
by forces that seek to control it to a degree unknown in any other
historical period -- picking up where the twentieth century's
innovations in this regard left off: the manipulation of **[[libidinal
drives]{.underline}]{.mark}** by the commercial media and the merciless
incantation of official 'news' in the major Western countries which has,
many argue, short-circuited mental capacities. Between the managed
emotions of overprescribed antidepressants and social media fixations
(Twitter, Facebook) that blur the distinction between free time and
advertising, [how could it be otherwise than that **coercion** would be
**widely mistaken for freedom**, and **submission for
resistance**?]{.underline} What is Right and what is Left is no longer
clear -- and that more than any other point defines the current humanism
debate.

For Humanism is for that reason very well timed, and also for that
reason apparently untimely -- as though holding on to ideas with a warm
heart and unstifled hopes to prolong a dead (if sorely missed)
historical moment of socialist internationalism. Again, our moment is
unique. For [it is only in the last four decades that **attacks on
humanism**]{.underline} -- until then, the standard-issue views of
apologists of religious absolutism, Church censors and the reactionary
wings of modernism -- [have been thought **politically
progressive**]{.underline}. In fact, the lineages of antihumanist
thought have always been aligned with aristocratic or theocratic
privileges; or they assumed the form of apocalyptic amoralism for which
the (equally aristocratic) Marquis de Sade is usually the emblem. It was
de Sade, in fact, who by way of Georges Bataille helped bring
**[[antihumanism]{.underline}]{.mark}** into post-war theory and made it
a model of failed gods, sexual desire and a mockery of progress.2 It
[[made people **associate radical opposition with transgression** and
the **non-normative** rather than]{.mark} with **[social
transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- a realm explored in the
illuminatingly revisionist chapter on the politics of gender and sexual
desire by David Alderson in the present volume.

What For Humanism returns to, by contrast -- these rich if now neglected
mid-twentieth-century narratives of dissident humanism in figures like
Karel Kosík, Jean-Paul Sartre, Raya Dunayevaska and the Yugoslavian
Praxis group -- is part of a wider historical arc than the recent form
of the debate would have us think. This volume's genealogies remind us
just how much theory in recent decades represents an idiosyncratic
detour. It is true, as theory had charged, that humanism may have been
enlisted as a slogan of capital in its nineteenth-century colonial form
-- the technocratic fetish of managerial progress whose 'dialectic'
Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer sceptically diagnosed mid-century
-- but this was overall a co-optation. More typically it was the
groundwork of antinomians, visionaries and iconoclasts.3 In this volume,
Kevin Anderson describes how on the very heels of proclaiming
existentialism a humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre distinguished himself from
the 'liberal and republican humanism' that was theory's real and only
target. The ledgers of humanism abound, Anderson implies, with just the
opposite: struggles against religious dogma, ideas imported from other
cultures in order to curb ethnocentrism, and intellectual life brought
face to face with politics so that reality might be thought something
less to observe than make.

[The **case against humanism**]{.underline} in the post-war period
[would have us think of humanism in terms of an **exclusivist rhetoric
of innate qualities** and **character**]{.underline} found in figures
like David Hume, Jeremy Bentham and Napoleon III.
[**[Historically]{.mark}**, though, [humanism belongs]{.mark} **much
more** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the maverick secularity of Thales and
Anaxagoras, the philological study of Roman law in Varro, the
preservation of Oriental learning in [[the **Islamic Golden
age**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Averroes, Avicenna), the great rediscovery
of Egypt in Neoplatonism, the creation by scholasticism of the first
European universities, [[the **madrasas** of the **Maghreb** and the
**Levant**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the triumph of reading in the
Italian renaissance of Poggio Bracciolini and Erasmus, [the **great
philological sociologies of [ibn Khaldun]{.mark}** and
later]{.underline}, in an identical spirit[, **Giambattista
Vico**]{.underline}. The humanism of the French Revolution and, in its
wake, the young-Hegelians, especially Ludwig Feuerbach and Marx, is
usually staged as a radical fissure in history or a lamentable march
down a dead end historical lane. And yet, left Hegelianism (including
Marx) is only the continuation of a spirit of learning, of vernacular
inclusiveness and political renovation that had preceded them in Eastern
and Western antiquity.

It may be even more of a challenge to the idiosyncratic reigning story
of recent decades to recall that [the **intellectual leaders of
anticolonialism** after World War II **deployed humanist motifs
consistently** and **very consciously**]{.underline}. Edward
[**[Said]{.mark}'s well-known rallying** to the cause of
humanism]{.underline} (against the stream of theory) [grew out of a
**broader understanding** of the scholarship of]{.underline} [**George
[Makdisi]{.mark}** on the Arabic contributions to humanism and to the
revolutionary solidarities of his close friends **Eqbal [Ahmad]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}and **Mahmoud [Darwish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [He often
illustrates those commitments]{.underline}, in fact, [by
quoting]{.underline} Aimé **[[Césaire]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Notebook
on a Return to my Native Land, [where the poet **reclaims the essential
humanity** of actors, black and white, on either side of the colonial
divide at the 'rendezvous of victory', and **bitterly satirises the
antihumanist doctrines** guiding a colonial enterprise]{.underline}
propped up, as he puts it in Discourse on Colonialism, by 'chattering
intellectuals born stinking out of the thigh of Nietzsche'.4

John [[**Dewey's pragmatism**]{.mark} took shape as an effort to
**reverse the nativism** and **racial panic** of early twentieth-century
anti-immigration trends, just as [the **Brahmo
Samaj**]{.mark}]{.underline} of Tagore [[and]{.mark} others]{.underline}
in West Bengal [set out to **secularise the Hindu Right**]{.underline}
at the dawn of the Indian independence movements. M. N.
[**[Roy]{.mark}**, the co-founder of the Mexican Communist Party, and a
Bengali revolutionary who collaborated with Lenin]{.underline} on the
writing of his 'Theses on the National Question', [spent]{.underline}
the final decades of [his life building a movement **tied
to**]{.underline} an Institute at Dehradun on behalf of what he called
'a cultural-educational organization founded with the object of
re-educating the educators and young intellectuals of India in spirit
and with [the **ideas of**]{.underline} Radical (or Integral)
**[Humanism]{.underline}**'.5 By the 1950s, humanism was for Roy the
logical, secular, extra-party version of interwar Marxism.

So [[the]{.mark} **very [point of departure]{.mark}** [of antihumanism
is **politically vexed**. To **join its forces** is to **reject much
more than hypocritical Eurocentric philosophies**]{.mark} of 'progress'
[or **imperious universals**]{.mark} moulded in the image of Western
males. [It is]{.mark} rather [to **assault a centuries-long heritage of
resistance**]{.mark} and **renovation**]{.underline}. The symbolism,
then, of [the appearance of]{.underline} the locus classicus of post-war
[antihumanist thought]{.underline}, Heidegger's 'Letter on Humanism'
(1947), is notable, since it **[coincided]{.underline}** almost exactly
[with the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**]{.underline} (1948)
-- [the **most far-reaching practical statement of humanist
convictions** published in the century, and **not coincidentally
composed** by UN delegates from **Egypt**, **Chile**, **India** and
**other former colonies**. The two]{.underline} texts [stand
as]{.underline} mid-century [**antipodes** -- the former arguing
that]{.underline} 'Man \[sic\]' cannot attain his proper 'dignity' under
[humanism]{.underline} since the latter [relies on a system of logic and
values that **prove powerless** to capture the **plenitude of being**;
the latter, **codifying the universal protections necessary to safeguard
human subjects** whose particularities vis-à-vis European and American
norms had **deprived them** of the **right to well-being**, **freedom**
and **autonomy**]{.underline}. The nature of antihumanism's complaint,
though, is not exhausted by these examples, and becomes more evident in
the observation that humanism defined itself as an embrace of learning,
literature and the book traditionally associated with philology.6 Since
the 'theory' invoked in the subtitle of this volume grew out of an
extreme position on language as grammatically fixed -- to written as
opposed to spoken language -- we can begin to appreciate the motives of
this peculiar philosophical demarche. Heidegger's representative move in
'Letter on Humanism', in another flipping of the script, only appears to
protest this tyranny when he appeals to 'the liberation of language from
grammar into a more original essential framework \... reserved for
thought and poetic creation'. The freedom he has in mind is not the
inventiveness of a vernacular speech making new rules but a freedom from
'the dictatorship of the public realm', returning language to 'the house
of being' -- that is, to see the communicative and expressive means on
which all debate, discussion and sociality depends as being not about
meaning or intention but a kind of medium within which the
artist-thinker dwells.7

Heidegger's famous declaration that language speaks Man rather than the
other way around was one of the many ideas interwar phenomenology
derived from Nietzsche, although, as Barbara Epstein crucially observes
in this volume, figures like Maurice Merleau-Ponty (an important early
influence on Said) and Sartre reappropriated aspects of phenomenology
for humanist thought. And yet, in the end all modern antihumanism is
Nietzschean, expanding on or adapting his philosophy's central
principles that free choice is an illusion; that knowledge, even if it
were possible, has no 'use'; that ethics constrain Man's life-enhancing
instincts; and that 'truth' is rhetorical, language a means of artful
deception. Lying, states Nietzsche unequivocally, gives humans their
evolutionary advantage over other animals. A professional philologist,
Nietzsche's revolt was precisely aimed at his own earlier training in
the humanist tradition of letters with which he had grown disaffected.
Not learning but art, creative illusion, are the dignity of Man for him;
not making life anew but coming to admit what we are: unequal, visceral.

It is not going too far to say that understanding the contemporary
recoil from humanism is impossible without becoming familiar with
Nietzsche's thought. Antihumanism derives from him more than from any
other source -- idea for idea, word for word. It is Bataille who in the
late 1940s enshrines Nietzsche, announcing that 'Nietzsche's position is
the only one apart from communism',8 and whose fealty goes so far that
he considers himself 'the same as he'. Foucault's and Deleuze's later
efforts to claim Nietzsche for the radical Left are taken very directly,
although without acknowledgement, from Bataille's earlier experiments in
appropriating the language of the Hegelian Left for the purpose of
destroying it from within. Bataille redeploys Hegelian terms like
'totality', 'sovereignty' and 'negation' on behalf of a human subject
forced to reckon with its instinctive cruelty, its amoralism and its
illusory subjectivity. Foucault's 'death of the subject' and Deleuze's
'pure immanence' are both echoes of Bataille's already perfected
gestures.

[[Antihumanism]{.underline}]{.mark}, nevertheless, [passed through
various phases]{.underline}.9 Anthropological antihumanism, to take a
fascinating and little-known example, was a dominant aspect of culture
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, harmonising with
aspects of Nietzsche's critique. Loudly [[charging]{.mark} academic
[humanism with]{.mark} **enshrining** the '**positivist**,
**ratiocinating West**' and [**excluding Africans** and **Asians from
the human**]{.mark} as such, an **insurgent anthropology** [arose with a
**counter-method** that]{.mark} was both **intellectually appealing**
and **commercially viable**. It **[appeared radical]{.mark}** to many at
first]{.underline}, producing a large number of popular museum
exhibitions and pamphlets: 'Rather than excluding the colonised other,
anthropology would focus explicitly on societies that, all agreed, were
radically separate from narratives of Western civilisation. Instead of
studying European "cultural peoples" (Kulturvölker), societies defined
by their history and civilisation, anthropologists studied the colonised
"natural peoples" (Naturvölker).'10

As a populist discourse with the aim of displacing academic mandarins,
[anthropology **promised Germans** that they could **reinvent
themselves** along the lines of the country's **new imperial
ambitions**. [The **conquest of foreign territories** provided
antihumanism with]{.mark} its '**ethnographic [performers]{.mark}**,
**artifacts**]{.underline}, body parts, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} field
[[**sites** that]{.mark} **provided the empirical data**' and so
[**linked the imperial**, the **natural**, and the **German** in a style
of thought that **led directly** to theories of '**racial
hygiene**']{.mark}]{.underline}.11 One particularly well-known
anthropologist, Leo [[**Frobenius**, argued that '**Germans like
Africans** were]{.mark} people [of **emotion**, **intuitive reason**,
**art**, **poetry**]{.mark}, **image**, [and **myth**']{.mark}, thereby
[**establishing an antihumanist affinity** with the]{.mark} **peripheral
[subaltern]{.mark}** [that had the]{.mark} **great [merit of making
Germanness unique]{.mark}** [within]{.mark} the family of
[Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 [[A **neo-Orientalist theory of
absolute**]{.mark} **cultural** and **mental
[otherness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then, [[could **portray itself**
as]{.mark} an **[insurrectionary]{.mark} ideology** -- a minority
tendency **[reclaiming 'difference' for use against the
establishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Commitment to the universal emancipatory goals of humanism is the [only possible response]{.underline} to the growing tide of racist fascism. The aff's retreat into anti-humanist particularities [continues]{.underline} the legacy of anti-black colonialism and [leaves a vacuum open]{.underline} for reactionary forces to capture popular imaginaries.

**Byrd, 19**---associate professor of humanities, Olivet College
(Dustin, "On the Possibility of a Post-colonial Revolutionary:
Reconsidering Žižek's Universalist Reading of Frantz Fanon in the
Interregnum," *Frantz Fanon and Emancipatory Social Theory: A View from
the Wretched*, Chapter 4, pg 67-94, Brill Online, dml)

Furthermore, [[what **universal emancipatory mission** can be determined
**simply by blackness**]{.mark}; what burden can be **eternally carried
simply because of whiteness**?]{.underline} From his experiences of
Bourgeois "freedom," in Martinique, France, and colonial Algeria, Fanon
realized that ["**universal emancipation**" **cannot be viewed** (or
**fought**) **merely through the prism of race**; a **much more
comprehensive prism** is required]{.underline}: a distant messianic-like
perspective, that reveals the full totality of history as horror,
terror, suffering, alienation, and destructiveness.20 [The
**unarticulated** yet **powerful presence of pre-political
particularities** in revolutionary struggles is an **abiding
factor**]{.underline} for Fanon. For example, the Bourgeois revolution,
although made in the name of universal emancipation, proved only to be
in the interest of a segment of humanity. Having guillotined the
monarchs of Europe, the Bourgeois revolutions led only to the freedom of
the shopkeepers and the oligarchs: the aristocracy of wealth. Thus,
politically, the "demos" were in fact only those who owned the nation,
not the wretched masses who toiled and fought for the nation. The
communist revolutions, while criticizing their bourgeois forebears for
their failure to realize the promised liberté, fraternité, et equalité,
liberated the working class from material deprivation, but stripped them
of their political rights and freedoms. Such a regimented existence
resulted in Stalin's "red fascism", which deprived millions of their
lives, and many millions more from their ability to actualize their
potentials. These revolutions were hypocritical, in that they were in
service to the few (mainly European), despite the rhetoric of "universal
applicability." As such, they perpetuated the class struggle, they
perpetuated racial struggles, they perpetuated colonial domination, and
they used religion, tribe, and nationhood to divide the workers, the
peasants, the poor, and the colonial "subjects." In other words, [the
**particularity** of the Western revolutions **betrayed their stated
universality**. They were **frauds**. The claim of universality was but
the **ideological cover** for particular interests.]{.underline}

[[Even]{.mark} to the extent that it has been [**abused**,
"universality" **mustn't be abstractly negated** and **consigned** to
the **dustbin of history**]{.mark}. Rather, the **ideological fraud
perpetrated by particular interests** in the name of "**universal
emancipation**" must be **identified**, **arrested**, and **expunged**.
By **rejecting the temptation to particularize** his emancipatory
project, Fanon **avoids the fraud**]{.underline} that lay at the heart
of the bourgeois and communist revolutions in the West, thus
**[resuscitating emancipatory universalism]{.underline}**. Žižek
continues to quote Fanon,

I am not a slave to slavery that dehumanized my ancestors.

...it would be of enormous interest to discover a black literature or
architecture from the third century before Christ. We would be overjoyed
to learn of the existence of a correspondence between some black
philosopher and Plato. But we can absolutely not see how this fact would
change the lives of eight-year-old kids working in the cane fields of
Martinique or Guadeloupe.21

Here, [[Fanon **refuses to be**]{.mark} **continually [defined
by]{.mark}**[, and **trapped in**]{.mark}, the **legacy of slavery** and
**colonialism**. To **merely be concerned** with the emancipation of the
**descendants of the slaves**, **privileged above all other victims** of
history]{.underline} simply because of his personal intimacy with that
struggle, **[perpetuates [the legacy of racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
as it continues to define Fanon and his subjective concerns merely by
his Afro-Caribbean heritage and the definition thereof by white
supremacy. [By **[rejecting]{.mark}** the [privileging]{.mark} of [this
particular]{.mark} struggle, he consequently **[rejects the]{.mark}
racism** that animates this particular struggle, as from a [racist
perspective, Fanon's]{.mark} own [race **should determine his
concerns**]{.mark}, thus [**localizing him** within]{.mark}]{.underline}
the struggle of his own particularity, i.e. [[the "**black
struggle**"]{.underline}]{.mark} in Martinique, the Caribbean, or in
metropole France. [Fanon]{.underline}, no longer a "slave to the slavery
that dehumanized \[his\] ancestors," [**rejects such a diminishment** of
his humanity to **mere race**]{.underline}. "As a man," as he stated
earlier, he has to "rework the world's past from the very beginning."
[He is]{.underline} not "just responsible for the slave revolt of Saint
Dominique," but is rather, [in the **fullness of his humanity**,
concerned with **all of humanity's unjust suffering**]{.underline} --
even though that universal concern is iterated within his particular
concern for the emancipation of the subjects of France's colonial
empire.

The last sentence that Žižek quotes from Fanon's final chapter in Black
Skin, White Masks, comes oddly enough not from the last page, but rather
from the middle of the chapter. It is not Fanon's final statement in his
book, rather it is Žižek's final statement about Fanon from Fanon's
closing thoughts: an exclamation point on Žižek's argument about Fanon's
post-colonial universalism and his final rebuttal of the ghettoization
of Fanon within certain intellectual circles. He quotes him saying, "I
find myself one day in the world, and [[I acknowledge **one
right**]{.mark} for myself: the right [to **demand human behavior** from
the other]{.mark}]{.underline}."22

It is important to note that the "[[otherness]{.underline}]{.mark}" that
Fanon invokes [**lacks determination**; it **isn't bound** to any
articulated **pre-political particularity**]{.underline}. He leaves
ambiguous who the "other" is, thus implying that the other is by default
the "universal other." [Such indeterminate "otherness" [implies the
**totality of others**]{.mark}. This not only includes the **obvious
other**, those who **created the colonial condition**]{.underline}, the
European ruling classes, and the proletariats who faithfully served
their master's needs and demands, [but also the collaborators who
**share**]{.underline} Fanon's own **[pre-political
foundations]{.underline}**. By [universalizing the "other,"]{.underline}
Fanon implies that he [**stands with all the wretched of the earth**,
even amidst]{.underline} his abiding [concern for those presently in
front of him]{.underline}. Thus, in standing with the wretched, he takes
sides; his universal solidarity is paradoxically particularized. It is
universally with the victims of history, not the triumphant victors, who
remain outside of his immediate concern. From Fanon's body of work, we
can see that there is no meaningful "solidarity" with those African,
Caribbean, Middle Eastern, and Asian ruling-classes, just because they
belong to a pre-political foundation that has been historically
mistreated, marginalized, and exploited by European empires.23 Along
with the European and Euro-American ruling-classes, such non-white
ruling classes (the "native elite") are engaged in the oppression,
suppression, exploitation, and genocidal destruction of the wretched,
even though, as Jean-Paul Sartre pointed out, they too are often
manufactured by the European elites.24 Thus Fanon's solidarity with the
other is not completely universalized, as it remains anchored in the
framework of class struggle. He is, by this logic, universally concerned
with the wretched of the earth, not the wretched-makers of the palaces,
penthouses, and parliaments.

But by what right does Fanon have [[to "**demand human
behavior**"]{.mark} from the other]{.underline}? This too [can be argued
**within a universalistic framework**, as the "**human**"]{.underline}
within "human behavior" [is **fully universal**, **encompassing all
within the species**]{.underline}. As such, [on the principle of
equality, it **[demands something from all]{.mark}** of those within the
bounds of humanity, [as it is **prepared to reciprocate to all**]{.mark}
within those bounds]{.underline}. Without spelling out succinctly what
he means by "human behavior," [one can rightly assume from any number of
sources]{.underline} what [he means]{.underline}:
[**[mutual-recognition]{.mark}**, **inter-subjective
[respect]{.mark}**[, **equal moral consideration**]{.mark}]{.underline},
etc. [[This]{.mark} demand, which [**exempts no individual**, **group**,
**race**, or **class**, **regardless** of their **pre-political
foundations**]{.mark}, is a **universal demand** that Fanon]{.underline}
not only rhetorically advanced, but [was **willing to shed blood
for**]{.underline}, as the Algerians were not his people (according to
pre-political foundations), but like the Argentinian Che Guevara and the
Cubans, he made their liberation his cause as part of a broader
revolutionary project. Žižek rightly includes Fanon's statement here as
his exclamation mark precisely because of this point; [that]{.underline}
final statement [is Fanon's demand for **universal justice** and
**emancipation**, within which belongs the **long** and **brutal
struggle** for the **rights**, **respect**, and **equality** of the
non-European wretched of the earth]{.underline}. As such, [Fanon is
**not merely a Martiniquais**, a **male**, of **African descent**, or a
**revolutionary in North Africa**, but one that **represents the
struggle for universal emancipation** within the **particular
struggles** in which he participated]{.underline}: the post-colonial
revolutionary.

3 Ideological Perversion of Universalism: the Truth as Lie's Camouflage

While we can argue that Fanon places an emphasis of universal
emancipation throughout his writings, especially in his Black Skin,
White Masks, [[it would be **wrong** to assume]{.mark} that [**all
appeals** to the "**universal**" are
**emancipatory**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Take]{.underline} for
example the Black Lives Matter movement. When the phrase "Black Lives
Matter" is not countered with the phrase "Black Lives Don't Matter"
Rather, it is countered with the phrase "[**[All Lives
Matter]{.underline}**."]{.mark} [Such rendering of the universal [is
**ideological camouflage**]{.mark}. It is **clear** that the former
phrase "**[Black Lives Matter]{.mark}**" is a **particular
claim**]{.underline}, rooted in the black erlebnis (traumatic
experience) of American history.25 In essence, [it [means]{.mark} that
[black folk **warrant moral consideration**, **respect**, and the
**fullness of rights**]{.mark} due to all citizens]{.underline}, and
that the systematic violence of the police against young black men is an
egregious violation of those values. [**[Implicit]{.mark}ly** within the
particular claim [is the **universal claim**; black lives matter **just
as much as any other**]{.mark} **lives**, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} as
such, black lives [[**should be incorporated** into the **universal
concern for human life**]{.mark}. Nevertheless, [the **ideological
function** of]{.mark} saying "[**All Lives Matter**" is to
**neutralize**]{.mark} the [reality]{.mark} of the particular. It is as
if to say, "your suffering **matters**, but it matters **no more than
any other groups' suffering**." [This]{.mark}]{.underline} of course
[[is **true on the one hand**; concern for]{.mark} the
[suffering]{.mark} of the finite individual [has **universal
significance**]{.mark}, **regardless of time**, **place**, **race**,
**religion**, etc. However, within a **given context**, [wherein one
group is]{.mark} **systematically [oppressed]{.mark}**]{.underline},
historically under-served, [the subject of **random violence** and
**subjugation**, **[denied]{.mark} their human** and **civil
[rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as well as
**[[dehumanized]{.underline}]{.mark}** and demonized, [[the]{.mark}
**secret intention** of the universal [claim]{.mark} becomes
**apparent**: it [is]{.mark} an attempt to **bury the grotesque
reality** of the particular underneath the truth of the universal, thus
**[denying the immediacy of black suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Truth itself is **ideologically appropriated** and **functionalized**,
resulting in an **intentional distortion** of truth]{.underline}. It is
an attempt to use the universal claim to conceal their own
"negrophobia," by distorting the particular claim into appearing to
privilege the particular over the universal, which in reality it does
not.26

Additionally, elevating the false-universal ideologically transforms
those who are not the historical subject of imperialism and colonialism
into "victims," giving them a share in the "privilege of the victim" --
the right, legitimacy, and authority to speak from the perspective of
one who has been systemically and systematically wronged. From a White
Nationalist perspective, the white population in the West is the victim
of "modernity" (the creation of white liberals and Jews), for it has
lost its own civilization, land, and culture to foreigners. Thus, in
elevating the false-universal, in which the White Nationalist can claim
victimhood on behalf of the entire West, they augment their ideological
claim; they too can speak with authority against the crimes of their
oppressors: Blacks, Muslims, immigrants, refugees, and other
marginalized groups within the West.

[Such functionalization of the universal **must be rejected**, as it
**fundamentally distorts** and **disfigures the emancipatory intention**
of the universal claim for the benefit of the]{.underline} unjust,
unequal, and necrophilic [status quo, while rendering the truth of the
particular moot. [The **unifying essence** of the universal claim **must
be preserved** in its **undistorted state**, as it]{.mark} is what
**[produces]{.mark} universal solidarity** amongst the global
wretched]{.underline}. As Fanon stated, "[I am fighting for the **birth
of a human world**]{.underline}, in other words, [a world of
**[reciprocal recognitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}."27

4 Post-colonial Mind

European [[colonialism]{.mark} **ideologically [defined]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}the colonial subject as merely a **small conglomerate of
[particularities]{.mark}**[; the slave was
**merely**]{.mark}]{.underline} "a **[[black]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
merely "a woman" or "a breeder," merely "a beast of burden," a mere
piece of "**[[property]{.underline}]{.mark}**," merely [[a "**living
tool**."]{.underline}]{.mark} Being such, [the "colonized mind," which
**absorbed the imposed mere-ness**, **could not escape the degradation**
of the **mere particularities**]{.underline}; they were enchained within
them, both in the colonizers' law, and more painfully, in their damaged
psyche.28 [Universalism, to be able to **think beyond the immediate**,
beyond the **given**]{.underline}, beyond the isolated appearances, with
few exceptions, [was not a trait that the merely particular **could
easily ascend to**]{.underline}, especially when they were overwhelmed
by their own particular experiences of oppression. Who could fault the
American slave for not concerning himself/herself with the plight of
European Serfs or the Aboriginals in Australia? Their world was brutally
immediate and overwhelming, and they struggled to maintain their own
existence on a daily basis. Universal thought, we can deduce, was the
privilege of those who could afford, in time and resources, universal
thought, not those struggling to survive daily whippings, rape,
starvation, depravations, and torture, both psychological and physical.
[Because they **appeared** to not think beyond the immediate, it was
assumed the wretched were "**incapable**" of thinking. Thus, **abstract
thought**, we are **told**]{.underline} by the master-class, [was the
work of the **superior**, the **colonial masters**]{.underline}, the
metropole: the civilizational übermenschen. [Yet this was **merely a
reflection** of the way society was **constructed** and
**maintained**]{.underline}: the masters and the slaves; the oppressor
and the oppressed; the exploiter and the exploited. [[Fanon, by
**rejecting**]{.mark} the enslavement of humanity to the pre-determined
"capabilities" associated with **[pre-political foundations]{.mark}**,
which were **ideologically created** by the master-classes, also
[**rejected the racist ideologies** that attempt to **chain him**
to]{.mark} the **[mere-ness]{.mark}** of the **colonized** and
**enslaved subject**]{.underline}.29 Thus, he reclaims his full humanity
when he, in Žižek's words, "dealt intensively \[with European
philosophy\] and was proud of it... he dealt extensively with Hegel,
psychoanalysis, Sartre, even Lacan."30 To be sure, [his humanity was not
reclaimed because the philosophy he dealt with was **predominately
European**]{.underline}: European philosophy has no such elevating
power; it couldn't even compel Europe to realize its own humanistic
ideals, values, and principles. Rather, [it was because he
**transcended** that which European colonialism **defined him as** --
**simple mere-ness**]{.underline}. Such imposed mere-ness would not have
allowed him the possibility of engaging intensely with the philosophy of
the "superior civilization," for the "natural capability" for a Black
man to engage such thought was denied in fact (via self-interested
policies), and denied in theory (via legitimating ideologies).31 That he
mastered, expanded upon, and applied Europe's Marxist and existentialist
philosophy, that by his race he was supposed to be incapable of, and
determinately negated it into his own revolutionary philosophy, is both
poetic justice and the forceful dissolution of a racist ideology that
says a Black man is incapable of such thought. Thus, [[what helped
him]{.mark} realize the fullness of humanity [was]{.mark} his **ascent
to the universal** -- in his case, the [**universal concern** for
matters **beyond**]{.mark} **the [mere-ness]{.mark}** that his subaltern
status was **meant to cage him in**]{.underline}. And [[like **Toussaint
L'Ouverture**]{.mark}**'s revolution**]{.underline} in Haiti from 1791
to 1794, **[[Denmark Vesey]{.mark}'s rebellion]{.underline}** in South
Carolina in 1822, **[[Nat Turner]{.mark}'s rebellion]{.underline}** in
Virginia in 1831, [**[Frederick Douglass]{.mark}** and his fight
with]{.underline} the "slave-breaker" [Edward Covey, **[MOVE
Organization]{.mark}'s standoffs**]{.underline} with the Philadelphia
Police Department, [and **many other revolts** against oppression,
Fanon's participation in the violent struggle for a people's
emancipation **concretely liberated him** from such mere-ness, as the
dignity of the struggle itself relieved him of the master's dehumanizing
ideology.]{.underline}

[In **transcending the mere-ness** of the colonial mind, along with an
**embracing** and **adopting the universal concern**, Fanon **invented
his own subjectivity**]{.underline}: his own "post-colonial mind." [He
was]{.underline} not an imperfect Black copy of the European colonial,
but rather [a **universal man demanding universal humanity** from the
rest of humanity]{.underline}. In such an emancipated state, [he saw how
the struggle for human liberation in his Caribbean island was
**intimately tied** with the struggle for emancipation in **Europe**, in
**Vietnam**, in **Africa**, even in the **slums** and **prisons of North
America**]{.underline}, wherein the hypocrisy of the Liberal Bourgeois
"revolution" is intimately felt every day. As such, he rejected what
Žižek called "Baudrillard's battle cry: forget Europe," for forgetting
Europe was no more possible then forgetting any other part of the earth
wherein the wretched are made.32

5 Reversing Fanon in the Interregnum: the New Colonial Project

In the last decade, especially with the election of Barack Obama and the
"white-lash" election of his nationalist and faux-populist successor,
Donald J. Trump, a virulent form of fascism, rooted in a longing for
racial "retrotopia" -- yet clothed in the aesthetics and technology of
the 21st century -- has made its loud appearance on the world-historical
stage, both in the United States and in Europe.33 This strain of
fascism, or "Alt-Fascism" as we're describing it here, is a
re-articulation of what the British political theorist Roger Griffin
describes as palingenetic ultra-nationalism. It is rooted partly in
neo-liberal economic anxiety, post-modern nihilism, cultural alienation
within multiculturalism, the fear of "white genocide," and the assumed
culture of political correctness, which, according to White
Nationalists, represses obvious "truths" in the name of "cultural
sensitivity." According to Griffin, such palingenetic ultra-nationalist
movements also includes the "forces \[of\] militarism, racism,
charismatic leadership, \[and\] populist nationalism."34 It is
determined by "fears that the nation or civilization as a whole \[is\]
being undermined by the forces of decadence," and is plagued with a
"deep anxiety about the modern age and longing for a new era to
begin."35 In addition to these ingredients, what has forcefully birthed
fascism back in to the public sphere is the growing fear of Le grand
remplacement (The Great Replacement), which is understood by far-right
traditionalists, paleo-conservatives, and White Nationalists as being
the inevitable outcome of the Liberal-Socialist pro-immigration agenda
-- one that works to the advantage of immigrants at the expense of white
natives.36 The xenophobic fear of being replaced has once again mutated
into an irrational hatred for all things perceived to be "other" -- for
the other is the agent of the demise of the white "natives."

Coined by the French polemical author, Renaud Camus, the "great
replacement" theory, as it pertains to France, argues that the "ethnic
French," those belonging to the historical community of France and their
matrix of pre-political foundations, will inevitably be replaced by
those who lack such an ethnic foundation for their French identity,
predominately the immigrants of Northern Africa and the Middle East.37
Such critics argue that the Bourgeois Enlightenment's (as well as
post-colonial liberals') preference for jus soli (right of the soil, or
"birthright citizenship") over the pre-political jus sanguinis (right of
blood), which limits citizenship to those who share in the pre-political
matrix of a historical "blood-bound" nation (volksgemeinschaft), is the
Trojan Horse that allows the ethnically and culturally non-French to
claim French citizenship. In obtaining political citizenship, these
foreign "outsiders" claim that their cultural "otherness" is also
rightfully considered French, for within the post-modern condition,
"Frenchness" is without content, and thus merely formal. Consequently,
all manner of things can find an equal home within this post-modern
amorphic "French," which renders "Frenchness" meaningless, as it has no
distinguishable substance; it is just an empty form. As such, the
"intentional democratic community," the willensgemeinschaft, comprised
of representatives of all nations and cultures claiming "Frenchness," is
the conceptual flank for these "invaders" to destroy what is left of
historic French cultural and genetic particularity. Without the strength
of French cultural particularity, France becomes incapable of asserting
its identity against the so-called "hordes of invaders." Thus,
pre-modern traditional French culture, the basis of French identity,
they believe, is dying a slow and agonizing death under the weight of
multiculturalism, with the ultimate outcome of France being replaced by
a cultural amalgamation: Eurabia.38

Fanon himself wrote about the process of déculturation in his book
Toward the African Revolution, when he discussed the colonial power's
ability to strip native peoples of their sense of self, their identity,
their cultural patterns, and systems of reference, all through
systematic racism. He writes, the "racialized group tries to imitate the
oppressor and thereby to deracialize itself. The 'inferior race' denies
itself as a different race. It shares with the 'superior race' the
convictions, doctrines, and other attitudes concerning it."39 In the
perspective of Alt-Fascists, a similar yet perverted process is
happening among Whites in the West. Because of white-guilt, i.e.
ethnomasochism, Whites attempt to deracialize themselves by imitating
the culture of their former colonial subjects, by adopting their
cultural patterns and systems of reference (negrification). In this
case, it is not the "inferior race" that "denies itself as a race," but
rather the "guilty race" that "denies itself as a race," for in
deracializing itself, it absolves itself of the sins of its colonial
forefathers, the knowledge of which is repeatedly hammered into the
younger generation by ethnomasochistic educators. In this process,
European hochkultur (high culture) is replaced by African-inspired pop
culture, pushed by the power of the lügenpresse (lying press), resulting
in the evaporation of Europe's primordial identity and traditional
culture. As Fanon knew, déculturation, or Umvolkung ("de-people-ing" in
German), is a way of making space between a people and their historical
culture, thus depriving them of the vital resources needed to maintain
their distinct identity and resist capitulation to the colonial invader.
Without such a strong sense of self, the invader can impose upon them
the identity of their choosing, which is always a submissive and
subservient identity. From the perspective of the anti-immigrant
Far-Right, überfremdung (over-foreignization), leads to déculturation,
which is a precondition for the subaltern to replace their former
masters in the former masters' own fatherland.

For the White Nationalists, it is not just the liberal-bourgeois state
of France, or in immigrant friendly Germany, that are now under the
threat of losing their historic (and racial) identity, but the entire
West is threatened by post-modern "globalism."40 The West, it is
charged, exports its nihilistic consumerist culture and neo-liberal
economic system abroad while it imports its population from the tiers
monde (third world), thus destroying both the Third World and the First
World. True multiculturalism, it is argued, is the opposite of the form
of multiculturalism found within the pluralist democracies of the West;
it is leaving traditional cultures intact within their traditional
geographical boundaries: the sovereign and "pure" ethno-states. For the
Alt-Fascists, the right not to have a people's traditional culture
undermined by a foreign culture includes modern Europe. Thus, the "world
of reciprocal recognition," as Fanon so desired, is assented to by the
Alt-Fascists, but it is a world wherein people do not interpenetrate
each other territorially.41 Rather, this imagined world is governed
bi-laterally through sovereign nation-states (in the strict biological
sense of the phrase), whose membership within the nation-state is
determined by pre-political foundations. As it would be a transgression
of the biologically determined nation-state for an individual to become
a citizen of another nation-state, individuals do not go beyond their
historical geographical borders. It is the end of the
willensgemeinschaft. As such, mutual-reciprocity and mutual-recognition
is a matter between the ethnically bound nation-states, not individuals
of different ethnic, religious, and racial groups cohabitating within
one state.

Being against such cultural and racial interpenetration, the
Alt-Fascists criticize neo-liberal capitalist globalization -- the
economics of modernity, as it is capitalism's relentless pursuit of
profit that forces cultures to interpenetrate each other, either through
immigration, business partnerships, pursuit of education, and the
inevitable brain-drain from the Third World to the First World. This, it
is argued, undermines each peoples' eigentlichkeit (authenticity), and
therefore it must be replaced with an economic system that allows
various nation-states to remain undisturbed by the influences of foreign
cultures.

In addition to neo-liberal capitalism, Alt-Fascists criticize Marxism,
socialism, and other forms of Left-wing "globalist" thought, for it too
diminishes Western cultural superiority to the level of the inferior
others, all in the name of "egalitarianism."42 From the perspective of
the Alt-Fascists, equality, as such, is unjust, as it fails to recognize
the genius -- and thus superiority -- of the West. By operating on the
principle of equality of cultures, the Left gives equal space within
Western societies to foreign and "degenerate" cultures, thus weakening
the West's ability to stabilize, rejuvenate, and reproduce its own
identity (and biology). Additionally, the insistence on equality of
peoples is an affront to the psychological well-being of those who see
themselves as superior, as it denies the very the uplifting yet
false-consciousness that gives them a sense of superiority:
"superiority" being a psychological defense mechanism against their own
sense of insecurity, alienation, and isolation.43

Within the "interregnum" between modernity and the rise of
post-modernity, White Nationalists, Nationalist Populists,
Paleoconservatives, Traditionalists, Archeofuturists, and other
Alt-Fascists, have appropriated Fanon's insights into colonialism and
its psychological destructiveness. They seek to demonstrate how the
descendants of Europe's colonial subjects have returned to the
metropoles, and with the help of Cultural Marxists, Liberals, Jews, and
non-conforming left-wing intellectuals (the "collaborators," or European
"native elites" to use a Fanonian phrase), have begun to colonize
liberal Europe under the cover of equality, tolerance, and diversity.
While such a "colonization" is a catastrophe for European civilization
as a distinct civilization, its death culminates in a palingenetic
opportunity: the creation of a stronger and more vibrant Europe: The
Fourth Age of European Civilization, as the New Right philosopher
Guillaume Faye calls it.44 In order to avoid civilization death via
"involution" -- the regression of civilization due to dysgenic forces --
and bring about this rebirth of Europe, Europeans must, according to
Faye, "unite in self-defense, expel the colonizers, throw off the
American yoke, and regenerate themselves biologically and morally."45
Anything less than a totalen krieg (total war) against their invading
foreigners will leave Europe vulnerable to complete colonization, and
colonization means collapse -- a dystopic and apocalyptic end to a
distinctly Christian-inheritance Enlightenment civilization.

Although immigration of Muslims and Africans is seen as the primary
dysgenic force in Europe, various Alt-Fascists have once again seized
upon a familiar target: Der Jude (The Jew). The Jewish community plays a
particularly insidious role in this new iteration of White Nationalism.
In his essay "The Populist Temptation," Slavoj Žižek shed light on this
new formulation of anti-Semitism. First, Žižek rejects the idea that the
Muslims are the "new Jews" of Europe, as some on the Left have claimed.
Rather, he argues, Der Jude is seen now, as was before, as being the
"secret master that pulls the strings."46 While it was the strings of
international finance, the media, and pop culture, that the Jews pulled
in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, today, his work is done primarily
through immigration. Žižek writes, "if one suspects a secret plot in
their \[the Muslims\] 'invasion of Europe,' then Jews have to be behind
it," since the Muslims are "too visible" and "clearly not integrated
into our societies."47 By way of his social invisibility, "the Jew" is
undetected as he makes Europe comfortable for his own existence by
transforming Europe into a "multicultural dystopia" akin to the United
States. Through this unseen string pulling, he slowly removes the
particularity of Europe; he subjects its economy to global forces; he
denigrates Europe hochkultur (high culture) with dysgenic pop-culture
(negrification); he fills its cities with people who do not belong to
Europe, cannot integrate with its people, nor assimilate its libertine
(or its traditional) culture. In doing so, the Jew, who is otherwise the
perpetual other, creates the conditions for his own flourishing at the
expense of the native.48 Additionally, through liberal institutions, he
has removed Europe's ability to remove him.49

From the perspective of White Nationalists, Jews can blend in European
society, but they cannot be absorbed or integrated into the distinct
geist of Europe, with its Christian inheritance, no matter how
diminished that geist is. Thus, they must ally themselves with those who
have the ability to deconstruct that geist: The Muslims. Anything
outside of this complete deconstruction of European distinctiveness
leaves Europe's small Jewish community vulnerable to a new and more
complete Endlösung (final solution): the absolute integration of the
Jews via extermination of the Jews. Thus, in order to secure their own
existence, Europe must become Americanized -- a hodgepodge of peoples
without clearly defined cultural inheritances.

Žižek is right to point out here the dangerous nature of this new form
of Alt-Fascism; it successfully combines Islamophobia and traditional
Anti-Semitism. The Muslims are the weapons used against the Europeans
and the Jews are the agents through which the "invading hordes"
accomplish their colonizing task. Through their demographics, such a
Jewish-Muslim alliance will conquer Europe and colonize it under the
guise of multiculturalism and cultural Marxism, which will inevitably
lead to "white genocide."50 Although the legitimacy of this claim is
dubious, it is not unbelievable among those who've experienced the
growing Muslim presence in Europe as, to use Fanon's word, an erlebnis.

6 Erlebnis as Civilizational Trauma; Retrotopia as Ersatz Utopia

[In discussing]{.underline} the **[psychopathology]{.underline}** of the
Black Man in Black Skin, White Masks, [Fanon quotes Freud's
understanding of]{.underline} the lasting effects of
[trauma]{.underline} on the psyche, as being the basis of an
individual's neuroses.51 Since here we are not speaking of one single
individual, but rather a collectivity of individuals -- Western society
-- [we can]{.underline} philosophically appropriate this concept from
Freud/Fanon and [apply it to the **traumatic experience of modernity**
and how it has **contributed to the conditions** from which Alt-Fascism
**becomes a credible alternative** in the eyes of otherwise rational
Westerners]{.underline}.

Fanon quotes Freud as saying that the symptoms associated with an
erlebnis are the "residue of emotional experiences... psychic traumas,"
that are not always caused by a "single event," but on the contrary,
arise from "multiple traumas, frequently analogous and repeated."52
Thus, says Fanon, "there is a determined Erlebnis at the origin of every
neurosis."53 [[The West is]{.mark} currently [suffering
from]{.mark}]{.underline} such [a **[neurosis]{.mark}**. On the one
hand, [it]{.mark} **publically [remains committed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
the [values]{.mark} of the Enlightenment, [while]{.mark} at the same
time it [**doubts** whether]{.mark} or not [those]{.mark} values [can
**keep**]{.mark} **an increasingly disparate [people
together]{.mark}**[. Those who **advocate for an
ethno-state**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like Greg Johnson, Jared Taylor, and
Wilmot Robertson, [[have **seized on this**]{.mark} **troubling
fissure**]{.underline}. According to Greg Johnson,

ethnonationalism is contrasted with civic nationalism, in which the
principle of unity is subjection to a common system of laws or the
profession of a shared civic creed. Civic nationalism need not exist in
a multiracial or multicultural society, but the primary reason that
civic nationalist creeds are promulgated is to deal with the absence of
organic, ethnic unity in a society.54

If the liberal willensgemeinschaft is to remain intact, it must replace
what it lacks -- "organic" or "ethnic unity" -- with some other form of
social adhesive. This is usually done with civic religion, national
myths, and political institutions and ideologies. However, [globalized
modernity]{.underline} has (1) revealed the limits of such sources of
social unity, (2) eroded what is left of those sources, and (3) [has
constructed a political-economic and cultural reality that is
**perceived**]{.underline} by the Western precariat [to be **incapable**
of being solved by **such liberal sources**]{.underline}. The traumatic
erlebnis of modernity has ruptured the modern Westerners from their
"organic" and "ethnic unity"; it has severed it from its Christian
cultural inheritance; the ravages of aggressive neo-liberal capitalism
have undermined its own promise of working class prosperity; and its
scientism, metaphysical materialism, instrumental reason, pervasive
nihilism, and necrophilic consumerism as a comprehensive
way-of-being-in-the-world, have ciphered any sense of inherent
meaningfulness and hopefulness in life. [[In this **existential void**,
many]{.mark} in the West have sought to]{.underline} overcome the
civilizational entzauberung (disenchantment) and [**recover** their
"**lost utopia**" with]{.underline} its ersatz:
**[retrotopia]{.underline}**.

According to the Polish philosopher Zygmunt Bauman, [retrotopias exist
when societies **[abandon their confidence in future progress]{.mark}**,
when societies in decline **no longer look forward**]{.underline} to the
"not-yet-born," but begin to look backwards in nostalgia towards an
imaged ideal type of the status quo ante (the way it used to be), before
modernity brought about the polyethnic, multicultural, and dispersed
society.55

In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon reminds us that in "every society, in
every community, there exists, must exist, a channel, an outlet whereby
the energy accumulated in the form of aggressiveness can be released."56
In the 21st century post-secular and multicultural societies of Europe,
such accumulated aggressiveness has been filtered through palingenetic
ultra-nationalism and directed towards a singular ideologically
constructed culprit: The Immigrant/Refugee, the "invading hordes"
determined to colonize Europe.57 Whilst retrotopia remains aspirational,
a mere ersatz meant to satisfy the longing for an idealized past age,
[[when such aspirations **take concrete form**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
citizen groups in civil society, [and metastasize]{.underline} into
political parties determined to take power, [then [the **retrotopian
vision**]{.mark} of a **purified** and **authentic society** [becomes
a]{.mark} **great [danger]{.mark}** [to those]{.mark} who are
**[outside]{.mark}** of the "**in-group**" dynamic: the **unintegrated**
and **unassimilated other**]{.underline} -- especially those who
nevertheless claim "westernality" despite their abiding otherness.
Through palingenetic ultra-nationalism, the West engages in the
"collective catharsis," which Fanon believed "every society naturally
acquir\[es\]."58 Thus, [the struggle to **actualize the retrotopic
vision** of a future society is the way the West "**defends**" itself
from]{.underline} the colonizing project of [the **immigrants** and
**refugees**. It is the bringing forth of the
**Ragnarök**]{.underline}.59

7 Beyond the Flaschenpost: the Call for the Post-colonial Revolutionary

The Frankfurt School's post-World War ii critical theory of society,
especially its analyses of nationalism, authoritarianism, and
anti-Semitism, was meant to be a flaschenpost -- a "message in a bottle"
-- for those who mistakenly believed that such forces had been defeated.
According to Leo Löwenthal, one of the early members of the Frankfurt
School, the flaschenpost arose in the aftermath of World War i, "out of
the feeling that one could contribute to change, that the message would
get through to the right people, that possibilities would once again
arise."60 Indeed, such possibilities did arise again, as fascism,
responding to the failures of liberalism and the threat of Soviet
communism, brought upon World War ii, the greatest of world-historical
catastrophes. Yet, what people optimistically thought was finally
destroyed in World War ii, fascism, was only destroyed militarily. As a
political philosophy, it was merely repressed, awaited the right
opportunity -- the right time for another "collective catharsis" -- to
explode back onto the canvas of history, albeit in a new "alternative"
form.

In the interregnum between modernity and post-modernity, [[with]{.mark}
the **collapse of the socialist Left** as a world-historical force, and
[the **reemergence of** ]{.mark}**virulent**]{.underline} forms of
palingenetic [[**ultra-nationalism**, it is time for]{.mark} the
**post-colonial [revolutionaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}, those
[[committed to **universal emancipation**]{.mark}, to once again **take
their places among the barricades**. The post-colonial revolutionary --
those revolutionaries [who've **emancipated themselves** from]{.mark}
their **[pre-political foundations]{.mark} as limiting
factors**]{.underline} in their revolutionary politics -- [are
**uniquely qualified** for this struggle]{.underline}. For the
"colonial" and "anti-colonial" struggle is no longer happening in the
tiers monde (at least not according to the Alt-Fascists), but rather it
is happening in the West, which is comprised of numerous post-secular
societies that are multiethnic and multi-confessional. [Building
**bridges** and [**bonds** between]{.mark} the various marginalized
[communities, as **opposed** to defining]{.mark} their struggle **simply
[on the basis]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} their communities'
[**particularities**, is]{.mark} **absolutely [necessary]{.mark}** [if
the push to **eradicate the non-integrative "other"**]{.mark} from the
society [is to be **halted**]{.mark}, if Fanon's **truly human world**,
"a world of **reciprocal recognitions**," is to come
about]{.underline}.61

[[Liberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} has shown itself to be incapable of
realizing its own "universal" creed (Liberté, Equalité, and Fraternité);
it has shown that it [[will]{.mark} **continue to [produce]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} very political, economic, and cultural
[[conditions that **call for its own destruction** -- either by a
**reactionary**]{.mark} **retrotopian [move]{.mark}**, which **comes [at
the expense]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} all [those who **cannot be
integrated**]{.mark} into the **singular identity** of the imagined
community, [or]{.mark} through a post-modernity that **seeks as its goal
the reconciliation** of the **fundamental antagonisms** that currently
plague humanity -- **class**, **race**, **gender**, **culture**, **not**
through the **dissolution of human differences**]{.underline} through
haphazard amalgamation, [but [through a **radical realization of
humanity's oneness within its differences**]{.mark}: Its **E pluribus
unum**]{.underline}. Fanon's **[universalism]{.underline}**, his
commitment to the wretched of the earth, which Žižek highlighted in his
Birkbeck lecture, [is]{.underline} a prime example of what is
[**needed** in today's **disfigured** and **distorted social
relations**. It is **not time to retreat**]{.underline} with Fanon [into
our **own local struggles**; rather, it is time to]{.underline} invoke
Fanon in those struggles, and **[connect]{.underline}** them [with the
**broader struggle for human emancipation**]{.underline}. Divide et
impera, (divide and conquer) the Romans used to say; it would be foolish
if we let Fanon be functionalized as a tool for that division.

#### Afro-pessimism incorrectly conflates "Man" and "Human", ignoring that black resistance has long been premised on a radical retrieval of the Human against the violent category of the Bourgeois Man\-\--this theoretical occlusion produces a falsely uniform account of black struggle that lets humanist resistance seem like part of the afro-pessimist project

Greg **Thomas 18**, Associate Prof. of English at Tufts University,

*Theory & Event,* Vol. 21, No. 1, p. 300-303

The subtitle of Wynter\'s essay on the \"coloniality of being, power,
truth, and freedom\" is \"Towards the Human, After Man, Its
Overrepresentation---An Argument.\" How could the \"new\" articulation
of the old \"Afro-pessimism\" fail for so long to engage the epic
critical oeuvre of such an epic Black intellectual figure, while
claiming to explore these precise questions of Blackness and \"the
Human,\" to boot? If much or most of Fanon is quarantined by
Afro-pessimism (2.0), its evasion of her has long had the air of a kind
of a boycott. Though her transcontinental Black intellectual career
begins in dance and theatre as well as literature including a landmark
novel, The Hills of Hebron (1962), she launches her tradition of the
epic critical essay perhaps \[End Page 300\] more or less midstream. One
might date it from \"The Ceremony Must Be Found: After Humanism\" (1984)
and note its enduring continuation in \"The Ceremony Found: Toward the
Autopoetic Turn/Overturn, Its Autonomy of Human Agency and
Extraterritoriality of (Self-) Cognition\" (2015), one of her most
recent publications. There is also \"Beyond the Word of Man\" (1989) in
addition to \"Beyond Miranda\'s Meanings\" (1990), where Wynter exposes
liberalism, Marxism as well as feminism as mere \"sub/versions\" (or
subordinate versions) of Western \"Man\" or \"humanism.\" She wrote \"No
Humans Involved: An Open Letter to My Colleagues\" (1992) after the
\"Rodney King\" controversy of white police terror in Los Angeles while
still teaching at Stanford University or in the same state as the
principal neo-pessimists of the University of California system. The
quincentennial of Colombian pseudo-discovery was analyzed in \"1492: A
New World View\" (1995), whose title alone highlights the Anglo-American
provincialism of Afro-pessimism (2.0). [These [pessimists]{.mark}
analytically [bind]{.mark} \"[race\" and \"slavery\"]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the [pre- and post-1865]{.mark} space of the white US state with neither
Black anti-colonialism nor Black anti-imperialism nor pan-African Black
internationalism in evidence.]{.underline} Wynter\'s interview with
David Scott in Small Axe is entitled \"The Re-Enchantment of Humanism\"
(2000). Whereas her interview with PROUD FLESH coincides with her focus
in the same year for \"On How We Mistook the Map for the Territory and
Re-Imprisoned Ourselves in Our Unbearable Wrongness of Being: Black
Studies Toward the Human Project\" (2006). Her acceptance letter for the
Order of Jamaica she was awarded in 2010 invokes her \"After Man, Toward
the Human\" conception which necessarily moves beyond \"the now globally
hegemonic Western European secular and thereby naturalized understanding
of being human.\"54 Other [scholars may begin of late to put a few
citations of her \"in vogue]{.underline},\" academically speaking, for
chic, \"neo-niggerati\" [postures within disciplines]{.underline} and
\"inter-disciplines\" [very much against her own, actual intellectual
practice.]{.underline} Yet, remarkably, [Sexton does not
discover]{.underline} two [pieces by her]{.underline} in print [until
2016---for a mere footnote]{.underline} problematic in multiple
respects:55 Wynter remains an overwhelmingly unread and unrecognized
epic for this Afro-pessimism, its chief proponents in particular.

Still, [[there are]{.mark} **colossal and [irreconcilable
differences]{.mark}** [between Wynter\'s]{.mark} life-[work on
humanism]{.mark}]{.underline}---a \"project\" of \"human
being\"---[[and]{.mark} their belated [pessimism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As she pinpoints time and again, [[her]{.mark} critical [target is
\"Man.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Wilderson and company play with]{.mark}
the category of \"[the Human]{.mark}\" but demonstrate no literacy in
the comprehensive history and discourse of Western \"Man]{.underline},\"
as such, [and certainly not as a decidedly bourgeois epistemic
discourse]{.underline} in the present day. [[They **casually
conflate**]{.mark} this \"[Man\" with \"the Human\"]{.mark}
that]{.underline} they criticize, rhetorically and discursively, [as
much as Wynter has insisted upon the]{.underline} \[End Page 301\]
[radical distinction between \"Man\" and \"the Human\" as the heart of
the matter at hand.]{.underline} [The \"Man\" she targets is not \"the
Human\" at all.]{.underline} It represents (or \"over-represents\")
itself as if it were \"the Human\"---in order to deny any projected
humanity of others, its \"Human Others\" so to speak. This is her
sermonizing refrain. [[Under the West, \"Man\" wants and needs to be
taken for \"the Human,\" and \"Afro-pessimisms\"
oblige]{.mark}.]{.underline} Specifying, crucially, [Wynter
targets]{.underline} \"Ethno-Class Man.\" She targets [\"Western
bourgeois Man]{.underline},\" which is barely a \"Western bourgeois
humanism,\" arguably, for it is not a \"humanism\" for or of
\"humanity\" but a species-negating pseudo-humanism for \"Man\" and the
world of the dominant or hegemonic Western bourgeoisie. Wynter would
coin the term \"mono-humanism\" since that nominal \"humanism\" of
\"Man\" seeks to suppress any other discourse of \"human being\" that
could historically contest and/or displace it. She regularly recalls
Clifford Geertz\'s description of the \"local culture\" of the West56 to
refuse European cultural imperialism in general. She particularizes that
\"culture\" and she particularizes its projected \"humanism\" as it
imposes itself globally as well as locally under the falsely
universalizing name of \"Man.\" And, categorically, both the \"indio\"
and the \"negro\" confront humanist subjection here well beyond the
politics of land or land rights in continental Africa and the
hemispheric Americas centuries before Wilderson\'s Anglo-North American
discourse of \"Native Americans\" ever comes into English-language use
in British settler-colonial territories. [As [Wynter excavates
the]{.mark} discursive [foundations of]{.mark} the \"[modern]{.mark}\"
world, [her]{.mark} Black radical [project has been to map]{.mark} out
[new territory of Black and human]{.mark} liberation [from \"Man\"
or]{.mark} his [misappropriation of \"the Human,\" a Black world project
of \"human being\" symptomatically]{.mark} evaded and [occluded
by]{.mark} the \"[Afro-pessimisms\" that render \"Man\" as \"the
Human\"]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[and \"**the white
world**\"]{.underline}]{.mark} [merely [as \'the
world\"]{.mark}]{.underline} itself.

[Reflecting further on these matters]{.underline} in \"PROUD FLESH
Inter/Views: Sylvia [Wynter]{.underline},\" she literally
[begins]{.underline} the exchange by [asking: \"Why does this meaning
have to be put on being Black---this meaning of
non-being?\"]{.underline}57 She continues to discuss
\"psycho-intellectual\" struggles and \"anti-Blackness\" before there
was any such thing as an Afro-pessimism recycled: \"Then you can
understand why in the \'60s it wasn\'t just a call for Black Studies; it
was a call for Black Aesthetics, it was a call for Black Art, it was a
call for Black Power. It was an understanding that, as Lewis Gordon has
been the first to keep insisting, we live in an anti-Black world---a
systematically anti-Black world.\"58 [[When]{.mark} the [terms
\"anti-Black]{.mark}\"]{.underline} or \"anti-Blackness\" [[are
used]{.underline}]{.mark} these days, in academic contexts and on social
media and in \"nonprofit activism,\" [[a false genealogy is
assumed]{.mark} that routes it away from Gordon\'s]{.underline} *Bad
Faith and Antiblack Racism* (1995) or his Fanonist epistemic politics of
Black liberation, [only [to]{.mark} credit and [bolster
pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 302\] with such quasi-literate
revisionism. Broadly, Wynter retraces the work of the Black Arts
Movement, the Black Aesthetic Movement, the [[Black
Power]{.underline}]{.mark} Movement [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Black Studies]{.underline}]{.mark} Movement [along with other Black
anti-colonial movements]{.underline} for Black liberation
[worldwide]{.underline}, [all]{.underline} of which [[generate a]{.mark}
historic [transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} or transvaluation [[of the
meaning of \"Black\" beyond]{.mark} \"black\" as well as
\"[slave]{.mark}\" or \"Slave\" [and mount]{.mark} major if incomplete
[challenges to]{.mark} the [mono-humanism of Western
\"Man\"]{.mark}]{.underline} [masquerading as \"the
Human.\"]{.underline} What\'s more, she zeroes in on the \"Americanism\"
reiterated by Wilderson with her sort of Malcolmite treatment of the
Duboisian \"double-consciousness\" so characteristic of \"Negro\" elites
everywhere: \"He\'s really saying that to be an \'American\' and a
\'Man\' he has to be anti-Negro; and, therefore, he\'s struggling
because he doesn\'t want to give up \[the idea of\] being an
\'American.\' I had of course to put in the concept of \'Man\' which he
doesn\'t use. He says to be an \'American\' and a \'Negro.\' But I want
to argue that to be an \'American\' is perhaps the fullest embodiment of
this conception of the human, \'Man\' (in which we now realize
ourselves).\"59 [Her repressed body of work exposes the \"humanist\"
Americanism and larger Occidental \"humanism\" of this new-old
Afro-pessimism]{.underline} with ease.

#### Preoccupation with the metaphysical implications of the Anthropocene [prevents]{.underline} the development of a new humanism in line with historical revolutionary traditions. 

**Gilroy, 18**---Department of English, King's College London (Paul,
""Where every breeze speaks of courage and liberty": Offshore Humanism
and Marine Xenology, or, Racism and the Problem of Critique at Sea
Level," Antipode, Volume 50, Issue 1, January 2018, 3-22, dml)

Recent [enthusiasm for the Anthropocene]{.underline} has to be
understood symptomatically. It must be appreciated as part of the
contemporary crisis of radical thought and imagination. That chronic
condition connects most obviously and immediately to the demise of
historical materialism and the attendant waning of its view of
historicality. However, it [is]{.underline} also [linked to the pursuit
of **theoretical sophistication for its own sake** in fields from which
the mechanisms of determination and correspondence have been
**banished** along with important lessons pertaining to]{.underline} the
history of overdevelopment and what we might call the post-imperial
ethics of planetarity ([the challenge of **inhabiting a shared
present**]{.underline}).

The current popularity of the Anthropocene also conveys how the looming
catastrophes resulting from industrial and military destruction of our
planet have been apprehended by the fading humanities and how the twin
options described by Wark can exist happily on the same field defined by
its wilful deference to an apparently incorrigible scientific reason.
That naïve reaction has sometimes become part of the institutional
defence of the humanities in universities where they are judged
disposable and marginal, but it is not something in which historically
minded critics of Euro-American racial science have so far been inclined
to indulge. Our view of scientific knowledge as provisional, contextual
and culturally embedded was learned the hard way by reckoning with the
performative power of Blumenbach's personal golgatha.25 It was confirmed
by the long reach of Samuel Morton's manipulated craniometry and the
persistent substitution of the fictitious name Helen Lane for that of an
African-American woman, Henrietta Lacks.

The connections between these apparently divergent examples are not
difficult to establish. [Critical interest in the sovereign racial
orders, hierarchies and ontologies that have assembled the world in
raciological and colonial patterns, connects **directly** with the
central issue of the **human**]{.underline}---the conceptual integrity
of that vexed category and the problems that link orders of domination
among human beings to their various exploitative and extractive
relationships with nature. [That perennially unfashionable and vulgar
connection is **intrinsic** to the possibility of any **new
humanism**---including those that would be licensed, **not by pastiches
of Deleuze** and **Heidegger** battling to end the exceptionalism/
uniqueness of the human species]{.underline},26 [but by a determination
to **destroy the bitter stratification** of that species along the lines
specified by race or]{.underline} as it is now blandly known "[human
biodiversity]{.underline}". How that task can be connected to the
transformation of the exploitation of external nature remains a hotly
contested matter as we shall see.

[I am speaking]{.underline} now [**not** as a representative of
**infrahuman life forms** who are resentful at having been pronounced as
**having a lower value** than others, but as somebody who has been
working to **restore a measure of moral credibility** to anti-racist
critique and to explore the **rehabilitation of**]{.underline} 20th
century [**humanist voices**---particularly those with roots **outside
Europe**---which might precipitate **safer** and **more worthwhile
political possibilities**]{.underline} after the end of natural
evolution. Much of my previous writing was concerned to unearth the
perennially overlooked history and historicity of [peoples **repeatedly
judged closer to nature** so that they might **more readily be
exploited**]{.underline}. [Sometimes]{.underline}, they [were
**excluded** from the category of human **altogether** so that their
lives might be **disposed of with impunity**]{.underline}. That exile
from humanity is crucial and has, at different times, been considered to
be both a disability and a hermeneutic opportunity, even an advantage. I
do not hold a strong version of the "double consciousness" argument that
can be derived from W.E.B. [Du Bois]{.underline}' Hegelianism, but he
[convinced me that there were epistemological and moral insights to be
won from that painful predicament. Today, those opportunities are **not
confined** only to those who underwent immediate traumatic experiences
which involved whole, complex lives being **reduced** to the ambiguous
condition of **infrahuman brutishness**]{.underline}.

More importantly, [the position of being but not belonging, or more
accurately of non-being while being-racialized, **significantly
complicates** all the tidy, binary schemes that oppose nature to history
or culture]{.underline}. At the risk of being boring, let me remind you
that [those **violent**, **exclusionary mechanisms** were and remain, in
some sense, acts of **inclusion**]{.underline}. The characteristic
doubling, which is involved in being simultaneously inside and outside
the polity and its definitions of humanity, reveals not only the
signature motifs of governmental and juridical racism but also what
some, in pursuit of the enhanced theoretical sophistication, now prefer
to describe as the mechanisms of biopolitical governmentality.27

The aporetic predicament of those infrahuman beings is, in part, a
product of the modern, European thought experiments that entangled
emergent anthropological knowledge arising from the terminal points in
European trading activity, with purely theoretical analysis of universal
human progress from nature to society. Those epistemological excursions
would eventually yield both natural history and political anatomy. They
were often conducted under the heading of "the state of nature" and it
is easy to forget that, as Giorgio Agamben repeats in Homo Sacer, "the
state of nature is not a real epoch chronologically prior to the
foundation of the City but a principle internal to the City, which
appears at the moment the City is considered tanquam dissoluta". 28 Here
I want to acknowledge---though I by no means agree with all of his
arguments---the work done recently by Alexander Weheliye.29

I would like you to hold those big problems in the background while you
ask yourself why so many of today's most influential and sophisticated
theoretical perspectives are completely unwilling or unable to focus
upon the cognitive, aesthetic, military, scientific, medical, moral and
economic problems that are still routinely articulated together as
matters of race? Why is that absence so durable and that academically
respectable refusal so resilient? More than that, I would like you to
speculate on how the concept of the Anthropocene might function
differently if the history of racial orders and concepts could be taken
fully into account. In other words, how might we become more
comprehensively estranged from the Anthropos in the Anthropocene in
order to salvage a different, and perhaps re-enchanted human from the
rising waters and transformed climates that characterize the future of
our endangered species?

[I **do not want** our discussion]{.underline} of those questions [to be
**dominated** by the issue of how a **corrective** or **compensatory
reversal** of that infrahuman status might be won, or of the potential
contribution to that reparation which might or might not be made by the
concept of **recognition**. These practical issues **cannot be resolved
in the abstract** and assessing them requires a **long account of black
political culture** and **political ontology**]{.underline} that I do
not have the space to provide here. However, before I set the thorny
problem of institutionalized (mis)recognition aside, I want to suggest
that [the **history of struggles** toward the goal of **admission into
the human** has produced a **distinctive idiom of political reflection**
in which a particular rhetoric of species-life has repeatedly
featured]{.underline}.

[The **salvaging** and **refiguring** of the racialized
human]{.underline}, both before and after the 20th century's noisy death
of Man, [necessitates the adoption of **unorthodox interpretative
angles**. It includes **repeated contrasts** between the significance of
racial divisions and the attraction of an **open category of humanity**
that is **wholly incompatible** with race and raciality though still
prone to being **disfigured** by racism]{.underline}. This faint
possibility might, in the language of Fanon's early writing, seek to
instate a "real dialectic between ... \[the\] body and the world"30 in
the social spaces previously colonized by racial-corporeal schemata.

Whether [those attempts]{.underline} are discovered in the work of
Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth or of Primo Levi and Jean Améry,
they [**nudge us away** from the category of "the political" altogether
and demand a **more extensive ethical sensibility** than it can
accommodate]{.underline}. Usually (though Améry's unqualified enthusiasm
for the state of Israel as a national liberation project is an
exception) [they also involve **dissociating** the pursuit of human
freedom from the **governmental institutionalization of sovereign
power**]{.underline}, particularly via the compensatory establishment of
palingenetic, national states.

In its religious manifestations, [this sort of thinking was
**fundamental** to modern movements for the **abolition of
slaving**]{.underline}, particularly where slavery's undoing was thought
to reside in the development of newly minted, colour-free, national
citizenship in the place of sojourn or elsewhere. Similar aspirations
featured heavily in the anti-racist propaganda that emerged from the
abolitionist movement---think, for example, of the way in which Mr
Wedgewood's suppliant black porcelain figures solicited alternative
conceptions of kinship and friendship that could offset the appeal of
citizenship, coveted yet denied. [These mentalities reappeared again to
guide the **struggle against lynching** in the US as well as to shape
the **battles of indigenous peoples** against colonial power and rule.
All the vulnerable groups involved strove to **reconfigure** the
relationship between humanity and polity and]{.underline}, as I have
argued elsewhere, [there is a **counter-history of human rights**
waiting to be distilled from the ways that concept was set to work by a
host of **long-forgotten feminists**, **abolitionists** and
**suffragists**]{.underline}.31 Today, [the volume of that overlooked
material provides an additional stimulus to **interrogate critically**
the persistent claim that **reckless appeals to universal humanity were
all that was required** in order to incubate and nurture modern
racism]{.underline}. There is still much work to be done to demonstrate
how the rise of formal, bourgeois democracy supplied a midwife for the
birth of properly scientific conceptions of racial hierarchy.32 However,
[a **more detailed** and **extensive causal explanation** is required
than **loudly announcing** that all the blame must be **laid at the door
of humanism**]{.underline}. The last work produced by Edward Said is
very helpful in suggesting a direction for these future inquiries. He
reminds us that in the US at least:

... antihumanism took hold on the ... intellectual scene partly because
of widespread revulsion with the Vietnam War. Part of that revulsion was
the emergence of a resistance movement to racism, imperialism generally,
and the dry-as-dust academic humanities that had for years represented
an unpolitical, unworldly, and oblivious (sometimes even manipulative)
attitude to the present, all the while adamantly extolling the virtues
of the past, the untouchability of the canon, and the superiority of
"how we used to do it"--- superiority, that is, to the disquieting
appearance on the intellectual and academic scene of such things as
women's, ethnic, gay, cultural, and postcolonial studies and, above all
I believe, a loss of interest in and the vitiation of the core idea of
the humanities.33

[In tracing a **more detailed account** of liberal humanism's unfolding
and of the waves of resistance against it, we discover that a **language
of species** emerged to **contest** and **repudiate** the claims built
upon racial discourse. This orientation was **somewhat different** in
character from]{.underline}, on the one hand, the approaches to species
that arose from Marx's early philosophical anthropology and, on the
other, from [the **loftier**]{.underline} species [**discourse** that
has appeared]{.underline} more recently hand in glove [with **enthusiasm
for the Anthropocene**]{.underline}. Neither of those important
contributions has been routed through what we can call the trials of
racial critique. Indeed, neither of them sees any particular virtue or
value in the kind of work I regard as absolutely necessary: a specific,
deliberate and patient overcoming of the claims of raciology and
racialized sovereignty. For the most part, casual chat about the
Anthropocene remains curiously comfortable when the startled rabbit of
universal humanity is produced by the conjuring hands of science from
the top hat of geological time--- a gesture which, to my mind, erases
not just the destructive, restless agency of capitalism as a voracious,
chaotic system but obscures the particular responsibility for this
catastrophe that results from the pathologies of colonialism and
weaponized overdevelopment.34

So far this argument might be summed up in the proposition that the
enduring critique of racial hierarchy and racialized humanity is not the
minor, incidental matter that many sophisticated commentators would like
it to remain. [I am **unsympathetic** to virtual, "hashtag" politics in
general and **do not see the black vulnerability** we associate with the
workings of the US racial nomos **mirrored everywhere else**;
however]{.underline}, the last few years in that country, rather like
recent events in Mare Nostrum, the Mediterranean, suggest that [the
callous and capricious violence resulting from racial orders **should
not be too swiftly passed over**. The frequent killing of African
Americans by the police that has been revealed to the world]{.underline}
by the mediation of the mobile phone-camera [is just one more piece of
evidence which makes the history of anti-racist movements **worth
re-constructing** with the greatest possible care]{.underline}. It bears
repetition that [their energies can not only **illuminate** and
**explain** important, recurring patterns in the history of statecraft,
government, war and sovereign power, they can also **yield resources**
that might **guide current struggles** for peace and dignity, and
against war and injustice]{.underline}.

#### They frame power as [metaphysical]{.underline} and emphasize [defiant assertion]{.underline} of [subaltern difference]{.underline} over [material transformation]{.underline}, which is [mutually exclusive]{.underline} with organization based on the successful history of radical humanist organizing. They [cement]{.underline} power at best and gets [coopted]{.underline} by reactionary forces at worst.

**Spencer, 17**---Senior Lecturer in Postcolonial Literatures and
Cultures at the University of Manchester (Robert, "Postcolonialism is a
Humanism," *For Humanism: Explorations in Theory and Politics*, Chapter
3, pg 142-151, dml)

[So **intensive** and **all-embracing** is]{.underline} discursive
[power]{.underline} in Said's account, so insinuatingly efficient and so
detached from the invidious business of physical coercion, [that it runs
the risk of **ignoring the potential** (and even the **manifest fact**)
of **organised political opposition** to power]{.underline}. Of course,
Foucault famously insists that power invariably engenders its opposite:
'Where there is power, there is resistance and yet this resistance is
never in a position of exteriority in relation to power.'77 [Resistance
takes place]{.underline}, Foucault concedes, [but]{.underline} it does
so **[at power's behest]{.underline}**. This being the case, it hardly
merits the term. For [this kind of resistance is]{.underline} surely [a
**poor substitute** for revolution]{.underline}. If the latter indicates
irreconcilable antagonism then the former denotes a kind of dependent or
symbiotic relationship with power. As Moishe Postone argues, [[the
rhetoric of resistance]{.mark} **often [goes hand in hand]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} an **inability to identify the system supposedly being
resisted** or even really to **countenance** that system's
transformation]{.underline}:

[The notion of resistance]{.underline} \... [**says little** about the
**nature** of that which is being resisted or of the **politics** of the
resistance involved]{.underline} -- that is, the character of
determinate forms of critique, opposition, rebellion, and 'revolution.'
[The notion]{.underline} of resistance frequently [expresses [a]{.mark}
**deeply [dualistic worldview]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} tends to
**[reify]{.mark}** both [the **system of domination**]{.mark} and the
**idea of agency**. It is [**rarely based** on]{.mark} a **reflexive
[analysis]{.mark}** [of possibilities for]{.mark} **fundamental
[change]{.mark}** that are both **generated** and **suppressed** by a
**dynamic heteronomous order**]{.underline}.78

[The idea of resistance **extols agency** but offers **no judgements**
about the **type of agency that should be undertaken** by the
oppressed]{.underline}. Moreover, [it [**says nothing about strategy**
and **goals**. **Nor**]{.mark} does it **[name the system]{.mark}** that
is [being resisted or even **envisage**]{.mark} **openly** that system's
[**deposal** and **replacement**, **restricting itself**]{.mark} instead
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**reactive** and **defensive
manoeuvres**]{.underline}]{.mark} implied by the word in both English
and French. Thus Bill Ashcroft's account of postcolonial resistance
defines it as the 'subtle' and 'unspoken' 'form\[s\] of defence' by
which 'an invader is "kept out"'. [This kind of resistance is **not
organised** or **concerted** or even **conscious**, and is **not
dedicated** to]{.underline} anything as dogmatic as [**prevailing over**
or even **opposing** the thing it resists. 'Can one even resist without
obviously "opposing"? The answer]{.underline} to this [is obviously
"yes!"]{.underline}'79 [That sort of answer is [**inseparable** from a
perception of **helplessness**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Postone has
argued; [[it connotes **survival** and **defiance** but]{.mark} **not
transformation**]{.underline}. Indeed, [Postone attributes]{.underline}
what he calls ['the **current impasse** of the Left']{.underline}80
[to]{.underline} the abandonment of an older anticapitalist idiom and
[the advent of a **far less rigorous** worldview that **fails to
identify** the target of resistance and that [**fails to
interrogate**]{.mark} the often [**reactionary politics** and]{.mark}
frequently [**terroristic strategies**]{.mark} of many self-styled
'resistance' movements]{.underline}. Indeed, [[by **blurring
distinctions** between]{.mark} **very [different forms]{.mark}** of
political action, the [**undiscriminating acclamation of resistance**
leads to]{.mark} some **crass political
[misjudgements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} postcolonialists
[are **not**, **surely**, in favour of **all reactions** to dominant
forms of power, but only of those responses that **possess the moral**
and **political resources necessary** to supplant those
forms]{.underline}. Postone reminds us that **[[militant
Islamism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, [[may be]{.mark} a form of
[resistance but]{.mark} it [is **hardly revolutionary**]{.mark}. It has
**less to do** with any **genuine confrontation with dictatorship** and
with]{.underline} the precipitate **[economic decline]{.underline}** in
many predominantly Muslim countries [than with **anti-Semitism**,
**misogyny** and a **totalitarian vision** of a 'purified'
society]{.underline}, none of which were top of the Left's traditional
wish list. What Postone does not add, perhaps because he does not trace
the popularity of the notion of resistance to the esteem in which
Foucault's work is still held, is that **[Foucault]{.underline}**
himself [made the **very same misjudgement**]{.underline}, as Kevin
Anderson discusses in this collection, [when his articles]{.underline}
in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera [trumpeted the Islamic
forces that **hijacked the Iranian revolution**]{.underline}.81

In the end, [[the notion]{.mark} of resistance **[does nothing but
cement]{.mark} in place [the system it purports to
oppose]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which ironically is what Foucault
believes to be the fate of the idea and practice of humanism: 'The man
described for us, whom we are invited to free, is already in himself the
effect of a subjection much more profound than himself.'82 In Foucault's
view, subjectivity is both the effect of power and the means by which
power is articulated and enforced. To be a subject is already to be
subjected, and therefore to inscribe humanist slogans on one's banners
is unwittingly to confirm and endorse that subjection. Indeed, in a
celebrated and lyrical passage, [Foucault bids farewell]{.underline} not
just to the idea of a unified and all-determining human subject (which
the mostly Marxist thinkers against whom Foucault defined his own
thinking had already rejected) but [to **human subjectivity
itself**]{.underline}:

If the \[arrangements of knowledge since the sixteenth century\] were to
disappear as they appeared, if some event of which we can at the moment
do no more than sense the possibility -- without knowing either what its
form will be or what it promises -- were to cause them to crumble, as
the ground of Classical thought did, at the end of the eighteenth
century, then one can certainly wager that man would be erased, like a
face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea.83

[This [**aversion** to]{.mark} the prospect of [a **transformed** and
**emancipated subjectivity**]{.mark} has a **deleterious
effect**]{.underline} on Foucault's work. Foucault leaves himself
[**bereft of any vision** of subjective freedom to **set against the
subject's domination** by power]{.underline}. As Peter Dews has argued
in relation to Foucault, '[a theory of power with radical intent
**requires an account** of that which power **dominates** or
**represses**, since **without such an account** relations of power must
**cease to appear objectionable**]{.underline}'.84 Candidates for this
role in Foucault's work include, in Madness and Civilization, the
expression of impulse and spontaneity, popular justice in the
ultra-gauchiste Discipline and Punish of 1975 and the body and its
pleasures in the later History of Sexuality. 'What is Enlightenment?',
one of Foucault's last texts, even calls for a more nuanced approach to
humanism and the Enlightenment, this last perhaps, Janet Afary and Kevin
Anderson speculate,85 as a result of having his fingers burnt by the
tragic outcome of the revolution in Iran and the furore surrounding his
support for its Islamist turn.

It is perhaps his awareness of [these **shortcomings**]{.underline} in
Foucault's work that led Said, in several texts written after
Orientalism, to offer a lengthy appraisal of what he saw as the
limitations of Foucault's characterisation of power. 'Criticism Between
Culture and System' concedes that Foucault had done very constructive
work in exposing the interestedness and violence frequently hidden
beneath the discourses of rationality and scientific objectivity. Yet
Foucault [had neither **illuminated the sources of power** nor **laid
enough emphasis**]{.underline} in his work [on power's **limitations**
and **weak points**]{.underline}. Indeed, Foucault had actually obscured
power's origins in ruling classes and dominant interests. His [work
[portrayed power]{.mark}]{.underline} instead, [**misleadingly**, [as 'a
**spider's web without the spider**]{.mark}']{.underline}86
[and]{.underline}, Said might have added, [**without any flies** either.
[**Why power is exercised** and **by whom** are]{.mark} questions
**[rarely]{.mark} if ever [broached]{.mark}**]{.underline} by Foucault.
Moreover, [**contests between classes**, **societies** and
**ideologies** are **largely absent**]{.underline} from Foucault's work,
which 'takes a curiously passive and sterile view not so much of the
uses of power, but of how and why power is gained, used, and held
onto'.87

In understandably wishing to avoid the crude notion that power is
unmediated domination, Foucault more or less eliminates the central
dialectic of opposed forces that still underlies modern society, despite
the apparently perfected methods of 'technocratic' control and seemingly
nonideological efficiency that seem to govern everything. [What [one
**misses**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Foucault [is]{.underline} something
resembling Gramsci's [**[analyses]{.mark} of hegemony**, **historical
blocks**, **ensembles of relationship** done [from]{.mark} the
perspective of [an **engaged political worker** for]{.mark} whom the
**fascinated [description]{.mark} of exercised power** [is **never a
substitute** for]{.mark} trying to **[change]{.mark} power
relationships** within society]{.underline}.88

Said soon recognised that Foucault's [[portrayal of power as
**inexorable**]{.underline}]{.mark} had induced him to [[**ignore the
possibility** and **desirability**]{.mark} -- quite [apart from
the]{.mark} **manifest [actuality]{.mark}** -- [of]{.mark} **[political
struggle]{.mark}** against the **effects** of]{.underline} discursive
[power and against the **social** and **economic order** on
which]{.underline} discursive [power rests]{.underline}.

[No matter **how it may be made to appear** in texts or **how it looks
from privileged cultural perspectives**, [power]{.mark} **rarely
manifests itself** in history in ways that are **unproblematic** and
**unopposed**, let alone **non-corporeal**: 'history']{.underline}, Said
reminds us, ['[is **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[homogeneous]{.underline}]{.mark}** French-speaking territory [[but a
**complex interaction**]{.mark} between uneven economies, societies, and
ideologies']{.underline}.89 [[To **pretend otherwise** is to
characterise power as **ineluctable**]{.mark} and, **just as
unhelpfully**, to portray power as a **kind of performance** addressed
not to the **body** but]{.underline}, as Foucault puts it, [to the
**soul**]{.underline}. Yet [to speak of power becoming a **discourse**
is]{.underline}, to borrow a phrase from Susan Sontag, [a **breathtaking
provincialism**]{.underline}.90 Foucault's scholarly work, which is
barely far-reaching enough to be called Eurocentric, never addresses
situations in which direct physical violence (as opposed to disembodied
techniques of control) is still the principal means by which power is
inflicted, most of which are outside the region with which his work is
immediately concerned and many of which have been controlled
historically by the nations whose histories interest him above all
others. This soft-pedalling of power's inseparability from violence is
especially problematic when it comes to giving an account of how power
operates in the colonial and postcolonial worlds. The reason for Said's
more or less total renunciation of Foucault's work and therefore also
the reason why I think postcolonial scholarship should likewise ditch
Foucault's characteristic emphases and look instead to other, more
enabling antecedents, is that [[we **cannot come close** to]{.mark} an
[**accurate theorisation** of]{.mark} colonial [power **without
acknowledging its**]{.mark}]{.underline} inseparability from violence
and its fallibility as well as its resulting [**[vulnerability]{.mark}
to moral critique** and **political transformation**]{.underline}.
Foucault's work's most grievous flaws, for Said, are its inadvertent
parochialism and its tendency to depict power as all-penetrating and
inexorable. Resulting from this was Foucault's inability to even
countenance revolutionary historical change.91 The point is that [[the
**critic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, if he or she is [to **merit that
title**]{.underline}, [[has an **obligation** not just to **describe
power** but]{.mark} also [to **explain its existence**]{.mark}, **trace
its origins**, **criticise its effects** [and **beseech its
dissolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I have gone to some trouble to demonstrate and explain the reasons for
Said's renunciation of the antihumanist dimensions of Foucault's work.
This was so I can now go on to show in precise terms how and why Said
subsequently sought to present the processes of colonial power and of
revolutionary opposition to colonial power from an unmistakably, indeed
avowedly, humanist perspective. It is worth pausing to note, however,
that the discipline his early work inspired has not followed him down
that path. 'Power' for Foucault is ubiquitous and perdurable; it is
attended by 'resistance', which is similarly everywhere and everlasting.
Foucault makes no moral judgements about power or about resistance.
Content with describing this pas de deux, his philosophy contains no
perspective on liberation. [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} Said's
[[work]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, precisely because that work is
[[**inspired by humanist convictions**, 'power' is]{.mark}
**characterised**]{.underline} quite [**differently**, as a
**[historical]{.mark}** ([**rather** than]{.mark} a
**[metaphysical]{.mark}**) **phenomenon**, as a system to which a **name
can be given**, that can be **subjected to critique** [and]{.mark} that
[has been **placed on borrowed time** by]{.mark} political [projects
that aim **not just to resist** but]{.mark} **actively [to
transform]{.mark}** and **replace power**.]{.underline}

Nobody needs me to tell them that Orientalism's influence in
postcolonial studies, a discipline it effectively founded and whose
characteristic methodological and political emphases it therefore helped
to shape, has been immense. Yet that book decidedly exaggerates the
durability, scope and intensity of the colonial discourse it maps out,
it obscures colonialism's origin and purpose, and it postpones until
later work any attention to those anticolonial projects whose
aspirations were so far-reaching and, at least in their early years, so
staggeringly successful that it would be simply churlish to dismiss them
as mere acts of 'resistance'. 'Colonial discourse', a concept whose
adoption is in many ways postcolonial theory's original sin, has been
portrayed as an expansive, subjectless and ineluctable phenomenon
insinuated through discreet rituals and performances. Even when texts
are declared to 'hybridise' colonial discourse, or else subject it to
the rejoinders of 'difference', there is rarely any sense that colonial
discourse might fundamentally be undermined, let alone overthrown -- the
Sisyphean labour of 'subverting' colonial discourse being what keeps us
in work. Postcolonial critics have commonly been suspicious of
categories like class. Little wonder, because capitalism is not a word
frequently heard from their lips. Indeed, the discipline has been prone
to muffle ongoing forms of imperial domination with the comforting
rhetoric of globalisation and hybridity. Postcolonialists are indignant
about 'Eurocentrism' (which is an idea) but rarely exercised by ongoing
forms of imperialism (which is also a particularly brutal practice), in
addition to being curiously silent about capitalism (which has been as
willing as ever to bare its teeth since the 1970s and without reference
to which the phenomenon of imperialism becomes literally
incomprehensible). As far back as Aijaz Ahmad's In Theory (1992),
postcolonial theory's left wing has arraigned the discipline for its
most prominent critics' frankly idealist belief that it was not
capitalist imperialism that structured and explained the world but more
cultural or 'discursive' constructions like Eurocentrism, racism or
nationalism:

An obvious consequence of repudiating Marxism was that one now sought to
make sense of the world of colonies and empires much less in terms of
classes, much more in terms of nations and countries and races, and
thought of imperialism itself not as a hierarchically structured system
of global capitalism but as a relation, of governance and occupation,
between richer and poorer countries, West and non-West. And whether one
said so or not, one inevitably believed that ideas -- 'culture' was the
collective term in most mystifications, or 'discourse', but it mainly
meant books and films -- and not the material conditions of life which
include the instance of culture itself, determine the fate of people and
nations.92

[**Eurocentrism**, **[racism]{.mark}** and **nationalism**, along with
**patriarchy**]{.underline} for that matter, precisely [because they
were [seen as]{.mark} **mostly [cultural]{.mark} phenomena**, could be
opposed by **defending difference** or **invoking hybridity**,
**laudable endeavours**]{.underline} of course [but also
**[incomplete]{.mark}**]{.underline} or at least insufficient. [The
**consequences** of]{.underline} what Arif Dirlik has called [this
'**shift in attention** to questions of cultural identity]{.underline}
in postcolonial discourse'93 [are]{.underline} at once theoretical and
practical; [**theoretical** because the **phenomenon of capitalist
imperialism**]{.underline} thereby [**escapes our conceptual nets**,
**practical** because **[energies are]{.mark} then [devoted]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} '**hybridising**' the West or **[defending
difference]{.mark}** from it, undertakings [for
which]{.mark}]{.underline} the category of capitalism, let alone the
**[[practice]{.underline}]{.mark}** of anticapitalism, [[is]{.mark}
**simply [nugatory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is the 'postcolonial
unconscious' as Lazarus defines it. Postcolonial [[theorists look
for]{.mark} 'resistance' in '**mimicry**', '[**migrancy**']{.mark},
'**hybridity**', '**ambivalence**', '[**subalternity**']{.mark},
'[**liminality**']{.mark} or the '**multitude**', all of
which]{.underline} are terms that [**have in common** [an assumption
that struggle takes place **not against the
system**]{.mark}]{.underline} of capitalist imperialism (though it is
rarely called that) [[but **within**]{.underline}]{.mark} that system
and even at its behest.

Happily, Said's later work set about qualifying and even repudiating
many of the key claims made in what would prove to be a quite anomalous
early book in the context of a sizeable oeuvre that remained militantly
humanist in both its methodology and its political convictions. Insofar
as it has hitched its wagon to post-structuralist philosophies like that
of Foucault, postcolonial theory has, by contrast, been dragged too far
from the political and intellectual commitments of its founding thinker
and, in what amounts to the same thing, from the original convictions
and aspirations of anticolonialism. Orientalism's readers were led
astray by the unnecessary and incongruous references to Foucault, who if
Lazarus is to be believed was perhaps name-checked in that book for
tactical reasons in order to ease the book's reception by 'leftist'
scholars for whom Foucault was de rigueur at the time of Orientalism's
publication. Said's humanism, however, presents the 'discourse' of
Orientalism very differently. The whole of the rest of [Said's
work]{.underline}, from his early work on the philosophy of 'beginnings'
[through]{.underline} his **[advocacy of]{.underline}** the [**rights**
and **aspirations**]{.underline} of his Palestinian compatriots to his
later writings on music and aesthetic style, [is premised on an
**unmistakably**]{.underline} and avowedly, not to mention gleefully and
sometimes provocatively unrepentant, [**humanist stress** on the
**[limits to]{.mark}**]{.underline} discursive
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Said was no Marxist of course, or at
least he professed himself, understandably enough, extremely ambivalent
about Marxism's political record.94 But Said's desire to attend not just
to the cobweb but to the spider, to the fly and to the web's frailty
certainly makes his work in my view compatible with Marxism. His later
work is adamant in particular that [the limits]{.underline} to
discursive power [[are **set**]{.mark} and **exemplified** [by]{.mark}
the ideas of **[human solidarity]{.mark}** and **human freedom** which
were **[articulated]{.mark} most powerfully** [by]{.mark} the **first
generation of [anticolonial movements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whose
achievements Said celebrated, whose defeat he mourned and [whose
**transformative aspirations** he **longed to reignite**]{.underline}.

Said, in short, traced his own approach not to Foucault, whose name
continued to be ubiquitous in postcolonial scholars' work long after he
had ceased dropping it, but to the premises and principles of humanist
intellectual practice articulated by half-forgotten American literary
critics like R. P. Blackmur, Richard Poirier and Lionel Trilling, and
especially by German comparative philologists like Erich Auerbach and
Leo Spitzer.95 In one of his last books, Humanism and Democratic
Criticism, Said outlines what he sees as the two chief precepts of
humanist practice. The first is the deceptively straightforward
proposition that [that which has been **humanly made**]{.underline} (and
which is subject neither to the laws unearthed by the natural sciences
nor to the unchanging verities pondered by metaphysicians) [is
**uniquely susceptible to analysis** and **change**. Societies, dogmas,
texts and the very mores and ideas of the self are **variable [products
of human work]{.mark}**. Because they were **conceived** and **made**
they [can be **reconceived** and **remade**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Knowledge, however, is not uncontroversial or easily gained. Glossing
Vico, Said remarks upon the mind's fallibility, its passionate rather
than dispassionate nature and its unavoidable entanglement with
interests and situations. [Knowledge of **what is humanly constructed**
is **always incomplete** and **provisional**, a thing to be
**negotiated**, **interrogated** and **improved**]{.underline}. Hence
[humanism entails a **taste for self-renewal** and a **restless
impatience** with the **mind's dogmas**: '**humanism is
critique**']{.underline}.96 Indeed, this is the special vocation of the
humanities in general, which provoke critical scrutiny of humanly
produced institutions and ideas. [[What makes humans]{.mark}
human]{.underline}, in other words, [[is]{.mark} their **distinctive
[capacity for critical self-knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline} or, in the
philologist Leo Spitzer's memorable phrase, 'the power bestowed on the
human mind of investigating the human mind'.97 The distinctive (though
not necessarily superior) human capacity, the thing that allows us in
Sartre's words 'to establish the human kingdom as a pattern of values in
distinction from the material world',98 is consciousness or, if you
like, the consciousness of consciousness. Self-criticism, then, is the
first precept of Said's humanism. The second is the kind of
**[cosmopolitan moral intelligence]{.underline}** that [can result from
self-criticism. **[Humanists' interrogation of]{.mark} partial** and
[**limited perspectives**]{.mark} can [engender]{.mark} a **newly
ecumenical [respect]{.mark}** [for **humanity**]{.mark} **in its
entirety**. If self-criticism is one of the twin poles of [humanistic
endeavour]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore, then [the second is the
potential of self-criticism to **[broaden]{.mark} one's
[sympathies]{.mark}** [as well as]{.mark} one's **[sense of]{.mark}
[moral]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} finally **[political
obligation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Said is a defender of humanism in the
sense of what the humanities do (which is to examine humanly made
phenomena like texts, ideas and institutions) as well as humanism in the
sense of human rights (that is, the belief in the dignity, equality and
value of all human life contained in Seneca's great dictum: 'nothing
human is alien to me').

Having established the twin principles of humanistic endeavour, Humanism
and Democratic Criticism goes on to elucidate the special attributes
required of the American humanist in the wake of 9/11 and the United
States' belligerent response. For a start, democratic [humanism
**contrasts** with]{.underline} the provincial version of this creed
espoused by the [enthusiasts for '**humanitarian intervention**'.
**Nor** does it have **anything to do** with any **unselfconscious
defence of one's own culture** against interlopers]{.underline}, not
just because America -- as Said is at pains to stress -- is a society
made up of immigrants and therefore in conception if not always in fact
a multifarious and hospitable place, but more importantly [because it is
of the **very nature of humanistic activity** to **upset**,
**interrogate** and **reformulate ostensible certainties**. They
**cannot long survive the knowledge of self** and **world** to which
**humanistic scrutiny gives rise**]{.underline}. Critical consciousness
or, put differently, a biting distrust of received wisdom is the
humanist's customary mode. [A form of **incessant questioning**,
humanism **necessitates a militant critique of jingoistic ideologies**
and a **practical refusal to tolerate distant suffering**]{.underline}:

Principally it means situating critique at the heart of humanism,
critique as a form of democratic freedom and as a continuous practice of
questioning and of accumulating knowledge that is open to, rather than
in denial of, the constituent historical realities of the post-Cold War
world, its early colonial formation, and the frighteningly global reach
of the last remaining superpower of today.99

[Without criticism]{.underline}, as W. J. T. Mitchell has argued,
glossing Said, [humanism tends to be]{.underline} a [**sterile** and
**complacent**]{.underline} reverence for the cultural superiority of
the West; **[without humanism]{.underline}**, however, [criticism is
**nothing but empty quibbling**]{.underline}.100

#### Prioritizing inhuman agency [eviscerates]{.underline} their political potential 

**Joronen and Häkli, 16**---Space and Political Agency Research Group,
School of Management, University of Tampere (Mikko and Jouni,
"Politicizing ontology," Prog Hum Geogr June 10, 2016, dml)

The ways in which an [onto-theological [lock-in]{.mark}]{.underline}
easily [[turns into]{.mark} **'theoretical [path dependency']{.mark}**,
**directing** and **circumscribing** how the political is taken
up]{.underline} is further illustrated by Lorimer's (2012) elaborate
discussion on the consequences of vitalist ontologies for the science
and practice of biodiversity conservation. He carefully elucidates
several problems that might benefit from rethinking in a vitalist vein
and shows that the approach resonates strongly with a number of concrete
issues. However, as Lorimer (2012) notes himself many of these are
confined to topics that are "well known and much debated among
conservationists" (Lorimer, 2012: 600). Again, we argue that [vitalist
ontologies would gain **much more political resonance** from giving
consideration to settings in which]{.underline} biodiversity
[conservation meets forces and processes unfolding in **actually
existing** compositions, events and political
rationalities]{.underline}. This is because [the practices]{.underline}
of biodiversity conservation seldom operate autonomously, but rather
they [are **deeply enmeshed** with **fierce political disputes** related
to]{.underline}, for example, [the]{.underline} excessive [use of
natural resources]{.underline} by multinational corporations (e.g.
Zingerli, 2005) [or political steering processes]{.underline} (e.g.
Humalisto & Joronen, 2013).

There is more at stake in theoretical path dependency than just a
pre-defined and often narrow conception of what counts as politics. [The
tendency]{.underline} of onto-theologically oriented approaches [to
operate within their 'comfort zones' leaves many pressing]{.underline}
(human and social) [problems **unattended** [and]{.mark} thus
**seriously [thwarts]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **societal
[relevance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **potential [impact]{.mark}** of the
work itself]{.underline} -- a problem that McNay (2014: 205-206) calls
"social weightlessness" of political thought. [We consider this a **high
price to pay** for ontological novelty operating]{.underline}, as
Castree (2006: 169) writes, "[at **several moves** from
**real-world**]{.underline} scientific enterprise and its wider social
and environmental **[consequences]{.underline}**".

Politics without the (human) subject

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} second encounter between onto-theological
[[reasoning]{.underline}]{.mark} and the political [[**troubles the very
idea of politics** as it introduces non-human entities as political
agents on a par with humans]{.underline}]{.mark} and by distributing the
subject of political agency into contingently emerging assemblages.
[This move is seen [as a]{.mark} **necessary [corrective]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} human [exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline} embedded in
"modernity's ontological homage to a Cartesian dualism" that separates
humans from non-human nature and views the former as superior in
comparison to other entities (Coole, 2005: 125; see also Braun, 2008;
Lorimer, 2012). In introducing a turn away from an anthropocentric
conception of political agency that presupposes "the priority of human
intentions" (Bennett, 2005: 455-456), the building of a posthumanist
ontology carries emancipatory potential by underlining the
interdependency between human and non-human worlds. In addition, it
shows the position of humans as merely one among many politically
consequential events, objects and phenomena, most of which are non-human
or are at least more-than-human (Whatmore, 2002; Hinchliffe, 2008; Braun
and Whatmore, 2010; Latta, 2014).

It is this potential that has received positive responses even from
those who otherwise remain skeptical about the possibility of expanding
the political to include non-humans in something like "cosmopolitics"
unfolding in a "parliament of things" (Latour, 1993; Stengers, 1997).
While Braun (2011: 392), for instance, critically questions the
extensive political charge that vitalist ontologies give to non-humans
like "hurricanes, viruses and electrical grids", he nevertheless notes
that vitalism "may offer a valuable ethical and practical orientation to
the world" with environmental problems of catastrophic proportions
(Braun, 2008: 677). In a similar vein Abrahamsson et al. (2015: 16) note
that "the general claim that 'things have politics' has become too
vague", yet they admit that "political theory should concern itself with
the material world \[...\] in times of pollution, species extinction,
global warming and so on" (Abrahamsson et al., 2015: 5). Arguably, it is
in rethinking human-nature relationships and the illusion of
technological mastery over the non-human world where new ontologies,
usually under the title 'posthuman', operate on the least contentious
terrain. **[Few scholars]{.underline}**, including us, [deny the
**urgency** of complex environmental problems and the need to critically
question modes of thinking that have led to their escalation globally.
**Nonetheless**, [when]{.mark} the notion of [non-human agency forms a
**steady**]{.mark} **onto-theological [stance]{.mark}**[, it risks
projecting a **totalising account of the political**. **Everything
non-human** is thought of as **having political potential**]{.mark}
because everything can have an effect on something]{.underline}
(Bennett, 2005; Roberts, 2012; Shaw and Meehan, 2013; Dittmer, 2014). At
least two problems follow from this. The first has to do with the idea
of responsibility as an aspect of political agency. Viewing political
agency as always-conjoined action across human and non-human entities
underlines that human agency is not, and has never been, anything more
than relative, partial and dependent on the co-action of non-humans.
Thus, [human agency is not only seen as]{.underline} much
**[less]{.underline}** intentional and [**capable** of producing
change]{.underline} than we are accustomed to thinking, but [it is also
**always only partially** in charge of the effects that agency brings
about]{.underline} (Coole, 2013). [Whereas some]{.underline} scholars
[have viewed the distribution of responsibility as carrying an
emancipatory potential in that it allows humanity to **withdraw from the
illusion of mastery** over non-human world]{.underline} (e.g. Lorimer,
2012; Whatmore, 2013), [others have expressed worries about the
consequences]{.underline} of the idea of distributed responsibility
among non-hierarchically organised entities [for our **possibility of
thinking meaningfully** about **politics** and **power
relations**]{.underline}. For example, Krause (2011: 300) warns about
difficulties in sustaining any "attributions of personal responsibility"
that she considers key in democratic citizenship. In a similar vein,
Chandler (2013: 525) notes that [in [distributing agency]{.mark} across
assemblages new materialist ontologies [**deprive us** of the
possibility to "**constitute our own ends**" and]{.mark} thus [leave us
with]{.mark} "merely a world of]{.underline} ~~blind~~
[**\[[unthinking\] necessity]{.mark}**".]{.underline} Schmidt (2013:
184) goes as far as to state that [this leads new materialist ontologies
to leave us merely with the possibility of adaptation, thus "making it
**impossible** for humans to **impose meaning** and **structure** onto
this contingency]{.underline}" (Schmidt, 2013: 191; see also Braun,
2014; Cudworth and Hobden, 2015). To wit, we are not suggesting that the
moves beyond human-centric thought are unfounded. The point for us is
rather that [the]{.underline} onto-theological [excl[usion of
human-centrism **precludes from 'the political'** issues that **in
themselves** are]{.mark} (or happen as) [**human-centred**.
This]{.mark}]{.underline}, we argue, [not only **[dismisses urgent
matters]{.mark}** that are (or may become) politicised but also
paradoxically does its own politics on the level of an **ontological
lock-in**.]{.underline}

The second problem has to do with the notion of the political itself.
[[If all the effects that an]{.mark} entity or [object has]{.mark} upon
another [have a]{.mark} certain '[politics']{.mark}]{.underline} -- as
many arguing for distributed agency would have it -- then [[it becomes
**difficult** to maintain which]{.mark} human or non-human acts, events
or processes [are **not political**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a given
situation. This has the consequence, as Latour (2007) himself puts it,
that ["\[s\]ince by now 'everything is political', the adjective
'political' suffers the same fate as the adjective 'social': In being
extending everywhere, they have both become
**meaningless**]{.underline}" (Latour, 2007: 812). [There is an
important difference to be made between the idea that 'anything can be
politicised' and 'everything is political']{.underline} (Dean, 2000;
Kallio and Häkli, 2011, 2015). While the former rests on the idea of not
fixing the political in advance, [[the latter **dissolves the idea of
politics** by equating it with **any** and **all
change**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consider the ways in which scholars have
recently redressed the idea of politics. For Roberts (2012: 2514),
politics begins "with the material participation of nonhuman forces in
the world's becoming other", while for Latta (2014: 329) "eventful
transgressions or insurgencies of marginalized thing-ness \[... mark\]
moments of political becoming". The political is also revealed "as a
space of questioning to include situations that 'force thought' or
affect" (Donaldson et al., 2013: 605) and is refigured "as an eventful
technogenesis" where "politics amplifies the matters that come to matter
politically" (Whatmore, 2013: 47). As inspiring as [these
formulations]{.underline} may be, they do [**skirt the issue of
politicisation** in favour of [assuming that change is **political in
itself**.]{.mark} Their reliance on]{.underline} the 'onto-theology of
[flow']{.underline}, we argue, [[not only risks **rendering the idea of
the political meaningless** but also **thwarts their capacity** to
resonate with **broader political realities**]{.underline}]{.mark} (see
also Cresswell, 2006; McNay, 2014). In their "desire to transcend the
present and leave it far behind", as Castree points out (2006: 169),
[[such approaches]{.mark} easily [end up **too self-contained** to be
applicable to **actually existing issues**]{.mark} or **events**, [which
are]{.mark} simply [**indifferent** to]{.mark}]{.underline} researchers
"[[desires]{.underline}]{.mark}" and onto-theological views. At worst,
[the "political celebration of the always-already becoming
virtual]{.underline}" (Joronen, 2013: 628) [may turn into an
ontologically grounded political agenda that forms in **complete
isolation from this-worldly concerns**]{.underline}.

The ontological turn as a political pedagogy

What is arguably the most concrete, even if often implicit, encounter
between the ontological turn and the political is the manner in which
the turn in itself proposes and demands specific political processes and
actions to unfold so as to become influential in mobilising change.
Coole (2013: 452), among those who explicitly recognise the political
momentum of vitalist ontology, envisions no less than a
"politicalethical intervention within the material unfolding of the 21st
century", which will be animated by "a transformation of conduct towards
matter" (Coole, 2013: 461). This facet of the ontological turn contains
a promise for political change that involves a fundamental turning away
from "the philosophical legacy of the Enlightenment" and more precisely
from "a humanism that finds ever new ways of positing the nonhuman 'out
there' rather than 'in here'" (Whatmore, 2013: 34, 47). Put differently,
what is needed is a move beyond "an unapologetically anthropocentric"
conception of politics and citizenship that is "engendered within a
political space occupied exclusively by human subjects" (Latta, 2014:
324).

[This]{.underline} is a more radical [form of politics]{.underline} than
at first [may seem]{.underline} as [it requires a profound change in how
humans]{.underline} in the global North, South, East and West [conceive
of being]{.underline} in a way that does not consider agency as "human
or as synonymous with (self-)consciousness, cognition or rationality"
and that does not "privilege some kinds of entity or agency over
others". Instead, it conceives of change in terms of assemblages and
hybrids that are "constantly emerging and dissipating across a
normatively and ontologically horizontal plane" (Coole, 2013: 453-454).
This understanding would free us from ideas of exclusive human agency
that constitutes "the rest of the world as if it were a set of mere
objects" (Connolly, 2011: 31). Instead it shows our place as
co-habitants in a thoroughly interdependent, emergent and
socio-materially assembled world where humans may learn to "minimize
forms of oppression with the other forms of life on the planet"
(Cudworth and Hobden, 2015: 146).

Yet, with all of their emancipatory promise, [these political projects
seem to employ a basic ontotheological argumentation]{.underline}. This
is evident in Connolly's (2011) discussion on the rewards of embracing a
vitalist conception of reality as 'becoming', where he portrays the
political transformation as a "work to 'become who you are,' so that the
word 'become' now modifies 'are' more than the other way around"
(Connolly, 2011: 114). [It is precisely the onto-theological requisite
for [a new notion of the human being]{.mark} that [**creates a lock-in**
whereby the politics it proposes is not achievable without
**extensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} and deep-going pedagogic
**[[transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to Connolly, "the
formation of new maxims, judgments, concepts, and strategies" depends on
the cultivation of the human capacity to "dwell in the world as a seer"
and to amplify "the feeling of attachment to the most fundamental
character of existence as such, as you yourself confess those terms in a
theistic or nontheistic vein" (Connolly, 2011: 165). Hence, humans
everywhere may become who they are but only by apprehending reality as
it really is -- what Schmidt (2013: 181) calls "bare reality". Expanded
on the level of all humanity, [[this would entail an **enormous
political development**]{.mark} comparable to, and even
**[exceeding]{.mark}** in magnitude and importance, [the **rise of
socialist thought**]{.mark} as a global force]{.underline} during the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

[Even if we accept that the politics]{.underline} of vitalist
onto-theology [is a **legitimate utopian vision**]{.underline} -- a view
that some non-Westerners may disagree with -- [[the conditions for its
realisation appear]{.mark} to be
**[controversial]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Chandler (2013: 525) notes,
[when the world is seen in terms of becoming, and [when the subject
lacks coherence due to "forever negotiating]{.mark}]{.underline},
experimenting and reflecting upon [its imbrication
[within]{.mark}]{.underline} complex, fluid and overlapping
[[networks]{.underline}]{.mark} and assemblages", [[there is **little
room** for politics that **sets its own ends**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Yet, a growing vitalist literature seems to suggest that a profound work
on the self is "the only route to changing the world" (Chandler, 2013:
532). Connolly (2011: 26) sets this political project as one of acting
"to cultivate new sensitivities to human and nonhuman agents of multiple
sorts" by commending "work upon the self and the culture to which you
belong". Bennett (2010: 122) echoes this sentiment in stating that to
discharge "fantasies of human mastery" we need to "reshape the self and
its interests". Coole (2013: 461), too, argues for the "importance of
cultivating agency" and notes that to succeed the political project
ultimately depends on humans who are to be held accountable for damage
to vulnerable ecosystems and "must be accorded some privileged role" in
tackling these problems.

Hence, [[while the political promise]{.underline}]{.mark} of these
onto-theologies [[tends to be sketched on an **abstract level** in terms
of]{.mark} "bio-/eco-centric environmentalism]{.underline}" (Coole,
2013: 461) [or "[building alliances with \[...\] nonhuman
nature]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Latta, 2014: 336), [[the **more practical
advice**]{.underline}]{.mark} its protagonists offer [[is]{.mark} to a
great extent]{.underline}, if not a little paradoxically, [[**reliant on
human subjects'** sensibilities]{.mark}, learning and work on the
self]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} perhaps [due to this]{.underline}
posthumanist [paradox that]{.underline} also [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
dimension of antagonism and/or the [[understanding of power
structures]{.underline}]{.mark} (of which the notion of
'self-government' is surely a sign of) [[are **strikingly
missing**]{.mark} from the political repertoire of vitalist
thought]{.underline} (McNay, 2014). [In a subject-less world of
becoming]{.underline}, object relations and emergent causality, [with
the political resting largely on the hope of a more cultivated humanity
living in harmony with the non-human world, the idea of **clashing
interests**, **intentions** or **powers** seems to have **little role to
play**]{.underline} (cf. Beisel, 2010).

#### This is offense---their ethical openness actively sanctifies violence

**Emden, 17**---Professor of German Intellectual History and Political
Thought at Rice University (Christian, "Normativity Matters:
Philosophical Naturalism and Political Theory," *The New Politics of
Materialism: History, Philosophy, Science*, Chapter 12, google books, no
page numbers, dml)

[Braidotti's account highlights the **political pitfalls** of a
posthumanist ethics that **pays little heed** to the problem of
**normativity** and **even less attention** to questions of
**justiﬁcation**. [The ethical stance adopted by]{.mark} a **broad
range** of [posthumanist interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}---from new
materialism to the farthest reaches of speculative realism, or
object-oriented ontology---[[is either **unsurprising** or **banal**:
human exceptionalism is **overrated**, **indeed**]{.mark}, and the
arbitrary exploitation of both human and nonhuman animals is
**questionable on several fronts**]{.underline}.22 [**[Few will
disagree]{.mark}** with such claims, [but relegating the question of
normativity **into the background**]{.mark} also [leads to a]{.mark}
conception of ethics, and [politics]{.mark}, that is **[devoid
of]{.mark} any real [normative import]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On such an
account, [[something simply becomes ethical **as soon as it becomes a
subject of concern**]{.mark}, and while our
environment]{.underline}---from genes to entire habitats---[certainly
can be an ethical concern, **not everything** that can become a concern
raises questions of an ethical nature]{.underline}.23 [While it is
certainly the case that our ethical responsibilities---as far as we can
still speak of the latter in consequentialist terms as real
responsibilities---**cannot seriously be limited** to other human
animals, it is **not entirely unproblematic** to **reduce the question
of ethics** to the **simple experience of an encounter** with others,
human and nonhuman alike, that highlights to us **nothing more** than
the "subtle involvements and relations between more-than-just-human
beings]{.underline}" (Smith 2011, xviii). [[If ethics]{.mark} is really
supposed to consist in an activist and creative interaction with others
that [**precludes moral judgment**, it does become **devoid of any
normative relevance** and tends toward a **romanticizing
aestheticization of the other**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}24 [Such a
romanticizing stance particularly comes to the fore when posthumanism
**takes on environmentalist concerns**]{.underline} but replaces, for
instance, arguments about marine pollution with a poetic description of
deep-sea life whose main contention is that, somehow, we are all of
oceanic origins.25 [**[Real]{.mark}** and **justiﬁed [concerns]{.mark}**
[about **global warming** are an]{.mark}other prominent [example for
such an ethical stance, but if the posthumanist
thesis]{.mark}]{.underline} of a ﬂat monist ontology [[**does indeed
hold water**, there is **no reason** to assume that global warming is
not **simply part of the system**]{.mark}, as it were]{.underline}.26

From a political perspective, [[ﬂat]{.mark} monist [ontologies lead to a
**diffusion of responsibility** which]{.mark} ultimately [**turns
against** those]{.mark} posthumanist [interventions that,]{.mark} in the
name of emancipation, [seek to hold]{.mark} a modern, [humanist
subjectivity responsible for **gender inequality**, **factory**]{.mark}
**livestock [farming]{.mark}**[, **global warming**, and]{.mark} the
**ills of neoliberal [capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.27 In the end,
it might even be the case, as Bennett (2015) suggested most recently,
that new materialism would have "to forego the category of the political
as such" (84). Although this might be pressing the point too far, [[it
**might not be possible** ]{.mark}**anymore** [to **differentiate**
between]{.mark}]{.underline}, say, [the **production of [udon
noodles]{.mark}** [and **presidential elections**]{.mark}, and if that
should really be the case, then [the demands]{.mark} of posthumanism and
new materialism [might neither be **ethically**, nor **politicially**,
**relevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While the consequences of posthumanism's and new materialism's ethical
stance thus appear questionable by their own standards, [what is at
stake is **not simply a lack of theoretical coherence**]{.underline}.
Rather, [in the background of political pitfalls and ethical vagueness
stands a **more serious philosophical problem**]{.underline}, that of
the naturalistic fallacy. For any posthumanist or new materialist
ethics, [the naturalistic fallacy proves **fatal**]{.underline}. This
problem becomes particularly obvious in a central claim---summarized in
exemplary fashion by Karen Barad---that shapes [the ethical and
political outlook of posthumanism and new materialism at
large]{.underline}. Relating the agency of matter directly to the
question of ethics, Barad draws on Emmanuel Levinas' understanding of
ethics as a ﬁrst philosophy grounded in the immediate phenomenological
experience of encountering "the other." The other, Levinas (1969)
[argues]{.underline}, is revealed in its "alterity" to the "I" and thus
creates an "irreducible relationship" that is centered on our immediate
response to the other, which he understands as the basis of ethical
responsibility (150 and 7980). While Levinas is far from being a
materialist philosopher, he does suggest that [our relationship to the
"material world" can]{.underline}, in principle, [repeat the structural
logic of "I" and "the other]{.underline}": "The primordial relation of
man with the material world is not negativity, but enjoyment and
agreeableness of life," and it is this move that allows Barad (1996) to
translate Levinas' theologically oriented assumptions into her account
of an "ethics of mattering"(Levinas 1969, 49; and Barad 1996, 391---96).
Ethics emerges in the agential dynamics inherent in matter, which
includes the human subject as constituted by its material agency. [As a
consequence, "the human subject is not the locus of ethicality," but
ethical relationships are **always part of the agency of matter**.
[Ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[is **not**]{.mark} **really
[concerned with norms]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} rather [with the
"**relationalities of becoming**]{.mark} of which we are a
part"]{.underline} (Barad 1996, 393). While it might certainly be
possible to describe the emergence of normativity along these lines,
[Barad goes much further, concluding that **all material agency** is
**essentially of an ethical kind**, since "\[m\]atter itself is **always
already open to**, or rather **entangled with**, the
'**Other**"']{.underline} (393). Since all material agency is
reciprocal, in one way or another, it does "respond" to other kinds of
agency, and since agency thus entails "the ability to respond to the
other," Barad deﬁnes "responsibility" in terms of responsiveness (392).

Short-circuiting Levinas' theological ethics of the other with the
monist ontology of new materialism ultimately gives rise to metaphysical
claims that withdraw from justiﬁcation: "A delicate tissue of ethicality
runs through the marrow of being. There is no getting away from
ethics---mattering is an integral part of the ontology of the world in
its dynamic presencing" (Barad 1996, 396). Of course, [[if **everything
is somehow ethical**]{.mark} as long as it is concerned with material
agency, [then **any ethical claim** could]{.mark} potentially [be
accepted: **human cruelty** might just be an **agential manifestation**
"intrinsic to the world's vitality," and the **agents of cruelty**
might]{.mark} very well merely [be "**responsive to the possibilities
that might help \[them\] ﬂourish**]{.mark}," since they are, after all,
"alive to the possibilities of becoming"]{.underline} (396).

#### Their disregard of ethical consequences ensures their politics devolves into crude social Darwinism

**Emden, 17**---Professor of German Intellectual History and Political
Thought at Rice University (Christian, "Normativity Matters:
Philosophical Naturalism and Political Theory," *The New Politics of
Materialism: History, Philosophy, Science*, Chapter 12, google books, no
page numbers, dml)

Regardless of the dynamics with which the validity of norms needs to be
justiﬁed for different contexts of ahistorically contingent lifeworlds,
[[ethics and morality are **detached** from our existence as **natural
beings**. This is]{.mark} particularly [the case as soon as we
**distinguish ethics** as dealing with **concrete**]{.mark} and
**particular [problems]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **[more
general]{.mark}** and **formal [principles]{.mark}** that are seen to
govern the normative order of morality]{.underline}, as Rainer Forst
(2012) points out.36 Morality, on this view, consists of "a system of
categorically binding norms, and corresponding rights and duties, which
hold reciprocally and universally among human beings qua human beings in
their capacity as moral persons, and which do not presuppose any thicker
context of interpersonal or communal relations (such as family, friends,
political community, and so on)" (Forst 2012, 43).

There are, of course, speciﬁc and understandable reasons why political
philosophy has refrained from extending its conception of normativity to
include nonhuman factors and agents. Deriving the structure of
normativity as categorically and universally binding among human
individuals from any natural facts about these individuals would fall
into the trap of the naturalistic fallacy. Moreover, [[**reducing
normative action** to **natural agency** can give rise to a **crude
social Darwinism** that]{.underline},]{.mark} from the vantage point of
critical theory, [[has done **considerable damage**]{.mark} to the
**emancipatory claims** of political philosophy and that]{.underline},
from a historical perspective, [has **undermined democratic pluralism**,
[as in the case of a **biologically grounded
racism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly, however, [[extending
normativity beyond the human world **undercuts** the **presumed
practical autonomy of reason** that allows for the **rational
justification** of **ethical** and **political claims** about the
world]{.mark} in which we have to live]{.underline}.

### Link---Settler Colonialism---Ontology

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99, dml)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40

But my unease was also emerging from something else, which is what I
want to focus on in this article: the problem that encounters and
conflicts are yet again made sense of within overarching structures of
knowledge production rather than cultivation (despite the intention to
do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes clear in the quotation
above, what is encountered as "different" is inevitably described "in
forms that I could understand" (my emphasis)---even whilst
simultaneously recognising that one's description does not capture what
the encountered practices actually do. Sense-making, for de la Cadena,
takes place at what could be called two levels: At a first level, there
is the inevitable process of making sense of an alienating affective
experience on the spot, from within one's own framework of understanding
the world. At a second level, then, de la Cadena attempts to make
legible her grappling and not-understanding in the context of a book for
an academically literate and interested audience---in other words, in
the writing-up of her ethnographic research.

In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given that their articles do
not aim to make an empirical contribution, sense-making takes place at
what could be called a third level: what is drawn upon is the
understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic work of others, which
is brought into conversation with various bodies of theoretical work in
order to make a conceptual contribution. This takes place via the
coining of central concepts and the outlining of all-encompassing
frameworks that are meant to help us understand the analytical,
normative and political consequences of their argument for scholarly
work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are used to
delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR and
beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place.

[This is]{.underline} also [the problem of some **central decolonial
work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard Glissant, Mignolo, for example,
critiques the "requirement of transparency" that forms the basis for
understanding in Western social science scholarship. He argues for [the
"**right to opacity**" of those located on the **other side of the
colonial difference**]{.underline}.41 But this claim sits at odds with
his simultaneous desire to write a new, all-encompassing history of "the
modern/colonial world system". 42 And like in Rojas' and Blaney and
Tickner's articles, terms such as "pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44
[are coined in order to have a (**one!**) concept for a **similarly
all-encompassing solution** to domination]{.underline}. While de la
Cadena is critical of her own "anxiety to understand coherently (with
which I meant clearly and without contradiction"), and while she points
out how [this]{.underline} "was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well
as Rojas and Blaney and Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such
[anxiety in **yet another coherent framework** that **holds everything
together**]{.underline}.

The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46

But as I have already indicated in relation to de la Cadena's work, when
writing up their research for academic purposes, even those who have
directly experienced ontological encounters find it hard to resist the
tendency to conclude their work with stringent, overarching, coherent
conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can grasp and "take home".
In the next section, I will draw on two anthropological ethnographic
texts that are significant for research on the GMO controversy to show
how this works. The two texts that will be analysed in the next section
engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay and Mexico respectively, and
they have stood out for me in the way they manage to convey a sense of
unease and grappling with ontological encounters and conflicts. However,
as the next section will show, they as well end up providing a framework
and conclusions that can accommodate and make sense of the encountered
ontological difference.

3\. Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy

According to Susana Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research
that is carried out in relation to the question of what smallholder
producers in the Global South truly think of (and say about)
agricultural biotechnology is unable to grasp the "ontological
incompatibility" that exists between the experienced human/nonhuman
relations in small-scale agriculture on the one hand, and the logic that
underlies genetic engineering (GE) on the other.47 This is precisely
because most social research is itself grounded in the crucial
modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the former can only be known
through scientific means, while the latter can be known through the
study of social/cultural/political practices. Knowledge about nature is
about establishing "facts", which are either true or false (i.e. nature
as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly represented), while
knowledge about culture is about studying meaning, which is necessarily
(due to the existence of different cultures) multiple.

The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual" danger
consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences, which
therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are made
about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else:

Until this point, I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion
with and about humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was
with what Antonio said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing
at the beans, and I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying
that this was a figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even
to claim that this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly
framed 'la soja mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather
than analysis itself worthy of response.50

However, Hetherington points out that not believing in the truth of the
killer bean did not prevent him from "participating in Antonio's
knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved in the anti-soy bean activism
of the peasants, Hetherington became "part of the situation" that made
the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in a court case that was
brought against two soy farmers for the murder of two activist peasants.
As a result, killer beans became transformed into a matter of national
concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation involved more than
joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief: it led to him
becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and beans that
started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's words, he
indeed became "partially connected": 52

Beans didn't scare me at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation
that gives rise to killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of
soy were a familiar, even a comforting sight. But it took only a few
months with Antonio for me to start feeling the menace from those
fields. Soon, the sweetish smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and
especially the corpselike smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin
my appetite and make me expect to see people emerge from their homes to
show me pustules on their legs and stomachs.53

Similar observations are also found in Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and Human Values symposium on the
challenges of making smallholder producer voices being heard in relation
to agricultural biotechnology.54 While most of the contributions to the
symposium concentrate on how to tease out smallholders' "real" voices in
the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda and Astier critically reflect on
their own perceived failure to become knowledgeable about smallholders'
voices in their research on GM maize cultivation in Mexico.

It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural areas in Central Mexico,
in-depth structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation
and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City with over 50
stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that Carro-Ripalda and
Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the actual voices of
peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55 However,
particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create conditions under
which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on their own terms about
GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the conditions of
exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56 The public
discourse that centres on questions of safety, science, possibilities of
regulation and problems of potential contamination, and which is upheld
by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists, dominated the
workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised different
concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main ones, as
if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all". The way
that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas, and
desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57

Carro-Ripalda and Astier are focused on the dominance of one particular
(techno-scientific, regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled
smallholder voices engaged in different discourses from speaking up or,
when speaking, from being heard. In other words, smallholders were
unable to adequately represent their own understanding of what is at
stake in the GM maize controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have
pointed out in the previous section, based on Rojas, difference is
thereby transformed into an epistemological, rather than an ontological
one: Carro-Ripalda and Astier's argument is implicitly based on the
assumption that, under the right conditions, difference can be
translated into something that can be communicated to, and discussed
with, other stakeholders. But the term "ontological incompatibility"
that the authors themselves use indicates there is something else at
play, which cannot easily be translated: the nature of the relation of
smallholder producers to their "land, seed, crop, climate ... as told
and understood by themselves"; the "central place" that Maize continues
to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic cosmology, and "the social and
cultural significance" that goes along with that.58

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the dominant
discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination this
discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the Mexican
agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to understand
what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is about. At
the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers whom they
have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable: at stake
for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their lives as
maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge, and their
ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access to their
'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional' ways of
agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort.

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's article is meant to render legible their own
encounter of ontological difference for an academic audience. Is it
possible for the reader to dig below these representational strategies,
and to relate more directly to their encounter of what they themselves
call ontological incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their
final workshop, in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a
few places in the article in which their inability to put into words and
arguments all of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons
that bind people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this
complexity is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62

Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we felt that that, through
our research on the ground, we had engaged with male and female farmers,
heard about their perspectives on GM and their visions of a rural
future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and markets. So, what do
smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What meanings did they convey to
us? We will provide here but a few of those sounds and meanings ... 63

Despite returning to the idea of voices as conveying "meaning" in this
quote, meaning is related to sounds, to walking together, to particular
places with their own sounds, smells, and colours. The sample of actual
"voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then choose to present yet again
invoke an intricate sense of the relationality of farmers and nonhumans:

It is a joy to plant, getting hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob
which is pleasant, to go to the harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all
regular. Because this is what sustains me.

You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ... You need to
look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the difference.

It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it \[for
replanting the following year\].64

By contrast, GM maize is associated by the smallholders whom
Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with feelings of "artificiality,
estrangement and distrust towards the created object (the GMO) in
itself, not only because of deep ontological considerations ... but
because of the political and economic motives which are 'assembled' into
it."65 Although the authors make a distinction between ontology and
politics/ economics here, their invoking of the "assemblage" precisely
shows how the latter becomes part of ontology itself, and then (as in
the case of Hetherington) impacts on the sensual, bodily connection with
the maize. Understanding the relation between "things" in this way
allows for an analysis of power and domination that has at least the
potential of moving beyond pre-given frameworks; strategically
suspending them in order to "sharpen \[the\] analysis of exactly how
power operates, how relations are made and undermined, and with what
consequences". 66 Genetically modified maize is a problem because it is
part of particular Mexican neoliberal visions and strategies, but in the
context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and Astier, that vision is not only
(and not even primarily) made sense of through given frames of
knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the exploitation of labour, but
sensually, through the way it disrupts the (physical) pleasure and joy
that has sustained the farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology
externalises the maize from farmers and estrange them from their ways of
life; and it is only through this externalisation that GM maize becomes
perceivable as a potential source of "contamination", as a danger
against which farmers need to "defend" their seeds.68

Now, some might counter that the previous paragraph in practice only
provides a fancy repackaging of the two well-rehearsed arguments brought
forward by many anti-GMO activists: (a) that the problem of GMOs is an
intrinsic property that makes it "unsafe" (which activists try to
scientifically prove), and/or (b) that the fundamental problem of
agricultural biotechnology is that it estranges farmers from their
traditional, ancestral way of life, that it allows for their
exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold for neoliberal
visions of how the world should be ordered. Both arguments are grounded
in modern ontology: the first goes down the route of science (contesting
"facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis of science itself),
while the second goes down the "social" route by either making a case
for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or for the need to
prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use of all of these
routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and intellectual
Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating character of the
GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time depicting
smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or indigenous
knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity through their
traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and Astier, this
"unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder producers as passive,
timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely the sort of
romanticised reification of "difference" that I have critiqued in the
previous section of this article---paradoxically, in this case, on the
basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it regards both "things"
and "people" as ontologically stable and classifiable.

By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed in this
section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by the
nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)?

This article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections.

4\. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections on What Questions to
Ask

The pull of hegemonic systems of academic knowledge production is
difficult to avoid. This is the case even in writings that are directly
based on ontological encounters and controversies, and that reflect on
the displacement that encountering different ontologies has entailed.
But as I have indicated, this problem is even more pronounced in
writings---like my own---that provide what I have previously called
"third-level" sense-making of ontological encounters.

The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a conceptual one,
which makes it by definition veer towards the general and abstract
rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on decolonial
thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in three
different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide an
understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the former
as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo Viveiros de
Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that ontology
can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as always being
"enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an understanding
of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines reality as "always
in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid assemblages". 73
Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards answering the
question of what reality as such, in general is about. Secondly, there
is an ambition to coin the general normative-political project that
arises out of this understanding with a singular concept, such as the
pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological multiplicity and the
emancipatory-decolonial political projects that arise out of its
recognition are written for an audience of a particular discipline, such
as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general rethinking, or,
indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74

What sort of questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and
what desire "to know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee
philosopher Brian Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions
we choose to ask are more important than any truths we might hope to
discover in asking such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is
always (at least in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge
of the form 'that something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified
by referring to direct experiences: "there must be something underlying
them and justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77

Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.

Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79

But even for those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical
research, there is space to push the boundaries of what can and should
be written about (and how). For decades there have been attempts to
provide "innovative" platforms, for example at conferences, to talk
about "stuff" in different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic
practices; not at least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80).
However, these "innovations" are still at the margins, and they will
most likely never be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge
production outlets such as journal articles and scholarly books. But
even within the latter, there is always at least some space to push for
more open-endedness, more reflection on the author's embodied
positionality, more auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even
if this is based on reading about the ontological encounters of others).

Although this sort of embodied self-reflection on a writer's
"situatedness" (which in my own case means being "on the colonising side
of a divide"81) has obviously been advanced by many critical scholars
for decades (including feminists and post- as well as decolonial
scholars), this article has hopefully shown that [there is still
(**always**) a **need to go further**, in order to **more fundamentally
challenge hegemonic**, **modern/colonial modes** of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The sense of unease that I have outlined in
section two was particularly strong when reading conclusions that were
geared towards making recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for
"international politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic
conclusions for** ]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**,
or [global "**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

### Link---Settler Colonialism---State

#### Their understanding of the state as unified, immutable, and inevitably dangerous to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline} that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism. 

**Lightfoot, 20**---associate professor in First Nations and Indigenous
Studies and the Department of Political Science, University of British
Columbia, Ojibwe (Sheryl, "The Pessimism Traps of Indigenous
Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter 9, pp
162-170, SpringerLink, dml)

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is **Unified**, **Deliberate** and
**Unchanging** in Its Desire to **Dispossess**]{.underline} Indigenous
Peoples [and **Gain Unfettered Access** to Indigenous Lands]{.underline}
and Resources

[In other words, colonialism by settler states is a **constant**, **not
a variable**, in both **outcome** and **intent**]{.underline}. Further,
the state is not only intentionally colonial, but it is also unifed in
its desire to co-opt Indigenous peoples as a method and means of
control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny it
a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years, 'the
state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to it'.27
According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders and
'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands to
accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a "solution" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of
Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still colonial insofar
as it remains structurally committed to the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples of our lands and self-determining authority'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states frst
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel [**limits** and actually **demeans
Indigenous agency**, **overlooking** the reality that **Indigenous
organisations themselves** chose the **human rights framework** and
**rights discourse** as a target sphere of action **precisely because**,
as was **evident** in earlier struggles like **slavery**, **civil
rights** or **women's rights**, these were **tools available to them**
that had a **proven track record of opening up new possibilities** and
**shifting previous state positions** and **behaviour**. Indigenous
advocates also **cleverly realised**]{.underline}, by the 1970s, [that
the **anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation frames** could be
**used together against states**. States did, **in no way**,
**nefariously impose a rights framework** on Indigenous peoples. Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
**deliberately chose** to frame their self-determination struggles
**within the human rights framework** in order to **bring states into a
double bind** where they **could not credibly claim** to adhere to human
rights and claim that they uphold equality while **simultaneously
denying Indigenous peoples' human rights** and leaving them with a
**diminished** and **unequal right of self-determination**]{.underline}.
But, because he is caught in [the pessimism trap of **seeing the state
only as unified**, **deliberate** and **unchanging**]{.underline},
Corntassel [**overlooks** and **diminishes** the clear story of
**Indigenous agency** and the **potential for positive change** in
advancing self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[Pessimism Trap 3: **Engagement** with the Settler State is
**Futile**]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

[Since the state always intends to **maintain**, if not **expand**,
**colonial control**]{.underline}, and is seeking to co-opt as many
Indigenous peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its
dispossession and control, [it is therefore **futile**]{.underline}, at
best, [and]{.underline} actually [**dangerous** to Indigenous existence
to engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**all patterns of
engagement** will lead to **co-optation** as the state is **cunning**
and **unrelenting** in its desire to co-opt]{.underline} Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and refective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political confgurations of power that we initially
sought...to challenge'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for 'critical
self-refection, skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of
recognition that seeks to practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and
economically nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign
authority grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous
legal and political traditions'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is created.41 He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly 'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of
inclusion' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
'channeled' and 'blunted' by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical
time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to bringing
Indigenous rights concerns to global forums'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus
the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

[All of these]{.underline} writers [advocate **Indigenous resurgence**,
through a combination of **rejecting**]{.underline} the current
reconciliation politics of [**settler colonial states**, coupled with a
**return to land-based Indigenous expressions** of governance as the
**only viable**, '**authentic**' and **legitimate path** to a better
future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
**decolonisation**]{.underline}. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, [all]{.underline} three theorists
[are]{.underline} also [**caught** in the]{.underline} same three
[**pessimism traps**: **authenticity versus co-option**; a vision of the
state as **unified**, **deliberate** and **never changing** in its
desire to **colonise** and **control**; and a view of engagement with
the state as **futile**, if not **dangerous**, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. When combined, [these]{.underline} three
pessimism [traps]{.underline} aim to [**inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement** with the state in **any process** that could potentially
**re-imagine** and **re-formulate** their current relationship into one
that could be **transformative** and **post-colonial**, as envisioned by
the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.
The]{.underline} pessimism [traps]{.underline} together work to
[**foreclose any possibility** that there could be **credible openings
of opportunity** to negotiate a **fairer** and **just relationship** of
co-existence with **even the most progressive state
government**.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} pessimistic approach [is **not innocuous**. By
**overemphasising structure** and granting the state an **enormous
degree of agency** as a **unitary actor**, this]{.underline} pessimistic
approach [**does a remarkable disservice** to Indigenous resistance
movements by **proscribing**, from **academia**, an **extremely narrow
view** of what Indigenous self-determination **can** and **should mean**
in practice. By **overlooking** and/or **discounting Indigenous agency**
and **not even considering the possibility** that Indigenous peoples
**could themselves be calculating**, **strategic political actors** in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the pessimistic lens]{.underline}
of the resurgence school [**unnecessarily**, **unproductively** and
**unjustly limits the field of possibility** for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus **actually countering** and **inhibiting
expressions of Indigenous self-determination**. By
**condemning**---**writ large**---**all Indigenous peoples** and
**organisations** that wish to **seek peaceful co-existence** with the
state, **negotiate mutually beneficial agreements** with the state,
and/or who have **advocated on the international level**
for]{.underline} a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a
positive guiding framework [for Indigenous-state relations, the
pessimistic lens]{.underline} of resurgence [**forecloses much potential
for new** and **improved relations**, in **any form**, and is **very
likely** to lead to **deeper conflicts** between states and Indigenous
peoples, and potentially, even **violent action**]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are therefore]{.underline},
likely [**self-defeating** for all but the **most remote** and
**isolated Indigenous communities**]{.underline}. Further, [this
approach is **quite out of step** with the **actions** and **vision of
many Indigenous resistance movements** on the ground who have been
**working for decades** to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
**domestically** and **globally**, in ways that **transform the colonial
state** into something **more just** and may eventually **present
creative alternatives** to the Westphalian state form in ways that could
**respect** and **accommodate Indigenous nations**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it aims to **shame** and **blame** those who wish to **explore
creative** and **innovative post-colonial resolutions** to the colonial
condition]{.underline}.

[The **UN Declaration**]{.underline} on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(the Declaration or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly
in 2007 after 25 years of development. The Declaration [is
**ground-breaking**, given the **key leadership roles** Indigenous
peoples played in **negotiating** and **achieving** this
agreement]{.underline}.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN
history, the rights holders, [Indigenous peoples, **worked with states**
to develop an instrument that would serve to **promote**, **protect**
and **affirm Indigenous rights**, both **globally** and in **individual
domestic contexts**.]{.underline}46

[Many **Indigenous organisations** and **movements**, from **dozens of
countries** around the world, were **involved in drafting** and
**negotiating** the UN Declaration and are now **advocating for its full
implementation**, both **internationally** and in **domestic** and
**regional contexts**]{.underline}. In Canada, some of the key
organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee),
the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were involved in the
drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations like the
American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights Fund have
been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous peoples' governing
institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and the Sami
Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights. In Latin
America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
**[major transnational Indigenous organisations]{.underline}**--- the
World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty
Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council---[were all **key members** of
the drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration,
and]{.underline} the latter two, which are still in existence,
[**continue their strong advocacy** for its full
implementation]{.underline}.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a signifcant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements. [States are **not
going to implement** this multifaceted and complex set of changes **on
their own**]{.underline}, however. [They will require **significant
political** and **moral pressure to hold them accountable** to the
**rhetorical commitments** they have made to support this level of
change. They will also require **ongoing conversation** and
**negotiation** with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process
becomes **problematically one-sided**. Such processes ultimately require
**sustained political will**, **commitment** and **engagement** over the
**long term**, to reach]{.underline} the end result of [**radical
systemic change** and Indigenous state relationships grounded in
**mutual respect**, **co-existence** and **reciprocity**. This type of
fundamental change requires **creative thinking**, **careful
diplomacy**, **tenacity**, and]{.underline} above all, [**optimistic
vision**, on the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The
**[pessimistic approaches]{.underline}** of the resurgence school
[are]{.underline} ultimately [of **little use**]{.underline} in these
efforts, [other than as a **cautionary tale** against state power, of
which the organisational players are **already keenly
aware**]{.underline}. Further, by [**dismissing** and **discouraging all
efforts at engagement** with states, and]{.underline} especially with
[the **blanket accusations** that all who engage in such efforts are
'**co-opted**' and not '**authentically**' Indigenous]{.underline}, the
resurgence school [actually creates **unnecessary negative feelings**
and **divisions** amongst Indigenous movements who should be **pooling
limited resources** and **working together towards better
futures**]{.underline}.

#### Reviving humanism begins at the level of scholarship by interrogating how our research comports with historically revolutionary ideals.

**Spencer, 17**---Senior Lecturer in Postcolonial Literatures and
Cultures at the University of Manchester (Robert, "Postcolonialism is a
Humanism," *For Humanism: Explorations in Theory and Politics*, Chapter
3, pg 121-126, dml)

It is well over a decade since Bruce Robbins marked 'a universalistic
and humanistic impulse that has gradually emerged, within cultural
studies generally and postcolonial studies in particular, but that was
slow to be perceived as such because of the prevailing antihumanism.'10
Notwithstanding this renewed interest in Said's humanism, I would
maintain, however, that [[humanism's]{.mark} partial
[rehabilitation]{.mark} **has not gone very far**]{.underline} at all.
[It **[has not yet affected]{.mark} fundamentally [the]{.mark} kind of
[work that we]{.mark}**]{.underline} postcolonialists [[**do**. It is
**one thing to** ]{.mark}**concede** that when it comes to, say, the
**assault on Iraq** it is **legitimate to [talk about]{.mark} rights**
and **duties**, about]{.underline} war crimes and **[crimes against
[humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That is part of our obligations and
activities as citizens. [[It is]{.mark} **quite [another]{.mark}
thing**]{.underline}, however, [[to **let**]{.mark} **such
[convictions]{.mark} guide** or **[animate fully our professional
lives]{.mark}** as critics too. My point]{.underline} in this chapter
[is **not** that we should **all carry a card** with the word
'**Humanist**' emblazoned on it, **nor** that we should **begin each
argument** with a **paean of praise** to the idea]{.underline}, nor even
that we should bother to use the word more often. I suppose I am arguing
that [in addition to being a **critical** undertaking postcolonialism
ought also to be a **moral** and a **political** one as
well]{.underline}. This being the case, I want to say, at the risk of
sounding facetious, that postcolonial studies should be exercised above
all not by crimes against hybridity but by crimes against humanity and
by the moral and political aspirations of those movements that seek to
withstand such crimes and to overthrow the system that inflicts them.
[Ours is the effort to understand **where colonialism comes from** as
well as how colonialism can be **superseded**; ours is the
**responsibility to make connections between local injustices** and then
trace these to the **general** and **related injustices of state** and
**class power**; [ours is]{.mark} also [the **obligation to
give**]{.mark} **due [emphasis]{.mark}** [to the **achievement of
texts**]{.mark} of various kinds [in **dramatising**]{.mark} **those
[injustices]{.mark}** [and **exploring
alternatives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is another way of saying that,
although Said's humanism is not in such bad odour as hitherto, humanism
has barely penetrated and informed the critical work that we do.
[Because humanism, at **worst**, conjures up images of **men in pith
helmets telling the world what to do**, or]{.underline} else, [at
**best**, comes across as a **quaint way of describing the convictions
we employ** when making political judgements, it **has not been allowed
to influence the priorities** of a discipline that]{.underline}, alas,
**[no longer sees itself]{.underline}**, as its predecessors saw
themselves, [as part of a **general movement for
emancipation**]{.underline}. It is now a trifling affair concerned with
the 'liminal' spaces opened up by a global system that it either
approves of or, more likely, that it despairs of being overturned. Of
course, [[it is **not hard** to find]{.mark} **exclusionary** and
'**metaphysical**' [definitions of humanism that]{.mark}, **far from
being acclamations of universal rights** and **capacities**, are in fact
**mere smokescreens for self-interest**. **Too many humanisms have
[excluded]{.mark}** and **denigrated certain [groups]{.mark}** whom they
consider [to be **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or at least not yet)
[**[fully human]{.mark}**. This is **especially true** of the humanist
rhetoric mouthed by the **agents** and **spokespeople of colonial
power**]{.underline}. 'The Mediterranean is the human norm', according
to the sententious narrator of A Passage to India, and through the
Bosphorus and the Pillars of Hercules men 'approach the monstrous and
extraordinary'.11 So blatantly intolerable is this pompous and obnoxious
way of thinking (remember it is, of course, not Forster himself speaking
here) that Anthony Alessandrini observes that 'it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find anyone within the field of postcolonial
studies willing to defend humanism in its most traditional form'.12
Impossible, in fact. What is more, it is of course quite right that this
should be so. For the libertarian humanism that I am endeavouring to
vindicate is as like the traditional version as a crab's like an apple.
Let nobody labour under the illusion that I am foolish enough to endorse
the sort of crass, self-seeking and ultimately racist humanism for which
to be black, say, in Aimé Césaire's celebrated quip, is 'like being a
second-class clerk': waiting for promotion, 'en attendant mieux et avec
possibilité de monter plus haut'. [What one **wouldn't realise** from
the **dismissal of humanism** as a kind of **unthinking belief** in the
**superiority of white European men**, is the **sheer variety of
humanisms** that have come into being **in response to such inadequate
understandings** of the term]{.underline}. In their Critical Humanisms,
Martin Halliwell and Andy Mousley demonstrate the extraordinary
durability and diversity of the humanist tradition.13 One thinks, in
addition to their examples, of the 'radical humanism' of the Holocaust
survivor Jean Améry,14 Karen Green's feminist humanism,15 not to mention
the variety of socialist humanisms enumerated by Barbara Epstein in this
volume. Most of all, I believe our attention ought to be trained on the
Marxist humanism of a tradition represented by Theodor Adorno, Ernst
Bloch and Herbert Marcuse, and of Jean-Paul Sartre, to whose celebrated
1945 lecture 'Existentialism is a Humanism' this chapter's title is a
respectful nod. My claim here is that [the **rejection**]{.underline}
over these last decades [of the idea that human subjects are **possessed
of intrinsic rights** and **capacities** bears out]{.underline} one of
Theodor Adorno's most cutting gibes: among its other functions,
'philosophy is capable of making people stupid'.16 I therefore propose
to describe what I believe are the **[deleterious
consequences]{.underline}** for postcolonial theory's development of its
constitutive antihumanism and especially of its neglect of the
liberating resources of a specifically Marxist humanism. I hope it is
not unfair to observe that the dominant though persistently disputed and
by now fairly beleaguered variety of postcolonial criticism shares
several identifying marks, or let us say precepts and assumptions, that
might with some justice be termed 'antihumanist'. I am referring less to
such sophisticated as well as theoretically and politically distinct
figures as Homi Bhabha and Gayatri Spivak, though I shall have a bit
more to say in due course about the former, than to the myriad of other
critics who draw on an idiom first promulgated by Bhabha and Spivak. I
am not endeavouring to tick off, say, Bhabha for being a card-carrying
antihumanist, not least because he has written in his preface to the new
translation of Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth in a
surprisingly sympathetic way about humanism.17 Rather, in addition to
showing that what Bhabha means by the term could scarcely be further
from Fanon's extremely militant account of a 'new humanism', [I want to
[identify a]{.mark} kind of **[disposition]{.mark}** or
**outlook**]{.underline} among most postcolonialists [[that is]{.mark}
not so much **stridently** antihumanist]{.underline}, though God knows
there is quite enough of that, [as **habitually** or **routinely** and
even **automatically** [antihumanist]{.mark}]{.underline}. To be a
postcolonialist, it seems, is to leave one's humanism at the door. [To
peruse]{.underline} the contents of any issue of the major
[journals]{.underline} in the field [is **more often than not** to be
confronted with **theoretical disquisitions** and
**analyses**]{.underline} of texts [that]{.underline}, whatever virtues
of acuity and originality they possess and notwithstanding their
informativeness, usually [address]{.underline} their readers [from a
position that is **tacitly antihumanist**. [They champion **difference**
at the expense of **equality**]{.mark}]{.underline}, deal with
narratives of cultural 'hybridity' without sufficient regard for the
continuing exigencies of conflict and struggle, and choose to abide by
the tenets and idiom of post-structuralism [[to the **detriment** of the
**revolutionary language** and **horizons** of]{.mark} the
**[previous]{.mark} generation** of [anticolonial militants]{.mark}. In
so doing]{.underline}, my claim goes, many postcolonial [[critics
have]{.mark} either **[forfeited]{.mark}** or have else been
**completely oblivious** of [the]{.mark} **very [valuable
resources]{.mark}** [of the **language of humanism**. They]{.mark}
therefore [**leave unexplored the larger realities** in which]{.mark}
such texts and [theories **circulate**]{.mark}, the world of
**imperialism**, of **capitalism**]{.underline} (from which imperialism
is inseparable) [and of the **counter-struggles** of imperialism's
victims]{.underline}. The reasons for [this **[aversion to
humanism]{.mark}**]{.underline} are complex, to put it mildly. They have
to do with the discipline's snug consolidation within (as opposed to
within and against) the Anglo-American university system as well as
within those countries' radically neoliberal economic dispensations,
dispensations which the world of higher education increasingly and quite
willingly serves. Speaking only of the British system in which I work,
it is a melancholy duty to have to report that any number of essential
academic freedoms and responsibilities have been buried in the last few
years beneath an avalanche of corporate waffle and management newspeak.
Few of us will need reminding of the consequences of the annexation of
British universities by the language and priorities of corporate power:
of how large our class sizes have become, of the casualisation of the
academic labour market, of funding crises and cost-cutting, of the
extortionate price of tuition fees (the intention of which is not to
save money but to turn students into indebted and thus pliant
consumers), and of the distortion of scholarly research by measuring it
against the risibly crude standard of 'economic contribution'. All of
these developments **[[deflect]{.underline}]{.mark}** the inhabitants of
these embattled institutions [[from]{.mark} the]{.underline} proper
[business of]{.underline} advanced **[education]{.underline}** in the
humanities, which is [[the **cultivation of an aptitude**]{.mark} for
asking **difficult questions** about culture and society]{.underline}.18
Postcolonial studies' materialist [critics have **long complained**
that]{.underline} the most prominent figures in the field, indeed [[the
field]{.underline}]{.mark} itself, [[has been **co-opted**]{.mark} by
its **privileged position** within this world of conformity and
privilege]{.underline}.19 [And yet it **would hardly be worth saying
such things** if universities were not **at the same time** also places
in which it is **still possible** to foster the **ability** and the
**confidence** to think **knowledgeably**, **rigorously**
and]{.underline} above all **[critically]{.underline}** about texts of
all kinds and about the realities with which texts deal. My point is
that the characteristic emphases of the postcolonial field cannot be
understood without reference to its institutional, geographical and
economic position. We need to be more self-conscious about that position
and more willing to work both within and against it. Now more than ever
[there is a **danger** that if postcolonial studies does not **present
itself consciously** as a discipline concerned **centrally** with
questions of **critique** and **liberation**, then it will]{.underline},
at worst, [end up]{.underline} as a kind of area office within an
enfeebled humanities sector. At best, it will become [a **disgruntled
subsidiary**]{.underline} of the humanities, **[dissatisfied with the
system]{.underline}** of which it forms a part [but whose **favourite
concepts** are to that system like so many **toy arrows**]{.underline}.
To let fall the word 'revolutionary' where one might be accustomed to
hearing terms like 'liminality' is already, therefore, to out oneself as
a humanist. This is because the concern with systems and with systemic
alternatives is usually seen as the preserve of an older anticolonial
past rather than of the postcolonial present. By demonstrating the
differences between Marxist humanism on the one hand and postcolonial
[[antihumanism]{.underline}]{.mark} on the other, I hope at least to
show that postcolonial theory as it is currently constituted [**[does
not possess]{.mark} anything like the [system-challenging
ambitions]{.mark}** of humanism, which seeks [to **marry
critical**]{.mark} and **theoretical [work]{.mark}** [to the **larger
context**]{.mark} of the struggle [to **replace**]{.mark} **the
manifestly [inhuman imperatives]{.mark}** of imperialism and capitalism.
This is a **quintessentially theoretical question** of
course]{.underline}, by which I mean that [it is a **crucial question**
about the **very purpose** and **context** of the **critical work that
we undertake**]{.underline}. We have, in my view, delayed for far too
long a rigorous and open discussion of what I see as the very
considerable disadvantages of the antihumanist theory that so many of us
seem almost automatically to deploy. Imperialism and its transformation
is the proper subject of our discipline; that being the case, we must
return in a suitably critical and discriminating spirit to the humanist
thinkers whose subject this was.

#### [Humanist ethics of care]{.underline} premised around [radical vulnerability]{.underline} [reconstructs]{.underline} emancipatory politics from the [bottom up.]{.underline}

Sandra **Laugier 16**, Professor of Philosophy at Université Paris 1
Panthéon-Sorbonne, "Politics of Vulnerability and Responsibility for
Ordinary Others," *Critical Horizons*, Volume 17, Number 2, May 2016,
pp. 207-223

[The point of [the ethics of care]{.mark} as a theory of responsibility
is]{.underline} hence to define citizenship by vulnerability. So
security, or rather [radical insecurity, [can become the basis
of]{.mark} a new, inclusive]{.underline} definition of
[citizenship]{.underline}, a citizenship not [defined]{.underline} (just
like security) by the protection of a particular state (just as human
security has been defined in terms of claims to security that belong
primarily to individuals and societies, and only secondarily to states),
but [by a **[protection of the human as such]{.mark}**, the human
including its fellow inhabitants of the Earth.]{.underline} The concept
of human security provides therefore a reformulation and enactment of
the capability approach. It harks back to this long history of normative
claims to protection and promotion of the vital interests of singular
human beings. But chiefly, as appears in The Idea of Justice (2009), the
point of view of human security is a bottom-up normative (philosophical,
political and social) conception.45 [[A bottom-up conception
reconstructs from]{.mark} below the **[ordinary demands of justice,
welfare, interests]{.mark}** etc., **[rather than accounting for]{.mark}
such [demands from above]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [[that]{.mark} [is,
from]{.mark} a description of **[perfect
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that is [applied only in later
stages]{.underline} to concrete circumstances. So [the]{.underline}
human security [approach can]{.underline} contribute to the heterodox
view of ethics we are calling for, by appealing to the bottom-up
approach, which emphasizes the role of social and individual grounds
rather than the outlining of institutions; and by
[appeal]{.underline}ing [to the bottom-up perspective of the dimension
of human needs, vulnerabilities, necessities etc]{.underline}. The
concept of human security is essential to a development of bottom-up
normative perspectives, bottom being human vulnerability. Adopting a
bottom-up model based on vulnerability can shed light on the importance
of political relations which is not perceivable within a top-down
approach, or with classical and conformist bottom-top approaches of
liberal democracies. [Political relations must be left open to the
questioning of a wide range of human relations, such as: care, trust,
familiarity, responsiveness and community]{.underline}, which are
generated in globalized societies, where people who are and remain
strangers are living together, and where one can encounter people in
further circles, making larger connections. These relations of trust and
reliance among strangers -- low or weak connections -- are vital to the
creation of a texture of security. [We need therefore to attend and tend
to those horizontal networks of relations and [communities]{.mark}
which]{.underline}, while not being strictly speaking political, [[have
an **expressive political relevance** through the]{.mark}
[**acknowledgement of vulnerability or precariousness**. It
is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[a democratic challenge]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the ethics of [care as a claim to]{.mark}
**protection and [promotion of the vital interests of]{.mark} singular
[human beings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Vulnerability also indicates today
contexts of life in which ordinary human beings find their needs,
interests and fragilities totally exposed, where the human form of life
itself, our life form, is threatened or collapses. These contexts of
extraordinary and ordinary life are governed by relations that cannot be
made even perceptible or visible through the orthodox concepts of ethics
(justice, impartiality, catalogue of duties, rational choice etc.).
[[Global change aggravates the exposition]{.mark} of human populations
[to]{.mark} **[situations of disaster in industrial
societies]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([tsunami]{.underline}, flooding, fire
disaster, earthquake, [health hazard, industrial contamination
etc]{.underline}.), [in a context of vulnerability to **various
[cumulated risks]{.mark}**[, created by the]{.mark} **[cumulative
carelessness]{.mark} towards some "invisible" human
being**]{.underline}. The question of human security and responsibility
today is enhanced by the addition of vulnerabilities created by the
cumulative carelessness towards some "invisible" humans, humans who do
not matter. Here again, [[the ethics of care]{.underline}]{.mark},
[conceived (cosmo)politically, [can lead towards]{.mark} renewed
[attention to the]{.mark} **[radical precariousness of human
situations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The solutions promoted by Sen to
support the cause of greater human security and care in/for the world --
"protection" (when people are too vulnerable, in too many ways and are
left to protect themselves) and "empowerment" (when people, with the
help of each other, can enhance their ability to withstand threatening
developments), in other words: "our ability to look after ourselves and
others" -- are clearly not enough, just as care fails in the face of
total vulnerability and the collapse of forms of life. [The
**disconnecting of citizenship and possession of rights**, the
development of a citizenship based on vulnerability]{.underline},
[is]{.underline} probably [the main challenge]{.underline}, in times of
global change, for a renewed conception of responsibility: a new version
of cosmopolitanism, or citizenship of a vulnerable world, not to be
asked for, nor conquered, but simply acknowledged as a reality.

#### Re-claiming an inclusive, revolutionary humanism is necessary to emancipatory politics. This directly combats the violent universalism of whiteness and European Man by rejecting restrictions on the creative potential of humanity 

Dr Richard **Pithouse 10**, senior researcher, programme co-ordinator
and supervisor at the Unit for Humanitites at Rhodes University, Frantz
Fanon and the Persistence of Humanism,
brotherwisedispatch.blogspot.com/2010/06/frantz-fanon-and-persistence-of.html

However, there are at least three reasons why we should defy current
orthodoxy and take Fanon's humanism seriously when we engage his
thought. The first is the simple point that [Fanon took his humanism
very seriously]{.underline}, and that a serious engagement with his work
must, in the interest of intellectual responsibility, do the same. The
second is that [[Fanon, and]{.mark} other anti-colonial thinkers like
Steve]{.underline} [[Biko]{.mark}, Jean-Paul [Sartre and]{.mark} Albert
[Memmi, were]{.mark} fully [aware that humanism had been used]{.mark} as
a legitimating ideology [for colonialism.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, unlike the postmodernists [[they didn't
see this as a reason for opposing humanism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Their
view was that this was a perverted form of humanism as it objectified
the bulk of humanity. Hence Sartre opened his preface to The Wretched of
the Earth by arguing that: \"Not so very long ago, the earth numbered
two thousand million inhabitants: five hundred million men, and one
thousand five hundred million natives.\" (1976:8) The anti-colonial
humanists thought that [**the [solution was to retain]{.mark} the idea
of [humanism but to expand it]{.mark} to include all of humanity**.
[This explains Biko's passionate attachment to a 'true
humanity]{.mark}\".]{.underline} [It is interesting to note that just
[at the time that the]{.mark} formerly subjugated people of the [Third
World were, through]{.mark} the language of [humanism, demanding their
place in the world, the West decided that humanism must be
abandoned]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Its replacement with the postmodern
cynicism about progress and emphasis on difference has been accompanied
by an **enormous setback** in the progress of the Third World and active
imposition of a rapacious neo-colonialism.]{.underline} **[[Although
humanism is rightly associated with Western hypocrisy, it must also be
remembered that it fueled]{.mark} Third World [resistance more
effectively than any]{.mark} of the [ideas that]{.mark} have come to
[replace it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Finally, it is important to note
that, very recently, a number of theorists have argued that [it is a
serious error to look at modernity and]{.underline} its legitimating
philosophy, [humanism]{.underline} [as is usually done, in a **reductive
way**]{.underline}. Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri do this particularly
well, and their work makes a useful starting point for an explanation of
the strand of humanism to which Fanon was so passionately attached.
REVOLUTIONARY VERSUS REACTIONARY HUMANISM Hardt and Negri argue that
[[there are two opposing humanisms in modernity -- one revolutionary and
one reactionary]{.underline}]{.mark}. In their view, modernity began as
a revolutionary movement in that 'the powers of creation that had
previously been consigned exclusively to the heavens are now brought
down to earth. This is the discovery of the fullness of the \"plane of
immanence.\" (2000:73) Immanence, they argue, is radical and
revolutionary in that it \"develops knowledge and action as scientific
experimentation and defines a tendency toward democratic politics,
posing humanity and desire at the center of history.\" (2000:74) They
understand immanence to refer to the view that the powers of creation
inhere in humanity and, more particularly, in the multitude rather than
The People. They define the multitude as 'the universality of free and
productive practices\" and The People as \"an organized particularity
that defends established principles and properties.\" (2000:316) But it
is perhaps more useful to note that they speak of the multitude in terms
of a disordered collection of desiring subjectivities and the people in
terms of an ordered collection of subjectivities disciplined in the name
of some transcendent power above and beyond the individual desires in
which creative powers are taken to inhere. That transcendent power may
be God or the Gods, ethnicity, The Nation, The Market, The Leader,
History, The Party and, of course, Europe or the West. Hardt and Negri
are resolutely against transcendence when transcendence refers to a
realm or agency outside the grasp -- in time, space or capacity -- of
the multitude. They insist that \"Immanence is defined as the absence of
every external limit from the trajectories of the multitude, and
immanence is tied only . . . to regimes of possibility.\" (2000:373)
They are committed to the revolutionary Renaissance idea of immanence
precisely because it puts the powers of creation in the hand of the
multitude and so they endorse, fully, the vision of human beings in a
perpetual state of becoming with regard to their mode of being, mode of
political organisation and material circumstances of existence. They do
not use the word 'transcendence\" to describe this overcoming of
facticity, but endorse the possibility and value of this transcendence
of facticity on the plane of immanence i.e. changing the facts of the
here and the now, by taking concrete action in the here and the now
rather than denying or diminishing the significance of those facts. They
celebrate immanence precisely because its leads to this type of
transcendence. However, Hardt and Negri argue that this revolutionary
assertion of immanence was opposed by: a counter revolution in the
proper sense of that term: a cultural philosophical, social, and
political initiative that, since it could neither return to the past nor
destroy the new forces, sought to dominate and expropriate the force of
the emerging movements and dynamics. This is the second mode of
modernity, constructed to wage war against the new forces and establish
an overarching power to dominate them. It arose within the Renaissance
revolution to divert its direction, transplant the new image of humanity
to a transcendent plane, relativise the capacities of science to
transform the world, and above all oppose the reappropriation of power
on the part of the multitude. The second mode of modernity poses a
transcendent constituted power against an immanent constituent power,
order against desire. (2000:74) Hardt and Negri argue that Bruno, Duns
Scotus and Spinoza were surpassed by Descartes, Hegel and Kant and so:
Victory went to the second mode and the forces of order that sought to
neutralize the power of the revolution. Although it was not possible to
go back to the way things were, it was nonetheless possible to
reestablish ideologies of command and authority, and thus deploy a new
transcendent power by playing on the anxiety and fear of the masses.
(2000:75) With regard to the poststructuralist critique of humanism they
argue that: \"Michael Foucault's final works on the history of sexuality
bring to life once again that same revolutionary impulse that animated
Renaissance humanism. The ethical care of the self reemerges as a
constituent power of self-creation.\" (2000:91) In their view there is
only an apparent paradox between Foucault's assertion of an
anti-humanism and the clearly humanist content of his later work. They
argue that: Antihumanism follows directly on Renaissance humanism's
secularizing project, or more precisely, its discovery of the plane of
immanence. Both projects are founded on an attack on transcendence.
There is a strict continuity between the religious thought that accords
a power above nature to God and the modern 'secular' thought that
accords the same power above nature to Man. The transcendence of God is
simply transformed to Man. Like God before it, this Man that stands
separate from and above nature has no place in a philosophy of
immanence. Like God, too, this transcendent figure of Man leads quickly
to the imposition of social hierarchy and domination. Antihumanism,
then, conceived as a refusal of any transcendence, should in no way be
confused with a negation of the vis viva, the creative life force that
animates the revolutionary stream of the modern tradition. On the
contrary, the refusal of transcendence is the condition of possibility
of thinking this immanent power, an anarchic basis of philosophy. (2000:
91-92) Heidegger's response to Sartre's Existentialism Is a Humanism is
often taken to have been a key influence in the anti-humanism of recent
French thought -- Foucault, Lacan, Derrida etc. Indeed often it is
claimed casually that Heidegger developed the definitive refutation of
humanism. As Dermot Moran explains, \"Humanisms remain metaphysical
concepts whereas Heidegger wants a thinking which is a thinking of
Being. Being appears through humankind, humankind is the 'shepherd of
Being' and 'language is the house of Being'.\" (2000:216) It seems clear
that Heidegger's critique of humanism is a critique of a specific type
of humanism -- the type which Hardt and Negri identify as reactionary
and explain as the replacement of the transcendence of God with the
transcendence of Man. So, although Heidegger's anti-humanism has been
very influential, it does not require a response here beyond pointing
out that his critique was of the strain of humanism identified by Hardt
and Negri as reactionary. In their view, modernity developed two
humanisms. [The first was the revolutionary assertion that human beings
exist in the plane of immanence and the second was the reactionary
assertion of a new transcendence in the form of Man. (And of course, as
Fanon points out, Man is European Man.)]{.underline} If we reflect a
little deeper than Hardt and Negri, it is clear that the
[[revolutionary]{.underline}]{.mark} form of [[humanism understands
human]{.mark} being[s]{.mark} [as having the potential to]{.mark} awaken
and [use]{.mark}, freely, their [creative energies to engage with and
change the material and symbolic realities of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} in which they found themselves. In this
vision humanity is seen as: (1) free and responsible for the exercise of
that freedom in the existentialist sense of being condemned to respond
freely to facticity, (2) capable of self creation in the sense of, in
Nietzsche's phrase, being in a perpetual state of becoming, and (3)
capable of changing the material and symbolic world. Moreover, [a high
value is ascribed to these three human capacities, and actions which
allow for their universal flourishing are taken to be good while
[**actions which inhibit them are taken to be bad**. There is a
connection between revolutionary humanism and]{.mark} a whole range of
[philosophies which emphasize]{.mark} human development, [freedom and
creative engagement]{.mark} with the world, [like Jungian psychology,
existentialism and *ubuntu*]{.mark}]{.underline}. Politically it has
direct connections with the such theories of liberation as classical
liberalism, anarchism, Marx's earlier humanist writing, Mikhail
Bakunin's vision of a society in which \"every human being should have
the material and moral means to develop all of his humanity\"
(1953:295); Marx's vision of a society in which 'the free development of
one is the condition of the free development of all\" (1983:197), and
John Stuart Mill's view that \"Liberty consists in doing what one
desires\" and that 'the sole end for which mankind are warranted\...in
interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is
self-protection.\" (1976:72-73 ) The best known contemporary defender of
revolutionary humanism is probably Noam Chomsky who, although he defines
his position as anarchist, celebrates John Dewey's vision of a society
\"of free human beings associated with one another on terms of
equality.\" (1996:75) Both humanisms are often, but not necessarily,
atheistic, but they always reject the idea that human beings can find
meaning in a transcendent, external God. However, [the
[reactionary]{.mark} strain of [humanism]{.mark} employs]{.underline}
two [secular strategies to fix and control humanity -- to turn a
multitude into a people. The first is to project the powers of creation
on to some transcendent realm]{.underline} or agent (Europe, the Nation,
the Leader, History, the Party, the Market, etc). [The second is to
[present]{.mark}, in the name of humanism, [one]{.mark} particular [mode
of being as]{.mark} the [normal]{.mark},]{.underline} highest [[or
best]{.mark} mode of being]{.underline}. This is, in and by itself,
repressive. Moreover, because the particular mode of being presented as
normal or ideal is often in the direct interests of the powerful, the
reactionary strain of humanism tends to be an oppressive ideology, for
example, when [[the idea of humanity is reduced to European
Man]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[There is, clearly, a profound difference
between]{.mark} the [enabling and]{.mark} expansive approach of
recognising and [encouraging]{.mark} the [fractious, anarchic
energies]{.mark} of the multitude [and the normalising]{.mark} and
restrictive [approach of reifying one image]{.mark} [of an ideal
humanity into 'Man'.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[The view that (European)
Man is anti-human is the pivot on which Fanon's entire project
turns]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and I will take it up shortly. But first I
will make some brief remarks on the relationship between Fanon's
immanence and his humanism.

[As]{.underline} the [[protesters]{.mark} revolt against the fact that
the lives of black human beings are considered as invaluable or even
disposable, they]{.underline}, however, ultimately [[call]{.mark} for
the recognition of their humanity, that is, **[for the black human being
to be recognized as human]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Evidently, the matter
of race is thus inevitably and inextricably bound to the question of
what it means to be human. At the same time, the question of the human
could be said to be more and more affected by [issues of
race]{.underline}, as they aim to [bring in long [histories of
oppression]{.mark}, exclusion, dehumanization]{.underline}, et cetera --
[histories that [are]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, [closely [connected
to the ways in which the human has been explained]{.mark} in the Western
world]{.underline}. It is precisely this all too often neglected link
between [dehumanization and]{.underline} traditional Western, or, to be
more precise, [Eurocentric humanism]{.underline}, that [forms the
starting point of this thesis]{.underline}. While it prides itself on
its universalism, [Eurocentric thought about the human has instead
founded itself on the binarism of Self and Other]{.underline},1 [which
has **marked a significant part of humanity** as the human's
Other]{.underline}. This thesis will examine a selection of
interconnected [theoretical and literary [texts]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[critically respond to]{.underline}]{.mark} and break with [the
[false universalism]{.mark} of humanism, [yet]{.mark}]{.underline}, at
the same time, [propose [to **imagine the concept of the human** in
alternative ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. The authors of these texts,
Frantz Fanon, Sylvia Wynter, Édouard Glissant and Octavia E. Butler, all
share the interest to invest in the notion of the human. In the upcoming
chapters, I will explore how they approach the question of the human and
what answers they provide us with.

Before introducing the works and thoughts of the four key figures of
this thesis, let me first further situate the question of the human in
the academic debates of today. It is, after all, an issue that, Jane
Hiddleston notes, "continues to preoccupy theorists of a whole range of
traditions and schools into the twenty-first century" (363). Through its
focus on the dehumanizing practices and discourses of the colonial
system, postcolonial studies could be said to have transposed the
question of the human from its predominantly Western context to the
world of the colonies and, as for today, former colonies. Though a great
number of postcolonial scholars and writers are concerned with the
rehumanization of the colonized or postcolonial subject, to write
him/her (back) into humanity so to speak, there is little consensus
among them about the terms "humanism" and "the human" (Hiddleston 363).
Nevertheless, [quite some key postcolonial thinkers]{.underline} such as
Fanon, but also for example Edward Said, seem to [express a firm belief
in the usefulness and value of the concept of the human.]{.underline}
That appears to be quite different in the slightly more recent field of
critical posthumanism, which calls into question the boundaries that
define humanity and critique the exceptionalism of the human species.
Much more than postcolonialism, the field of posthumanism sets out to
deconstruct the humanist notion of individuality. Although it seems that
posthumanism no longer wants to invest in the concept of the human, it
is important to keep in mind that one of its central questions is, thus,
precisely the question of the human.

Hiddleston furthermore argues that "current reinventions of the notion
of the human" -- whether these are postcolonial or posthumanist --
"surely remain indebted to the radical rejection of colonial humanism
\[...\] by anti-colonial and postcolonial critics" (364). This might
come across as a somewhat biased claim, for it seems to ignore the fact
that humanism and its perception of the human had, of course, been
criticized in history before. The humanist belief in human rationality
and autonomy obviously clashed with the perspective of Christianity, and
also the dethroning of reason by Western intellectuals in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century constituted a great challenge to
the then hegemonic conception of the human. Arguably most severe was the
criticism after the two world wars of the twentieth century; quite some
well-established European thinkers turned against humanism, as both wars
happened right "in the heart of the culture that considered itself to be
one of reason, progress and humanity" (Vanheste 1). It is, however,
important to note that these various so-called anti-humanisms could be
said to be biased themselves. As Gilroy points out, "neither humanism
nor antihumanism have been comfortable or enthusiastic when asked to
address the destructive impact of race thinking and racial hierarchy
upon their own ways of understanding history and society" (After Empire
5-6). Since contemporary reinventions of the notion of the human tend to
focus precisely on issues of difference, whether or not between human
beings or between human beings and other living and non-living entities,
Hiddleston might, then, just be right to designate anti-colonial and
postcolonial thought as the most important source of inspiration for
current debates on the human.

From the (former) colonies, quite a different story about humanism
emerged: one that does focus on racial hierarchies. [Humanism had
presented itself as the quintessential model of civilization, an
ideological belief that strongly informed and served as the
legitimization of the European invasion of supposed non-civilized parts
of the world]{.underline}. In fact, as David Scott brings forward in his
interview with Wynter, the birth of what he labels as Renaissance
humanism "is simultaneously the moment of initiation of Europe's
colonial project" (5-6). Far from spreading freedom and human dignity,
the "mission civilisatrice" (Hiddleston 363) led to the racialization,
oppression and dehumanization of a large part of humanity. It is this
oppressiveness of the colonial regimes that [[Fanon]{.underline}]{.mark}
writes against. In his powerful texts, he [amplifies the connections
between humanism, colonialism, and racism, yet at the same
time]{.underline}, and this is in stark contrast to the European
post-war anti-humanisms, [he [calls]{.mark} most persistently [for the
**invention of a new human**]{.mark}. It is,]{.underline} however, [of
great importance]{.underline} for Fanon [that [any attempt to rethink
the]{.mark} notion of the [human should be
**non-Western**]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, non-Eurocentric. This
thesis adopts this particular perspective; all the texts that will be
analyzed could be said to be explicitly, or at times somewhat more
implicitly, grounded in non-Western worlds.2

In Black Skin, White Masks (1952), but also in The Wretched of the Earth
(1961),3 Fanon confronts his reader with a multiplicity of experiences
of racism under the colonial regime. Despite, or perhaps precisely
because of the very intense degradation, he proves himself to be
combative, militant even, some would say. And although his life has
clearly been very deeply affected by what he describes as "the fact of
blackness" (Black Skin, White Masks 82), he does seem to also be
grateful for it, as he concludes: "O my body, make of me always a man
who questions!" (BSWM 181). [[His position as a black
man]{.underline}]{.mark} presumably forces him to interrogate and to
question the existing hegemonic systems and structures, and,
furthermore, [[allows him to imagine]{.mark} an alternative, more
[inclusive]{.mark} type of [humanism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[That is not
to]{.mark} say that he [plead]{.mark}s [for the inclusion of
all]{.mark}]{.underline} the excluded, i.e. dehumanized human beings in
the category of the human as formulated in Western humanism -- [[to
broaden the category]{.mark}, as it were]{.underline}.
**[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [he wishes to **[transform the
ways]{.mark} in which the concept of [the human is
perceived]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An important contribution to the
notion of the human is his concept of sociogeny, which Fanon introduces
to foreground the significance of social conditions to the formation,
or, as has been the case in the colonial situation, the determination of
one's consciousness. It is a term that hints at the potential of the
human, and although only explicitly mentioned once in these two specific
texts by Fanon, the concept of sociogeny has been crucial to Wynter's
project to reimagine the notion of the human.

Wynter writes about the damnés also of contemporary times.4 She
foregrounds that decolonization has never been fully realized, that the
colonial regime has only been replaced by a very similar organizing
principle, that is, neocolonialism. [The Western notion of the human
still presents itself as the only form of humanity]{.underline} -- which
Wynter aptly calls the overrepresentation of Man -- and, as such,
continues to control the ways in which human beings experience who and
what they are. Here, Wynter seems to gain support from Gilroy, who
observes a reappearance of racial sentiments "under the sign of progress
and globalization" (After Empire 12). Fanon's term damnés has, thus, not
at all lost its pertinence. Though it is his concept of
[sociogeny]{.underline} that takes center stage in Wynter's body of
thought. It enables her to [expose the currently overall accepted
scientific "truth" of what makes up the human]{.underline}, namely, that
human beings are biological beings who are merely driven by their genes,
[to be **one of a series of human-made narratives**]{.underline} -- a
particularly stubborn narrative, as its scientific character appears to
simply rule out any alternative. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
Wynter, [[most important to]{.mark} also [think of the]{.mark} [human as
a storyteller]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a "homo narrans"
("Unparalleled" 25) [[who]{.underline}]{.mark}, throughout history,
[[has]{.mark} had [the ability to **continuously reinvent the
narrative**]{.mark}]{.underline} by which he/she understands himself.
With her take on Fanon's sociogeny, [she highlights the human's
potential to bring about change]{.underline}; after all, as Wynter
stresses, [the [stories that]{.mark} aimed to [explain the human **have
been rewritten by human beings before**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Her project to come to terms with the human thus leads Wynter to argue
strongly -- and quite convincingly -- in favor of the imagination and,
consequently, literature. It could be argued that also Fanon identifies
this as the forte of his concept of sociogeny, for in the final pages of
Black Skin, White Masks he states that "the real leap consists in
introducing invention into existence" (179, second emphasis added).
Literature is the site of exploration, where [[the existing]{.mark}
[hegemonic story]{.mark} of the human and the concomitant humanist
discourses of logic and reason [can be countered]{.mark} and disproved,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, most importantly, [where **[a new human,
or]{.mark} a [new humanism]{.mark}** [can be]{.mark}
[imagined]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 The selection of novels that will be
discussed in light of Fanon's and Wynter's theoretical lines of thought
-- Glissant's The Fourth Century (originally published as Le Quatrième
Siècle in 1964) and The Overseer's Cabin (originally published as Case
du Commandeur in 1981),6 and Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy (1987, 1988,
1989)7 -- all contribute to such a reimagination of the human. As they
critically respond to the fallacies of the Eurocentric version of the
human, both Glissant and Butler depict, invent, and experiment with
[different ways of being human]{.underline} that [foreground the
relationality of human beings.]{.underline}

### Perm---2NC

#### Framework: the role of the ballot is to align pedagogy with liberatory radical traditions---that's Spencer. This means comparing [habits of thinking]{.underline} and deciding whose method better comports with [historically radical activism]{.underline} and [literature]{.underline}. Voting neg honors the struggles and gains of radical humanist movements through history by using debate to develop a humanist pedagogy of hope. If we win a link, it means the perm is impossible because "we cannot acknowledge that the past informs us and simultaneously assert the past is irrelevant to present and future struggles."

**Sefa Dei, 10**---professor at Ontario Institute for Studies in
Education of the University of Toronto (George, "FANON AND ANTI-COLONIAL
THEORIZING," *Fanon and the Counterinsurgency of Education*, Chapter 2,
pg 24-26, dml)

[To contest the future we must **claim** and **reclaim the wholeness of
being** and **bring politics** and **agency to our work** as educators,
learners and practitioners. We **cannot afford to compartmentalize our
work** and **individualize ourselves**]{.underline}. Fanon is credited
with the notion of 'amputation' that is, to sever ties or connections.
While the notion evokes biological images of 'disability' I still think
we can work with the concept in lieu of a more appropriate
term/terminology. That is, to accentuate the need for the decolonizing
project to cast away? that which the colonized has damaged (e.g.,
decolonizing the mind and body, sheds the legacies of dehumanization and
depersonalization). [The **way forward** for anti-colonial education is
for **educators** and **learners** to work together to **create
decolonized spaces** that allow for **rethinking** of notions of
'identity' and 'belonging' 'history' 'culture' and
'politics']{.underline}. For the oppressed, I see this form of education
as reclaiming education (see also Rich, 1979). [Fanon **was not about a
total negation** or **denigration of the past**]{.underline}, culture
and tradition (see also Dei, 2010b). At one level, [there **must
be**]{.underline} a 'resistance to amputation' that is a [**resistance**
to a **total severing of any connection** to that which **helps the
oppressed to resist** -- **history**, **past** and its **lessons of
resistance**. We **must resist any call** for the **severing of ties**
with any **history**, **culture** and **tradition** that **strengthens**
and **helps us challenge domination** and **colonization**]{.underline}.
Obviously there are significant pedagogical challenges. In the 'Fact of
Blackness", Fanon concedes and acknowledges a resistance to amputation
of the past, that is, a challenge to "an amputation, an excision" of a
part of the Black body (Fanon, 1967a, p. 112). He writes, "nevertheless
with all my strength I refuse to accept that amputation" (Fanon, 1967a,
p. 140). He would add, "without a Negro past, without a Negro future, it
was impossible for me to live my Negrohood" (p. 138). [We **cannot
acknowledge** that the **past informs us** and **simultaneously assert**
the past is **irrelevant to present** and **future
struggles**]{.underline}.

Sure, we should let the past imprison us. We cannot be too steeped in
the past. So then how are we to interpret Fanon's (1967a) exhortations
in the concluding chapter of: Black Skin, White Masks? "In no way should
I derive my basic purpose from the past of the peoples of color" (p.
226). Or, that "I would not make myself a man of the past (p. 226)? He
also goes on to write "I do not want to exalt the past at the expense of
my present and of my future" (p. 226) and that the "Vietnamese who die
before firing squads are not hoping that their sacrifice will bring
about a reappearance of the past. It is for the sake of the present and
of the future that they are willing to die" (p. 227).

We can only confer that Fanon was more interested in a "living past" not
a reclamation of a "dead and fossilized past". In other words, to Fanon
[the past was **only relevant** if it **informs political** and
**liberation struggles** of the present **not** in their **mere
recuperation**, **celebration** or **valorization**]{.underline}. In The
Wretched of the Earth, Fanon (1963) was emphatic that [we "**must use
the past** with the intention of **opening the future**, an **invitation
to action** and a **basis of hope**]{.underline}. But to ensure that
hope and to give it form, \[we\] must take part in action and throw
\[our\] body and soul into the national struggle" (p. 232). [This is an
**investment in the past** for purposes of **transforming futures**. Our
evocation of the past **must not be reactive** or **reactionary**. The
past **cannot simply be** about looking to find "**coherent elements**
which **counteract colonialism's attempts to falsify** and
**harm**"]{.underline} (Fanon, 1963). [The past is **relevant** if it
helps us "**construct the future** and to **prepare the ground** where
vigorous shoots are **already springing up**"]{.underline} (Fanon, 1963,
p. 233).

[A **pedagogy of hope**]{.underline} (see also Freire 1994), [which
**celebrates the indomitable human spirit**, teaching love, justice and
healing, is **important to contest**]{.underline} a future so
over-determined [**current geo-political forces of colonial** and
**imperial encounter**. A pedagogy of hope allows us to **bring emotions
to our work** and for it to **propel action**. It is about a
**conviction** that there **will be success** at the end of a struggle
and that **hope for a better future** has to be **struggled for** and
**gained**. A pedagogy of hope is about **coming to know
holistically**]{.underline}. A pedagogy of hope is teaching about
diverse and multiple knowledges, including the active learning of
multiple cultures, histories, experiences and knowledges emphasizing the
complexities of such knowledges). Such pedagogy seeks to promote and
enhance local/Indigenous culture and languages and break the false
separation between the 'school' and the 'home' or off-school culture. A
pedagogy of hope creates spaces of knowledge and power-sharing for
family/community involvement in schools (i.e., in areas of pedagogy,
instruction and curricular development) and emphasizes instructional and
pedagogic practices that herald collective learning and responsibility
by redefining 'success' broadly to include academic and social success.
Such a pedagogy of hope also promotes curricular and instructional
approaches that foreground questions of social difference and power
relations (race, ethnicity, gender, class, language, \[dis\]ability,
religious, age, and sexuality issues). [It seeks to **heal wounds of
colonizing** and **oppressive relations** and **practices** and
**cultivates in all learners agency** and **upholding the**]{.underline}
virtues of spiritual, emotional, psychological and \[moral\] values
[**development** of a **whole being**. Such a pedagogy of hope **assists
learners to believe** in their power to **transform their
circumstances** and to **create a better future for all**. This
is]{.underline} the **[critical humanism]{.underline}** that Fanon wrote
about [as the creation of a **new social world**]{.underline}.

#### The perm fails---our links demonstrate the aff's grounding in a [particular]{.underline} understanding of subjectivity, which can only create [false]{.underline} universality and the [reification]{.underline} of oppression. The alt's understanding of a [common human subject]{.underline} is [mutually exclusive]{.underline}.

**Sharma, 15**---Director, International Cultural Studies Program,
University of Hawai'i Manoa (Nandita, "Strategic Anti-Essentialism:
Decolonizing Decolonization," *Sylvia Wynter: Being Human as Praxis*,
Chapter 7, pg 168-170, dml)

Wynter's insistence that [an examination of people's **modes of
subjective understanding** tells us something]{.underline} very [useful
about **how to end practices of colonization**]{.underline},
specifically her understanding of humans as being "hybridly" organic and
"languaging" life forms. [All humans]{.underline}, she argues, [have
"**culture-specific** system\[s\] of symbolic
representation,"]{.underline} which alone influence our "modes of
conspecificity."14 It "is [on the basis of]{.underline} that mode \[of
**[subjective understanding]{.underline}**\]," she adds, "that the
[subjects of each human order]{.underline} are enabled to [**experience
themselves as symbolic kin** or **interaltruistic
conspecifics**]{.underline}."15 [**Particularistic modes** of
essentialist subjective understandings **inherently create a limited
sense** of conspecificity, one that **continuously creates the
conditions** for the **subjugation of others**]{.underline}. This is
because [**any particularistic propter nos** is practically
"**impervious to philosophical attack**" and "impervious also to
**empirical counterevidence**."]{.underline}16 Hence, [those within it
are often **unable to see the shared humanity** of those imagined as
outsiders]{.underline}.

Therefore, Wynter proposes that "the central mechanism at work" in
processes of colonization---and even decolonization---"was and is that
of representation."17 [It is through **strategies of representation**
"that each human order and its culture- specific mode of empirical
reality can be **brought into being**]{.underline} as a 'form of
life'."18 And, importantly, **[who we think we are]{.underline}**---be
it "Spanish" or "European" or "Aztec" or native---and who our co-
specifics are (those with / for whom we feel we have a connection) [has
**significant effects** on our actions]{.underline}. Wynter shows, for
example, how the "Spanish" conquistadores were as incapable of imagining
the "Aztecs" as their co- specifics as the "Aztecs" were in their view
of other groups in (what is now) Mexico. The [actions]{.underline} of
both the Spanish and the Aztecs [were **limited** by]{.underline} their
[**partial**, **subjective understanding**]{.underline} of themselves.
[The problem of **partial perspectives** on being human]{.underline},
then, [is]{.underline} one that is [**shared** across the line of
**colonizer/colonized**]{.underline}.

Hence, Wynter calls for [another]{.underline} root [expansion in
thought]{.underline}, one that can imagine the propter nos as one
[**encompassing all humans** as a species]{.underline}. This possibility
[exists **not in the abstract** but in the **acknowledgment** that human
beings are **deeply interconnected** with one another]{.underline} and
with the environment of which we are a part (although, unfortunately,
Wynter's call does not extend to nonhuman life).19 [This connectivity
**remains real even as**]{.underline} the [**groups** and
**territories**]{.underline} we are said to belong to [are
**ideologically rendered** as being **particularistic**]{.underline}
(e.g., the United States as a "white" space) [or as our **connections to
each other** across spaces are **denied**]{.underline} (e.g., we are
"American"). Indeed, as a result of the global expansion of ruling
relations, life on the planet and thus [our diverse planetary lives and
ties are]{.underline} perhaps [**more connected** to each other than
**ever before**. This, along with the **threat of nuclear destruction**
hanging over all of our heads]{.underline} for the last sixty- odd
years, [shows us that our **futures** are also **intimately related**.
It is the **reality of these connections** and our **shared need to
secure the conditions of continued life** that may]{.underline}, Wynter
argues, [make it possible for us to **accept each other in
toto**]{.underline}, as a truly co- identified species.

In Wynter's proposed "human view" of 1492, [the possibility of
**aligning our subjective understanding** of ourselves with our **social
reality of interconnectivity** is ours, **if we want it**. If the
opportunity to do so is **taken**, we may be able to
**win**]{.underline}, Wynter argues, [the "**true victory**" promised by
past expansions in our understanding of our co-humanity that **remain
incomplete**]{.underline}.20 To do so, [we both need to **transform the
systems of symbolic representations** we use and make an **equally
transformative change** in our **relationships** to each
other]{.underline}, relationships [that]{.underline}, today, continue to
[**hierarchically value people** so that our ability to live a healthy,
peaceful, and dignified life **remains**]{.underline} as
**[unequal]{.underline}** as the terms of the initial Columbian
exchange.21 I turn now to an examination of attempts at expanding our
imagination of propter nos as well as current attempts to narrow it.
[This]{.underline}, I believe [will help us **clarify the political
choices** that we currently face and which are ours to
make]{.underline}.

### AT: Enlightenment Thought Bad

#### Enlightenment understandings of humanity were always fractured -- anti-Imperial strands in universal humanity should be recognized. There was a robust strand of anti-Imperial universalism that criticized dispossession and slavery.

[[Do commitments to the idea of a shared humanity]{.underline}]{.mark},
to human dignity, to cross-cultural universal moral principles, [and to
cross-cultural standards of justice [rest upon
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline} and values [[that unavoidably
denigrate]{.mark}, or]{.underline} that disturbingly [undermine [respect
for, cultural pluralism]{.mark}]{.underline}, that is, the wide array of
human institutions and practices in the world?16 [[Are they
imperialistic]{.mark} either [explicitly, to justify
Europe\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} political, military, and commercial
[[subjugation]{.mark} of the non-European world, or implicitly, [by
indicating a rank ordering]{.mark} of superior and inferior peoples,
[which]{.mark} could [then]{.mark} be used to [justify
a]{.mark}]{.underline} more indirect, quasi-imperial [['civilizing'
process]{.underline}]{.mark}? [[The]{.mark} aforementioned [commitments
are]{.mark} sometimes collectively [gathered under the term
'Enlightenment universalism']{.mark} and]{.underline}, as we have seen,
[[they]{.mark} are [sometimes]{.mark} considered to [constitute the core
of 'the Enlightenment project']{.mark}]{.underline}. I have suggested
already that [[such assertions]{.mark} mask and distort a complex
reality]{.underline}. In this case, [they [obscure the multiplicity of
universalisms across]{.mark} eighteenth-century [European political
thought, each with]{.mark} distinct foundational claims, [varying
relationships to]{.mark}]{.underline} conceptualizations of human
diversity and to [[humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} (which themselves
differ from thinker to thinker, and even from text to text), and
different political orientations toward the nature and limits of state
power in theory and in practice. These philosophical sensibilities and
approaches can yield remarkably dif-ferent political arguments toward
foreign peoples, international justice, and imperialism. Thus, [rather
than ask whether 'the Enlightenment project' and 'Enlightenment
universalism' are compatible with]{.underline} an appreciation of
[cultural pluralism or whether they are at bottom imperializing
ideologies, it is more constructive to pose more precise and
historically accurate versions of such questions with regard to
particular texts and thinkers]{.underline}.

In this book, I have studied [[a distinctive variant of Enlightenment
writings against empire]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[which includes
the]{.underline}]{.mark} philosophical and political [[arguments
of]{.mark} Diderot, [Kant]{.mark}, and Herder]{.underline}. While there
is no such thing as \'Enlightenment universalism\' as such, let alone a
larger \'Enlightenment project\', [there [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
nonetheless [[an identifiable set of]{.underline}]{.mark} philosophical
and political [[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}, assumptions, and
tendencies [[about the relationship between universal and pluralistic
concepts]{.mark} that animates the strand of Enlightenment political
thought]{.underline} under study here. With this in mind, one can more
meaningfully ask what the relationship is between universalism,
pluralism, and incommensurability in such political philosophies, and
how precisely they yield anti-imperialist political commitments. Answers
to these more circumscribed questions can be given by better
understanding the core elements of Diderot\'s, Kant\'s, and Herder\'s
political philosophies, and how they \[END PAGE 345\] differ from
earlier (and, indeed, from many later) understandings and judgements of
empire. Immanuel Kant remarks pointedly in Toward Perpetual Peace that
the Europeans who landed and eventually settled in the New World often
denied indigenous peoples any moral status.

When America, the Negro countries, the Spice Islands, the Cape, and so
forth were discovered, they were, to them \[to Europeans\], countries
belonging to no one \[die keinem angehorten\], since they counted the
inhabitants as nothing. (8:358, emphasis added)

[What philosophical]{.underline} concepts and [arguments were necessary
for New World peoples to be counted finally as something and especially
to be considered as equals]{.underline}, as they were eventually in some
crucial respects, [by anti-imperialist political thinkers]{.underline}
in the Enlightenment era? In this section, I focus on what I have taken
in this book to be the philosophically most robust strand of
Enlightenment anti-imperialist political thought. 17 Despite the many
differences in the ethnographic sources that Diderot, Kant, and Herder
consulted, the philosophical languages that these thinkers employed, and
the particular concepts they drew upon to attack European empires, their
anti-imperialist arguments intriguingly overlap in important respects.
Thus, in this section, I identify and elucidate the family resemblances
that exist among their philosophical arguments and rhetorical
strategies, and discuss the underlying assumptions, ideas, and
intellectual dispositions that make their version of anti-imperialist
political thinking conceptually possible. In contrast to what is
effectively the premiss of the kinds of familiar questions asked at the
opening of this section, the commitments of Diderot, Kant, and Herder to
moral universalism, cultural diversity, partial incommensurability, and
the delegitimization of empire are not fundamentally in tension but
rather reinforce one another.

Overall, [[there are three]{.mark} principal [philosophical sources of
Enlightenment anti-imperialism. The first]{.mark} and most basic idea
[is that human beings deserve]{.mark}]{.underline} some modicum of
[[moral and political respect]{.underline}]{.mark} simply
[[because]{.underline}]{.mark} of the fact that [[they are
human]{.underline}]{.mark}. This humanistic moral principle alone,
however, was far from sufficient for engendering an anti-imperialist
politics. The whole modern tradition of natural right and social
contract theory held this view in some form. Moreover, Amerindians in
particular were explicitly \[END PAGE 346\] described by such thinkers
as the pure, natural humans of the state of nature. Yet much of this
tradition of modern political thought, from Grotius onward, was either
agnostic about imperialism or lent philosophical support to European
empires. Not every understanding of what it means fundamentally to be a
human fosters the philosophical materials necessary to build a more
inclusive and pluralistic political theory that could serve as the basis
of anti-imperialist arguments. Indeed, as I will argue, some
understandings of humanity that are manifestly egalitarian can
nevertheless impede such a development. Second, therefore, [[these
anti-imperialist arguments rested upon the view that human beings
are]{.mark} fundamentally [cultural beings]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Diderot, Kant, and Herder all contend that the category of the human is
necessarily marked by cultural difference; in this view, [[humanity is
cultural agency. This]{.underline}]{.mark} thicker, [[particularized
view of the human subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, paradoxically,
[[helped]{.mark} to [engender a]{.mark} more [inclusive]{.mark} and
meaningful [moral universalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [a fairly
robust account of [moral incommensurability and relativity was]{.mark}
also [necessary for the rise of anti-imperialist political thought. The
anti-imperialist arguments]{.mark} offered by Diderot, Kant, and Herder
all partly [rest upon the view that peoples]{.mark} as a whole [are
incommensurable]{.mark}. From this perspective, entire peoples cannot be
judged as superior or inferior along a universal scale of
value]{.underline}. Moreover, in distinct but closely related ways,
[these thinkers argue that [our cultural freedom produces]{.mark} a wide
variety of [individual]{.mark} and collective practices and [beliefs
that are incommensurable]{.mark}]{.underline}, given their view that
many practices and beliefs lie outside the bounds of a categorical
judgement or universal standard. [When these three conceptual
developments were brought together, the strand of Enlightenment
anti-imperialist political theory]{.underline} that I have identified
[became philosophically possible]{.underline}. I want to reiterate here
that this framework is not meant to elucidate all of the
anti-imperialist arguments that one can find in the philosophical
writings of the Enlightenment era. Moreover, the distinc-tive
intellectual dispositions, personal idiosyncrasies, and domestic
political commitments of Enlightenment-era thinkers significantly shaped
their particular arguments on the issue of empire. Still, as I will
show, these three philosophical ideas play a crucial role in enabling
the development of a rich strand of anti-imperialist political theory in
the late eighteenth century. In discussing the development of a more
inclusive and anti-imperialist political theory, my focus in this
section (as it has been generally in this book) is on Europeans\'
political attitudes toward non-Europeans. Many thinkers in non-European
societies clearly operated with similarly self-centred conceptions, but
my emphasis throughout is on Europeans\' intellectual responses to the
fact of cultural difference and imperial politics, not with non-European
peoples\' understandings of each other or of their ac-counts of European
peoples. Nor do I examine here the variety of intra-European
distinctions between allegedly superior and inferior groups, those, for
instance, involving linguistic, geographical, class, religious, and
gender differences, which of course historically also legitimated
differential treatment within European societies. Thus, I do not intend
to argue that Enlightenment anti-imperialist political philosophies are
inclusive as such, for their underlying principles do not necessarily
(and, in the eighteenth century, they manifestly did not) support
egalitarian \[END PAGE 347\] arguments against every form of exclusion.

As I have noted, [the first idea that enables Enlightenment
anti-imperialism]{.underline} -- first both historically and
analytically -- [is that foreigners are human beings and]{.underline},
consequently, [that they deserve moral respect, however understood. The
development]{.underline}, in other words, [of some variant of a
[humanistic moral universalism ensured]{.mark} that [the shared humanity
of both Europeans and non-Europeans would be
acknowledged]{.mark}]{.underline} and given some due. The philosophical
and political legacy with which Enlightenment anti-imperialist thinkers
struggled, as they themselves understood, was one of exclusion. As they
often noted, [[ethical]{.mark} principles of [respect and reciprocity
had been limited]{.mark} almost always [to]{.mark}]{.underline} (some)
[[members of one\'s own]{.mark} tribe, polis, nation, religion, or
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accordingly, the distinction between
one\'s own society, however defined, and the barbaroi (others,
foreigners), whether justified outright or tacitly assumed, influenced
not only the anthropological conceptions of, and popular understandings
about, foreign peoples, but also legitimated the often brutally
differential treatment of various groups. It is along these lines that
Kant expresses dismay, in a lecture on moral philosophy, at what he
calls the \"error that the \[ancient\] Greeks displayed, in that they
evinced no goodwill towards extranei \[outsiders, or foreigners\], but
included them all, rather, sub voce hostes = barbari \[under the name of
enemies, or barbarians\]\". (27:674) In the long history of imperial
exploits, actions that in at least some contexts might have provoked
outrage in one\'s own land not only gained legitimacy on foreign soil
but were deemed praiseworthy, noble, and even morally obligatory abroad.
[While European imperialists in the New World, writes Diderot,
\"faithfully observe their own laws, they will violate the rights of
other nations in order to increase their power. That is what the Romans
did."]{.underline}18 [[Enlightenment anti-imperialists recognized that
such Janus-faced practices constituted the very core of imperial
activity]{.mark} from the empires of the ancient world to the imperial
conquests and commercial voyages of their day. The fact of difference
itself lay at the heart of such inconsistent behaviour]{.underline} from
Europeans\' initial encounters with Amerindians onward, [as Diderot
notes: \"\[[t\]he Spaniard]{.mark}]{.underline}, the first to be thrown
up by the waves onto the shores of the New World, [[thought he had no
duty to people who did not share his colour]{.underline}]{.mark},
customs, or religion.\"19 Not wanting to single out the Spanish, Diderot
suggests further that the Portuguese, Dutch, English, French, and Danes
all followed in precisely the same spirit of exclusion and injustice.

[From an anthropological viewpoint, [such discoveries of non-European
peoples no doubt played a role in Europeans\' changing conceptions of
humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}. From Herodotus onward, of course, [travel
narratives played a central role in contemplating what it might mean to
be, in some fundamental sense, a human being. Given that theorizations
of human nature relate, in complicated ways, to changing understandings
of the range and characteristics of human societies, institutions, and
practices, the European discovery of 'new' lands and peoples accordingly
generated further, and at times more complex, theorizations of
humanity]{.underline}.20 Moreover, from the sixteenth century onward,
thinkers were particularly keen to consult and appropriate the latest
ethnographic reports. In part, the heightened interest \[END PAGE 348\]
no doubt complemented, and may in part have resulted from, what is often
described as the intellectual revolution in \'natural philosophy\' and
the resulting emphasis on experimentation, empirical study, and
inductive reasoning in fields such as astronomy, but also (especially
from the mid-seventeenth century onward) in the study of human anatomy,
physiology, and psychology. Although many of Hume\'s contemporaries did
not share his hope of introducing \"the experimental method\" to moral
philosophy, there was nonetheless a widespread presumption that an
understanding of the human condition needed to take account, in some
manner, of the growing anthropological literature that detailed the vast
range of human experiences, customs, and practices throughout the
globe.21 This turn toward what Georges Gusdorf has called 'human
science', however, requires a stable referent for what counts as
\'human\' while also upsetting the stability of the term by focusing
attention increasingly on human difference.22 In this sense, the attempt
at identifying the most salient features of humanity was often an
erratic and inherently conflicted task, as John Locke argued it would
have to be, given the very nature of our self-knowledge.

### AT: Can't Redefine/Reclaim the Human

#### The human category [can]{.underline} be reclaimed---their [overly theoretical]{.underline} insistence otherwise ignores [empirical examples]{.underline}.

and Marine Xenology, or, Racism and the Problem of Critique at Sea
Level," Antipode, Volume 50, Issue 1, January 2018, 3-22, dml)

Perhaps [the basic philosophical kernel]{.underline} to be extracted
from this [is **not**]{.underline} the old Levinasian lesson [about how
a primal relation with alterity **precedes ontology**, but rather that
we may, **much more than we usually concede**, opt to **choose** whether
we perceive the vital, vulnerable cargo of this and other wrecked boats
as **human** rather than as **infrahuman**]{.underline}. Though the idea
of choice does not apply to what **[Deligiorgis]{.underline}** called
instinctive actions, he [spontaneously recognized those Eritrean and
Syrian people as **imperilled fellow human beings** rather than as
**infrahumans** or **cockroaches**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} banal example [can be part of the **wider struggle**
to endow a sense of **reciprocal humanity** in]{.underline} Europe's
[**proliferating encounters** with vulnerable otherness]{.underline}.
More is indeed being recovered from the waves than wreckage and corpses.
Europe's relationship with its own shrinking civilization is at stake in
the decision to intervene as well as in the later lives of the
survivors.

The same lesson about the rhetoric of humanity and [the need for **new
humanisms** can be learned when we]{.underline} turn away from the
horrors of the Mediterranean frontier to [consider other instances in
which the issues of humanity and alterity have been **refigured** by
bold, generous acts of solidarity]{.underline}. They might also be
considered to have a philosophical significance discernible outside of
nationality, ethnicity, faith or racial hierarchy. [The recent reports
of **hotel staff spontaneously acting as human shields** to protect
tourists during the terrorist attacks in Tunisia and the endless reports
of **selfless generosity from the Parisian club Bataclan** open up that
possibility]{.underline}. It appears that [the **creative
re-enchantment** of the human]{.underline}, implicitly proposed here in
abstract terms, [is **already underway** as part of convivial
interaction in everyday, heterocultural life]{.underline}. Taken
together, [these examples can provide a **rare opportunity** to enrich
our understanding]{.underline} of the changes that characterize Europe's
postcolonial world. But there is even more than that at stake. Stories
like these supply a valuable means to help us find out which differences
will be different enough to matter in a neoliberal era that is
emphatically "diverse" and indulges its voracious appetite for the
exotic in inverse proportion to the ebbing of Europe's democracies and
their histories of cosmopolitan hope.

[Perhaps the places]{.underline} in Europe [that have]{.underline}
lately [declared themselves to be **cities of sanctuary**]{.underline},
[can inspire us. There have been moves afoot in many towns and cities
---for civil society organizations to **pressurize** but also to
**bypass** government power, opposing racism and xenophobia in order to
build a **culture of hospitality** and **supportive**, **independent**,
**vernacular connections** with fugitives, incomers and settlers via the
work of dedicated non-governmental bodies like Refugee Support as well
as less formal and more fluid local coalitions and activist
bodies]{.underline}. The criminalization of their solidary activities is
already underway. [How **substantial** and **resilient** those
oppositional commitments might be is **firmly in our
hands**]{.underline}.
