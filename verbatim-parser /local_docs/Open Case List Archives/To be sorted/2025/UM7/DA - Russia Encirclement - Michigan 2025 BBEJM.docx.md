# Neg\-\--DA\-\--Encirclement

## Notes

This file is designed to be read against affirmatives that would deploy
strategies of deterrence or encirclement in the Arctic in order to
respond to Russian threats in the area. The link arguments are
relatively narrow toward affirmatives that either deploy the military
unilaterally or seek resources for energy dominance/military dominance
via extraction. The argument relies on the fact that cooperation is a
better form of interacting with Russia in the Arctic. Some of the
impacts presented in the file argue that cooperation is good while
others argue that encirclement is bad.

We will also be releasing a separate CP file that is designed to
function as a uniqueness CP for increasing cooperation, but also perhaps
solve portions of the affirmative if the negative wins that cooperation
is a preferable strategy for interacting with Russia in the Arctic. That
file will include a lot of the cooperation good impacts, which means
that the impacts in this file are a bit more focused on
encirclement/deterrence bad.

[[signal]{.underline}]{.mark} a possible negotiation for peace in
Ukraine and **[[new opportuniti]{.underline}]{.mark}**es
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the countries' relations, including in the
[[Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Arctic, warming four times faster than the rest of the world, may be
the **[[key region]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[US]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} to advance
[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. US-Russia rapprochement may broadly
benefit the world by bringing an [[end]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
**[[disastrous war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} and [reducing]{.mark} the [[risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, but existential environmental issues still
demand attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, [[CEO of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**ussian **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**irect
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nvestment
**[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**und, [named[ the region
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential [[setting for]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "We need to pursue
joint projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic
region makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the [[two
sides]{.underline}]{.mark} have
**[[explicitly expressed interest]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} exploring [[cooperation in energy, investment,
and geopolitic]{.underline}]{.mark}al issues. Western sanctions on
Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with
China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. [[US
officials]{.underline}]{.mark} now [see[ Arctic cooperation
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a potential means to **[["drive a
wedge"]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between Moscow and
Beijing.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian diplomats and
businessmen over the past few weeks, **[[it is
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[many are interested
in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[diverse forms]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark},
from cultural diplomacy that celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous
peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait, to
[[sci]{.underline}]{.mark}entific [[dip]{.underline}]{.mark}lomacy
to understand and adapt to [[climate hazards]{.underline}]{.mark} faced
by both nations. [[Business interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, are
at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources
and reduce the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that
rare earth minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview.
Greenland has large deposits of rare earth elements and is
strategically positioned alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore
oil deposits. Putin's offer to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint
exploration with the US may also have implications for Arctic
cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the Arctic. By
making it easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries,
Americans and Russians will again be able to [conduct[ joint research,
expeditions, and sci]{.underline}]{.mark}entific
[[conferences]{.underline}]{.mark} and build models to **[[better
understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** the unfolding
**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** emergency. Scientific cooperation to
understand the changes [[affecting]{.underline}]{.mark} [[sea ice,
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}, ecosystems, and local communities has
been blunted by the political fallout of the war in Ukraine.

Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional stability. More
importantly, Arctic [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} will **[[build
trust]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[US and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that could complement or **[[spill
over]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[into]{.underline}]{.mark} other crucial
fields of cooperation such as [[arms control, Middle East peace, and
global health.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Increased [military presence]{.underline} leads to Russian [vulnerability]{.underline}.

**Boulegue 24** \[Mathieu; October 31; Senior Fellow with the

Ukraine,"

samar

The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 did not alter
Russia's Arctic military posture. If anything, [Moscow's **obsessive
search** for complete **control**]{.underline} over the Arctic Zone of
the Russian Federation (AZRF) [has been **vindicated** by wider
**geopolitical developments**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [**Finland's**
and **Sweden's** accession to **NATO** is making Russia feel more
**vulnerable**]{.underline} from a military point of view.

[This]{.underline} self-perception of vulnerability [will **inform** how
Russia **projects itself** in the region]{.underline}, [especially
through **low intensity warfare operations**]{.underline} against NATO
and its allies -- [which in turn **raises the risk** of
**miscalculation** and **escalation**]{.underline} in a changing Arctic.

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

From Moscow's viewpoint, [the perceived '**enlargement**' of
NATO]{.underline} to Finland and Sweden [is **fueling** both a sense of
**vindication** and **vulnerability**]{.underline} across the AZRF --
geographically extending from the North Atlantic and the European High
North, to North Pole approaches in the Central Arctic, to the North
Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, [Russia's self-inflicted fear of
'encirclement']{.underline}1) by the Atlantic Alliance has been
validated by Finland and Sweden joining NATO. The double accession
[represents a **fait accompli** for the Kremlin]{.underline}, [honed by
a **self-reinforcing propagandistic narrative** that the Alliance is
turning the **Arctic** into a '**conflict zone**']{.underline}2) or that
there is a 'new Cold War'3) in the region because of Western policy.

This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in 2022 and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force'4) or 'inviting confrontation'5) in the
Arctic.

Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further fuels the Russian logic
that [the **non-Russian Arctic** has become '**NATO
territory**']{.underline}. This ends up [creating a 'NATO 7 vs.
Russia']{.underline}6) [approach]{.underline}, [which tends to
**securitize Arctic affairs**]{.underline} and shape discussions
increasingly in military terms. The policy consequences are that [Moscow
is planning]{.underline} more than ever [for]{.underline} all
contingencies, including [**open military confrontation** in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, [the impact of the **war** has led
**Moscow** to feel **vulnerable**]{.underline} in the Arctic. This
vulnerability is strategic (with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and
military, especially with regards to the impact of climate change and
receding sea ice across the AZRF.

The Russian leadership fears that [a more **accessible** Arctic will
bring along **more military activity** from **NATO** and its
allies]{.underline} in the European Arctic and above North Pole
approaches. [It also fears there will be more military presence from the
**US** and **Canada**]{.underline} in the Pacific Arctic -- alongside
Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and presence.

[The July 2024 Ukrainian **drone strike**]{.underline}7) on the Olenya
air base in the northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic bombers are
stationed, also [**reinforces** their sense of
**vulnerability**]{.underline} -- not least [by **defying** the genuine
**effectiveness** of]{.underline} Russian regional [air
defense]{.underline} capabilities.

Ultimately, [Moscow **does not** want to be **dispossessed** of its
**control** over the AZRF]{.underline}. [The fact that NATO's direct
borders with Russia]{.underline} have increased in size in the Arctic
and Baltic theaters [will undoubtedly **push** the **Kremlin** to
**adapt** its **force projection**]{.underline}.

#### It [escalates]{.underline} grey zones AND [linearly increases]{.underline} the risk of miscalc.

Russia's low intensity warfare operations in the Arctic

[As]{.underline} a [[response]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**sense of [vulnerability]{.mark}** in the AZRF]{.underline},
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[becom]{.mark}ing **more
[confrontational]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} its approach
towards [regional security]{.underline} and [[finding **excuses** to
'**defend'** itself]{.mark} against perceived external
threats]{.underline}. While the Kremlin is taking stock of the
consequences of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, [Russia]{.underline}
[will likely [conduct]{.mark} more **[conventional power
demonstrations]{.mark}**, sub-threshold activities, [and **grey zone
operations**]{.mark} **[in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

While there [is little incentive for the Kremlin leadership to escalate
in the region per]{.underline} [se]{.underline}, there is also a strong
[willingness to continue probing and testing the resolve of the
Arctic]{.underline} 7 through a well-established toolkit of low
intensity warfare operations. These sub-threshold operations and grey
zone activities mostly take the form of:

Brinkmanship-prone activities12) through offensive peacetime maneuvers
at sea and in the air, especially close to the air defense
identification zones (ADIZ) of NATO countries and NORAD, 

Regular snap military exercises, strategic bomber overflights and patrol
activities, and the weaponization of notices to air missions13)(NOTAM)
in the Barents Sea, across North Pole approaches, and close to the
Bering Strait and Alaska -- including with China14),

Seabed warfare activities15), and [notably the disruption of critical
undersea infrastructure]{.underline} (CUI) such as energy pipelines and
fiber optic data cables across Arctic chokepoints,

GNSS/GPS jamming and recurrent electronic warfare operations16) in
Lapland and Finnmark in the European High North -- with severe risks for
civilian and commercial assets.

Risks of miscalculation

A [more **[vulnerable]{.mark}** yet assertive [Russia in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, coupled with more NATO attention towards
the region, [can only [mean]{.mark} that the **[risk of
miscalculation]{.mark}** provoked by civilian and military accidents,
incidents, and tactical errors will **[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Because of the absence of clear lines of communication and deconfliction
between Russia and the Arctic 7 countries, it could [lead to
**[unintended escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and further down the
road, to [**military tension** if not conflict]{.underline}.

\*RDIF: Russian Direct Investment Fund

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once famously said, "Start small, think
big." To some extent, that sentiment applied to the agenda of the
[US-Russia]{.underline}n [talks]{.underline} [in]{.underline} Riyadh in
[March]{.underline}, where the parties **[unexpectedly
revived]{.underline}** the [Arctic]{.underline} as a region for possible
economic [cooperation]{.underline}. Given the war in Ukraine and other
fundamental disagreements, such a scenario, beyond symbolic gestures,
seems unlikely. Nevertheless, [Moscow and Washington]{.underline} seem
**[intent]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} **[sustaining]{.underline}**
the trend of normalising **[relations]{.underline}**---and for this
reason, one can begin to dream.

The Arctic and the North Pole did not arise by chance. It is clear that
American and Russian negotiators initially sought to separate overall
bilateral ties from the war in Ukraine. It is therefore no coincidence
that Russian President Vladimir Putin included Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of
the **[R]{.underline}**ussian **[D]{.underline}**irect
**[I]{.underline}**nvestment **[F]{.underline}**und, in the negotiating
team. His task was to energetically and clearly [explain]{.underline}
the [benefits of]{.underline} **[restoring]{.underline}** investment and
economic **[cooperation]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} a
business-minded Donald [Trump]{.underline}.

Moscow's emphasis on potential [collaboration in]{.underline} the
[Arctic]{.underline} seems logical, given the US president's assertive
desire to gain control of Greenland and limit China's activities in the
region. There have, after all, been positive examples of cooperation in
the past, including joint ventures between Russia's Rosneft and US
companies ExxonMobil and General Electric.

In 2014, collaboration between Rosneft and ExxonMobil led to the
discovery of a field in the Kara Sea with reserves of 130 million tonnes
of oil and 422 billion cubic metres of gas. However, the exploration was
affected by Western sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014, leading to
ExxonMobil's withdrawal from the project.

Kremlin chose to publicly develop this theme during Putin's visit to
Murmansk, which was timed to coincide with US Vice President JD Vance's
visit to Greenland. During his participation in the 'Arctic: Territory
of Dialogue' forum, the **[Russian president]{.underline}** [called
for]{.underline} [cooperation with]{.underline} the [US in]{.underline}
the [Arctic]{.underline} and effectively voiced support for Washington's
claims to Greenland. He also pointed out that the question of Greenland
had nothing to do with Russia, while expressing concern that NATO
countries consider the North Pole a possible conflict zone. In
particular, the alliance's newest recruits, Finland and Sweden, have
been involved in military exercises in the territory.

At the same forum, Dmitriev announced Russia's plan to create a special
investment fund for Arctic development by the end of the year. This
fund, he claimed, would attract capital from partners in the GCC and "a
number of Western countries". He also noted the US has shown interest in
investing in Russia's Arctic region, including LNG projects.

On the one hand, [the Kremlin's exploitation of the Arctic can be viewed
within the]{.underline} framework of Russia's **[diplomatic
approach]{.underline}** to the current US administration[. Moscow is
ready to throw decorative minor concessions to Trump]{.underline} in
order to prevent fundamental disagreements over Ukraine from interfering
with the restoration of bilateral relations.

Economic insecurity

[The]{.underline} second [[**insecurity** shaping **Russia's Arctic
policy** is]{.underline}]{.mark} over [[the]{.mark} perceived
[**threat** to its ability to]{.mark}]{.underline} safely and
effectively [[**extract oil** and **gas**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Russian
officials]{.underline} frequently [cite that around [80%]{.mark} of the
country's **natural gas** and 17% of its **oil reserves** [are
located]{.mark} with[**in** the]{.mark} **Russian [Arctic]{.mark}
zone**]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has]{.underline} even [dubbed the
Arctic as its]{.underline} "[**resource base** of the 21st
century]{.underline}". However, over two-thirds of these
reserves---particularly those located offshore---are hard-to-cover and
inaccessible due to technological limitations. At the same time, fields
with more accessible extraction---mostly located in other regions of
Russia---are gradually being depleted.

[For a [country]{.mark} that [relies on **oil** and **gas** for **20%**
of its **GDP**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[this is]{.underline}]{.mark} an
**[[existential]{.underline}]{.mark}** issue. In response, Russian state
companies actively sought partnerships with international firms to
develop Arctic projects---fully aware of their dependence on foreign
technology and despite tightening regulations on foreign investment in
the Arctic. One frequently highlighted success story was the cooperation
between Rosneft and ExxonMobil in the Kara Sea, which gave Russia access
to technologies for deepwater drilling. This collaboration was widely
publicised in Russia, along with Putin's personal involvement, as a
major strategic win.

That trajectory changed dramatically in 2014 when [[the **US** and the
**EU** imposed **sanctions**]{.mark} on Russia after its illegal
**annexation of Crimea**]{.underline}. These included restrictions on
the export of technologies and equipment critical for Arctic resource
development, effectively stopping or delaying parts of Russian Arctic
projects and shutting down joint ventures like the one with ExxonMobil.
The [**sanctions** were [a]{.mark} **targeted [blow]{.mark}** to
**[Russia]{.mark}**'s ability to develop **energy
reserves**]{.underline}, [a move]{.underline} which [the Kremlin [saw
as]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[clearly [aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline}**".
In the aftermath, [a sense of [**strategic vulnerability** and
**paranoia** intensified among **Russian
officials**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [built on the **idea** that the West
is pursuing a policy of taking Russia's **natural
resources**]{.underline}.

Having a meltdown

[The [Kremlin's]{.mark} **growing [insecurities]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}
Russia's military and [**resource** capabilities have **deepened
significantly** since]{.mark} the invasion of
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[accession of **Finland** and
**Sweden**]{.mark} to NATO has [left Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
effectively "**[[encircled]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [by the
**alliance**'s members]{.underline} in the Arctic. [This
[intensified]{.mark} its feelings of
**[vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as did the 2022 sabotage of the
Nord Stream pipelines. Although Russia had already halted gas deliveries
through the pipelines, the attack exposed its inability to secure
critical infrastructure in the Baltic Sea. In 2024, a successful
Ukrainian drone strike on the Olenya airbase---located above the Arctic
Circle and home to Russia's strategic bomber aircraft---dealt another
blow to Kremlin confidence.

In parallel, Western sanctions targeting Russia's Arctic projects have
intensified since 2022, with the 17th EU package adopted in May 2025.
[They have]{.underline} largely [focused on a **deep insecurity** for
Russia]{.underline}: [liquefied natural gas]{.underline}
(**[LNG]{.underline}**). But [[the Kremlin has little room for
**manoeuvre**]{.mark} against these measures]{.underline}. It has
promoted projects like Arctic LNG 2 as replacements for lost pipeline
gas exports to Europe. But Western countries have imposed successive
sanctions aimed at undermining the project's viability including
blacklisting the operating company, restricting access to LNG ice-class
tankers and targeting tanker operators. As a result, despite reported
efforts by Russia to circumvent some of these restrictions on Western
equipment, the timeline for Arctic LNG 2 has repeatedly been delayed.

[These [events]{.mark} have [**hastened** the **security dilemma** in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russian [officials]{.mark} now
[interpret]{.mark} **nearly [all NATO activity]{.mark}** [in the region
as **threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and a]{.underline}]{.mark}
"potential **[[prelude to direct confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
while [they widely perceive [America's **Arctic** strategy]{.mark} as
overtly]{.underline} "**[[confrontational]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and
Western sanctions as a targeted offensive.

world order where [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[prevails]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[over
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why Were Diplomatic Relations Broken?

The diplomatic rupture between Washington and Moscow began in 2016 with
U.S. accusations of Russian interference in the presidential elections.
Tensions escalated further in 2018 when the U.S. expelled Russian
diplomats over allegations of poisoning a former Russian intelligence
officer in the United Kingdom. However, the breaking point came in 2022,
after the start of Russia\'s special military operation in Ukraine. In
response, the United States imposed harsh sanctions, expelled Russian
envoys, and restricted the operations of Russian diplomatic missions.
These measures triggered reciprocal actions from Moscow, leaving both
embassies understaffed and bilateral relations at an all-time low.

Negative Impacts of Severed Diplomatic Ties

The deterioration of U.S.-Russia relations had severe consequences,
affecting not just the two nations but the entire global community:

Lack of Communication: With diplomatic missions largely inoperative,
direct dialogue between the two nuclear powers was nearly impossible,
increasing the risk of miscalculations and conflicts.

Geopolitical Fragmentation: The hostility between the U.S. and Russia
deepened global divisions, particularly in Europe, where the conflict in
Ukraine disrupted political and economic stability.

Economic Consequences: Trade restrictions and sanctions significantly
affected global markets, particularly in energy and agriculture, leading
to inflation and supply chain disruptions.

Military Escalation: The absence of direct negotiations fueled military
confrontations in Ukraine, increasing the human and financial costs.

Global Security Concerns: The lack of U.S.-Russia engagement exacerbated
conflicts in Syria, the Arctic, and other strategic regions, affecting
global security frameworks.

The Benefits of Restoring Diplomatic Relations

With the agreement fully restoring diplomatic functions, a new chapter
in U.S.-Russia relations has begun. This move carries significant
benefits:

**[[End]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing the [[Ukraine
Conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} on Russian Terms: The Riyadh [[talks
indicate]{.underline}]{.mark} a shift toward a **[[realistic
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. With President Trump
prioritizing diplomacy over prolonged military engagement, the conflict
is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to Russia. This means
Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial gains will be
acknowledged.

Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a reduced
commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish. This
shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting Western
military presence near its borders.

Economic Revival: The resumption of diplomatic ties is expected to lead
to the [[lift]{.underline}]{.mark}ing of
[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing Russia to reintegrate into
global trade networks. This will [[benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[energy markets]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[stabilize]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[commodity
prices]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [[foster]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[econ]{.underline}]{.mark}**omic [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Enhanced Strategic Cooperation: The United States and Russia have common
interests in counterterrorism, space exploration, and Arctic
development. Renewed diplomacy paves the way for collaborative projects
in these areas.

Middle East Stability: Russia and the U.S. working together could lead
to improved security in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's role in hosting
the talks highlights the importance of multilateral diplomacy in
resolving international conflicts.

Global Peace and Order: A stable U.S.-Russia relationship reduces the
likelihood of new conflicts, creating a more predictable and balanced
world order.

during high-level talks in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} The Russian

fundamentally challenges the post-2022 Arctic order, where NATO has
become the primary vehicle for regional cooperation following the
suspension of the Arctic Council. [The [focus on joint energy projects
suggests]{.mark} a potential [weakening of Western economic
sanctions]{.mark} and isolation of Russia in the Arctic.]{.underline}
This bilateral approach raises serious concerns about the future of
Arctic governance -- while the US and Russia might benefit from direct
energy cooperation, excluding other Arctic states risks fragmenting
regional coordination at a time when unified approaches to Arctic
challenges are most needed. [The [discussions]{.mark} also
[indicate]{.mark} a significant [realignment of US Arctic policy, moving

[[Trump's]{.mark} talk of taking over the Panama Canal, [making
Canada]{.mark} the [51st state and getting Greenland]{.mark} "one way or
another" appears to be [rupturing]{.mark} the [post-World War II order
in favor of a world without constraints on territorial expansion]{.mark}
by force --- and one [closer to]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[Putin's]{.mark} view.]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark} "is [ideologically closer to Putin than]{.mark}, say, to
\[French President Emmanuel\] [Macron]{.mark},"]{.underline} Vladislav
Surkov, a former deputy premier who helped neuter Russia's democracy and
engineer the invasions of Crimea and eastern Ukraine in 2014, told
French magazine L'Express.

[[Peace negotiations]{.mark}, he said, will [deliver Russia's goal:
Ukraine's defeat]{.mark} through either war or diplomacy, and its
partition "into natural parts."]{.underline} The Russian world, he
continued, has no borders and "we will expand in all directions, as God
wills, and as far as our resources allow."

[[Trump's policy]{.mark} is ["beneficial to
Russia,"]{.mark}]{.underline} analyst Mikhail Yemelyanov wrote in the
newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "Trump is ready to make serious
concessions to Russia without demanding reciprocal steps." The
multipolar world "has already arrived. And Trump is already living in
it," he added.

[Here are the [major shifts by]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration
that [benefit Russia]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[[Concessions on Ukraine peace talks]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Even before peace talks began, the [Trump]{.mark} administration
[publicly rejected key demands from Kyiv, including NATO membership and
keeping conquered Ukrainian territory on the negotiating
table.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In contentious comments that suggested tacit U.S. acceptance that Russia
has legitimate claims on Ukrainian territory, Trump special envoy Steve
Witkoff said five regions annexed by Moscow were part of Russia, and
["[this has always been the issue." Russia]{.mark}, he said, has
["reclaimed them."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Witkoff claimed that annexation referendums were proof that an
"overwhelming majority" in the regions "want to be under Russian rule,"
although the U.N. General Assembly in 2022 deplored Russia's "attempted
annexation of Ukrainian land as blatant disregard for the bedrock
principles on which the Organization was founded."

[[Trump's negotiators]{.mark} have also [promised economic deals with
Russia once a peace deal is signed]{.mark} --- a major goal for Putin
that would [help restore Russia's economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[As peace talks continue, [several U.S. national security
agencies]{.mark} have [stopped work countering Russian sabotage,
disinformation and cyberattacks]{.mark}. The U.S. [Cyber Command was
ordered to halt planning of offensive cyber operations against
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It is not clear whether these
measures were temporary confidence-building measures during peace talks
or a permanent change.

Recent partial-ceasefire talks for the Black Sea may grant Russia
reentry into the SWIFT system for global money transfers under the guise
of selling grain --- long a desire of Putin's government.

#### Trump backs Putin and trusts him -- spilling over to assistance in actions such as Russian Arctic gas exploitation.

[[Putin, a trustworthy friend]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Under Trump]{.mark}, [Putin]{.mark} is [no longer seen as an
unpredictable adversary bent on ending U.S. global hegemony, but]{.mark}
a smart, gracious and likable [friend who]{.mark}, according to Witkoff,
[won't take any more Ukrainian territory or attack Europe]{.mark} in the
future.]{.underline}

"First of all, why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose,
exactly? [[They don't need to absorb Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}," he
said, despite the fact that Russia has used political interference and
military aggression to attempt to subjugate Ukraine throughout Putin's
25-year rule.

[["I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me," Witkoff
said]{.underline}]{.mark} in an interview aired Friday. "I don't regard
Putin as a bad guy."

[With that, [Putin]{.mark} has [shed]{.mark} his [pariah status in
Washington]{.mark} to be [restored]{.mark} as [a global leader]{.mark}
who can help [bring stability to the Middle East or partner with the
United States to **export Russian Arctic gas** to
Europe.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark}, meanwhile, has [accused Kyiv of starting the
war]{.mark} and [called Ukrainian]{.mark} President Volodymyr Zelensky
[a dictator]{.mark} --- echoing Putin's own claims.]{.underline}

[[Despite Russia\'s harmful]{.mark} national [interests against]{.mark}
the [U.S.,]{.mark} and its human rights violations around the world,
President [Trump]{.mark} and his team are [directly]{.mark} and
indirectly [tied to Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Throughout the 2016 presidential election, President [Trump]{.mark} not
only [refused to criticize]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}, but [was]{.mark} even [friendly and
accommodating]{.mark} in his remarks. In his own words, President [Trump
called]{.mark} President [Putin \"highly respected.\"]{.mark} More
recently, President [Trump]{.mark} put the U.S. on equal moral footing
with Russia when [responding to]{.mark} Bill O\'Reilly\'s [question
about Putin being a \"killer,\"]{.mark} saying [\"We\'ve got a lot of
killers\... you think our country\'s so innocent?\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
This is absolutely false moral equivalence, and unheard of for the
President of the United States to insult and demean the country he
leads.

President Trump has harshly criticized NATO, and exclaimed that only the
NATO allies that paid equally to the alliance deserved protection from
the United States. Though these remarks were softened by British Prime
Minister Theresa May, who claims that President Trump fully supports the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), [it\'s still [unclear how
supportive he will be of NATO]{.mark} allies like the Baltic states [in
light of his relationship with Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[President [Trump]{.mark} has also [surrounded himself with people who
do business with]{.mark} and are sympathetic to [Russia]{.mark}. The New
York Times reported that [members of Trump\'s 2016 campaign]{.mark} and
other Trump associates had [frequent contact with senior Russian
intelligence officials]{.mark} throughout the campaign.]{.underline} In
addition to these questionable communications, here are a few other
associates with ties to Moscow.

#### The Trump administration is making cuts to important US organizations -- USAID, RFE/RL, and Voice of America -- because Russia perceives them as threats.

Cuts to U.S. soft power

[For years, the [Kremlin]{.mark} has bitterly [opposed]{.mark} the U.S.
Agency for International Development ([USAID]{.mark}), Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty ([RFE/RL) and Voice of America]{.mark}. The
[Trump]{.mark} administration is now working to [eliminate]{.mark} all
of them [or slash]{.mark} their [funding and staff.]{.mark} The
[organizations]{.mark} have been [major tools of American soft power,
promoting democratic values, countering autocrats, presenting accurate
reporting in regions where news is censored, and helping vulnerable
populations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2017, [[Moscow designated RFE/RL as a foreign
agent,]{.underline}]{.mark} slapping fines on the organization and
eventually forcing its operations in Russia into bankruptcy. The
organization left the country in 2022 but continued to report on it.
[[In 2024, Russia designated it as an "undesirable
organization,"]{.underline}]{.mark} meaning anyone who worked for
RFE/RL, was interviewed by it, donated to it or posted its content could
face criminal charges.

[An [RFE/RL editor]{.mark}, Alsu Kurmasheva, was [arrested in 2023 and
jailed]{.mark}]{.underline}, convicted of spreading false news about the
war in Ukraine. She was freed last year as part of a prisoner exchange.

Despite the harassment, RFE/RL continued to report, but [[Trump's
decision to eliminate it may succeed where the Kremlin
failed.]{.underline}]{.mark} RFE/RL has taken legal action against
funding cuts, as have Voice of America and USAID employees.

[[Russian]{.mark} Foreign Ministry [spokeswoman]{.mark} Maria Zakharova
[attacked USAID]{.mark} last month, [saying U.S. tools of soft power
were used "to keep afloat the painful and perverted narratives of
American ultraliberals."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[She said USAID posed "more risks than aid" and vowed that
[Russia]{.mark} would [continue "to suppress outside attempts to
undermine stability and security in our common space under the pretext
of alleged concern for democracy."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Many small independent Russian and Ukrainian media outlets
were supported by USAID funding.

#### Trump and Putin are cooperating now, weakening the capabilities of other countries and allies.

Tensions with allies

England, in 2019. (Peter Nicholls/AP)

[One of [Putin's key strategic goals]{.mark} during his quarter-century
in power has been to [weaken NATO and divide the U.S. from
Europe,]{.mark} but [Trump]{.mark} seems to have [hit]{.mark} the
[fast-forward button.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark} has upended decades of U.S. foreign policy by
[pivot]{.mark}ing t[o closer relations with Russia]{.mark}, while
threatening NATO allies and pausing military aid and intelligence
cooperation with Ukraine.]{.underline}

Trump, who said the E.U. was "formed to screw the United States," has
also threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Europe.

[According to former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, [Trump
almost withdrew from NATO in 2018]{.mark}. Trump has [threatened not to
defend NATO allies that don't meet]{.mark} a target of spending [2
percent of their g]{.mark}ross [d]{.mark}omestic [p]{.mark}roduct on
defense, and in January he said the [target]{.mark} should be [raised to
5 percent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The administration's chill toward Europe was laid bare when Vice
President JD [[Vance scolded European leaders at the Munich Security
Conference last month]{.mark},]{.underline} calling on Europe to "step
up in a big way to provide for its own defense."

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned NATO defense ministers last month
that they couldn't assume U.S. forces would stay in Europe forever, with
Washington no longer primarily focused on European security, [leaving
[NATO allies wonder]{.mark}ing [if Trump could pull out troops from
Europe in coming years. **One of Putin's avowed goals has been to roll
back NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The apparent hostility of Vance and Hegseth toward Europe surfaced in a
group chat on Signal by U.S. security officials that accidentally
included a journalist from the Atlantic.

In the chat, which discussed military planning for a U.S. assault on
Houthi militants in Yemen, an official believed to be Vance opposed the
strikes because Houthi attacks in the Red Sea most affect European
shipping, posting, "I just hate bailing Europe out again." An official
believed to be Hegseth responded, "VP, I fully share your loathing of
European freeloading. It's PATHETIC."

### UQ\-\--Energy Coop\-\--2NC

#### Energy cooperation happening now\-\--predictive

**Ilyushina '25** \[Mary; March 31; Reporter on the Foreign Desk of The
Washington Post; Washington Post, "Lure of the north: What Russia's
Arctic can offer Trump,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/31/russia-arctic-gas-minerals-trump-putin/\]
samar

Russia, which saw an opening in Trump's business-first approach, swooped
into renewed talks with U.S. delegations with business proposals,
offering access to the country's mineral reserves and joint ventures in
the Arctic.

"[The **Arctic** is too **important** for Cold War-style
politics]{.underline}. Russia & the U.S. must find common ground to
ensure stability, resource development & environmental protection,"
Putin's business envoy in U.S. negotiations, Kirill Dmitriev, recently
said on X.

At the Arctic Forum in Murmansk last week, [Dmitriev announced that
**Russia** would set up a **special investment fund** for Arctic
**development** by]{.underline} year's end that would attract funds from
partners in the Persian Gulf as well as "[a number of **Western
countries**]{.underline}." Dmitriev also said [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [showed "**interest**"
in **investing** in the **Russian** Arctic region]{.underline},
including in LNG projects.

For Trump, **[expansion]{.underline}** in the Arctic [can be a way to
**resell** cheap **energy** or buy **minerals** and rare earth
**metals** from Russia]{.underline}, experts said. Cooperation with
Russia would also be a way to stave off the growing interest of China,
which has declared itself "a near-Arctic state," and is building its own
icebreaking fleet to explore the emerging trade routes.

For Russia, [this presents an **opportunity** to **access** the **LNG**
tech]{.underline}nologies it lacks [and **revive** some of its key
**revenue makers**]{.underline}, [which have been hindered by
**sanctions**]{.underline} since the invasion of Ukraine.

"When it comes to Arctic, [Russia has a lot to offer]{.underline}," said
Russian economist and Arctic expert Vladislav Inozemtsev. "It is also
something Russia cannot fully develop on its own."

All about the gas

A warming climate has unlocked economic opportunities along the Northern
Sea Route, a faster trade lane between Europe and Asia that was once
frozen, and Russia aims to capitalize on this with its unrivaled
icebreaker fleet.

These Arctic regions are rich in massive deposits of natural gas, with
the Bovanenkovo field on the Yamal Peninsula alone holding approximately
4.9 trillion cubic meters of gas reserves, rivaling major U.S. fields
such as Eagle Ford Shale. Russia had invested millions in LNG facilities
along the northern route --- until Western sanctions derailed those
plans.

In 2019, Russia aimed for 30 percent to 40 percent control of the global
LNG market and hoped to boost production to 70 million tons by 2030.

But [Russia's **LNG** industry is **heavily reliant** on **Western
tech**nology and equipment]{.underline}, and it was crippled by the
post-invasion sanctions. By 2024, Russia still had only an 8 percent
market share.

Echoing Witkoff's idea, Inozemtsev suggested that [**Trump** could
**strike a deal** with Russia by letting the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [have a **stake** in developing the **LNG**
projects]{.underline} in Russia and then giving them a share of gas to
resell to third countries.

One possible arrangement could see the United States acting as an
intermediary for Russian gas sales to Europe, which after the Ukraine
invasion largely weaned itself off Russian gas.

In this scenario, Inozemtsev said, [Trump could **push Europe** to
**restart** Russian pipeline gas **imports**]{.underline}, while Moscow,
in return, would compensate the United States with a share of the Arctic
liquefied gas that it could then ship to other countries at a higher
profit margin.

"[Russia has **lucrative things** to offer to the U.S.]{.underline},
should the U.S., in turn, put pressure on Europe," Inozemtsev said. The
United States could fulfill its gas contracts to Europe by selling them
reflagged Russian gas from the pipeline network and then sell its own
LNG elsewhere.

There have also been reports of efforts to restart the Nord Stream
pipeline which once brought gas across the Baltic Sea into Europe.

Pushing Europe to reopen sanctioned pipelines, however, is a hard sell
after the continent's painful breakup with Russian gas and oil after the
invasion. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck dismissed the idea of
reviving Nord Stream, calling it "completely the wrong direction,"
following a recent Financial Times report about another possible effort.
Similar resistance is likely across Europe, as many countries remain
wary of rekindling ties with a supplier that has shown few qualms about
using its resources for political ends.

In addition to gas, [Russia's **Arctic** is filled with **rare-earth
metals** the Trump administration has publicly **expressed interest**
in]{.underline}. At the forum, Dmitriev said the new fund plans to
invest in development "with various partners."

The Arctic is also rich in valuable minerals and metals such as lithium,
nickel and aluminum, key resources for high-tech industries, renewable
energy and defense.

"It's a key thing it can offer beyond just energy extraction," said
Pavel Devyatkin, a Moscow-based senior fellow at the Arctic Institute,
arguing that Moscow sees cooperation with the United States in the
Arctic not from a purely economic standpoint but as a diplomatic tool to
restore ties and global status with fewer geopolitical hurdles.

"[The big thing here is the **narrative** of **Arctic
exceptionalism**]{.underline}," he said, referring to a policy first
proposed by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that suggested the
region should be exempt from geopolitical tensions, "[where
**cooperation** can happen **despite conflicts**]{.underline}."

"[Working together in the Arctic is still important for Russia's great
power status]{.underline}," he said.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

There is also a theory in the U.S. administration that engaging with
Russia, such as in the Arctic, could help it disengage from China, a
goal recently put forward by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Last year,
the Pentagon highlighted in an updated Arctic Strategy the threat posed
by Russia and China joining up in the region. In recent years, the
United States expanded its military readiness in the Arctic in response
to Moscow and Beijing's "growing alignment" in economic and military
cooperation, as the two states held joint military drills in the Bering
Strait between Russia and Alaska. A recent analysis by Rand noted that
Moscow has grown increasingly reliant on Beijing to finance its Arctic
projects. "We could find ourselves in a situation where, whether Russia
wants to improve its relations with the U.S. or not, they can't because
they've become completely dependent on the Chinese because we have cut
them off," Rubio told conservative outlet Breitbart News on Feb. 25.
While Russia recognizes the imbalance in its relations with China and is
working to expand ties with other powers to offset this, it would be
difficult to fully cleave Russia from China, said Alexander Gabuev,
director of the Carnegie Eurasia Center. "At present, the West in
general and Washington in particular cannot offer Moscow anything so
attractive that the Kremlin would agree to disengage from Beijing," he
said. Treacherous waters While Russia likes to promote the Northern Sea
Route as a shorter alternative to the Suez Canal, the passage can be
treacherous. For the largest container ships, many parts of the journey
can be too shallow and the scarcity of ports is an added danger.
Likewise, the journey for American companies into Russian commercial
space can be risky from a regulatory standpoint. The legal terms of any
joint U.S.-Russia enterprises are murky. Moscow has a list of
"unfriendly countries" that essentially act as a tool of reciprocal
sanctions. Putin would have to exclude the United States from the list.
Russia, scorched by the quick exodus of Western companies in the first
weeks of the Ukraine war, signaled that any companies allowed back in
would face new regulations and strictures to keep such an exit from
happening again. "Now we will demand investments not just in papers but
in the land," a senior Kremlin official said on the condition of
anonymity to discuss the matter more freely. "We will demand a situation
that will prevent them further from taking a decision and leaving
everything overnight." Before the war in Ukraine, a handful of foreign
companies were involved in Russia's Arctic energy sector, though
sanctions and geopolitical tensions often restricted their footprint.
The Shtokman gas field was once planned as a major LNG export hub, led
by Gazprom, French Total and Norwegian Equinor. The project stalled
because of high costs and technological challenges. Western sanctions
after the 2014 Crimea annexation further doomed it, and it was
officially shelved.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

[**ExxonMobil** was the most **significant**]{.underline} U.S.
[player]{.underline}, [teaming up with Rosneft in]{.underline} such
[major projects]{.underline} as the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas development.

Other American firms, including [**Halliburton**, **SLB**, and Baker
**Hughes**, played supporting roles]{.underline}, providing technology,
equipment and oil field services to Russian energy giants.

After rounds of sanctions, American energy firms had little choice but
to pack up and sever ties with one of the world's most resource-rich but
politically volatile nations.

This legacy now raises questions about whether the Trump-Putin
rapprochement would be enough to persuade U.S. companies to risk
operating in the market with high interest rates, increasing inflation
and a rule of law that often exists only in theory.

**13%** of the world\'s **[oil]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**30%** of the
natural **[gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**25%** of the
**[coal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} a significant amount of
**[rare minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In December 2023, [the US
unilaterally announced its claims to extend its **continental shelf** in
the Arctic Ocean]{.underline} and other regions. It is widely believed
[that]{.underline} the [move is primarily **driven** by a desire to
access the **rich mineral resources** in the region]{.underline},
[particularly **lithium** for battery manufacturing and **tellurium**
for solar panel production]{.underline}. According to RIA Novosti, [the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [seabed is estimated to contain **resources**
equivalent to **83 billion tons** of standard fuel]{.underline}. [The
[possibility of **discovering** new]{.mark}]{.underline} large-scale
[**oil and gas [reserves]{.mark}** in unexplored continental shelf areas
[is]{.mark} also **[very high]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, the
[**[unilateral pursuit]{.mark}** of its interests by the US
[undermines]{.mark} the [**peace** and **stability**]{.mark} of the
**Arctic** region]{.underline}. Its [[behavior is **detrimental**
to]{.mark} the efforts of [the international community]{.mark} to
**jointly explore** and **utilize Arctic resources** [and
contradicts]{.mark} the trend of **[peace]{.mark}** and
**cooperation**]{.underline}.

[Peace and stability in the Arctic provide a significant guarantee for
all activities in the region]{.underline}. [The US should not bring
**conflict** and **confrontation** into the **Arctic**]{.underline}.
[Militarization and **[confrontational actions]{.mark}** not only fail
to resolve Arctic issues but also **[exacerbate regional
tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, damage the environment, [[and pose
threats to **global security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the only
superpower, [the US should demonstrate its image as a **responsible**
major country in Arctic affairs]{.underline}, rather than the opposite.

"[Everyone wants to **bite** off somewhere or to **bite off** something
from us]{.underline}. But [they should know that we will **knock out**
everyone's teeth so that they **cannot bite**]{.underline}." [This was
the **response**]{.underline} Vladimir [**Putin** gave]{.underline} in
2021 [to American criticism of **Russian naval** and **military
expansion** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. It made clear that [for
Russia]{.underline}, [[the **Arctic** is]{.mark} a region [of
**strategic importance**]{.mark} that [Moscow is **willing to
fight**]{.mark} for [using **any means** necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, [once a **remote** and largely
**untouched** region]{.underline}, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [becoming [a **focal point** of]{.mark} international
interest and **[geopolitical tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course,
struggles for control of the Arctic are nothing new. Historically, [the
region]{.underline} often [mirrored]{.underline} the [strategic
manoeuvring of **superpowers** and minor countries with territorial
claims]{.underline}, thus [making it a **microcosm** of global
**geopolitical dynamics**]{.underline}. The bipolar structure of Arctic
geopolitics dominated by US and Soviet interests during the Cold War
became largely unipolar after the fall of the Soviet Union. [Now [it's
**evolving**]{.mark} further [as **Russia** and **China** become]{.mark}
more **[assertive]{.mark}** in pursuing their
**interests**]{.underline}. Given the extreme climate conditions, the
region may seem unattractive at first sight, but a closer look unveils
its vital importance for modern economies from the 18th century onwards.

Interest in the Arctic goes back at least to the 1730s, when expeditions
by Dutch and English explorers around Spitzberg Island opened the door
to commercial whaling. In the 20th century, [[attention shifted towards
**oil** and **natural gas extraction**]{.mark} as the region proved
**rich in resources** vital for fossil fuel economies]{.underline}.
[That is most striking in the case of **Russia**]{.underline}. [[The
Arctic makes up]{.underline}]{.mark} some [**28 per cent** of the
Russian landmass]{.underline}, and [it's]{.underline} also [where [the
majority of Russian]{.mark} **oil** and **gas [production]{.mark}** is
located]{.underline}. In 2022 alone, "Russia's production of Arctic oil
and gas amounted to some 10.65 million barrels of oil equivalent per
day," according to Statista, making it "the largest producer across the
globe," followed by Norway and the US. But the future of the Arctic lies
elsewhere.

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay there The Arctic warms
approximately three times faster than the global average. This has led
some to assume that the Arctic countries (Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the US) may benefit from climate
change to some degree, as it will make their largely frozen regions more
habitable, if not suitable for agriculture. This idea is especially
popular in Russia, where permafrost covers almost two-thirds of its
territory and whose vast Siberian region faces extreme conditions.
According to this line of thought, Russia could profit from rising
global temperatures and become a "climate winner". But while the
economic potential of thawing may seem promising, much more than
permafrost lies under the fertile soil, including methane, a greenhouse
gas 84 times stronger than carbon dioxide, and the danger of unknown
bacteria and viruses. As climate change accelerates, its impacts on the
Arctic ripple outwards, influencing global weather patterns. Less ice
means less reflected heat to disrupt the polar jet stream that circles
the Arctic region. This can result in heat waves or, conversely, harder
winters. Melting sea ice also affects precipitation patterns around the
northern hemisphere. Even worse, the melting of both sea ice and
Greenland glaciers is changing patterns of ocean currents in the North
Atlantic to such a degree that they may stop altogether. If that
happens, it would cause significant regional cooling, of about 5 to 10
degrees Celsius, in Europe and North America. At the same time, the
melting of Arctic ice accelerates global climate change further, as
detailed by the National Ocean Service: "When warming temperatures
gradually melt sea ice over time, fewer bright surfaces are available to
reflect sunlight into the atmosphere. More solar energy is absorbed at
the surface, and ocean temperatures rise. This begins a cycle of warming
and melting." Thus, global climate change is heavily influencing the
Arctic region and the Arctic is heavily influencing the global climate,
creating a feedback loop. Paradoxically, the Arctic may soon become a
hotspot for mining materials needed to build the green economy. The
invasion of Ukraine spreads into the Arctic. The melting ice and warming
temperatures have reshaped not only the physical landscape of the Arctic
but also the political and economic interests that converge there. This
evolving dynamic mirrors broader shifts in the international order and
intensifying competition for resources and strategic advantages. At the
heart of Arctic governance lies the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental
forum established in 1996 to promote cooperation among the Arctic
states, Indigenous peoples, and other inhabitants on issues of
sustainable development and environmental protection. Although its role
in the Arctic is vital, its mandate does not extend to security issues
(these were purportedly excluded from its mandate right at the very
beginning). But their importance in the region is growing.
Unsurprisingly, given that Russia is a key player in the Arctic, its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had significant
implications for Arctic cooperation. The other seven Arctic states
resorted to unprecedented sanctions that have restricted Russia's
ability to explore, produce, transport and sell oil and gas in the
region. It also resulted in Russia's closer cooperation with China and
growing militarisation of the Arctic that goes hand in hand with the
wider intensification of geopolitical rivalries --- mainly between the
US and Russia, and the US and China. Despite its ongoing war in Ukraine,
Russia is expanding its Northern Fleet and deploying nuclear submarines,
radar stations, airfields and missile facilities. Furthermore, the old
Russian dream of establishing an Arctic route and dominating
international shipping got a significant boost with the disruption of
the Red Sea route by Houthi rebels. However, the northern route may not
be a safe one. Continuous melting of sea ice may well open up new trade
routes in the High North, but it is not yet possible to use these routes
without icebreakers. Even worse, rapid changes in the Arctic climate
cause more extreme weather, and, therefore, more unstable and
challenging conditions for marine transports. Russia's dream may not be
realised anytime soon.

The Arctic green economy

[Evidence that the]{.underline} post-Cold War [**unipolar world order**
is ending is starkly evident in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. [The region
is]{.underline} now [divided into the **NATO Arctic** and the **Russian
Arctic**]{.underline}, [reflecting the broader splitting]{.underline} of
powerful countries [into two]{.underline} alliances or
**[blocs]{.underline}**: NATO, and BRICS, [the latter led by **China**
and **Russia**]{.underline}. [This division may have serious
implications for **security**]{.underline}, environmental policies, a[nd
especially]{.underline}, [future **resource extraction**]{.underline}.
[Despite the possibility that **oil** and **gas extraction** in [the
**Arctic**]{.mark} will eventually become a thing of the
past]{.underline}, [this does not mean that the Arctic will become
unattractive for economic interests]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [it
[may soon become a **hotspot** for **mining materials**]{.mark} needed
to build the **green economy**]{.underline}. A region that has been
exploited primarily for its vast fossil fuel reserves may not find peace
after all.

[The Arctic is believed to contain substantial quantities of **valuable
minerals** and **metals**]{.underline}. [These include **r**are
**e**arth **e**lement**s**]{.underline} (essential for manufacturing
wind turbines or electric vehicle batteries), **[copper]{.underline}**
(critical for electric wiring and renewable energy infrastructure),
[**nickel** and **cobalt**]{.underline} (key components of batteries for
electric vehicles), [and **platinum**-group metals]{.underline} (vital
for catalytic converters and hydrogen fuel cells). So far, European
countries have been able to mine these resources outside of the EU --
for example, rare earth elements from Brazil, India, Australia, China,
or Russia. [[Worsening **global security** and]{.mark} **geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}** [mean]{.mark}]{.underline} however [that [the **EU**
may need to **secure** its own supply of]{.mark} these **key
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Mining is, however, a very socially
and environmentally disruptive economic activity that is often met with
local resistance.

US President Donald [[**Trump**'s desire to acquire
Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} from Denmark [has]{.underline} recently
[[helped]{.mark} to [**highlight** the]{.mark} growing **geopolitical
[importance]{.mark}** [of the **Arctic**]{.mark} region in international
affairs]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} **global [temperatures]{.mark}**
[rise and]{.mark} **polar [icecaps]{.mark}**
[melt]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [increased [access to]{.mark}
**Arctic [resources]{.mark}** and **trade routes** look set to [make the
region]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[major focus of]{.mark} **international
[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the coming decades.

[Since]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} White House [and the Kremlin
began negotiations]{.underline} in February 2025 [to end the Russian
invasion of **Ukraine**]{.underline}, potential [**cooperation** between
the **U**nited **S**tates and **Russia** in the **Arctic** has been high
on the agenda]{.underline}. However, [[the US will face **stiff
competition**]{.mark} from **China** in this arena]{.underline}, with
Arctic initiatives occupying an important place at the heart of the
strengthening strategic relationship between Beijing and Moscow.

Maritime strategy has long played a significant role in Russian
President Vladimir Putin's thinking as he works to expand Moscow's
influence on the international stage. In August 2024, Putin ordered the
establishment of a Russian maritime collegium headed by his close
personal ally and advisor Nikolai Patrushev, who formerly led Russia's
FSB security service and the country's National Security Council.

The recent creation of a maritime collegium comes at a time when Russia
is accused of engaging in a wide range of hostile naval acts including
the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea along with
surveillance activities off the coast of Britain and other NATO member
states. Unsurprisingly, one of the stated goals of the new collegium is
to help secure Russia's national interests in the Arctic.

[[Russia's]{.mark} **Arctic [ambitions]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} similarly [[evident]{.mark} in the
country's]{.underline} current **[maritime doctrine]{.underline}**.
[Russian control [over the **N**]{.mark}orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute]{.underline}, [which runs through]{.underline} Arctic
[waters along **Russia**'s northern coast and serves as the **shortest**
shipping route between **Europe** and the **Pacific**]{.underline}, is
vital for the Kremlin's plans. With this in mind, [[Putin
is]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[prioritizing an **enlarged** and
**modernized military**]{.mark} **presence** in the Arctic region
including enhanced naval capabilities]{.underline}.

Moscow sees the Northern Sea Route as part of Russia's national
transport infrastructure and has sought to control access for shipping
from other nations. This is particularly controversial as the Northern
Sea Route covers a vast area that is expected to become increasingly
navigable in the coming years due to changing environmental conditions.
Some of the areas currently claimed by the Kremlin are situated well
beyond the territorial waters of the Russian Federation.

Critics have argued that Russia's efforts to restrict access to the
Northern Sea Route directly violate the 1982 United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, while Russia is a signatory of
the convention and ratified its commitments to UNCLOS in 1997, Kremlin
officials say the terms are not applicable to Russia's maritime claims
in the Arctic region.

[With Russia **militarizing** along the **N**orthern **S**ea **R**oute
and laying claim to large parts of the Arctic maritime
zone]{.underline}, [[the scope for]{.mark} **potential [future conflict
is huge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Geopolitical [tensions are]{.mark}
likely to be further [heightened by]{.mark} the deepening regional
involvement of **[China]{.mark}** in partnership with
**Russia**]{.underline}. [The [two]{.mark}]{.underline} nations [have
[identified the Arctic]{.mark} as a key area of
**cooperation**]{.underline}, both as a trade route linking China to
Europe [and [as a source of]{.mark} the **[natural resources]{.mark}**
that Beijing needs]{.underline} to fuel its economy.

In the years ahead, [the]{.underline} ports of the
[**[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea **[R]{.mark}**oute]{.underline}
could become increasingly important for the projection of Chinese and
Russian naval power on the international stage, both in the Arctic
region and beyond. This [could [allow]{.mark} **both
[countries]{.mark}** [to enforce]{.mark} their [claims to **Arctic
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} and overwhelm other regional nations
with less powerful navies such as Canada, Denmark, and Norway. [This is
leading to **security concerns**]{.underline} over a number of isolated
and vulnerable islands [throughout the **region**]{.underline}.

[As NATO]{.underline} member [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} around the
Baltic Sea and [[in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} [confront Russia]{.mark}
over]{.underline} its [aggressive policies]{.underline}, they [[should
be prepared for]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} to execute]{.underline} a still
**[wider range of [military]{.mark} [responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
These [responses]{.underline} will be [designed to **[deter]{.mark} [and
destabilise]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
member states [with the explicit aim of forcing]{.underline} the latter
[to **change** their **policy** towards Russia]{.underline}.

KEY POINTS

The Baltic Sea and the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} are even more
[**[important]{.mark} theatres** of [military]{.mark} show and
[operations]{.mark} for Russia]{.underline} after the accession of
Finland and Sweden to NATO.

Russian [military activities]{.underline} will [range from the fully
announced]{.underline} (e.g. exercises) [to the wholly unacknowledged
(e.g. sabotage).]{.underline}

Russia will increasingly [invite China to support]{.underline} its
[military activities]{.underline} in both theatres to bolster the effect
of these activities.

Russia will seek to reduce to a minimum any strengthening of the US
military presence in and around Greenland.

The [accession of Finland]{.underline} (2023) [and Sweden]{.underline}
(2024) to NATO has made the organisational geography simpler:
**[Russia]{.underline}** is [now **confronted by a full group of
NATO**]{.underline} member states in both the Baltic Sea region (eight
NATO member states) and [in the Arctic]{.underline} (seven NATO member
states). Russia itself has provoked this unwanted development by its
illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and by its aggressive policies
towards a long list of neighbouring countries, including Finland and
Sweden.

The [circle of NATO member states]{.underline} in the Baltic Sea region
and the Arctic -- totalling [12 individual]{.underline} states as the
Kingdom of Denmark, Sweden and Finland are in both areas --
[includes]{.underline} some of the [fiercest critics of
Russia]{.underline} as well as some of the [most ardent supporters of
Ukraine]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} fact has [**elevated** the two
**regions to even more prominent positions than usual**]{.underline} in
the Russian public debate; there is, simply put, a very [long list of
political preferences]{.underline} and decisions found within and
[across]{.underline} the 12 [NATO]{.underline} member states [that
**Russia will seek to influence and roll back**]{.underline}.

In a highly symbolic step in February 2024, Russian president Vladimir
Putin reintroduced the Leningrad Military District. This district has
been involved in some of the most controversial Soviet military
activities, including the invasion and occupation of independent
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (1939-1991) and the Winter War against
Finland (1939-1940). Its reintroduction to a large extent reflects a
political wish to tap into its many connotations of confrontation;
another wish is to signal a more focused approach in the North-Western
strategic direction, including Sweden and Finland (the latter now
representing a NATO border for Russia) as well as the Arctic.

As only two of the main doctrines underlying Russia's approach to the
Baltic Sea region and the Arctic have been revised since the full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, we have relatively little to go by in terms of
formal guidance. However, a revised Naval Doctrine was signed by Putin
in July 2022, and a revised Foreign Policy Doctrine followed in March
2023. 

"In general, if we speak about a possible [**[Russian]{.mark}
[response]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [strengthening of
NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline} Northern flank, then this will have to
[include **[all aspects]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [military]{.mark}**
security]{.underline} -- both quantitatively (..) and qualitatively".

Ilya Kramnik, Research Fellow at The Russian Institute of World Economy
and International Relations, in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 24 July 2023

The Naval Doctrine claims that "the implementation by Russia of
independent foreign and domestic policies provokes opposition from the
USA and its allies", and it adds that Russia needs to "raise the combat
potential and develop the system of bases of the Northern Fleet
(..)".1 The Foreign Policy Doctrine points to the need for Russia to
"neutralize the course of unfriendly states to militarize the \[Arctic\]
and to limit Russia's possibilities for exercising its sovereign rights
(..)".The [Foreign Policy Doctrine]{.underline} also [extends an
invitation to non-Arctic states with a "constructive policy towards
Russia]{.underline}" to join Russia in the Arctic; this should be seen
as a concession towards China, which is seeking to increase its
influence in the Arctic.2

The [[wider debate]{.underline}]{.mark} in Russia, as expressed in both
academic and commentator communities, [is [more **alarmist and
aggressive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is being [**communicated quite
strongly** to the public that recent "[**hostile**"
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular the [admission of
Finland and Sweden]{.underline} to NATO, [are [unacceptable]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} need to be [addressed]{.mark} [by]{.mark} Russia, including
by [military]{.mark} [means]{.mark}]{.underline}. An oft-made argument
is that a previous, [quite **precarious military
[balance]{.mark}**]{.underline} has been [[upset by]{.underline}]{.mark}
both the [[enlargements]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} by other
"[anti-Russian" measures taken [by]{.mark} NATO]{.underline} as a whole
[and]{.underline} by the circle of 12 Baltic Sea and Arctic NATO [member
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether acting [**[individually]{.mark}**
or collectively]{.underline}.3 The "anti-Russian" measures are said to
be a [combination of **conventional and hybrid military
activities**]{.underline} [designed to]{.underline} further
[weaken]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} position in both
theatres.4 The Russian [public]{.underline} is led to
[expect]{.underline} that the [Russian military will address this in a
robust manner,]{.underline} now and [even more so after]{.underline} the
conclusion of the war in [Ukraine]{.underline}. The accusation that NATO
member states employ hybrid measures against Russia should be seen to
[**[legitimise]{.mark}** the [use of **unconventional
approaches**]{.mark} **by Russia**]{.underline}.

[[Hybrid war]{.underline}]{.mark}

However, this central element of the Russian military thinking about the
Baltic Sea region and the Arctic is fully absent from the publicly
available sources: the use of so-called hybrid tools -- spanning the
[physical, the **[cyber]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [cognitive]{.mark}
domains**]{.underline} -- to achieve various effects. The combined
effect of these operations is such that heads-of-government of NATO
member states in January 2025 declared that, while they do not consider
themselves at war, "this is no longer peacetime".

The [Russian]{.underline} literature on [hybrid war]{.underline}
(usually claimed to be [an instrument of the West against
Russia]{.underline}) is very rich, but the essence of it may be
summarised as [causing]{.underline} a condition of "[controlled
chaos]{.underline}".5 The [extreme fusion in Russia of]{.underline}
[state-controlled and private, military and civilian]{.underline} as
well as [**[kinetic]{.mark} [and non-kinetic assets]{.mark}** provides
military planners with an extensive range of opportunities]{.underline}
[when [seek]{.mark}ing [to inflict "controlled]{.mark} [chaos]{.mark}"
on]{.underline} other Baltic Sea or [Arctic states]{.underline}.

The [focus of]{.underline} these latter [states]{.underline} is very
much [on the protection of undersea cables]{.underline} and pipelines.
On 14 January 2025, [[NATO]{.mark} announced]{.underline} the formation
of a "[Baltic Sentry]{.underline}", including surface vessels and
maritime patrol aircraft, [to monitor and protect]{.underline} this
critical [infrastructure]{.underline}. This NATO initiative represents
an [[attempt to]{.underline}]{.mark} [both defend against and
[deter]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it would be
[**[naïve]{.mark} to expect this to solve** the issue]{.underline}. The
[hybrid attack vectors]{.underline} in the Baltic Sea region -- and in
the Arctic -- [are so many]{.underline}, and the comprehensive approach
of Russia regarding the use of hybrid tools so deep-rooted, that [Russia
should be expected to continue to operate]{.underline} in this manner.
The NATO member states need to remain cognisant of the fact that it is
not just about the maritime environment; it is also about [land and air
and about cyber]{.underline}, and it is [even]{.underline} about the
[information sphere]{.underline}.

The conflict over Greenland

The [dramatic announcement]{.underline} in January 2025 by the US
administration that the [USA intends to take control of
Greenland]{.underline} is [a cause for concern for Russia.]{.underline}
The [**[Russian]{.mark}** expert community is **[unanimous]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} its **[[criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Arctic
policy [of]{.underline} the first Donald [Trump]{.underline} presidency,
often [**[labelling]{.mark} [it "confrontational]{.mark}"** [and
**"anti-Russian**]{.mark}]{.underline}" and seeing it as a departure
from an earlier, more cooperative US approach.6Valentina Matvienko,
chairwoman of the Russian Federation Council,
[[accuse]{.mark}d]{.underline} the [[US]{.mark}A [of seeking]{.mark} to
"strengthen and expand its [presence]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}" by taking over Greenland, [[adding]{.mark}
that "the **[Arctic]{.mark}** holds great strategic, geopolitical
**[importance for Russia]{.mark}"**]{.underline}.7

[Russia]{.underline} surely [welcomes conflict among NATO member
states]{.underline}, in this case between the USA on the one side and
the Kingdom of Denmark and its supporters on the other side, as this
promises to [weaken NATO cohesion and resolve]{.underline}. However,
militarily speaking, the dispute over Greenland points in one direction
only: a [significant increase in the military presence of
NATO]{.underline} in and around Greenland, which [threatens to
weaken]{.underline} the effect of the large-scale military build-up by
[Russia]{.underline} [in]{.underline} its [Arctic zone]{.underline} in
the years since 2014. This [[build-up includes]{.underline}]{.mark} the
deployment across different platforms of some of the newest Russian
[[hypersonic]{.mark} [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} [capable of carrying
[nuclear]{.mark} [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Russia [perceives]{.underline} NATO Arctic militarization as [encirclement]{.underline}, reinforcing [fear]{.underline} and [vulnerability]{.underline} that manifests in [force projection]{.underline}.

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

[From Moscow's viewpoint]{.underline}, the [**[perceived]{.mark}**
'[enlargement']{.mark} [of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} to Finland and
Sweden is [[fuel]{.mark}ing]{.underline} both a sense of
[**[vindication]{.mark} and vulnerability** [across]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[AZRF]{.underline}]{.mark} -- geographically extending from the
North Atlantic and the European High North, to North Pole approaches in
the Central Arctic, to the North Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, [Russia's]{.underline} self-inflicted **[[fear of
'encirclement'1]{.underline}]{.mark}**)by the Atlantic Alliance has been
[validated by]{.underline} Finland and Sweden joining
[NATO]{.underline}. The double accession represents a fait accompli for
the Kremlin, [honed by a self-reinforcing propagandistic
**[narrative]{.mark}** that the **[Alliance]{.mark} [is turning]{.mark}
the [Arctic]{.mark} [into]{.mark} [a 'conflict
zone'2]{.mark}**]{.underline}) or that there is a ['new Cold
War'3]{.underline}) in the region **[because of Western
policy.]{.underline}**

This [narrative]{.underline} is [compounded by]{.underline} the [recent
release of the US National Strategy for the Arctic]{.underline} Region

which are also [denounced as 'deciding the region's future by
force'4) or 'inviting confrontation'5]{.underline}) [in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

Finland and Sweden joining the [Alliance]{.underline} further
[fuels]{.underline} the [Russian logic that the non-Russian Arctic has
become 'NATO territory]{.underline}'. This ends up creating a '[[NATO 7
vs. Russia'6]{.mark})approach]{.underline}, which [tends to
[securitize]{.mark} [Arctic affairs]{.mark} and shape discussions
increasingly in military terms]{.underline}. The policy consequences are
that [Moscow]{.underline} is [planning more than ever]{.underline} for
all contingencies, [[including **open military confrontation**]{.mark}
in the Arctic.]{.underline}

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, the impact of the [war has led
Moscow to feel vulnerable in the]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline}. This
vulnerability is [strategic]{.underline} ([with]{.underline} the
[perceived 'expansion' of NATO]{.underline}) and military, especially
with regards to the impact of climate change and receding sea ice across
the AZRF.

The [[Russia]{.mark}n leadership **[fears]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [a
more accessible [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} will
[[bring]{.underline}]{.mark} along more [[military activity from
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies in the European Arctic and
above North Pole approaches. It also [fears]{.underline} there will be
[more military presence from the US]{.underline} and Canada in the
Pacific Arctic -- alongside Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance
and presence.

The July 2024 [[Ukrain]{.mark}ian drone strike7]{.underline}) on the
Olenya air base in the northwestern Russian Arctic, where strategic
bombers are stationed, also **[[reinforces]{.mark} their sense of
[vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- not least by defying the
genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air defense capabilities.

Ultimately, [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} [does not [want]{.mark} to be
dispossessed of]{.underline} its [[control]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the
[AZRF]{.mark}]{.underline}. The fact that [[NATO]{.mark}'s direct
borders]{.underline} with Russia have increased in size in the Arctic
and Baltic theaters [will]{.underline} [undoubtedly [push]{.mark} the
[Kremlin]{.mark} [to adapt]{.mark} its **[force
projection]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This situation will also [force]{.underline} the [Kremling to rethink
the deployment of capabilities across the Arctic]{.underline} -- not
least towards regional chokepoints in the European High North such as
the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap.

[Four Big Threats]{.underline}

That, **[[crisis isn't wholly]{.mark} about
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}** despite his inimitable ability to make
nearly everything about himself. [NATO]{.underline} [is currently being
tested by **[four]{.mark} convergent [crises]{.mark} that [run
deeper]{.mark}** than Trump's disruptive effects]{.underline}.

[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, a crisis of security, created by [Russia's
serial aggression in the East]{.underline}. Since 2022,
[NATO]{.underline} has responded by [**[supporting]{.mark}
[Ukraine]{.mark}'s** fight for survival]{.underline}; the alliance
expanded to include Finland and Sweden, and its members ramped up
spending on defense. But European defense chiefs fear that [if Moscow
wins]{.underline} in Ukraine, [it might test NATO
militarily]{.underline}, perhaps in Baltic states that are half-ringed
by Russian power. [Even if it doesn't, NATO will face an angry,
hyper-militarized adversary]{.underline}, one that is already [waging
hybrid warfare]{.underline} --- subversion, sabotage, political meddling
--- from one end of the continent to the other.

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, a crisis of preparation. After the Cold
War, [NATO]{.underline} grew more geographically ambitious: It
[intervened]{.underline} "out of area," [in]{.underline} locales from
the [Balkans to [Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}. But it **[became less
militarily capable]{.underline}**, thanks to a [quarter-century [peace
dividend]{.mark}]{.underline}. By the mid-2010s, German troops were,
ridiculously, **[exercising with broomsticks in place of
guns.]{.underline}**

Weakness was a testament to success: [NATO]{.underline} had [created a
cocoon of]{.underline} [security]{.underline} [that allowed European
states to disarm]{.underline}. But that [weakness intensified
accusations of free riding by Washington]{.underline} and left the
alliance ill-prepared to confront a resurgent Russian threat.

[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}, a crisis of [shifting
priorities]{.underline}. Europe was Washington's top priority in the
Cold War because it was the crucial swing region, economically and
militarily, in the Soviet American contest. Since then, however, the
[world's center of economic [gravity]{.mark} has [moved]{.mark} to the
[east]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[primary]{.mark} military [danger zone
is]{.mark} not the Fulda Gap but the [Taiwan]{.mark}
Strait]{.underline}.

American attention is shifting, fitfully but inevitably, to the Pacific.
"Asia Firsters" are asking whether the US should still underwrite
European stability in an Indo-Pacific age.

[[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is the **[crisis of
[credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Europeans have always wondered
[[whether]{.mark} the [US will be there]{.mark} when it
matters]{.underline}. How could those fears not be turbocharged in the
age of Trump?

Defending North Pole approaches

[[Russia has a militarized understanding of]{.mark} access to and
passage through [the NSR.]{.mark} Its military [presence]{.mark} in the
central Arctic [enhances]{.mark} perimeter defence and the defence
of approaches from both sides of the AZRF, giving Russia increased
[situational and domain awareness]{.mark} over the NSR.48]{.underline}

Russia's attitude towards the central Arctic and the North Pole explains
the multiplication and hardening of air-defence capabilities,
early-warning systems and domain-awareness capabilities deployed on the
archipelagos across the NSR. Russia's disparate network of forward
bases, airfields and outposts there represents a mix of civilian and
military installations for search and rescue (SAR) operations, maritime
domain awareness (MDA) and border protection.49 Currently, priority
is given to strengthening existing infrastructure, rather than
developing new installations.50

[In line with the Basic Principles of Russian Federation State Policy
in the Arctic to 2035,51 [official rhetoric claims]{.mark} that the
network of civilian and military [installations aims to 'respond
promptly to possible threats to the safety of navigation']{.mark}52 and
to 'increase the security' of the NSR.53 However, for over a decade, the
refurbishment and building of military infrastructure along the NSR has
been 'designed primarily for performing air-space defence
functions'.54]{.underline}

Installations were built with off-the-shelf military hardware to save
costs and time, but their primary function is to support Northern and
Pacific Fleet operations in terms of transit, protection, logistics and
resupply along the lifelines of the AZRF. Russia has also been laying
trans-Arctic fibre-optic cables along the NSR to link military
installations across the AZRF55 -- which could be used to monitor
submarine activity56 -- and has recently deployed Arktika-M
remote-sensing satellites to enhance domain awareness.5

The NSR is only navigable seasonally, not year-round, and does not
represent a convenient transit route for military vessels. This means
passage through the NSR still largely has an expeditionary purpose for
Russian fleets. Nevertheless, training increasingly focuses on the
protection of NSR assets,58 including amphibious assault landings,59 and
on controlling its airspace.

[Finally, [control]{.mark} over the NSR [gives Russia]{.mark} increased
[defence]{.mark} in depth [against]{.mark} a multitude of [perceived
threats]{.mark}.60 With an emphasis on air defence,61 early warning and
domain awareness, Russia seeks to defend North Pole approaches from US
strategic bomber overflights across the North Pole, [from
US b]{.mark}allistic-[m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efence in the region62
[and]{.mark} from increased [subsurface presence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Russian Redlines and Escalation?

A [redline]{.underline} is a [policy tool]{.underline} used by policy
makers to [distinguish acceptable from unacceptable
actions]{.underline}, to [set limits of what will be tolerated and what
will not]{.underline}. This, in turn, shapes an adversary's options and
deters them from certain actions that would cross escalatory retaliatory
thresholds. As such, [[redlines]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[seek to
mitigate]{.mark} the risk of military [accidents]{.mark}, technical
failures, [and]{.mark} **strategic
[misperceptions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[miscommunication]{.underline}**, or [misjudgments]{.underline}
[leading to]{.underline} unintended [unpredictable]{.underline}
dangerous [outcomes]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [uncontrollable
momentum]{.underline}. As Erik Lin-Greenburg observes, in practice,
[redline]{.underline} [thresholds]{.underline} [can be]{.underline}
geographic or be target specific---[the number]{.underline} or
constitution [of military personnel]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the
use of [uncrewed aerial vehicles]{.underline}. [Redlines]{.underline}
can also involve [limits]{.underline} to [intensity and duration of
attacks]{.underline}, levels of physical damage and casualties, and
levels of harm inflicted relating to method of attack, such as mass
salvo or precision strikes. Finally, they can be [made public or
conveyed secretly to the adversary]{.underline}. 

[Theoretically]{.underline}, setting clear, [sharp redlines
[involve]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} accepting tradeoffs between [a
**[commitment]{.mark}
[trap]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[losing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[freedom]{.underline} of maneuver[, decision-making
**[autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or being **[trapped into [unwanted
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**---and a reputational credibility trap,
if the redline setter does not act when the line has been crossed.
However[, if **redline thresholds are too sharp**, explicit, and clearly
defined, this may [encourage]{.mark} **[rivals]{.mark}** [to **discover
just how far they can**]{.mark} **go**]{.underline}, and so [encourage
action below the redline where]{.underline}, by implication, [everything
is permitted]{.underline}. [Ambiguity]{.underline} can [enhance
deterrence]{.underline} by [forcing]{.underline} opponents to exercise
[restraint]{.underline}, lest they cross an escalation threshold. Yet
such ambiguity may make breaches unverifiable and so diminish the
credibility of a redline, raising the prospect that provocations will
lead to a crisis and uncontrolled escalation. To navigate the dilemma,
those drawing redlines are both clear and ambiguous in the two elements
that constitute the redlines: clarity on either the circumstances or the
consequences of breaching such redlines and ambiguity in the other.
[Putin has the advantage]{.underline}; his [complete domestic control of
the media]{.underline} and the narrative means [he suffers little or no
domestic reputational damage when his redlines are ignored]{.underline}.
But that also means [**his redlines** should have **no deterrent
effect** on his external adversaries.]{.underline}

Prior to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, [[Putin]{.underline} [defined
redlines]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of "interests,"
"[**[interference]{.mark}," "insults," [and]{.mark}
"[infringements]{.mark}**"]{.underline} and ["in each case we shall
decide for ourselves where it lies]{.underline}" (BBC Monitoring, RIA
Novosti, Moscow, in Russian, 1248 gmt, April 21, 2021).  He
[[warned]{.mark} that [if Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[redlines]{.mark} were crossed or [violated]{.mark}]{.underline}, it
would [result in an "asymmetrical, rapid and harsh"
response]{.underline}; "provocateurs" would ["**[regret]{.mark} their
[actions]{.mark} [like]{.mark} they have [never regretted anything
before]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (BBC Monitoring, RIA Novosti, Moscow, in
Russian, 1248 gmt, April 21, 2021). In this period, [Russian
redlines]{.underline} consisted of four rather abstract but
inter-enabling must nots. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [must
[not]{.mark} 1) [accept]{.mark} [interference]{.mark}]{.underline} and
interventions [in]{.underline} its [domestic affairs]{.underline}; 2)
[allow]{.underline} [its influence and **[strategic importance to
be]{.mark} [rejected]{.mark}, ignored, [or]{.mark} [marginalized by
external actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}; 3) [accept]{.underline}
[restrictions]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [its freedom to
act]{.underline}; and, 4) [lose]{.underline} the right or [ability to
influence strategic decisions and set conditions]{.underline}.
[Putin]{.underline} [clearly stated]{.underline} that
[[Ukraine]{.mark}'s]{.underline} [NATO membership [was a
redline]{.mark}]{.underline}: "The flight time from, let's say, Kharkov
and, I don't know, Dnepropetrovsk to central Russia, to Moscow, will
shrink to 7-10 minutes.  Is it a redline for us or not?" "Foreign," that
is NATO, bases (Putin appeared agnostic on Turkish and Chinese) on
post-Soviet territory or Belarus' strategic reorientation westwards were
also redlines.   

More concretely, since February 2022, [Russia's
[redlines]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[include]{.mark}d Western sanctions
against Russia; military aid]{.underline}, "from man-portable air
defense systems in early 2022, to howitzers, [multiple rocket launchers,
**[ground-based air defense]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}, tanks, fighter
[jets, and]{.mark} tactical [ballistic
missiles]{.mark}**,]{.underline}" and [targeting]{.underline} within
[Russian territory]{.underline}, never mind a ground invasion and
occupation of the Kursk region. Most recently, on September 12,
2024, Putin warned that if Kyiv is permitted to use long-range weaponry
for conventional destruction of Russian long-range bombers, ballistic
missile submarine fleets, Russia's defense industrial complex, strategic
radar networks, training facilities, and tactical airpower, then the war
in Ukraine will become a NATO-Russia confrontation.

[Russian military [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} and analysts
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[that]{.mark} their
[**counterspace** weapons provide a means to **restore strategic
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu
characterized the test as a routine operation of a "[cutting-edge future
weapon system]{.underline}" [to [strengthen]{.mark} Russia's
[**deterrent** and **defense** against]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} attempts to
attain "**[comprehensive military advantage]{.mark}**" [in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}.3

[[Russian leaders believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [a change
in]{.underline} the [character of warfare has been
**unfolding**]{.underline} over the past three decades. They write that
the [[next gen]{.mark}eration [of war]{.mark}fare [will be]{.mark} waged
in the **[aerospace]{.mark} domain**]{.underline} with weapons [[enabled
by **satellite** targeting and navigation]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 For
instance, in a 2015 speech, President Vladimir Putin asserted that U.S.
and NATO forces possess "high-precision long-range non-nuclear weapons
comparable in their effect to nuclear weapons."5 [Russians [fear
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a conflict, [these [weapons]{.mark} may be
[**used against them** in a **coordinated strike**]{.mark} against their
nuclear and conventional forces]{.underline}.

At a 2013 conference attended by several cabinet ministers and members
of the Russian Military-Industrial Commission, Deputy Prime Minister
Dmitri Rogozin identified five conflict scenarios that Russia could face
in the future.6 One of them involved a noncontact war with a
technologically advanced adversary, presumably the United States and
NATO. In this scenario, the [United States would **strike** the Russian
homeland]{.underline}, [[drawing]{.mark} from its "**[lightning-fast
global strike]{.mark}**" weapons]{.underline} using satellite targeting
and navigation. Rogozin suggested that such a [strike could
[destroy]{.mark} **80 to [90 percent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} Russia's
strategic [arsenal]{.mark}, **[rendering]{.mark}** its [nuclear
deterrent]{.mark} almost **[useless]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

These [scenarios reflect a **worst-case analysis**]{.underline} that may
not match reality. As Vladimir Dvorkin, a former Russian military
officer with deep involvement in Russian nuclear policies, has noted,
"\[I\]t seems rather fantastical to suggest that the Pentagon could be
planning a disarming conventional strike against Russia's strategic
nuclear forces: such a measure would not only prove absolutely useless,
but would trigger a devastating retaliatory nuclear strike."7 Dvorkin
suggests Russia's intercontinental ballistic missile silos are hardened
to withstand any such strikes, its mobile launchers are difficult to
target, and its ballistic missile submarines can be dispersed quickly
and are protected by naval forces.

[Yet]{.underline}, these [**[fears permeate]{.mark}** the Russian debate
on the **aerospace capabilities** of U.S. and NATO forces]{.underline}.
[[Russian military]{.mark} exercises are]{.underline} now [[designed
to]{.mark} "**[repel a]{.mark} massive**" aerospace [strike by
**hypersonic**]{.mark} weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [short- and
medium-range **[cruise missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and
**ballistic missiles**]{.underline}]{.mark} with highly mobile anti-air
and anti-space units.8 Russian planning also includes ASAT weapons to
target the critical satellite systems that enable these modern aerospace
weapons.9

#### Consensus [agrees]{.underline}. ASATs are the [most logical]{.underline} response.

Notwithstanding these assessments, [most Russian [analysts display

Although these fears may reflect an extreme worst-case scenario,
[many]{.underline} Russian military analysts [share them]{.underline}.
Therefore, they argue, the [[dependence of]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. and

U.S. military activities related to]{.mark} the [space]{.mark} domain
[are threatening]{.mark} and reflect **hostile U.S. intent**. This
[finding is consistent with]{.mark} the political science literature,
specifically the [action-reaction model]{.mark}, which hypothesizes
[that states react to]{.mark} the [arming of other states]{.mark},
[fueled by uncertainties]{.mark} about intentions and capability.177 It
is also consistent with the contention that states tend to overestimate
the capabilities of their adversaries.178 These two insights help us
understand why]{.underline} China and [Russia appear to perceive U.S.
military activities in the space domain as threatening and that this
perception has been the consistent narrative reflected in
native-language primary sources since SDI.]{.underline}

Yet [[U.S. actions]{.mark} also seem to be [interpreted through]{.mark}
**the [lens of the state of the relationship]{.mark}** at a given point
in time.]{.underline} Perhaps unsurprisingly, [[when]{.mark} the
political relationship between Washington and Beijing or Moscow is more
[confrontational]{.mark} and fractious, the same [actions]{.mark} are
[perceived]{.mark} to be [more threatening]{.mark}, [and when]{.mark}
bilateral relations are (relatively) more [friendly]{.mark}, similar
[actions]{.mark} are [not viewed as]{.mark} quite as
[threatening.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, while the perception of
threat has been consistent over time, there has been a deepening of the
sense of hostility since 2008, following the issuance of the 2006
National Space Policy and Operation Burnt Frost. Chinese and Russian
analyses reviewed for this report generally noted a more [positive,
cooperative approach toward space by the Clinton and Obama
administrations but still focused on their perceived overarching
continuity of hostile and aggressive U.S. military space policy. This
[suggests]{.mark} that existing negative [perceptions]{.mark} held in
Beijing and Moscow are relatively easily [reinforced by]{.mark} those
U.S. [actions perceived as hostile]{.mark}, while U.S. [actions
perceived as]{.mark} [less hostile do not]{.mark} appear to
[have]{.mark} a similarly robust [effect]{.mark}, producing a seemingly
minimal improvement in Chinese and Russian perceptions. This
[behavior]{.mark} might [reflect]{.mark} the natural, human
[tendency]{.mark} [toward confirmation bias.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet it
is important for U.S. decisionmakers to understand that this is
occurring.

Military insecurity

[[Russia's relations]{.mark} with Western countries in the Arctic have
been [entangled in]{.mark} a ["security dilemma"]{.mark} for over a
decade: actions taken by one state to enhance its security often lead to
countermeasures by others, [fuelling]{.mark} a cycle of tension and
[militarisation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While the EU has focused more on a peaceful agenda related to climate
and Indigenous issues, the US and some NATO member states have been
developing their military capabilities in the Arctic in response to
similar actions by the Kremlin. For example, since 2022, the US expanded
NATO military exercises and infrastructure upgrades in Alaska, while
Norway has undertaken comparable efforts to bolster its Arctic defence
posture using its own military base. Such Western actions have only
increased Russia's perceived military insecurities.

In particular, [Russia's main military [insecurity]{.mark} in the Arctic
[stems from]{.mark} the Kremlin's nuclear deterrence strategy. A
significant share of Russia's nuclear arsenal is deployed on
[Arctic-based submarines]{.mark}, [which form the core of]{.mark} its
[second-strike capability]{.mark}. [Russia's ability to deploy]{.mark}
these submarines in the northern seas [while]{.mark} remaining
[undetected]{.mark} by foreign forces [is key to its nuclear
deterrence]{.mark} strategy. As a result, the [Kremlin views Western
reconnaissance, research and patrols as]{.mark} potential [threats aimed
at detecting these assets.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The alarming rate of Arctic ice melt in recent years has further
fuelled Russia's anxious reactions. The [reduction in ice]{.mark} cover
along with the development of modern acoustic and radar methods can
[help reveal]{.mark} previously hidden Russian
[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}, [increasing]{.mark} their
[vulnerability]{.mark}. [Ice melt also brings]{.mark} broader security
concerns for the Kremlin. As [navigation]{.mark} becomes
[easier]{.mark}, Russia's vast northern [coastline]{.mark} is
[losing]{.mark} its [natural defence]{.mark} barrier.
[Moscow increasingly fears this]{.mark} may [weaken its]{.mark} Northern
Fleet's [ability to deter]{.mark} a [conventional]{.mark} Western
[attack]{.mark} from the north, [prompting further militarisation of the
region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The central question raised by the expanding Russian military
infrastructure in the Arctic is whether it warrants growing concern that
regional stability is seriously eroding. [Is Russia on track to mount
forces that go beyond defense requirements and that will enable it to
project power in ways that threaten its Arctic neighbors and thus
pressure them to mount commensurate military responses? And the
follow-up question is, are expanded military capacities and operations
by the other Arctic states the most effective way to respond to Russia's
Arctic military expansion?]{.underline}

[The [top strategic mission for Russia]{.mark}'s Arctic
forces]{.underline}, which remain well short of Soviet Cold War levels,
[[is to protect its submarine-based second-strike]{.mark} nuclear
deterrent forces. That means keeping American anti-submarine warfare
forces at bay. [Russia]{.mark} has [sought to]{.mark} manage that
contest by trying to [cordon off]{.mark} a maritime bastion that
encompasses the [Barents Sea]{.mark} out [to]{.mark} at least the
[Novaya Zemlya]{.mark}, Franz Josef, and Svalbard archipelagos, as well
as to the northern edges of the Norwegian Sea. It guards those waters
with patrol aircraft, surface vessels, and attack submarines in the
[interests of establishing a zone]{.mark} in [which]{.mark} its
[SSBNs]{.mark} can [patrol freely]{.mark}, not threatened by American
attack submarines, and be available to deliver a devastating retaliatory
attack on the heartlands of the United States and its NATO allies in the
event of a nuclear attack on Russia.]{.underline}

It is, to be sure, a grizzly scenario of potential catastrophe by
deliberate choice, [but [it remains the essence of]{.mark} deterrence
based on [m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured [d]{.mark}estruction. The
United States and China similarly go to great lengths to keep their
SSBNs beyond the reach of their adversaries' attack submarines. Within a
deterrence framework, the point of [preserving]{.mark} an assured
[retaliatory]{.mark} destruction [capacity is]{.mark} not therefore
[to]{.mark} threaten initial attack, but to [threaten
retaliation]{.mark} to remove any incentive for an adversary to initiate
a nuclear attack. [A state that can not protect]{.mark} its deterrent,
that [is]{.mark}, [a state that cannot assure retaliation]{.mark}
because its second-strike forces are vulnerable to pre-emptive attack,
is [essentially left with two options]{.mark}: [expand]{.mark} its
[second-strike arsenal]{.mark} to restore confidence that enough of it
would survive a first strike to still be able to deliver the devastating
counter attack; [or]{.mark} decide, in times of high tension when
conflict is deemed inevitable, to [launch first]{.mark}, before an
adversary could attack them ([the "use them or lose them"
scenario]{.mark}). The first option is inimical to arms control, the
second [radically escalates]{.mark} the [danger of]{.mark} a [conflict
"going nuclear."]{.mark} In other words, as long as the nuclear
confrontation persists, maritime bastions for SSBNs, from which attack
submarines are effectively excluded, reinforce deterrence and stability.
The Americans are less reliant on such a bastion inasmuch as their SSBNs
can get to vast Atlantic and Pacific Ocean expanses, without having to
move through any choke point, where they can more readily evade
pursuers. Russia's assertive protection of its second-strike deterrent
does not pose a threat to its adversaries.]{.underline}

However, the key problem is that, even though the deterrence paradigm
relies on an assured second strike, [both Russia and especially the
United States continue to hone [sub-tracking skills and
tech]{.mark}nologies for the purpose of rendering second-strike
deterrent forces vulnerable to pre-emptive attack. The [result]{.mark}
being the [Russian worry that]{.mark}, without robust defenses in place,
their [Barents Sea]{.mark} bastion could one day become routinely
[accessible to American]{.mark} attack submarine [patrols]{.mark}. A
March 2018 Pentagon report, "Commander's Intent for the United States
Submarine Force," describes "the main role" of U.S. attack sub marines
as being to "hold the adversary's strategic assets at risk from the
undersea."44 "[Strategic]{.mark}" in that context [means
nuclear]{.mark}, making it [a message that exacerbates Russian
worries.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The **Arctic** is]{.underline} "[where the **confrontation** of the
world's **leading states** is unfolding]{.underline}," the head of the
Russian Navy said at a recent forum in St. Petersburg where regional
cooperation had traditionally dominated the agenda.

"[In addition to **political** and **economic measures**]{.underline} to
contain Russia in the Arctic, [**unfriendly states** are **increasing**
their military **presence** in the region]{.underline}," [said Adm.
Aleksandr **Moiseev**]{.underline}, who took command of the Russian Navy
in March. [He specifically mentioned the United States'
**re-establishing** the **Second Fleet**]{.underline} in 2018 [and
the]{.underline} 2021 [**creation** of NATO's **J**oint **F**orce
**C**ommand]{.underline} in Norfolk.

Moissev said [one reason for the **rise in tensions** has been Moscow's
**suspension** from the]{.underline} eight-member **[Arctic
Council]{.underline}**, following the invasion of Ukraine in February
2022, and the placing of economic sanctions on Russian financial
institutions, businesses and individuals.

The other seven nations in the forum are NATO members.

He added that [**updated** Arctic **strategies**]{.underline}, including
the United States, "[enshrine an **anti-Russian focus** and also allow
for the **thesis** that the nationalization of the
**N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute
by the Russian Federation [is **inadmissible**]{.underline}. Also,
[unfriendly states are **increasing** their military

**[Non-Western experts]{.underline}** tend to [assess
Washington's]{.underline} new [military strategy in the Arctic **more
negatively**]{.underline}. In particular, [Chinese]{.underline}
[military experts]{.underline}, assessing the US strategy,
[note]{.underline} its [confronta- tional nature]{.underline}, which is
determined not by the regional agenda, but by the general deterioration
of relations between Russia and the West. They [believe]{.underline}
that [[China's]{.mark} military capabilities and ambi- tions in the
Arctic are clearly exaggerated and have an ideological]{.underline}
(anti-Chinese) [character]{.underline}. They point out that China has
come first in threat assessments that are based on unsubstantiated at-
tribution of aggressive intentions to it, which speaks in favor of the
deterioration of US-Chinese relations both in the Arctic and in other
regions 36 .

[In **their [opinion]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [**[US
strategy]{.mark}** will contribute to the **[further]{.mark}
[escalation]{.mark} [of military threats]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [arms
race]{.mark}** in the **Far North**]{.underline}. They believe that the
restoration of coordination mechanisms and military confidence-building
measures in the Arctic may take a long time. Non-Arctic observer states
in the Arctic Council can make a certain contribution to normalization
by participating in consultations and creating new mechanisms for
regional coordination. China's interest in military cooperation with
Russia in the Arctic can be explained by its [[intention]{.mark} [to
prevent Russia]{.mark} from be- coming excessively weakened under
increasing pressure from the US]{.underline}/NATO and to preserve the
Northern Sea Route as an alternative route to Europe, given the
instability in the Persian Gulf and Suez Canal \[12, Petrovskiy V.E.\].

The [Russian]{.underline} [expert community notes that the new US
military strategy]{.underline} in the Far North [fits into plans to
ensure a permanent presence in the Arctic]{.underline} in economic,
political and military dimen- sions, as well as to gain dominant
positions in the region 37. This document shows that the [US is going to
take full advantage]{.underline} of Finland and Sweden joining NATO and
the prospect of freeing the Arctic seas from ice by 2030.

At the same time, according to a number of Russian analysts, firstly,
the text of the strategy prioritizes stability over increasing strategic
competition in the region. Secondly, the US is not yet ready for a
military confrontation in the Arctic, if only because it does not
possess a "full-fledged grouping of forces and means to conduct
large-scale operations". Thus, Russia has a pause of sev- eral years
from direct military pressure, which does not cancel other, non-military
means of deter- rence from the West. In addition, the US intends to
actively attract investment from allies to cre- ate a common military
infrastructure in the Arctic 38 .

It can be assumed that the US Department of Defense will adopt an
additional document, more clearly disclosing the concept and action plan
within the framework of the strategy. This is indirectly confirmed by
the "National Intelligence Estimate", published by the National
Intelligence Council, to which experts from the US Congressional
Research Service refer: as a result of global warming,
[[competition]{.mark} for Arctic resources [will
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}, which will lead to an [aggravation of
rela- tions between Arctic and non-Arctic states]{.underline}, an
[increase in military activity]{.underline} in the region by non- Arctic
states [to protect their [investments]{.mark}]{.underline}, [new
[transport routes]{.mark}]{.underline} and to gain strategic advantages
over competitors. [According to the National Intelligence Council, an
open military conflict is possi- ble in the Arctic in the
future]{.underline}. It could either [[involve]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} and unnamed non-Arctic states
[**[if]{.mark} [they]{.mark} persistently [show military]{.mark}**
[**activity**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the straits of the
[Northern Sea Route, which Russia considers to be internal
waters]{.underline} (obviously, we are talking about US allies).
[Or]{.underline} it will be a conflict between [[China]{.mark} and the
Arctic states [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the event of its **[[economic
consolidation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Arctic 39 .

Conclusion

The [new US military [strategy]{.mark} in the Arctic
[considers]{.mark}]{.underline} the policies of the
[[Russia]{.mark}n]{.underline} Federation [[and]{.mark} [China]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} a **[destabilizing]{.mark} factor** in the region and
**[leaves no space for cooperation]{.mark}** with them, which may
**[lead to]{.mark} an [escalation]{.mark}** of tensions in the region in
the medium term]{.underline}. The US has gained a significant
geopolitical advantage due to its guaranteed military presence in
Finland and Sweden. At the same time, the strategy does not contain a
clear statement of the threats that come from he Russian Federation and
China. The [plans for]{.underline} a very specific build-up of
[**[infrastructure]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}/NATO military
[presence]{.mark}** in the Arctic are [a **response to
imaginary**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} that could only
hypo- thetically arise from the Russian Federation and China.
Apparently, there is still no consensus with- in the US Department of
Defense and the expert and analytical community on the content of the US
military policy in the Arctic. This is largely due to the reluctance to
get involved in a military es- calation with Russia and the
understanding that the US has insufficient resources for a more of-
fensive policy in the Arctic.

[The United States has de facto included the Arctic in NATO's zone of
responsibility]{.underline}, and the official announcement of this by
the alliance itself remains a formality. In the Arctic, Russia's land
border with NATO has increased to one and a half thousand kilometers.
The US sees the expansion of the alliance to include Sweden and Finland
as a step to strengthen its global dominance and as a springboard for
containing Russia and China in the Arctic.

In the perspective of 2030, the [new strategy]{.underline} is [aimed at
the progressive expansion of the US military infrastructure]{.underline}
in Alaska and Northern European countries; accumulating experience in
conducting operations in the North American and European parts of the
Arctic; **[further increasing the number and duration of anti-Russian
military maneuvers]{.underline}** with the development of deployment
elements and offensive actions. The [depth of military
cooperation]{.underline} between Finland and the Unit- ed States and
whether the new military strategy is provided [with funding will be of
key im- portance for Russia's security]{.underline}. At the same time,
the US will try to shift a significant portion of mili- tary costs to
European countries, especially to NATO "neophytes" such as Finland and
Sweden.

The [build-up of permanent US/NATO military presence and military
infrastructure]{.underline} in Fin- land, Sweden and Norway [[creates
the **main threat to Russia's security**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[If]{.underline} the [US]{.underline} strategic [plans are
implemented,]{.underline} not only [Russia's strategic [nuclear]{.mark}
[arsenal]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [Kola Peni]{.mark}nsula]{.underline},
but also [densely populated industrial areas [and]{.mark}
military-[industrial enterprises]{.mark}]{.underline} located both in
the North-West and in the central regions of Russia, [will be at
risk]{.underline}. The **[[increas]{.mark}ing [risks of]{.mark} a
[military conflict]{.mark} in the Arctic will be [linked]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [Russia's survival]{.mark} and will require appropriate
response measures]{.underline}**.

Now, [that **spirit of [cooperation]{.mark}** [is
**fraying**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As the Arctic's icecap
melts]{.underline} away, [new **trade routes** are emerging and with
them]{.underline} a set of [new **security challenges**]{.underline}.
Over the past several years, [[Russia has **rebuilt** its military
**presence**]{.mark} along the **N**orthern **S**ea
**R**oute]{.underline}---the newly accessible shipping lane that runs
from just east of Norway all the way to the Bering Strait---in order [to
ensure safe passage for **container ships**]{.underline}, [counter
**smuggling** and other **illicit activities**]{.underline}, [and
defend]{.underline} several thousand miles of [northern
border]{.underline} left unprotected by the retreating ice. [Throughout
the region]{.underline}, [Moscow is [**enhancing** its]{.mark}
**military [capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2014, [[Russia
created a new **military district**]{.underline}]{.mark} with
responsibility [[for the]{.mark} entire **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
region, stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, and in
2017 it [began to build a small fleet of **icebreaking
vessels**]{.underline} equipped for antisubmarine warfare, although the
ships will not enter service for several years. Russian strategic air
patrols off the coast of Alaska, which resumed back in 2007, and their
[routine [**interception** by]{.mark} U.S. **military [jets]{.mark}**
have]{.underline} also [**[draw]{.mark}**n]{.underline} more [attention
recently as [**suspicions** of **Russian intentions**]{.mark} mount in
Washington]{.underline}. NATO, meanwhile, has voiced concerns about
increased Russian submarine movements near the so-called GIUK
(Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom) gap, a naval chokepoint in the
North Atlantic.

Partly in response to all this activity, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} re[**building** its own]{.mark}
**military [capabilities]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}, which
have atrophied since the end of the Cold War. Besides tracking Russian
submarines near the GIUK gap, [Washington has stepped up its **strategic
air patrols**]{.underline} off the coast of Siberia [to **probe**
Russian defense systems and gather]{.underline} other
**[intelligence]{.underline}**. The Trump administration also plans to
build a fleet of icebreakers to carry out what it has referred to as
"national and economic security missions" in the Arctic. Additional
[investments will]{.underline} likely [be necessary down the
line]{.underline}, both [to police commercial activities]{.underline}
along the Alaskan coast and [throughout the]{.underline} U.S.
[**e**xclusive **e**conomic **z**one and to defend the]{.underline}
country's commitment to freedom of navigation in the **[polar
region]{.underline}**.

[[Neither side's actions are]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily
[**[aggressive]{.mark}** in **nature**]{.underline}, [[nor do they
portend an **impending**]{.mark} **geopolitical
[fight]{.mark}**]{.underline} over who controls the region. [In
fact]{.underline}, [Russia's]{.underline} military [**buildup** has
taken place solely in areas where its **legal authority** is
**undisputed**]{.underline}. Submarine and aircraft [activity near the
GIUK gap and off the Alaskan coast is a part of Russia's global strategy
to **deter** potential]{.underline} military [attacks and **not
focused** on the **Arctic**]{.underline} per se. [Much the same is true
of **U.S. actions**]{.underline} in and around the region.

[[At a time of **deepening distrust**]{.underline}]{.mark} between the
United States and Russia, however, [[the danger is that]{.mark} even
[**actions** taken for **legitimate**]{.mark} security [reasons]{.mark}
could [**spark** unnecessary]{.mark} **geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Hard-liners]{.underline}]{.mark} in
both countries, [[intent on **inflating**]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} already
[**[paint]{.mark}**ing [a picture of the Arctic as a site of]{.mark}
**intense geopolitical [competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and because
the overall state of U.S.-Russian relations is so dismal, [they are
gaining **traction**]{.underline}. It is not difficult to imagine an
incident that would further reinforce their views. Russia, for example,
considers the Northern Sea Route to be within its territorial waters,
whereas the United States maintains that the passage is in international
waters. Should Washington insist on carrying out freedom-of-navigation
exercises there (as it did in May in the Barents Sea, at the western end
of the maritime route through Russian waters), a standoff with Russia,
even a military clash, might ensue.

[The **[growing suspicion]{.mark}** on both sides
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} not **[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** just
in its own right. [[It could]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[impede
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in areas [where]{.underline} U.S. and
Russian [interests still **align**]{.underline}---chief among them the
environmental problems that climate change has created in the Arctic.
Russia, in particular, has its work cut out for it. Last year, a report
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that thawing
permafrost, which can lead normally frozen ground surfaces to melt and
collapse, threatened to inflict serious damage on several Russian oil
and gas facilities in the Arctic that together account for 45 percent of
the country's production capacity. An assessment by the Arctic Council
in 2017 came to similar conclusions. Sure enough, this June, a large
storage tank filled with diesel fuel collapsed after thawing permafrost
caused its foundation to sink. The accident caused an Exxon
Valdez--sized oil spill that has spread to the nearby Lake Pyasino and
possibly the Pyasina River, which flows into the Arctic Ocean.

Nevertheless, Russia has the will and intentions to threaten one or more
NATO countries, and it is steadily rebuilding its military capabilities
thanks, in part, to aid from China, Iran, and North Korea. Russian
military think-ing is dominated by a view that the United States
is---and will remain---Moscow's main enemy (главный враг) for the
foreseeable future. This view of the United States as the primary
adversary has increased since the 2022 invasion. Russian political and
military leaders assess that Russia's struggles in Ukraine have been
largely due to aid from the United States and the broader NATO alliance,
which Rus-sian leaders interpret as direct participation in the war.20

## I/L\-\--Arctic Key

### Arctic Key\-\--General\-\--2NC

#### The Arctic is [central]{.underline} to Russia's [identity]{.underline}.

The United States and most Americans don\'t identify, as an Arctic
nation. We don\'t tend to think of ourselves as part of the Arctic in
this country. It\'s very far away from most Americans lived experience.

In Russia, by contrast, [the]{.underline} Russian [**Arctic** identity
is a **central part** of Russia\'s sense of **place** and]{.underline}
sense of [self]{.underline}. [It\'s an **enormous** point of
**pride**]{.underline} to Russians that they have a huge Arctic
territory, [that they have advanced]{.underline} Arctic
[capabilities]{.underline}, [that that the Arctic is sort of a **core
part** of their]{.underline} place in the **[world]{.underline}**. And
so that means that for Russia, [their **strategic**
calculus]{.underline} around the Arctic [is **bigger** than
just]{.underline} a **[military]{.underline}**-economic calculus. And it
also means that [when]{.underline} President [**Putin** directs
activities]{.underline} in the Arctic, whether it\'s construction or
military exercises, [he\'s got an **eye** on the **domestic
audience**]{.underline} and the domestic political effects of those
moves more or perhaps equal to the practical effects. 

So, for example, when you see something like [a **flag planting** at the
North Pole]{.underline} in 2007, or you see Russian [**paratroopers
dropping** onto the ice]{.underline} at the North Pole or Russian
[**scientists unfurling** a giant]{.underline} Russian
[flag]{.underline} across the ice, yes, [that\'s
**signaling**]{.underline} to the United States and NATO, but it\'s also
signaling to the Russian people that [that Russia is an Arctic
state]{.underline}, that we are strong and proud in the Arctic [and that
has a really **important**]{.underline} domestic [political **benefit**
for Putin]{.underline}, particularly [at a moment like
today]{.underline}, [where Russia is is **weak** and
**challenged**]{.underline} on many fronts, [pointing to the **Arctic**
as a **source** of **strength**]{.underline}, an area of of
[**dominance** and **power**]{.underline} and capabilities is, is really
one of the sort of trump cards that that Putin can still play.

#### US and allies encroaching on Russian dominance of the Arctic creates fears of encirclement\-\--militarization, competition for finite resources, and increased activity from non-Arctic states

[[Informed by **historical** fears of **encirclement** and
**invasion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and distrustful of the West, [[Moscow
believes that its Arctic interests are **under**
**threat**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russian thinkers, particularly those
who focus on [military]{.underline} strategy and operations, tend to
overlay their historical fears about the rapacity of foreign nations
onto Arctic security issues. Western policymakers may find those fears
misplaced, but [they are nonetheless [**honestly** held beliefs among
**many** in the Russian **security** **community**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, a common dynamic in debates over Arctic security is a belief on
both sides that their own nation\'s ambitions are quite modest, while
the other\'s is overly aggressive.^23^

Of course, Arctic security issues are unfolding in the West against a
backdrop of often-illegal and sometimes-messy Russian operations
against [U.S.]{.underline} diplomats in Cuba and China, an ugly Russian
assassination campaign against perceived enemies at home and abroad, and
Russian election interference in several Western democracies.
[[**Moscow\'s** complicity in conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine also
affect Western decisions in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russian
writers prefer instead to view these conflicts in isolation, and as
instigated by the United States. In any case, such illegal activities
are also evidence that Russia prefers asymmetric and indirect campaigns
against the West, not direct military confrontation.

A [[**broad** Russian **consensus** on threats in the Arctic focuses on
fear of **military** **domination**]{.mark}, [threats to **natural**
**resources**, and risk to **strategic** **military**
force]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}. [These threat perceptions exist
across [a range of defense thinkers, government officials, and even some
academics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Specifically, Russian fears center on
concerns [over regional air and naval domination, as well as the
vulnerability of critical economic and military resources to theft or
destruction.]{.underline}^24^

Even anodyne U.S. statements can provoke a defensive response in
official circles in Russia. Replying to U.S. Vice Admiral Andrew Lewis'
2020 statement that his fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes of
communication in the Atlantic and Arctic, Yury Shvytkin, a Russian Duma
member, argued that, "The statement looks adventurous in relation to our
country. The United States should be advised not to tempt fate in trying
to realize this kind of scenario. The Northern Sea Route and the Arctic,
of course, are our country\'s responsibility, and are where Russian
national interests are present."^28^

Non-Arctic NATO state military deployments, though rare, are also a
particular running concern.^29^ For example, when U.S. and British
warships deployed to the [Barents Sea]{.underline} in May 2020 for the
first time since the [Cold War]{.underline}, Russia\'s
Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic Cooperation Nikolai Korchunov noted:

[We are [concerned about the **growing** **activity** of the North
Atlantic Alliance in the Arctic]{.mark}.... We are particularly
concerned about the [increased activity in the Arctic of non-Arctic
states]{.mark}, NATO member countries]{.underline}. We believe that
[this leads to tension, it [**undermines** the preservation of the
region as a zone of **peace**, **stability**, and constructive
**interaction**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}[^30^]{.mark}

[As slow-motion escalation continues to spiral upward in the Arctic,
with [U.S. and NATO military activity **increasing** in response to
Russia\'s own military buildup]{.mark}, [Russian fears]{.mark} of
military domination there only
[increase.]{.mark}]{.underline}[^[31]{.underline}^]{.mark}

Russian observers also argue that the opening of the Arctic has resulted
in an ["[**intensifying** **competition**" for finite resources and that
this competition will only sharpen in the future]{.mark},]{.underline}
despite calls for comity and cooperation.^34^ In this regard, they view
energy resources as particularly salient. For example, in 2010, Major
General Vassily Sosnin called out "the strategic nature [of [U.S.
**intentions** to build up its power in the
hydrocarbon-rich territory and seas of the Arctic Ocean." Likely
referring to the results of studies designed to **determine** the
**limits** of the **extended** **continental**
**shelf**]{.underline}]{.mark}, he wrote, "There is [[a plainly visible
dangerous trend to increasingly ignore the results of science research
in deciding on the ownership of Arctic **natural**
**resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than relying on science
alone, states are increasingly engaged in a fight for
the Arctic\'s [natural resources]{.underline}."^35^

These concerns about natural resources are articulated at high official
levels, not merely confined to hawks among individual military officers
or Russia\'s think tank community. In 2018, Minister of Defense Sergei
Shoigu stated, "The Arctic has become an object of territorial,
resource, and military-strategic interests of a number of states. This
can lead to an increase in the conflict potential in this
region."^36^ Russia\'s *Naval Fundamentals* also notes "the increased
aspirations of a range of states to own sources of hydrocarbon energy
resources in the Near East, the Arctic, and the [Caspian
Sea]{.underline} basin."^37^ Given the importance that Russia has
ascribed to its Arctic natural resources, this is perceived as a threat
aimed at the heart of Russian well-being.

Arguably most critical for Moscow is ensuring the survivability of its
strategic nuclear and general-purpose naval forces. Russian concerns
about protecting its strategic nuclear triad are
well-studied.^39^ [[U.S. **strikes** from the **Arctic**]{.mark}, as
Alexander Khramchikhin, deputy director of the Institute for Political
and Military Analysis has put it, "[Will allow the **destruction** of a
significant part of Russian ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines, and
bombers]{.mark}, and without a global environmental
catastrophe."]{.underline}[^40^ The [Russian **priority** to **protect**
these forces]{.mark} survived the collapse of the Soviet Union intact
and [**continues** to receive **heavy**
**emphasis**]{.mark}.]{.underline}^[41]{.underline}^ More recently, the
Russian Navy has also accrued a newer mission designed to contribute to
strategic operations that provide conventional deterrence and escalation
control via strikes on adversary critical infrastructure, making the
survivability of Northern Fleet\'s limited stable of
nuclear-powered [cruise missile]{.underline} submarines almost as
essential as its ballistic missile submarines.^42^ Thus, the priority to
secure the Northern Fleet\'s nuclear and non-nuclear military
capabilities has increased in the post-Soviet period.

Russia's Arctic Intentions

[Russia considers the Arctic its **number one maritime
priority**]{.underline}, surpassing the Atlantic, Former U.S. 2nd Fleet
commander Vice Adm. Dan Dwyer said during a Navy League conference last
year.

[Moscow is]{.underline}, "[prioritizing the Arctic as its most important
maritime direction]{.underline}, [pledging to **protect these waters**
'by all means]{.underline}.' This includes increasing attention on the
Arctic littorals as well as the introduction of new missile
capabilities," he said.

[That includes operating six]{.underline} dual-use military
**[bases]{.underline}**, [a dozen **airfields** and a fleet
of]{.underline} at least [40 **icebreakers**]{.underline}.

[The emphasis]{.underline} on the Arctic [is **not only military**
but]{.underline} increasingly [economic]{.underline}, experts have told
USNI News.

[Moscow sees the Arctic as a strategic source of **energy** and
**natural resources**]{.underline}, and the Kremlin wants to continue
its scientific research in the area, Senior Associate at the Arctic
Institute Pavel Devyatkin recently told USNI News last week.

[Russia also wants to manage the **N**]{.underline}orthern
**[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute's shipping lanes [and
protect]{.underline} both [its economic and **security
interests**]{.underline} in the region through military presence.
Recently, Moscow added a fifth component about the Indigenous people in
the region.

Russia's military presence in the Arctic peaked during the Soviet era
and [new increases to **defense spending** have **expanded
operations**]{.underline} in the region, though it's still far below the
Cold War peak, Devyatkin said.

[Russia's stance]{.underline} on the Arctic, in terms of its 2023
defense strategy, [is more **domestic** rather than valuing
international cooperation]{.underline}, Devyatkin wrote in a co-authored
with Nikita Lipunov piece for the Arctic Institute.

Last year Russia revised its Arctic 2035 policy taking a page out of
China's South China Sea playbook. In the 2023 revision to Arctic 2025[,
the Kremlin **emphasized** its own national **interest**]{.underline} in
the region and rather than working with the Arctic Council, it would
instead deal with nations bilaterally.

This comes as the other [**Arctic nations** have shied **away** from
**working** with Moscow in **protest** of its invasion]{.underline} into
Ukraine. While Russia is still a member of councils that focus on
economic concerns in the Arctic, Russia was not invited to the last two
meetings of the Arctic defense chiefs.

Instead, Russia is looking to non-Artic partners, like China, Devyatkin
said.

"[The Arctic is a **sensitive region for Russia** as it is critical to
Russia's **economic outlook**]{.underline}. [The loss of Western markets
and partners has created **significant problems** for Arctic energy
projects]{.underline}, but Russia will continue to make major
investments in the region (led by some of the country's largest
companies) and is confident in the viability of these projects over the
long term," he said in an email to USNI News.

[The Russo-**Ukrainian War** might lead Russian to put more **emphasis**
on its **Northern Fleet**]{.underline}, according to an article in
scientific journal *Polar Science*. [The **Black Sea
Fleet**]{.underline}, which [sustained major attacks]{.underline} from
Ukrainian forces, is essentially stuck in the Black Sea, while [Moscow's
**Baltic Fleet** is]{.underline} now [surrounded by]{.underline} mostly
[NATO]{.underline} countries.

"Based on the Kola Peninsula in the European Arctic, [the Northern Fleet
is the **only** Europe-based Russian **fleet** with **direct access** to
the]{.underline} Atlantic Ocean -- and thus to the **[world's
oceans]{.underline}**," reads the article, which notes that the Northern
Fleet holds almost all of Russia's nuclear submarines.

[Arctic countries want to **keep tension low** in the
region]{.underline}, Gylfadóttir said, but they also have to be prepared
for more chances of miscalculation or misunderstandings that could
result in military action.

This is not the case for Russia or China. [Russia **suffers**
from]{.underline} what Hill and Gaddy call [the **Siberian
Curse**]{.underline}. [Its geography is not]{.underline} as
[economically favorable]{.underline} as America's, [which has **forced**
it to turn **towards the Arctic**]{.underline} to improve its economic
circumstances. However, it has also traditionally operated a
state-controlled economy that uses slave labor and nationally owned
corporations to mask the economic, environmental and demographic costs
of operating in the Arctic. [Beginning with the **czars**]{.underline},
and accelerating under Russia's Soviet dictators, [Russia forcibly
**sent millions** of people to develop and "**conquer the
Arctic**."]{.underline}

[This legacy continues today as **Putin**]{.underline} pushes and
[**subsidizes** Russia's]{.underline} economic [**ministries**
and]{.underline} state-controlled [**corporations** to extract more
resources]{.underline} from the Arctic [and to **expand** the
infrastructure of the **N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[R]{.underline}**oute (with the numerous powerful icebreakers needed
to navigate this waterway) to transport these resources to distant
markets. Unlike American corporations, Russia's economic pursuits in the
Arctic are not concerned
with environmenta[l]{.underline} or indigenous considerations either.
Furthermore, [Russia's **extreme sacrifices**]{.underline} in the Arctic
[have made **developing** and controlling it **symbolic** for its
**people** and leadership]{.underline}. As such, [Russia has much more
to defend **materially** and **ideationally**]{.underline} in the Arctic
than the US does. Even with these factors pushing Russia to conquer the
Arctic, [Russia's]{.underline} regional [**ambitions** have been
**challenged**]{.underline} by fiscal, demographic, and environmental
hurdles. Most recently, [the **war in Ukraine** has forced it to curtail
its ambitious Arctic railway and icebreaker projects]{.underline} and to
[mobilize]{.underline} and sacrifice [a significant proportion of
its]{.underline} Arctic [troops]{.underline} for combat in Ukraine.
Additionally, many of its Arctic cities have rapidly de-populated, [and
the Arctic melt has]{.underline} paradoxically
[threatened its]{.underline} existing Arctic
**[infrastructure]{.underline}**.

Despite recent delays large-scale [**Arctic projects** will remain a
**key driver** of Russia's **economy** in the future]{.underline}, new
government data show.

[The]{.underline} Russian [government expects resource **development**
in the region to **contribute** in excess of **\$160bn in tax
revenue**]{.underline} to the federal budget over the next decade to
2035. 

[Western **sanctions** have halted or **slowed down** a number of
projects]{.underline} along the Northern Sea Route -- namely Arctic LNG
2 and Vostok Oil -- [but **existing** projects including **Yamal LNG**
and the **Arctic Gate oil** terminal already provide]{.underline}
substantial **[revenues]{.underline}**.

And major Russian businesses Novatek, Gazprom, Rosneft, Norils Nickel,
and Lukoil all appear poised to continue their push into the Arctic. 

A key region for Russia's GDP

The region already contributes significantly to Russia's Gross domestic
product (GDP) and exports. [In 2024 the Arctic generated **11 percent of
exports** and accounted for **7.5 percent** of the country's
**GDP**]{.underline}. Those figures are likely to increase in the coming
years.

In comparison the state of Alaska accounts for only 0.3 percent of U.S.
GDP. In neighboring Canada that figure is 0.5 percent for the three
northern territories.

\"[The Arctic]{.underline} is a geostrategic territory on a global
scale. It [is one of the **key economic engines** of Russia\'s
development]{.underline}," said Alexey Chekunkov, Minister for the
Development of the Far East and the Arctic, in remarks last week.

Earmarked investments

"As the projects that have already begun are implemented, the importance
of the Arctic in the economy, logistics and national security of Russia
will only increase," he continued.

[Russia has earmarked **investments of \$40bn** over the next
decade]{.underline} to create an economic environment to ensure
implementation of all proposed projects. 

If the government can meet those significant financial investments,
however, remains to be seen.

President Putin's lofty goals of reaching 80 million tons of cargo along
the route by 2024 did not materialize, with the total tonnage only
coming in at slightly less than half of that figure last year.

"The government's central task is to ensure such conditions for the life
and work of people in the Arctic that all plans for the development of
the macro-region come true," Chekunkov concluded.

Shipping generates revenue

[The development of **infrastructure** along the
**N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute,
[including **ports** and]{.underline} nuclear-powered
**[icebreakers]{.underline}** ensuring year-round access, [will be
**key**]{.underline} to implementing the economic plan.

Russia recently commissioned its eighth nuclear icebreaker, the largest
fleet it has ever operated, exceeding previous records set during the
height of the Cold War. By 2030 the fleet is set to encompass ten
vessels. 

Shipping traffic associated with [**oil** and **l**]{.underline}iquefied
**[n]{.underline}**atural **[g]{.underline}**as projects along the
Northern Sea Route [also generates **substantial revenue**]{.underline}
for Rosatomflot, operator of the country's nuclear icebreaker fleet.

High fees

[Fees for]{.underline} large oil [tankers and]{.underline} LNG [carriers
can reach between \$300,000 -- **\$700,000 for a single
escort**]{.underline}, depending on the size of the vessel, the distance
traveled and the time of year. In 2024 Atomflot provided escorts to 976
vessels.

A standard delivery of supercooled gas from the existing Yamal LNG plant
racks up icebreaker fees of around \$400,000.

[Out of a total of 287 shipments]{.underline} in 2024, at least [120
required]{.underline} icebreaker [escorts]{.underline} between the
months of December and May, likely **[generating]{.underline}** in
excess of **[\$50m]{.underline}** for Atomflot.

How exactly Western shipping owners and operators of the LNG carriers
provide payment to Atomflot is unknown; the Russian state-owned entity
has been under sanctions since May 2023.

Trade routes and resources

The presence of [ice does not mean the Arctic is
unnavigable]{.underline}. **[Trade exists]{.underline}**, though on a
smaller scale than in other parts of the world, and it requires a
special class of escort vessels---icebreakers. Here, [**Russia** is the
**undisputed leader**]{.underline}. According to Russia's Transport
Ministry, the country operates 41 icebreakers, including seven
nuclear-powered ones---the only nation in the world with such a fleet.
In contrast, the US, Canada, and European nations each have only a
handful.

[This **dominance** has **allowed** Russia to control the
**N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute.
Since Arctic navigation largely depends on Russian icebreakers, [Moscow
**profits** by charging]{.underline} commercial **[fees]{.underline}**
for their use.

At the same time, this [gives Russia a **crucial strategic
advantage**]{.underline}. [The Kremlin retains the **power** to
**dictate** Arctic trade **flows**]{.underline}. Icebreakers also
operate alongside Russia's naval forces, ensuring military operations
can be sustained in the region. Unsurprisingly, Russia's partner nations
are now investing in their own icebreaker fleets rather than relying
solely on their so-called "ally."

[Russia's]{.underline} Arctic **[ambitions]{.underline}** also [serve as
a tool for **circumventing**]{.underline} Western
**[sanctions]{.underline}**. By controlling this trade corridor, Moscow
can continue exporting resources to Asia, bypassing restrictions.

Russia's claim to Arctic dominance is further reflected in its
territorial ambitions. While international agreements designate
territorial waters up to 12 miles (22 km) from the coast and exclusive
economic zones up to 200 miles (370 km), Russia has spent years trying
to expand its claim. Moscow argues that the Lomonosov and Mendeleev
Ridges are extensions of its continental shelf, thereby asserting rights
over an additional 463,000 square miles (1.2 million km²)---including
the North Pole.

[At stake are **22%** of the world's **untapped** oil and gas
**reserves**]{.underline}. For Russia, [gaining control]{.underline} of
these resources [represents another **opportunity** to
generate]{.underline} massive **[revenue]{.underline}**. In the past
three years alone, [Russia has **earned** over **\$800 billion** from
Arctic resource **extraction**]{.underline}. The full-scale war against
Ukraine has already demonstrated how the Kremlin exploits energy
resources for blackmail and economic destabilization, particularly in
Europe. Moreover, Moscow has decades of experience extracting oil in
Arctic conditions.

If Russia succeeds in expanding its territorial claims, it will gain
unchecked control over the Arctic. It would hold the power to regulate
trade routes, impose blockades, and covertly deploy military forces for
future conflicts.

Economic insecurity

[The second **insecurity** shaping Russia's]{.underline} Arctic
[**policy** is over the]{.underline} perceived [**threat** to its
ability to]{.underline} safely and effectively [extract **oil** and
**gas**]{.underline}. Russian officials frequently cite that around
[**80%** of]{.underline} the country's [natural **gas** and **17%**
of]{.underline} its [**oil** reserves are located within the **Russian
Arctic zone**]{.underline}. The Kremlin has even dubbed the Arctic as
its "resource base of the 21st century". However, over
[**two-thirds** of these reserves]{.underline}---particularly those
located offshore---[are **hard-to-cover** and inaccessible]{.underline}
due to technological limitations. At the same time, fields with more
accessible extraction---mostly located in other regions of
Russia---are gradually being depleted.

[For a country that **relies** on oil and gas for **20% of its
GDP**]{.underline}, [this is an **existential issue**]{.underline}.  In
response, Russian state companies actively sought partnerships with
international firms to develop Arctic projects---fully aware of their
dependence on foreign technology and despite tightening regulations on
foreign investment in the Arctic. [One]{.underline} frequently
highlighted [success story was the **cooperation** between **Rosneft**
and **ExxonMobil**]{.underline} in the Kara Sea, which gave Russia
access to technologies for deepwater drilling. This collaboration was
widely publicised in Russia, along with Putin's personal involvement, as
a major strategic win.

[That]{.underline} trajectory [**changed dramatically** in 2014 when
the **US** and the **EU** imposed **sanctions** on Russia]{.underline}
after its illegal annexation of Crimea. These included restrictions on
the export of technologies and equipment critical for Arctic resource
development, effectively stopping or delaying parts of Russian Arctic
projects and shutting down joint ventures like the one with ExxonMobil.
[The **sanctions** were a]{.underline} targeted [**blow** to Russia's
**ability** to develop energy reserves]{.underline}, a move which the
Kremlin saw as "clearly aggressive". In the aftermath, a sense of
strategic vulnerability and paranoia intensified among Russian
officials, built on the idea that the West is pursuing a policy of
taking Russia's natural resources.

bloodshed]{.underline}, writes Mark Beeson.

THERE'S NOTHING quite like a real-world test of a theoretical
proposition to instil confidence in the conventional wisdom.
Unfortunately, if it's the credibility of nuclear weapons as the
ultimate form of deterrence that's in question, not many of us are
likely to be around if the assumption proves unfounded.

What [we do know]{.underline} is [that **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s have
no capacity to deter]{.mark} conventional [wars]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**[even if]{.mark}** we **assume** that nuclear
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} might [**[think twice]{.mark}** about
getting into a fight with similarly equipped rivals]{.underline}. We
also know that [[wars]{.mark} are [**easy to start** and]{.mark} very
**[difficult to stop]{.mark},**]{.underline} much less "win" in an
unambiguously convincing fashion.

The Vietnam War -- or the "American War" as the Vietnamese
understandably call it -- lasted for 13 years and led to the U.S.'s
humiliating exit from Southeast Asia. Even though Vietnam undoubtedly
"won" the conflict, some 2-3 million Vietnamese died in the process. To
underline the pointlessness of all this carnage, Vietnam is now seen by
many grand strategists as a potentially useful ally against China ---
the new existential threat to democracy, American primacy and much else.

**[[Pointless]{.mark}, [avoidable]{.mark} blood-soaked
[tragedies]{.mark} never go out of fashion]{.underline}**, it seems. One
might have thought that we would have learned some useful lessons from
the "war to end all wars" -- World War 1 -- or the increasingly
fashionable, increasingly futile "wars of choice" that have been
undertaken by the Americans in particular.

It is not simply the fact that such [[conflicts]{.mark}
[encourage]{.mark} other [leaders]{.mark} keen [to use]{.mark} their
[military might to]{.mark} try and violently [solve]{.mark}
[complex]{.mark}, historically embedded political
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline} [that undermines confidence in deterrence
theory.]{.underline} On the contrary, even [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [are re-entering the lexicon]{.underline} [of great
power posturing and even war gaming]{.underline}, no doubt, [as leaders
try to [convince]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[counterparts]{.underline}]{.mark} elsewhere that [[they aren't
bluffing]{.mark} about their possible use]{.underline}.

The **[most consequential example]{.underline}** of this possibility at
present [is]{.underline} in **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where
Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} is [threatening to use
"tactical" nuclear weapons]{.underline} in the increasingly unlikely
event that outside powers intervene or that he looks like losing the
war.

[Part of what makes such threats credible is]{.underline} what Hugh
White, one of Australia's most prominent strategic commentators,
calls '[the balance of resolve']{.underline}; in this case, [the belief
that Putin is willing to risk an apocalyptic conflict and use nuclear
weapons against equally powerful opponents]{.underline}.

White argues that:

Any international order is defined ultimately by the issues on which the
strongest powers -- the great powers -- can convince one another they
are willing to go to war with one another over.'

He may be correct that [this has been the **case for the last couple of
hundred years**]{.underline}, or even the last couple of thousand,
according to some "realist" thinkers, [but that **doesn't make it** a
**desirable** condition]{.underline}. Hopefully, it doesn't make it
inevitable either, despite what the realist strategists may tell us.
Indeed, we must hope they are wrong because [**[strategic]{.mark}
[standoffs]{.mark}** [**don't**]{.mark} usually **[end
well]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [peaceful disappearance]{.underline}
[of the Soviet Union may be a historical aberration]{.underline} in this
regard and one that [Putin is determined to avenge.]{.underline}

Given the consequences of what is euphemistically described by strategic
thinkers as a "nuclear exchange", we might expect that logic that
underpins such possibilities might be subject to more rigorous
examination and debate. But as is generally the way with military
matters and grand strategising, such issues are the preserve of
a coterie of specialists who seem immune to external influence or the
worries of mere mortals.

But one question we might usefully ask is: [**if nuclear weapons are
such decisive deterrents, why doesn't** everyone have one? Why shouldn't
**[Iran]{.mark} have one**]{.underline}, to take a topical example, [as
that might have deterred the Israelis from launching]{.underline} yet
another assault on one of their neighbours.

[If the right to have nuclear weapons is judged on behaviour and
historical body counts, [Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}, under Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu[, is surely the last country that ought to
have any]{.underline} [because it is clearly the most likely to use
them.]{.underline} If Israel under his leadership is determined to stop
Iran getting one, a nuclear weapon ought to do the trick, no matter how
deeply buried Iran's bomb building facilities are.

No doubt, there are quite a few people who would think this was no bad
outcome, and well worth all the collateral damage being inflicted on
Iran's already impoverished people and infrastructure. Serves the
Iranian people right for not rising up and overthrowing an anachronistic
theocracy, no doubt. And yet, Netanyahu is also a reminder that
[**[unscrupulous]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark}** who **[use war]{.mark}** and
hatred **[to maintain]{.mark} [power]{.mark}** can appear anywhere and
prove [difficult to get rid of]{.mark}, too]{.underline}. 

For those countries that don't have nukes, these debates can seem a bit
detached from reality and something we can't really influence. But that
hasn't stopped our [own hardheaded realists]{.underline} from
[urging]{.underline} us [to]{.underline} [get ready to 'strengthen U.S.
extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline} and be ready to support nuclear
operations to restore deterrence should it fail'.

[Quite [how you restore deterrence when]{.mark} [you've]{.mark} just
**[vaporised]{.mark}** large numbers of [the]{.mark} purported
[enemy]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an open question]{.underline}. Probably
[**[not the moment]{.mark}** for a **[rational calculation]{.mark} of
strategic options**]{.underline}, though. ["**Use them or lose
them"**]{.underline} might be the order of the day.

#### Improving U.S missile defenses creates a [destabilizing]{.underline} cycle of [arms race]{.underline}.

MISSILE DEFENSE AND NON-STRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS

[[Russia]{.mark}n officials have long expressed **[concern]{.mark}s**
[about]{.mark} U.S. **[missile defense]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which is
intended to counter threats from North Korean and Iranian
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) but [which]{.underline}
[Russia]{.underline} and China [[believe]{.mark} **[hinders]{.mark}**
their own **[deterrence]{.mark}** capabilities, thereby
[upsetting]{.mark} the **strategic [balance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Highlighting these long-standing Russian concerns about the intent of
U.S. missile defenses, former U.S. president Donald [Trump]{.underline}
has [remarked]{.underline}, "[Our goal is simple: to ensure that we can
detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States ---
anywhere, anytime, anyplace]{.underline}." Furthermore, during the
course of the Track 2 dialogue, the United States successfully
intercepted a test ICBM using the Aegis Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block
IIA ship-to-missile technology---which, Russian participants noted,
underscored and reinforced their concerns.

[Russia]{.underline}n participants [noted that their recent advances in
hypersonic guided cruise missiles]{.underline}---which U.S. participants
noted with great concern---[were a result of the U.S. withdrawal
from]{.underline} the Anti-Ballistic Missile ([ABM) Treaty]{.underline},
leading Moscow to attempt to counter ABM systems and remain at strategic
parity with the United States. Because of these developments in
hypersonic technology, U.S. participants wondered whether missile
defense was still a concern for Moscow.

[In response, Russia]{.underline}n participants [maintained that U.S.
missile defense systems remain **destabilizing** [due to
**uncertainty**]{.mark} regarding their efficacy against Russian
strategic systems]{.underline}. [In its [current form,]{.mark} U.S.
[missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} be
able to [[upset]{.mark} the strategic [balance]{.mark}, but its
potential for **[improvement]{.mark}** is a major **concern**
for]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n arms control community.
Progress in bilateral arms control will likely require addressing the
growing technological capabilities of both the [United States and
Russia]{.underline} in order to avoid a [**[destabiliz]{.mark}ing
[cycle]{.mark}** in which [Russia]{.mark} [develops]{.mark} new
**[offensive systems]{.mark}** designed to defeat U.S. missile defenses,
compelling the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to [develop]{.mark}
**greater**]{.underline} global missile [[defense
**capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Deterrence renews a U.S/Russia nuclear arms race\-\--security dilemma enhances tensions.

**Ziegler '21** \[Charles; 2021; Political Scientist Professor at
University of Louisville, Author on Foreign Policy Works; "A Crisis of
Diverging Perspectives: U.S.-Russian Relations and the Security
Dilemma",
https://tnsr.org/2020/11/a-crisis-of-diverging-perspectives-u-s-russian-relations-and-the-security-dilemma/\]

While each side bears some responsibility for the poor state of
relations, I argue that [much of the [U.S.-Russian relationship]{.mark}
constitutes [a **security dilemma**]{.mark}, in which defensive actions
undertaken by one side increase the other's insecurity]{.underline}.
Russia and the United States are arguably defensive realist powers, yet
few studies have analyzed the relationship as a security dilemma. The
[erosion of American hegemony, decline of international institutions,
rejection of arms control agreements, and return of great-power
rivalry]{.underline} all [[contribute to]{.mark} heightened
**[uncertainties]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} increased potential for
conflict]{.underline}. In short, the strategic spiral model would seem
appropriate to this confrontational dynamic. [Each side is fearful of
the other's intentions, neither understands the security imperatives of
their rival, and both engage in behavior that undermines the security of
the other]{.underline}. Domestic political vulnerabilities contribute to
international tensions, while contrasting geopolitical perspectives are
a critical contextual factor shaping the security dilemma. These
[internal vulnerabilities and differing perspectives serve to **heighten
[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is then [[manifest]{.mark}ed
in exaggerated reactions to alliance expansion, a [renewed **nuclear
arms race**]{.mark} to overcome missile defenses, and efforts to
interfere in the other's domestic politics.]{.underline} While the
Russian Federation is significantly different from the Soviet Union,
determinants of great-power interaction remain relevant for
understanding the dynamic between the two countries. War is a real
possibility, but the two sides may find opportunities for cooperation
and manage to avoid military conflict.

[I first briefly sketch out]{.underline} the [main arguments
of]{.underline} the [rival explanations for]{.underline} the
[**deterioration** in U.S.-Russian **relations**, then present the case
for a security dilemma approach that develops the role of geography,
conflicting norms, and insecurity.]{.underline} The next section
outlines Russian reactions to U.S. security initiatives, followed by
U.S. reactions to Russia's security initiatives. The subsequent two
sections examine how asymmetric geographic positions and alliance
politics contribute to the security dilemma. The conclusion evaluates
the utility of the security dilemma approach and briefly considers the
prospects for improving U.S.-Russian relations.

Assessing Rival Explanations

[Blaming Russia for the breakdown in U.S.-Russian relations has been
popular among American]{.underline} politician[s]{.underline} across the
political spectrum --- including, the late John McCain, Hillary Clinton,
and John Bolton, among others. A number of foreign policy and Russia
specialists have also focused on Russian actions as responsible for the
downturn. They cite Putin's confrontational Munich speech of 2007, the
Russo-Georgian War of 2008, the Kremlin's annexation of Crimea and
destabilizing involvement in southeastern Ukraine, the Sergei Skripal
poisoning, murders of Russian journalists, informational warfare, and
interference in the 2016 presidential elections as evidence that Russia
is fundamentally revisionist, hostile, and aggressive toward the United
States.

Some observers suggest Russian military action in Georgia and Ukraine
provide proof that Putin is attempting to reestablish the czarist or
Soviet empire.3 Putin's 2005 statement that the collapse of the Soviet
Union was "a major geopolitical disaster of the century" is taken as an
indication that his goal is to reconstitute a Russian empire, or at
least restore hegemony over neighboring states. Agnia Grigas argues that
Russian foreign policy has increasingly sought to restore influence over
the former Soviet space, especially those territories that are home to
large numbers of Russian compatriots, in a form of "reimperialization."4
Ingmar Oldberg agrees that Russia's aggressive actions in the
Commonwealth of Independent States region, its hostile information
offensive against Europe, its domestic militarism, and its ambitions in
the Middle East and Arctic are evidence that Russia is a revisionist,
not a status quo, power.5

Other critics are more measured. Michael McFaul, for example,
acknowledges the Russian claim that after the Cold War the United States
took advantage of Russia's weakness to expand NATO, bomb Serbia, invade
Iraq, and provide assistance to Georgia and Ukraine. But he asserts "it
is revisionism to argue that \[the United States\] did not embrace
Moscow's new leaders."6 The United States and its NATO allies, according
to this interpretation, provided well-intentioned support for Russia's
transition away from communism, but Putin rejected a Western-dominated
liberal order in favor of nationalist authoritarianism at home and
revisionist adventurism abroad. Stephen Sestanovich assesses NATO's
expansion as a means to improve stability and advance American influence
but dismisses Russian charges that Washington sought to militarize the
continent. Dramatic reductions in U.S. and NATO forces deployed in
Europe and the significant reductions in defense expenditures, he
suggests, refute Moscow's claims of Western aggressive intentions.7

If [**[Russia]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed
[**[defensive]{.mark}** and]{.underline} simply [[reacting to
**perceived threats** from]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
and its allies, then we should expect Moscow to react only to U.S.
provocations in its perceived sphere of interests and to develop only
sufficient military capabilities to deter the United States and its
allies.]{.underline} However, this expectation is only partially
supported.

If Russia is indeed aggressive and expansionist, then we should expect
Moscow to take advantage of most, if not all, opportunities to
reestablish Russian hegemony in the former Soviet space and to build up
military capabilities in excess of what is necessary to deter the United
States and its NATO allies. But as we shall see, Russia has only
partially followed this scenario. In policy terms, the United States
would in turn respond with a show of military force and work with its
allies to impose painful sanctions and condemn Russia in various
international forums. This, in essence, is the approach that Washington
has been following since 2014.

A second explanation places more of the blame on the United States.
Stephen F. Cohen has argued that the media and much of the
[[Washington]{.mark} establishment have [demonized Putin]{.mark} and
**exaggerated** the **authoritarian** aspects]{.underline} of Russia's
political system.8 Similarly, Dimitri Simes notes that the United States
humiliated Russia after the Cold War by treating it as a defeated state,
slighting Russia's national interests while ignoring the context and
historical background behind Russian actions.9 Daniel Deudney and G.
John Ikenberry place [much of the blame for U.S.-Russian antagonism on
ill-considered American policies that rejected the restraint
exercised]{.underline} during the late Cold War in favor of a foreign
policy [that ignored Russian interests]{.underline}. The expansion of
NATO, the U.S. withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
together with the decision to deploy anti-missile systems, and disputes
over pipeline routes from the Caspian region all violated the spirit of
the Cold War settlement.10

Arguments that [NATO's eastward expansion]{.underline} and the 1999
intervention in Kosovo [**threatened Russian security** and were
responsible for much of the downturn in bilateral relations echo
official Russian statements]{.underline}.11 John Mearsheimer, a leading
realist scholar of international relations, suggests the [Ukraine crisis
is the West's fault: Any great power, faced with the expansion of a
military bloc toward its borders, would react as Russia
did]{.underline}.12 As early as the mid-1990s, Michael Brown warned that
admitting Eastern European nations to the alliance would be
counterproductive, boosting radical nationalists and opportunists in
Russia who would undermine chances for democracy and push the country
toward more aggressive policies.13 George Kennan, the father of
containment, described NATO expansion as a "tragic mistake" and the
"beginning of a new cold war."14

Drawing on newly released archival materials, recent scholarship finds
that NATO enlargement in the Clinton administration, while facilitated
by Russian "missteps" (including extensive corruption and the first
Chechen War), resulted more from pressure by the Central and Eastern
European states and "above all" from the 1994 Republican midterm
electoral victory than any military imperative.15 Joshua Shifrinson
demonstrates that during the German reunification negotiations the
[United States repeatedly offered Russia informal assurances NATO would
not expand into Eastern Europe [and]{.mark} then **[exploited]{.mark}
Russian [weakness]{.mark}** to do just that]{.underline}.16

If Russia is indeed defensive and simply reacting to perceived threats
from the United States and its allies, then [we should [expect Moscow to
react]{.mark} only [to U.S. provocations]{.mark} in its perceived sphere
of interests and to develop only sufficient military capabilities to
**deter** the United States and its allies]{.underline}. However, this
expectation is only partially supported. The logical implications of
this perspective are that a more nuanced approach acknowledging Russia
as a great power with valid security concerns, especially in the former
Soviet space, would ease tensions. Russian pride and honor make Kremlin
leaders acutely sensitive to American actions that constrain its
international status, while Washington's anti-Russia lobby promotes fear
of Russia far out of proportion to any objective threat.17

The Security Dilemma Argument

[Realism holds **uncertainty** to be a fundamental condition of the
international system]{.underline}, a condition that, contrary to the
expectations of global optimists, was not resolved with the end of the
Cold War. This [uncertainty and attempts by states to alleviate threats
through various measures lead to the security dilemma.]{.underline}18
[Decision-makers can never fully understand the plans and intentions of
the other side]{.underline} (the "other minds" problem), nor can they
predict how weapons might be used against them, since few weapons
systems are purely offensive or defensive. [Each state, in enhancing its
power, increases the insecurity of its rival.]{.underline}19 A security
dilemma interpretation of Russian-American relations is not solely an
argument for a "blame-free" analysis, and it does not enlighten every
facet of the relationship, but it does direct our attention toward
distinct perceptual variables that shape policy. As Robert Jervis
observed, [**[psychological factors]{.mark}** play a major role in the
security dilemma, with perceptions and misperceptions
[contribut]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} a [**spiral** of mutual
**hostility**]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[lead]{.mark}ing [to
**war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 States may develop hostile images of
each other, which was clearly evident throughout the Cold War and has
been the case over the past decade or more of Russian-American
relations.21 Under these conditions, a power imbalance on one side fuels
insecurity on the other. Arms buildups and modernization programs are
interpreted as aggressive rather than defensive behavior, while similar
behavior on the part of the self is held to be benign.22

[The **complexity** of Russian-American ties leads both sides to misread
each other's intentions and overreact to potential threats]{.underline}.
Relations have been described as a "wicked problem" --- that is, an
extremely complex situation comparable to the period before World War I
that could easily spiral into conflict.23 Russian and American leaders,
and publics, have powerful perceptions and beliefs that are
fundamentally different. Russian political elites believe that "the
purpose of U.S. policy is to cause damage to Russia," and that
Washington pursues this policy through NATO expansion, promoting color
revolutions, conducting information campaigns, deploying troops in
Eastern Europe, and imposing economic sanctions.24 As Andrej Krickovic
has argued, Russia's internal vulnerabilities --- weak institutional
legitimacy, national identity issues, and contested borders ---
constitute a domestic dimension of the security dilemma. [Authoritarian
[leaders fear **destabilization**]{.mark} by hostile democratic powers
and affiliated nongovernmental organizations promoting change. These
[**domestic insecurities** lead to aggressive behaviors that generate
fears]{.mark} in Washington about Russian intentions, which then lead to
countermeasures]{.underline}.25

American officials, for their part, tend to discount or simply do not
recognize the threat that democracy promotion and human rights advocacy
pose to authoritarian elites. [Russia can justify destabilization
measures against Ukraine]{.underline}, the Baltic states, and other
post-Soviet states, together with cyber attacks and the development of
new weapons systems, [as defensive measures in response to U.S.
policies, but in Washington they are **perceived** as offensive actions
**threatening** American interests]{.underline}. Leaders in Congress and
the executive branch point to Russian meddling in elections, Moscow's
nuclear modernization programs, the annexation of Crimea and stoking
civil war in Ukraine, support for rogue regimes in Syria and Venezuela,
alignment with China, and the poisoning of Kremlin opponents in the
West. [Washington's response]{.underline} is to attempt [to change
Russian behavior]{.underline} largely [through [economic
sanctions]{.mark},]{.underline} which [allow the regime to blame the
West for Russia's economic troubles and stoke nationalism. Sanctions
[increase **distrust** of]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
and]{.underline} support Putin's anti-Western narrative but ultimately
have [**failed** to alter Russian behavior]{.underline}.26

Shiping Tang's [analysis of the security dilemma provides a useful
framework for analyzing the U.S.-Russian relationship]{.underline}. Of
the eight "aspects" he identifies, three are central:
"**[[anarchy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (which leads to uncertainty, fear,
and the need for self-help for survival or security[), a **[lack of
malign intentions]{.mark}** on both sides, [and]{.mark} some
**[accumulation of power]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including offensive
capabilities)."27 Tang argues that a security dilemma [[exists]{.mark}
only [within]{.mark} the framework of [defensive
realism]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on the assumption that neither side
has malign intentions, but that [[each]{.mark} is merely
[seeking]{.mark} [to **enhance security**]{.mark} through various
means.]{.underline} From this position, states have conflicts of
interest that may be reconcilable or irreconcilable and may be objective
or subjective. Tang singles out seven material regulators of the
security dilemma: "geography, polarity, military technology (that is,
the objective offense-defense balance) ... the distinguishability of
offensive and defensive weapons ... asymmetric power, external actors
(allies), and concentration or mixing of ethnic groups."28

While it may be debatable that neither the United States nor Russia has
malign intentions (a necessity for the security dilemma to operate), it
is certainly the case that each side reads hostile intent into the
other's actions.

Russia's military action against [Ukraine]{.underline} has [renewed a
debate about the importance of nuclear weapons for the
alliance]{.underline}, particularly among its European members.

It is important to remember that [nuclear weapons are not
mentioned]{.underline} [in the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline} and
the designation of NATO as a nuclear alliance is a [relatively recent
phenomenon]{.underline} dating only from 2010. But it is [now deeply
entrenched in the alliance's strategic thinking]{.underline},
encapsulated in the mantra: "[as long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO
will remain a nuclear alliance".]{.underline}

The [problem]{.underline} with this is it effectively [closes the door
on thinking]{.underline} creatively [about ways]{.underline} to get to
the alliance's stated objective of creating "[a [security
environment]{.mark} for a world [without]{.mark} [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}".]{.underline} [Something that is
**[essential]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not just for NATO, but
**[[for]{.mark} all of [humanity]{.mark}. ]{.underline}**

In light of the heightened threat of nuclear war, it would be a [[grave
mistake]{.mark} for NATO's leaders [to conclude]{.mark} that nuclear
weapons are [more important than ever]{.mark}]{.underline} for Europe's
defence.

The [alliance]{.underline} says it is [committed to creating a peaceful,
nuclear-weapon-free world]{.underline}, something that is in its
interest, as well as that of the rest of the world. So, NATO members
should be [pushing]{.underline} much harder [for]{.underline} further
reciprocal [bilateral reductions in US and Russian warhead
stockpiles]{.underline} [and]{.underline} working to [revive
multilateral nuclear disarmament talks at the United
Nations]{.underline}.

But [instead]{.underline}, they are [cleaving ever closer to nuclear
weapons and the flawed doctrine of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.
**[[Deterrence]{.mark} [is an unproven theory]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
which its [[adherents]{.mark} [claim]{.mark} has [prevent]{.mark}ed
nuclear [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, but has [[in **reality**]{.mark}
[brought]{.mark} [us **very close**]{.mark} to it on more than one
occasion]{.underline}.

Most notably it was the **[[deterrence]{.mark} mindset]{.underline}**
that [[led]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Soviet leader [Nikita]{.mark}
Khrushchev [to install]{.mark} nuclear [missiles]{.mark} on Washington's
doorstep [in Cuba]{.mark}]{.underline} as a counter to US missiles that
were on Moscow's doorstep in Turkey. This [[led]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
brinkmanship of the **[Cuban Missile Crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[during which]{.underline} it was -- in US Secretary of State Dean
Acheson's words -- [plain, [dumb]{.mark} [luck]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[prevented]{.mark} nuclear]{.underline} [[war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The US has deployed nuclear weapons in European countries since the
1950s. The logic then was that these weapons offset a Soviet numerical
advantage in conventional forces. Since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, followed by the entry into NATO of most former Warsaw Pact
members, as well as the former Soviet Baltic republics and four
successor states of the former non-aligned Yugoslavia, that strategic
landscape has transformed. Now it is [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[conventional advantage over
Russia]{.mark} and does not need nuclear weapons in Europe.]{.underline}

Yet, [in the past year NATO has [doubled]{.mark} [down]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} its commitment to [nuc]{.mark}lear]{.underline}
[weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} with the US introducing a [new, more
powerful, nuclear bomb]{.underline} (the B61-12) and a new nuclear
capable stealth [fighter bomber]{.underline} (the F35A) to the countries
that currently host American weapons, Belgium, Germany, Italy, The
Netherlands and Türkiye (although the latter is yet to receive the F35).
There are also signs the US may be about to [return]{.underline} these
[weapons to]{.underline} one of its [bases]{.underline} in the UK.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[used]{.mark} this [as a
**justification**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [deploy]{.mark} [nu]{.mark}clear
weapon[s]{.mark} to]{.underline} its ally and neighbour Belarus, which
borders NATO members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. An own goal for NATO
given the US weapons in Europe serve little practical military purpose.

[NATO insists]{.underline} the American nuclear [weapons
deployed]{.underline} in Europe [are permitted under the Nuclear
non-Proliferation Treaty]{.underline} (NPT) [while Russia's in Belarus
are not]{.underline}. But [many countries]{.underline} in the treaty
which do not have nuclear weapons [see this as a double
standard]{.underline}.

[If NATO wants to strengthen its security]{.underline} in an
increasingly uncertain world overshadowed by the threat of nuclear
conflict, [it needs to stop clinging to nuclear doctrine and change its
approach]{.underline}.

A [first step]{.underline} woul d be to [end the deployment of American
nuclear weapons in other NATO countries]{.underline}. It [would not
weaken the alliance]{.underline} one iota, [but]{.underline} would [send
a signal that the alliance is serious about reducing nuclear risks and
de-escalating nuclear tensions with Russia]{.underline}.

This should be [followed by the US and Russia engaging in a transparent
and reciprocal disarmament process,]{.underline} leading to [both
countries]{.underline} and NATO  [dropping]{.underline} their
[opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons]{.underline} (TPNW). This treaty, which complements the NPT,
came into force in 2021 and [already has nearly half of all countries as
signatories or parties]{.underline}.

NATO's nuclear-armed members, France, the UK and the US, have so far
been hostile to the treaty and put pressure on other countries not to
join it, and NATO's secretariat has taken the same approach. However,
some NATO members, including Belgium, Germany, Norway, and The
Netherlands, have tentatively engaged with it by observing its meetings
of states parties.

[The TPNW is the only treaty that bans all nuclear weapons-related
activity, and it offers a fair and verifiable pathway to a world without
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. But the failure of most NATO members to
engage with it suggests they are not taking the nuclear threat as
seriously as they should.

NATO claims being a member of the TPNW is incompatible with being a
member of the alliance, but this is a political argument not a legal
one. There is nothing in the treaty that prevents a state party from
being a member of a military alliance involving nuclear-armed states. It
only precludes them from taking part in nuclear weapons-related
activities.

There is also the precedent of many NATO members having joined the
treaties banning landmines and cluster munitions despite US opposition.
In other words, NATO has a tradition of accommodating differences of
opinion on what weapons are acceptable. 

[For an alliance that says it wants to create a security environment for
a nuclear-weapon-free world to double down on nuclear sharing shows
**confused strategic thinking**]{.underline}.

In order to make good on its commitment to work towards "a safer world
for all ... without nuclear weapons", [[NATO needs to]{.mark} go back to
its roots in the Atlantic Treaty, [wean]{.mark} itself [off]{.mark}
being a [nuclear alliance dependent on **outdated deterrence
strategy.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Russia's war against Ukraine and NATO's Nordic enlargement]{.mark} are
[sharpening]{.mark} existing [security risks for
Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, NATO's enlargement is putting more
pressure on North Atlantic Sea Lines of Communications (SLOC) and the
Nordic-Baltic Arctic continuum. Moscow's posture seeks to remove tension
from the AZRF through defense in depth and extend its ambitions of
denial. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and NATO]{.mark} might
therefore have to [face a more contested environment around]{.mark} the
regional [chokepoints of]{.mark} the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom
([GIUK) and]{.mark} Greenland-Iceland-Norway ([GIN]{.mark})
gaps.]{.underline} Even though Russian capabilities must not be
overestimated, efforts to impede US and other NATO allied reinforcements
to NATO's northeastern flank, as well as ensure unfettered access to the
North Atlantic by US carrier groups, must be of paramount importance.

[Russian contestation around the North Atlantic chokepoints also applies
to the Pacific Arctic, particularly around the Bering Strait, where
[Moscow]{.mark} might [seek to contest passage through the
Strait]{.mark}, as well as [increase]{.mark} its [military presence
along]{.mark} the [Kuril--Chukchi]{.mark} defensive line.]{.underline}
This situation would potentially challenge the maintenance of US air and
maritime sovereignty over Alaska and the North Pacific SLOCs. Russia's
somewhat sparse military presence in the Far East could one day be
augmented by the increased presence of the Chinese Navy (PLAN). Russian
and Chinese navies and air forces have repeatedly exercised together in
the Pacific. In addition, Russia's June 1, 2023 opening of the home port
of Russia's Pacific Fleet to Chinese commercial activity represents a
milestone in future joint military activity and increases the likelihood
of hybrid activity via Chinese fishing and other commercial vessels.

[It is anticipated that the [Kremlin]{.mark} will maintain, if not
[increase]{.mark}, the [level of sub-threshold destabilization against
NATO and US interests in the region]{.mark}, seeking to [undermine
alliance cohesion and impose costs]{.mark}. In the circumpolar context,
[Russian activities]{.mark} have [raised expectations that the **Kremlin
may seek further interruption or sabotage attempts against subsea
critical national infrastructure**]{.mark}---namely maritime subsea
infrastructure, unburied data and communication cables, and energy
pipelines.]{.underline} Norwegian energy supplies to Europe are
particularly vulnerable to aerial drones and UUVs and where more
resilience and redundancy are required.

[Although efforts are made to avoid unnecessary circumpolar tension and
military escalation, **the [Kremlin]{.mark} is generally [more willing
to take risks, tolerate costs, and violate international norms as
evidenced by its activities in Ukraine as well as the Black
Sea.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Russian aircraft regularly range NATO's and
NORAD's air identification zones (ADIZ) and often without adequate
warning. On August 14, as this report was being finalized, the Danish,
Dutch, and UK air forces all responded to two Russian bomber flights
over the North Sea near their national airspace. The UK's Royal Airforce
reported that two of its Quick Reaction Alert jets intercepted the
aircraft "in international airspace north of Scotland on Monday, within
NATO's northern air policing area." Russian pilots are prone to
unprofessional and reckless behavior. Russia's (and Ukraine's)
increasing use of drones, moreover, substantially increases the
likelihood of small-scale miscalculations and tactical errors where
Russian restraint should not be taken for granted. **[[Spillover effects
from one theater to another or other forms of horizontal escalation
cannot be discounted]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Finally, Russia's continued international isolation, and its growing
alignment with Beijing, are creating wider risks to the international
system and circumpolar governance. Russia's war in Ukraine, for the
first time, disrupted the work of the Arctic Council in its nearly 30
years of existence. Experts and officials from the Arctic 7 agree that
continued cooperation with Russia through the vehicle of the Arctic
Council during Russia's chairmanship was not viable, but opportunities
are being sought to slowly allow work to be done with Russian
interlocutors under the Norwegian chairmanship through the activities of
its working groups. While there is no going back to the status quo ante,
Arctic 7 officials seek stability and transparency from Moscow while
managing the risk of escalation -- which requires the continuation of
communication with Moscow to avoid miscalculations and tactical errors.
With this in mind, current bilateral channels of operational bilateral
dialogue between countries of the Arctic 7 and Russia focused on
specific issues, such as search and rescue and border control, are being
maintained. [The United States and allies seek to uphold a [stable,
low-tension environment in the]{.mark} Arctic, but this will [require
allied clarity and unity of public facing
messaging.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The extraction of natural resources such as oil, gas, minerals, and ores
has long been a part of Russia's Arctic policies, and it is not alone
among the Arctic states in that fact[. But in recent years as
environmental regulations have played an increasing role in
international agreements, Russia has resisted reducing its resource
extraction in the North despite the growing support for doing so among
other Arctic states and the signing of several international treaties
with that goal. **[Economic growth is a high priority for Russia and it
is unlikely to support measures that could limit
it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Russia's recent intensification of its Arctic military presence, port
infrastructure, and Arctic-capable weaponry]{.mark} is often internally
justified as being [in response to NATO's]{.mark}, especially, [the
US's, intensification]{.mark} in the Arctic (Petersen and Pincus
2021).]{.underline} The US, on the other hand, often justifies its own
actions as being a response to Russia's buildup. [But as far back as
2008, [Russia]{.mark} stated that it intended to "[improve the
capabilities of the border troops to match the sophistication of
potential threats to Russian national security in the Arctic]{.mark}"
(2008), thereby [setting the precedent]{.mark} for its official
reasoning for Arctic military build up as defensive.]{.underline} The US
has been skeptical of the true intentions of the allegedly defensive
posturing, arguing that in the Arctic "'The Russian military... may
leverage ostensibly defensive capabilities for other purposes'"
(Petersen and Pincus 2021). [This [blurring of the boundaries]{.mark}
between what capabilities, weapons, and actions are defensive vs
offensive is a common [precursor to or symptom of a security
dilemma]{.mark} (Glaser 1997, 186), and it certainly [makes Arctic
relations between the US and Russia more difficult.]{.mark} But the
[buildup]{.mark} of military weapons in the Arctic [extends]{.mark}
beyond the security of the region [into global rivalries]{.mark}. For
example [Russia's Arctic-based Northern Fleet includes the nuclear armed
ballistic missile submarines that ensure its second strike capability in
the event of a nuclear attack]{.mark} (Wall and Wegge 2023, 4), and
**[its most effective nuclear missiles against the US are located in the
Arctic.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Introduction

[The **Arctic** has **reemerged** as a critical region for global
**security** and **stability**]{.underline}. For years, the United
States and its partners and allies have sought a "low-tension"
environment. However, [geopolitics and **strategic competition** mean
the circumpolar security **landscape** is **changing
fast**.]{.underline}

Arctic governance is suffering. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
2022 prompted a limitation of activities involving the Russian
Federation in the Arctic Council1 and other circumpolar cooperative
frameworks. This institutional limbo2 will likely persist. [**Fragmented
cooperation** marks a long **step back** from the spirit of the 2008
Ilulissat Declaration]{.underline}.3

The "High North, low tension" and "**[exceptional Arctic]{.underline}**"
[mantras are increasingly **outdated**]{.underline}. Since the 1987
Murmansk Initiative,4 the logic of "Arctic exceptionalism" relied on
stakeholders focusing on cooperative governance. [Underlying drivers of
**insecurity**, including **adversarial** and competitive geopolitical
**dynamics**, were always present]{.underline}, if hidden.

Climate change adds complexity.5 On top of diminished ice coverage,
[**submarine** operations]{.underline} --- from torpedo launches to
hydro-acoustics --- [are **challenged** by changes in **seawater**
quality and salinity]{.underline}.6 Boreal [**wildfires** also require
military **assistance**]{.underline} to aid overrun civilian responses.
Most importantly, climate change means more physical access to the
Arctic across all domains. [As the]{.underline} civilian (e.g.,
commercial shipping, resource extraction, fishing, tourism) and
**[military]{.underline}** (e.g., standing forces and constabulary
operations) [presence **increases** in Arctic waters and skies, more
**incidents** and **accidents** will undeniably happen]{.underline} ---
especially risks linked to environmental degradation due to
environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters (especially
radioactive waste management in Russia).7 Unfortunately, the most
affected are likely to be local and Indigenous communities.8

Russia began reinvesting in Arctic affairs in the mid-2000s.9 [The
**Kremlin** remains adamant in asserting **complete control** over the
**A**]{.underline}rctic **[Z]{.underline}**one of the
**[R]{.underline}**ussian **[F]{.underline}**ederation (AZRF), extending
defense in depth through interdiction capabilities away from the Russian
Arctic, [and protecting perceived vital **interests** along the
**N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute
(NSR). Russia has been rapidly militarizing NSR approaches, especially
across critical choke points,10 and modernizing local infrastructure.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. In Moscow's
calculations, receding sea ice coverage means that the once "natural"
border no longer offers sufficient protection. [The **Kremlin**
consequently **fears** that the US and **NATO** will soon increase
surface, subsurface, and air deployments]{.underline} closer to the
AZRF. [This situation is fraught with **miscalculation** and tactical
**errors**]{.underline} that could lead to dangerous escalation with
global consequences.

[This fear has been **amplified** by Sweden's and Finland's **NATO
accession**, fueling a sense of **encirclement**]{.underline}12 and
vulnerability.13 [Ukrainian **drone strikes**]{.underline} on the Olenya
air base,14 home to strategic aviation assets, in July 2024[, raises the
**question** of how potent Russia's multilayered **defense**
capabilities truly are.]{.underline}

#### The risk of [miscalculation]{.underline} from encirclement is [high]{.underline}.

**Savin '23** \[Leonid; International relations analyst and Professor at
the University of Euro‑Asia; 11‑01‑2023; "The battle for the Arctic
intensifies," Geopolitika,

However, [ecology]{.underline} can also be [used as a **tool
of**]{.underline} political pressure or **[provocation]{.underline}**,
as was the case with the attack on the Prirazlomnaya platform by
Greenpeace. Returning to the global assessment of the role of the
Arctic, the Center for a New American Security in its analysis of
possible Russian actions in the region directly links events in Ukraine
and the West\'s response to them. On this basis, the authors suggest
that: - Contrary to Putin\'s claims that [**[Finland and
Sweden]{.mark}**\'s]{.underline} membership in NATO poses no threat to
Russia, their [**[accession]{.mark}** to the alliance]{.underline} would
[[profoundly alter]{.underline} [regional security]{.underline}]{.mark}
dynamics, [Moscow\'s relationship]{.underline} with each country
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, ultimately, **[[Russian threat
perceptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region. - The Kremlin\'s sense
of security [will likely be affected by]{.underline} the [relocation
of]{.underline} any [NATO infrastructure]{.underline} to Finland and
Sweden, the increase in the scale and complexity of NATO exercises in
the region, the concentration of air power on the Nordic peninsula,
cross-border air exercises, increased intelligence gathering and the
changed dynamics in the Baltic Sea, which will now be surrounded by NATO
member states. This [[sense of **Russian
insecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark} may [**[increase]{.mark}** the
[likelihood of **miscalculation and escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. -
[Russia\'s war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
the [weakening of]{.underline} its [conventional armed
forces]{.underline} are [likely to [make]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} political and military [[leadership
see]{.underline}]{.mark} the [increased [**utility of nuclear weapons**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[managing escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
conflict, increasing the importance of the Kola Peninsula. -
[**[Russia\'s]{.mark}** growing [sense of
**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[along with]{.underline}
[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} channels of
[[communication]{.underline}]{.mark} with the West, will likely [lower
the threshold for]{.underline} what the [Kremlin]{.underline}
[responds]{.underline} to [in the Arctic]{.underline} and likely
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**unpredictability of**
**Russia**\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[actions]{.underline}]{.mark} there.
**[Putin]{.underline}** is also [likely to **[see]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the [[**Arctic** as a **place to demonstrate**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline} still [a power [to be
feared]{.mark}]{.underline}, [increasing]{.underline} the [risk of
Russian]{.underline} provocations and
[miscalculations/escalations]{.underline} in the Arctic.\[4\]

At the same time, one possible scenario points to a rapprochement
between Russia and China, which is now happening. At the same time,
there are [[calls for the **EU**]{.mark} to pursue]{.underline} a more
[independent policy in the Arctic]{.underline} region. \"[Russia\'s war
against Ukraine]{.underline} also [[gives]{.underline}]{.mark} the [EU
[regional reasons to]{.mark}]{.underline} further
**[[strengthen]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [economic
**[ties]{.mark}**]{.underline} with countries and regions in the North
Atlantic - from Norway and the Faroe Islands to Iceland and Greenland
and even the United States and Canada. Immediate security issues in
which the EU can play a role are, for instance, the (critical) import of
minerals or the use of Union satellite systems. In this way, the [Arctic
could [become]{.mark}]{.underline} [another example of]{.underline} the
[EU\'s transformation]{.underline} from a technocratic [regulator
to]{.underline} a [[**geopolitical actor** willing
to]{.underline}]{.mark} actively [use]{.underline} its [economic
interdependencies]{.underline}, [to [confront]{.mark} its **[strategic
dependencies]{.mark}**]{.underline} - as analyzed in the context of the
Industrial Strategy update - or to protect its member states from
coercion by third parties.\"\[5\]

MS: Though Russian submarine exercises and weapons tests are concerning,
especially in Norway's backyard, **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
has **[[been]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the **[predominant]{.mark}**
pattern [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[U.S.-Russian]{.mark} interaction
**[in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the end of the
Cold War. It is [important **not** to]{.underline} **[overstate Russian
aggression]{.underline}** [in the Arctic]{.underline}; Norwegian Prime
Minister Erna Solberg has said the [Arctic]{.underline} does [**[not
pose]{.mark}** [core **security concern**]{.mark}]{.underline}s today,
and other Norwegian analysts have suggested they "[do not
consider]{.underline} a [conflict likely]{.underline}."

The same cannot be said for Europe or the Indo-Pacific, where U.S.
interests are considerably more robust. Practically, the shift in
**[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and NATO **[strategic
goals]{.mark}**]{.underline} that would be [[required to match]{.mark}
[Russian capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} and credibly compete with
Moscow [in the Arctic]{.underline} is **[[not
feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While Russia has twenty-two fully
operational military icebreakers, the United States only has two. There
is also no consensus within NATO if the [Arctic is]{.underline} an [area
of military concern]{.underline}; Canada, an "Arctic Five" littoral
state, has said repeatedly that it does not believe NATO should play any
role in Arctic matters.

Given limited resources, the United States and NATO should be focusing
on regions of existing contention with Russia, not simply shifting
military capabilities to a region out of some ill-defined need to
"match" Russia.

[[**Aggressively rebalancing** Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
Arctic]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[not
desirable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are [[many feasible scenarios
where]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[military
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}** could **[[break
out]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[over **resource**]{.mark}
**[competition]{.mark}**, **[territorial disputes]{.mark}**, [and
**unsanctioned passage**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea
[R]{.mark}oute]{.underline}, to name a few. But the [[most plausible
scenario]{.underline}]{.mark} that could drive military conflict and
greater frequency of Russian military exercises
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**larger NATO** military
**presence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Given
Moscow's sensitivity]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic
**[[encirclement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a concern that has extended
into the Arctic, [increasing NATO operations]{.underline} are likely to
[[contribute to]{.mark} the **[security dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[likelihood
of]{.underline}]{.mark} misperception and
**[[miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [undermining strategic
stability]{.underline} in a rapidly changing region where there is
currently no mechanism for dialogue on security issues.

The United States and its allies must find a way to preserve their
influence in an increasingly important region without making military
conflict more likely. For one, improving intelligence, reconnaissance,
surveillance (ISR) and communications infrastructure is a pivotal,
though less antagonistic, way to improve Arctic operational readiness.
The United States and its allies could utilize unmanned aerial systems,
high altitude balloons, and satellites in highly elliptical orbits
(HEO), which spend extended periods over the Arctic, to close the
positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) gap and monitor Russian assets
in the region. Perhaps more importantly, since there is currently no
Arctic security forum that includes Russia, [Arctic states should
**use**]{.underline} NATO's established [**[dialogue
channels]{.underline}** [with Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} through
the NATO-Russia Council, as Dr. Rebecca Pincus has advocated. While
NATO's military function would be counterproductive, its
[political-organizational function]{.underline} could
[[help]{.underline}]{.mark} to **[[lower]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[likelihood of **[miscommunication]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This forum
would also [open the possibility [for **greater
collaboration**]{.mark}]{.underline} on rules to govern the region as it
becomes more accessible to other actors.

Ultimately, at a time of extreme regional flux, it would be a [[**bad

Firm, Predictable, Consistent, and Clear Responses

Russia\'s Arctic zone is critically important to the future of the
Russian economy. The investments that Moscow is making to build out the
Arctic region are keys to Russia\'s economic future. But as these
investments increase and Moscow sees greater geo-economic opportunity on
the Arctic frontier, so too does it see increasing military risk. Both
ideas are linked in Russian thinking.79

Misplaced assumptions about military strategy pertaining to the Arctic
have clouded policymaking judgment in both countries. [Unfortunately[,
**mutual** **misinterpretation** is triggering a security
dilemma]{.mark}. As this article has pointed out, [American
**officials** have **misinterpreted** Russia\'s Arctic militarization as
aimed at achieving **overall** regional **dominance** and
control]{.mark}]{.underline}.80 [They have responded by [**advocating**
for conducting Freedom of **Navigation** **operations** in the
Arctic]{.mark} b]{.underline}y the U.S. Navy and several unannounced
strategic bomber patrols.81 Moscow interprets these options, made with
the good intentions of enforcing international law and providing a
strategic deterrent, as evidence of aggressive U.S. intentions with some
of the military platforms that Moscow fears most. Thus[[, both sides
have **misread** each other, and **spiraling** **escalation** is the
result.82]{.underline}]{.mark}

To overcome this dynamic, the United States and NATO should respond with
actions and statements that are firm, predictable, consistent, and
clear. To date, the United States has responded in ways that are quite
firm, but [that [**lack** the **consistency**, **predictability**, and
strategic **clarity** necessary to inform Moscow of U.S.
intent]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, in a 2019 speech,
then-[[Secretary of State Mike Pompeo]{.mark} decried "a pattern of
aggressive Russian behavior" in the Arctic and "new threats to the
Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in the
region."]{.underline} But the speech [**[lacked]{.underline}**
**[clarity]{.underline}**]{.mark} about both the sources of U.S.
unhappiness and its policy response. Pompeo sewed together excessively
restrictive Russian regulations in the Northern Sea Route with its
fortification of Arctic bases; and then invoked Ukraine to warn, "We
know Russian territorial ambitions can turn violent." In response,
Pompeo asserted that "partly in response to Russia\'s destabilizing
activities," the United States is "hosting military exercises" and
"strengthening our force presence."83 Here, there is both a muddled
problem definition, as well as an overly broad policy prescription that
can easily lead to uncertainty by the target audience in Moscow.

[[U.S. policy has neither clearly nor consistently communicated what
Washington is and is not willing to tolerate]{.mark}, nor the realistic
conditions under which the United States would respond with firm,
practical measures.]{.underline} As a result, demonstrations of strength
are not anchored in a diplomatic messaging context that facilitates
their intended interpretation by Moscow. Combined NATO naval activities
in the Barents Sea and strategic bomber flights over the Arctic provide
a firm, credible deterrent message, but, in light of Russian military
theory, unannounced missions of the sort conducted in 2020 were read as
unpredictable and, thus, destabilizing.

[[**New** U.S. **nuclear policies** meant to **deter**]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark} nuclear **[aggression]{.mark}** appear to be
[reinforc]{.mark}ing [Russia's **siege mentality**]{.mark} and may be
pushing Russia closer to its escalation threshold]{.underline}. The
absence of regular strategic discussions between the United States and
Russia has led to significant misalignment between the two countries
regarding nuclear intent and nuclear threat perceptions. This, against
the backdrop of ongoing political and military tensions, may increase
the likelihood that an accident or miscalculation could trigger
escalation leading to nuclear war.

Russia's Response

For [Russian officials]{.underline}, who tend to [view policy rather
than force posture as the main indicator of impending conflict,
doctrinal changes surrounding low-yield nuclear options]{.underline} in
the 2018 NPR, have [raised concerns that the United States is seeking to
lower the nuclear-use threshold]{.underline}.[^77^ Despite the United
States' insistence that new **low-yield nuclear weapons** are intended
only for deterrence, a recent article from [Russia]{.mark}n news agency
Inforos [claims]{.mark} that the [deployment of new]{.mark} [low-yield
nuclear weapons]{.mark} "fits into the military doctrine of the United
States, which [provides]{.mark} for a [preventive nuclear
strike]{.mark}" to impose "lightning-fast damage to the enemy's
decision-making and control centers."]{.underline}^78^ In combination
with ongoing U.S. development of precision-guided weapons, which could
support a massed aerospace attack, and the installment of NATO EFP
troops in the Baltics, which are backed by NATO's strong conventional
military, [new U.S. low-yield nuclear weapons that are seen as
**lowering** the **threshold** for nuclear **warfare** appear to
[dangerously approach Russia's thresholds for
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. A recent Rand analysis warns that, when
taken together, a series of seemingly reasonable [[deterrence]{.mark}
measures such as these may be **[perceived]{.mark}** by Russia [as
crossing a **redline** and trigger]{.mark} an **[aggressive
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^79^

Moscow has also expressed concern that the United States' new submarine
launched, low-yield warheads are a precursor to the deployment of
additional U.S. and NATO nuclear weapons on the European
continent.^80^ [**Russian** officials **fear** the possibility that NATO
expansion would put nuclear **weapons** close to its borders and expose
Russia to a no-warning strike.]{.underline}^81^ Therefore, [since the
end of the INF treaty, Russia has grown concerned about a possible
return to Europe of intermediate-range missiles, which could once again
expose Russia to no-warning nuclear attacks from the West.]{.underline}
In a 2019 meeting with Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov, [**Putin** raised concerns that new U.S.
low-yield nuclear weapons would be mounted on intermediate-range
missiles]{.underline}, which he alleged were already in
production.^82^ According to Putin, a return of intermediate-range
nuclear forces in Europe would exacerbate the risk of nuclear
confrontation and lead to uncontrolled escalation.^83^

[These concerns parallel an apparent shift in Russia's
**launch-on-warning** nuclear policy]{.underline}, which is included in
the 2020 nuclear doctrine.84 In a 2018 speech, President Putin suggested
that any nuclear response to an incoming missile attack on Russia would
require confirmation that the attack involved nuclear weapons. However,
the [Kremlin's 2020 document on state policy in the nuclear sphere does
not specify that an incoming missile must be identified as nuclear to
warrant a **nuclear response**]{.underline}.^85^ According to Russian
military political scientist Alexander Predzhivev, this means that [in
the event of an attack, Russia would not attempt to determine whether or
not a missile is nuclear before deciding to
retaliate.]{.underline}^86^ A similar view was voiced by Russian defense
ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who, in response to the U.S.
development of the W76-2, stated that "any attack involving a U.S.
\[submarine launched ballistic missile\], regardless of its
specifications, will be perceived as a nuclear aggression. . . . Under
the Russian military doctrine such actions are seen as warranting
retaliatory use of nuclear weapons by Russia."^87^

Pathways to Nuclear Escalation

[With [nuclear **threat perceptions high**]{.mark}, an accident or
[**miscalculation**]{.mark} leading to conventional conflict could
**[escalate]{.mark}** quickly to the nuclear-use threshold]{.underline}.
As noted by Arbatov, most nuclear-related crises are not based on
aggression but misunderstandings that spiral out of control.^88^ The
[reduction in strategic communication that has accompanied recent
breakdowns in arms control agreements has left American and Russian
defense planners and policy makers to interpret opposing nuclear
doctrines from their own perspective.]{.underline} As shown in this
article, [this has led both countries to perceive each other's nuclear
policies as aggressive and threatening.]{.underline} Former NATO deputy
supreme allied commander Sir Richard Shirreff recently warned that, in
the current geopolitical climate, [a miscalculation between NATO or
Russia would likely lead [to **nuclear
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.^89^

[A possible catalyst for military conflict between Russia and the United
States/NATO could be an **accident** caused by a military drill or a
[**misinterpretation** of]{.mark} a [military
exercise]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both NATO and Russia regularly engage in
large-scale military drills near the Russian border in Eastern Europe.90
[Russia has characterized NATO drills as
**provocative**]{.underline}.^91^ Citing concerns about NATO expansion,
Russia recently declined to modernize the 2011 *Vienna Document*, which
mandates confidence-building measures designed to prevent accidental or
inadvertent escalation of military exercises.^92^ The [close proximity
of recent NATO and Russian military exercises has raised concerns among
analysts that an accident or inadvertent collision could occur and lead
to escalation]{.underline}.^93^ [A military exercise could also be
perceived as preparation for an impending attack]{.underline}, as was
the case for Russia's 2008 Kavkaz exercise, which preceded Russia's
invasion of Georgia, or Russia's recent troop buildup on the Ukrainian
border, which Russia claimed was a military exercise but was
[[viewed]{.underline}]{.mark} in the West [[as]{.mark} a possible
precursor to **[military aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}.^94^ The
potential danger of misreading military drills is highlighted by the
Able Archer incident in 1983, when Soviet intelligence misinterpreted a
NATO command post exercise as preparation for a nuclear strike, and
Soviet nuclear forces were placed on high alert.^95^

[The risk of **inadvertent escalation** is complicated by the growing
prevalence of weapons, air platforms, and command and control
infrastructure that can serve in both nuclear and **conventional
roles**]{.underline}. These dual-capable systems Taylor 219 Strategic
Culture increase the risk that a conventional attack may be perceived as
nuclear.^96^ [The Russian nuclear arsenal includes many weapons
platforms that can be armed with both conventional and nuclear warheads.
These weapons are often stored at the same facilities that house
strategic and tactical nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Moreover, the
United States increasingly relies on dual-capable command and control
infrastructure, including targeting satellites and early-warning
satellites for both conventional and nuclear operations.

Should a conflict occur, this [weapon and infrastructure **ambiguity**,
combined with heightened nuclear **threat perceptions** and mutual
launch on warning nuclear postures, provides]{.underline} a variety of
potential [pathways to **escalation**]{.underline}. For example, during
early phases of a conflict, the United States may employ
precision-guided munitions or aerospace assets to conduct strikes on
Russian dual-use missile facilities to challenge Russia's conventional
capability or command and control infrastructure to complicate military
operations. To [[Russia]{.mark}n officials]{.underline}, who
[[fear]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is [preparing
for]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}fighting, such an attack may be
perceived as a counterforce strike targeting nuclear assets, [prompting
a nuclear response]{.mark}]{.underline}, as provided by Russian
doctrine. Alternatively, [fearing an **aerospace attack** or large-scale
military incursion backed by nuclear weapons, Russia may choose to
operationalize escalation management principles with conventional
strikes on **critical infrastructure** using **dual-capable
weapons.**]{.underline} In such a scenario, the [United States may
misinterpret the incoming missile as nuclear and respond with a nuclear
strike,]{.underline} or, if the strikes targeted command and control
infrastructure, the United States may respond with nuclear weapons, as
provided by American nuclear doctrine. [Due to heightened threat
perceptions and challenges due to **[entanglement]{.mark}**, nearly any
missile attack on U.S. or Russian infrastructure could be misinterpreted
and **[trigger]{.mark}** a **[nuclear response]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 

#### Deterrence risks Russian [nuclear]{.underline} response due to [fear]{.underline}.

Most concerning to Biden is the prospect that [**[Putin]{.mark}** might
[resort to]{.mark} the use of a [**nuclear weapon** if]{.mark} Russia's
leaders were to [face]{.mark} what they consider a **[serious
defeat]{.mark}**.]{.underline} That [Russia]{.underline} has not yet
[move]{.underline}d [tactical nuclear weapons out of
storage]{.underline} is no guarantee that Russia's leaders would not do
so [if [they **fear**]{.mark}**ed** strategic defeat.]{.underline} Under
these conditions, [Russia]{.underline} might [use a strategy akin to "a
threat that leaves something to chance"]{.underline} that could [bump
up]{.underline} directly [against]{.underline} [Washington's strategy of
"learning by doing]{.underline}." These two strategies could collide in
unexpected and dangerous ways as pessimistic [Russian leaders learn from
the [success of]{.mark} the [U.S. strategy]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**recognize** that they need to act as well as speak]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.mark}'s leaders could [learn]{.mark} that they need
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} do more than issue verbal threats. They could
then initiate some kind of material action---put strategic forces on
high alert or move some tactical nuclear weapons out of storage---to
[[increase]{.mark} the [**credibility** of]{.mark} their
**[threats]{.mark}** and better **manipulate risk**. ]{.underline}

Even before the invasion began and several times since, [Putin and other
Russian leaders have made veiled threats that they could use nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns
affirmed that the United States continues to take seriously Russia's
nuclear "saber rattling": "It is a risk that we cannot afford to take
lightly; on the other hand, the purpose of the saber rattling is to
intimidate us as well as our European allies and the Ukrainians
themselves." Burns put the strategic dilemma of managing escalation
directly. The United States, he said, has to "weigh . . . those threats
carefully but also not be intimidated by them."^\[74\]^

These [[threats **intensified**]{.mark} [in]{.mark} October after
Ukrainian troops broke through and pushed Russian forces back from
Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south.]{.underline} In
Moscow, military bloggers openly criticized the abject performance of
the Russian army and its senior military commanders. As failures on the
battlefield and domestic criticism intensified, [U.S. intelligence
overheard a conversation among senior Russian military commanders about
when and how Moscow might use a tactical nuclear weapon in
[Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin was reportedly not part of these
conversations. That intelligence was circulated inside the U.S.
government in mid-October.^\[75\]^ Almost at the same time, Russian
Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu, in one of his calls with Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin, [[accused]{.mark} **Ukraine** [of planning]{.mark}
to use a "**[dirty bomb]{.mark}**."]{.underline}[\[76\] The
[**vagueness** of]{.mark} the [threats]{.mark} along with an
**increase** in their frequency [deepened **concern**]{.mark} that
[Russia]{.mark} could be manipulating risk in the [face]{.mark} of a
tactical [defeat]{.mark}]{.underline}. The available evidence cannot
establish whether Russian generals were deliberately manipulating risk,
as Schelling would have recommended, but the effects were similar in
many ways.

In 2020, the Kremlin published its first declassified six-page long
nuclear doctrine, titled "[Basic Principles of State Policy of the
Russian Federation on **[Nuclear Deterrence]{.mark}**" (2020) which
explicitly set down the factors that could **[provoke]{.mark}**
[Russia's]{.mark} nuclear **[response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, the
document declares that [Russia will resort to nuclear use [if]{.mark} it
receives reliable data on the launch of [ballistic missiles]{.mark}
against it or its allies, thus declaring a "**launch-on-warning**"
policy]{.underline} (otvetno-vstrechnyi udar). The second condition for
nuclear use is [if nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction
(**[WMDs]{.mark}**) are [used]{.mark} against Russia or its
allies]{.underline}. Third, [Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear
weapons in the event of an **[attack]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} Russian
nuclear command, control, and communications
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Finally, and most importantly,
[Russia is prepared to use its nuclear capabilities in the event of
**aggression** against it, by means of conventional weapons, which
threatens "the very existence" of the Russian state]{.underline}. In
general, the doctrine implies that Russia, like the United States, does
not deny the possibility of a first nuclear strike. Despite the
intention to clarify some important points in Russian policy on nuclear
use, Kofman and Fink (2022) contend that the doctrine remains
"intentionally ambiguous on key considerations, substantiating a
spectrum of nuclear employment options and strategies".

[The full-scale invasion of **Ukraine** in 2022 became the first serious
practical test of the nuclear doctrine]{.underline}. Numerous Russian
officials and observers cited nuclear doctrine both to deny the rumors
of a possible nuclear use and to call for nuclear escalation against the
backdrop of increasing Western involvement in the conflict. For example,
Putin's spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on March 28, 2022: "[We have a
security concept that very clearly states that only when there is a
threat against the existence of the state in our country, can we and
will we actually use **nuclear weapons**",]{.underline} without
specifying what these threats actually are (Peskov 2022). On a different
occasion, Lavrov noted that "all Russia's doctrines, including the
nuclear one, apply on all the territories enshrined in the Russian
constitution", hinting that the occupied Ukrainian territories annexed
by Russia both in 2014 and later in 2022, fall under the "protection" of
Russian nuclear weapons (Lavrov 2022b).

What is more, [as the situation on the front **worsened** for
[Russia]{.mark}n troops, several experts [demanded]{.mark} that the
[nuclear doctrine]{.mark} be amended to [lower]{.mark} the [threshold
for nuclear use]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trenin (2024b), for instance,
claimed that the passage in the [nuclear doctrine]{.underline} on the
"threat to the very existence of the state" should be [[changed
to]{.mark} "[threat to]{.mark} the **vital [interests]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the [country]{.mark}]{.underline}", arguing for a broader
set of scenarios that could allow nuclear use. Although the
[Kremlin]{.underline} has so far opted for the more pragmatic, albeit in
the short term probably more damaging on the domestic front, solution of
declaring (partial) mobilization, [there are several indicators that
similar [sentiments]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the **[lowering]{.mark}**
of the **[threshold]{.mark}** for nuclear use are shared among
high-ranking Russian military and political top brass]{.underline}. In
June 2024, Putin declared that the [Russian]{.underline} side "(\...) is
now [thinking about what could be changed in the nuclear doctrine",
framing it as a response to Western actions, which he saw as working
toward amendments aimed at "lowering the threshold for the use of
**nuclear weapons**"]{.underline}. [[Putin]{.mark} was thus hinting at
similar [adjust]{.mark}ments to the [Russian]{.mark}
[posture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Putin 2024c).

Moscow's recent decision to deploy low-yield nuclear devices on the
territory of its ally Belarus should be seen in the light of this
worrisome development. [As the military advance in Ukraine stalled and
Russia's **relations** with the West rapidly **deteriorated**, Putin
announced,]{.underline} in March 2023, that [Russia would deploy
tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus]{.underline}. In his explanation as
to why he was taking this step, Putin pointed to NATO's ongoing nuclear
mission as a precedent: "We're basically doing the same thing they \[the
US\] have been doing for a decade. They have allies in certain countries
and they train (\...) their forces. We are going to do the same thing"
(Putin 2023a). To this end, Russia reportedly refitted ten Su-25
aircraft for readiness to deliver nuclear weapons, provided additional
training for Belarussian fighter pilots, and transferred several
dual-capable Iskander and Polonez multiple rocket launchers to the
territory of its ally (Sputnik 2024). Several open-source indicators
suggest that the Lida airbase, located just 40 kilometers from the
Lithuanian border and the only Belarusian Air Force wing equipped with
the Su-25, is the most likely candidate for Russia's new "nuclear
sharing" mission in Belarus (Kristensen, Korda, & Reynolds 2023a). In
May 2024, Belarus unexpectedly joined the second leg of Russia's
"surprise test", as Belarussian soldiers trained on the deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons together with their Russian counterparts.
[While exercises like this are not the first of their kind and similar
maneuvers have been carried out several times before, the scale as well
as the practice of [nuclear sharing]{.mark} with Belarus during
exercises are **[unprecedented]{.mark}**. Many specialists have
interpreted this as an [**escalatory** move and]{.mark} a **direct
[signal]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}]{.underline}, testing
its resolve and raising the cost of continuing its support to Ukraine
(cf. Trevelyan 2024).

[[Trump's]{.mark} **['reverse Nixon']{.mark}**
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [Nixon]{.underline} Strategy refers to President Richard Nixon's
1972 visit to China during the Cold War, a move that [warmed U.S.-China
ties and helped isolate the Soviet Union]{.underline}.
[Conversely,]{.underline} today's pundits of international relations
describe the [Trump administration's]{.underline} [approach as the
so-called reverse Nixon strategy, aiming to **[draw Russia
closer]{.mark}** as a **[counterbalance]{.mark}** to
**[China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

However, this concept does not align with historical realities. When
President Nixon discreetly sent National Security Advisor Henry
Kissinger to Beijing, the conflict between China and Russia had already
reached a point of no return. At that time, the U.S. government simply
capitalized on the evolving situation. This scenario contrasts sharply
with the current state of Sino-Russian relations. First, Russian
President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping share an
unprecedented personal bond, having met over 40 times since 2013.
Second, the war in Ukraine has intertwined Russia and China's interests
more tightly than ever before.

In an interview with Breitbart News, [President Trump asserted that if
improving U.S.-Russia relations could lead Moscow to "**disengage from
China**," it would be "a good thing]{.underline}." Following his
discussions with President Putin, Mr. Trump told Fox News, "As a student
of history, I've looked at all of history -- the first thing you learn
is that you [don't want Russia and China to go together]{.underline}."
However, his perspective on geopolitics seems muddled, or at the very
least, inconsistent.

Elbridge Colby, the [U.S. undersecretary of defense for
policy]{.underline}, suggested that the White House's focus should
primarily be on the Indo-Pacific region. During a Senate hearing on
March 4, he [referred to China as "the **[biggest]{.mark}** [and
**strongest** adversary]{.mark} that the United States has had in
probably 150 years]{.underline}."

The Trump [administration's reverse Nixon strategy aims to
**[divide]{.mark} China and Russia**,]{.underline} yet it seems to
overlook the robust economic partnership and mutual benefits binding
Beijing and Moscow.

Beijing goes from worried to confident

Upon taking office in January, Mr. [Trump]{.underline} adopted a
[notably conciliatory approach toward]{.underline} President
[Putin]{.underline}, often [engaging with him in a highly amicable
manner]{.underline}. [In return]{.underline}, [the [Russian]{.mark}
[leader]{.mark} frequently [expressed]{.mark} [positive]{.mark}
[sentiments]{.mark} about his American counterpart]{.underline},
[suggesting]{.underline} a potential for [rapid improvement in
relations]{.underline} between Moscow and Washington. This dynamic has
unfolded alongside U.S. efforts to mediate peace in the ongoing Ukraine
conflict. [The **[shift]{.mark}** in U.S.-Russia engagement has
[caused]{.mark} **[great consternation among China]{.mark}**'s political
elite.]{.underline}

However, Russia has responded with dissatisfaction to the White House's
design for peace in Ukraine, appearing reluctant to fully align with
this vision. [President [Putin's]{.mark} **[strategic goals]{.mark}**
likely extend beyond what Mr. Trump anticipates]{.underline}. The
Russian leader [perceives]{.underline} Mr. [Trump as
**[manipulable]{.mark}**, overly **trusting** and influenced by his
confident businessman mindset]{.underline}. President
[Trump's]{.underline} skeptical and at times [dismissive]{.underline}
[stance toward NATO and Ukraine aligns with the Kremlin's
interests]{.underline}. To mitigate the economic strain of the ongoing
war, [Russia seeks support from countries like the U.S.,]{.underline}
particularly in easing sanctions.

President [**Putin** [intends to **leverage**]{.mark} improved U.S.
[relations]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **exert [pressure]{.mark}** on
**[Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} has
[capitalized]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}'s [economic
challenges]{.mark} stemming from the war, pressing it to reduce natural
gas prices and buy Chinese cars and goods.]{.underline} [Strengthening
ties with the U.S. would advance Russia's interests]{.underline}.

[Since 2025, [Beijing]{.mark} has **[cautiously signaled]{.mark}** to
Moscow]{.underline} that [there should be limits to a [U.S.-Russian
detente]{.mark}]{.underline}, [warning]{.underline} that [exceeding them
could **[strain Sino-Russian relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On April
1, [Chinese Foreign Minister]{.underline} Wang Yi met with President
Putin in Moscow, where he [stated that constructive Russia-U.S.
engagement could foster positive expectations amid global
challenges]{.underline}, while describing the [reverse Nixon strategy as

As DoD observes, "Russia boasts the largest Arctic territory and the
most developed regional military presence of all the Arctic nations. Of
concern, Russia's Arctic capabilities have the potential to hold the
U.S. homeland, as well as Allied and partner territory, at risk," though
such a concern dates back the Cold War when Russia was part of a much
larger state and empire, and whose ideological opposition as the
principal strategic adversary to the West rallied much of the world (and
in particularly, the formerly colonial world once occupied and
subjugated by the West), behind Moscow's banner as the world's
revolutionary vanguard, once a role played by a much younger and more
idealistic United States.13 DoD further observes the "Kola Peninsula is
home to Russia's Northern Fleet and important strategic nuclear forces,
specifically its submarine-launched ballistic missile force," and that
"Russia continues to invest heavily in new military infrastructure and
refurbishing Soviet-era installations in the Arctic" -- though it omits
mention of the context that makes the Arctic so important to Russia:
that Russia's remote, northern geography excludes European access to an
all-year, warm water seaport, elevating the strategic importance of its
colder and more remote Arctic coast.14 [[Russia is **active**]{.mark}

Trump makes U.S-Russia Arctic cooperation [irrecoverable]{.underline}.

**Meduza '4-22** \["Breaking the Ice."; Meduza, Russian-English
independent news website in Riga, Latvia; 22 Apr. 2025,
meduza.io/en/feature/2025/04/22/breaking-the-ice.\]//neev

Since returning to the White House, Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[overseen]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[rapid
thaw]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[in **relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[with **Moscow**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among the more curious points of
alignment: a renewed focus [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite Russia's ongoing war against
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the very conflict that **[[fractured
U.S.--Russia ties]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- both countries have begun
speaking, at least in broad strokes, about possible cooperation in the
world's northernmost region. Proposals range from sharing sea lanes to
joint energy development projects. But with sanctions still in place and
trust in short supply, scientific research now appears to be the
easiest, least politically fraught arena for renewed engagement. Even
there, though, the [[two sides]{.underline}]{.mark} may be **[[further
apart]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[than they seem]{.underline}]{.mark}. To
understand how climate science, geopolitics, and Arctic ambitions
collide, Meduza spoke with two leading experts: Arild Moe of the
Fridtjof Nansen Institute and Ilia Shumanov, director of the Arctida
project.

Donald Trump's talk of annexing Greenland has drawn widespread
condemnation from much of the international community. From Vladimir
Putin? Not so much. At the end of March, the Russian president called
the idea historically justified and said he believed U.S. ambitions on
the island were serious. According to Ilia Shumanov, director of the
Arctida project, the fact that Putin "didn't respond to this idea with
mockery, but rather took it quite seriously" stood out. "The unexpected
consensus around Greenland," he believes, "became the starting point for
some kind of dialogue" between Russia and the United States.

Greenland's new prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded to
Donald Trump's talk of annexing the island, saying the U.S. "will not
get it." Juliette Pavy / Bloomberg / Getty Images

Indeed, while Trump has yet to deliver the swift peace in Ukraine he
once promised, talk of U.S.- Russia cooperation in the Arctic has
expanded into ambitious (if vague) proposals --- potentially spanning
everything from trade routes to energy development projects, according
to Trump envoy Steve Witkoff. But even amid the attempted rapprochement
between Washington and Moscow, serious obstacles to Arctic cooperation
remain. As Arild Moe, research professor at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute, told Meduza, while Trump may have grand ideas about U.S.
companies getting involved, he doesn't have the power to dictate
strategic decisions to private American firms the way Putin does to
Russian state-owned companies.

"There's no deal that can commit American business to investments in
Russia happening overnight," Moe said. For any of this to be plausible,
the risks would have to be manageable --- and right now, Moe said,
"long-term investments in Russia look quite risky because the economic
\[and\] political situation is unpredictable." Even if sanctions were
lifted, "[[American companies]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[don't]{.underline}]{.mark} [[seem]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly
**[[eager]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to return to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Russian market]{.underline}]{.mark}** right now," Shumanov
concurred.

There's also the matter of nationalization, which the Kremlin has been
actively using to seize foreign-owned assets since the full-scale war
began. As Shumanov put it, when Trump leaves office, "Vladimir Putin, if
the mood strikes him, could easily sign another decree nationalizing the
next enterprise." With joint business ventures still difficult to
justify --- and military cooperation all but unimaginable --- Shumanov
believes the most realistic area for actual engagement is environmental
science. "Joint climate research, coordination, disaster prevention ---
that kind of collaboration could start tomorrow, even with major
political differences," he told Meduza. "Russian and American scientists
and climate experts could meet through Arctic Council working groups and
begin working together." ![The Cape Baranov Ice Base, a key Russian

--- an intergovernmental forum focused on scientific and environmental
cooperation --- has managed to survive not only Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine but also Finland and Sweden's accession to NATO,
which left Russia the lone non-NATO country in the Arctic Circle. "It
was almost on its deathbed," Moe said, "but it seems that all parties
wanted it to remain." Still, he said, "the level of contact and
cooperation within that framework is at a very low level today" ---
though he acknowledged that international interest coupled with concern
for the region's vulnerability could lead to renewed cooperation. The
Kremlin crushed Meduza's business model and wiped out our ad revenue.

On thin ice Climate change is having an outsized impact on the Arctic.
By some projections, the region could lose all of its summer sea ice
before the middle of the century if warming isn't slowed. But what's bad
for the planet could be good for business. Retreating glaciers are
exposing long-inaccessible mineral deposits, and longer periods of
reduced ice cover are making Arctic trade routes more viable.

Those same shifts, however, can be a double-edged sword for those
looking to capitalize on them. "Climate change also has negative impacts
on shipping in terms of more extreme weather, more coastal erosion,
\[...\] which makes port infrastructure more vulnerable," Moe told
Meduza. And even as sea ice retreats, conditions remain unpredictable.
"You can't plan for no ice, even in the best months," he said. ![A polar

2019. Russian Arctic National Park / AFP / Scanpix / LETA At the same
time, carbon emissions remain a global issue --- and as Moe pointed out,
Arctic routes are shorter than southern ones. "They use less fuel and
emit less greenhouse gases," he explained. "There are those who argue
that the Arctic is a climate advantage."

But the region's volatility still deters many. Even as conditions
improve, Moe said, the volume of Arctic shipping could "double or
triple" without becoming significant "in relative terms." "It will be a
big thing for the Arctic," he added, "but it will still be just a small
proportion of international shipping." And then there's the risk of
environmental catastrophe. "The big fear is a major oil spill," Moe
said. If that happened during the dark season, in a remote area, "it
would be very, very difficult to contain." Shumanov recalls the 1989
Exxon Valdez spill off the southern coast of Alaska as a turning point
in the U.S.'s approach to northern development. "After that,
environmental concerns became central," he said. So far, no disaster of
that scale has occurred within the Arctic Circle itself. But as Moe
warned, if it did, it would "change a lot of the perspectives on Arctic
shipping." ![The diesel-electric ship Talnakh, owned by Norilsk Nickel,

Fedoseyev / TASS / Profimedia Still, while the environment may be one of
the areas with fewer obstacles to cooperation, Shumanov notes that the
U.S. and Russia approach the issue in fundamentally different ways.

"If you compare the strategic documents of the [[U.S. and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which really shape each country's
[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark} and approaches --- you'll see **[[vastly
different]{.underline}]{.mark}** emphases on climate," he said. "U.S.
doctrine places far greater importance on environmental sustainability
and combating climate change." Russia, by contrast, acknowledges climate
change mostly in terms of the benefits it brings: easier access to
resources and the Northern Sea Route. "Environmental constraints,"
Shumanov noted, "are far less the focus." That also seems to be the case
in practice.

"Russia has permitted the use of tankers with no ice class to go through
the Arctic to transport oil from Europe, from the Baltic, to Asia," Moe
said. The shipments began in 2023, after sanctions left Russia cut off
from the Atlantic market. Since then, several vessels from Russia's
so-called "shadow fleet" have made the trip --- ships that are not only
old but, more critically, not ice-strengthened. "Russia maintains that
they're within safety limits" and that the tankers are "escorted by
icebreakers," Moe said. But under normal circumstances, "those ships
would not have been used." Even though they've been sailing during the
most favorable part of the year, he said, there's concern they're
"pushing the limits" and that "the risk of an oil spill is higher than
it should have been." When asked how prepared Russia and the U.S. are
for a real disaster in the Arctic, Moe pointed to a binding
intergovernmental agreement under the Arctic Council framework that
"draws up a picture of zones of responsibility and also calls for
international cooperation" in the event of an oil spill. But in
practice, its utility is limited under extreme, remote conditions.
"There are some preparations, there's some infrastructure, some
equipment around," Moe said, "but hardly enough to control a big oil
spill." ![The Severnoye Siyaniye semisubmersible drilling rig in Kola

TASS / Profimedia 'A wish list --- not a plan' In the same International
Arctic Forum speech in Murmansk where he effectively endorsed Trump's
Greenland ambitions, Vladimir Putin laid out sweeping goals for Arctic
development: more nuclear icebreakers, new ports, and expanded
infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route. Moe called it "a wish list
--- not a plan." "Many of \[the projects\] make sense," he told Meduza.
"They're things that would be good for Russia. But the problem is,
exactly how is this going to be implemented?" Russia is spending heavily
to support its war against Ukraine. The federal budget for 2025--2027
set a record for defense expenditures --- but even that may be hard to
sustain. The broader economy is anything but stable. "We've seen similar
lists of proposals before," Moe added. "Russia has issued several Arctic
documents with a long, long list of important projects without
explaining how they\'re going to be financed." Though Russia's real
approach to the environment may tell a different story, Putin did devote
time to climate concerns in the same speech --- albeit only after
blaming the West for the breakdown in cooperation. He spoke of
preserving the Arctic's "unique natural environment," called for
"environmentally friendly technologies," and proposed a new research
center to monitor the effects of climate change --- not to curb them,
but to guide infrastructure planning. ![A researcher walks near ice

meanwhile, for all its talk about the Arctic's strategic importance, has
slashed funding for NOAA and other agencies with Arctic research

isn't just about protecting the environment; it also provides critical
information for operating in it, like sea ice forecasts. "In the shorter
term \[the cuts\] may not have such very clear effects," Moe told
Meduza. "But it's a long-term problem --- the

1\. **[Knowledge Gaps]{.underline}**

A key area of bilateral work between Russia and Alaska has been
assessing the impacts of rising Arctic air temperatures on permafrost,
the layer of frozen soils which stretches across much of the
circumpolar. Russia encompasses most of the permafrost-covered soils in
the Arctic. [The wartime **prohibition** on communication meant that
U.S. **scientists stopped** sending equipment to Siberia]{.underline},
and [Russian scientists could **no longer send data** to their Western
partners]{.underline}. One Russian permafrost scientist noted that in
his field, an interruption in shared data collection and analysis can be
tolerated for a short while because anticipated changes in Siberia can
be inferred by research in Scandinavia and Alaska. However, the
scientist said that, in the long term, the loss of information coming
from Russia will cause "estimates of changes in global permafrost \[to
be\] biased."      

2\. **[Decline in Trust]{.underline}**

[Russian and American **interviewees**]{.underline} alike [spoke about
the **value** of both personal and professional
**relationships**]{.underline} with their respective international
colleagues. They recounted how developing research questions jointly,
then working together, often for multiple years in a row, built strong
foundations of trust and respect for the other "side." These bonds
helped many cooperative projects flourish over three decades. [This
**core element** of successful bilateral work]{.underline}, however, [is
**now in jeopardy**]{.underline}, [as two years of little to **no
in-person fieldwork**]{.underline} (during the pandemic), [followed by
**three years** of virtually **no communication**]{.underline}, [have
eliminated the opportunities for Russian and American experts to
meet]{.underline}, share ideas, conduct fieldwork, and nurture their
working relationships.  

Two other factors may be expected to dilute the trust that developed
between American and Russian biologists and experts over the past 30
years. [First]{.underline}, [**anti-American propaganda** has become
**deeply entrenched** in Russian society]{.underline}, particularly in
the media, since Russia invaded Ukraine. [Second]{.underline}, [the
**Trump** administration is **hollowing out** federal natural resource
management **agencies** and scientific **organizations**]{.underline},
further [decreasing the likelihood that people]{.underline} once
actively involved in bilateral projects [will be able to reignite their
relationships]{.underline}.

"[There are **few people**]{.underline}, if any, **[left]{.underline}**
in the government [who were **involved** in the **formation** and
implementation of the]{.underline} \[[**U.S.-Russian Agreement** on the
Conservation and Management of the Alaska-Chukotka Polar Bear
Population]{.underline}\]. So it's a real concern that as the years
pass, the will to resuscitate this agreement will wane and all of the
work that went into this treaty will be reversed." - American biologist

Introduction

[The Arctic has reemerged as a **critical region**]{.underline} for
global security and stability. For years, [the **U**nited **S**tates and
its partners and allies have **sought** a "low-tension"
**environment**]{.underline}. However, [**geopolitics** and strategic
competition mean the circumpolar security **landscape** is **changing**
fast]{.underline}.

[Arctic governance is suffering]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
full-scale **[invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}** in 2022 [prompted a
**limitation of activities** involving the **Russian** Federation in the
**Arctic Council**]{.underline}1 [and other]{.underline} circumpolar
[cooperative frameworks]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} institutional
limbo2 [will **likely persist**]{.underline}. Fragmented [cooperation
marks a long **step back** from the]{.underline} spirit of the 2008
[Ilulissat Declaration]{.underline}.3

The "[High North, **low tension**]{.underline}" and "exceptional Arctic"
mantras [are **increasingly outdated**]{.underline}. Since the 1987
Murmansk Initiative,4 the logic of "Arctic exceptionalism" relied on
stakeholders focusing on cooperative governance. [Underlying drivers of
**insecurity**, including **adversarial** and competitive geopolitical
**dynamics**, were always **present**, if hidden]{.underline}.

interest in Greenland is focused mainly on its proximity to
strategically important naval routes between the Arctic and Atlantic
Oceans---including for nuclear-armed submarines---and the fact that
Greenland hosts a key U.S. military base." "China has similar aims in
global shipping and resource access, including in the Arctic, where
melting sea ice is creating opportunities for expanded maritime
transport and energy exploitation, especially along the Northern Sea
Route (NSR) off Russia's coast."

End of Western Wishful Thinking

While the Northern European Arctic states---Norway, Sweden, and
Finland---have been eager to cooperate with Russia in the Arctic in good
faith, [Russia has used the **narrative** of "**Arctic exceptionalism**"
and framing the region as a zone of **low tensions** as a screen for its
military build-up]{.underline}. Russia has also been able to get away
with actions directly threatening the safety of the wider region, while
its Nordic neighbors have kept extending a helping hand. In 2021, [the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [offered to **bear
half** of the cost of an **operation** to lift the two nuclear
**submarines** that **Russia** has **sunk**]{.underline} in the Barents
and Kara Sea. Previously, Sweden and Norway had provided substantive
financial support for equipping the Russian ship Serebryanka to tackle
the nuclear waste issue. **[Russia]{.underline}**, however, ended up
using the vessel in a nuclear testing and developing program.

With the European security order in pieces, [there is **no reason to
expect** the Arctic to **remain** a zone of **peace**]{.underline},
safely secluded from growing geopolitical tensions elsewhere. A recent
Finnish government-commissioned study assesses the security outlook in
the European Arctic as bleak, with [Putin's **regime survival** directly
**linked** to the military-**strategic value** and energy resources of
the region]{.underline}. [The **trust basis** for cooperation with
Russia has **eroded**]{.underline}, even if Russia's stated strategic
objectives for the Arctic do not necessarily change in the future. Its
smaller [Nordic neighbors must become **increasingly
cautious**]{.underline} about resuming cooperation with Russia, as
[Russia could use such **frameworks** against their
**interests**]{.underline}.

In May 2021, cooperation on "peaceful, sustainable economic development
and environmental protection in the Arctic" was included by the G7
foreign ministers in a short list of issues on which they are ready to
interact with Russia 8 . The speech of Secretary of State E. Blinken at
the ministerial session of the Arctic Council in Reykjavik on May 20,
2021 9 , which contrasted sharply with the scrappy speech of his
predecessor M. Pompeo in Rovaniemi two years earlier, may indicate
Washington\'s cautious departure from the harsh Arctic rhetoric of the
Trump administration.

[This tendency, however, may turn out to be unstable against the
background of alarmist narratives that still dominate the political
discourse 10 . Both in the West and in Russia, the emphasis is on the
most threatening scenarios for the development of military-political
situation in the region. [Western media]{.mark} are full of [reports
about testing of]{.mark} the [Russian]{.mark} nuclear-powered unmanned
submarine carrier "[Poseidon]{.mark}", [test launches of]{.mark} the
hypersonic missile "[Zircon]{.mark}" in the Northern Fleet, [Russian
icebreakers armed with missiles, large-scale Russian military
construction in the Arctic]{.mark}, etc. All this is presented [as a
manifestation of **Russia\'s desire to dictate its own rules in the
Arctic Ocean**]{.mark}.]{.underline} China is credited with ambitions to
challenge the Arctic countries, and, if necessary, with the use of force

[11 . [Russia]{.mark} is [paying attention to]{.mark} the [growing
intensity and scale of military trainings of]{.mark} the [US Navy and
NATO in the Arctic]{.mark} region, [approaching closer to]{.mark} the
[borders of]{.mark} the [Russian Federation]{.mark}]{.underline} 12 .
The US and NATO naval exercises military ships trainings in the Barents
Sea since 2020 13 , Norway\'s decision to allow the US nuclear
submarines to use the port of Tromsø in the north of the country \[4,
Anthony I., Klimenko E., Su F., p. 15\], temporary deployment of four
B-1B Lancer bombers at the Orland air base in the south of the country
in February 2021 are regarded by Russia as provocative 14 . [The
Fundamentals of Russian State Policy in the Arctic, approved in March
2020, notes "a foreign military presence" and "an increase of conflict
potential in the region" as one of the challenges to the country\'s
national security]{.underline}

[15 . The situation is complicated by the "freezing" of military
cooperation with Russia by the Arctic countries since 2014. The [lack of
channels of regular communication between]{.mark} the [militaries at
various levels]{.mark} makes it [impossible to discuss and resolve
emerging concerns]{.mark}, including by [agreeing on mutual restraint

submarines]{.mark}---[in]{.mark} a [conflict with
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}8 Concerns about the security of these assets
largely account for [Russia's efforts to improve its
anti-access/area-denial systems and monitoring and surveillance
capabilities, the increasing tempo of strategic exercises and patrols of
long-range bombers and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, and the
upgrading of military infrastructure to support these
operations.]{.underline}

[9 A [second]{.mark}, partly related, interest [is protecting]{.mark}
Russia's [ability to operate in]{.mark} the [North Atlantic and]{.mark}
the [European Arctic in]{.mark} the event of a [conflict with
NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unlike Russia's other fleets, the Northern
Fleet has direct access to the Barents and Norwegian Seas and the
Atlantic Ocean[. Its [ability to operate]{.mark} there could be
[critical in determining the outcome of a conflict on NATO's eastern
flank.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[10 A [third]{.mark} interest [is military protection for Russia's
growing economic development, investments, and commercial interests in
the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} The vastness of the region, the long
and open borders whose only protection is offered by remoteness and
inhospitable climate, the poor communications systems and
infrastructure, the overall harsh environmental conditions, and growing
civilian activities there increase the risk of maritime shipping,
nuclear, and environmental accidents---and thus the need to be able to
rapidly deploy military-response capabilities.

Russia's peacetime military presence in the Arctic and the allocation of
resources to improve its military capabilities and infrastructure there
are aligned with these interests. [**[Maintaining a predominant military
position in the Arctic is seen as a necessary component of Russia's
posture there]{.mark}**, given the Kremlin's priorities in Europe and
tense relationship with the West, NATO's enhanced military capabilities
near the Russian border, and Western sanctions targeted to constrain
Russian energy exploration and production activities in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

The US-NATO Deterrence Strategy

[As the threat of invasion grew, [Washington **converted** its
**deterrence policy** into a deterrence
**strategy**.]{.mark}]{.underline} This strategy [[relied predominantly
on deterrence by **punishment**]{.mark},]{.underline} though it
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} included an important element of deterrence
[[by **denial**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Punishment, defined as [[imposing
unacceptable costs on an opponent,]{.mark} was to be meted out
**[through an intense sanctions' regime]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
West's most comprehensive such package to date.\[xxiv\] [[Denial,
defined as increasing the likelihood an opponent's mission will
fail]{.mark}, was to be achieved through the [controlled release of
**critical** **intelligence** concerning Putin's plan]{.mark}, thereby
[denying it a chance to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[xxv\]

Punishment. [[Sanctions aimed to **weaken** Russia's economic base by
**depriving** it of **critical** **tech**]{.mark}**nologies** [and
markets, thus **crippling its ability to wage
wa**]{.mark}**r**]{.underline}.\[xxvi\] The United States sanctioned
some 1,705 Russian individuals; 2,014 entities; 177 vessels; and 100
aircraft.\[xxvii\] The European Council, for its part, adopted 11
packages of sanctions beginning in 2014 with Putin's hybrid war against
Ukraine.\[xxviii\] In total, [[Moscow has suffered more than **13,000
sanctions**---more than Iran, Cuba, and North Korea combined---for its
military aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} against Kyiv.\[xxix\]

In theory, [**[the effectiveness]{.mark}** of sanctions [depends on the
ratio of economic power between those states]{.mark}]{.underline}
executing the sanctions and those being sanctioned.\[xxx\] Ergo, the
West ought to have enjoyed a significant advantage because
[[Russia's]{.mark} economy was only the 11th largest in the
world]{.underline}, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of \$1.78
trillion USD, or 1.8% of the world's total output in 2022.\[xxxi\]
Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter, second-largest natural gas
producer, and third-largest oil producer, but [its **[GDP is less than
7% of the US GDP and less than 15% of the EU's
GDP]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[xxxii\] [[Experts boldly predicted the
Russian economy would collapse within a matter of
weeks]{.underline}]{.mark} or at most months, and recovery would take
decades.\[xxxiii\] But the predictions proved grossly optimistic as
Russia's "fortress economy" weathered the storm of sanctions and shifted
to a war footing with financial support from India and China.\[xxxiv\]

The West's overoptimism regarding the coercive power of
sanctions---which has declined in recent decades due to overuse,
mis-targeting, and countermeasures---indicates just how much it desired
a low-risk solution to Russian belligerence.\[xxxv\] Also, historical
evidence suggests sanctions tend to reshape security environments in
unintended ways, perhaps provoking aggression rather than deterring it,
since adversaries sometimes feel compelled to choose between living with
a cap on economic growth or attempting to use force to remediate the
situation.\[xxxvi\]

[Denial. As mentioned, [NATO repeatedly]{.mark} released credible
intelligence to cause the Russians to abort their invasion]{.underline}.
The Russians, unfortunately, proved either too stubborn, too inept, or
too overconfident to comply. NATO also released other information
ranging from the positioning of blood and other medical supplies closer
to the front, signaling an attack was imminent, to the Kremlin's
false-flag operations, designed to blame Ukraine for the war. [NATO also
**[disclosed information concerning Russia's planned "decapitation"
strikes and its use of "kill lists" of key Ukrainian
officials]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[xxxvii\]

Importantly, [[Biden and Stoltenberg]{.mark} [held back a key denial
measure, **military** **force**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[xxxviii\] As
Stoltenberg stated when asked about the possibility of establishing
no-fly zones over Ukraine, "we are not part of this conflict, and we
[have a responsibility to ensure that it does not escalate and spread
beyond Ukraine, because [that would be even more devastating and more
**dangerous**]{.mark}."\[xxxix\] Both leaders were roundly criticized
for their reticence.\[]{.underline}xl\] But [[their call was the
**right** one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Admittedly, NATO's Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), the spearhead of the NATO Response
Force (NRF) could have deployed quickly to Ukraine with follow-on forces
close behind. However, **[[little evidence exists to suggest how such a
move would have been received politically]{.underline}]{.mark}**, given
Ukraine's non-Alliance and non-democratic status; it was merely a
"regime in transition."\[xli\]

To be sure, the United States could have acted unilaterally and deployed
a "tripwire" force, consisting perhaps of elements of the 173rd Airborne
Brigade and/or units from the 82nd Airborne Division. Yet research into
the use of tripwire-forces suggests they seldom prevent an aggressor
from seizing its objective and subsequently establishing a strong
defensive position; nor do such forces necessarily incur enough
casualties to induce the rest of an alliance to intervene. Rather, the
forces sent to deter "must be sufficiently substantial to shift the
local balance of power" to succeed.\[xlii\] Even with the authority the
US executive possesses to deploy US military force, such a move would
have run up against stiff criticism and probably failed to gain
political support, since neither the US Congress nor the American public
wanted to put US troops in harm's way during the crisis.\[xliii\] In any
case, deploying military forces into Ukraine may have accelerated rather
than deterred Putin's assault. As some experts believe, he was
undeterrable on this issue and planned to overrun Ukraine quickly,
presenting the West with a fait accompli it could only reverse with
great difficulty, if it had committed forces.\[xliv\]

To summarize, [[the West's deterrence strategy was **self-evidently risk
averse**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But it [enabled the West to [retain the
**"moral high ground**"]{.mark}]{.underline} and to [[punish Moscow
through **sanctions** and **security** force assistance to Ukraine
without becoming involved in the conflict
**directly**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Those types of measures can be
replicated and serve as a model for a risk-averse, **[consequentialist
deterrence strategy]{.underline}**.

Consequential Deterrence. **[[The West is already in "consequence
mode,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** so to speak, as it considers what
observations major powers, such as China, are drawing from NATO's
failure to deter Russian aggression.\[li\] But the West currently lacks
a clear definition and a practical theory around which to organize its
efforts. By way of definition, [if deterrence is "measures taken to
dissuade actors from taking certain actions," then [**consequentialist
deterrence** is "measures taken to increase the rival's risks of
suffering failure and negative outcomes, so it chooses not to take
certain actions."]{.mark}]{.underline} By way of theory,
consequentialist deterrence [is based on the premise that **[aggressors
ask themselves]{.mark}** not what it will cost them to take a certain
action, but rather **[what their chances of succeeding are]{.mark}** if
they take the action.]{.underline} **[[Risk is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
simply a function of probability, specifically, [[the **probability**
any number of negative outcomes will occur]{.mark}.]{.underline} Severe
consequences, to reiterate, must also follow if the aggressor's intended
action succeeds.

Obviously, [we want to [lower the risk to ourselves, while **raising
it** for our rivals.]{.mark}]{.underline} One way to accomplish that is
by [transferring as much risk as possible to our rivals]{.underline}.
Risk transfer can occur by [[arming our friends and partners through
security force assistance and partnership programs, as NATO has done
with Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We thus **[increase the adversary's
probability of failure by strengthening our partners]{.mark}** and do so
[without]{.mark} directly [committing ourselves to go to war]{.mark} on
their behalf.]{.underline} Our rivals [[would thus have to face the
West's combined **economic**]{.underline}]{.mark} (and to some extent
military) [**[might]{.mark}**,]{.underline} not just that of the party
they wish to attack. We can also increase the negative consequences to
our foe by, for instance, [[working to reduce its political power or
influence, or by increasing its economic isolation]{.underline}]{.mark}.
We can put such consequences into effect even if our rival's planned
action succeeds.

[[Other]{.mark} consequentialist [actions]{.mark} might [include adding
new allies]{.mark}, **[as NATO did with Finland]{.mark}** and (soon)
Sweden]{.underline}. [Once NATO's production capacity for war material
is revamped, it will be able to "make war without going to
war"]{.underline} by extending the conflict as long as its proxies are
willing and able to fight. In this way, it would have a viable response
to aggression in situations [**[where the "value of the political
object" is decidedly not worth the risk of a major
war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But NATO must go one step further and
develop formal procedures for leveraging its proxy wars more
consequentially, not only to tie down adversaries but also to showcase
how such conflicts are shifting the global balance of power in a sense
that puts the aggressor in a worse situation than the status quo ante.

[Having a meltdown]{.underline}

The [Kremlin's growing [insecurities]{.mark} [about]{.mark} Russia's
[military]{.mark} [and resource capabilities]{.mark} have
[deepened]{.mark} significantly [since]{.mark} the invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. The accession of Finland and Sweden to
**[[NATO]{.mark} has [left]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} effectively
"[encircled]{.mark}" [by]{.mark} the alliance's [members in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This [[intensified]{.mark} its [feelings
of]{.mark} [vulnerability]{.mark}, as did the 2022 [sabotage]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the Nord Stream [pipelines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
[Russia]{.underline} had [already halted gas
deliveries]{.underline} through the pipelines, the [attack]{.underline}
[exposed]{.underline} its [inability to secure critical infrastructure
in the Baltic Sea]{.underline}. In 2024, a successful Ukrainian drone
[[strike]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [Olenya]{.mark}
airbase]{.underline}---located above the Arctic Circle and home to
Russia's strategic bomber aircraft---**[dealt another [blow]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [Kremlin confidence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In parallel, [Western [sanctions]{.mark} targeting Russia's Arctic
projects]{.underline} have [intensified since 2022]{.underline}, with
the 17th EU package adopted in May 2025. They have [largely focused on a
deep insecurity for Russia: [liquefied natural gas]{.mark}]{.underline}
(LNG). But the Kremlin has little room for manoeuvre against these
measures. It has promoted projects like Arctic LNG 2 as replacements for
lost pipeline gas exports to Europe. But [Western
countries]{.underline} have imposed successive sanctions aimed at
[[undermining]{.mark} the project's [viability]{.mark} including
blacklisting the operating company, restricting access to]{.underline}
LNG ice-class [tankers and targeting]{.underline} tanker
[operators]{.underline}. As a result, despite reported efforts by Russia
to circumvent some of these restrictions on Western equipment, the
timeline for Arctic LNG 2 has repeatedly been delayed.

Little wonder, therefore, that just [28 percent of Western Europeans now

presence and experience in [outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}, this
[[advantage]{.mark} is [waning]{.mark} due to fast-growing investments
by state and private actors]{.underline}. The [failure to mature a
profitable commercial segment [underlines]{.mark} the Russian space
industry\'s institutional **[inability to compete]{.mark}** with other
space powers.]{.underline} Instead, the upper hand of the Ministry of
Defense on space programs is further diverting their activities into a
military objective. In other words, the [further military use of outer
space may **lock** Russia into an even more **isolated** space
stakeholder]{.underline}.

The [difficulties in reforming this sector for three decades are now
reaching a **critical threshold**]{.underline}. Without a doubt, the war
mobilization process within Russian society induces long-term
destructive effects on the ecosystem of the space industry and the
fulfillment of its programs \[109\]. As long as the war effort cripples
the Russian socioeconomic organization, it may become a structural
pattern. [The space industry may define a new approach with limited
means, implying downsizing its ecosystem and closing some part of the
inherited infrastructure in coping efficiently with this
shift]{.underline}. The end of cooperation within the ISS by 2030
concludes the post-Cold War period that witnessed the flourishing
partnership between Russia and Western countries \[110\]. The darkening
dynamic opens new processes and may generate a [newly comprehensive
geopolitical arena in outer [space]{.mark} that may [**undermine**
Russia\'s **long-standing role**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Against the
backdrop of this collision course, [Russia is gradually [moving
towards]{.mark} a form of **[autarky]{.mark}** leading the country to
maintain its independence but isolating itself from other major space
powers]{.underline}. The preservation of its strategic autonomy in outer
space will depend on the capacity to process domestic electronic
components for the space industry or sustainably provide them from
alternative suppliers. The strategic alignment with rogue actors leaves
Russia in a precarious position. Thus, the international community is
called upon to prevent the weaponization of outer space while securing
access to Earth\'s orbit, and space infrastructure is critical for the
functioning of our societies \[111\]. As Jackson stated, outer space has
become a critical area through which to respond to or negate Western
strategy and capabilities and influence global norms \[112\]. In general
terms, [Russia\'s [posture as]{.mark} a leading [**space power** is
**eroding**]{.mark} to be **marginalized** and may turn into a
disruptive factor.]{.underline}

**PLAYING TO WIN**

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is **woefully
unprepared** for the emerging competition]{.underline}. Despite efforts
from Congress, especially the delegations from Alaska, Maine, and
Washington, to push successive administrations to devote the necessary
resources to the region, [the U.S. **defense** community has **treated**
it as a **low priority**]{.underline}. [Insufficient **funding**
and]{.underline} insufficient [**attention** create a **vicious
circle**]{.underline}, producing uninspired Arctic strategies that lack
adequate budgets and clear command structures. To get back in the game,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to **ramp up** its
military and economic **presence** in the Arctic]{.underline}, working
closely with its Arctic allies [to **strengthen** its scientific and
surveillance **networks**]{.underline} to better identify and defend
against threats.

[The most visible sign]{.underline} of the United States' inadequate
preparation [is its **aging icebreaker fleet**]{.underline}. [The U.S.
Navy has no ice-strengthened surface ships]{.underline}, a class of ship
that can navigate mostly ice-free waters. [The U.S. Coast Guard has
**only three** icebreakers]{.underline}---a stronger ship designed to
clear passages through solid ice---[but just **two** are **operational**
today]{.underline}, and they must serve both the Arctic and the
Antarctic. Just one, a 50-year-old ship, can break through 20 feet of
ice. In 2024, [Washington purchased the third]{.underline}, a commercial
icebreaker built in 2012, but work must be done on it before it becomes
operational, expected next year. This ship, [which]{.underline} can
break nearly five feet of ice, [is meant to serve as a backup to the
United States' older icebreakers until a new]{.underline}, [more
powerful icebreaker]{.underline} that the first Trump administration
commissioned in 2019 [is constructed]{.underline}. [The **target date**
for that project]{.underline}, currently 2030, **[has been
delayed]{.underline}** by repeated design changes and the erosion of
expertise at U.S. shipyards, which have not built a heavy
icebreaker---one that can cut through ice 21 feet thick---since the
1970s.

The problem goes well beyond icebreakers. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**does not have** sufficient military
**presence** or maritime **infrastructure**]{.underline}, [such as
deep-sea ports]{.underline}, to defend large swaths of Arctic territory.
U.S. forces are able to operate Pituffik Space Base on the north coast
of Greenland, for example, but they cannot secure the entire island.
[The **Trump** administration has also been **jeopardizing** critical
Arctic **alliances**]{.underline}. [Its **aggression** toward **Canada**
and **Denmark** has pushed both countries to enhance their
capabilities]{.underline}---Canada announced plans to construct two new
icebreakers and three new Arctic military bases earlier this year, and
Denmark announced a \$2 billion security upgrade in January and another
\$600 million for surveillance vessels in April---[but threaten to
**damage** their **relationships** with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [in the long term]{.underline}. If
**[Washington]{.underline}** is to compete with China and Russia, it
[**needs** its Arctic **friends** fully on its side]{.underline}.

[Washington must also start **putting real money** behind the
development of U.S. Arctic **capabilities**]{.underline}. Trump has
spoken repeatedly about U.S. interests in the Arctic, and since 2021
Congress has pushed for multiyear funding for an Arctic security
initiative to be included in the Pentagon's budget. It is time to make
that plan a reality. The U.S. Navy needs ice-strengthened ships. Trump
has repeatedly called for the construction of 40 icebreakers, but this
quantity is unnecessary and unrealistic. The Coast Guard has said it
needs eight or nine, and even reaching this number within a reasonable
time frame would require most of the building to be done by foreign
shipyards. [**Runways**, radar **systems**, and other military
**installations** damaged by **thawing permafrost** must be **repaired**
and stabilized]{.underline}. Increased deployments of personnel and
long-range bombers, more and better port facilities and sensors along
the coasts of Greenland, and upgraded satellite communications,
underwater drones, and sea-floor mapping are necessary to monitor the
vast expanse of the Arctic and particularly to detect Russian or Chinese
military activity. As U.S. General Gregory Guillot, the head of the U.S.
Northern Command, put it in his congressional testimony in February,
"[You cannot defeat what you cannot see]{.underline}."

[The U.S. military must also **streamline responsibility** for
operations in the Arctic under a **single regional
command**]{.underline}. In the existing structure, developed in 2011,
[operational **responsibilities** are **divided** between the U.S.
European Command]{.underline}, which covers the European Arctic, [and
the U.S. Northern Command]{.underline} and the U.S.-Canadian
organization NORAD, which together cover North America. U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, meanwhile, manages the bulk of the U.S. Army's
cold-weather and airborne capabilities based in Alaska. With each
command focused on its own area, [**no single entity** has eyes on the
Arctic as a whole]{.underline}. Even the east and west coasts of
Greenland fall under separate military jurisdictions. [A **unified
subregional** U.S. Arctic Command would be able to **detect** and
**respond** to adversaries' activities]{.underline} across the Arctic
and support regional commands.

The **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [[**insufficiently

[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. The future [battlefield]{.underline}

Republic of [China [**fuels** strategic

**[[proactive Arctic strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [working
**[with]{.mark}**]{.underline} its [[NATO **Allies**]{.mark} to
[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [[Arctic remains]{.mark}
[stable]{.mark}]{.underline} and free from conflict. The US's 2022
National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United States "seeks a
stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to internationally
agreed upon rules and norms."1) To achieve a secure Arctic, the 2024
Arctic Strategy, produced by the U.S. Department of Defense, follows a
"monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this [[**reactive strategy** is
**inadequate**]{.underline}]{.mark}.^2)^

[Russia's]{.underline} 2022 **[invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[provides evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[**Moscow** will]{.underline}]{.mark} not adhere to the current
global order and will [continue to **[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**West**ern]{.underline} [[international norms]{.underline}]{.mark}
wherever possible, including in the Arctic. NATO's growing appeal among
European states suggests that NATO may also be called upon to guarantee
the future of Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating
Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in a [closer **alliance** between]{.underline} the [United
States and its Arctic NATO allies]{.underline}. Moreover, NATO, with the
[[accession of Finland and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, has
[expanded]{.underline}, and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations
are NATO members. The [alliance **[offers]{.mark}**]{.underline} an
[[**opportunity** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to strengthen]{.mark}]{.underline} its [position
in]{.underline} the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} region while not
having to go it alone.

The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions, though the makings of a more
effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024 Arctic
Strategy. Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its mindset
towards the Arctic. A [[**proactive Arctic Strategy** is
**needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in [which]{.underline} the [United
States]{.underline} and its NATO partners are [not afraid to
define]{.underline} the [rules]{.underline} and laws governing the

**[antagonize Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} and divert important
resources from the Indo-Pacific region and China. [[This is simply **not

[NATO leaders recognize]{.underline} that [[there is a **finite

against Russia]{.underline}. In 2024 the head of the Norwegian armed
forces warned that NATO countries only have [**[two]{.mark} to three
[years]{.mark}** to prepare [for]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[Russian
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}. Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen
claims that [[**Moscow** is **building**]{.mark} up]{.underline} its
[[military **stockpile** faster than]{.underline}]{.mark} previously
[[predicted]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [Western nations]{.underline}
have [depleted]{.underline} their own [weapons by supplying]{.underline}
them to [Ukraine]{.underline}.22) Several other European leaders have
echoed these concerns, citing that they have between three and eight
years to prepare for a Russian attack against NATO.23) [[Despite
**Russia's aggressive rhetoric**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Moscow
understands]{.underline}]{.mark} that because of its war against Ukraine
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[will not have]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[capability to attack NATO]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [near
future]{.underline}. For instance, Russia removed nearly all its ground
forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine in June 2024.24) Russia's
timeframe to launch a successful attack is dependent not only on its
economy but also on its partnership with the PRC.

Why the U.S. Needs its Arctic NATO Allies

The [United States]{.underline} has already begun to take a more
[[**active approach** in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}; however, the
region [[must become]{.underline}]{.mark} an even **[[greater
priority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Following Finnish and Swedish accession
to NATO, the [alliance's center of gravity]{.underline}, its primary
source of strength and stability, [shifted North]{.underline} and closer
to the Russian border. This is not the first instance of [**[NATO
borders]{.mark}** moving closer to Russia]{.underline}. In 2007, Putin
provided a final "friendly" warning that NATO expansion
"**[[represents]{.underline}]{.mark}** a [serious [**provocation** that
reduces]{.mark}]{.underline} the level of [mutual
[trust]{.mark}]{.underline}."25) The National Defense Strategy (NDS)
reaffirms its commitment to NATO, underscoring the [[importance of
**collective defense**]{.underline}]{.mark} aimed [[at deterring Russian
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite this stated commitment, the NDS
does not directly address how it will respond in the event that Russia
attacks a NATO member state, forcing the alliance to respond. While the
current NDS and Arctic Strategy offer assurances of protection to the
U.S. homeland, [a [**proactive** Arctic **posture**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[will **mitigate**]{.underline}]{.mark} future [**[conflict]{.mark}**
in the region]{.underline}.

The United States already views itself as a leader in the European
Arctic. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sought to
uphold international law, close gaps in governance, and protect
sovereign rights in the European Arctic.^26)^ The United States was
integral in developing multiple intergovernmental institutions,
including the Arctic Council in 1991.^27)^ With growing competition in
the European Arctic, the [[United States should]{.underline}]{.mark}
continue to [[use its **great power status**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [insert itself as]{.underline} a [[lead]{.mark}
actor in]{.underline} the region through the establishment of [[a

[**[deterrence]{.mark}** and potential warfighting in the
region]{.underline}.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, and especially since Russia's invasion of
Ukraine in 2022, the [Arctic has become increasingly characterized by
competition]{.underline} rather than cooperation.1 As described by
Icelandic Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson in October 2024, "whether
we like it or not, the [Arctic is fast becoming]{.underline} a [theater
of]{.underline} global competition and **[militarization]{.underline}**,
and it is up to us to determine the parameters for developing this
region."2 The Arctic [security environment has changed
politically]{.underline}, [reflective of]{.underline} an increasingly
[[**competitive** **posture** between]{.underline}]{.mark} a
consolidated [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} bloc in the West
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a belligerent [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the East.

Prominent among the political challenges facing NATO allies in the
Arctic is [[addressing these changes]{.mark} materially]{.underline}.
The issue is comprehensive and [[involves combining]{.underline}]{.mark}
means in order to underpin deterrence---of [both **[warfare and
gray-zone]{.mark}** [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}---as well as [to
prepare for]{.underline} potential [warfighting]{.underline} scenarios.
In responding to these challenges, Arctic states have an opportunity to
learn from, and leverage, lessons from Ukraine on the role of
technological development in contemporary warfare.

The [[**Ukrainian** battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark} has
**[[illustrated]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[strengths]{.underline}]{.mark} and limitations
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} several rapidly [evolving
**[technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} impacting the character of
warfare. While some technological solutions have provided robust
military advantages (e.g., the Starlink constellation) others have been
caught in action-reaction cycles where advantages have been quickly
neutralized by the adversary (e.g., certain configurations of drones or
precision-guided artillery).3 These [lessons are already
influencing]{.underline} the strategies and [force postures of Arctic
states]{.underline}, including Russia.4

Any [**[response]{.mark}** to]{.underline} the changing
[Arctic]{.underline} security environment [**[requires
addressing]{.mark}** several key **[concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[first is [analyzing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**vulnerabilities** that
impede]{.underline}]{.mark} the [ability]{.underline} of Arctic states
[to]{.underline} credibly and capably both [[deter]{.underline}]{.mark}
and fight [in the High North]{.underline}. At least partially due to the
absence of an independent command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) capability,
[**[situational awareness]{.mark}** is]{.underline} a [[vulnerability of
particular]{.mark} [significance]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 Arctic states
are instead dependent on vulnerable undersea communications
infrastructure, or space-based capabilities that are relatively scarce
and characterized by intra-alliance dependency on the United
States.6 Additionally, [Europe's reliance on Norway]{.underline} as an
energy provider [is]{.underline} [vulnerable to Russian gray-zone
tactics]{.underline}.7

It [quickly became apparent to scholars and theorists that [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} were [not just tools but also
[instruments]{.mark} [of **psychological**]{.mark}
**[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}.85 That effective deterrence and "use"
of nuclear weapons did not mean mushroom clouds on the horizon but
rather the mere threat of their use to instill fear in nations.86

2.1.2 Core Classical Principles of Deterrence

[[During]{.mark} the **[Cold War]{.mark}**, the creation of classical
[deterrence]{.mark} was [founded on]{.mark} certain principles:
**[M]{.mark}**utually **[A]{.mark}**ssured
**[D]{.mark}e**struction]{.underline} (MAD)

MAD [[asserts that stability arises from]{.mark} nations\' [**mutual
ability** to annihilate]{.mark} [one another]{.mark}, a dual
checkmate.]{.underline} In this case, [**[rational]{.mark}
[actors]{.mark} should [avoid war]{.mark}** as the cost of conflict
carries such severe consequences that no sensible actor would pursue
it]{.underline}.87

As the U.S. and Soviet Union developed arsenals capable of imposing
catastrophic losses on each other, a balance emerged that provided a
degree of strategic stability. Things were not perfectly balanced; both
sides would attempt strategies to gain an advantage while balancing
geopolitical ambitions and needs. It c[reated a delicate balance that
constantly shifted as each side sought a strategic
advantage]{.underline}.88

The rise of MAD and this fluctuating balance stemmed from the increasing
lethality of nuclear weapons. Kenneth N. Waltz was a leading political
scientist recognized for establishing the concept of Neorealism in
international relations and was best known for Theory of International
Politics (1979), which advocates that the anarchic structure of the
global system dictates state behavior. Waltz notes, \"[[Nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} **[dissuade]{.mark}** states from going to [war]{.mark}
more]{.underline} surely [than conventional weapons]{.underline} do.
[In]{.underline} a [conventional world, states going to war can at once
believe that they may win and that, should they lose, the price of
defeat will be bearable]{.underline}.\"89 This [[deterrence]{.mark}
framework]{.underline} would come to [**[rely o]{.mark}n the
[survivability]{.mark} [of]{.mark} nuclear forces,** ensuring that any
first strike would be met with devastating retaliation.]{.underline}
Second-Strike Capability

[MAD was built upon **[second-strike capability]{.mark}**]{.underline},
a [state\'s credible ability to retaliate even after suffering a nuclear
attack]{.underline}. It expanded as technology and platforms arose
during the Cold War, offering hardened platforms like ICBMs or platforms
that were hard to detect, such as submarines.90 Schelling noted that
[strategic stability relied on ensuring an adversary had to account for
an unacceptable retaliatory threat against them, rendering the belief in
advantage from a devastating nuclear first strike
untenable]{.underline}. This idea of [second-strike]{.underline}
capability became a [key foundation of deterrence]{.underline} that
[ensured no state would seek nuclear aggression]{.underline}, as there
was no guarantee they would not face swift retribution from
second-strike capabilities.91 This [stability would [lead to crisis
stability theory]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Crisis Stability Theory

[Crisis stability refers to the likelihood of a [conflict]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} [escalating]{.mark} [into]{.mark} full-scale
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as both sides believe aggression will not
provide them an advantage]{.underline}. [[Nuclear deterrence is most
stable when no side is **incentivized** to initiate
first.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Crisis stability requires understanding the connection between limited
responses and open war. As Powell notes, \"A [response that carries some
risk of war can be plausible, even reasonable, at a time when a final,
ultimate decision to have a general war would be implausible or
unreasonable]{.underline}.\"92 This can explain the [paradox of crisis
management under nuclear threat]{.underline}. Instability increases if a
state attacks preemptively to avoid a worse outcome.93

[American]{.underline}---[interest in]{.underline} selective Arctic
[cooperation]{.underline}, [using **promises of investment** access to

European [**leaders** should remain **firm** and
**sceptical**]{.underline} of such overtures and remind Trump that
illusions of Russia's flexibility in the Arctic could be used to obscure
continued intransigence elsewhere.

Even though Europeans have so far had little say in the Ukraine
negotiation process compared to the US, they still hold some sway in
their own right. Europeans should use this to distinguish between
genuine strategic threats and the Kremlin's performative signals
intended to pressure the West into restoring cooperation. Despite its
rhetoric, Russia is unlikely to withdraw from multilateral Arctic
frameworks or abandon UNCLOS mechanisms---particularly its shelf
extension claims---unless Western countries move to politicise these
processes, for example by stalling Russia's submissions due to
sanctions.

[Moscow's **underlying objective** is likely to restore **pre-2022**
formats of Arctic **cooperation**]{.underline}, particularly within the
Arctic Council, [and thus **rehabilitate** its international
**standing** without altering its behaviour in Ukraine]{.underline}.
Europeans must therefore be clear that no return to "business as usual"
in Arctic governance is acceptable without a ceasefire or durable
settlement to the conflict.

On thin ice

The Kremlin is investing heavily in the Arctic and will continue to do
so. In the dreams of [Russia's **leaders**]{.underline}, they [will
**sit down** with the West]{.underline}---mostly with the US---[and
**renegotiate** the **world order** in their favour]{.underline}. [They
will likely try to sell **illusory concessions**]{.underline} in the
Arctic, among others, [while **sacrificing nothing** of
principle]{.underline} in order to gain in Ukraine. Europeans must not
underestimate Russia's continued military build-up in the Arctic,
which---despite pressures elsewhere---remains a long-term Kremlin
priority. Instead, they must track these developments and prepare a
coherent NATO-based response, independent of shifting US leadership and
Moscow's thin veil of concessions.

### Impact\-\--No Arctic War\-\--2AC

#### Russia's exposed infrastructure and weak defenses make future war unsustainable.

Vulnerable Underbelly: The Failure of Force Protection on Critical
Infrastructure,"

// GMemb

Russia's military doctrine, honed through decades of sparse experience
and adapted in the post-Soviet era, emphasizes the projection of power
and the defense of its vast territory. [However, the ongoing [conflict
in Ukraine]{.mark} has [exposed]{.mark} a critical weakness: [a systemic
inability to implement]{.mark} effective [force protection
measures,]{.mark} [resulting in]{.mark} significant [vulnerabilities for
Russia's critical infrastructure]{.mark}, particularly its oil and
natural gas fields.]{.underline} This failure stems from a complex
interplay of factors, ranging from tactical miscalculations and
logistical shortcomings to a potential underestimation of the
adversary's capabilities and a possible overconfidence in Russia's own
defensive capabilities.

Force protection, in its broadest sense, encompasses all measures taken
to safeguard personnel, equipment, and facilities from hostile actions.
For the military, this includes battlefield tactics, intelligence
gathering, logistics security, and the establishment of robust defensive
perimeters. For critical infrastructure, it involves physical security,
cybersecurity, and contingency planning to mitigate the impact of
attacks. Russia's struggles in both areas are glaringly apparent.

On the battlefield, Russian forces repeatedly demonstrated a lack of
effective force protection. From the initial botched attempts to seize
Kyiv to the protracted and costly battles in eastern Ukraine, Russian
units suffered heavy casualties. This was often due to a combination of
poor tactical decisions, inadequate reconnaissance, and a failure to
adapt to the evolving battlefield. Ambushes, artillery strikes, and
drone attacks took a heavy toll, revealing vulnerabilities in their
supply lines and a lack of situational awareness. This inability to
protect its forces has not only hampered Russia's military objectives
but also had a cascading effect on the security of its critical
infrastructure.

The vulnerability of Russia's infrastructure, particularly its energy
sector, is a direct consequence of these force protection failures. Oil
and natural gas fields, pipelines, and processing facilities, often
located in remote areas, require robust security to prevent sabotage or
attack[. However, **[the demands of the war in Ukraine stretched
Russia's military resources thin, leaving critical infrastructure
exposed.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Ukraine's ability to strike targets deep within Russian territory,
including energy facilities, demonstrates this vulnerability. These
attacks not only disrupt energy production and supply but also have a
significant psychological impact, undermining public confidence in the
government's ability to protect its citizens and vital assets.

Several factors contribute to Russia's struggles with force protection
and the resulting infrastructure vulnerabilities. Firstly, the sheer
size of Russia and the length of its borders make it incredibly
challenging to secure all potential targets. This geographical challenge
is compounded by the fact that many critical infrastructure sites are
dispersed and remote, making them difficult to defend effectively.
Secondly, there are indications of potential intelligence failures.
Russia may have underestimated Ukraine's resilience and its ability to
conduct effective counter-offensives, leading to a misallocation of
resources and a lack of preparedness for attacks on its own territory.
Thirdly, logistical issues plague the Russian military. [[Supply-chain
disruptions, shortages of essential equipment, and a lack of
well-trained personnel]{.mark} have all [contributed to]{.mark} the
[erosion of force protection capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Furthermore, the potential for internal dissent and sabotage cannot be
discounted. The war in Ukraine fuels anti-government sentiment in
Russia, and there is a risk that individuals or groups opposed to the
regime may seek to exploit the vulnerabilities of critical
infrastructure to express their discontent. Such internal threats
further complicate the task of ensuring the security of these
facilities.

The implications of Russia's failure to implement effective force
protection are far-reaching. [The [disruption of energy supplies]{.mark}
can have a [devastating impact on]{.mark} the [Russian economy, leading
to shortages, price increases, and social unrest.]{.mark} Moreover, the
[vulnerability of critical infrastructure]{.mark} can [undermine
Russia's international standing and its ability to project
power.]{.mark} **[The perception of weakness can embolden adversaries
and erode alliances, further isolating Russia on the world
stage.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Russia's ongoing struggles with force protection in the context of the
Ukraine conflict have exposed critical vulnerabilities in its
infrastructure, particularly its oil and natural gas fields. These
vulnerabilities stem from a combination of tactical miscalculations,
logistical shortcomings, intelligence failures, and the inherent
challenges of securing a vast and geographically dispersed territory.
The consequences of these failures are significant, with the potential
to destabilize the Russian economy, undermine public confidence, and
weaken Russia's international standing. As the conflict continues,
Russia will need to address these shortcomings if it hopes to protect
its critical infrastructure and safeguard its national interests. The
ability to learn from these failures and adapt its security strategies
will be crucial for Russia's long-term stability and its ability to
project power in the region and beyond.

#### Russia can't afford another war---sanctions crippled its economy, weapons are outdated, and it's relying on overpriced imports and weak allies to stay afloat.

**Ruth 25** (Oliver Ruth is a student in international relations at the
University of Aberdeen, and has experience and qualifications in
intelligence analysis, particularly regarding the current conflict in
Ukraine, 10 January 2025, "The Impact of Sanctions and Alliances on
Russian Military Capabilities,"
https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/impact-sanctions-and-alliances-russian-military-capabilities)
// GMemb

On the one hand, it certainly appears as though the sanctions have very
little efficacy, given how easily they are subverted by Russian allies.
On the other hand, this subversion illustrates an important aspect that
makes sanctions effective. [For all intents and purposes,
[Russia]{.mark} is functionally [cut off economically from the wider
international community]{.mark}, instead being [forced to rely on a
small cadre of partners and satellite states to remain
afloat]{.mark}.]{.underline} As mentioned earlier, defence procurement
facilitated by Russia's partners and allies has paved the way for large
growths in economic output, [but this [growth highlights]{.mark} one
potentially fatal flaw of a militarised economy: [the risk of
overheating, which]{.mark} could in turn lead to a [collapse]{.mark} in
[political standing.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Thanks to the ongoing war, Russia's economic output has been propped up
by its defence spending, particularly because the government and
industries are paying far above the normal market price for sanctioned
goods[. As such, a [decrease in spending]{.mark} is very likely to
[cause a hike in unemployment, a drop in output, and a severe
recession]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such a recession could have a
destabilising effect on the Russian regime and the balance of power in
the country.

**[[Sanctions have achieved the crucial goal of leaving Russia's economy
highly unstable in the medium to long term, and heavily reducing its
military capabilities to an extent that makes its current losses
unsustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**

On top of this, the fact that the government and firms are having to pay
more for goods due to sanctions has severely hampered their production
capability. [This means that [even with foreign aid, there is a
significant gap between the military's needs and actual
procurement.]{.mark} This is perhaps [best illustrated by Russia's
announcement that it]{.mark} would be halting production of the Su-57,
citing an inability to acquire the parts needed to maintain the
aircraft. Instead, it [will be focusing on older platforms like the
Su-35]{.mark}. On top of this, the [Kremlin's announcement]{.mark} that
the state-owned film studio Mosfilm would transfer ownership of its T-55
and PT-76 tanks (which were first manufactured in the 1950s) further
[highlights the gap between needs and production capability caused by
sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To support the analysis, imagery was taken from four Russian air bases
(Engels 2, Buturlinovka, Perm and Lipetsk) for the period between 2021
and 2024. [Two significant trends appeared; the first, and arguably more
significant, was that [many aircraft remained in a static state of
disrepair]{.mark}.]{.underline} The other, more ambiguous trend was that
there was little to no clear change in raw operational craft numbers or
infrastructure.

As discussed in the previous section regarding trade data, [[Russia has
had difficulties replacing and maintaining vehicle numbers]{.mark},
instead relying on its strategic partners to make up for its
unsustainable losses.]{.underline} [At the operational and tactical
level, [this procurement gap has manifested in soldiers making use of
substandard munitions]{.mark} (particularly North Korean shells) [and
outdated weapons platforms and systems]{.mark} (such as the
T-55).]{.underline} The heavy losses have also had strategic
implications, including rendering the Russian regime unable to assist
partners -- most notably the former Assad regime in Syria, which
received little substantive aid from Moscow prior to its fall.

#### Russia is not in a state to launch another major war, largely due to deep-rooted structural problems in its military leadership and reform process.

programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. He focuses on
Russia's civil-military relations and domestic politics and
policymaking, 15 May 2024, "Brass tacks: Why Russia's military fails to
reform,"
https://ecfr.eu/publication/brass-tacks-why-russias-military-fails-to-reform/#russia-and-its-military-state)
// GMemb

[This review shows that [Russian military effectiveness remained quite
low during the all-out invasion of Ukraine, especially during the
initial stages.]{.mark} The obvious next question is why did a general
awareness of persistent problems and serial reforms to solve them fail
to improve Russian military effectiveness? ]{.underline}

The answer is that Russia's lack of military effectiveness in Ukraine
is, to a large degree, the product of unbalanced civil-military
relations. At the heart of civil-military relations is the need to
ensure that the military, as an organisation designed to "break things
and kill people," remains under civilian control while retaining the
autonomy necessary for making professional military judgement and
improving military effectiveness.

Russian civil-military relations have been complicated since the fall of
the Soviet Union. There was no coup, or even a military coup attempt in
that period despite a fairly autonomous military. Throughout the
post-Soviet period, the civilian leader, be it Yeltsin or Putin, has
maintained full political control of the armed forces, but that did not
always translate into effective civilian leadership.

[**[Russia's lack of strong civilian leadership of the military is at
the root of its military effectiveness problem.]{.mark}** Strong
civilian leadership does not guarantee successful reform, but [it is a
necessary condition for reform to happen.]{.mark} The quality of
political leadership defines as the extent of committed support among
key decision makers for a particular policy solution to a specific
problem. In the Russian case, the [president needs to appoint key
decision-makers such as the defence minister and his deputies, including
the chief of the general staff.]{.mark} These officials should share a
common understanding of a problem, have incentives and sufficient
resources to act, and sign off on official reform programmes, including
monitoring and evaluation criteria for assessing results.]{.underline}

Sometimes, strong civilian leadership has to reduce the autonomy of its
armed forces to force through necessary changes, other times it needs to
increase it. Regardless, an autonomous military under weak civilian
leadership will protect its institutional preferences too effectively,
undermining military responsiveness to internal constraints and the
dynamic external environment, as happened during the first eight years
of Putin's rule. A subservient military under weak civilian leadership
is a stagnant force but if it doesn't experience the test of combat, it
can still satisfy the needs of the civilian leadership.

[As the shown below, over this period the various Russian defence
ministers oscillated between creating an autonomous military and more a
subservient model. But in all cases [the persistent lack of civilian
leadership ensured that reform could not succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Russia's military remains fundamentally weakened by decades of failed reforms, weak civilian control, and a lack of coherent leadership.

**Shamiev 24 (**Kirill Shamiev is a policy fellow with the Wider Europe
programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations. He focuses on
Russia's civil-military relations and domestic politics and
policymaking, 15 May 2024, "Brass tacks: Why Russia's military fails to
reform,"
https://ecfr.eu/publication/brass-tacks-why-russias-military-fails-to-reform/#russia-and-its-military-state)
// GMemb

Most of the problems exposed by the Russian military in Ukraine are not
new. They have been visible and discussed since the collapse of the
Soviet Union, but the Russian state has made little progress in solving
them. [[Russia]{.mark} frequently [demonstrated poor integration of its
operational plan and combat tactics with loosely defined strategic
objectives, failed to properly train and prepare its troops for war, and
suffered serious procurement difficulties.]{.mark}]{.underline} These
problems were widely recognised and discussed by Russian military
theorists in the Russian Ministry of Defence official magazines.

One of the main reasons for Russia's slow military development is
civil-military relations. On the one hand, Russian politicians have
found it difficult to get the military to do what they want. [Despite
the growing power of the regime, [Putin]{.mark} has been [unable to
overcome the military's objections to the reforms he has initiated over
the past 22 years.]{.mark}]{.underline} For the first eight years, the
Russian military enjoyed substantial military autonomy and disagreed on
the priority and sequencing of changes. A brief period of intrusive and
forceful imposition of orders in 2008-2012 brought much resistance,
criticism, and avoidable mistakes that ultimately removed an unpopular
defence minister from office.

Developments since 2012 appear to have improved the balance of power
between civilians and the military[. However, [the lack of functional
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms]{.mark} (as opposed to intrusive
oversight), the [lack of civilian expertise in defence sector
development]{.mark}, coupled with the [lack of investment in military
education and training]{.mark}, and the [early successes in eastern
Ukraine and Syria, blinded Russian military reform.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [appointment of the new minister of defence will not make this task
easier.]{.mark} To implement the necessary changes, Belousov will have
to build his own team by appointing new deputy minsters of defence. The
positions of first deputy for financial and economic work, state
secretary for government relations, and deputies for the logistical
support, will be crucial for streamlining his work and ultimately
delivering the results. These officials will be spearheading the
management of the military's gigantic financial flows and adapting the
Russian legal system to the military's needs. They will also have to
establish positive working relationships with the general staff and
military-industrial representatives who may lack either the skills or
willingness to reform the system.]{.underline}

As an outsider to the military world, Belousov is likely to rely on the
chief of the general staff to enforce his reform aspirations among the
military. It is difficult to find a suitable candidate for this position
as this general should be highly experienced in managing (in
headquarters) and commanding (in the field) the military and possess
little political ambition. The current chief, Valery Gerasimov, has
already spent more than a decade serving as the chief of the general
staff, which is a record in Russia's post-Soviet history. He may not be
up to the scale and quality of the tasks that Belousov will have to
undertake. To curtail military autonomy, Belousov may need a younger and
obedient chief with war experience.

The level of military autonomy determines how loyal the military is in
implementing civilian decisions. Too much military autonomy creates the
need for a very capable and professional civilian leadership, otherwise
autonomy may produce a disloyal military that threatens the reform
efforts and can potentially endanger the entire state.

The quest for loyalty in Russia has a cascading effect. If the Kremlin
wants a loyal minister and chief of the general staff that would limit
the military autonomy, they will seek to surround themselves with loyal
senior military officers and Russian Ministry of Defence officials. That
high command then prefers reliable subordinates who will always carry
out its decisions, who then logically look for similarly obedient more
junior officers and officials. In the end, the natural desire to
surround oneself with trustworthy supporters contributes to the vicious
circle of finger-pointing and false reporting as everything depends on
the decision of the ultimate commander.

On the other hand, a completely autonomous force under weak civilian
leadership can potentially threaten the state, as Yevgeny Prigozhin's
mutiny demonstrated. Prigozhin's private military company, Wagner,
developed informally and outside the official defence sector and its
regulations. It became a highly autonomous paramilitary group whose
leadership challenged the Russian state. Clearly, the correct balance of
military autonomy is crucial for ensuring a loyal but functioning
military.

The war with Ukraine has naturally produced thousands of highly
experienced soldiers and commanders in the Russian military. This means
that the Kremlin now has a large pool of qualified military personnel
who can potentially significantly improve the Russian military. The
level of expertise in the Russian high command and Russian Ministry of
Defence leadership will determine whether the next reform addresses the
key components of military effectiveness[. However, [improving]{.mark}
the [education and training system in the Russian military]{.mark} will
[require decisive institutional changes, a radical overhaul of the
personnel system, and decades of stable military development to improve
Russian military culture.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even if the veterans of
the war in Ukraine can replace some commanders at several levels,
institutional changes without a chance of civilian leadership would be a
challenge for Russia.

[Even experienced military commanders need reliable information about
adversaries and new military developments, as well as evidence of their
own troops' readiness. [The quality of monitoring and evaluation
determines how well the Russian Ministry of Defence can identify
problems, monitor implementation, and evaluate the results of
reforms.]{.mark}]{.underline} The proliferation of information about the
Russian military partially solves this problem, but the outcome of the
war with Ukraine will determine whether this evidence will be about a
defeated or victorious military.

A Russian defeat in Ukraine without regime change in Moscow would make
radical reform more likely, while a success would more probably postpone
significant changes in the military again. Regardless**[[, Russia will
require strong and effective civilian leadership that can tolerate but
also control military autonomy to find balance in civil-military
relations and improve its military effectiveness.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Will Putin's new term bring this?

Russia has never had that type of civilian leadership in the post-Soviet
period. Paraphrasing a Russian idiom, Russian leaders speak with
Suvorov's flair, but their actions rarely match his daring.

sofia

[For all of]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin's]{.mark}
strategic blunders]{.underline} (none more harmful to Russia's long-term
interests than his decision to invade Ukraine), [his
**[sustained]{.mark} [support]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} a **closer**
relationship with [China]{.mark} **stands out** as a **[singular]{.mark}
[success]{.mark} story**.]{.underline} This [policy]{.underline} has in
fact proved [so successful]{.underline} that [it will]{.underline}
likely [[persist]{.underline}]{.mark} [even after Putin's **eventual
departure**]{.underline} [[regardless]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} whatever changes his successor might make to
repair [Russia's broken relations with the
**[West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 

This does not mean that the United States has no leverage in this
relationship. But Washington needs to decide whether it would benefit
more from seeing the Russians forced into the Chinese embrace, or from
tempting Russia away from China through political and economic
incentives. 

It\'s not uncommon to think of the **[Sino-Russian
alignment]{.underline}** as a [[**personal project** of Putin's
and]{.mark} his Chinese counterpart [Xi]{.mark} Jinping's]{.underline}.
But the [roots]{.underline} of this project [go much
deeper]{.underline}. [Moscow and Beijing]{.underline} [have been on
a]{.underline} generally [[uninterrupted]{.mark} [positive
trajectory]{.mark} since the mid-1980s]{.underline}. Aided by [a
**shared** normative understanding of global **[politics]{.mark}**,
strong **[trade]{.mark}** ties]{.underline} (see tables below)
[and]{.underline} a [wealth]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [accumulated
experience of respectful]{.underline}---if not always
friction-free---[cooperation]{.underline} in regional and international
forums, this relationship [is]{.underline}, all things considered, quite
[healthy]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} is [likely to stay
so]{.underline} for the foreseeable future. Indeed, [occasional
dissenters notwithstanding]{.underline}, there seems to be a [broad
policy consensus in China and Russia]{.underline} (extending far beyond
the top leadership) [that the current state of the relationship
objectively **[benefits]{.mark} [both]{.mark} countries**. ]{.underline}

[To understand why this relationship is so robust,]{.underline} it is
[helpful to remember that it wasn't always so. Moscow and Beijing
famously quarreled in the late 1950s]{.underline}. Their Communist
alliance cratered amid [mutual accusations]{.underline} of ideological
heresy, and suspicions of aggressive intent. Suffice it to recall that
in 1969, the two countries fought an [undeclared border
war]{.underline}. The Soviets feared that the Chinese would overwhelm
their poorly defended positions in Siberia and the Far East, and
hurriedly amassed forces along the border, even while hinting at the
possibility of a pre-emptive nuclear strike against China. 

The Chinese, for their part, eyed their Soviet neighbors warily, and dug
tunnels under Beijing. Mutual trade---once vibrant---ground to an almost
complete stop. People-to-people exchanges ceased altogether.
[For]{.underline} years---[decades]{.underline} even---[China and the
USSR were at each other's throats]{.underline}, a fact profitably
exploited by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger in their skillful
"triangular" diplomacy. 

Consider what has been accomplished [since then. Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline} have now **[resolved]{.underline}** their
[territorial disputes, and the border has been demarcated]{.underline}.
There is [no evidence that the Chinese]{.underline} [consider the
territories]{.underline} that [the Qing Empire]{.underline} had [lost to
Russia]{.underline} in the nineteenth century [as]{.underline}
potentially [recoverable]{.underline}, and even if this were so, it is
unclear how these territories could be recovered short of a suicidal
war. 

Contrary to some uninformed opinion, there has [never been a threat of
Chinese migrants overwhelming Russia's underpopulated
periphery,]{.underline} partly because such [migration is economically
unattractive to the Chinese,]{.underline} and in part due to prohibitive
administrative and cultural barriers. 

In stark contrast to the 1960s and the 1970s, the [border between the
two neighbors is practically undefended.]{.underline} The
[Russians]{.underline} [downgraded]{.underline} their [military
presence]{.underline} in the Sino-Russian border area, for instance, by
redeploying units of the Fifth Combined Arms Army to the frontline in
Ukraine, [leaving themselves exposed to China in a way that the Soviets
would have found jarring]{.underline}. Such
**[[demilitarization]{.underline}]{.mark}** has, however, [contributed
to the **[build]{.mark}-[up]{.mark}** of
**[trust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [accentuated]{.underline} also
[by]{.underline} the [growing military-to-military contacts and joint
exercises in waters]{.underline} as far away from China as
the Mediterranean Sea, [and joint patrols with long-range
nuclear-capable bombers.]{.underline}

[Russia and China]{.underline} have [learned to **[work]{.mark}
[together profitably]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
long-derided and unarguably ineffective forums like [the
**[S]{.mark}**hanghai **[C]{.mark}**ooperation **[O]{.mark}**rganization
[and **BRICS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if these organizations have
not accomplished much, they have nevertheless offered a platform for
coordinating policy agendas and, with luck, enticing the Global South
into offering a half-hearted endorsement of the same. 

Additionally, the [current]{.underline} [renaissance in Sino-Russian
ties has a **firm economic basis**.]{.underline} [[Bilateral]{.mark}
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline} [reached \$245 billion in 2024]{.underline}.
It has been [growing]{.underline} [by leaps]{.underline} and bounds
[since]{.underline} the Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} (when
it was about \$147 billion).1 This increase was mostly (but not
exclusively) driven by Russia's reorientation from its Western trade
partners, a consequence of Western sanctions. [Russia has become China's
**leading [supplier]{.mark}** [of **energy**]{.mark}. China]{.underline}
has [made strides as Russia's key supplier of **[industrial]{.mark}
[machinery]{.mark}**, cars [and]{.mark} consumer
[electronics]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

It is unlikely that Sino-Russian trade will continue to grow at the
extraordinary rate it has grown in recent years: Russia's need for
Chinese tech and consumer goods, and China's ability to absorb Russia's
oil and gas, are not limitless. There are also technologies---including
some advanced chips---that China cannot provide, and that Russia must
therefore smuggle from the West. Even though **[trade]{.underline}**
does not preclude conflict and even wars (Sino-Soviet economic
ties---which cratered in the 1960s---being a case in point), it
[provides the political relationship with a certain ballast and a degree
of inertia that **[mitigate]{.mark}** against **[sudden]{.mark} policy
[shifts]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

Some critics have argued that [Russia]{.underline} has become overly
[dependent on China's market]{.underline}, or, even China's vassal. Such
criticism is unsubstantiated. First, the fact that Russia sells oil and
natural gas to China does not make it China's "vassal" any more than
selling oil and natural gas to Europe made Russia's Europe's "vassal."
Yes, being unduly dependent on one buyer is not in Russia's long-term
interest (clearly, it would be to Moscow's benefit if it could also sell
its resources to the Europeans). It is also true that developing a
dependence on China's electronics can be problematic (but Russia is
hardly the only country that has developed such a dependence---much of
the world suffers from the same predicament).

Second, [China's economic leverage]{.underline}---such as it is---is not
the kind of leverage that Beijing can profitably use to extract
political concessions. The [Chinese are known to resort to **economic
coercion**, especially against weaker partners.]{.underline} But [there
are **[no instances]{.mark}** yet [of]{.mark}
[Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[attempting to
coerce]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} through
economic means. Beijing's propensity to drive a hard bargain (as is
evident in the moribund negotiations over the Power of Siberia 2
pipeline) is not in itself evidence of coercion. It is risky to coerce
Russia, since such attempts could damage the bilaterial relationship
irreparably, and [China needs a good relationship with Russia no less
than the other way around]{.underline}. [Recent history of]{.underline}
the application of [sanctions]{.underline} against Russia (mainly by
Western countries) [does not offer particularly encouraging lessons as
to their efficacy. ]{.underline}

All in all, [China and Russia]{.underline} have [managed to build a
**mutually profitable relationship**]{.underline} that is, broadly,
[in]{.underline} [both countries' interest]{.underline}. This success is
a [major improvement on earlier]{.underline}, more confrontational
periods, in Sino-Russian and Sino-Soviet [relations]{.underline}.
[Both]{.underline} [have learned]{.underline} from this complicated
history, [and are **[determined]{.mark}** [not to repeat]{.mark}
**[past]{.mark} [mistakes]{.mark}. **]{.underline}

[Does this mean that the relationship is friction-free? No. Frictions
remain]{.underline}. Russia jealously watches China's moves in Central
Asia and the Arctic. China is not entirely happy with the way the
Russians have fought their war in Ukraine (Xi has repeatedly voiced
concerns over the possibility of nuclear escalation). Russia is
frustrated with China's hard bargaining in economic talks. The Chinese
aren't too pleased about Russia's flirtation with North Korea, long
deemed by Beijing to lie within China's sphere of influence. Such
frictions are probably inevitable in any relationship. The [real
question is how they]{.underline} [are managed]{.underline}. The
[Chinese and the Russians have so far **managed** their **frictions
well**]{.underline}---[much better]{.underline}, it should be said,
[than America]{.underline} is currently managing its own alliances
([though this is indeed a very low bar). ]{.underline}

Russia and China have not become allies, but nor is this necessary.
Alliances require commitments and reduce one's space for maneuver. Both
countries need this space. So they have come together, but not in a
close embrace. And this is a strategically sensible position in this
increasingly confusing, chaotic world. 

Where does all of this leave the United States? [It is
**[unlikely]{.mark}** that the **[U.S. will succeed in]{.mark} [driving
a wedge]{.mark} between Moscow and Beijing**]{.underline}. The
[**[commonality]{.mark}** of interests between the two is **[too]{.mark}
[great]{.mark}** to permit it.]{.underline} Yet it is possible that by
offering political and economic incentives to Russia---for instance, by
effectively giving up on Ukraine and normalizing relations with
Russia---the Trump Administration could encourage the Russians to at
least stay neutral in any future Sino-American confrontation. The
Kremlin badly wants re-engagement, not least because it would provide
Putin with greater leverage vis-à-vis Beijing. 

Yet such an American strategy will likely require unpalatable policy
shifts (abandoning Ukraine) and will undoubtedly cause strain for U.S.
relationships in Europe. 

The alternative would be to abandon the idea of "incentivizing" Russia
and focus instead on driving Moscow further into China's embrace on the
reasonable premise that the Russians will not be happy with such a
situation and may therefore consider concessions on their part to
re-engage with the West. The result would be the same, but the costs to
America's interests and reputation would probably be considerably
lower. 

Whatever policy it chooses to pursue, the United States must remain
realistic about the extent of American leverage, understanding that
[[Russia]{.mark}, never mind [China]{.mark}, [will **never** be
**America's to win or lose**]{.mark}, and that there are many reasons
for Russia to have a **good relationship** with China
**[regardless]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} what happens or fails to happen
between these two countries and the **[West]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Russia's **objectives** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}:

[Since the early imperial]{.underline} period, [[discourses surrounding
**Arctic**]{.mark} **exploration** and **nationalism** have [been
**integral** to Russian state]{.mark}craft [and]{.mark} the construction
of **[national identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This engagement can be
[traced back to the reign of **Peter the Great** and has **persisted**
through the **Soviet era**]{.underline}, during which [the Arctic was
consistently framed as a **region** of both **strategic** and **symbolic
importance**]{.underline}. [The enduring centrality]{.underline} of the
Arctic in Russian political thought is [[evident in]{.mark} various
**[historical junctures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, most notably in the
transformative policy shift initiated by General Secretary Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1987. In his seminal Murmansk speech, Gorbachev proposed
the Arctic as a "zone of peace" and international cooperation, calling
for the creation of a regional framework for environmental protection,
the demilitarization of the region, the establishment of a nuclear-free
zone, and limitations on military naval operations. This marked a
significant departure from the militarized posture of earlier Soviet
Arctic policy, signaling a new alignment between geopolitical strategy
and emergent environmental concerns.

In the [post-Soviet]{.underline} era, [the Arctic]{.underline} again
[became a **focal point** of Russian **strategic thinking**
as]{.underline} President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} explicitly
[reaffirmed]{.mark} the region's **[importance]{.mark}** to Russia's
**national security**]{.underline}. Over the past two decades, [Putin
has]{.underline} consistently [advanced a **narrative** that positions
the **Arctic** as a **fundamental component** of Russian **national
identity** and **sovereignty**]{.underline}. In a 2014 session of the
National Security Council, he [[described the Arctic as
embodying]{.underline}]{.mark} "practically **[[all aspects of national
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[military]{.underline},
[political]{.underline}, [economic]{.underline},
[technological]{.underline}, [environmental]{.underline}, [and that of
resources]{.underline}, thereby [underscoring the **comprehensive** and
**multidimensional nature** of its strategic value]{.underline}. In
2020, the [[Kremlin unveiled]{.underline}]{.mark} the "**[[Arctic
2035]{.underline}]{.mark}**″ plan, which addresses infrastructure
financing, economic expansion, and strategic importance for national
security in the Arctic region considering increased economic strains and
geopolitical threats.

[[Russia's]{.mark} Arctic [approach is]{.mark} influenced by
**[Eurasianist ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which posits that
Russia occupies a **unique** civilizational space **[distinct
from]{.mark} Europe** and should therefore pursue its developmental path
**independent** of [**Western norms** and
**values**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One of the principal
ideologues]{.underline} of this perspective [is]{.underline} Aleksandr
[Dugin]{.underline}, also referred to as "**[Putin's
Rasputin]{.underline}**." He opined that there is a close relation
between the Arctic and Eurasianism, as he considers the former as a
northern frontier of the Eurasian heartland, which is integral to the
creation of a cohesive Eurasian identity. [This **ideological
grounding** [provides]{.mark} Russia with a **powerful discursive** and
**strategic tool** for asserting influence in the Arctic]{.underline},
[enabling it to negotiate from [a **position of
strength**]{.mark}]{.underline} in regional and international forums.

For the Russian Federation, [[the Arctic constitutes]{.mark}
a]{.underline} region of [**profound** geopolitical and strategic
significance]{.underline}. Alexandr [Dugin referred to the]{.underline}
Siberian [North as [Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[geopolitical
reserve]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [Moreover]{.underline}, the
[Russia]{.underline}n state [has]{.underline} re[[interpreted]{.mark}
the perceived isolation]{.underline} and underdevelopment of its
[Arctic]{.underline} territories (Murmansk, Yamal-Nenets region, etc.)
[[as a]{.underline}]{.mark} form of "**[spiritual
plus]{.underline}**"---[a **[metaphysical advantage]{.mark}**
that]{.underline}, [when combined with **cutting-edge
tech**nologies]{.underline}, [is envisioned as the foundation [for
**establishing**]{.mark} **Eurasian [dominance over]{.mark}** what is
portrayed as [the]{.mark}]{.underline} moral and spiritual vacuity of
the **[[West]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This]{.underline} synthesis of
traditionalism and technological modernity [reflects a **broader
narrative** of **Russian exceptionalism** within the **Arctic**
discourse]{.underline}.

[In a **highly symbolic act**]{.underline} intended to assert its
sovereignty and geopolitical presence in the Arctic, [[Russia
**planted** a **national flag**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the seabed
beneath the North Pole in 2007, utilizing the MIR-1 submersible to carry
out the operation. [This gesture]{.underline}, while largely ceremonial,
[[underscores the]{.mark} **strategic [importance]{.mark}** the
Arcti]{.underline}c holds [[in]{.mark} the Kremlin's broader pursuit of
**[derzhavnost]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the aspiration to
**re-establish** Russia as a **formidable global power**]{.underline}.
The restoration of great power status remains a cornerstone of Russia's
foreign policy doctrine, and the Arctic has emerged as a critical arena
through which Moscow seeks to project this vision.

[[The Arctic is]{.mark} **significant** for [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
internal [[**legitimization** of]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark}'s leadership]{.underline}, as [it provides a
**platform** [for]{.mark} the consolidation of **national identity** and
[the **revival** of **patriotic sentiment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, both
of which contribute to the. Thus, [the Arctic is]{.underline} being
[**instrumentalized** as a **geopolitical** and **ideological
frontier**]{.underline}, where [domestic narratives of
pride]{.underline} and sovereignty [intersect with Russia's **global
ambitions**]{.underline}. Contemporary [[Russian]{.mark} Arctic [policy
is]{.mark}]{.underline} characterized by [a **[dual
rhetorical]{.mark}**]{.underline} approach. Domestically, [the Kremlin
adopts a more **assertive** and **[nationalistic
discourse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [emphasizing sovereignty and great
power status]{.underline}. Conversely, in international forums,
[Russia]{.underline} often [[**presents itself** as]{.underline}]{.mark}
a [[cooperative]{.underline}]{.mark} actor committed to multilateral
engagement and peaceful regional governance. [This
bifurcated]{.underline} communication [strategy enables Moscow [to
**advance**]{.mark} its **national [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}
while simultaneously cultivating an image of responsible stewardship in
the Arctic.

[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} economic investment and [[**military**

[[Moscow is **actively militarizing** the region]{.underline}]{.mark},
HUR reports. [Russia's war]{.underline} in Ukraine [has underscored the
**strategic importance** of]{.underline} autonomous, decentralized, and
mobile [communications]{.underline}---something Russian forces lacked in
early 2022, leading to chaos. Ukrainian forces, in contrast, adapted
quickly using Starlink terminals.

One key focus for Russia is now communication. Along its northern
border, Russia is installing satellite communication systems that could
coordinate operations of its Northern Fleet and support drone activity
in the Arctic. This initiative includes efforts by various research
institutes to develop domestic systems independent of Western
components---essentially a Russian version of Starlink.

At the same time, [Russia is [expanding]{.mark} its **[regional military
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[constructing **new nuc**]{.mark}lear
**[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}** capable of [carrying
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, building infrastructure,
[[and **adapting weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Arctic's extreme
cold.

As global attention remains centered on war in Ukraine and the Middle
East, [Russia is [acting with **minimal scrutiny**]{.mark} in the
north]{.underline}. There is growing discussion about [Moscow's
[**interest** in]{.mark} the **[Svalbard]{.mark} archipelago** [as a
**strategic target**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another key factor to consider in the Arctic threat delta is the
evolving relationship between Moscow and Beijing in circumpolar affairs.
Beijing has been a permanent observer at the Arctic Council since 2013
and unveiled its official regional intentions in the 2018 Arctic White
Paper, where it described China as a '"near-Arctic state" (for which it
received pushback from the Arctic 8).

[[China's contestation of international maritime norms presents a
challenge to Arctic stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Understanding and
assessing Beijing's policies and approaches in relation to both poles is
essential as the Arctic 7 seek greater transparency and stability in the
Arctic. China's polar activities are an integral part of China's
economic diversification strategy as part of the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) for access to energy and fossil fuels, fishing stocks,
commerce, passage, etc. [[Beijing]{.mark}, therefore, has an [interest
in imposing]{.mark} its [revisionist views on future governance,
especially in]{.mark} the context of [the opening of the Central Arctic
Ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline} And it finds a ready partner in Moscow to
contest established norms of regional governance by imposing its own
interpretation of what will ultimately serve Beijing's interests
(ironically at the expense of Russia's Arctic sovereignty).

[There is a growing expectation that [Beijing]{.mark} will seek to
[increase its commercial, and]{.mark} therefore its [military, footprint
in the Arctic through agreements with Russia]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
eventual [ambition to project and sustain]{.mark} its [economic and
military power]{.mark} there (the fulfillment of its "near-Arctic" state
ambitions).]{.underline} The PLAN started operating in an Arctic
environment as early as 2015, with its first naval deployment in the
Bering Sea. Beijing now operates two scientific research stations in the
European Arctic (in Ny Ålesund on Svalbard and in Iceland), with a
willingness to open a third station in Greenland and a thwarted attempt
to open a station in Canada.

[[China's regional economic presence and scientific
infrastructure]{.mark} are likely to be [dual-purpose]{.mark} by nature
-- outfitted for military intelligence gathering and greater Arctic
domain awareness.]{.underline} Beijing's focus appears to be on the
Northern Sea Route where, during a March 2023 state visit to Moscow, the
two countries agreed to form a joint organization for the development
and transit management of the NSR, as the Chinese shipping company COSCO
is the primary international user of the NSR since 2013. China seeks
alternative global shipping routes. Although China does not yet have an
operational cold-water fleet, the PLAN is investing in Arctic-specific
surface and sub-surface capabilities. [**[China]{.mark} is also
[building]{.mark} a [new class of nuclear-powered icebreakers under PLAN
specifications]{.mark},** notably to support nuclear submarine
operations against US deployments.]{.underline} There might be a point
where the quantity of Chinese assets matches, if not outpaces, those of
other Arctic powers.

[The [recent signing of]{.mark} a [Memorandum of Understanding]{.mark}
between the Russian FSB and China's coastguards strengthened joint
maritime security efforts, and **[raised concerns about]{.mark} the
[potential for further military cooperation]{.mark}** between the two
countries.]{.underline} [Indeed, through their joint naval exercises and
sub-threshold activities, Russia and China have clearly demonstrated
their willingness to deepen military collaboration in the
Arctic.]{.underline} In 2021, the highly publicized Maritime Interaction
exercise in the Western Pacific Ocean garnered attention for its overt
anti-submarine warfare drills. More recently, joint naval exercises in
late July 2023 included a submarine search-and-destroy drill in the
Bering Sea, and in early August, the two countries carried out a
provocative joint naval patrol near Alaska. This joint regional
posturing has implications also for US theater missile defense presence
(Aegis Ashore and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system). These
developments should be urgently addressed by US and allied policymakers.

However, China's increased presence in the Arctic can only occur with
support from Moscow as well as the Arctic 7. Today, Moscow is a
"gatekeeper" to Beijing's access to the Russian Arctic in the Pacific
and the Northern Sea Route. [But the Kremlin's economic needs and
China's support for its foreign and security policy may require Moscow
to incrementally cede some of its Arctic sovereignty to Beijing as a
cost to maintain its international status.]{.underline} Over time and
with the acceleration of climate change in the Arctic, Beijing will have
less interest in developing Russia's Northern Sea Route and instead,
seek greater access to the Central Arctic Ocean through the Transpolar
Sea Route where, in the future, it could seek to access deep seabed
mining and fisheries stock.

Sino-Russian Arctic relations are as defined by collaboration as they
are by mistrust. Beijing will prolong negotiations to seek the lowest
cost possible for its investments which is why Moscow is so irked by the
scarcity of Chinese investments in the Russian Arctic to develop NSR and
energy infrastructure. While China wants others to be economically
dependent on it, it assiduously avoids becoming overly dependent on
Russian energy or access for passage and transit. Russia is focused on
protecting and projecting its sovereignty in the Arctic; while China is
eager to secure unfettered access to the Arctic, which is why it seeks
both multilateral and bilateral approaches to assure continued access.
Beijing will continue to pressure the Kremlin for concessions on Arctic
energy exports and NSR development to help sustain the Russian economy.
Moscow would then have no other choice than to concede to China (at very
low cost) more presence in its Arctic which will in turn make the
Kremlin more insecure about its sovereignty.

[Overall, while Russia's presence and posture in the Arctic have not
fundamentally changed in the context of the war in Ukraine, there is a
[new geopolitical reality]{.mark} in [which]{.mark} its [Arctic
presence]{.mark} (as well as the US Arctic presence), must be [assessed
to more effectively deter Moscow in an era of "low to no
collaboration."]{.mark}]{.underline}
