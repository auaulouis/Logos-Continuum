# CP\-\--Arctic Environmental Impact Statement\-\--Michigan Starter Packet

### Notes

This is an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) counterplan. Other
terms you will see include Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and
Environmental Assessment (EA). These are all largely the same thing for
our purposes. An "Impact Assessment" counterplan studies the aff and
only does it if there won't be some specific impact. For an EIS, that
impact is environmental. The plan will happen if and only if it won't be
unavoidably catastrophic to the environment.

The guidelines in the counterplan text are referenced in the first 1NC
card, DiMento & Pierucci 25. It's a series of best practices that we'll
say are key to effective governance. Any legit perm doesn't meet those
guidelines, which means it can't solve the net benefit.

The net benefit is that the US mandating a prior and binding EIS that
meets international guidelines for the Arctic results in Arctic
cooperation, including input from Indigenous locals. Arctic governance
based in cooperation that includes input form Indigenous locals sets a
global model for managing a litany of impacts.

There are good aff answers in this file. You can add aff-specific
process CP answers if you'd like. The 1AR non-binding perm block
includes args that the CP can't solve the case or the net benefit, but
those args can probably apply for any perm you'd go for so feel free to
choose to extend a different perm based on what makes sense to you. The
2AR should go for some perm solves the nb or at least any relevant risk
of it, CP can't solve the net benefit, CP can't solve at least some part
of the aff, and the part of the aff the CP can't solve outweighs a
residual risk of the net benefit.

This file is heavily highlighted, except for some cards which aren't
highlighted at all and one card which isn't even underlined. Some of the
tags are way too long. Some of the tags include non-bolded sections.
Those are explanatory and don't have to be read. If you want to read
this CP on the neg, you'll have to do a little bit of work to get it
ready because I wanted to err on the side of explaining over
deployability.

3\. [[Mandate]{.mark} More [In-depth Environmental Studies]{.mark} and
[in More Cases]{.mark}]{.underline} Now, [Arctic regions face
**[increasingly significant development pressures]{.mark}**, including
proposed large-scale projects, such as international airports, ports,
and energy production facilities]{.underline}. There is a new scale of
the proposed project; [[new actors]{.mark} are involved or [want to be
involved]{.mark}, and **[new impacts result]{.mark}** from the changing
climate]{.underline}. What's more, [[geo-engineering projects
that]{.mark} can [have major environmental effects]{.mark} have moved
from the mostly opposed idea stage to [attract]{.mark}ing [major funding
for]{.mark} in-depth [research]{.mark} and possible
trials]{.underline}.188

[[These]{.mark} changes [suggest the need for more]{.mark}]{.underline}
environmental impact analysis [[and greater depth of]{.mark}
environmental analysis]{.underline} in those already required.
[Environmental impact assessment (**[EIA]{.mark}**) is widely undertaken
**[in Arctic nations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[However, **there are some [gaps in the EIA]{.mark} framework that
[limit]{.mark} its [effectiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "Although
international legal norms apply to the region, **[[the Arctic lacks a
coherent EIA]{.mark} system, [and the development of Arctic-specific EIA
norms does not seem to be a priority in Arctic
governance."]{.mark}]{.underline}**189 [Now there exists "a complex and
overlapping constellation of international, regional and domestic
requirements that **balances** project **development activities** with
regard to environmental protection and social impacts]{.underline}."190
[To be sure, there is applicable international treaty law,]{.underline}
like the Espoo Convention.191 [Arctic States have domestic EIA
law]{.underline}. The AC and its precursor, the Arctic Environmental
Protection Strategy (AES), offered "examples of good practices to
enhance the quality of EIAs and harmonize EIA" procedures across the
Arctic, both in domestic and transboundary contexts.192 In 1997 the
Arctic States in the Alta Declaration received "with appreciation the
'Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the Arctic' and
the 'Arctic Offshore Oil and Gas Guidelines' developed under the AEPS,
and agree\[d\] that these Guidelines be applied."193 Among the
appreciations at the time, these [[guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
the first time, [[focus]{.mark}ed [on]{.mark} [issues]{.mark} that are
[particular to the Arctic]{.mark}---[**damage to permafrost**
and]{.mark} inclusion of **[t]{.mark}**raditional **[k]{.mark}**nowledge
in assessment]{.underline}---among others.194 However, critics note that
the "1997 **[[EIA Guidelines have had]{.mark} close to [no impact on
domestic legislations]{.mark}."]{.underline}**195 [More recently in
2019, [an AC document addressed "good practices"]{.mark} and "meaningful
engagement with recommendations for large-scale
projects]{.underline}."196 [[These recognize]{.mark} the [specific
characteristics of the Arctic environment]{.mark}, [underscore the need
for input from Indigenous peoples]{.mark} and locals, [and encourage
States]{.mark} to apply the principles of the Espoo Convention [to
increase coop]{.mark}eration [across the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.197
[[Nonetheless]{.mark}, the 2019 document "suffer\[s\] from the [same
weaknesses]{.mark} as the 1997 EIA Guidelines" [provid]{.mark}ing **[no
"oversight" nor "compliance]{.mark} mechanisms."**]{.underline}198
Finally, Arctic EU members Denmark, Finland, and Sweden must comply with
EU standards.199

[[While the US has been a pioneer in]{.mark} developing
[EIA]{.mark}]{.underline} and the EU has been a leader in articulating
its commitment to the great importance of environmental assessments,
[[greater attention to]{.mark} the application of [EIA in the Arctic is
needed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Among foci]{.underline} that both
[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[can foster]{.mark} are the
**[dissemination of EIA best practices]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
large-scale [projects]{.mark}, land-use **[planning]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} EIA integration, regional environmental analysis, and
sustainability analysis, which includes socioeconomic
conditions.]{.underline}200 Also, "[EIA can be made stronger by
including assessment not only of hard or quantitative, but also
qualitative, value-based, and sometimes interpretive contributions.
\[And\] impact assessment should be done for privately negotiated
agreements]{.underline}."201

Further, [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} EU and the [[US can play roles in
requiring assessments]{.mark} to include impacts on biodiversity, use of
traditional knowledge, understanding of socio-cultural impact, and an
expansive reading of the public, including those who live in places
remote from the "lead agency," that is the manager of the EIA
process]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic sits at the lead]{.mark}ing edge [of]{.mark} some of [the
most pressing problems the world faces]{.mark}
today]{.underline}---[coping with]{.underline} the growing and
socioeconomically uneven impacts of **[[climate]{.mark}
change]{.underline}**; [finding an appropriate **balance between**
economic **[development and conservation]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [and
**coordinating [governance]{.mark}** [across]{.mark} local, regional,
and international [boundaries]{.mark}---all made more challenging by
increasing **[populism]{.mark}** and distrust of government, renewed
**[great-power competition]{.mark}**, rising **[geopolitical
tensions]{.mark}**, and fears about the **[stability of]{.mark} the**
rules-based **[international order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In the
Arctic, as in the rest of the world, these [issues are complex,
interconnected, and compounding]{.mark} each other]{.underline}. In what
follows, we elaborate on [[three central issues:]{.underline}]{.mark}
[current scientific [understanding]{.mark} of the regional and **global
impacts of Arctic [climate]{.mark} change,**]{.underline}
[[ensuring]{.mark} that Arctic [research addresses]{.mark} the [needs
of]{.mark} Arctic [peoples]{.mark} and communities]{.underline},
**[[and]{.mark} the importance of [sustaining Arctic coop]{.mark}eration
[in challenging geopolitical times]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Because [temperatures in the [Arctic]{.mark} are increasing
approximately three times faster than the global average]{.underline}
(1), the [interacting [impacts]{.mark} in this region
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a way, **[[advance notice of]{.mark} what
awaits the rest of [the world]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as global
temperatures continue to rise]{.underline}. [But there are more
immediate reasons that what happens in the Arctic should be of interest
to the wider world.]{.underline} [Rapid climate change in the Far North
is responsible for ever-larger wild[fires]{.mark} that are
[send]{.mark}ing smoke into midlatitudes]{.underline} (2); [it is
contributing to the increased frequency and magnitude of [extreme
weather]{.mark} events [across the]{.mark} Northern
[Hemisphere]{.mark}]{.underline} (3); [[and]{.mark} it is
[add]{.mark}ing to [sea-level rise]{.mark} around the world]{.underline}
(1). Furthermore, [**climate change in [the Arctic is a driver of
international]{.mark} tension and [conflict]{.mark}** [over]{.mark}
terms of access to Arctic Ocean [resources and]{.mark} the management of
the sea [routes]{.mark} that are opening up as sea ice shrinks, which
could [add to a]{.mark}n already [vexing geopolitical
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline} (4).

[More [positive]{.mark} reasons for [global interest]{.mark} in the
Arctic also exist]{.underline}. [These [include]{.mark}]{.underline} the
global [recognition and [respect for the region's Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}, distinctive wildlife, and fragile lands and waters; the
role [the]{.mark} Far North [need]{.mark}s [to]{.mark} play as a
**[lead]{.mark}er in [climate adaptation]{.mark}**
strategies]{.underline}; [and the Arctic's history of **[developing
innovative governance mechanisms that prioritize]{.mark} the [engagement
of Indigenous peoples]{.mark}** and other Arctic residents]{.underline}
(1, 4--6). [Notable as well has been the region's history of
[**leveraging research and science diplomacy**,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[through]{.mark} institutions such as **[the Arctic Council]{.mark}**
and the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the
Central Arctic Ocean, [to **support sustainable development, resource
management, and environmental protection** across
borders]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Development projects]{.underline}]{.mark} are expected to [[have
beneficial effects]{.mark} on health and well-being because they create
jobs and provide other economic benefits that contribute to a better
standard of living]{.underline}. Although there are exceptions,
[economic well-being has been repeatedly linked with longevity and other
indicators of health]{.underline} because people with adequate incomes
can afford to eat balanced diets and live healthier lifestyles.
[[However]{.mark}, [development]{.mark} projects [also have the capacity
to cause adverse effects]{.mark} on health and wellbeing at the
individual and community levels. Sometimes these effects are experienced
by people who do not share in the project's benefits]{.underline}.

[One of the negative effects that can be associated with projects is
related to physical health,]{.underline} such as mortality and morbidity
from disease and injury. [Social and community health may also be
affected negatively when individuals face a loss of cultural identity
and quality of life, social disruption and violence, and a breakdown of
community and family support networks as a result of a development
project. Furthermore, socio-cultural well-being can be affected by
increasing stress, anxiety, and feelings of alienation]{.underline}.

[[Indigenous communities that may be]{.mark} directly [affected
by]{.mark} a [development]{.mark} project, program or policy [should be
involved from the outset in]{.mark} the impact assessment conducted for
that project, program or policy]{.underline}. [[Their]{.mark} close
[connection to]{.mark} and additional reliance on the natural
environment make Indigenous peoples especially concerned with the
healthy preservation of that environment]{.underline}. **[[Creating
changes in a community without learning from it, or knowing what the
impacts of those changes were, can generate uncertainties within the
community]{.mark} leading to a loss of control over and deterioration of
the quality of life and health of the community]{.underline}**.

[[Whether beneficial or negative, it is important to understand, assess
and respond]{.mark} to changes and prevent or enhance them as
appropriate]{.underline}. [Indigenous communities might notice a marked
decrease in their quality of life and health, yet be incapable of
determining when or from what processes these changes emerged. On the
other hand, their quality of life may have improved; yet,
[without]{.mark} the [knowledge of]{.mark} just [where and when]{.mark}
these [improvements began, enhancing]{.mark} [such changes]{.mark} or
duplicating them in the future or in other communities [may prove
difficult]{.mark}, and attempts to do so may be
counterproductive]{.underline}.

A pan-Indigenous approach to consultations is not really appropriate.
Although FN and Inuit peoples share a number of common cultural traits
and values, each Nation or people has many distinctive beliefs, laws,
customs, and traditions complete with local variations (Obomsawin,
2007). When Indigenous knowledge is used in its original context, and in
partnership with western science-based knowledge, the combination is
often much more powerful a tool than either used alone. It is not,
however, an easy process, and within the field of EIA/HIA significantly
more work is needed. Environmental health professionals are rapidly
broadening their viewpoint from being focused on the traditional
bio-physical health (clean air, water, food and soil) to a practice of
ensuring well-being and overall health of the community, thereby
fulfilling the WHO 1967 and 1984 definitions of health. This changing
perspective matches the attitudes of many Indigenous practices.

Impact and Influence [Efficiency is a valid concern, particularly for
development proponents, but more attention needs to be given to
understanding the impact of EA on **decisions about development** in the
Arctic and the contribution of EA to improved environmental
management]{.underline}. **[[There has been]{.mark} some
[limited]{.mark} reporting on the [impact of Arctic EA on decision
]{.mark}]{.underline}**outcome**[[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[Ehrlich]{.underline} (2010), for example, [addressed the "weighing of
evidence" with respect to the assessment of spiritual issues and the
role it played [in]{.mark} the **[rejection]{.mark} of three projects
[and]{.mark} [conditional approval]{.mark} of another**]{.underline} in
Canada's Arctic. **[However]{.underline}**, Hansen (2011) argues that
apart from securing traditional environmental knowledge, **[[there is
little]{.mark} evidence that [EA]{.mark} in the Arctic has
[influence]{.mark}d decision making.]{.underline}**

In [the]{.underline} Finnish context, Hildén and Jalonen (2005) report
[limited influence of EA on decision-making and development
choices]{.underline}, and Pölönen (2006) [concludes that]{.underline}
both the EU Directive and the Finnish EA [[legislation fail to
**guarantee**]{.mark} the successful **[transfer of]{.mark} assessment
[results to decision]{.mark} making**]{.underline}. Hokkanen (2001)
reports that [a significant amount of raw information is generated
through]{.underline} Finnish [EA, but [there is **insufficient time to
use** ]{.mark}**the resulting knowledge**]{.underline}; and Jalava et
al. (2010) report that Finnish EAs suffer from irrelevant
[[info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation reported in a lengthy way, which may
serve to confuse and obscure essential points.

Impact and influence have been long-standing issues under Russia's EA
system (Cherp and Golubeva, 2012). Von Ritter and Tsirkunov (2003), for
example, found that [the [EA]{.mark} system in Russia has [had limited
impact on]{.mark} project [design]{.mark}, aside from cases of highly
visible and internationally financed projects.]{.underline} Reported
among the reasons for the limited influence is the poor quality of
baseline environmental data, the limited capacities of EA regions to
implement regulatory requirements, and [the [late prep]{.mark}aration of
EAs]{.underline}---[often **[after important]{.mark} project [decisions
have been made]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While these reasons may
[[reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} institutional and political
[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} within the Russian context, similar
problems may be observed in other Arctic jurisdictions (e.g., MVEIRB,
2005; McCrank, 2008; Olsen and Hansen, 2014).

[**[E]{.mark}**nvironmental **[a]{.mark}**ssessment
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} broadly defined as [[a process for]{.mark}
identifying, predicting, [evaluating,]{.mark} and mitigating the
biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of [development]{.mark}
[proposals **before**]{.mark} major **[decisions and commitments are
made]{.mark}**]{.underline} (IAIA and IEA, 1999). Often described as [an
environmental protection tool]{.underline}, a [methodology,
and]{.underline} [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[regulatory
requirement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [EA is most importantly a process
designed [to **aid decision making**]{.mark},]{.underline} [through
which concerns about the potential [environmental consequences]{.mark}
of proposed actions, public or private, [are **incorporated into
decisions**]{.mark} regarding those actions]{.underline}. In this
regard, [EA can]{.underline} also be viewed as a means of
[strengthen]{.underline}ing [environmental management
processes]{.underline} (Morrison-Saunders and Bailey, 1999).
[The]{.underline} underlying [intent of EA is to enable proponents,
communities, and decision makers [to **increase**]{.mark} **the
[benefits]{.mark}** [and **minimize**]{.mark} the **[environmental costs
of development]{.mark}** actions]{.underline}. In this sense,
[[EA]{.mark} is both a planning tool and a management tool for choosing
and **designing** developments wisely]{.underline}. [It can also
be]{.underline} viewed in a **[much broader]{.underline}** context: as
**[a [means to influence decisions and]{.mark} to [provide]{.mark} [an
opportunity for public debate about the merits of a proposed
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[There is a significant body of literature that examines public
participation in EIA canvasing a variety of aspects,]{.underline}
including objectives, methods, and program design characteristics, among
others. **[This [literature has been]{.mark} increasingly [calling for
more meaningful participation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, that is
participation [that]{.underline} "... establishes the needs, values, and
concerns of the public, **[[provides a genuine opportunity to influence
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and uses multiple and customized
methods of engagement that promote and sustain fair and open two-way
dialogue" (Sinclair et al., 2022, p. 242; Sinclair & Doelle, 2018).
[Among the desirable components of 'meaningfulness' that are recurrently
highlighted by EIA scholars are]{.underline} the following: •
**[[Involve]{.mark}ment of [the public early]{.mark} in process [so
participants can]{.mark} shape the discussions and have an
[impact]{.mark} on [decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Doelle, 2018),
**[[including participation in decision-making over]{.mark} strategic
[development plans]{.mark} and programs]{.underline}** (Rega &
Baldizzone, 2015); • Adequate notice and sufficient time to prepare an
informed submission (Doelle, 2018; Sinclair & Diduck, 2016; Stewart &
Sinclair, 2007); • Participant assistance (Doelle, 2018; Stewart &
Sinclair, 2007), including funding and capacity-building; • Modes of
participation which promote two-way dialogue (Stewart & Sinclair, 2007),
which can allow for learning (Doelle, 2018; Stewart & Sinclair, 2007); •
Access to information to ensure transparency throughout the project life
cycle (Sinclair & Diduck, 2016); • [[Implement]{.mark}ing the principles
of natural justice]{.underline} (Doelle, 2018), [including]{.underline}
access to process, through hearing requirements, written and oral
comments, and **[[the right to challenge
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Woods, 2009); and • Reporting back on
how public comments are addressed, through tools such as an
issuestracking table. The interplay amongst these elements necessitates
careful consideration of each component, as well as how these components
fit in the overall plan. When designing, discussing, or evaluating
participatory EIA systems, it is important to understand several issues.

[At [the center]{.mark} of any engagement project is the [question
of]{.mark} empowerment]{.underline} -- **[specifically [how much control
is afforded to the]{.mark} interested [public in]{.mark} the
[decision-making]{.mark} process]{.underline}**. One of the earliest
works in this area was carried out by Arnstein (1969), who
conceptualized the famous 8-rung ladder of citizen participation, as
discussed in introduction of this handbook (Buhmann et al., 2024). [The
International Association of Public Participation]{.underline} (IAP2,
2023) [later reduced the levels of empowerment to five: inform, consult,
involve, collaborate, and empower]{.underline}.
**[[Scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** often **[[call for]{.mark} the
[empowerment of the public(s) in decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
goal is aligned with [ensuring that [state decisions]{.mark} better
consider both economic interests (]{.underline}as represented by
corporations) [and public interests]{.underline} (as represented by
public(s)) [in the decision]{.underline}. [In practice, however,
engagement opportunities, particularly those identified in legislation,
better [lend themselves to **tokenism**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
**[[informing the public about the project, and providing]{.mark} some
[entryways into sharing information with the
decision-maker]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This [mismatch between]{.mark}
individual [expectations and]{.mark} design [limitations can lead to
disillusionment]{.mark} and disenfranchisement by participations,
[who]{.mark} come to **[see project approval as a 'foregone
conclusion']{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Diduck & Sinclair, 2002;
Diduck et al., 2002).

Second, [[early relationship building is a pre-requisite to meaningful
and efficient participation]{.underline}]{.mark} ([Tuck et al.,
2005](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0195925515300536?via=ihub#bb0495)),

However, our research suggests that this is a commonly understood
principle, but it remains an opportunity that many government agencies
and proponents either do not take advantage of or are unable to realize
due to other, underlying challenges -- including the lack of clarity
about their respective responsibilities regarding participation and

[The benefits of having [a]{.mark} [legislated and **mandatory** basis
for EA]{.mark} are well established]{.underline} in the Canadian
literature ([Gibson,
1993](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0195925505001162?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=93fb56246e81e1db#bib9), [Jeffery,

[Such a foundation reduces the risk of decisions being influenced by
inappropriate considerations, **[enhances]{.mark}** procedural
**[certainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[clarifies authority, creates
clear rights and responsibilities]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and]{.mark}
presents opportunities for [judicial remedies to encourage proper
application]{.mark} of the legislation]{.underline}. [In
some]{.underline} other [aspects of EA]{.underline} in Canada,
[mandatory legislative language has already been adopted.]{.underline}
[Examples include the provisions]{.underline} in CEAA [that determine
whether an EA is required for a project, and the requirement for
comprehensive studies for specific larger projects]{.underline}.

In other respects, **[however, high levels of [discretion]{.mark}
remain]{.underline}**, [[leadi]{.mark}ng [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[uncertainty]{.mark} about the process and inconsistent
application]{.underline}**. In particular, [high levels of
discretion]{.underline} and critical legislative gaps [characterize EA
public involvement]{.underline} regimes in Canada ([Sinclair and Doelle,
2003](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0195925505001162?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=93fb56246e81e1db#bib24)).
Government EA officials have argued that [discretion]{.underline} is
necessary to allow [for flexibility]{.underline} [in tailoring public
involvement]{.underline} to the multitude of situations created by
different EA cases. The opposite view is that [with too many
discretionary provisions, the law provides little in the way of
direction for achieving meaningful public participation]{.underline}. We
have argued in this paper that this **[debate over [discretion versus
certainty is misplaced and misses the central flaw in]{.mark} current
[EA]{.mark} legislation dealing with the [role of the
public]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That flaw is the failure to focus on the
outcome.

This article therefore advocates a rethinking of the legal underpinnings
of public participation in Canadian EA legislation and suggests that
[changes are necessary to [create a **clear and mandatory foundation for
public involvement**]{.mark} [that enables]{.mark} more meaningful
participation and allows [decision-making]{.mark} aimed at
sustainability [to]{.mark} occur]{.underline}. To achieve this,
legislative [reforms]{.underline} [are needed that would [see the public
**engaged early in the decision process**]{.mark}]{.underline} through
techniques that prove effective at [achieving consensus]{.underline},
with the process being overseen by reengaged RAs who would evaluate
participatory outcomes and call a panel review if necessary.

It is very likely that [[some]{.mark} will initially [feel]{.mark} that
collaboration resulting in a [consensus]{.mark} outcome [is
unworkable]{.mark}. Such a stance is [the result of decades of negative
experience with adversarial EA]{.mark} processes that ended in negative
outcomes]{.underline}. [The approach advocated here has the potential to
create the conditions for more positive outcomes]{.underline}.
**[[As]{.mark} some [positive experiences unfold, the nature of EA will
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[The need for]{.underline}**]{.mark}
economic **[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** in many regions of
Canada **[and the desire for change and improved health and well-being
[will]{.mark} help to [motivate]{.mark} collaboration and
consensus]{.underline}**. If anything, a consensus-based process
involving only the current generation of Canadians still errs on the
side of allowing economic development that is not sustainable. It is
therefore in many ways still only a small step forward. It does,
however, get us closer to balancing conflicting short-term interests.
Anything beyond this depends on [[providing a forum for collaborative
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[may lead to]{.mark} the
[true]{.mark} integration envisaged in the concept of [sustainable
development]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The changes recommended will require all parties to rethink their
current roles in EA. Proponents have to choose whether or not they want
to subject their project to a panel review from the start or to address
public concerns through a consensus building process initiated early in
their planning process. The public has to engage in project planning
with proponents and monitor the planning and decision-making processes
to ensure that their concerns have been addressed. The RA must develop
new rules of procedure, as outlined above, and commit in ensuring that
the proponent has met their obligation in terms of public involvement or
call a panel review. Federal and provincial government have to take
their role of ongoing participation and leadership in broader issues of
planning for sustainability more seriously at the community, provincial
and federal level to provide better sustainability criteria against
which to evaluate specific projects and policies.

[[There are obvious benefits to all parties if public participation
occurs early]{.mark} in the planning cycle [and is aimed at]{.mark}
achieving [consensus]{.mark} around the desired outcome of a project
EA]{.underline}. [[The key benefits to the public are]{.mark} that
**[the power balance]{.mark}** between them and the proponent **[is
shifted to encourage proponents to consider public concerns
seriously]{.mark}** and actually address those concerns]{.underline}.
**[[The proponent will benefit in]{.mark} terms of the
[certainty]{.mark} of process, [knowing when the]{.mark} review [process
has ended, improved]{.mark} project [design]{.mark} through meaningful
public participation in the design stages, [and greater project
acceptance]{.mark} in affected communities]{.underline}**. The RA
benefits with improved process and decision satisfaction of all parties
as well as being able to be clearer about the contributions of a project
to stated government goals around sustainability commonplace at all
levels of government. [[Society]{.mark} as a whole [will benefit from
better responses to]{.mark} our pressing [problems, including]{.mark}
better attention to multiple [sustainability]{.mark} purposes, better
selection among possible options [and **better**]{.mark} design and
implementation of the **[projects that are]{.mark}** selected and
**[approved]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The time has come to redesign EA processes to demonstrate]{.underline}
in practice what has been known in theory for some time, [that [the more
openly you engage the public, the earlier you do it, the better you do
it, the better the project, and everyone wins]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
problem with [public participation]{.mark} is that while we know this to
be true in theory, it [will]{.mark} only [translate]{.mark} into
practice [in an atmosphere of cooperation]{.mark} and trust, in an
atmosphere of [power balance and openness to
change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [[even if this process does not
motivate]{.mark} parties to chose]{.underline} the path of
[[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} and early public engagement **[[every
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[it will]{.mark} serve over time to
[illustrate]{.mark} the [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} to those that
chose this path, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} with time [will]{.underline}
serve to [[overcome]{.mark} the barrier of [distrust]{.mark} and
disillusionment [that currently exists]{.mark} with the EA
process]{.underline}.

One of the side benefits of the process is that [communities develop a
more common vision of what a sustainable community might look like,
or]{.underline} what role their communities might play in
[[moving]{.underline}]{.mark} the province, the country, or [[the global
community in]{.mark} the direction of
[sustainability]{.mark}.]{.underline} This recognizes the reality that
there is no one right path to [sustainability]{.underline} that can or
should be scientifically determined, but that the path [is defined
through the collective decisions of all involved, and the more we each
understand about the path and our role, the better the chance that our
collective decisions will actually move us in the direction of
sustainability]{.underline}.

### 2NC\-\--AT: PDCP

#### Counterplan isn't the aff, textually or functionally. Perm severs, that's a voter. No-cost perms skew neg ground, moots the block, and rewards bad debating. 

#### 1\-\--TEXTUALLY\-\--CP replaces the verb \[x\] with \[y\] gerund. It's a different word and is a different part of speech because we are assessing the noun, not fiating the verb. 

#### 2\-\--FUNCTIONALLY\-\--CP includes the option to [not]{.underline} do the aff. Any perm either links or severs the requirement to do the plan. Affs must be immediately certain\-\--

#### a\-\--Should means an [immediate]{.underline} and [durable legal obligation]{.underline}. It's how the courts will interpret the plan.

Performance v. Ishee, 627 So. 2d 283 //pipk

At this time, there are no Mississippi cases which construe Canon 7A(3).
However, other [[courts]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
[interpret]{.mark}ed]{.underline} Canon 7A(3) or
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[provision to
**require**]{.underline}]{.mark} a judge to resign
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} he or she becomes a candidate for a
non-judicial office. See, e.g., Morial v. Judiciary Commission of
**[Louisiana]{.underline}**, 565 F.2d 295, 299-303 (5th Cir. 1977) (Fay,
J., dissenting); \[\*\*9\] Adams v. Supreme Court of
**[Pennsylvania]{.underline}**, 502 F. Supp. 1282, 1292 (M.D.Pa. 1980)
(rule 15(E) of the Governing Standards of Conduct for District Justices
requiring a district judge to resign his office when he becomes a
candidate upheld); Committee for an Effective Judiciary v. State, 209
**[Mont]{.underline}**. 105, 679 P.2d 1223 (Mont. 1984); In re Inquiry
Concerning a Judge No. 591, 250 **[Ga]{.underline}**. 796, 300 S.E.2d
807 (Ga. 1983). **[This]{.underline}** \"resign-to-run\" **[requirement
has been upheld as reasonable]{.underline}**, and there are judges in
other jurisdictions who have been sanctioned in one form or another for
violation of the requirement. See, e.g., Feltz v. Crabtree, 370 S.E.2d
619 (W.Va. 1988).

[Ishee contends]{.underline} that [[the language]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Canon 7A(3) **[is not mandatory because it [says
\"should]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" **[rather than \"the mandatory
terminology of \'shall]{.underline}**.\'\" [Ishee cites [no authority
for]{.mark} his [distinction between \"shall\" and
\"should.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} American Heritage [Dictionary]{.mark} of the English
Language]{.underline} (1981) [[defines]{.mark} \"[should\"
as:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[the past tense of shall]{.underline}, **[but]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[more often]{.mark} used as [an auxiliary verb expressing]{.mark}
degrees of the [present and future]{.mark}]{.underline}** and various
shades \[\*\*10\] **[of attendant meaning indicating: 1. [obligation;
duty; necessity]{.mark}]{.underline}**....

Id. at 1199. [The fact [that \"should\" is the past tense of \"shall\"
means]{.mark} that [the two]{.mark} words [are]{.mark} basically **[the
same]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially **[[with regard to]{.mark} their
\"[mandatory]{.mark}\" nature]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[[the first
listed definition of \"should\" states that]{.mark} the word [connotes a
requirement, not an option]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ishee fails to
convince us **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Canon]{.underline} 7A(3)
**[[does]{.underline}]{.mark}** not **[[mandate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
resignation by a judge who chooses to stand for election to a
non-judicial office. Ishee also alleges that prior to his receipt of the
letter of June 14, 1991, notifying him of the enforcement of Canon
7A(3), he spoke with a justice court judge, who served as a member of
the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance, and who was also to
become a member of the Committee who heard Ishee\'s case. Ishee alleged
that this Commission member told him that running for the office of
circuit clerk while serving as a justice court judge did not violate
Canon 7A(3).

#### b\-\--The CP is a PIC out of "should \[verb\]". We make the normative desirability of the plan part of the review process. That's key to public participation.

[Another [relevant]{.mark} issue [is the **scope**]{.mark} of
participation, [which refers to the nature of the matter]{.mark} or
subject [under review, from narrow to broad]{.mark} in
nature]{.underline} (Bherer & Breux, 2012; Fung, 2003). Smith (1982)
provides additional guidance, organizing the participation themes among
three categories: 1) **[[Normative]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[the
broadest scope]{.mark}, [address]{.mark}ing societal values and
[premises]{.mark} which inform a range of decision
themes]{.underline}**. **[[For example, should a country
allow]{.underline}]{.mark}** uranium **[[mining]{.underline}]{.mark}**?
2) [[Strategic]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [the scope that
[considers]{.mark} the range of [alternative means of achieving the
normative direction]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, are new mining
pits an appropriate means of contributing to the diamond industry or are
there alternative technologies available? 3)
[[Operational]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [a scope [involving a specific,
narrow application]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, should this
diamond mine be permitted to operate as proposed? **[[It is important to
ensure]{.mark} that [the public has]{.mark} an opportunity to provide
[input into normative]{.mark}]{.underline}** and strategic **[[issues
which inform operational exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This can be
done outside project-level decision-making, for example, by involving
the public in previous strategic and regional environmental
assessments]{.underline} (Rega & Baldizzone, 2015).

#### c\-\--immediate certainty is key to ground. The topic is omnidirectional with no real limit beyond being a legal requirement to commit some action in relation to the Arctic. Otherwise, kick the CP and vote neg on presumption because if the aff isn't required to happen, inherency means it won't.

### 2NC\-\--AT: Certainty Key

#### \*[note]{.mark}. Same as card on the PDCP block. If for some reason you're not reading it there, it's here, but otherwise can just cross-apply this card. 

#### Prior and binding EIS is key to certainty. The perm creates confusion and causes a public backlash that is perceived as less certain.

[[This paper]{.mark} explores the underlying [practice-based challenges

in [environmental
assessment](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/environmental-assessment)]{.underline} ([[EA]{.underline}]{.mark}) -
[[participation]{.mark} that provides meaningful opportunities
[for]{.mark} Aboriginal [communities to shape EA, yet assures]{.mark} a
degree of efficiency for project proponents who need to obtain EA
approvals in [a timely and financially viable
manner]{.mark}]{.underline}. We do so based on an analysis of the EA
policy community\'s experience with uranium exploration and mining in
Saskatchewan, Canada. [Many of the challenges to meaningful and
efficient Aboriginal participation that emerged are multi-dimensional,
often concerning participation processes, decision-making, and
relationships]{.underline}. [Although [scholars have]{.mark} explored
many of these issues and have proposed numerous
[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[challenges persist in
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Several other
[[issues]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[emerged]{.underline}]{.mark} from
our study that have received limited attention, [[including]{.mark} the
[non-commitment to]{.mark} early and **[ongoing participation]{.mark}**
by smaller project proponents, [and]{.mark} **the [EA exemption of

land use in EA not aligning with the information that is available to
proponents; confusion about who is responsible for initiating early
participation and consultation processes; the lack of early relationship
building with potentially affected communities, particularly by
governments; and the lack of other viable avenues, outside EA, for
Aboriginal communities to raise more strategic issues of concern that
affect traditional lands and treaty rights]{.underline}.

The non-commitment to participation by some developers, especially for
small projects or exploration activities, was identified by eight
participants, mostly Aboriginal and industry participants, but also an
EA practitioner, as a significant challenge to meaningful participation.
Participants indicated that communities want to be engaged early in
development planning for *any* project with the potential to affect
traditional lands and livelihoods -- regardless of its size or
permanency, or the size of the development company. The failure to
engage communities for small projects, or by proponents with no
long-term investment in the area, was raised by Aboriginal participants
as damaging to their relationship with industry -- even with those
larger companies with long-term investments. This is not to say that all
small project proponents falter on Aboriginal participation; rather, as
several industry participants explained, since small-scale exploration
projects often don\'t require EA, Aboriginal participation seldom
happens; there is no formal requirement for participation.

When we raised this concern, one of the government officials emphasized
that "the Crown and proponent are still required to engage with relevant
communities" even for small projects. However, several Aboriginal
community participants, referring to current uranium exploration near La
Loche, indicated: "not all exploration industries drilling in our
backyard have adequately consulted us on the reserves, but spoken to
only our elected leaders." A community leader from La Loche commented
that Aboriginal people in La Loche are not opposed to development, but
that *all* potential project proponents need to initiate early
discussions with the broader community, not only community leaders,
before seeking the issuance of exploration permits, regardless of the
scale or duration of development.

[Our analysis is based on current EA systems and practices
in]{.underline} northwest Saskatchewan, [Canada]{.underline} -- home to
the world\'s highest-grade uranium mining operations, and a region with
significant oil sands development potential. [Though our research is set
within the Canadian context, the observations and lessons that emerge
are applicable to understanding, and hopefully addressing, some of the
underlying practice-based challenges to meaningful and efficient
indigenous participation in EA **in other** resource **development

brief discussion of the nature and role of Aboriginal participation in
the Canadian EA system. This is followed by a description of our study
area and research methods. Results are then presented, focused on what
study participants identified as the main challenges to meaningful and
efficient Aboriginal participation in EA, followed by a discussion of
the implications of these for future EA participation practices.

Despite the extensive scope of research on EA in the Arctic, [we found
only limited research that addressed community and stakeholder
expectations about EA.]{.underline} [**[E]{.mark}**nvironmental
**[a]{.mark}**ssessment [has come under much criticism]{.mark} in recent
years, and a good portion of this negative commentary has [centered
on]{.mark} the role of EA in addressing community and social
[expectations]{.mark} and needs.]{.underline} However, Fuggle (2005)
warns that **[[EA is not a "magic bullet" that can resolve all]{.mark}
environmental and socio-economic [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Part of
the challenge to understanding the efficacy of EA is that **[the
underlying purpose of EA is still much debated]{.underline}**. Cashmore
(2004) argues that [[EA]{.mark} can be perceived as a series of
[nebulous models]{.mark}, operating [along a broad spectrum]{.mark} of
philosophies and values concerning the role of science in
EA.]{.underline} [[At one end]{.mark} of this spectrum [is]{.mark} the
belief that the [scientific]{.mark} method provides the basis for EA
theory and practice; at [the other]{.mark} end [is]{.mark} the belief
that EA is a [civic]{.mark} science designed to empower communities,
promote social justice, and help realize community
self-[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bond et al., 2014).

On the basis of the Swedish experience, HildingRydevik (2006:25) argues
that [what constitutes "[effective" EA can be "\...viewed from]{.mark}
the various and [differing perspectives]{.mark} of the many actor groups
that are a part of the EA system and its processes---legislators,
proponents, competent authorities, NGOs, etc."]{.underline} [[Different
actors have different roles]{.mark} in [and aspirations for EA]{.mark}
in the Arctic, and they may view effective EA according to their role in
and influence on the decisions that emerge]{.underline}. Kaltenborn
(1998) argues that [EA processes often do not consider the importance of
local context.]{.underline} Sasvari (2012), for example, reporting on
recent EA experiences of Saami reindeer-herding communities in northern
Sweden and their interactions with developers, concludes that [policies
continue to conflict with]{.underline} Saami [perceptions and
knowledge]{.underline}. In reviewing the EA process for the BHP diamond
mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, [O'Reilly]{.underline} (1996)
and CARC (1996) [argued that the process was neither rigorous, nor
comprehensive, nor fair; whereas]{.underline} Kwiatkowski and
[Ooi]{.underline} (2003) [characterized the EA as an example of
integrated assessment that considered social, cultural, health, and
environmental impacts and resulted in a project that coordinated the
concerns of all stakeholders in support of sustainable
development]{.underline}.

In reviews of [EA in the western Arctic]{.underline} offshore energy
sector, Ketilson (2011) and Noble et al. (2013) [identified a range of
expectations about EA,]{.underline} specifically strategic EA,
[and]{.underline} [report a diversity of views about what EA can and
should deliver in the western Arctic, and to whom]{.underline}.
Similarly, in [Greenland's]{.underline} offshore oil sector, Olsen and
Hansen (2014) [report a diversity of expectations concerning what EA
should deliver versus what it can deliver regarding effective
participation]{.underline}. The authors report that the **[varying
interests of [stakeholders create different expectations, and
these]{.mark} diverse expectations [are not]{.mark} always
[fulfilled]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Olsen and Hansen (2014) explain that
[industry often approaches EA, particularly through public engagement,
as a means to manage expectations and achieve a social license to
operate]{.underline}; [[enviro]{.mark}nmental
[org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark} [view the process as a means to
influence decisions]{.mark}; while **[local communities]{.mark} [view
the process as a means to understand a project, prepare for]{.mark} its
[impacts, and better capture]{.mark} potential economic
[opportunities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both the requirements for and the
practice of EA vary considerably across the Arctic jurisdictions, but
there has been limited effort amongst the EA research community to fully
understand the diversity of community and stakeholder expectations about
EA.

The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP, 2007) recommended
that [EA]{.underline} and related planning tools be "rigorously applied"
in the Arctic, but also emphasized that such [[tools must be
"streamlined to increase]{.mark} their [relevance and
usefulness]{.mark}]{.underline}" (AMAP, 2007:viii). [Recent literature
on EA effectiveness has tended to focus on making the process less
cumbersome and more efficient]{.underline} (Morgan, 2012; Bond et al.,
2014). [Evaluations of Arctic EA have largely reflected the perspective
of industry or regulators and focused almost exclusively on process or
regulatory efficiency]{.underline} (e.g., Harrison, 2006; McCrank, 2008;
Voutier et al., 2008). In Russia, for example, von Ritter and Tsirkunov
(2003) report that [[EA is]{.mark} often [viewed by project proponents
as an extra burden in]{.mark} the [development]{.mark} and licensing
process offering limited added value for their project.]{.underline}
This view is hardly limited to Russia. In Canada's Arctic, Voutier et
al. (2008:105) have suggested that **[[EA is becoming increasingly
complex and]{.mark} that [the "regulatory regime will undermine the
attractiveness" of the Arctic to industry
investors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More recently, in Iceland, a 2014
[OECD performance review describes [the EA process]{.mark} as [complex
and slow]{.mark} and [recommends]{.mark}, as a step towards "green
growth,"]{.underline} further **[[streamlining]{.mark} of the
[EA]{.mark} process [to reduce admin]{.mark}istrative [costs and
delay]{.mark}]{.underline}** (OECD, 2014). Much less attention has been
given to Arctic community views of the EA process, including its
complexity and responsiveness to concerns about development in a rapidly
changing Arctic environment, or to whether expediting an EA process to
accommodate a proponent's needs and regulatory efficiencies necessarily
compromises the effectiveness of that process.

#### b\-\--that also turns the net benefit

[The increasing recognition of the need for EAs in the Arctic to
recognize and integrate traditional knowledge has increased the
expectations for industry to ensure **early and ongoing** community
**engagement**]{.underline} (Saarikoski, 2000; Armitage, 2005; Meschtyb
et al., 2005; Fitzpatrick et al., 2008). In his analysis of the Sierilä
hydropower station in northern Finland, for example, Huttunen (1999:34)
reported that [community engagement in the EA process increased mutual
learning and understanding, as well the degree of interactive planning,
resulting in "a significant awakening to their own empowerment and
self-management" among community members]{.underline}. At the same time,
Huttunen cautioned that **[communities often lack the capacity to
participate effectively in the EA process]{.underline}**. [Capacity
concerns were similarly raised by stakeholders]{.underline} at the 2011
Alaska Forum on the Environment, [reporting]{.underline} to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency [the need for Arctic communities not
only to see the benefits of their engagement in EA, but]{.underline}
also to be provided with **[the resources]{.underline}** needed **[to
ensure meaningful engagement]{.underline}** (IWG, 2011).

[Growing requirements for and expectations of consultation with Arctic
communities **before, during, and after** the EA process, combined with
increasing numbers of EA applications for Arctic development, are
raising concerns about the **capacity of Arctic communities to become
meaningfully engaged in EA processes**]{.underline}. In their review of
marine planning, assessment, and science programs in Canada's western
Arctic, for example, Fidler and Noble (2013a) identified [local capacity
and resources]{.underline} as [constrain]{.underline}ts on [meaningful
participation in the EA process]{.underline}. The report of the
Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board's 2008 EIA
Practitioners' Workshop (MVEIRB, 2008) similarly identified the lack of
capacity as an ongoing concern in Arctic EA, noting specifically
[community concerns about the constant struggle to retain their capacity
to participate in EA and the **increasing workload of Aboriginal groups
to coordinate EAs** with land users, elders, and their chief and
council]{.underline}. McCrank (2008) also identified [limited
institutional and human resource capacity of Aboriginal
organizations]{.underline} as potentially [hinder]{.underline}ing [their
ability to participate in the EA process and to document and interpret
traditional knowledge to assist in decision making]{.underline}.

Regardless of advancements, not all regions provide an opportunity for
engagement in EA processes. In Russia, for example, public participation
varies across regions depending on the openness of the respective
regional authorities. A 2006 OECD review of environmental policy and
regulation in Russia described the EA system as technocratic, focused on
verifying project compliance with existing laws and regulations, with
limited opportunity for public participation until the very late stages
of the process, when participation is best described as non-government
organization activism as opposed to meaningful engagement (OECD, 2006).
In Canada, the National Energy Board has implemented an onerous process
of approving who is allowed to participate in hearing processes,
restricting issues to be addressed and discussed during its
deliberations.

[Given the enduring concerns over engagement in EA, combined with the
anticipated growth in EA applications for Arctic development, there is a
need to examine how to facilitate capacity building in Arctic
communities that will permit meaningful engagement in EA, as well as the
institutional or process reforms necessary to ensure that such
engagement occurs]{.underline}.

[[Not all issues can be]{.mark} appropriately assessed, understood, or
managed at the scale of [project-based EA.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Increasingly, [scholars, communities, and environmental organizations
are [lobby]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} more [regional]{.mark} and strategic
approaches to [EA in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cherp and
Golubeva, 2004; WWF, 2005; Voutier et al., 2008; Doelle et al., 2012;
Fidler and Noble, 2012; Noble et al., 2013). Specifically, [there is a
recognized need for EA [to]{.mark} be more proactive in its approach to
[plan]{.mark}ning [for]{.mark} future [development]{.mark} and to better
assess cumulative environmental effects, including climate-change and
transboundary effects. The challenge, however, is that although many
planning, science, and assessment programs are ongoing in the Arctic, it
remains uclear how these programs contribute to better EA, and vice
versa]{.underline}.

In the Canadian Arctic, for example, regional initiatives such as the
Integrated Oceans Management Plan (IOMP), the Beaufort Regional
Environmental Assessment (BREA), the Integrated Regional Impact Studies
(IRIS), the Cumulative Impact Monitoring Program (CIMP), and various
land-use plans address issues that may be relevant to EA; however, the
challenge is to determine how the processes and data and knowledge
generated are best translated and used to inform and influence
regulatory EA processes and decisions (Fidler and Noble, 2013a). There
is also an assumption that these processes, and the data and information
generated, are useful to EA decisions. Concerning CIMP, for example, the
MVEIRB (2005:7) reports: "...it is unclear to the MVEIRB what
information is being collected through CIMP...and how this information
can be used in the EA process."

This relationship between regional and strategic initiatives and EA,
described in the EA literature (João, 2005; Fischer, 2006) as
"[[tiering]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[assumes]{.mark} that
[regional]{.mark} or higherlevel [initiatives]{.mark} (e.g., planning
processes, regional studies, and monitoring programs]{.underline}) are
intended to [influence or **[provide]{.mark} strategic
[direction]{.mark} to project-based EA.**]{.underline} Lessons reported
from [the Norwegian experience]{.underline} in the Barents Sea have
[show]{.underline}n some indicators of [successful tiering]{.underline}
(see Fidler and Noble, 2012). In 2006, **[the Norwegian parliament
introduced its]{.underline}** Integrated Management
**[Plan]{.underline}**, a process designed [to capture all sectors in
the offshore environment]{.underline}, [assess total impact, and
identify knowledge gaps and conflict areas so as to provide an overview
[of **where and under what conditions**]{.mark} offshore **[activity
should occur]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although [the]{.underline}
Integrated Management Plan [provides an opportunity for project
proponents to demonstrate compliance with higher-level planning goals
and priorities]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Barents Sea Integrated
Management [Plan is [not tiered toward individual]{.mark}]{.underline}
energy field [[developments]{.underline} **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[is [not necessary for the approval of new
developments]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### 9\-\--Perm do the plan through the CP process. \[The United States federal government should engage in a prior and binding Environmental Impact Assessment based on international guidelines for the Arctic ~~on~~ \[significantly increasing its development of the Arctic\].

\*Note for this perm. I'm just using the resolution as an example,
you'll have to write out the actual text based on your plan. My CP text
template is written to replace the verb with the gerund form, i.e.
increase -\> increasing, expand -\> expanding. If they've written their
CP text to say something like "on whether to significantly increase its
development of the Arctic", then the perm text should omit the words "on
whether", to then just say "guidelines for the Arctic to significantly
increase its development of the Arctic."

### 1AR\-\--Non-Binding Perm

#### Non-binding perm solves. It doesn't give veto power over the mandate of the plan but gives input into how the plan will be implemented. Doesn't sever the aff, veto isn't key to governance, and they can't solve the net benefit because EIS isn't a magic bullet. No deficit to the perm because the only people that expect veto power are environmental groups that want to use the power to veto. Local communities are what their ev says is key to cooperative governance and they don't expect EIS to be [binding]{.underline}. That's Noble 15.

Finally, [[participatory processes work better when those involved have
a clear understanding of]{.mark} their roles and of the **[limits of the
process]{.mark}** they are engaged in]{.underline} ([Krupta et al.,
2015](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0195925515300536?via=ihub#bb0260), [Sinclair

A common concern raised by industry participants is that [local
Aboriginal [communities]{.mark} often enter EA [with an expectation to
address broader policy]{.mark} or land claimed-based
issues]{.underline}. This is not surprising, since [Aboriginal
communities often approach EA as part of a larger political processes
concerning resource development and [desire to place much larger issues
on the table than a single project]{.mark}]{.underline} ([Booth and
Skelton,
2011b](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0195925515300536?via=ihub#bb0045)).
[Aboriginal communities understandably "expect that potential impacts to
their recognized rights be adequately considered during the project
review process, but many of the [issues raised are not 'EA]{.mark}
issues' per se; rather, [they are]{.mark} much [larger policy, legal
and]{.mark} even [constitutionally based issues]{.mark} concerning land

Saskatchewan, and the issues raised continue to be the source of much
inefficiency and misunderstanding during the EA process.

#### c\-\--PRESUMPTION FLIPS AFF\-\--there's no basis for a deficit because there's no real evidence to support any claims about what an EIS best practice is. Any risk of case outweighs even a 100% risk of the net benefit because probability of being able to solve it is zero.

[[To address]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[concerns]{.mark} and improve
EA performance, scholars and practitioners have **[proposed various best
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Senecal et al. 
[1999](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);
Wood 
[2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);
Gibson et al. 
[2005](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);
Vanclay et al. 
[2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811)).
While these efforts have considerably advanced EA knowledge and
practice, [there remain [deficiencies in]{.mark} the [best practices
literature]{.mark} that [need to be addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}.
First, [[there are key EA design issues]{.mark}, such as the appropriate
structure of EA appeal processes]{.underline}, that are not sufficiently
canvassed in the existing literature. Second, much of the existing
**[[literature is based]{.mark} mainly up[on]{.mark} [author]{.mark}
observation and [inference without a clear explanation of how the
practices were derived and without sufficient evidence supporting the
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The principles published by the
International Association of Impact Assessment (IAIA) (Senecal et al. 
[1999](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);
Vanclay 
[2003](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);

[2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);
Vanclay et al. 
[2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811))
are notable exceptions in that there is a description of how the
practices were formulated and validated by soliciting input from EA
experts, but the IAIA [[publications do not provide]{.mark} a
[transparent summary of]{.mark} the [input]{.mark} received and how it
was used]{.underline}. Third, the [best practice [literature does
not]{.mark} adequately [address contextual factors]{.mark} that may
influence when and how the proposed practices should be applied in
specific settings]{.underline}. Fourth, **[[best practice
recommendations are based]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} the [EA literature
and could be better informed by]{.mark} relevant literature in [related
fields]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Fifth, **[[best practice recommendations
have not been sufficiently tested to verify links between processes and
desired outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Establishing causal
connections between practices and substantive outcomes is
an]{.mark}]{.underline} important **[[aspiration]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of research on EA effectiveness (Sadler 
[1996](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14615517.2015.1063811);

#### The perm is legitimate\-\--

#### a\-\--perms don't have to be immediate\-\--even if the plan does, the perm can add sequences from the CP. Certainty is sufficient for neg ground. Key to beating delay a month CPs.

#### b\-\--this perm is immediate\-\--sequential steps don't sever immediacy because an aff can't immediately fiat development, just that the process starts. The perm adds a step to the normal means process but the initial step includes the requirement for the plan. Their interp would lead to uneductional and overpowered neg ground based on aff fiating through normal means regulations and procedures. 

### 1AR\-\--EIS Fails

#### CP can't solve

Deep empowerment of the public in EIA is complicated. Even if
policymakers had the political will to aim higher in terms of meaningful
participation, they would face several knowledge barriers. How does one
determine the appropriate level of engagement required for a project?
Some would argue it is size (i.e., budget), but [small projects can have
significant impacts on the community]{.underline}. Some would argue that
the decision should be governed based on expressed interest, but that
would require that both the proponent and the government do a good job
at notifying stakeholders and citizens about the proposal. [Some would
argue that engagement be limited,]{.underline} except in cases of
basin-opening projects (e.g., projects with a novella component
including use of new technology, or in new regions). **[But that negates
the importance of learning that underpins more effective impact
assessment processes.]{.underline}**

In addition to that, [projects may have a wide range of groups of
affected people, some who are adversely affected, some who are
positively affected]{.underline}. **[How does one judge acceptability of
trade-offs between different groups of affected people]{.underline}**?
[Another example of persistent challenge is related to the subjectivity
and uncertainty of impacts, particularly the social ones]{.underline}.
[Proponents and government tend to be ill-equipped for organizing and
understanding qualitative data -- which is typically contributed by the
public]{.underline}. Current [consultation practices]{.underline} can
mitigate uncertainty, [but]{.underline} can also [distort realities and
pressure for hidden agendas]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--Non-Prior Perm

#### This perm solves. Does the plan and binding EIS as the plan is happening. Binding EIS means the plan will be implemented according to local input. It's not intrinsic or the CP can't solve. If the CP is only a one-off yes/no on the aff, then it's wildly insufficient. All their ev says it needs to be ongoing, allowed to duige implementation, and require compliance with remediation measures. All of those solve. Prior alone is insufficient, needs to be ongoing. CP ends the EIS.

### 1AR\-\--Overstretch Turn

#### Perm builds up capabilities.

[[Two major difficulties faced by Indigenous communities are presented
by]{.mark} the very [size and complexity of the]{.mark}
[e]{.mark}nvironmental [i]{.mark}mpact [a]{.mark}ssessments carried
out]{.underline} (reports of hundreds to thousands of pages are the
norm) and the complexity of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
[[Communities]{.mark} that have had a history of paternalistic relations
with governments [are]{.mark} often **[not ready to become a stakeholder
in decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sassoon, 1998). [Many
[Indigenous communities identify local]{.mark} environmental
[concerns]{.mark} about a proposed development project in their area,
[but do not know where to obtain baseline information]{.mark} or
knowledge regarding the environmental health outcomes associated with
the development project. [This]{.mark} significantly [limits]{.mark} the
[community's capabilities to evaluate]{.mark} the [risks]{.mark} they
might face if the project, program or policy proceeds]{.underline}.

[[There are many]{.underline}]{.mark} other [major [hurdles
facing]{.mark}]{.underline} these [potentially impacted
[communities]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} that [most are not familiar
with EIA procedures]{.mark} and protocols, [nor with]{.mark} what
[environmental]{.mark} health [data]{.mark} already exists or how to
access it; nor how to integrate western-based scientific data which
exists within industrial, territorial, provincial or federal data bases
with local Traditional Knowledge (gathered at the community level over
hundreds or thousands of years and adapted to local cultures and
environments).]{.underline} In the past year, two workshops dealing with
the issue of integrating Indigenous knowledge into impact assessment
have been held in Canada: 1. Aboriginal Consultation in EA, 2007;5 and
2. Cultural Impact Assessment: Beyond the Biophysical, 2008.6
