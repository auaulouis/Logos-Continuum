# Coast Guard

### 1NC Coast Guard Fails

#### The Coast Guard is ineffective and is cutting their logistics now because of DOGE.

**Maritime Executive 25** (Editorial Board of The Maritime Executive,
04/08/2025, "U.S. Coast Guard Cancels New Logistics IT System to Save
Money,"
https://maritime-executive.com/article/u-s-coast-guard-cancels-new-logistics-it-system-to-save-money,
The Maritime Executive, accessed 7/23/25.) // KG

The U.S. Coast Guard is set to save \$32.7 million following the
termination of an information technology program that was once deemed
critical in "integrating capabilities," but which is now said to
be ineffective.

**[[In]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [move]{.mark}]{.underline}** instigated
**[by]{.underline}** the Department of Government Efficiency
(**[[DOGE]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and in line with the Coast Guard's
Force Design 2028 (FD 2028) initiative, the agency announced **[the
[terminat]{.mark}ion of th[e]{.mark} [Logistics Information Management
System]{.mark}]{.underline}** (CG-LIMS), with its program activities
expected to cease no later than May 1, 2025. With the termination of the
"ineffective" program, the agency is expected to save \$32.7 million,
funds that have already been appropriated and which will now be
redirected to address emerging needs.

CG-LIMS was among the nearly 500 IT systems that the Coast Guard has
invested millions to procure to help execute its various missions.
Expected to begin operating in 2027 before reaching full capability in
2031, the CG-LIMS had been marketed as a system that leverages modern
and cloud-based technology to deliver an integrated capability.

In particular, **[the [system would have allowed the agency to better
track its supply needs, ease the logistics burden on field
units,]{.mark} [provide a modern IT tool for maintenance teams and offer
better cybersecurity than current systems. The system was also expected
to support maintenance and supply of aircraft, vessels, and shore based
assets besides managing asset configuration, supply, maintenance and
technical data for capital assets in a single
unit.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The Coast Guard intended to utilize the system on 245 cutters, 200
aircraft, 1,800 boats, shore-based systems, aids to navigation equipment
and command, control, communications, computers, cyber, intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance equipment.

However, with **[DOGE now [determin]{.mark}ing [that the program is
ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} the Coast Guard is expected
to stop any acquisition activities and reassign CG-LIMS personnel to
fill other critical personnel shortages within the agency.

"Another win for government efficiency," said Kristi Noem, Secretary of
Homeland Security. "\$32 million in taxpayer savings thanks to the Coast
Guard eliminating an ineffective IT program. I'm proud of the men and
women of the Coast Guard, who continue to deliver on the President\'s
agenda and deliver efficiency while securing our borders and maritime
approaches."

### 1NC Fisheries Alt Cause

#### Global fisheries are already suffering, and their impact hasn't happened.

Elizabeth **Cerny-Chipman** **23** (Senior Policy Analyst with the Ocean
Conservancy's Fish Conservation Program, 06/29/2025, "Snapshot of U.S.
Fisheries Shows a Need for Change,"
https://oceanconservancy.org/blog/2023/06/29/snapshot-of-u-s-fisheries-shows-a-need-for-change/,
Ocean Conservancy, accessed 7/23/25.) // KG

Each year, NOAA Fisheries reports to Congress about how fish stocks are
doing in the U.S. in the Status of Stocks report. The report focuses on
a few key numbers: namely, overfishing in general, or how many **[[fish
stocks are being fished at an unsustainable rate]{.mark},]{.underline}**
and also how many stocks are overfished, where their population size is
too low to provide long-term sustainable fishing. The report also
provides details on how many stocks have been rebuilt to a healthy
population size after being overfished.

For fisheries policy advocates like me, the report is an invaluable
snapshot of where things stand, and for the last several years[, **[the
news]{.underline}**]{.mark} out of the report [**[has been
concerning.]{.underline}** **[There have been more stocks that are
overfished, no new stocks rebuilt and a plateau on how many stocks are
experiencing overfishing. These trends point to a reversal in
progress]{.underline}**]{.mark} made toward more sustainable fisheries
over the last few decades.

The most [recent
report](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable-fisheries/status-stocks-2022),
released earlier this spring, tells us [that **[the waters are still
murky]{.underline}**]{.mark} for U.S. fisheries. There have been some
improvements, but there are also **[still shortcomings]{.underline}**
and signs that status-quo management is not going to be sufficient given
climate change and other threats.

Bottom of Form

For example, it's good news that NOAA Fisheries declared two new stocks
rebuilt for the first time since 2019. But these two stocks tell two
very different stories. One---yellowtail flounder in the Cape Cod and
the Gulf of Maine---has recovered to healthy levels over time and
reached its target population abundance. The other---winter flounder in
Southern New England and the Mid-Atlantic---was rebuilt not because the
stock size got larger, but because scientists determined that the target
population size should actually be lower than they had previously
thought. Essentially, the bar for success was adjusted to reflect a new
reality for the stock in light of changing environmental conditions and
lower stock productivity. This means that even though winter flounder is
technically rebuilt, the stock is still in poor condition and requires
careful management. This situation with winter flounder is one we should
expect to be repeated more often with climate change, which will make
rebuilding stocks more difficult.

Other trends in the report are similarly mixed, as with the tracking of
overfished stocks where the population size is too low to support
long-term sustainable fishing. **[In 2022, [nearly one in five fish
stocks was overfished, a number that remains]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[too high]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Overfishing can erode the long-term
health of the fishery and lead to an overfished stock that needs
rebuilding. Just 7% of stocks were experiencing overfishing, which means
the majority are being fished sustainably. However,
**[[some]{.underline}]{.mark}** of those **[[fish stocks have been
experiencing overfishing for years]{.underline}]{.mark}**---stocks like
greater amberjack in the Gulf of Mexico, where scientists have
determined that the stock has been experiencing overfishing almost
continuously since 1980. These chronically overfished stocks point to
the need to continue to improve the management system. Fish populations
that are overfished and/or experiencing overfishing are less resilient
to environmental changes and provide fewer benefits to the ecosystem and
to people. That's why it matters more than ever to get it right.

### 1NC\-\--Air Power Resilient

### 1AC\-\--Relations A/C

#### Greenland is hardly the problem with US-EU relations

Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law), Springer Cham,

978-3-031-83349-6

Still, there is an overarching theme in the transatlantic relationship:
[How do Europe and the U.S., broadly speaking, view each
other?]{.underline} How much do they need each other? To what extent
might they even depend on each other? [Richard [Haas]{.mark}, the former
[President of]{.mark} the Council on Foreign [Relations]{.mark} and
Director of policy planning [in the]{.mark} U.S. [D]{.mark}epartment
[o]{.mark}f [S]{.mark}tate, arrived at a sober [conclusion in 2011:
'Europe no longer matters']{.mark}.]{.underline} For Haas, the facts
were straightforward: Europe is no longer the region where the
twenty-first century will be forged. The 'old continent' is increasingly
irrelevant in world affairs and the era when transatlantic relations
dominated U.S. foreign policy has thus come to an end. Others have
expressed similar sentiments in less diplomatic terms. [During the Obama
administration, frustration with European hesitancy over Ukraine's
prodemocracy protests led [Victoria Nuland]{.mark}, then U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State, famously to [exclaim in a leaked phone call]{.mark},
'[Well, f]{.mark}\*\*\* [the EU']{.mark}. So, when [even seasoned
diplomats]{.mark} such as Richard Haas and Victoria Nuland [over a
decade ago had already reached the conclusion that Europe matters less
and less for the U.S., one can only imagine how the incoming Trump 2.0
administration will be looking at Europe]{.mark}. Is Europe a valued
partner or a continent that elicits fondness? Not really, [it is a
rather quaint destination for holidays and not much more]{.mark}. The
truth is that the [gap between the U.S. and Europe has]{.mark} steadily
[grown]{.mark}. [Between 2010 and 2023]{.mark} alone, the cumulative
[growth]{.mark} rate of gross domestic product ([GDP]{.mark}) [reached
34% in the U.S.]{.mark}, compared with [21% in the]{.mark} European
Union ([EU]{.mark}).]{.underline} Over the same period, labour
productivity grew by 22% in the U.S., while the Eurozone managed just
5%. Those are just two indicators, but there are plenty more. [Which are
the [largest global tech companies]{.mark} by market
capitalisation?]{.underline} Here are the names: NVIDIA, Apple,
Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, Meta/ Facebook, Tesla and others. The list
goes on and all are from the U.S. Indeed, [[there is not a single
European company in the]{.mark} top 10---or [top 20]{.mark}. [On
environmental]{.mark} issues too, [the gap]{.mark} between the U.S. and
Europe [will grow]{.mark} considerably during the next Trump presidency.
Because whenever [Donald Trump]{.mark} talks about climate change, he
[calls it 'the big hoax']{.mark}. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),
introduced by President Joe Biden and containing a historic commitment
to build a new clean energy economy, [is]{.mark} in the eyes of Donald
Trump a ['green new scam']{.mark}.]{.underline} [The world can thus
expect, in the words of Rachel Cleetus, the Policy Director at the Union
of Concerned Scientists, 'that [the incoming U.S. administration will
take a wrecking ball to global climate diplomacy']{.mark}. [Leaving the
Paris]{.mark} Climate [Agreement]{.mark} yet again upon taking office
will [only be the first of many steps]{.mark}.]{.underline} Europe, on
the other hand, will most likely continue to push ahead with its own
domestic decarbonisation agenda, trying to lead by example at global
level. Only time will tell whether or not Europe will unite around the
objective of pursuing decarbonisation, while boosting industrial
competitiveness, or whether it will fracture and falter. The coming
years will clearly be a challenge for Europe's climate policy, but of
course it is often said that every crisis can be turned into an
opportunity. [Does this mean that [the transatlantic relationship is
doomed to fade]{.mark}, with Europe and the U.S. inevitably drifting
apart, turning their backs on each other? [The change may not be
quick,]{.mark} but nevertheless **[it is a good starting point from
which to accept the fact that those transatlantic heydays of the 1990s
are over and they are not coming back]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Say no

#### The plan is seen as "pressure" from the US and is rejected by Greenland.

Gregers **Moller '25** \[ Editor in Chief of ScandAsia Publishing Ltd.
and founder of Naturist Association Thailand, 03/26/25, "Greenland and
Denmark reject U.S. visit as global competition for rare earths
intensifies,"https://scandasia.com/greenland-and-denmark-reject-u-s-pressure-over-rare-earths-as-global-competition-intensifies/
\] EK

An [[upcoming]{.mark} top-level [visit by U.S. officials to
Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} --- without formal invitation --- has
[[drawn criticism from both Denmark and Greenland,]{.mark} as [concerns
grow over foreign pressure on the Arctic territory's mineral
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Speaking on Monday 25 March 2025, [[Danish Prime Minister]{.mark} Mette
Frederiksen [said]{.mark} the announced [visit]{.mark} [constituted
"unacceptable pressure" from the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, which is seeking greater access to
Greenland's reserves of rare earth elements. The minerals are critical
for use in clean energy, electronics, and defence technologies.

["[Greenland is not for]{.mark} sale --- nor is it for
[pressure]{.mark}," Frederiksen said]{.underline}, according to Reuters.

Greenland's own elected leadership expressed similar concerns.
[According to the island's foreign minister]{.underline}, Vittus
Qujaukitsoq, the U.S. [visit]{.underline} is going to take place without
appropriate coordination and [[was seen as a breach of protocol.]{.mark}
He said the [move]{.mark} [disrespected Greenland's autonomy and]{.mark}
the [responsibilities it holds under the Kingdom of
Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Turn/ solvency deficit?

#### Mining in Greenland causes/runs into a laundry list of problems. 

Matt **Simon '25** \[a senior writer at Grist, covering climate
solutions. Prior to that, he spent over a decade at Wired magazine. He's
the author of three books, 03/26/25, "Beneath Greenland's ice lies a
climate solution --- and a new geopolitical
battleground,"<https://grist.org/energy/greenland-rare-earths-mining-geopolitics-china-us/>
\] EK

The question is whether mining companies can overcome the headaches
inherent in extracting rare earths from Greenland's ice-free yet still
frigid edges. An outfit [[would have to ship]{.mark} in all their
[equipment and build their own city at a remote mining site at
considerable cost.]{.mark} On top of that, it would be [difficult to
actually hire enough workers]{.mark} from the island's population of
laborers]{.underline}, so a mining company may need to hire
internationally and bring them in. Greenland has a population of 57,000,
just 65 of whom were involved in mining as of 2020, so the requisite
experience just isn't there. [["Labor laws are much more
strict]{.underline}]{.mark} than they would be in a Chinese rare earth
mine in Mongolia," Lajeunesse said. "All of those things factor together
to make [[Arctic development very expensive."]{.underline}]{.mark}

Still, the geopolitical pressure from China's domination of the rare
earths market has opened Greenland to exploration. No one needs to wait
for further deterioration of the island's ice sheet to get to work, as
there's enough ice-free land along these edges to dig through. Around 40
mining companies have exploration, prospecting, and exploitation
licenses in Greenland, with the majority of the firms based in
Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. "We can give you these
minerals," Hammeken-Holm said, "but you need to come to Greenland and do
the exploration."

\<\<graph omitted\>\>

One of those companies is Critical Metals Corp., which in September
drilled 14 holes on the coast of southern Greenland, about 16 miles from
the town of Qaqortoq. The New York-based company says it's found one of
the world's highest concentrations of gallium, which isn't technically a
rare earth element but is still essential in the manufacturing of
computer chips.

Dramatic change on and around the island, though, could [[make mining
for rare earths even more complicated]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the
loss of floating ice in the waters around the island makes it easier and
safer for ships to navigate, [more [chunks of glaciers will drop into
the ocean as]{.mark} the [world warms]{.mark}, [which could
become]{.mark} [especially hazardous for
ship]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}, à la the Titanic.

Even given the rapid loss of Greenland's 650,000-square-mile ice sheet,
though, it would take a long while to lose it all --- it's 1.4 miles
thick on average. The Earth itself is also frozen in parts of the
island, known as permafrost, which will thaw in the nearer term as
temperatures rise. "That\'s going to give you certainly instability in
terms of building access roads and such," said Paul Bierman, a geologist
at the University of Vermont and author of the book When the Ice Is
Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth\'s Tumultuous
History and Perilous Future. "The climate is changing, so I think it\'s
going to be a very dynamic environment in which to extract minerals."

Mining pollution, too, is a major concern: The accessible land along the
island's ice-free edges is also where humans live. [[As mining equipment
and ships burn fossil fuels, they produce black
carbon]{.underline}.]{.mark} When this settles on ice, it darkens the
surface, which then absorbs more sunlight --- think of how much hotter
you get wearing a black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day.
[[This]{.mark} could further [accelerate the melting of
Greenland's]{.mark} precarious [ice sheet]{.mark}.]{.underline} A 2022
study also found that [three legacy [mines in Greenland]{.mark} heavily
[polluted the local environment with metals,]{.mark} like lead and
zinc,]{.underline} due to the lack of environmental studies and
regulation prior to the 1970s. But it also found no significant
pollution at mines established in the last 20 years.

[[A]{.mark} more [immediate problem]{.mark} with mining [is]{.mark} the
[potentially toxic dust generated by]{.mark} so much
[machinery]{.mark}]{.underline}, said Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner
at NOAH, the Danish chapter of the environmental organization Friends of
the Earth. "[That\'s a [concern, because all the mining projects are
located in areas where people live]{.mark},]{.underline} or potentially
could live," Hooge said. ["[Everything]{.mark} is a bit [different in
the Arctic]{.mark}, [because]{.mark} the [environment does not recover
very quickly when polluted.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

The coast is clear

Greenland\'s active rare earth licenses

Lynge says that a win-win for Greenlanders would be to support mining
but insist that it's run on hydropower instead of fossil fuels. The
island has huge potential for hydropower, and indeed has been approving
more projects and expanding another existing facility. Still, no amount
of hydropower can negate the impact of mining on the landscape.
"There\'s no sustainable mining in the world," Lynge said. "The question
is if we can do it a little bit better."

Critical Metals Corp., for its part, says that it expects to produce
minimal harmful products at its site. Like other mining projects in
Greenland, it will need to pass an environmental review. "We expect to
provide more updates about our plans to reduce our environmental
footprint as we get closer to mining operations," said Tony Sage, the
company's CEO and executive chairman, in a statement provided to Grist.
"With that, we believe it is important to keep in mind that rare earth
elements are critical materials for cleaner applications, which will
help us build a greener planet in the future."

Still, [[wherever]{.mark} [there's mining activity, there's potential
for spills]{.mark}. There's [also]{.mark} potential for a lot of
[noise]{.mark}: [Ships]{.mark} in particular fill the ocean around
Greenland with a din that can [stress and disorient fishes and marine
mammals]{.mark}, like narwhals, seals, and whales. [For vocalizing
species, it can disrupt their communication.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## China Relations

### 1NC\-\--OFF

#### **US China relations are on the rebound\-\--economic ties and path dependencies**

Why It Matters Amid rising tensions between global powers, most notably
the US and China, the future of international cooperation seems
uncertain. But history suggests that [[even sharp]{.mark} political
[rifts may not lead to permanent splits]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and
understanding these cycles of coupling and decoupling has never been
more urgent. Key Takeaways Complementarities Bind Nations: Countries
stay coupled or recouple when they share political and economic
benefits, even after periods of conflict or separation. Decoupling Is
Often Temporary: Historical patterns show that [nations can and do
reconnect when underlying interests align again]{.underline}. Three
Recoupling Paths: The study identifies distinct historical patterns ---
full reconnection, enduring estrangement, and uncertain in-betweens ---
to help make sense of today's geopolitical shifts. Poli-Economic
Complementarities: What Keeps Countries Together Why do some nations
recover from a diplomatic split while others drift apart for good? The
answer lies in poli-economic complementarities --- the shared political
and economic gains two countries derive from their relationship. [When
[both sides benefit significantly from trade, investment,
security]{.mark}]{.underline} partnerships, [or ideological
alignment]{.underline}, [they\'re more likely to stay
connected]{.underline} or find their way back to each other after a
rupture. History matters too. [Countries with a long track record of
working together build habits, institutions, and expectations that
create path dependence]{.underline}, [making it harder to walk
away]{.underline} entirely. Even after tensions escalate, [residual ties
in supply chains, diplomacy, or cultural exchange can keep the door open
for future cooperation]{.underline}. Conversely, when complementarities
are weak to begin with, a break in ties is more likely to stick. \[Graph
Omitted\] The US Experience: Three Decoupling Journeys Drawing from five
cases in US foreign relations, the study maps out three broad
trajectories of coupling and decoupling: Break and Reconnect: Countries
like Britain, Germany, and Japan once had close ties with the US,
followed by deep ruptures --- from wars to revolutions. Yet strong
pre-existing complementarities allowed these relationships to bounce
back, transforming old enemies into key allies. Weak Ties, Permanent
Estrangement: The US--Soviet Union relationship was always distant, with
limited trade and political friction. The Cold War marked a long-lasting
decoupling, and even after the Soviet collapse, US--Russia relations
have remained strained, with little economic or strategic glue to hold
them together. Caught in the Middle: [The US and China represent a
hybrid path]{.underline}. [[Since the 1980s]{.underline}, **[their
economies became deeply intertwined]{.underline}**]{.mark} --- [through
trade, manufacturing, and investmen]{.underline}t. But recent years have
seen rising political rivalry and selective economic disengagement.
Though full decoupling hasn't occurred, the direction remains uncertain,
shaped by competing forces of dependency and distrust. Looking Ahead:
Decoupling Is Not Destiny **[The [notion of irreversible decoupling is
overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This research argues that [decoupling
is often a phase, not a final outcome]{.underline}. [Policymakers and
businesses should treat]{.underline} geopolitical [rifts as
dynamic]{.underline} --- not static --- recognising that [countries can
return to cooperation when circumstances change]{.underline}. [Even as
tensions]{.underline} between the US and China [grow]{.underline} ---
driven by national security concerns, ideological clashes, and trade
restrictions --- **[[the dense web of economic ties built over decades
still matters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Historical path
dependencies]{.underline}, **[such as [shared]{.mark}
[standards]{.mark}, [institutional]{.mark} [familiarity, and personal
networks, could ease a return to alignment]{.mark}]{.underline}** if
political conditions soften. **[This perspective offers]{.underline}**
cautious **[optimism]{.underline}**. For governments and businesses
alike, keeping channels open during periods of tension is not just a
diplomatic courtesy, but a strategic asset for future recovery. [The
study urges decision-makers to]{.underline} resist zero-sum thinking and
to [prepare for the possibility of renewed engagement]{.underline}.
Business Implications [Prepare for a Rebound]{.underline}: Today's
geopolitical rifts may be tomorrow's reconciliations. Companies should
include recoupling scenarios in their strategic planning and avoid
irreversible exits from foreign markets where long-term value still
exists. Preserve High-Value Links: Even amid decoupling, firms should
identify and maintain enduring partnerships, whether in supply chains,
joint ventures, or talent pipelines, that could be vital if relations
improve. Factor in History: A country-pair's shared past can inform
future risk. In regions with deep historical ties, total decoupling is
less likely to last. Businesses can use this insight to decide where to
scale back, hold steady, or lean in.

Although updated for contemporary circumstances, these dynamics remain
relevant today. Any strategy that focuses primarily on targeting the CCP
itself would therefore fail to significantly alter Chinese behavior.
Even if the United States tried to transform the character of the
Chinese party-state---by, for example, targeting [CCP leaders through
sanctions and supporting internal [challenges to the
government]{.mark}---**success [would be far from
guaranteed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such an approach misdiagnoses the
sources of Chinese assertiveness, and it would lock Beijing and
Washington into a dangerous and spiraling conflict.

Any attempt at regime change would likely fail and impose long-term
costs on U.S. efforts to shape Chinese behavior.

[[Any effort to hurt the CCP]{.mark} from the outside [would]{.mark}

After Taiwan\'s Fall," Pacific Forum International, Issues and Insights,

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the strategic [**nerve
center** of the **world**]{.mark}. **No other** flashpoint is as
structurally **unstable**, as]{.underline} politically vexing, and as
[likely to **draw** the world's leading **superpowers** into a
war]{.underline}. Through both word and deed, Chairman Xi Jinping and
the Chinese Communist Party ([[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}) elite [are
signaling their intention to [**annihilate**
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}'s government [[through]{.underline}]{.mark}
the use of overwhelming **[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a
growing concern in Washington that it may no longer be a question of if
a Chinese attack on Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Having lost one of its leading representatives, the [**free world**
would likely be in the presence of]{.underline} a
**[growing]{.underline}** sense that [**illiberal** forces]{.underline}
were on the march and **[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
[[spread]{.mark}ing in an **[unchecked]{.mark}** fashion]{.underline}.
The loss of Taiwan could [lead many democracies to experience a **crisis
of confidence**. [Many]{.mark}]{.underline} observers might
[[draw]{.mark} the [conclusion]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} Marxist-Leninist [[model]{.mark} was
**[superior]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or at the very least
ascendant---and liberal democracies too weak to resist the new world
order that Beijing was creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

[Taiwan's military **stands watch** over]{.underline} the vulnerable
flanks of **[Japan]{.underline}**'s southwestern approaches, protecting
Japan [and other **East Asian** countries from the threat of PRC
**expansionism**]{.underline}. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol and
monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

[If Taiwan falls, its military **bases** and
**intelligence**]{.underline} facilities [would be **occupied** by the
[PLA]{.mark}. The Chinese **navy** can be expected to base]{.underline}
its ships and submarines in Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases
at Su'ao and Keelung would be especially valuable for the PLA, [which
for the **first time**]{.underline} in its history would [[have
**unencumbered** access to]{.underline}]{.mark} the deep waters of the
[**[Pacific]{.mark}**. The **American**, **Japanese**, and
**Taiwanese**]{.underline} surveillance [systems]{.underline} that
currently track Chinese submarines in the shallow waters off the East
Asian littorals [would be]{.underline} rendered less effective (or
**[completely neutralized]{.underline}** in Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the [PLA would breach the **center**
of the First Island Chain]{.underline}. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
[[hold]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. forces in [**[Okinawa]{.mark}** and
[**Guam** at risk of]{.mark} **surprise [raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Chinese special forces and amphibious units [could use Taiwan to
**[invade]{.mark}** Japan's **[Ryukyu]{.mark}**]{.underline} islands
([**Yonaguni**, **Ishigaki**]{.underline}, etc.) [and Luzon, the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}' largest and most populated
island. PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in
Taiwan and the Penghu islands could [threaten a **blockade** of Japan
and South **[Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline} by cutting off their primary
sea lines of communication. The [top of the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [would be
"**corked**"]{.underline}---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further [reinforcing China's military
**dominance**]{.underline} of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline} negatively impact the health of
the U.S. economy and could [[trigger]{.mark} an economic
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in America and [[across]{.mark} the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent report asserted that
"[[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the **most [critical link]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the entire **[tech]{.mark}**nology [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline},"
[due to its **dominance** in]{.underline} the **[chip
sector]{.underline}**, original equipment manufacturing, original design
manufacturing, and role as a central hub for producing
technology-related materials. The report found, "Taiwan currently serves
as a [key supplier]{.underline} and partner [to]{.underline} many
leading [U.S. **tech**nology **firms** like Apple, Nvidia, Texas
Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S. allies
globally]{.underline}."8 [That would all **disappear**]{.underline},
forcing companies to suffer massive profit losses at the very moment
they needed to invest in costly new facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the Great Depression. In any event, globalization
would probably cease to exist, as the world splintered into hostile
trade and security blocs. [**[Supply chains]{.mark}**,
already]{.underline} significantly [impacted by]{.underline} the
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline}, the Russian invasion of [Ukraine,
and]{.underline} instability in the [Middle East, would be
[**shattered**. Prices]{.mark} would
**[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Panic buying and hording would be
followed by a [[surge in **nativism** and]{.mark} strong impulse
toward]{.underline} trade **[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
self-sufficiency.

Harsh Geostrategic Realities

By seizing Taiwan, the [[PRC]{.mark} would have]{.underline} effectively
[**carved** out a **[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}phere
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence for
itself in Asia using violent methods. This invasion would [have grave
implications for **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}, the ideal of
national self-determination, and the principle of state sovereignty. The
fall of Taiwan [would undermine **perceptions** of U.S.]{.underline}
global diplomatic and **[military leadership]{.underline}**, straining
(and possibly **[[brea]{.mark}king]{.underline}**) [the American
**alliance**]{.underline} system [and]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
System. [China would be]{.underline} viewed as [the **most powerful**
nation in the **world**]{.underline} and the primary mover of the 21st
century. Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
[toward]{.underline} its vision of a **[new]{.underline}** centralized,
[**authoritarian** world order]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing**]{.underline}]{.mark} would start and [could
[easily]{.mark} rapidly **[spiral]{.mark}** out of control]{.underline}.
The likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking
out could [[climb]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} than anything
previously seen. It can be expected that the [**world** would begin
sliding toward]{.underline} the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**, and
human [**[civilization]{.mark}** would risk being **[knocked
backward]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its developmental story. Abstract
ideas like international law and universal values would increasingly
appear quaint, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of
empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} could be expected to
go nuclear and [[become]{.mark} heavily
**[militarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tokyo would likely be in the grip
of a profound sense of insecurity and disillusionment with U.S. defense
guarantees. It is possible that [Japanese politics could [swing
in]{.mark} a **right-wing**, [**authoritarian** direction]{.mark}.
Alternatively]{.underline}, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and Japan might [end up **band wagoning**
with China]{.underline}. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country could
experience a wave of political violence. Over time, it may even be
[possible]{.underline} that [Japan would become a
**dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [**South [Korea]{.mark}** would
likely [go **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by [building an independent **deterrent
force**]{.underline}. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the [**Philippines**,
**Indonesia**, **Malaysia**]{.underline}, and other Southeast Asia
nations that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they
had no choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves [with
Beijing]{.underline} against the United States.

[**[North]{.mark} Korea** would likely be
**[emboldened]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken and, if possible, [**destroy** South
Korea's government and affect a **[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States
drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems
probable that North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking
South Korea. [Beijing]{.underline} is likely to [see the situation as an
**opportunity** to drive American forces **off** the Asian mainland.
China's government would]{.underline} probably
**[encourage]{.underline}** and support some degree of [North Korean
aggression]{.underline}. At a minimum, an unprecedented campaign of
coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war. At the same
time, CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would
struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly **[expand]{.mark}**
its **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear weapons [arsenal and further
**[build up]{.mark}** its conventional **[military]{.mark}** along the
**border**]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, the [[PLA]{.mark} would
likely [focus on **re-taking**]{.mark} territories controlled by
**[Delhi]{.mark}**]{.underline} as its next major mission.
[[**Australia** will fear]{.mark} being
**[encircled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and isolated as the Chinese military
pushes across the South Pacific. [**Canberra** might opt to
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} its own independent [[**nuclear**
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} program and accelerate plans to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a distinctive
crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective security
organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe [[would **fray**]{.mark}. Combined Chinese and
Russian **influence**]{.underline} campaigns might [**succeed** in
getting [countries]{.mark} such as **Germany**, **France**, and
**Italy** to [embrace **pro-Beijing** policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
drive them against the United States [and **fatally [fracture]{.mark}**
the NATO [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} network. [[European
**disunion**]{.mark} might [follow]{.mark}, throwing the continent
into]{.underline} a political environment eerily reminiscent of the
1920s and [19**30s**]{.underline}.

### Uniqueness\-\--2NC

#### New summit and easing restrictions are expected to stabilize relations.

"Trump says a China trip is 'not too distant' as trade tensions ease",

WASHINGTON (AP) --- [President Donald [Trump]{.mark} on Tuesday [said
**a trip to China might be "not too distant,"**]{.mark} raising
prospects that the leaders of the world's two largest economies may meet
soon to help reset relations after moving to climb down from a trade
war.]{.underline}

Trump made the remarks while hosting Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos Jr. at the White House, where he praised the "fantastic military
relationship" with Manila as the U.S. looks to counter China's influence
in the Indo-Pacific region.

[Yet, **[Trump]{.mark} still [said]{.mark} [the U.S. is "getting along
with China very well]{.mark}**. We have a very good
relationship]{.underline}." He added that Beijing has resumed shipping
to the U.S. "record numbers" of much-needed rare earth magnets, which
are used in iPhones and other high-tech products like electric vehicles.

[Widely speculated about since Trump returned to the White House, a
[summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would be
**expected to stabilize**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- even for a short
while --- a difficult relationship defined by mistrust and competition.

[[Beijing believes]{.mark} [a]{.mark} leader-level [summit]{.mark} [is
necessary to steady U.S.-China relations]{.mark} and that Trump must be
wooed because he has the final say on America's policy toward
China,]{.underline} despite more hawkish voices in his Cabinet,
observers say.

The question, however, is when.

Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy
Institute, said Trump has consistently shown his hunger for a visit to
China and that Beijing has used that to bolster leverage.

"As soon as the leadership in Beijing is satisfied that Trump will be on
his best behavior and will accept terms for a deal that they think are
favorable, they will give a green light to the visit," Russel said.

Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think
tank Stimson Center, said a visit "is in the making" with two sides
likely to strike a trade deal.

What Trump said might mean the visit would not be in September but
"potentially November, but still depends on whether they play ball on
trade and other things we want," Sun said.

Trump's campaign to impose tariffs on other countries kicked off a
high-stake trade war with Beijing. China raised tariffs on U.S. goods to
125% in response to Trump's hiking the tax on Chinese goods to 145%.

Both sides also imposed on each other harsh trade restrictions on
critical products: China on rare earths, and the U.S. on computing chips
and jet engine technology.

Trade tensions, however, eased following two rounds of high-level talks
in Geneva and London, when the two sides agreed to lower tariffs ---
pending a more permanent deal by mid-August --- and pull back on trade
restrictions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday on Fox Business' "Mornings
with Maria" that he will be meeting with his Chinese counterparts in
Stockholm next week to work on "what is likely an extension" of the Aug.
12 deadline.

"I think trade is in a very good place with China," Bessent told host
Maria Bartiromo. "Hopefully, we can see the Chinese pull back on some of
this glut of manufacturing that they're doing and concentrate on
building a consumer economy."

He said he also expects to bring up China's purchases of Russian and
Iranian oil and Beijing's role in aiding Moscow in its war against
Ukraine.

Beijing has not announced any travel plans for Vice Premier He Lifeng,
who led trade negotiations in both Geneva and London on behalf of the
Chinese government, but it is not unusual for China to make such
announcements closer to a travel date.

[In a possible friendly gesture, [Beijing]{.mark} on Tuesday said it
**[suspended an antitrust investigation into chemical maker DuPont's
operations]{.mark} in China**.]{.underline} China's State Administration
for Market Regulation made the announcement in a one-line statement but
gave no explanation for the decision.

DuPont said in a statement that it is "pleased" with China's action.

Chinese regulators launched the investigation in April against DuPont
China Group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant, as part of Beijing's
broad, retaliatory response to Trump's sky-high tariffs.

[[Beijing]{.mark} [also has agreed to approve export **permits for
r**]{.mark}**are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements** and rare earth
magnets that U.S. manufacturers need to build cars, robots, wind
turbines and other high-tech products. [The U.S. has eased restrictions
on **some advanced chips and other technologies.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### US-China relations are up in the air, but there are factions trying to shape the President in China's favor. 

**Sun 7/23** , fellow at the Centre for International Security and
Strategy at Tsinghua University, a Munich Young Leader 2025 and the
founder of the the newsletter ChinAffairsplus (Chenghao, 7/23/2025, "Why

https://www.scmp.com/opinion/china-opinion/article/3319004/why-i-am-hopeful-about-us-china-ties-despite-trumps-tariff-tangle)

I recently travelled to Washington and New York, where I held in-depth
discussions with a range of people from the strategic, academic and
business communities on China-US relations. These conversations gave me
a more nuanced understanding of both the current dynamics and the
potential trajectory of bilateral ties in the next phase.

A key takeaway is that while [there is consensus within the Trump
administration that the US is engaged in]{.underline} a strategic
[competition with China]{.underline}, [its approach
is highly]{.underline} personalised and [transactional]{.underline},
[without a long-term strategy]{.underline}. [[Different]{.mark}
[factions]{.mark} and voices within the US]{.underline} government
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} actively [[competing to shape the president's
perceptions of China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [resulting in a policymaking
process marked by uncertainty]{.underline}.

To many, [[the most pressing issue is]{.mark} the]{.underline} future of
the [[economic]{.mark} relationship]{.underline},
[[especially]{.underline} [how the tariff war might
shape]{.underline}]{.mark} broader [[dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}. Once
seen as the ballast of the relationship, trade and economics have now
become one of its most destabilising elements. US President Donald Trump
regards tariffs as a long-term strategic tool.

Still, [Trump's tariff strategy cannot escape]{.underline} the
constraints of domestic [economic and political realities]{.underline}.
US Federal Reserve chair Jerome [Powell]{.underline} has
[warned]{.underline} that [Trump's policies could push up
inflation]{.underline} risks. Once the inflationary impact of the
tariffs begins to bite and voter dissatisfaction rises, [**[Trump may be
forced to adjust his trade stance]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### Link\-\--Deterrence\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Deterrence efforts provoke China.

HongruiH

Observers say the US move to expand its military footprint in the
Philippines reflects a shift towards ["distributed [deterrence]{.mark}"
-- dispersing forces and weapons across multiple locations to
[complicate Chinese strategic planning.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"With the revival of the EDCA, the Philippines is no longer seen merely
as a logistical partner but as a forward-operating platform for
deterrence," Leveau said. "It is a form of calibrated entrenchment
demonstrating long-term commitment that avoids provocations that could
be associated with permanent bases."

[Gorska said [Washington was "rehearsing escalation scenarios in
advance]{.mark}", [aligning]{.mark} geography, [logistics]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} legal [frameworks to allow rapid
response.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[She described the Marcos government's expanded cooperation under EDCA
as enabling "scalable deterrence"]{.underline} -- a flexible posture
that maximised military presence without triggering domestic backlash or
requiring treaty revisions.

[But [not all experts believe the strategy is
foolproof.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["Relying on a [deterrence-heavy or deterrence-only strategy can easily
provoke more than defend]{.mark}," Shidore said.]{.underline} "Pulling
the Philippines into a Taiwan scenario can be risky, as there is a
mismatch of core interests between Washington and Manila on Taiwan."

[[Time for a strategy shift]{.underline}]{.mark}

A two year effort from 2017-2019 at the Naval War College called
"Breaking the Mold" examined alternative means to implement the NDS. For
the Indo-Pacific theater, a Mobile Maritime and Porcupine Defense for
Taiwan was proposed in close concert with allies. That Japan is
increasing defense spending is one indication of greater allied concern,
as is the AUKUS program to provide nuclear submarines to Australia.

This Mobile Maritime strategy would confine the PLA to the first island
chain running from Japan through Taiwan to Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Vietnam. As in World War II in the Pacific against Japan, China
would be blockaded and denied access to overseas access and resupply. It
would be cut off from its Belt and Road outposts. And by Taiwan adopting
a Porcupine Defense to make a PLA invasion too costly to consider, the
United States would not have to spend as many resources in deterring and
preparing for that contingency.

[If an opposed-entry invasion of Taiwan is beyond China's capacity, and
it could be prevented by a Porcupine Defense of the island, what would
be the consequences for US strategy? If Taiwan is not the immediate or
even long-term danger spot the US believes it is, then is it time to ask
if US strategy towards China has become overly militarized.]{.underline}

De-militarizing the China strategy

Tensions between China and the United States, if anything, are
worsening. The specter of a world war has been raised with Taiwan as the
cause célèbre. Rather than examining means to improve relations or to
lower tensions, this focus on a Taiwan scenario has taken on greater
importance and probability of occurrence. [[In this situation]{.mark},
[the response has been for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to
increase its emphasis on defense]{.mark} as the de facto policy and
strategy. While this is understandable, [it]{.mark} clearly [has overly
militarized US strategy at the expense of other
options]{.mark}.]{.underline}

During the Cold War, the United States fought a war against China in
Korea and believed that the People's Republic of China (PRC) was the
surrogate enemy in Vietnam. The Nixon administration reversed this
thinking with its "triangular politics" to offset the Soviet Union,
culminating with then President Richard Nixon's famous visit to China in
1972.

[[The United States needs to undertake a major review of its China
policy]{.mark} to determine if it has become overly
militarized]{.underline} and, if so, what are the alternatives. Further,
are there positive steps that can be taken vis-a-vis China in the best
interests of all concerned?

[[Too often]{.mark} in the past, instead of being the last option,
[military force, threatened or used, has become the default US
position]{.mark}. [The United States is at risk of repeating that
error]{.mark}. It may well be that the PRC is indeed the greatest threat
to the United States and its allies. However, [a race to that judgment
is ill-advised]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps the Congressional-Executive
Commission on China can fill the gap in shaping a strategy.

[A U.S. warship conducted a freedom of navigation operation in the South
China Sea, near the Parcel Islands]{.underline}, the day after China
claimed it chased away the ship from its territorial waters, U.S. 7th
Fleet announced Friday.

[USS Milius (DDG-69) sailed near the Parcel Islands and then into the
South China Sea, according to the release.]{.underline} On Thursday, a
Chinese spokesperson said the People's Liberation Army forces chased
away the guided missile destroyer after it sailed into its territorial
waters. The U.S. Navy denied these accusations.

["This freedom of navigation operation ("**[FONOP]{.mark}")** upheld the
rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international
law by [challenging]{.mark} [the]{.mark} restrictions on innocent
passage imposed by the People's Republic of China ([PRC]{.mark}),
Taiwan, and Vietnam [and]{.mark} also by [challenging PRC's claim to
straight baselines]{.mark} enclosing the Paracel Islands," reads the
release.]{.underline}

The Parcel Islands are claimed by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and they
reach require permission or notification before a warship may sail
through the waters around them, according to the release

The People's Republic of China has claimed straight baselines around the
islands, which the United States sees as a violation of international
sea law, according to the release.

"By conducting this operation, the United States demonstrated that these
waters are beyond what the PRC can lawfully claim as its territorial
sea, and that the PRC claimed straight baselines around the Paracel
Islands are inconsistent with international law," reads the release.

Milius was in the Sea of Japan earlier this week conducting an exercise
with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force JS Atago (DDG-177).

In a statement, Chinese authorities protested the operation on Friday.

[**"The act of [the U.S. military seriously violated China's sovereignty
and security]{.mark}**, severely breached international laws, and is
more ironclad evidence of the U.S. pursuing navigation hegemony and
militarizing the South [China]{.mark} Sea,"]{.underline} ministry

**[[China is also home to the majority of the world's clean energy
equipment]{.mark} manufacturing]{.underline}**. [Chinese firms produce
60% of the world's electric vehicles (EVs), 80% of its lithium-ion
batteries, and over 95% of its solar wafers.]{.underline} Costs for
these products have tumbled globally, stimulating energy policy
rethinking around the world, particularly through the widespread
cancellation of new coal developments in the Global South. For example,
Indonesia and Vietnam have repeatedly revised their coal development
plans and have signed up for ambitious Just Energy Transition
Partnership goals with mostly Western international donors. With regard
to EVs specifically, China-based EV producers (including Chinese firms
such as BYD and foreign firms such as Tesla) have begun exporting to
other markets, leading to trade tensions in countries seeking to build a
domestic EV market.

Despite these consequential trends, China appears to be doubling down on
coal at home due to resurging concerns about energy security. Following
major energy shortage events in 2021 and 2022, China's top leaders have
embraced a central role for coal in the medium term while cautioning
against an overly ambitious replacement of fossil infrastructure with
clean alternatives. These policies, which have led to increased coal
power generation and the largest permitting wave of new coal-fired power
plants in a decade, have reversed recent falling carbon intensity trends
(the measure of emissions generated per economic output). They also have
generated questions outside of China about the credibility of Beijing's
climate leadership.

Challenges and opportunities for the United States

[[The **U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces]{.mark} a [different
set of]{.mark} drivers and [obstacles]{.mark} in meeting its climate
targets.**]{.underline} [The United States is making progress, though it
still falls short of what is required to meet its 2030 carbon emissions
target.]{.underline} Beyond 2030, the United States will need to
significantly ramp up its deployment and integration of clean energy if
it is to achieve the aspirational goal of 100% clean electricity by
2035. Industrial policies such as the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
have heavily subsidized deployment as well as domestic production,
leading to a renaissance of clean technology manufacturing. Support for
the IRA was generated in part by the desire to reduce risk in the U.S.
supply chain and create resilience and redundancy. [**The two
goals**---clean tech deployment and China de-risking---**are now
intertwined;** conventional wisdom suggests this linkage is necessary to
maintain and strengthen any U.S. political coalition for climate policy.
However, **[China's]{.mark} [lead in manufacturing know-how and scale
makes it an indispensable partner to decarbonize
quickly.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

For the United States, making progress on climate means continuing to
deploy clean energy technologies even if China backslides on coal. The
world will need to decarbonize energy sectors by around mid-century to
avoid the worst effects of climate change. For both the United States
and China, there is a clear advantage to being at the forefront of new
energy technologies. Particularly in emerging areas like hydrogen and
green industrial products, U.S. firms with hefty industrial policy
support are now much better positioned to step in and compete. Yet as
Chinese firms continue to lead the world in cost and quality for mature
clean tech, including solar, wind, and EVs, it will be important to
figure out ways to cooperate with Chinese firms to the U.S. advantage.
This is an area where targeted policy recourse, as opposed to broad
bans, can help reduce the risks of integration. Both U.S. presidential
candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, generally support continuing
or ratcheting up tariffs on Chinese imports. The Biden administration
recently proposed rules that would effectively ban Chinese EVs on U.S.
roads. Trump has suggested in the past an openness to Chinese investment
in U.S. auto factories.

The most effective forms of international environmental cooperation have
involved a focus on innovation and problem-solving, though this is
challenging for the United States and China owing to their different
development stages and increasing geopolitical tensions. Prior to Paris,
there was optimism about jointly solving key technological and market
challenges, in areas as diverse as building energy efficiency and
electric vehicles. [Today, [bilateral]{.mark} [climate discussions
between the countries']{.mark} climate envoys [are carefully
circumscribed by]{.mark} the Glasgow (2021) and Sunnylands (2023)
[statements]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several expert working groups have
been created to address technical topics. Agreements to control potent
methane gas and to expand the included list of greenhouse gases in the
next round of Paris Agreement commitments for 2035, due next year, have
been rare diplomatic accomplishments in an otherwise fraught
relationship. Addressing industrial policies, trade remedies, and
technology restrictions for clean energy are not part of the climate
envoys' remit and have instead been elevated to both sides' senior
national security and commerce officials. Little visible progress has
been made to resolve key disputes over industrial subsidies and
localization.

In the U.N. climate framework, the United States has a strong incentive
to push China to set aggressive 2035 targets, reflecting the widespread
observation that its 2030 emissions and renewable energy pledges were
underwhelming. Space also remains for continued discussion of China's
coal growth, especially if framed in the broader context of how to move
both countries' power systems off of fossil fuels. Climate finance is a
key point of contention in the international negotiations, where the
United States and China are similarly at odds. While China contributes
to finance, it would rather not be seen on the same footing, or as
having the same responsibility, as other donor countries. Still, there
are opportunities for coordination---if not collaboration---on financing
the green transition in third countries.

[A longer-term challenge for the next [U.S. administration will be to
create a constructive relationship when there are both intense
conflicts]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [pressing needs to collaborate]{.mark}.
**[There is time to "get China right]{.mark}"** by ensuring that good
behavior is reciprocated [and]{.mark} [communication on key redlines is
clear.]{.mark}]{.underline} [I]{.mark}n the area of climate, defending
national interests and firms through intense diplomatic jockeying is to
be expected. But managing the political economy of the growing interests
and stakeholders should not come at the expense of the long-term goals
of the global clean energy transition.

Years later, China found its relationship with North Korea diminished
once again when Xi Jinping sought to establish "New Great Power
Relations" with Washington. [These efforts, emphasizing non-collision,
[non-confrontation]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [mutual respect between the

While China didn't take proactive measures to prevent North Korea from
evading sanctions through China's own economy, its coordination on
international sanctions marked a significant improvement compared to its
previous stance, which had unilaterally advocated North Korea since
Premier Wen Jiabao's visit to Pyongyang in October 2009. [During the

commitment to the **denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula**]{.mark},

after the prospect of the negotiations between President Donald Trump

Sino-American strategic competition, North Korea and China could hold
five rounds of summitry, including Xi's visit to Pyongyang in June 2019.

[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis. For many years,
**[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including a group of [more than
**[15,000]{.mark}**, have [sounded]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[alarm]{.mark} about]{.underline} the [impending dangers of climate
change]{.underline} driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions and
ecosystem change (Ripple et al. 2020). For half a century, global
[warming has been correctly predicted even before it was
observed]{.underline}---and not only by independent academic scientists
but also by fossil fuel companies (Supran et al. 2023). Despite these
warnings, [we are [**still** moving in]{.mark} the **[wrong
direction]{.mark}**; fossil fuel emissions have increased
to]{.underline} an [all-time high]{.underline}, the 3 hottest days ever
occurred in July of 2024 (Guterres 2024), and [current policies have us
[on track for]{.mark}]{.underline} approximately [**[2.7]{.mark}**
degrees]{.underline} Celsius (°C) peak warming by 2100 (UNEP 2023).
Tragically, [we are failing to avoid **serious impacts**]{.underline},
and we can now only hope to limit the extent of the damage. We are
witnessing the grim reality of the forecasts as [climate
impacts]{.underline} escalate, [bringing forth]{.underline} scenes of
**[unprecedented disasters]{.underline}** around the world and human and
nonhuman suffering. We find ourselves amid an abrupt climate upheaval, a
dire situation never before encountered in the annals of human
existence. We have now brought the planet into climatic conditions never
witnessed by us or our prehistoric relatives within our
genus, Homo (supplemental figure S1; CenCO2PIP Consortium et al. 2023).

Last year, we witnessed [**record-breaking** sea surface
temperatures]{.underline} (Cheng et al. 2024), the hottest Northern
Hemisphere extratropical summer in 2000 years (Esper et al. 2024), and
the [breaking of]{.underline} many other **[climate
records]{.underline}** (Ripple et al. 2023a). Moreover, we will see much
more extreme weather in the coming years (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2021).
[**Human**-caused]{.underline} carbon dioxide [emissions]{.underline}
and other greenhouse gases [are]{.underline} the **[primary drivers of
climate change]{.underline}**. As of 2022, global fossil fuel combustion
and industrial processes account for approximately 90% of these
emissions, whereas land-use change, primarily deforestation, accounts
for approximately 10% (supplemental figure S2).

Our aim in the present article is to communicate directly to
researchers, policymakers, and the public. As scientists and academics,
we feel it is our moral duty and that of our institutions to alert
humanity to the growing threats that we face as clearly as possible and
to show leadership in addressing them. In this report, we analyze the
latest trends in a wide array of planetary vital signs. We also review
notable recent climate-related disasters, spotlight important
climate-related topics, and discuss needed policy interventions. This
report is part of our series of concise annual updates on the state of
the climate.

Recent trends in planetary vital signs

In [2023]{.underline}, various historical [[temperature and ice]{.mark}
extent [records were **broken** by **enormous
margins**]{.mark}]{.underline} (figure 1; Ripple et al. 2023a). Both
global and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures were far above their
1991--2024 averages for much of the year---a pattern that has continued
well into 2024 (figure 1a, 1b). Although Antarctic and global sea **[ice
extent]{.underline}** have now come into range of previous years, they
[remain well below]{.underline} their [1993--2024 averages]{.underline}
(figure 1c, 1d). Global daily mean temperatures were at record levels
for nearly half of 2023 and much of 2024 (figure 1e). On our current
emissions trajectory, we may regularly surpass current temperature
records in future years (Matthews and Wynes 2022).

\<\<FIGURES 1-3, TABLE 1 OMITTED\>\>

The human enterprise

Our graphical account illustrates how [humanity\'s]{.underline}
collective [size and **consumption**]{.underline} patterns [continued to
accelerate]{.underline} on multiple fronts. Although fertility rates
were down slightly to a record low in 2023, other variables set all-time
record highs, including human population, ruminant livestock population,
per capita meat production, and gross domestic product (GDP;
figure 2a--2e). Human population and ruminant livestock population have
been increasing at approximately 200,000 and 170,000 per day
respectively. Decoupling the growth in all of these variables with
greenhouse gas emissions may be difficult (Ripple et al. 2024).

Energy

[**[Fossil fuel consumption]{.mark}** rose]{.underline} by 1.5% in 2023
relative to 2022 (figure 2h), mostly because of substantial increases in
coal consumption (1.6%) and oil consumption (2.5%; figure 2h). Renewable
energy use also grew in 2023, with solar and wind consumption together
rising 15% relative to 2022 (figure 2h). Much of this growth can be
attributed to the fact that renewable energy is often cheaper than
comparable new fossil fuel alternatives (Roser 2020). However, fossil
fuel consumption [[remains]{.mark} roughly [**14 times greater** than
solar and wind]{.mark} energy consumption]{.underline} (figure 2h) and
[recent growth in]{.underline} the **[renewable share]{.underline}** of
electricity generation mostly [covered increased **demand**, instead of
**replacing fossil fuels**]{.underline} (REN21 2024).

Forests

Global [**tree cover loss** rose]{.underline} from 22.8 megahectares
(Mha) per year in 2022 to 28.3 Mha per year in 2023, [reaching its
third-highest level]{.underline} (figure 2f); this was at least [partly
because of **wildfires**]{.underline}, which caused tree cover loss to
reach a record high of 11.9 Mha (figure 3n). High rates of [**[tree
cover loss]{.mark}** can [drive]{.mark}]{.underline} a set of related
**[[feedback loops]{.underline}]{.mark}**, wherein the [loss of forest
carbon sequestration leads to **additional warming**]{.underline}, which
can drive further losses in carbon sequestration and so on (Ripple
et al. 2023b, Goldman and Carter 2024). [This]{.underline} type of
climate carbon **[feedback]{.underline}** process [could
**[limit]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [success of]{.underline} some
**[[natural]{.mark} climate [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2023,
there was also a dramatic decline in the land carbon sink according to
Ke and colleagues (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12447 \[preprint:
not peer reviewed\]). On a more positive note, the deforestation rate in
the Brazilian Amazon continued to decline, dropping from 1.16 Mha in
2022 to 0.90 Mha in 2023 (figure 2g). This decrease may be partly
because of the shifting policies of Brazil\'s government (Vilani
et al. 2023) and comes at a critical time given that the Amazon may be
nearing a tipping point where a loss of resilience and positive feedback
loops contribute to large-scale forest dieback (Boulton et al. 2022,
Flores et al. 2024).

Global greenhouse gases and temperature

Annual [energy]{.underline}-related [emissions
**increased**]{.underline} 2.1% in 2023, and are now above 40 gigatons
of carbon-dioxide-equivalent for the first time (figure 2k). The top
three emitting countries are China, the United States, and India, which,
together, account for over half of global emissions (supplemental table
S2). Anthropogenic emissions of aerosol pollutants are declining;
because these aerosols have a net cooling effect, this reduction may be
causing the rate of global warming to accelerate (Hansen et al. 2023).
On the basis of global year-to-date averages, the [concentrations of
carbon dioxide and methane are at **record highs**]{.underline}
(figure 3a, 3b). Carbon dioxide levels were recently observed to be
surging (NOAA 2024). Furthermore, the growth rate of methane emissions
has been accelerating, which is very troubling (Shindell et al. 2024).
Nitrous oxide is also at a record high (figure 3c); annual anthropogenic
emissions of this potent long-lived greenhouse gas have increased by
roughly 40% from 1980 to 2020 (Tian et al. 2024).

[Surface temperature is at a **record high**]{.underline}, and 2024 is
expected to be one of the hottest years ever recorded (figure 3d). Each
0.1°C of global warming places an extra 100 million people (or more)
into unprecedented hot average temperatures (Lenton et al. 2023). On our
current trajectory, future years will almost certainly be even hotter,
because our climate continues to shift away from conditions associated
with human thriving for much of Earth\'s population (Vecellio
et al. 2023). Even in the most optimistic scenarios, large-scale climate
adaptation efforts will be needed, particularly for the most vulnerable
populations (Ripple et al. 2022).

Oceans and ice

Ocean acidity and ocean heat content are both at record extremes
(figure 3f, 3g), which has led to various ocean-related climate impacts.
For example, heat waves in 2021 and 2023 caused marine animal mass
mortality events (White et al. 2023, Goreau and Hayes 2024). In
addition, the average [global [sea level is]{.mark} presently
[at]{.mark} a **[record high]{.mark}**]{.underline}, mostly because of
both overall warming and a strong El Niño in 2023 and part of 2024
(figure 3h; Lee 2024). Continued sea level rise [has]{.underline} the
[potential to displace **hundreds of millions** of people]{.underline}
over the course of the century (Kulp and Strauss 2019). Melting
continental ice contributes about half to sea level rise (Horwath
et al. 2021), and the latest data indicate that Greenland's ice mass,
Antarctica's ice mass, and the average glacier thickness are all at
record lows (figure 3j--3l).

Climate impacts and extreme weather

Climate-related extreme weather and disasters are contributing greatly
to human suffering (figure 4). Increasing heat and rainfall extremes are
now far outside the historical climate (Robinson et al. 2021). The
[rapid increase in average global temperatures]{.underline} (figure 1e)
has led to a massive rise in the incidence of heat extremes (figure 3p).
This is [linked to]{.underline} many [**adverse human outcomes**,
including]{.underline} direct [mortality]{.underline}, increased
[healthcare costs]{.underline}, mental health issues, and [deaths
from]{.underline} cardiorespiratory **[diseases]{.underline}** (Ebi
et al. 2021). Climate change has already contributed to billions of
people facing extreme heat (Arrighi et al. 2024). Heat-related mortality
is rising rapidly in the United States (Figure 2i); the number of
heat-related deaths increased by 117% from 1999 to 2023 (Howard et
al. 2024). Last year, there were four billion-dollar floods in the
United States (a tie for the record; figures 3o and S4). Since the
publication of our last report (Ripple et al. 2023a), numerous other
major climate-related disasters have occurred, including a series of
[**[heat waves]{.mark}** across Asia]{.underline} that [[killed more
than a **thousand**]{.mark} **people** and led to temperatures reaching
50°C]{.underline} in some parts of India (table 1). Because [the [Earth
system is **strongly nonlinear**, extreme weather]{.mark} and disaster
rates can [increase **dramatically**]{.mark} in response to]{.underline}
global **[warming]{.underline}**, including impacts on plant and animal
life (figure 3m, 3o and supplemental figures S4 and S5; Calvin 2019,
Robinson et al. 2021).

\<\<FIGURE 4 OMITTED\>\>

Climate spotlight

In the present section, we spotlight recent developments in various
different climate-related areas: coral bleaching, toxic orange rivers,
solar radiation modification (SRM) research, climate scientists' opinion
on global temperatures, climate change as a social justice issue,
climate feedback loops and tipping points, and the risk of societal
collapse.

Coral bleaching

Coral reefs benefit millions of people by providing a wide range of
ecosystem services, including coastal protection, improved water
quality, fisheries, and tourism opportunities; they also provide habitat
for many species (Woodhead et al. 2019). **[Climate]{.underline}**
change [is a particularly serious threat to **coral reefs**]{.underline}
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2017). Warm-water coral death is sometimes
preceded by bleaching---the loss of a symbiotic relationship with
microalgae (figure 5a; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2017). When a sharp spike
in sea temperature unfolds well above the long-term average summer
maximum, many [corals die **quickly** within a week or two without
having time to bleach]{.underline}. Others bleach and either die more
slowly over a period of a few months or regain their color and survive
(Hughes et al. 2018). As of 2024, extraordinarily [warm]{.underline}
ocean [[temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark} (figure 1a) [are
[driving]{.mark}]{.underline} the fourth **[[global]{.mark}-scale [coral
bleaching]{.mark}]{.underline}** event ever recorded (previous events:
1998, 2010, 2014--2017; Thiem 2024).

\<\<FIGURE 5 OMITTED\>\>

Toxic orange rivers

Climate change in the Arctic is altering watershed hydrology and water
biogeochemistry. Recently, researchers have observed an emergent threat
in Arctic streams that turned orange because of increased iron and toxic
metals (figure 5b). This discoloration began in the last decade,
coinciding with rapid global warming and permafrost thaw (O\'Donnell
et al. 2024). Compared with clear streams, orange streams are more
acidic, have higher turbidity, and have elevated sulfate, iron, and
trace metals. This discoloration correlates with declines in
macroinvertebrate diversity and fish abundance, affecting drinking water
and subsistence fisheries in rural Alaska (O\'Donnell et al. 2024).

Solar radiation modification research

SRM research, also known as solar geoengineering research, has been
dramatically increasing in recent years (figure 5c). It involves
potentially risky techniques to reflect sunlight away from Earth to
mitigate climate change effects. General categories of SRM include
atmospheric, terrestrial, and space-based applications (Keith 2020).
Specific methods, for example, include injecting aerosols into the
stratosphere or brightening marine clouds. The Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that stratospheric aerosol
injection is the most-researched SRM method, but there are a number of
environmental concerns (IPCC 2018, Visioni et al. 2020). SRMs are also
controversial because of potential unintended consequences and ethical
concerns. Critics argue that it is misguided and may disrupt weather
patterns and deter emissions reduction efforts (Whyte 2018). However,
research continues to explore its feasibility and risks. SRM is often
seen as a temporary, potentially important solution to both reduce
warming and corresponding damages including for the highly important and
fast-warming subpolar regions (Smith et al. 2022). Research into solar
geoengineering needs to focus on understanding the potential
environmental, social, and geopolitical impacts, as well as assessing
effectiveness and safety on both regional and global scales (Sovacool
et al. 2022). In addition, interdisciplinary research is required to
explore ethical, legal, and governance frameworks, along with public
perception and acceptance, while emphasizing the critical importance of
drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There is a consensus
study available as a roadmap for solar geoengineering research and
research governance (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine 2021).

Climate scientists' opinion on global temperatures

A [2024]{.underline} opinion [poll]{.underline} has
[unveiled]{.underline} the [**predictions** of **hundreds of
[prominent]{.mark} climate [scientists]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[IPCC, senior authors, and review editors (380
respondents)]{.underline}. From a personal perspective, nearly [**80%**
of]{.underline} these [scientists [anticipate]{.mark}]{.underline}
global [[temperatures]{.mark} increasing by **[at least
2.5]{.mark}°C**]{.underline} above preindustrial levels by the end of
the century (Carrington 2024). Nearly [half]{.underline} of them
[foresee]{.underline} a rise of [at least 3°C]{.underline}. A mere
[**6%** believe]{.underline} that the internationally agreed-on [limit
of 1.5°C will be achieved]{.underline} (figure 5d). This parallels an
earlier survey of IPCC scientists, which showed that approximately 60%
expected warming of at least 3°C (Tollefson 2021). These projections
paint a bleak picture of the future, with many [scientists
[envisioning]{.mark} widespread [**famines**, **conflicts**]{.mark},
mass **[migration]{.mark}**, and increasing extreme weather that will
[surpass **anything**]{.mark} **witnessed [thus far]{.mark}**[, posing
**catastrophi**]{.mark}**c consequences** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[**[humanity]{.mark}** and the **biosphere**]{.underline}
(Carrington 2024). It is important to keep in mind, however, that such
characterizations can suffer from conflation of matters of science
(i.e., how much warming are we committed to for a given emissions
pathway) and matters of policy (what pathways are still possible and
what the obstacles are). There is no way to know, for example, whether
the polled IPCC physical scientists based their assessments on the
science or simply on their views of the political prospects for action
(Mann and Hayhoe 2024).

One of the numerous challenges for scientists is how to communicate
about climate change (Guenther 2024). Some have argued that attitudes of
pessimism and resignation can be obstructive to climate action.
Moreover, some say those who oppose action have resorted to alternative
strategies including the propagation of pessimism, because embracing a
sense of helplessness can undermine the motivation for action (Mann and
Hayhoe 2024). Conversely, it has also been suggested that optimism gives
rise to inaction, if people think things are fine and therefore action
is not needed (Wilson 2021). In any case, the importance of tone may be
overstated in this context, and more research is needed to better
identify motivating factors for climate action (Bamberg et al. 2018).

[With]{.underline} the increasingly [**undeniable effects** of climate
change]{.underline}, a [**dire assessment** is an **honest assessment**.
[Denying]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[existential threat]{.mark}** posed
by climate change [is]{.mark}]{.underline} becoming [**increasingly
[less plausible]{.mark}**. The fact is]{.underline} that [avoiding
**[every tenth of a degree]{.mark} of warming** [is
**critical**]{.mark}**ly important**]{.underline}. Rather than
presenting a climate change prognosis pessimistically or optimistically,
we just want to act truthfully and tell it like it is. We must emphasize
both urgency and agency when it comes to our characterizations of the
needed action on climate (Mann 2023).

Climate change as a social justice issue

Climate change is a matter of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),
because the wealthy people that emit the most greenhouse gases are
generally less vulnerable to climate impacts (figure 5e). Although the
ramifications of emissions are global, they are particularly severe in
the Global South (Ngcamu 2023). [Vulnerability to climate change is
shaped by a complex interplay of social, economic, and political
factors, leaving historically diverse]{.underline}, underserved, [and
marginalized communities **disproportionately affected**]{.underline}
(Levy and Patz 2015). DEI principles underscore the urgency to address
these disparities. Embedding climate change within the framework of
organizational DEI activities may help to foster comprehensive and
meaningful progress toward equity and sustainability. By recognizing the
disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities,
organizations can work toward rectifying historical injustices by
funding countries in the Global South to maintain decarbonization while
addressing urgent climate change concerns. In addition, DEI
considerations are relevant to international climate policy; for
example, they can help guide efforts to rapidly and equitably phase out
fossil fuel extractions (Muttitt and Kartha 2020).

The ethical dimensions of climate change have led many faith leaders to
speak out on the issue (e.g., Nhat Hanh 2015, Pope Francis 2023). This
represents an opportunity for diverse communities to build alliances
around the issue.

Climate feedback loops and tipping points

Awareness and research need to increase on climate feedback loops.
Feedback loops are processes that can either amplify or reduce the
effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Many [**significant [feedback
loops]{.mark}** [enhance warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least
[**[28]{.mark}** amplifying feedback loops have been
[identified]{.mark}]{.underline} (tables 2a, 2b). A particularly
concerning feedback loop is the [**[permafrost]{.mark}** feedback
loop]{.underline}, which [involves rising temperatures causing
permafrost thawing]{.underline}. This process [releases more carbon
dioxide and methane, leading to **further warming**]{.underline}. Areas
of active climate feedback loop research include [permafrost--cloud
interactions]{.underline} (de Vrese et al. 2024), [[glacier
meltwater]{.underline}]{.mark} (Pelle et al. 2023), [and
**[biod]{.mark}**iversity]{.underline} (Weiskopf et al. 2024). Because
feedback loops are not yet fully integrated into climate models, current
emissions reduction plans might fall short in adequately limiting future
warming.

\<\<TABLE 2A, 2B OMITTED\>\>

Some climate feedback loops are linked to [**[tipping points]{.mark}**,
potentially [trigger]{.mark}ing major and **[irreversible
changes]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the [Earth system]{.underline} without
further pushing by human activities. Tipping elements are biophysical
systems on Earth with tipping point behavior that contribute to
regulating the climate system (Lenton et al. 2008). They have recently
been assessed for their tipping sensitivity. [**Five** of sixteen
climate tipping elements are likely to cross]{.underline} their tipping
points [at 1.5°C]{.underline}: the [**Greenland** ice
sheet]{.underline}, the [**West Antarctic** ice sheet, boreal
permafrost, low-latitude coral reefs, and]{.underline} the [Barents Sea
Ice]{.underline} (Armstrong McKay et al. 2022). Several climate [tipping
elements are connected]{.underline}, and [if [one]{.mark} tips, others
[may]{.mark} tip, **[trigger]{.mark}**ing a **[tipping point
cascade]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Wunderling et al. 2024). Overall, this
points to a complex situation where climate controlling feedback loops
and tipping point systems are interconnected in a way that could trigger
self-perpetuating processes that amplify warming beyond human control.
Therefore, we recommend the IPCC publish a special report on feedback
loops and tipping points.

Risk of societal collapse

The [**climate emergency** is not]{.underline} an
**[isolated]{.underline}** issue. [Global
**[heating]{.mark}**]{.underline}, although it [[is]{.mark}
**catastrophic**]{.underline}, is [merely [one aspect
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**profound [polycrisis]{.mark}** that
includes environmental degradation]{.underline}, rising [economic
**inequality**, and **biodiversity**]{.underline} loss (Hoyer
et al. 2023). Climate change is a glaring symptom of a deeper systemic
issue: ecological overshoot, where human consumption outpaces the
Earth\'s ability to regenerate (Rees 2023, Ripple et al. 2024).
Overshoot is an inherently unstable state that cannot persist
indefinitely. As pressures increase and the risk of Earth\'s climate
system switching to a catastrophic state rises (Steffen et al. 2018),
[**more and more scientists** have begun to research]{.underline} the
possibility of **[societal collapse]{.underline}** (Brozović 2023). Even
in the absence of global collapse, climate change could cause many
millions of additional deaths by 2050 (WHO 2023).

Along with the broader danger of overshoot, [**[climate]{.mark} change**
could contribute to]{.underline} a [collapse by
**[increas]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} the [[likelihood of
**catastrophi**]{.mark}**c risks** such as **international
[conflict]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} by causing **multiple stresses**,
resulting in **[system-wide]{.mark}**]{.underline} synchronous
[[failures]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kemp et al. 2022). The number of
published articles using climate change and societal collapse language
has been dramatically increasing (figure 5f; supplemental methods).
[Climate change has]{.underline} already displaced millions of people,
and has the [potential to displace **hundreds**]{.underline} of millions
or even billions more, [leading to greater **geopolitical
instability**]{.underline} (Table S3). By the end of the century,
roughly one-third of people worldwide could be outside the human climate
niche, facing increased risk of illness and early death, famine, and a
host of other adverse outcomes (Lenton et al. 2023).

https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/despite-leaders-call-u-s-china-relations-remain-stuck-in-neutral\]

After 135 days in office, U.S. President Donald Trump finally spoke with
China's President Xi Jinping. Besides exchanging pleasantries and
invitations for reciprocal visits, the two leaders pledged to renew
efforts to stabilize the turbulent relationship between the world's two
largest economies. [If the commitment for even a temporary truce is
genuine, [recalibration will be a daunting task]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
his TruthSocial post, President Trump said the two leaders exclusively
discussed trade issues, but the Chinese readout also mentioned sensitive
issues like Taiwan and the status of Chinese students in the United
States. The Chinese side also stressed that it is the U.S. that should
"remove the negative measures taken against China," while China has been
operating in a "sincere manner." Translation: China intends to dictate
the tone and tenor of future bilateral negotiations and thinks it has
the resources and negotiating leverage to secure an outcome largely
favorable to Beijing. As the old joke goes, "win-win cooperation" in
Chinese means that the Communist Party of China wins twice. Besides the
trade issues that precipitated the current crisis in bilateral
relations, [the **[divergence of views]{.mark}** on global security
matters **[has gone]{.mark}** from bad to **[worse]{.mark}** between
Beijing and Washington.]{.underline} In three years since Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine[, [Russia and China's
relationship]{.mark} has [solidified]{.mark} into a durable alliance,
[notwithstanding]{.mark} the nascent [U.S. efforts]{.mark} to engineer a
"reverse Kissinger,]{.underline}" or normalizing relations with Russia
to peel it away from China, akin to what President Richard Nixon and his
national security advisor Henry Kissinger did in the 1970's with China
to contain the Soviet Union. [[China's **threats to Taiwan**
have]{.mark} greatly [escalated]{.mark} since the January 2024 election
of autonomy-minded President Lai Ching-te. [**China continues to
militarize** the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea and
aggressively encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbors]{.underline},
especially the Philippines. In its annual worldwide threat assessment
released in March, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence warned
that [what was a [China problem has also now become]{.mark} a broader
problem: "[**Russia**, **China**, **Iran** and **No**]{.mark}rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea -- individually and collectively -- are challenging
U.S. interests in the world by attacking or threatening others in their
regions,]{.underline} with both asymmetric and conventional hard power
tactics, and promoting alternative systems to compete with the United
States, primarily in trade, finance, and security." [The so-called
[CRINK alliance]{.mark} is now the pre-eminent [authoritarian threat to
the U.S.]{.mark}-led global [order]{.mark}, and the U.S. has still not
fully developed a strategy to deal with the threat.]{.underline} The
Trump-Xi conversation is also hopefully the start of a serious process
to shape a long-term policy to meet the China Challenge, or the
formulation of a long-term plan to disrupt Beijing's plan for global
dominance and to ensure that the United States remains a leading global
power. [To do this, [the **administration needs to**]{.mark} develop and
pursue a multi-pronged effort focused on **[strengthen]{.mark}**ing

security]{.mark} defense base, [competing with China]{.mark}'s global
geostrategic initiatives in Africa and Latin America, [and leading
with]{.mark} our values of freedom and [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There is still much work to do to achieve these goals.

record-low new investment plans,\"

WASHINGTON \-- [[American companies in China]{.mark} are [reporting
record-low]{.mark} new investment plans for this year and declining
confidence in their profitability, with [uncertainty in U.S.-China
relations and President Donald Trump's tariffs]{.mark} their top
concerns, according to a survey released Wednesday.]{.underline}¶ The
companies are also challenged by China\'s slowing economy, where weak
domestic demand and overcapacity in local industries are eroding
profitability for the Americans.¶ "[[Businesses]{.mark} in China [are
less profitable]{.mark} now than they were years ago, but risks,
including reputational risk, regulatory risk, and political risk, are
increasing,"]{.underline} said Sean Stein, the president of the
U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group that represents
American companies doing business in China, including major
multinationals.¶ The survey, conducted between March and May and drawing
from 130 member companies, came as the two countries clash over tariffs
and non-tariff measures, including export controls on critical products
such as rare-earth magnets and advanced computer chips. Following
high-level talks in Geneva and London, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed
to pull back from sky-high tariffs and restrictions on exports, [but
[uncertainty persists]{.mark} as the two sides are yet to hammer out a
more permanent trade deal.]{.underline}¶ Kyle Sullivan, vice president
of business advisory services at the USCBC, said [[more than half
of]{.mark} the [companies]{.mark} in the survey indicated they [do not
have new]{.mark} investment [plans in China]{.mark} "at all" this
year.]{.underline}¶ \"That's a record high," Sullivan said, noting that
it is ""a new development that we have not observed in previous
surveys."¶ Around 40% of [companies reported [negative effects from U.S.
export control]{.mark} measures, with many experiencing [lost
sales]{.mark}, severed [customer relationships, and reputational
damage]{.mark} from being unreliable suppliers,]{.underline} according
to the survey. Citing national security, the U.S. government has banned
exports to China of high-tech products, such as the most advanced chips,
which could help boost China\'s military capabilities.¶ Stein argued
that export controls must be very carefully targeted, [because
[businesses from Europe or Japan]{.mark}, or local businesses in China
[would immediately fill]{.mark} the [void]{.mark} left by American
companies.]{.underline}¶ Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia won approval
from the Trump administration to resume sales to China of its advanced
H20 chips used to develop artificial intelligence, its CEO Jensen Huang
announced on Monday, though the company\'s most powerful chips remain
under U.S. export control rules.¶ While 82% of U.S. companies reported
profits in 2024, fewer than half are optimistic about the future in
China, reflecting concerns over tariffs, deflation, and policy
uncertainty, according to the survey.¶ Also[, a [record]{.mark}
[high]{.mark} number of American [businesses plan to relocate]{.mark}
their business operations outside of China,]{.underline} Sullivan said,
as 27% of the members indicated so, up from 19% the year before.¶ In a
departure from past surveys, concerns over China\'s regulatory
environment, including risks of intellectual property misuse and lack of
market access, didn't make it to the top five concerns this year.
That\'s likely a first, and not for a good reason, Stein said.¶ "[It is
not because things got dramatically better on the Chinese side, but the
new challenges, often coming from the U.S., are now posing as much of a
challenge,"]{.underline} Stein said.¶ Almost all the American companies
said they cannot remain globally competitive without their Chinese
operations.¶ A survey from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in
China in May found that European companies were cutting costs and
scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce
competition drives down prices.

#### Trump kills cooperation\-\--China is stepping back from the US now

**Shin 7/8** \[Kawashima; 7-8-2025; Shin Kawashima is the professor of
the Department of International Relations, the Graduate School of Arts &
Sciences, the University of Tokyo; The Diplomat, \"China-US Relations:
Looking for an Edge,\"
https://thediplomat.com/2025/07/china-us-relations-looking-for-an-edge/\]

The relationship with China that the Biden administration built was seen
as a competitive one: both parties sought to avoid conflict, encouraged
cooperation where it was needed, and emphasized communication to
maintain the relationship. That's why Secretary of State Antony Blinken
met frequently with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang
Yi. Communication is vital for deterrence, and both China and the U.S.
took a textbook approach. Climate change encouraged the two superpowers
to pursue cooperation.

[Under the Trump administration, this framework has collapsed. Climate
change is no longer an area of cooperation. Tariffs are now the main
point of dialogue, and certainly remain a major headache for China. When
the international environment deteriorates, China tends to look to
strengthen ties with Russia and other partner states, while building
closer relationships with its neighbors. Beijing has already taken steps
in this direction]{.underline}, holding the Central Conference on Work
Related to Neighboring Countries in April 2025.

Even before Trump returned to power, it was clear that he would make the
U.S. trade deficit with China an issue. It was also clear that his
foreign policy and national security team would take a hardline stance
on China in terms of economic security. Concerned about food and energy
security, [**China has worked to insulate itself from American
influence**, finding alternative soybean suppliers and stepping up
imports of Iranian crude oil. Just as many developed nations have
reduced their economic reliance on China**, China itself is working to
reduce its economic dependence on the U.S.**]{.underline}

Right now[, China's economic policy is focused on building an economic
structure centered on domestic demand.]{.underline} This differs sharply
from the "Reform and Opening Up" period, when there was a focus on
foreign trade. [As a result, the pressure from U.S. tariffs gives China
an opportunity to double down on an inwardly focused economic
model]{.underline}. There are, of course, sectors where trade with the
U.S. remains essential. However, for those sectors where it is not
vital, we can expect China to pursue a shift to domestic production or
to diversify its trade partners in ASEAN and Central Asia.

Faced with harsh tariffs, China has limited means to respond. Even if
wanted to buy American, Beijing's shift towards a focus on domestic
demand makes it less likely to be interested in boosting imports[. Even
with aircraft]{.underline}, to take one example, [China is already
stepping up its own production for domestic flights, making large-scale
imports from the U.S. undesirable.]{.underline} Likewise, [economic
security restrictions make it extremely difficult for Chinese companies
to invest in America,]{.underline} even if those companies wanted to
contribute to job creation in the U.S. As such, one of the only options
remaining for China is to impose its own retaliatory tariffs. Another
avenue is to use rare earth metals and lithium-ion batteries as
leverage, with the former being essential for the automotive industry
and a major weapon in tariff negotiations.

[China has meanwhile sought to portray the U.S. to the rest of the
world]{.underline} -- and the Global South in particular -- [as a
disruptor of the free trade system]{.underline}. At the same time, it
has worked to rally allies of the U.S. that have been hit with high
tariffs, calling on them to work with China to confront Washington over
tariffs.

Beijing has identified many elements within the Trump administration's
policies that it thinks are to its advantage. Tariffs are one example,
but there is also the effective dismantling of USAID, the elimination of
funding for Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Asia (RFA), and more.
Many USAID projects have been suspended, and there have been significant
repercussions and criticism from countries in the Pacific and Africa.
Although China is also dealing with many economic issues of its own and
cannot provide the same level of funding to these countries as it did in
the late 2010s, this still represents an opportunity. The decline of VOA
is particularly advantageous to China, which has long tried to expand
its discourse power on the global stage. RFA once actively reported on
human rights issues in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. It
goes without saying that China welcomes the suspension of these
activities. [In reality, the de facto dismantling of USAID appears to
affect not only developing countries but also the state of global
discourse. There are growing concerns that this will lead to a breakdown
in the mechanisms that fact-check disinformation.]{.underline}

Right now, [China appears to be in the process of assessing the Trump
administration's policies, looking for potential openings.]{.underline}
The rest of the world will watch with interest to see if Washington can
respond nimbly once China begins to pursue its own policies, exploiting
any weaknesses in the U.S. position.

#### Trade war cooks relations\-\--despite discussions no lasting progress

**Lawder 7/27** \[David; 7-27-2025; ; Reuters, \"US, China to resume
tariff talks in effort to extend truce,\"
https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-china-resume-tariff-talks-effort-extend-truce-2025-07-27/\]

STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet
in Stockholm on Monday to tackle longstanding economic disputes at the
centre of a trade war between the world\'s top two economies, aiming to
extend a truce keeping sharply higher tariffs at bay.¶ China is facing
an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with President
Donald Trump\'s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached a
preliminary deal in June to end [weeks of escalating tit-for-tat
tariffs]{.underline}.¶ Without an agreement, global supply chains could
face renewed turmoil from duties exceeding 100%.¶ The Stockholm talks,
led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He
Lifeng, come right on the heels of T[rump\'s biggest trade deal yet,
with the European Union accepting a 15% tariff on its goods exports to
the U.S.]{.underline} and agreeing to make significant EU purchases of
U.S. energy and military equipment.¶ That deal struck with European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday in Scotland also
calls for \$600 billion in investments in the U.S. by the EU, Trump told
reporters[.¶ **No similar breakthrough is expected in the U.S.-China
talks**,]{.underline} but trade analysts said that another 90-day
extension of a tariff and export control truce struck in mid-May was
likely.¶ An extension of that length would prevent further escalation
and help create conditions for a potential meeting between Trump and
Chinese President Xi Jinping in late October or early November.¶
Spokespersons for the White House and U.S. Trade Representative\'s
office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a South
China Morning Post report quoting unnamed sources as saying the two
sides would refrain from introducing new tariffs or take other steps
that could escalate the trade war for another 90 days[.¶ **Trump\'s**
administration **is poised to impose new** sectoral **tariffs** that
will impact China, including on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals,
ship-to-shore cranes and other products.¶]{.underline} \"We\'re very
close to a deal with China. We really sort of made a deal with China,
but we\'ll see how that goes,\" Trump told reporters before his meeting
with von der Leyen, providing no further details.¶ DEEPER ISSUES¶
Previous U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva and London in May and June
focused on bringing U.S. and Chinese retaliatory tariffs down from
triple-digit levels and restoring the flow of rare earth minerals halted
by China and Nvidia\'s (NVDA.O), opens new tab H20 AI chips and other
goods halted by the United States.¶ [So far, the talks have not delved
into broader economic issues]{.underline}. They [include U.S. complaints
that China\'s state-led, export-driven model is flooding world markets
with cheap goods, and Beijing\'s complaints that U.S. national security
export controls on tech goods seek to stunt Chinese
growth.]{.underline}¶ \"Stockholm will be the first meaningful round of
U.S.-China trade talks,\" said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at
China consultancy firm Plenum.¶ [Trump has been successful in pressuring
some other trading partners, including Japan, Vietnam and the
Philippines, into deals accepting higher U.S. tariffs of 15% to
20%]{.underline}.¶ Analysts say the U.S.-China negotiations are far more
complex and will require more time. [China\'s grip on the global market
for rare earth minerals and magnets, used in everything from military
hardware to car windshield wiper motors, has proved to be an effective
leverage point on U.S. industrie]{.underline}s.¶ TRUMP-XI MEETING?¶ In
the background of the talks is speculation about a possible meeting
between Trump and Xi in late October.¶ Trump has said he will decide
soon whether to visit China in a landmark trip to address trade and
security tensions. [A new flare-up of tariffs and export controls would
likely derail any plans for a meeting with Xi.]{.underline}¶ \"The
Stockholm meeting is an opportunity to start laying the groundwork for a
Trump visit to China,\" said Wendy Cutler, vice president at the Asia
Society Policy Institute[.¶ Bessent has already said he wants to work
out an extension of the August 12 deadline to prevent tariffs snapping
back to 145% on the U.S. side and 125% on the Chinese
side.]{.underline}¶ Still, China will likely request a reduction of
multi-layered U.S. tariffs totaling 55% on most goods and further easing
of U.S. high-tech export controls, analysts said. [Beijing has argued
that such purchases would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China,
which reached \$295.5 billion in 2024.¶]{.underline} China is currently

In May, the [**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Australia]{.mark}**
[signed a]{.mark}]{.underline} climate, [[critical minerals]{.mark} and
clean energy [transformation]{.mark} [compact]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
establishes a framework for **[collaborat]{.mark}**ion **[on]{.mark}**
climate issues, clean-energy technology and **[critical-mineral supply
chains]{.mark}.** It]{.underline} mainly [discusses critical
minerals]{.underline} in the context of their [necessity in
manufacturing]{.underline} clean-energy technologies.

The intent of the [framework is to 'coordinate policies and investments
to support]{.underline} the expansion and diversification of responsible
clean energy and [critical minerals supply chains']{.underline}. In this
case, [**[diversification]{.mark}**]{.underline} basically **[[equates
to reducing]{.mark} [dependence on China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in
which various links in the critical-mineral supply chain are heavily
concentrated. While the compact establishes a new ministerial dialogue,
the Forum on Clean Energy Industrial Transformation, and **[[an
Australia--US taskforce on critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
[**[most vital component of strengthening critical-mineral supply
chains]{.mark}** is investment in critical-mineral
projects]{.underline}.

The critical minerals industry often cites a lack of capital as a
barrier to stronger and more diverse supply chains. Mines are
capital-intensive projects that can cost tens of billions of dollars.
Therefore, any compact that seeks 'an unprecedented expansion' in
critical mineral supplies must provide capital for mines. The need for
government capital is further heightened given the lack of
private-sector funding for mining.

The compact commits to using 'domestic financial instruments and
incentives to foster greater integration of responsible clean energy
supply chains', which includes critical-mineral supply chains. [It also
says the [US and Australia]{.mark} will [seek industry input]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [financial incentives, and]{.mark} it lists the [US
Export--Import Bank]{.mark} [as a]{.mark} possible [financing
agency]{.mark}.]{.underline} Notably, in a joint statement with
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, US President Joe Biden said
that he would ask Congress to add Australia as a 'domestic source' under
Title III of the Defense Production Act, enabling Australian projects to
access significant US government funds.

Beyond those measures, the compact doesn't offer funding specifics---but
that was always going to come next, with industry input. To ensure the
compact's success, the US should consider a range of policies for
funding mines in Australia.

First, the [[US should fund Australian mines]{.mark} under the
compact]{.underline}, not refineries, [which it should invest in
domestically [to diversify the critical-mineral supply
chain]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mining is geographically constrained by the
location of mineral deposits, but refining is largely determined by
capital and regulations. For example, China has only 3% of global cobalt
reserves and produces just 1% of global cobalt ore, yet it controls 77%
of global cobalt refining capacity. Similarly, the [**[US could fund
enough refining capacity to satisfy domestic demand]{.mark}** even
without comparably large mineral reserves---**[especially with
Australia]{.mark}**]{.underline} on board. By [[funding Australian mines
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the minimum [[level of crude refining required
to economically ship critical minerals to the US to be
refined]{.underline}]{.mark}, the US could effectively diversify the
critical-mineral supply chain.

That said, the US should only fund Australian mines that produce
minerals that are lacking in the United States and Canada. US
critical-mineral supply chains are most secure when they are in or near
the US and under friendly control. US taxpayer dollars should not be
expended on distant mines when nearby mines are available and can meet
demand. Importantly, this provision could make the proposal for funding
Australian mines more palatable to Congress.

Second, the [[US should allow companies]{.mark} to partner in a
US-funded mine [only]{.mark} [if]{.mark} they are [not owned]{.mark} in
any way [by foreign entities]{.mark} of concern, [including all Chinese
entities]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[US should not fund
Australian]{.mark} [mines where Chinese entities can benefit financially
or influence]{.mark} the [project]{.mark} at the expense of US
taxpayers]{.underline}. To protect US national security, if an
Australian company is seeking to participate in a US-funded mine in
Australia, it should have to first divest any shares held by entities of
concern.

American companies should have a controlling interest in US-funded
mines, so that the [[US gov]{.mark}ernment [can enforce
compliance]{.mark} [with US regulations]{.mark}, such as blocking
Chinese companies' involvement or investment in the mine]{.underline}.
Partnering with experienced Australian partners will also enable less
experienced US companies to build valuable mining skills, effectuating
two of the compact's goals: 'to encourage stronger industrial
collaboration' and 'to support workforce development in critical
minerals'.

Lastly, the US should require that mined materials from Australia be
refined by American companies in the US because diversifying the
critical mineral supply chain is the primary reason for funding mines in
Australia. That requirement will grow the country's refining capacity
and downstream processing for applications like the production of alloys
for permanent magnets and cathode material for electric vehicle
batteries. The [[US]{.mark} should [also require]{.mark} that the [mined
material have an end use in a strategic US sector like]{.mark} aerospace
or [transportation]{.mark}]{.underline}, not consumer electronics like
televisions and mobile phones.

The [**[US]{.mark}** should [also **require all companies
participating** in the mine]{.mark} **[to stop operating in China and
selling their products to Chinese entities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nor
should the US allow companies to use earnings from a US-funded mine to
support their operations in China or sales to Chinese entities. The US
should not effectively subsidise companies that operate in China or sell
products to Chinese mineral companies, which are beholden to the Chinese
government.

The compact is a satisfactory starting framework for strengthening
critical-mineral supply chains between the US and Australia. How the two
countries deploy capital to mineral projects will determine the
compact's success, and US funding for mines in Australia could help
achieve the compact's goals. The stipulations attached to such an
arrangement would help to ensure that [[US--Australia supply chains are
diversified, protected from Chinese influence]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
forged by a workforce in both countries.

In exchange for its minerals, Australia would get investment and a
diversified supply chain, and in exchange for its capital, the US would
get access to those minerals and its own diversified supply chain. Such
an arrangement would serve the needs of both countries and help achieve
the compact's goal of promoting a 'responsible, sustainable, and stable
supply of critical minerals.'

The [[Australian resources minister]{.mark} was [saddened the US did not
accept an offer of guaranteed supply to critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline} in return for steel and aluminium tariff
exemptions and has warned the package will not be improved.

[[Australian diplomats proposed a more reliable supply of critical
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark} -- which are essential for renewable
energy, computer and battery technologies -- as they sought exemptions
from a 25% tax on steel and aluminium imports.

The offer was rejected by US officials and Australia was subjected to
the tariffs along with all other nations on Wednesday afternoon. This is
despite Malcolm Turnbull's government securing an exemption from similar
measures during Trump's first term in office.

The resources minister, Madeleine King, told Guardian Australia the
federal government would continue to campaign for an exemption to the
tariffs, but would not make a more favourable offer on critical
minerals.

"I don't see a world in which we revise any package," King said. "[What
[we have been talking to the Americans about]{.mark} for some time
\[[is]{.mark}\] the [supply of critical minerals into the American
system]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"It was always a continuation of that, perhaps a bit more focused on a
few things, but it was not a critical minerals at any cost proposition."

King said that while [[US investment in Australia's critical minerals
industry was being actively sought]{.underline}]{.mark}, there was
already established investment from Japan and South Korea and interest
from other nations.

"We have Germany and Europe that have set up multibillion-dollar funds
to invest in critical minerals around the world and we have been talking
to them for a while," King said.

"While [[we would always welcome investment from
America]{.underline}]{.mark}, we of course have other options."

King said the offer to America was "absolutely not" a
take-it-or-leave-it proposal and that negotiations would continue.

"I'm sad in as much as I think it is a great opportunity," King said.
"But we have been working on this opportunity for some time, as had
previous governments. We always want things to move more quickly than
they do."

The US is seeking to boost its access to critical minerals to address
China's dominance of the supply chain. China reportedly controls about
60% of production and 85% of processing capabilities.

[[Australia is the third-largest holder of lithium reserves]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [has sizeable deposits of]{.mark} cobalt and other [rare

The new reality dawning in Australia: it can no longer rely on the US

The Trump administration has sought a deal with Ukraine for access to
its critical mineral resources and openly canvassed taking control of
Greenland, which contains vast and untapped mineral deposits.

On Friday, the Nationals MP Kevin Hogan supported the government's use
of critical minerals as a bargaining tool during negotiations with US
officials.

"[[We have]{.mark} some [great critical minerals that are very
important]{.mark} to them, [especially some that they can't

But [[Australia also mines rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
country, [[rich in minerals]{.mark}, is also advanced in energy
technology]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} [leads the world in green
electricity supplied]{.mark} by wind and solar and battery
storage]{.underline}. Since 2023, one state, South Australia, has been
operating its grid with 72% supplied by renewables, and just last week
announced an uptick in the supply that should help it reach its goal of
100% by 2027. Integral to this is Australia's development of grid-scale
battery storage systems (BESS) that were invented down under by Elon
Musk in 2016, and shown to stabilize the intermittent supply of
electricity.

Recently, the government of Australia has appointed sizeable funding
that includes mining and processing of rare earths. [The overt
[goal]{.mark} is [to]{.mark} shore up Australia's security, but also
with an eye to [helping the U.S. which is kind of stuck because of the
trade impasse with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Let's look further into
this.

What Are Rare Earths?

Rare earths are 17 elements at the upper end of the Periodic Table. They
have funny names like yttrium, neodymium, and europium. They exist in
lots of places around the world, but are very difficult to process to
purity. Why are they important? Rare earths are used to make the best
magnets used in phones, EV motors, wind turbines, and jet engines. TV
and computer screens with rare earths show colors better. They are also
key to advanced technologies in the medical field (MRI and laser
surgery), as well as defense systems.

China Dominates In Rare Earths

Resources for rare earths usually contain radioactive elements, and this
is why few countries have mines and even fewer will process the
principal mining ore. Europe steered away from rare earth mines because
of radioactive waste.

But China embraced rare earths after Deng Xiaoping famously stated in
1992: "The Middle East has oil, and China has rare earths". China then
began to focus on rare earth mining and processing using cheaper labor
costs and lower environmental restrictions. According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA), China produces 61% and processes 92%
of the world's rare earths. It's easy to see that China controls the
supply chain, and this is what concerns the west.

The Politics Of Rare Earths

Because of Trump's tariffs, China retaliated on April 4 by placing
restrictions on exports of seven rare earths, the heavy rare earths.
This is a big deal because the U.S. imported 70% of rare earths from
China between 2020 and 2023. So last week, Trump wrote an order that the
commerce department find ways to produce rare earths in the U.S. and not
have to rely on imports from countries like China.

Meanwhile, prices of rare earths will surge in the U.S., and companies
that make electronics (smartphones) and defense (missiles, radar and jet
fighters) will be hurt. The order quoted, "Critical minerals, including
rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic
resilience."

One simple truth makes this clear. An American F35 supersonic strike
fighter jet uses 420 kilograms of heavy rare earths in making the plane.

Sadly, the U.S. is holding a poor hand in regard to rare earths. The
country has only one mine that is operating, and no capacity to process
the minerals---instead they are/were sent to China for processing.
Second, the ensuing trade war means the U.S. may now be restricted in
its imports of rare earths from China. Third, the U.S. has alienated
many other friendly nations by laying on tariffs, while some of these
might have agreed to export processed rare earths to the U.S.

All this helps to understand President Trump's ideas about exploiting
Ukraine and Greenland for rare earths, even though the latest map does
reveal five separate locations in Ukraine where rare earths are found.
The problem is, production in such enterprises would presumably be
starting from square one.

[[Can Australia Save U.S. Rare Earths]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[prime minister of Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}, Anthony
Albanese, has recently [[pledged A \$1.2 billion to build a strategic
reserve for critical minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}, if he wins the
national election to be held next month. [The [reserve]{.mark} would
[contain critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt, top producers in
Australia]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} would [also]{.mark} include [rare
earths]{.mark}]{.underline}. Albanese said the [key would be minerals
that are [vital]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the country's [security]{.mark},

Australia\'s Critical Minerals Strategy

[[Australia maintains]{.mark} a comprehensive list of [31 critical
minerals essential]{.mark} [to]{.mark} modern [technologies]{.mark},
economies, [and national security]{.mark}]{.underline}. This strategic
approach considers three key factors: geological potential within
Australia, demand from strategic international partners, and
vulnerability to supply chain disruption.

Key materials on [[Australia\'s critical minerals list
include]{.underline}]{.mark} high-purity alumina, antimony, gallium,
graphite, indium, lithium, manganese, nickel, [rare earth elements
([REEs]{.mark}]{.underline}), tungsten, and vanadium. Each of these
plays a crucial role in defence applications, from aerospace components
to electronic systems.

Australia\'s strategy recognizes that these minerals represent not just
national security assets but also significant economic opportunities in
a world increasingly concerned about secure supply chains.

Why Are Defence-Critical Materials Important to Australia?

National Security Considerations

Global supply chains for defence-critical materials face unprecedented
vulnerabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. China currently
controls the lion\'s share of global processing capacity for many
defence-critical materials, creating a strategic vulnerability for
Western nations including Australia.

Between 2019 and 2024, China invested approximately US\$34 billion in
mining-related foreign direct investment projects worldwide,
consolidating its dominance in critical mineral supply chains. This
market concentration has raised serious concerns among defence planners
in Australia and allied nations.

The strategic imperative to secure these resources has intensified as
military technologies become increasingly sophisticated and
mineral-dependent. For Australia, developing domestic supply chains
represents both a national security imperative and a strategic advantage
in alliance relationships.

Western nations, including [[Australia]{.mark}, are actively
[implementing policies to reduce dependency on Chinese supply]{.mark}
chains for these vital materials.]{.underline} This shift creates both
challenges and opportunities for Australia\'s mining sector and cse
industry.

Economic Opportunities

Victoria\'s defence industry alone generates more than \$8.4 billion
annually and employs 24,000 people, highlighting the economic
significance of this sector. The development of defence-critical
materials represents a major growth opportunity within this ecosystem.

The Australian Government has introduced the Critical Minerals
Production Tax Incentive (CMPTI), which provides a 10% tax benefit on
relevant processing and refining costs. [This incentive aims to
stimulate investment in an industry seen as crucial for both economic
and security reasons.]{.underline}

[[Australia\'s geological potential]{.mark} [for]{.mark} many
[defence-critical materials]{.mark} [creates]{.mark} significant [export
opportunities,]{.mark} particularly [as allied nations seek]{.mark}
trusted [suppliers outside of Chinese control]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Market analysts project that demand for some defence-critical minerals
could increase by 400-600% over the next two decades as defence
technologies advance.

Avalon 2025, the largest aerospace and defence expo in the Southern
Hemisphere, showcases Australia\'s growing capabilities in this sector.
The event highlights the [integration between mining, processing, and
defence manufacturing that makes Australia uniquely positioned in the
critical minerals space.]{.underline}

Rare Earth Elements: The Foundation of se Technology

Strategic Applications of REEs

Rare earth elements include 17 elements with unique catalytic,
metallurgical, nuclear, electrical, magnetic, and luminescent properties
that make them irreplaceable in advanced cse systems. Despite their
name, REEs are relatively abundant in the Earth\'s crust, but
economically viable concentrations are rare.

Global demand for magnet REEs nearly doubled between 2015 and 2023 and
industry projections suggest it could double again by 2050. Defence
applications represent a significant and growing portion of this demand,
particularly for heavy rare earth elements.

REEs are essential components in precision-guided munitions, lasers,
radar systems, electronic warfare equipment, electric vehicles,
batteries, and advanced electrical systems. The unique properties of
elements like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium make them
crucial for high-performance permanent magnets used in defene
applications.

Heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) like dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium
are particularly crucial for defence applications due to their unique
properties that enable technology miniaturization and performance in
extreme conditions. These elements often face the most severe supply
constraints.c

Australian REE Projects

Critica\'s Jupiter Project represents one of Australia\'s most promising
rare earth developments, with an inferred resource of 1.8 billion tonnes
at 1,700ppm total rare earth oxide (TREO). The project\'s scale
positions it as potentially globally significant for securing REE supply
chains.

Victory Metals\' North Stanmore Project demonstrates the economic
viability of Australian REE development, with projections indicating a
31-year mine life, post-tax NPV of \$1.212 billion, and internal rate of
return (IRR) of 52%. These economics highlight the potential for
Australia to develop commercially viable REE production.

ABx is developing production capabilities for mixed rare earth carbonate
(MREC) with a distinctive focus on concentrations enriched in dysprosium
and terbium---two of the most strategically valuable heavy rare earths
for defence applications. This specialized approach targets the
highest-value segment of the market.

American Rare Earths\' Halleck Creek Project demonstrates the
scalability potential in the sector, with an NPV10 of US\$558 million
that could potentially scale to US\$1.171 billion with expanded
production. The project highlights how initial developments can grow to
meet increasing demand.

Ragnar Metals is exploring REE prospects in Sweden, a country ranked in
the top 10 of the Fraser Institute\'s Annual Survey of Mining Investment
Attractiveness. This international approach demonstrates how Australian
companies are securing global rare earth reserves for these critical
materials.

How Is Australia Addressing Manganese Supply?

Manganese\'s Role in Defence

Manganese stands as one of NATO\'s 12 officially designated
defence-critical raw materials, highlighting its strategic importance to
Western military capabilities. This often-overlooked mineral plays a
crucial role in both structural applications and advanced battery
technologies.

China currently dominates the global high purity manganese sulphate
(HPMSM) supply chain, controlling approximately 93% of production. This
market concentration represents a significant strategic vulnerability
that Australia is uniquely positioned to address.

Manganese is essential for both traditional defence applications in
steel alloys and emerging technologies like advanced batteries. Its
dual-use nature makes it particularly valuable as defence systems
increasingly rely on high-performance energy storage.

Diversification of manganese supply represents a strategic priority for
Western nations, with Australia\'s high-grade deposits offering a
geopolitically secure alternative to Chinese dominance. Industry
analysts note that securing manganese supply chains has become a top
priority for defence departments worldwide.

Australian Manganese Projects

Black Canyon has completed successful benchtop scale beneficiation
testwork on samples from the W2 prospect at its Wandanya Project in
Western Australia. Initial results indicate potential for producing
battery-grade manganese from these deposits with competitive production
costs.

Firebird Metals achieved a significant milestone with the granting of a
mining lease for its Oakover Project, moving the company toward
establishing low-cost manganese-based cathode material operations. The
project\'s advancement represents a concrete step toward secured supply
chains.

Firebird aims to secure a natural cost advantage in
lithium-manganese-iron-phosphate (LMFP) cathode production, a technology
with significant ce applications. Industry analysts note that LMFP
cathodes could reduce battery costs by up to 30% while maintaining
performance requirements for military applications.

What Other Critical Minerals Is Australia Developing?

Tungsten: High Heat Resistance

China controls approximately 85% of global tungsten supply, creating a
strategic vulnerability for defence manufacturers requiring this vital
metal. Tungsten\'s unique properties make it essentially irreplaceable
in many defence applications.

As one of five refractory metals, tungsten exhibits extremely high
resistance to heat and wear, with the highest melting point of any metal
(3,422°C). This property makes it crucial for aerospace applications,
armor-piercing ammunition, and radiation shielding.

Group 6 Metals is progressing the Dolphin Tungsten Mine in Tasmania,
touted as the Western world\'s highest-grade tungsten deposit. With an
average grade of 0.95% WO₃, the project represents a rare
high-concentration resource outside Chinese control.

The Dolphin mine\'s history spans over 120 years, having operated
intermittently until the 1990s when Chinese production dominance forced
its closure. Its revival represents a strategic pivot toward secure
supply chains rather than merely economic considerations.

Titanium: Aerospace Applications

Titanium\'s unique combination of strength, lightweight properties, and
corrosion resistance makes it irreplaceable in aerospace applications,
medical technology, and high-performance military equipment. The
metal\'s strategic importance continues to grow as advanced defence
systems require increasingly specialized materials.

McLaren Minerals is leveraging its recently acquired sulphate ilmenite
project in Western Australia to address titanium supply chain
vulnerabilities. The company\'s 6,000-meter aircore drilling program at
the McLaren Titanium Project represents a significant exploration
investment.

McLaren\'s strategic transition from silica sands to heavy mineral sands
specifically targeting titanium minerals demonstrates how Australian
companies are pivoting toward defence-critical materials in Australia.
Industry experts note that titanium\'s aerospace applications make it
particularly valuable in the current geopolitical environment.

Gallium: Advanced Electronics

Gallium is essential for advanced radar systems, missile guidance, and
electronic warfare capabilities due to its unique semiconductor
properties. Its role in gallium nitride (GaN) technology represents one
of the most significant advances in defence electronics of the past
decade.

China\'s near-monopoly position, accounting for more than 98% of global
gallium production, creates an acute strategic vulnerability. Export
restrictions imposed by China in 2024 have already disrupted Western
defence manufacturing, highlighting the urgency of supply
diversification.

Victory Metals has demonstrated the potential for integrated production
by successfully extracting gallium in its final mixed rare earth
carbonate product from its North Stanmore project. This approach to
co-production could significantly improve project economics while
addressing critical supply gaps.

How Is Australia Supporting Critical Minerals Development?

Government Initiatives

The Australian Government introduced landmark legislation in November
2024 providing tax incentives specifically targeting critical minerals
production. This policy shift recognizes the strategic rather than
purely economic value of these resources.

The Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive (CMPTI) offers 10% of
relevant processing and refining costs as a tax benefit, directly
addressing the economic challenges of establishing sovereign capability
in these sectors. This approach has been praised by industry analysts as
a model for other Western nations.

Western Australia led a delegation of 34 local SMEs across defence,
aviation, aerospace, and space markets at Avalon 2025, demonstrating the
integration between mining and defence industries. The cross-sector
approach highlights Australia\'s whole-of-government strategy toward
critical minerals.

The Victorian Government has implemented targeted policies backing the
defence industry through its Economic Growth Statement, creating an
ecosystem where critical minerals development connects directly to
manufacturing capabilities. This integrated approach provides advantages
over competitors focusing solely on extraction.

Industry Collaboration

Avalon 2025 provided vital opportunities for Australia\'s defence
businesses to connect with global industry leaders and showcase domestic
capabilities. The event highlighted the growing integration between
critical minerals and ce manufacturing sectors.

[[Companies]{.mark} like Wedgetail Aerospace and Innovaero
[showcased]{.mark} defence drone [tech]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} remote
[piloted aircraft systems that rely heavily on critical
minerals]{.mark}, demonstrating the end-use applications driving demand
growth. This connection between mining and final defence applications
creates value chain opportunities.]{.underline}

Junior [exploration companies are increasingly focusing their efforts
specifically on defence-critical materials]{.underline}, adjusting
exploration priorities to align with national security requirements
rather than traditional market forces alone. This strategic pivot
represents a significant shift in the industry\'s approach.

Strategic partnerships across technology, defence, and energy sectors
are being developed with unprecedented speed, creating integrated supply
chains from mine to military application. Industry experts note that
these collaborative models represent a new paradigm in critical minerals
grant programs and development.

FAQs About Defence-Critical Materials in Australia

What makes a mineral \"defence-critical\"?

Defence-critical materials are essential for manufacturing advanced
military hardware and technology. NATO has identified 12 key materials
that form the backbone of military equipment, including jet engines,
missile guidance systems, and electronic warfare capabilities. The
designation considers both technical necessity and supply vulnerability.

Why is China\'s dominance in critical minerals concerning?

China controls the majority of global processing capacity for many
defence-critical materials, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for
Western nations. Between 2019 and 2024, China invested approximately
US\$34 billion in mining-related foreign direct investment projects to
secure access to critical minerals. This concentration creates both
economic leverage and potential security vulnerabilities during
conflicts.

What tax incentives does Australia offer for critical minerals
production?

In November 2024, the Australian Government introduced the Critical
Minerals Production Tax Incentive (CMPTI), which provides a 10% tax
benefit on relevant processing and refining costs for the nation\'s list
of 31 critical minerals. This incentive specifically targets the
processing and refining stages where China currently dominates global
capacity.

Which rare earth elements are most valuable for defence applications?

Heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) like dysprosium, terbium, and yttrium
are particularly valuable for defence applications due to their use in
high-performance magnets, lasers, and aerospace components. These
elements often command prices 5-10 times higher than light rare earths
due to their scarcity and strategic importance.

How significant is Australia\'s rare earth element potential?

[[Australia has at least 4% of global REE reserves and is positioned to
capitalize on the growing market]{.mark}.]{.underline} Companies like
Critica, Victory Metals, ABx, and American Rare Earths are [developing
significant REE projects with billion-dollar potential]{.underline}.
[[Australia\'s combination of geological endowment, processing

The plan aims at establishing a Critical Minerals Strategic Reserve,
which Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) chief
executive officer Warren Pearce said could strengthen Australia's
position as a reliable supplier to the world, including the United
States.

"Make no mistake. [[Australia is]{.mark} a [critical minerals
powerhouse]{.mark}. We [can be]{.mark} the reli[able supplier of
critical minerals to]{.mark} the world, including the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates," Pearce said.]{.underline}

"Indeed, the fact that President Trump has excluded a raft of critical
minerals in the tariff crackdown today, shows that Australia has a
strong hand to play.

Benchmark analysis reveals that even if all announced United States
projects proceed as planned, the US will still struggle to meet its
demand for key battery metals.

Lithium stands out as one of the few minerals where the US has
significant potential, but even then, domestic production is only
forecast to meet 67 per cent of its battery demand by 2030.

This gap presents a major opportunity for Australia, the world's leading
lithium producer.

[[With demand for]{.mark} lithium-ion batteries soaring due to the
electric vehicle (EV) revolution and [renewable energy storage]{.mark},
[Australia]{.mark} [is in]{.mark} a [prime position to
strengthen]{.mark} its [role]{.mark} [as a key supplier]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the [US market]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Australia has]{.mark} abundant lithium reserves and [a
well-established mining sector]{.mark}]{.underline} boasting lithium
giants such as Pilbara Minerals.

Pilbara Minerals (PLS), which successfully unlocked one of Australia's
largest and most prospective lithium fields, has become a global
company.

The company achieved first ore at its P1000 project at the Pilgangoora
operation on-time, while reporting record production and sales volumes
from the mine.

Once the P1000 project is commissioned and ramped up, its production of
spodumene concentrate will increase to one million tonnes per annum.

"[This reinforces the exceptional scale and quality of our Pilgangoora
project, which is one of the few hard rock lithium production operations
globally that has both the resource size and an existing operating
platform to enable a rapid scale-up of production,"]{.underline} PLS
chief executive officer Dale Henderson said.

"From the outset, our long-term growth strategy has been to develop each
stage with a focus on tailoring production to meet demand, while also
planning for future expansion opportunities.

"The P1000 project increases our nameplate production capacity by
approximately 47 per cent, driven by continued strong demand for our
product, and leverages the planning and ongoing work being undertaken as
part of the current P680 expansion project."

[By [securing]{.mark} stronger trade [partnerships]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
the [US]{.mark}, Australian producers can en[sure stable supply chains
while benefiting from]{.mark} rising lithium prices and [increasing
foreign investment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

the weekend when ambassador Kevin Rudd met US Commerce Secretary Howard
Lutnick and sought an exemption from the metals tariffs.

Trump will accept his renewed request for a phone call. Colin Murty

"We spent the weekend putting it all together because we thought that
was what they wanted," said the government source, who was not
authorised to speak publicly. "It wasn't sufficient to persuade them."

When Trump hit all imports of steel and aluminium with a 25 per cent
tariff on Wednesday, and refused to [exempt Australia, Prime Minister
Anthony Albanese revealed that his government had "put forward a range
of propositions"]{.underline} to the US, but he declined to elaborate.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong later confirmed that this had involved
"America gaining more secure domestic supply arrangements" for critical
minerals.

While Australia has been working with like-minded partners, including
the US, for several years on critical mineral partnerships, [[progress
with the US has been glacial.]{.underline}]{.mark}

As part of the tariff talks, a source said a specific proposition put to
the Americans was about an offtake agreement that would guarantee the US
a reliable supply, free from sovereign risk and other volatility.

Guaranteed supply

It was likened to a memorandum of understanding signed between Australia
and the European Union in May last year. In return for investment to
fund the processing of the minerals -- which are expensive and difficult
to extract -- this offered a guaranteed supply.

Trump has been strong-arming Ukraine for a critical minerals deal in
return for brokering a peace pact with Russia, complete with a security
guarantee. He has also made noises about buying Greenland, which has a
rich supply of such minerals. The former is war-torn, and the other is
environmentally and geographically hostile.

Resources Minister Madeleine King declined to divulge details but made
the point about the attractiveness of dealing with Australia.

"On any objective measure, Australia is the most attractive destination
for investment in critical minerals, given our extraordinary geological
endowment, world-leading resources sector and strong governance," she
said.

"We are working with trading partners, including the US and others to
co-operate and strengthen supply chains and attract investment. The door
is always open to US investment."

Albanese is yet to learn if Trump will accept his renewed request for a
phone call. Trump refused a similar request made in the days leading up
to the steel and aluminium decision.

The sources said the [[critical minerals]{.mark} offer would remain a
[key part of negotiations]{.mark}, [but Australia had given up]{.mark}
on steel and aluminium. The [focus]{.mark} was now [on avoiding
tariffs]{.mark} on agricultural products and pharmaceuticals, which
could be hit in a second wave in April.]{.underline}

Trade Minister Don Farrell has a scheduled phone call with US Trade
Representative Jamieson Greer on Sunday.

Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton continued their war of words
after the latter contrasted Labor's failure to secure tariff exemptions
with Malcolm Turnbull's success in 2018 when he had Trump spare
Australian aluminium and steel.

"If we have a situation where there are more tariffs applied to
different commodities -- to beef or whatever it might be -- then that
will be a disaster for our country, and I think the prime minister has a
responsibility to develop the relationships, to have an ambassador who
can open doors, and that just hasn't happened," Dutton said.

[[Albanese accused Dutton]{.underline}]{.mark} of "undermining
Australia's national interest".

powerhouse,"<https://www.economist.com/asia/2024/08/29/why-australia-is-not-yet-a-critical-minerals-powerhouse>
\] EK

But [[Australia]{.mark} is [struggling]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [get]{.mark}
its [critical minerals out of the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. A string
of its lithium and nickel mines have closed this year. Refineries are
also in trouble. In July BHP, a mining giant, said it would close its
nickel-processing facilities in Western Australia. Weeks later,
Albemarle, an American company, announced it was scaling back a lithium
refinery. Ostensibly the problem is a market crash. Demand for electric
vehicles, which use these minerals, is weaker than expected. And
supplies of minerals have soared, driving down prices.

Australian miners see a bigger hand at work. [China produces more than
half the world's rare earths and refines almost all of them. It
subsidises rare-earth companies. Where it lacks its own big critical
mineral deposits,]{.underline} it has invested abroad---including in the
Indonesian nickel that is flooding the market. It buys and refines the
lion's share of lithium. This lets China force down prices, says John
Coyne of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

[[Australia's rare-earth miners are dangerously
exposed]{.underline}]{.mark}, complains Tom O'Leary, chief executive of
Iluka Resources, one such group. In 2022 China issued a directive for
its producers to "guide product prices to return to rationality".
Rare-earth prices have since plunged by more than two-thirds. This makes
it hard for competitors to be profitable, says Mr O'Leary.

Chinese investors are also accused of using shady methods to secure
access to Australian supply chains. Last year Australia's government
barred a Chinese-linked fund from increasing its stake in Northern
Minerals, a miner, on national-security grounds. Shares were
subsequently purchased by several other funds. After an investigation,
the government determined that they were linked to China and ordered
them to divest their holdings in June.

For Australia, it is not just the potential for lucrative mines at home
that China's dominance severely threatens. It's also about its own
security of supply. China cut off rare-earth exports to Japan during a
diplomatic dispute in 2010, and curbed exports of gallium and germanium,
used in semiconductors, last year. Western countries face "an
existential risk around security of supply", says Mr O'Leary.

So far, Australia's answer is to support miners with cheap loans and
grants. It promises them tax breaks under a new industrial policy. But
the help only goes so far. The government lent Iluka A\$1.25bn (\$850m)
in 2022 to open a rare-earths refinery. On August 21st Iluka declared
that it needs more funding to complete the facility. [There is [still a
long way to go]{.mark} [to]{.mark} end, or [even reduce, reliance on
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\]

On Sunday August 7 1994, [[an explosion]{.mark} [at]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
Moura No 2 underground coal [mine in Queensland led to]{.mark} the
[deaths]{.mark} [of]{.mark} 11 [miners]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
tragedy was the catalyst for a major shakeup in the approach to safety
in all kinds of mines around Australia over the late 1990s and early
2000s.

Since that time, we have seen major improvements in safety performance.
In 2003, there were 12.4 fatalities per 100,000 workers; a decade later
the figure was down to 3.4.

However, [[since then progress has slowed if not
stalled]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite the industry's adoption of risk
management systems, competency training, and a shift away from
prescriptive regulation in the years following Moura, [the ra[te of
deaths and serious injuries has barely changed]{.mark} over the past
decade.]{.underline}

Given the huge size and variety of Australia's mining industry, and [the
inherent dangers of the work, w[e may never reach a time when there are
no deaths]{.mark}.]{.underline} But zero fatalities must still be the
goal.

A rise in 'one-off' incidents

In the past, most deaths were due to what are called "principal
hazards". These are [major inci[dents such as fires, explosions and mine
flooding]{.mark} that can [kill or injure many
people]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Most safety work has, for good reason, focused on these hazards, and by
my count they are today involved in fewer than 20% of deaths. What this
means is that today's tragedy landscape is more diffuse, with fatalities
scattered across a range of different scenarios.

Now, most deaths are the result of "one-off" events such as being struck
by objects, caught in machinery, falling from heights, or vehicle
collisions. Addressing all these possibilities is more complex.

Mental health, fatigue, staff turnover

Human factors also loom large. Despite a huge increase in mine
automation and remote operation technologies that reduce workers'
exposure to hazards, [there [are indications of worsening mental health,
rising fatigue and high staff turnover,]{.mark} which can erode
corporate knowledge.]{.underline}

Psychological and social problems such as [[these affect]{.mark} an
[estimated 20% of the modern mining workforce]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although there are fewer workers on site, they are often under huge
production pressures and the rosters can be very tough on family life.

Poor mental health can compromise decision-making and reduce vigilance,
leading to safety problems.

Slow, steady improvement

There are some promising developments. The "critical control management"
approach already adopted by Rio Tinto and Newmont, among others, has
been highly effective. This is a method that identifies a relatively
small number of vital controls that can prevent serious incidents, and
directs resources towards rigorously designing, implementing and
maintaining them.

We are also likely to see future safety gains from better equipment
design, further advances in automation and remote operation, and mental
health initiatives, such as Western Australia's Mental Awareness,
Respect and Safety program.

But in an industry that has still averaged eight fatalities per year
over the past decade, more [[safety reform is overdue]{.mark}. While new
technologies and initiatives may be helpful, [no]{.mark}ne will be a
["silver bullet]{.mark}".]{.underline}

[[Queensland]{.mark} alone has [staged three "safety resets" in]{.mark}
the [past five years]{.mark}, [with little result]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Real safety improvement will be slow and steady, and will come from
diligently and consistently applying proven safety management
techniques.

demand for permanent magnets. However, China is the main supplier of
world rare earth demands and has tried to impose restrictions on their

Several years ago, I wrote about "[[rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}"

warned (and stock speculators hyped) that China's near-monopoly on
supermagnet rare-earth elements could make the growing global shift to
electric cars and wind turbines impossible---because their motors and
generators, respectively, supposedly required supermagnets and hence
rare earths. But that's nonsense.

In the four years since that *Bulletin *article, one of the [[key

[supermagnets [using no rare earths]{.mark} but [with]{.mark} comparable

that permanent-magnet motors and generators do can also be done as well
or better using two other [[innovations that require **no rare earth

Both kinds of magnet-free machines can do everything required not only
in electric cars but also in wind turbines---functions often claimed to

It's better not to, and the word is spreading. Tesla's car business was

small magnets. But most commentators on "blood minerals" are not experts

The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and
deforestation, has led to global warming, rising sea levels, extreme
weather events, and a multitude of ecological disruptions. [The urgency

In recent years, [[nanotech]{.mark}nology has emerged as a promising
field that [holds the potential to revolutionise]{.mark} the way we
combat the growing issue.]{.underline}

Nanotechnology involves manipulating matter at the nanoscale, where
materials exhibit unique properties that can be harnessed for various
applications.

So, how can this be deployed in the fight against climate change? One of
the most significant contributions of nanotechnology to climate change
mitigation lies in clean energy production. [[Nanoscale]{.mark}
materials and [structures can]{.mark} significantly [enhance the
**efficiency** of renewable]{.mark} energy [technologies]{.mark} such as
**solar cells** and fuel cells.]{.underline}

In 2009, Broadband Solar, a startup spun out of Stanford University,
started developing coatings that increase the amount of light solar
cells can absorb, increasing their efficiency.

[[The tech]{.mark}nology [can also facilitate the production of
**cost-effective**]{.mark}]{.underline} and efficient [[hydrogen fuel

A report by Research and Markets claims nanotechnology in energy
applications is valued at \$9.3 billion and is set to grow at a CAGR of
15% by 2028.

The report adds: "Key drivers for the growth of the market for
nanotechnology in energy applications over the forecast period are the
strong shift in trend toward energy security applications of
nanotechnology in fuel cells and developing transport infrastructure.
["[Nanomaterials offer]{.mark} opportunities [for **mitigating**

Additionally, [nanotechnology offers innovative [solutions for capturing

processes and power plants.]{.underline}

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Functionalised nanomaterials can selectively capture CO2, providing a
potential pathway for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major
sources. It can also aid in the development of advanced materials for
carbon storage, ensuring that captured CO2 is safely stored and does not
re-enter the atmosphere. Climate change poses significant challenges to
agriculture, impacting food production and security. Nanoscale delivery
systems for fertilizers and pesticides can enhance nutrient uptake and
reduce the amount of chemicals released into the environment. Sensors
using the technology can also monitor soil health and optimise

tenth most common element in Earth\'s crust (Wedepohl, 1995). The annual
societal carbon turnover includes almost 10 000 million metric tonnes in
the form of coal, petroleum and natural gas (U.S. Energy Information
Administration, 2012) and about 2000 million metric tonnes of biogenic
carbon harvested in forests and on agricultural land (Berndes, 2014).
These numbers exceed the production volume of iron, the most common
industrial metal (1200 million metric tonnes of pig iron were produced
in 2015 (Fenton, 2016)), and are vastly greater than the turnover of any
scarce metal (see e.g. Table 1). [Recent years\' [r]{.mark}esearch [and

of carbon far beyond those of the traditional allotropes graphite and
diamond, mainly [[by the **discoveries** of carbon nanomaterials]{.mark}
(**CNMs**).]{.underline} The most commonly mentioned ones are
fullerenes, carbon nanotubes and graphene, but there are also others
that are being researched, such as graphyne, graphdiyne, graphone,
graphane (Peng et al., 2014) and carbon quantum dots (Shen and Liu,
2016). [Some [CNMs have **properties** similar to those of

**dispersed** in other materials,]{.mark} such as polymers, whereby the

argument can also be made that the legal bans on biological and chemical
weapons extend to nanomaterials with novel properties that affect life
processes in ways analogous to known toxic chemicals and pathogens.40It
has also been argued that using nanoparticles whose physical properties
or accumulation in the human body injure at the cellular level without
biochemical action, or nanorobots that are programmed to do this, may
fall foul of the prohibition in international humanitarian-an law (IHL)
on the use of poison and poisoned weapons.41

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED\>\>

Furthermore, questions have been raised as to whether nanomaterials that
are not readily detectable or removable from human tissue are compatible
with the letter and spirit of 1980 CCW Protocol I which prohibits the
use of weapons that primarily injure by non-detectable fragments;42
whether miniaturized missiles and similar explosive projectiles run
counter to the prohibition on the use of explodingbullets;43 whether
nano-enhanced lasers raise issues under CCW Protocol IV on blinding
laser weapons;44 whether small armed robots undermine the effectiveness
of existing strictures on landmines;45 and whether a nanodevice that is
designed to kill or injure and functions unexpectedly when a person
performs an apparently safe act, such as breathing, violates the
prohibition on booby traps.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY CONTINUED\>\>

[[IHL]{.mark} also [limits the use of **nano-enhanced weapons**]{.mark},
means and methods of warfare.]{.underline} Fighters are protected
against weapons, means or methods of warfare of a nature to cause
superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering or that render death
inevitable,47 as may be the case with nanomaterial-induced health
effects. [[Civilians]{.mark} 'enjoy general protection against dangers
arising from military operations]{.underline}',48 which would include,
for example, protection from hazardous nanoparticles released into the
environment as a result of the degradation of armour or as components of
surveillance networks. [They [are]{.mark} also [protected **against
attacks**]{.mark} employing a method or means of combat whose effects
cannot be limited as required by IHL]{.underline}, for example, due to
the release of hazardous particles.49 Precautions must be taken against
such effects, including in the choice of weapons and targets, so as to
minimize the danger to civilians.50

Additional restrictions derive from states' duties under international
human rights and environmental law. [[Everyone is **protected**]{.mark},
at all times, [against discriminatory targeting practices]{.mark}51 [and
acts of **genocide**]{.mark}]{.underline}, 52 which may be facilitated
by the ability to target at the DNA level. In light of the release of
potentially hazardous nanoparticles during security or military
operations, states must take measures to effectively protect the rights
to life, health and food.53 In this regard, measures to prevent
environmental damage, including in armed conflict, will be particularly
important. Nanotechnology-enabled surveillance possibilities call for
measures by states to protect the right to privacy.54 States should also
anticipate that the difficulty of detecting nanomaterials or nanodevices
is likely to exacerbate existing accountability challenges, especially
where applications are tested on or used among populations that have
limited recourse against their effects.

deposits]{.mark} on the island would entail [extracting the **toxic**
and **radioactive** materials]{.mark} that are part of the same

Even if the CRMA did provide enough incentive for mining to restart in
Greenland, this would still not be a cure-all for the EU's rare earth
woes. European mines only cover about 30 percent of its critical raw
material needs, so even once extraction begins in Greenland, which would
also be a lengthy process, significant rare earths dependency reduction
would still hinge on the success of EU partnerships with third
countries, such as the one currently under negotiation with the United
States. Additionally, even if the EU were to secure the means to extract
the necessary rare earths to limit its dependency on Chinese extraction
sites, it is still a substantial importer of key components and finished

Many believe that open-pit mining of Greenland's rare earth metals is
necessary to build and run electric cars, windmills, and solar panels.
Except open-pit mining of Greenland's rare earth metals will have a far
greater impact environmental impact than portrayed by the media, the
United States Government, and mining companies.

I was one of two onsite geologists who aided in the expansion of Idaho's
huge open-pit Maybe Canyon Phosphate Mine. This experience taught me
that it is difficult to appreciate the size and complex operations of a
giant open-pit mine unless you have worked in one. I am certain the
public does not have any idea of the processes involved in open-pit
mining. 

Like most products, the public thinks that rare earth metals magically
appear. They Don't.

The photo below is Utah's Kennicott open-pit copper mine, which is 2.5
miles wide, 0.75 miles deep, and has removed six billion tons of rock
rich in copper.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Utah's Open Pit Copper Mine, which is 2.5 miles wide, 0.75 feet deep,
and has removed 6 billion tons of rock. Copper is a rare earth metal so
this mine is an excellent example of what an open-pit mine in Greenland
would look like.

Operations of an Open-pit Mine

Use chemicals that were taken from another mined area to explode solid
rock areas of the mine.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Use diesel-powered machines to reduce the size of large boulders created
by the explosions.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Utilize multiple monster diesel-fueled trucks to haul off the crushed
rock. Trucks that are built with iron extracted from another mine and
rubber tires that are generated by processing oil. You need to drill
wells, some in ocean areas, to produce oil.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Build a diesel- or natural gas-fueled refinery plant. It is important to
note that natural gas is composed of 90% methane. So, the refineries
will emit huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Also, a rare
earth metal plant needs 20 tons of water (150 trillion gallons of water)
to make one ton of rare earth metals.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Build a large reservoir capable of retaining vast amounts of mined waste
rock.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Construct a network of huge pipelines to transport mined waste rock to
the mined waste-rock retaining reservoir.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Ship the now concentrated metals to another processing plant that
prepares the metals, which are placed in a renewable-energy device.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

Restore the mined area to its original state. This process uses monster
trucks, graders, etc. So, the restoration process also has a large
carbon footprint.

Potential Environmental Damage from the Open-Pit Mining Process

The process of open-pit mining Greenland's rare earth metals will
cause significant, unintended, and irreversible damage to Greenland's
physical and biological environments. Here are a few examples.

1\. Scares on Pristine Coastlines.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

2\. Failure of Mine Waste Rock Retaining Lakes

Pictured below is the failure of Imperial Metals Mount Polley gold and
copper mine waste-rock retaining-reservoir failure. This occurred in
British Columbia, Canada, and it dumped 24 million cubic meters (more
than 31 million cubic yards) of mine waste and sludge into neighboring
Lake Polley and polluted the Hazeltine Creek watershed (above figure
and here). Through the years, thousands of waste-rock retaining
reservoirs and lakes have failed. Mostly because when the mines are
abandoned, they aren't maintained. Failure of Greenland's rare earth
metal mines would empty into surrounding ocean areas and bays. Not good.

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

3\. Radioactive Pollution

Greenland's rare earth metal accumulations are very rich in radioactive
uranium. In the not-so-distant past, Greenland was on the verge of
opening a monster open-pit mine that contained significant amounts of
uranium. "Greenland may soon start building the world's fifth-largest
uranium mine and second-biggest rare earth operation, which could fuel
independence dreams in the island, an "autonomous administrative
division" within Denmark since 2009" ( see here ). However, native
Greenlanders strongly objected to the mining of radioactive-rich
rocks near their hunting grounds and villages. The proposed mines are
known to have high levels of radioactive rocks. The quote below details
the presence of radioactive rocks in the open-mining areas within
Greenland.

*"NOAH and Renewable Energy, another Danish NGO, list many serious
environmental costs if the Kvanefjeld mine is allowed to proceed. There
are huge risks from air pollution during open-cut mining and even
greater risks associated with dumping radioactive waste in Lake Tareq.
In addition to uranium, the radioactive waste would include thorium.
Thorium tailings are 3‒10 times more radioactive than uranium, the two
NGOs pointed out in their September 12 submission, responding to the
mine's latest Environmental Impact Statement. The tailings will cause
health problems, even if the built-in dams behave as planned. The risk
increases over time, primarily after the mine has been shut down and
when monitoring and maintenance have been completed. In addition to the
planned discharges, there will be unintentional spills via leaks and
accidents. In the long run, large areas around the mine will be
contaminated with radioactive elements and non-radioactive substances,
many of which are highly toxic. The people living in the polluted areas
will be permanently exposed to radioactive and other toxic substances
via drinking water, food, and air. Seafood is also becoming polluted due
to the massive discharges of waste, including wastewater, along the
coast. Bioaccumulation of radionuclides and non-radioactive chemicals
can become a serious problem. All this means that uranium mining in
Kuannersuit in addition to significant chemical pollution will leave
millions of tons of tailings containing some of the most toxic known
radioactive substances, such as radium, thorium, radon, and polonium,
and this waste remains radioactive at a dangerous level for hundreds of
thousands of years. In addition, the Arctic environment is particularly
vulnerable to pollution because it is rebuilding very slowly, and the
long-term consequences of uranium mining could be extensive radioactive
pollution, which, due to the health hazard, may make it necessary to ban
agriculture, fishing, trapping, and livestock farming."* (see here).

4\. Mercury Pollution

Research studies have proven that the rivers, ocean bays, and open ocean
waters in the proposed Greenland mining areas have extremely high
concentrations of natural mercury. Mercury comes from bedrock layers
that are mercury rich. Mercury is a rare earth mineral. If anything goes
awry with the mining process, huge additional amounts of natural mercury
will get dumped into Greenland's seawater and freshwater systems.

*"Unlike polluted rivers in other parts of the world, contaminated by
industrial activity, the researchers believe the Greenland mercury is
coming from natural sources. If it were coming from human pollution,
then the snow on top of the ice sheet should also be full of
mercury---yet previous studies have shown it's comparatively clean.
Instead, the scientists believe the meltwater mercury is probably
leaching out of the bedrock beneath the ice. Mercury concentration in
the meltwater rivers was at least an order of magnitude higher than the
concentrations found in ordinary rivers across the Arctic. These
concentrations became slightly diluted by the time they flowed out into
the fjords---but were still higher than expected, the researchers say.
Even after mingling with the salty water, the levels in the fjords
remained about an order of magnitude higher than the mercury levels
found in most open ocean waters"* (see here).

Who Controls the World's Despots of Rare Earth Metals

Prior to the 1980s, the United States was the world's top owner of rare
earth metals. Beginning in the 1980s, environmental groups began taking
action to shut down all the United States' rare earth mines, saying they
were destroying the environment.

They succeeded.

By the middle of the 1990s, there was only one operating rare earth
metal mine in the United States and this one is near abandonment. During
this time, the United States gave up its legal right to own another
country's accumulations of rare earth metals.

These actions have had consequences.

China now owns 90% of the Earth's rare earth metals. The recent tensions
between China and the United States could result in them ending sales to
the United States or greatly raising the sale price of its rare earth
metals to the United States. When China's economy recovers from the
current worldwide financial slowdown, its economy will return to its
fast-paced growth. This rapid growth will force China to use most of
its rare earth supplies. As a result, China will reduce sales to the
United States. China has done a very poor job of keeping their rare
earth metal mines environmentally safe as seen in the photo below (see
here).

\[CHART OMMITTED\]

This article is purposely loaded with numerous photos of open-pit mining
operations for a reason. A picture tells a thousand words. Too often,
recent media articles have used words and not pictures to convince the
public that open-pit mining of Greenland's rare earth metals will help
save the environment. It's normal to believe that open-pit mining of
many minerals is necessary to support human life. However, it is
also necessary to inform the public that open-pit mining is a very messy
business. In fact, open-pit mining in Greenland may help mitigate
destroying parts of the United States. This, though, will be at the
expense of damaging Greenland's pristine environment.

*Old Materials, New Risks*

The EU's move is a critical step toward recognizing nanomaterials as a
potential new hazard that requires new rules and new information.

The raw materials of nanotechnology are familiar. Carbon, silver, and
metals like iron and titanium are among the most common. But at the
nanoscale, these well-known substances take on new and unpredictable
properties. That's what makes them so versatile and valuable. It also
makes them potentially dangerous in ways that their larger-scale
counterparts are not.\
\
Yet governments are only beginning to grapple with those dangers.
Japan's labor department issued a notice in February requiring measures
to protect workers from exposure to nanomaterials: It may be the world's
first nano-specific regulation affecting actual practices. Previously,
Berkeley, California --- ever ready to stand alone --- had adopted what
is apparently the only nano-specific regulation in the United States: a
requirement that companies submit toxicology reports about nanomaterials
they're using.

At the federal level, the EPA launched a voluntary reporting program in
January; industry participation has been anemic. Both the EPA and the
Food and Drug Administration have so far declined to regulate
nanomaterials as such, saying they're covered under existing
regulations. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
has issued recommendations for handling nanomaterials, but the agency
has no enforcement power.

The European Union, by contrast, is taking a precautionary approach.
While U.S. regulators generally presume products to be safe until proven
harmful, the EU's new REACH legislation demands that manufacturers
demonstrate the safety of their chemicals. Just last week, the EU
released a document concluding that nanorisks "can be dealt with under
the current legislative framework," with some modifications. For
example, the document says that under REACH, when companies introduce
nanoforms of existing substances, they must provide additional material
about "the specific properties, hazards, and risks" of the
nanomaterials.

At this point, however, many of the most basic questions about those
nanohazards are unanswered. What materials are harmful, in what particle
sizes and shapes, under what conditions? Who is at risk: Workers? People
using nano-enabled products? Wildlife and ecosystems? How should we
measure exposures?

The U.S. government spends \$1.5 billion a year on nano research. Less
than 5 percent of that is aimed at addressing these fundamental
questions.

*Danger Signs*

What is known about nanohazards counsels caution.

Nanomaterials are so small that they travel easily, both in the body and
in the environment. Their tiny size and high surface area give them
unusual characteristics: insoluble materials become soluble;
nonconductive ones start conducting electricity; harmless substances can
become toxic.

Nanoparticles are easily inhaled. They can pass from the lungs into the
bloodstream and other organs. They can even slip through the olfactory
nerve into the brain, evading the protective blood-brain barrier. It's
not clear whether they penetrate the skin. Once they're inside the body,
it's not clear how long they remain or what they do. What's more,
current science has no way of testing for nano-waste in the air or
water, and no way of cleaning up such pollution.\
\
The tiny cylinders known as carbon nanotubes, or CNTs, are among the
most widely used nanomaterials. These tubes, which come in different
sizes and shapes, lend extraordinary strength and lightness to bicycle
frames and tennis rackets; researchers are also investigating uses in
medicine, electronics and other fields. The recent UK study found that
long, straight CNTs, when injected into lab mice, cause scarring even
faster than asbestos. One of the investigators predicts the scarring
will lead to cancer; other experts are less sure. The study doesn't
prove whether it's possible to inhale enough CNTs to cause the same
results as the injections. But which workers want to serve as the test
cases?

Another red flag is silver. Manufacturers are lacing ordinary household
objects --- from toothpaste to teddy bears --- with nanoparticles of
silver, long known for its disinfecting powers. A recent experiment on
nanosilver-containing socks, touted as odor-eating, found that silver
particles leaked out into the wash water. Once there, the silver could
interfere with water-treatment efforts, in part by killing good microbes
as well as the nasty ones, and might threaten aquatic life (a fear
supported by the zebrafish study).

When Samsung started marketing a washing machine that emits silver ions
two years ago, a national association of wastewater treatment
authorities asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate
such equipment as pesticides. And indeed, EPA has required some
manufacturers to register nanosilver-containing products --- like
computer keyboards --- as pesticides or drop their germ-killing claims.

A farm-oriented pesticide law dating to 1947 is scarcely the right tool
for addressing the 21st-century hazards of nanotechnology. But it's the
only tool that EPA enforcers have, since the agency's policymakers have
explicitly declined to regulate nanomaterials as such.

phase transformation and the dispersive nature of the deposited
carbonaceous materials," Wu said. "[This [provides tremendous insight
for further optimization."]{.mark}]{.underline}

The new plasma approach enhances the reactivity of commercial 40-60
nanometer particles. For comparison, a human hair is typically 60,000
nanometers in width. According to Wu, the method involves first treating
with a helium plasma to etch away a significant portion of their inert
oxide shell and then treating with a helium/carbon monoxide plasma to
deposit a reactive surface coating.

"Plasma science is a fascinating emerging technology for many
applications but has yet to be sufficiently explored in the energetics
community," she said. "All this is done in a custom dielectric barrier
discharge plasma reactor. The resultant particles were then
characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy
revealing important nanoscale surface and chemical composition features.
We are constantly seeking new energetic materials with higher energy
densities and faster energy release rates."

Plasma treatment and synthesis, coupled with comprehensive material
characterization, is critically important for optimizing methodologies
and materials for scale-up and transition, she said.

Dr. Rose Pesce-Rodriguez, also from the laboratory and a co-author of
the study, said the plasma approach developed by Wu has opened new
possibilities for the U.S. Army to effectively surface-engineer metallic
nanoparticles for energetics applications.

"Aluminum is just the first example," Pesce-Rodriguez said. "Since 2018,
several parallel efforts involving in-house, DOD, DOE and academic
collaborations have blossomed. Making headway on this problem is
difficult because samples are so small and require specialized
technology to image and analyze."

According to Pesce-Rodriguez, the microscopy tools available at
DEVCOM-ARL and Argonne enabled Wu and collaborators to do a "[remarkable
job" of characterizing the new plasma-treated particles.]{.underline}

"We're looking forward to more exciting discoveries," Pesce-Rodriguez
said. "It seems we're learning something new almost every day."

Wu said her ultimate goal is for DEVCOM-ARL to develop and transition
energetic materials through a unique combination of innovative plasma
technologies and advanced materials characterization techniques.

Collaborative partners in this study are Drs. Jianguo Wen and Ilke
Arslan at the Center for Nanoscale Materials, Argonne National
Laboratory.

"It's been great to collaborate with Dr. Chi-Chin Wu and her team on
advanced disruptive energetics," Wen said. "This gives Argonne the
opportunity to bring our expertise and unique capabilities to
challenging Army problems."

Dr. Mark Tschopp, the regional lead of ARL Central in the Chicago area,
said this is a great example of collaboration between the Army and the
Department of Energy.

["It combines the expertise of scientists at both laboratories along
with unique facilities at the Department of Energy User Facility Center
for Nanoscale Materials,"]{.underline} he said. "Expanding the Army team
to include other partners is vital to tackling some of the fascinating
and challenging science that the Army Research Laboratory is pursuing in
areas such as at the intersection of energetics and plasma science."

According to Wu, the work is an example of how the laboratory is working
to operationalize science to provide energetics for transformational
advances.

**Del Monte '19** \[Louis A; January 14; Physicist, M.S. in Physics at
the University of Fordham University, and B.S. in Physics at Saint
Peter's University; Air University, "Nanoweapons: A Growing Threat to
Humanity,"

SM

When new technologies cross from industry to the battlefield, calls
arise to slow the process and consider international implications of
using these weapons. Louis A. Del Monte's *Nanoweapons *is one of those
calls. A physicist and former executive at IBM and Honeywell, Del Monte
led advancements in microelectronics and sensors. His work is a serious
attempt to use publicly available information to address the development
and use of nanotechnology as weapons. The author brings together ideas
normally relegated to science fiction (e.g., laser weapons, artificial
intelligence, and self-replicating nanorobots) and uses his technical
background to inform the reader as to what is science fact. While his
most alarming predictions for humanity's survival project to the year
2050 and beyond, he argues that his concerns are timely. He indicates
that while revolutionary military nanotechnologies (e.g., stealth
aircraft) may take decades to field, they are none­theless currently
being developed. Now, according to the author, is the time to discuss
the dangers of nanoweapons.

The author's main thesis is that [nanoweapons are a danger to humanity
that demand greater attention.]{.underline} Despite the secrecy
surrounding the development of nanoweapons, Del Monte is confident of
their threat. [This fear is based in part on the ranking of
nanotech­nology weapons]{.underline} by the Global Catastrophic Risk
Conference at the University of Oxford [as the most probable means to
cause human extinction by the end of this century.]{.underline} Ex­amples
of nanoweapons discussed in the book include nano-enhanced lasers,
smaller munitions with increased explosive force, and self-replicating
smart nanorobots (SSN). SSNs search for and destroy targets without
human input and self-replicate with materi­als found in the environment.
According to the author, SSNs are gravely dangerous nanoweapons that
humanity should prohibit. Central to his concern for humanity's sur­vival
is what he sees as the inherent difficulty in mounting defenses to
nanoweapons given their capability to avoid detection and the ability of
those who use these arms to escape attribution. While considerable
resources have been dedicated to countering nu­clear weapons, little is
publicly known about protection from nanoweapons. This is espe­cially
concerning to the author because [some nanoweapons have characteristics
similar to biological pathogens.]{.underline} Giving his readers reason
to be apprehensive, Del Monte turns to explaining how [**today's
nanotechnology** can be used to create nanoweapons.]{.underline}

While nanotechnology is already improving our computers, sunscreens, and
building materials, the first section of the book provides the
nontechnical reader an easy-to-understand introduction to nanotechnology
and how it may be used in arms development. The author organizes
nanoweapons into five categories: offensive strategic, defensive
stra­tegic, offensive tactical, defensive tactical, and passive. Examples
are provided for each category, along with an explanation of its
offensive, defensive, or passive nature. For in­stance, the offensive
strategic category includes [artificially intelligent nanorobots that
can target particular individuals,]{.underline} hypersonic glide
missiles (whose development will rely on developing certain
nanomaterials), nano-enhanced fuels, and nonelectric guidance sys­tems.
The other categories include additional guidance for organizing
nanoweapons. While readers will find these categories helpful, a
workable definition of nanoweapons is missing.

With this deep level of organization dedicated to understanding
nanoweaponry, the reader would hope for a more useful definition of
nanoweapons. *Nanoweapons *are de­fined in the book's glossary as "any
military technology which exploits the use of nano­technology (229)."
Although this definition will capture all nanoweapons, it will also
include many items that are not weapons. This definition would include a
military fi­nance office using a publicly available desktop computer with
a nanomanufactured mi­crochip. Is building a weapon with nanomanufactured
components all that is required to make the weapon a nanoweapon? If a
dry-docked ship is sprayed with anticorrosive nanocoating---increasing
its hull strength tenfold (as an MIT study referenced in the book
suggests)---is the ship now a nanoweapon? The book makes clear that
nanotechnol­ogy is an enabling technology that will empower a wide range
of civilian and military applications. But it does not wrestle with the
problem that an SSN is fundamentally different than an anticorrosive
nanocoating. This issue of defining nanotechnology is a common attribute
of nascent scientific fields, but the reader is nevertheless left
wanting more. Without addressing this definitional problem directly, Del
Monte instead uses other methods to discover what nations are emerging
as nanoweapon leaders.

He categorizes the factors needed to facilitate nanoweaponry development
and sorts nations by these factors into the Nanoweapons Offensive
Capability of Nations (NO­CON) list. The most powerful group, nanoweapon
nations---such as the United States and China---has the ability to
commercialize nanotechnology, possesses a national desire to strengthen
its militaries, and demonstrates an ability to partner with other
leading nanotechnology nations. Del Monte goes on to mention other
nations on his NOCON list, all of which have varying interactions with
nanotechnology. Giving the reader reason to be concerned for the
international implications his NOCON suggests, he then high­lights the
events that may tip us into a nanoweapon-driven war.

[He predicts two singularities that will spawn nanoweapon-related
international dis­ruptions.]{.underline} In addition to the creation of
SSNs, the other singularity is the advent of arti­ficial intelligence
(AI) that will exceed human intellect. AI will solve many of humanity's
greatest problems, the author posits, but it will also create better
SSNs. If AI and SSNs are combined, alliances will form to maintain
advantages in a new cold war around the development of AI-powered SSNs.
Given their importance, international power will then be rebalanced
around nanoweapon capabilities. [Nuclear weapon use will increase since
nanotechnology will empower their miniaturization and reduce their
fallout. It is these disruptions, brought on by the AI and SSN
singularities, that Del Monte claims will dramatically increase the
chance of human extinction by 2100]{.underline}. Given this pessimistic
prediction, *Nanoweapons *next discusses reasons for hope.

NT-RS

Earth is currently experiencing a host of environmental problems. Air
and water pollution continue to plague much of the world; exotic plants,
animals, and other organisms pop up in parts of the globe that have no
natural defense against them; and, all the while, climate
change lingers in the headlines. It's often difficult to find good
environmental news, but [environmentalists and [scientists]{.mark} have
[reported]{.mark} one bright spot: [the]{.mark} countries of the [world
rallying to combat the problem of ozone depletion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Earth's protective ozone layer sits some 15 to 35 km \[9 to 22 miles\]
above Earth's surface, in the stratosphere. [Stratospheric ozone loss is
worrisome because the ozone layer effectively blocks certain types
of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and other forms of radiation that could
injure or kill most living things.]{.underline} For 30 years countries
around the world had worked together to reduce and eliminate the use
of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-destroying chemicals
(ODCs). However, scientists still could not say whether these efforts
were helping. Was the ozone layer actually healing itself?

Before getting to the answer, it helps to have some background on the
problem. In 1974 American chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood
Rowland and Dutch chemist Paul Crutzen discovered that human-produced
CFCs could be a major source of chlorine in the stratosphere. They also
noted that chlorine could destroy extensive amounts of ozone after it
was liberated from CFCs by UV radiation. Since then, scientists have
tracked how the ozone layer has responded to CFCs, which, since their
creation in 1928 had been used as refrigerants, cleaners, and
propellants in hairsprays, spray paint, and aerosol containers. In 1985
a paper by the British Antarctic Survey revealed that stratospheric
ozone concentrations over Antarctica had been dropping precipitously (by
more than 60% compared with global averages) since the late 1970s.
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, observations and measurements from
satellites and other instruments showed that this "hole" over Antarctica
was growing larger year after year, that a similar hole had opened over
the Arctic, and that stratospheric ozone coverage worldwide had dropped
5% between 1970 and the mid-1990s, with little change afterward.

[In response to the growing problem, much of the [world came together in
1987 to sign the Montreal Protocol]{.mark} on Substances That Deplete
the Ozone Layer, an agreement [that allowed the world to begin to phase
out]{.mark} the manufacturing and use of
[CFCs]{.mark}]{.underline}---molecules containing only carbon, fluorine,
and chlorine atoms---and other ODCs. Follow-up meetings throughout the
1990s and early 2000s produced amendments aimed at limiting, reducing,
and eliminating hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), methyl bromide, carbon
tetrachloride, trichloroethane, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and other ODCs. Even though nearly all
of the planet's governments had been working diligently toward a common
goal---good news in itself---[it was unclear whether these unprecedented
efforts were having much of an effect.]{.underline}

[[In 2014]{.mark}, however, [scientists received]{.mark} the first bit
of [good news]{.mark} on this topic: the first small [increases
in]{.mark} [stratospheric ozone]{.mark} in more than 20 years had been
[detected, along with]{.mark} evidence that [ODCs]{.mark} had
[declined]{.mark} [by 10--15% in]{.mark} the atmosphere.]{.underline}
Yet they remained cautious. Some [[two years later]{.mark}, scientists
got [sufficient data]{.mark} to confidently [reveal proof that the ozone
layer was]{.mark} indeed [on a path to
recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[2016 study,]{.mark} which tracked
the evolution of the size of the ozone hole over Antarctica, [observed
that stratospheric ozone]{.mark} [concentrations]{.mark} were
[continuing to increase]{.mark} and that the size of the Antarctic ozone
hole had declined by half the size of the continental U.S. between 2000
and 2015. They expected the ozone layer to fully heal sometime between
2040 and 2070.]{.underline}

[[In 2023]{.mark}, a [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [study]{.mark}

#### MCB backfires\-\--causes cascading atmospheric disruptions

NT-LC

"[[MCB]{.mark}, or in fact any other troposphere-based intervention,
[isn't just affecting surface climate]{.mark}]{.underline}," said lead
author Ewa Bednarz, a CIRES researcher affiliated with NOAA\'s Chemical
Sciences Laboratory (CSL). "[We found [it could drive]{.mark} a [cascade
of]{.mark} dynamical and chemical [changes]{.mark} that could reach all
the way [into the stratosphere, affecting ozone levels]{.mark} in both
the lower and middle atmosphere]{.underline}."

Using the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), the research team started with
a high-end global warming scenario and simulated a large-scale MCB
deployment to lower temperatures to those found in a moderate global
warming scenario. The findings were surprising: [the impacts of such an
[MCB deployment changed atmospheric composition and circulation
throughout]{.mark} the troposphere and stratosphere, which increased
ozone in some regions of the atmosphere while decreasing it in
others.]{.underline}

Winners and losers in the ozone layer

Ozone is a fundamental component of our atmosphere: in the middle
atmosphere, its presence shields living beings from harmful ultraviolet
(UV) radiation; when produced near the surface, however, often as a
byproduct of various atmospheric pollutants, it can be harmful for
humans and ecosystems.

[[In the tropics]{.mark}, the simulated [MCB]{.mark} scenario
[caused]{.mark} an [increase in]{.mark} total [ozone]{.mark}
column]{.underline} (the sum of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone)
[of [up to 5%]{.mark} due to weakened upwelling of ozone-poor air
[from]{.mark} lower, [tropospheric]{.mark}, altitudes [and]{.mark}
increased ozone [production]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.mark} elevated
nitrogen oxides ([NOx]{.mark}) produced by
[lightning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But at the same time, further north, the story was different. [[Over the
North]{.mark}ern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, [MCB led to a drop in total
column ozone of about 3%.]{.mark} This decrease was most pronounced in
winter and spring, and was driven by the MCB-induced changes in
stratospheric circulation and ozone transport.]{.underline}

The Southern Hemisphere showed a more mixed response. While MCB
decreased total column ozone in mid-latitudes during austral winter and
spring, it also surprisingly boosted ozone over Antarctica during
springtime due to changes in the polar vortex that limited the
halogen-based ozone destruction that causes the seasonal Ozone Hole.

Unexpected atmospheric chain reactions

The research highlights how a troposphere-level intervention like MCB
could trigger a cascade of atmospheric changes that extend all the way
to the middle atmosphere.

[[MCB]{.mark} could cool the surface and upper troposphere, but this in
turn [would alter wind patterns and]{.mark} affect the strength of the
large-scale stratospheric overturning [circulation]{.mark}, known as the
Brewer-Dobson Circulation.]{.underline} [[These effects]{.mark} in turn
[alter]{.mark} how [ozone and other gases]{.mark} are transported
vertically and across latitudes.]{.underline}

Adding to the complexity, the [[MCB]{.mark} strategy simulated in the
study also [triggered]{.mark} a [La Niña-like cooling]{.mark} pattern
[in the]{.mark} eastern [Pacific]{.mark}. That pattern [further
disrupted planetary wave activity and stratospheric transport and
mixing, as well as]{.mark} [strengthened]{.mark} the [Northern]{.mark}
Hemisphere [polar vortex that]{.mark} is known to [promote ozone
depletion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[[Once you perturb the surface temperatures]{.mark}, both globally and
regionally, [it affects the entire atmospheric system]{.mark}," said
Bednarz. "These are not isolated layers. They are deeply
interconnected."]{.underline}\
Beyond dynamics, [[MCB also]{.mark} influenced the [chemistry of the
atmosphere]{.mark}. [Lightning activity increased]{.mark} in the model
due to changes in clouds and precipitation, [driving more]{.mark} NOx
and ozone [production in the]{.mark} tropical upper troposphere and
[lower stratosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, colder temperatures led to drier air across the troposphere
and stratosphere, which also favors ozone preservation in the tropics by
reducing water vapor-driven destruction pathways.

[Can We Live Without the Ozone Layer?]{.underline}

[No. **[All life on Earth]{.mark}** as we know it **[would cease to
exist without the ozone layer]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This protective
layer keeps the full power of the sun's UV radiation from reaching the
surface of the Earth. [If this radiation reaches the Earth's
surface unimpeded, it can lead to skin cancer and cataracts. Plus, it is
very harmful on many other levels to the DNA of plants and
animals. ]{.underline}

[What Will Happen if the Ozone Layer Is Destroyed?]{.underline}

[In just days of us losing the ozone layer protection, the [radiation
from the sun]{.mark} would **[make photosynthesis]{.mark}
[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} for plants[, [leading to]{.mark} the
[**mass extinction** of]{.mark} many [plants]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only
the largest and slowest-growing plants would survive this wave.
[Eventually]{.underline}, though, [[even]{.underline}]{.mark} these
larger and [[more resilient plants]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as some of
the largest trees in the world, [would [succumb.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} would [lead to]{.mark} the [death of]{.mark} most
[herbivores]{.mark} on the planet]{.underline}, eventually [[**choking
off the food supply** for]{.mark} [carnivores and
omnivores]{.mark}]{.underline}. This impact to the ecosystem would
eventually [[lead to]{.mark} the **[worldwide extinction]{.mark} [of all
animals]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And any [remaining animals]{.underline}
would likely [die from skin cancer]{.underline} due to the sun's harmful
radiation. 

On top of all this, [you would not be able to set foot in the sunlight
without almost instantly starting to burn,]{.underline} as the
unfiltered sunlight contacts your skin. 

Is There Still a Hole in the Ozone Layer in 2022?

While the hole in the ozone layer has shrunk over the years and
the total ozone density has increased, it remains in place as of 2022.
[The Antarctica ozone hole]{.underline} had an average size of 8.91
million miles in 2022. This sounds massive --- and it is --- but it's
[smaller than the 8.99 million square miles in 2021 and significantly
smaller than its average size at its peak in 2006.]{.underline} 

[How Does Ozone Depletion Affect Human Life?]{.underline}

Ozone depletion can have a range of effects on human life, directly and
indirectly. Most directly, ozone depletion increases the amount of [[UV
radiation]{.underline}]{.mark} that reaches the Earth's surface. This
can [[lead to]{.mark} increased skin
cancer cases]{.underline}, cataracts, [and]{.underline} even
[compromised immune systems]{.underline}. It is also believed these [UV
rays increase]{.underline} the [cases of [melanoma, the **most
deadly skin cancer**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

On a more indirect level, [[ozone depletion]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[reduce]{.mark} the yields of]{.underline} certain [crops]{.underline},
such as soybeans, [reducing our **[food supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Plus[,
[increased u]{.mark}]{.underline}ltra[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}iolet
[[radiation]{.underline}]{.mark} is also believed to [[put
**phytoplankton**]{.mark} --- the base food source in the ocean ---
[under stress]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark} can work
its way up the food chain, [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[our **food
supply from**]{.mark} **[the seas]{.mark}. **]{.underline}

Ozone loss can also impact climate change, as ozone depletion in the
lower stratosphere can create a cooling effect on the Earth.
However, ozone depletion is not viewed as a significant contributor to
overall climate change or global warming.

#### MCB backfires\-\--causes cascading atmospheric disruptions

"[[MCB]{.mark}, or in fact any other troposphere-based intervention,
[isn't just affecting surface climate]{.mark}]{.underline}," said lead
author Ewa Bednarz, a CIRES researcher affiliated with NOAA\'s Chemical
Sciences Laboratory (CSL). "[We found [it could drive]{.mark} a [cascade
of]{.mark} dynamical and chemical [changes]{.mark} that could reach all
the way [into the stratosphere, affecting ozone levels]{.mark} in both
the lower and middle atmosphere]{.underline}."

Using the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), the research team started with
a high-end global warming scenario and simulated a large-scale MCB
deployment to lower temperatures to those found in a moderate global
warming scenario. The findings were surprising: [the impacts of such an
[MCB deployment changed atmospheric composition and circulation
throughout]{.mark} the troposphere and stratosphere, which increased
ozone in some regions of the atmosphere while decreasing it in
others.]{.underline}

Winners and losers in the ozone layer

Ozone is a fundamental component of our atmosphere: in the middle
atmosphere, its presence shields living beings from harmful ultraviolet
(UV) radiation; when produced near the surface, however, often as a
byproduct of various atmospheric pollutants, it can be harmful for
humans and ecosystems.

[[In the tropics]{.mark}, the simulated [MCB]{.mark} scenario
[caused]{.mark} an [increase in]{.mark} total [ozone]{.mark}
column]{.underline} (the sum of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone)
[of [up to 5%]{.mark} due to weakened upwelling of ozone-poor air
[from]{.mark} lower, [tropospheric]{.mark}, altitudes [and]{.mark}
increased ozone [production]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.mark} elevated
nitrogen oxides ([NOx]{.mark}) produced by
[lightning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But at the same time, further north, the story was different. [[Over the
North]{.mark}ern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, [MCB led to a drop in total
column ozone of about 3%.]{.mark} This decrease was most pronounced in
winter and spring, and was driven by the MCB-induced changes in
stratospheric circulation and ozone transport.]{.underline}

The Southern Hemisphere showed a more mixed response. While MCB
decreased total column ozone in mid-latitudes during austral winter and
spring, it also surprisingly boosted ozone over Antarctica during
springtime due to changes in the polar vortex that limited the
halogen-based ozone destruction that causes the seasonal Ozone Hole.

Unexpected atmospheric chain reactions

The research highlights how a troposphere-level intervention like MCB
could trigger a cascade of atmospheric changes that extend all the way
to the middle atmosphere.

[[MCB]{.mark} could cool the surface and upper troposphere, but this in
turn [would alter wind patterns and]{.mark} affect the strength of the
large-scale stratospheric overturning [circulation]{.mark}, known as the
Brewer-Dobson Circulation.]{.underline} [[These effects]{.mark} in turn
[alter]{.mark} how [ozone and other gases]{.mark} are transported
vertically and across latitudes.]{.underline}

Adding to the complexity, the [[MCB]{.mark} strategy simulated in the
study also [triggered]{.mark} a [La Niña-like cooling]{.mark} pattern
[in the]{.mark} eastern [Pacific]{.mark}. That pattern [further
disrupted planetary wave activity and stratospheric transport and
mixing, as well as]{.mark} [strengthened]{.mark} the [Northern]{.mark}
Hemisphere [polar vortex that]{.mark} is known to [promote ozone
depletion]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[[Once you perturb the surface temperatures]{.mark}, both globally and
regionally, [it affects the entire atmospheric system]{.mark}," said
Bednarz. "These are not isolated layers. They are deeply
interconnected."]{.underline}\
Beyond dynamics, [[MCB also]{.mark} influenced the [chemistry of the
atmosphere]{.mark}. [Lightning activity increased]{.mark} in the model
due to changes in clouds and precipitation, [driving more]{.mark} NOx
and ozone [production in the]{.mark} tropical upper troposphere and
[lower stratosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, colder temperatures led to drier air across the troposphere
and stratosphere, which also favors ozone preservation in the tropics by
reducing water vapor-driven destruction pathways. 

#### Different types of SAI all cause ozone depletion

3.1.3 Modeling of SAI ozone effects. [[Stratospheric O3 depletion caused
by]{.mark}]{.underline} substantial stratospheric aerosol burden has
been extensively investigated using numerical simulations in several SAI
scenarios [using [sulfate]{.mark}]{.underline}81,89,102,175,265 and
other [[aerosol]{.mark}
material[s]{.mark}]{.underline}.86,142,143 Pitari et al. (2014)
conducted a comprehensive study of sulfate SAI. The authors modelled the
global O3 response for different SO2 injection scenarios, G3 and G4 of
GeoMIP,182 using two general circulation models, GISS-E2-R and
MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and two coupled chemistry-climate models, ULAQ-CCM and
GEOSCCM.102 Even though both scenarios have RCP4.5 (ref. 180) as the
anthropogenic forcing profile, G3 involves periodic injections of SO2 to
keep the TOA net radiation constant, whereas G4 involves a constant
injection of 5 Tg SO2 annually. A summary of the study results is
included in Table 1. During the simulated SAI period of 2020--2070, the
global O3 column was depleted at a slower rate over time for G4, as seen
in Fig. 8a. Due to the estimated decline in stratospheric chlorine
burden via the Montreal Protocol and the continued suppression of the
NOx cycle via(R4), global O3 level was projected to recover over the SAI
period. Unlike G4, G3 simulations predicted a steeper increase in global
O3 loss especially in the absence of aerosol heterogeneous chemistry
(Fig. 8b). Fig. 8c depicts the varying latitudinal distributions of
O3 column anomaly for the decade 2040--2049, which was caused by the
different assumptions in the models, such as aerosol heterogeneous
chemistry, microphysics, and photolysis changes. For example, GISS-E2-R
G4nhc simulated up to 15 DU reduction in the mid-latitudes due to the
lack of NOx cycle in the model to compensate for the photochemical
O3 depletion. On the other hand, other G4 simulations like ULAQ-CCM only
predicted less than 5 DU reduction in the O3 column. Despite the varying
degrees of stratospheric O3 depletion based on model parameters, this
2014 study like many other modeling studies81,142,143,175,265 have
modelled that [[sulfate SAI]{.mark} generally [depleted the O3 column
regardless of SAI scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [modelled
[negative effect]{.mark} on the stratospheric O3 level is [consistent
with observations made following volcanic
eruptions]{.mark}]{.underline}, as discussed previously. [[A recent
modeling]{.underline}]{.mark} study by Visioni et al. (2021) and
Tilmes et al. (2022) simulated the climate impacts of sulfate SAI
against SSP5-8.5,266 a projected high GHG emission scenario (Table
1).107,179 The authors determined that changes to TCO are small (\<20
DU) compared to the base case scenario of SSP5-8.5. However, the
simulation required a continuous increase in SO2 injection.107 [The
[associated]{.mark} [risks of SAI]{.mark} like stratospheric
O3 depletion, as a result,]{.underline} may [[increase over
time]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Al2O3 particles]{.underline}]{.mark}, a potential alternative to
sulfate, [had their [impact on global O3 levels]{.mark}
explored]{.underline} by Weisenstein and co-authors (2015) via a 2-D
chemistry-transport-aerosol model.142 As seen in Fig. 9, for the range
of tested Al2O3 particle sizes, between 80 nm and 240 nm in radius,
coated or uncoated with existing aqueous sulfate in the stratosphere,
[there was [significant]{.mark} O3 depletion at middle and high
latitudes in both hemispheres]{.underline} (∼6--10%), albeit less than
that caused by sulfate. The modelled O3 loss scales inversely with the
Al2O3 particle size, with 240 nm Al2O3 particles causing the least
damage to the O3 level compared to all tested aerosol materials,
confirming that aerosol size is an important factor in designing SAI
aerosol. Although the application of Al2O3 aerosols in SAI should be
investigated more in depth in a 3-D transport model, this 2015 study
suggests that Al2O3 particles of a suitable size may be able to limit
damages to stratospheric O3 compared to sulfate. The study also modelled
the use of diamond particles, but, in addition to economic
considerations, heterogeneous reactions on diamond have not been
studied.

[[TiO2 particles]{.underline}]{.mark} were experimentally studied then
applied by Tang et al. (2014)242 in their chemistry-climate model. The
authors used a range of uptake coefficient values of N2O5 on
TiO2 particles, 0.001 to 0.005, where the lower limit was derived
experimentally and the upper limited was estimated based on
stratospheric conditions. [N2O5 [stratospheric concentration]{.mark} was
projected to [reduce by 30% in the]{.mark} [presence of stratospheric
TiO2 particles]{.mark}]{.underline} compared to ∼90% in the presence of
Pinatubo\'s level sulfate aerosols. Heterogeneous chlorine activation on
TiO2 particles has not been studied experimentally and, therefore, was
not included in the 2014 model. As a result, the impact of
TiO2 particles on stratospheric O3 is still uncertain.

#### [All life]{.underline} on Earth is [gone]{.underline} without the ozone layer

**Ho '22** \[Daniel; December 14; Bachelor of Science in Business

Associate of Science from Ohlone College; Terrapass, \"Ozone Depletion:
What Is It, and Does It Still Matter?,\"
https://terrapass.com/blog/ozone-depletion/\] NT-RS

[Can We Live Without the Ozone Layer?]{.underline}

[No. **[All life on Earth]{.mark}** as we know it **[would cease to
exist without the ozone layer]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This protective
layer keeps the full power of the sun's UV radiation from reaching the
surface of the Earth. [If this radiation reaches the Earth's
surface unimpeded, it can lead to skin cancer and cataracts. Plus, it is
very harmful on many other levels to the DNA of plants and
animals. ]{.underline}

[What Will Happen if the Ozone Layer Is Destroyed?]{.underline}

[In just days of us losing the ozone layer protection, the [radiation
from the sun]{.mark} would **[make photosynthesis]{.mark}
[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline} for plants[, [leading to]{.mark} the
[**mass extinction** of]{.mark} many [plants]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only
the largest and slowest-growing plants would survive this wave.
[Eventually]{.underline}, though, [[even]{.underline}]{.mark} these
larger and [[more resilient plants]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as some of
the largest trees in the world, [would [succumb.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} would [lead to]{.mark} the [death of]{.mark} most
[herbivores]{.mark} on the planet]{.underline}, eventually [[**choking
off the food supply** for]{.mark} [carnivores and
omnivores]{.mark}]{.underline}. This impact to the ecosystem would
eventually [[lead to]{.mark} the **[worldwide extinction]{.mark} [of all
animals]{.mark}.**]{.underline} And any [remaining animals]{.underline}
would likely [die from skin cancer]{.underline} due to the sun's harmful
radiation. 

On top of all this, [you would not be able to set foot in the sunlight
without almost instantly starting to burn,]{.underline} as the
unfiltered sunlight contacts your skin. 

Is There Still a Hole in the Ozone Layer in 2022?

While the hole in the ozone layer has shrunk over the years and
the total ozone density has increased, it remains in place as of 2022.
[The Antarctica ozone hole]{.underline} had an average size of 8.91
million miles in 2022. This sounds massive --- and it is --- but it's
[smaller than the 8.99 million square miles in 2021 and significantly
smaller than its average size at its peak in 2006.]{.underline} 

[How Does Ozone Depletion Affect Human Life?]{.underline}

Ozone depletion can have a range of effects on human life, directly and
indirectly. Most directly, ozone depletion increases the amount of [[UV
radiation]{.underline}]{.mark} that reaches the Earth's surface. This
can [[lead to]{.mark} increased skin
cancer cases]{.underline}, cataracts, [and]{.underline} even
[compromised immune systems]{.underline}. It is also believed these [UV
rays increase]{.underline} the [cases of [melanoma, the **most
deadly skin cancer**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

On a more indirect level, [[ozone depletion]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[reduce]{.mark} the yields of]{.underline} certain [crops]{.underline},
such as soybeans, [reducing our **[food supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Plus[,
[increased u]{.mark}]{.underline}ltra[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}iolet
[[radiation]{.underline}]{.mark} is also believed to [[put
**phytoplankton**]{.mark} --- the base food source in the ocean ---
[under stress]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark} can work
its way up the food chain, [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[our **food
supply from**]{.mark} **[the seas]{.mark}. **]{.underline}

Ozone loss can also impact climate change, as ozone depletion in the
lower stratosphere can create a cooling effect on the Earth.
However, ozone depletion is not viewed as a significant contributor to
overall climate change or global warming.

NT-RS

[Why has it [earned bipartisan backing]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Short answer: [It's **[good for business]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In 2020, [[during Trump's first term, Congress passed the]{.mark}
American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, or [AIM]{.mark}]{.underline},
which mandates the phasedown of HFCs and brings the U.S. in line with
the climate goals of the Kigali Amendment. Two years later, President
Joe Biden ratified Kigali with approval from the Senate, making the U.S.
the 138th country to sign on.

[The [U.S. Chamber of Commerce]{.mark} was a [leader in advancing those
policies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Our message was that [[business is working on the transition]{.mark},
it\'s going to [benefit the economy]{.mark}, it\'s going to [open up
access to markets]{.mark}, [level the playing field]{.mark} for U.S.
participation in those markets, [and the]{.mark} [economic story]{.mark}
has [continued to be]{.mark} a [good]{.mark} one]{.underline}," said
Chuck Chaitovitz, vice president of environmental affairs and
sustainability at the Chamber.

Ratification of Kigali was driven by a rare collaboration between
industry and environmental organizations. It was also pushed forward by
a bipartisan group of senators who argued that ratifying it would "help
secure America's place as a global leader" in manufacturing by offering
U.S. products an advantage in global markets.

[[Is the treaty under threat]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[**[It's unlikely that the U.S. would withdraw from the Montreal
Protocol]{.mark}**, in part [because it could hurt]{.mark} [American
businesses]{.mark}.]{.underline} The White House fiscal 2026 budget
request for EPA would continue support for provisions of the Clean Air
Act and the AIM Act that address domestic obligations to the Montreal
Protocol.

But cuts to international funding could hobble it.

"[The [U.S.]{.mark} needs to [continue]{.mark} its [domestic
implementation programs as well as their support for the international
process]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Kevin Fay, executive director of the
Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy, an industry coalition. "And
a key part of that international support is helping to promote U.S.
technology and U.S. industry and jobs around the globe."

U.S. contributions to the treaty's multilateral fund help other
countries meet their obligations under the Montreal Protocol. And when a
country like India looks for air conditioners that are made without
harmful chemicals, they often buy American-made products.

"[The multilateral fund is critical to creating markets in developing
countries for U.S. products]{.underline}," said Josh Klein, a former
senior Democratic staffer for international environmental policy on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

While the U.S. isn't the only country that contributes money to the
fund, it has provided roughly a quarter of all funding since its
establishment in 1991. The U.S. also offers experts to the protocol's
scientific advisory panel. Staffing cuts at NOAA and NASA could affect
that work.

NT-RS

What now? Trump is likely to sign the rescissions legislation soon.

Congress could choose to put money into the Montreal fund in future
spending bills. But that would be an uphill battle, at least while
Republicans are in charge.

House Republicans this week advanced their 2026 appropriations bill for
the State Department and other foreign operations, and that bill would
also zero out Montreal money. The Senate hasn't released its 2026
funding proposal for State, but that's likely to happen in the coming
weeks.

[[The U.S.]{.mark} is likely to [keep up]{.mark} its domestic
[obligations under the treaty]{.mark}, and [when State releases]{.mark}
a [report]{.mark} next month [on whether to exit]{.mark} certain
international organizations and treaties, [Montreal
will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[be safe.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But the Trump administration has shown no desire to contribute to the
international fund, and staffing cuts at NOAA and NASA could threaten
the assistance that those agencies have historically provided to the
international community on ozone-depleting emissions.

### Internal Link\-\--Phytoplankton\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Phytoplankton are the [key internal link]{.underline} to human food chain and biodiversity\-\-- UV radiation [kills them]{.underline}

**Hader 2k** \[D P Hader 1; 2000; Emeritus from Friedrich-Alexander
Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Dept. Biology; PubMed, \"Effects of solar
UV-B radiation on aquatic ecosystems,\"
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12038489/\] NT-RS

Solar UV degrades dissolved organic carbon photolytically so that they
can readily be taken up by bacterioplankton. On the other hand solar UV
radiation inhibits bacterioplankton activity. Bacterioplankton
productivity is far greater than previously thought and is comparable to
phytoplankton primary productivity. According to the \"microbial loop
hypothesis,\" bacterioplankton is seen in the center of a food web,
having a similar function to phytoplankton and protists. The penetration
of UV and PAR into the water column can be measured. Marine waters show
large temporal and regional differences in their concentrations of
dissolved and particulate absorbing substances. A network of dosimeters
(ELDONET) has been installed in Europe ranging from Abisko in Northern
Sweden to Gran Canaria. Cyanobacteria are capable of fixing atmospheric
nitrogen which is then made available to higher plants. The agricultural
potential of cyanobacteria has been recognized as a biological
fertilizer for wet soils such as in rice paddies. UV-B is known to
impair processes such as growth, survival, pigmentation, motility, as
well as the enzymes of nitrogen metabolism and CO2 fixation. [The
[marine]{.mark} [phytoplankton]{.mark} represents the **[single most
important ecosystem]{.mark}** on our planet and produces about the same
biomass as all terrestrial ecosystems taken together. It is the **[base
of the aquatic food chain]{.mark}** and [any changes in]{.mark} the size
and composition of [phytoplankton communities]{.mark} will [directly
affect food]{.mark} [production for humans]{.mark}]{.underline} from
marine sources. Another important role of marine phytoplankton is to
serve as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. [Recent
[investigations]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n a [**large sensitivity**
of]{.mark} most [phytoplankton]{.mark} organisms [toward]{.mark} solar
short-wavelength [ultraviolet radiation]{.mark}]{.underline} (UV-B);
even at ambient levels of UV-B radiation many organisms seem to be under
UV stress. Because of their requirement for solar energy, the
phytoplankton dwell in the top layers of the water column. In this
near-surface position [[phytoplankton]{.underline}]{.mark} will be
[[exposed to]{.mark} solar [u]{.mark}ltra[v]{.mark}iolet
[radiation]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [radiation]{.underline} has been
[shown to [affect **growth**, **photosynthesis**, nitrogen incorporation
and enzyme **activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other targets of solar UV
irradiation are proteins and pigments involved in photosynthesis.
Whether or not screening pigments can be induced in phytoplankton to
effectively shield the organisms from excessive UV irradiation needs to
be determined. Macroalgae show a distinct pattern of vertical
distribution in their habitat. They have developed mechanisms to
regulate their photosynthetic activity to adapt to the changing light
regime and protect themselves from excessive radiation. A broad survey
was carried out to understand photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems and
the different adaptation strategies to solar radiation of ecologically
important species of green, red and brown algae from the North Sea,
Baltic Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, polar and tropical oceans.
Photoinhibition was quantified by oxygen exchange and by PAM (pulse
amplitude modulated) fluorescence measurements based on transient
changes of chlorophyll fluorescence.

What are phytoplankton?

Phytoplankton are free-floating, microalgae, composed of two major
groups -- cyanobacteria (or blue-green algae) and single-celled algae,
mainly diatoms and dinoflagellates. [Phytoplankton inhabit the sunlit,
upper layer of most freshwater and marine environments.]{.underline}
These microscopic organisms contain chlorophyll that helps them absorb
energy from the sun. The [phytoplankton use light energy and carbon
dioxide from the air to make food]{.underline} (carbohydrates) for
themselves through photosynthesis, releasing oxygen in the process.

[Why are phytoplankton Important?]{.underline}

[[Phytoplankton are **primary producers in the food chain**]{.mark}, and
serve as food (organic matter) directly or indirectly for many
animals]{.underline} -  [[zooplankton, invertebrates, and small fish
feed on the phytoplankton]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and then those small
animals are eaten by larger ones]{.mark}.]{.underline} Phytoplankton are
major producers of oxygen in marine and freshwaters, and also our
atmosphere, producing at least half of the Earth's oxygen via
phytoplankton photosynthesis. [[By consuming carbon dioxide from the
air]{.mark} during photosynthesis, [phytoplankton]{.mark} also [**play a
key role in the carbon cycle**, helping]{.mark} to [control]{.mark} the
amount of carbon dioxide in [the atmosphere and regulate the global

[5.4. Crop yield and quality]{.underline}

[A [significant proportion of crop yield losses]{.mark} is [caused
by]{.mark} tropospheric [O3]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is a transient,
volatile, secondary air pollutant and a powerful phytotoxic compound
(Ainsworth, 2017). According to the results of several controlled
environmental and field studies, current [[O3 concentrations]{.mark} in
the environment have been found to **[negatively influence]{.mark} the
[yield and]{.mark} [quality of]{.mark} several [crop species
worldwide]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to the results of several
controlled environment and field studies ( Table 4 ). For example,
according to McGrath et al. (2015), [[**yield losses** of]{.mark} 10%
and [20%]{.mark} were **[observed in soybean and
maize]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Zea mays L.), respectively, in combination
with dry conditions and high seasonal temperatures, and 5% and 10%,
respectively, under rainfed conditions at field levels from 1980 to 2011
[[due to O3 exposure]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additionally, when two
cultivars of tropical maize were exposed to two different doses of
O3 (ambient+15 ppb and ambient+30 ppb), a reduction in the test weight
of kernel plant-1 of 6% and 10%, respectively, in DHM117, and 4% and 6%,
respectively, in HQPM1 was observed (Singh et al., 2014a). [Another
long-term investigation conducted by Sinha et al. (2015) revealed that
[**yield losses in rice, wheat, and maize** were]{.mark}
21--[26%]{.mark}, 27--[41%, and]{.mark} 3--[5%,]{.mark} respectively,
[under elevated O3]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, according to the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Special Report on Emission
Scenarios (IPCC SRES) A2 Scenario, O3-induced worldwide yield losses in
2030 will range from 5 to 26% for wheat and 4 to 9% for maize (Avnery
et al., 2011). Moreover, a recent study by Ghosh et al. (2020a) revealed
that the grain yield was reduced by 45% in wheat cv. HD 2967 under
ambient and elevated (ambient+20 ppb) O3 stress for 4 hours day−1 from 2
weeks after germination to maturity. Baqasi et al. (2018) reported a 49%
decline in grain dry mass in wheat after 50 ppb O3 exposure.
[[Ozone]{.mark} also [influences]{.mark} the [quality of crops in terms
of starch, protein, nutrients, and oil content]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, it affects grain quality by decreasing starch content and
increasing the protein and nutritional contents of crops such as wheat
and rice (Broberg et al., 2015; Frei, 2015).

[[Plants can withstand low levels of UVB radiation]{.underline}]{.mark}
by activating defense mechanisms like ROS scavengers and DNA repair
mechanisms. [The **[capacity for repair]{.mark}** may **[not be
able]{.mark}** to keep up [with]{.mark} the [high]{.mark} rate of
induction of [UVB]{.mark} damage, and these [repairing systems]{.mark}
may **[not function]{.mark}** in areas **[with high levels of UVB
radiation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as tropical areas. By inhibiting
growth and lowering the number of tillers, UVB radiation lowers rice
productivity in tropical regions of the African continent \[7,46\] and
the Bengal region \[47\]. Therefore, increasing plants\' capacity to fix
UVB-induced DNA damage through molecular methods is crucial for raising
crop productivity in tropical areas. Different approaches, such as
removing, repairing, undoing, and tolerating UVB-induced damage, have
been suggested to help plants adapt to high UVB exposure \[48\]. By
enhancing these strategies\' capacity using molecular methods, it may be
possible to increase the capacity of crops to withstand high UVB stress.
For instance, increasing the expression and copy number of the DNA
repair enzyme photolyase in rice plants can result in UVB resistance
\[\[30\], \[31\], \[32\], \[33\]\]. Although the majority of
UVB-sensitive plants, like African rice, are resistant to tissue
culture, various suggested methods for promoting regeneration and
transformation in those plants must be used to improve breeding \[49\].
For developing UVB resistance in crops, this study suggested the
following various approaches (Table 1, Fig. 1).

#### Constant UV exposure from ozone depletion means plants can't build resistance

[The [response]{.mark} of plants [to O3 stress depends on]{.mark} the
concentration and **[duration of exposure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ozone
may also be deposited in plant cells by non-stomatal channels, such as
soil and cuticular deposits, in addition to being taken up by the
stomata (Morales et al., 2021). Because stomatal opening and closing
regulate the flow of O3 into the leaves, stomata act as an initial
defense against O3 damage in plants. However, the activities of
transporters and ion channels in guard cells that move osmolytes through
the tonoplast and plasma membrane regulate the size of the stomatal
aperture. [[After accumulation in]{.mark} [plant cells, O3 induces
short-term responses]{.mark} in plants [depending on the]{.mark}
frequency of stress [exposure]{.mark},]{.underline} such as the
production of noticeable fine bronze or pale-yellow spots on the upper
surface of the leaves. However, [[**O3-induced phytotoxicity** begins
when O3 diffuses]{.mark} into the vacuolar space of the leaves through
stomatal openings, **[promoting]{.mark} oxidative [stress ]{.mark}**[by
encouraging]{.mark} the [rapid production of ROS]{.mark} in the
apoplas]{.underline}t ( Figure 2 ). Additionally, O3 can directly
diffuse into the cytosol through the cell membrane, generating ROS that
alters stomatal conductance (gs ) (Ainsworth, 2017. ) Numerous studies
have used external O3 to investigate the responses of plants to stress
in terms of growth, biomass, reproduction, and yield ( Figure 2 ).

### Impact\-\--Food Wars\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Food chain collapse causes war

Global to Local, Food Insecurity is Associated with Contemporary Armed
Conflicts",
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-016-0610-x\] NT-RS

What do these findings indicate about the variation in the risk of
conflict and civil conflict?
Firstly, [all]{.underline} [four]{.underline} [models
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [argument that
a]{.underline} **[[significant
relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}** [exists]{.underline} [between
food]{.underline} [insecurity]{.underline} [and conflict]{.underline}.
More specifically, these findings suggest that, for an average country,
the baseline risk of conflict and civil conflict increases in regions
that provide at least some access to food -- supporting the expectation
that global demands for food should generally direct conflict towards
agricultural areas. At the same time, within agricultural
areas, [conflict is intuitively more likely to arise in regions where
the levels of food per capita are low -- that is, where food supplies
are scarce]{.underline}. Secondly, and in line with previous research
(Burke et al. 2009; O'Loughlin et al. 2012; Hsiang and Meng 2014;
Hendrix and Salehyan 2012), warmer regions and areas with lower
precipitation were significantly more likely to experience conflict.
This supports the argument that food scarcity can serve, to some extent,
as a mediating factor for the effects of climate variables, in addition
to the independent impact of food insecurity related concerns on
conflict. Thirdly, as extant studies (e.g., Hegre and Sambanis 2006)
suggest, poorer regions are more likely to experience conflict, as are
more ethnically diverse regions, although it appears that higher levels
of democracy do not translate into more peace once cell level
characteristics are taken into account.3 Perhaps unsurprisingly, regions
with larger populations are more likely to experience conflict, as are
more rural regions, as some scholars have argued (Fearon and Laitin
2003; Kalyvas 2006; Buhaug et al. 2009).

In sum, four models involving different explanatory variables have been
utilized to examine two conceptualizations of conflict as an outcome of
interest. [The results strongly support extant arguments that
access]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [and availability of food are each
associated with an increased occurrence of armed conflict. This evidence
does not negate previous]{.underline} [explanations]{.underline} [of
conflict]{.underline} [that emphasize]{.underline} [the importance
of]{.underline} [political and economic development]{.underline} [or
climactic variation. However, by highlighting the strong association
between food access and availability on one hand, and local political
violence on the other, the above findings do show that these past
expositions]{.underline} (e.g. Miguel et al. 2004; Burke et al. 2009;
Hsiang and Meng 2014) [in and of
themselves]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[[insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to
fully explain the likelihood of local level conflict]{.underline}.
Simply put, the present study confirms that [there exists a systematic,
and]{.underline} [global, relationship between food
insecurity]{.underline} on one hand, [and]{.underline} the occurrence
and persistence of social [conflict]{.underline} on the other.

Discussion

What do these findings imply about the effect of food insecurity and
conflict? Naturally, even the most detailed and elaborate models are
simplistic, especially when containing as diverse a range of
observations as those examined above. Nevertheless, [in terms of
conditional probabilities, all]{.underline} [models show
**[a statistically significant]{.mark}**]{.underline} [first
difference]{.underline} [change
of]{.underline} [approximately]{.underline} **[+92
%]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [probability of
conflict]{.underline} when a high risk scenario is simulated for an
average cell.4

The conditional probabilities discussed above highlight the inherent
complexity of social systems, as a phenomenon as notable as violent
conflict ultimately arises due to a variety of stressors. Therefore, it
should be emphasized that the above findings should not be interpreted
as explaining conflict onset. Conflict can erupt due to various
political (Buhaug 2010; Fearon and Laitin 2003) or economic (Hegre and
Sambanis 2006; Collier and Hoeffler 2005) reasons -- which may or may
not be related to food insecurity -- that are beyond the scope of this
paper. Rather, the present study more simply suggests that political
violence will have a higher likelihood of concentrating in regions that
(i) offer more access to food resources and (ii) face low levels of food
availability within areas that offer some access to food resources.

This study adopts an economic perspective on food security to explain
this variation in the concentration of social conflict. From the demand
side, violent conflict is most likely to revolve primarily around access
to food sources. [When food insecurity produces
higher]{.underline} [demands for food, these demands will
directly]{.underline} [compel groups]{.underline} [and
individuals]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [seek out
and]{.underline} [fight over]{.underline} [existing
food]{.underline} [resources, rather than leading these actors to pursue
and fight over geographic areas that lack any]{.underline} (or have very
little) [agricultural resources]{.underline}. Thus, access to croplands
and food is a necessary condition for food insecurity-induced conflict,
which is confirmed in the cropland analyses presented here. From the
supply side, and within those areas that do already offer access to
agriculture and/or food, conflict is most likely to occur in regions
that offer lower levels of food availability, or insufficient food
supplies. This is because [lower food availability]{.underline} (or
supplies) in these contexts [directly implies higher levels of resource
scarcity, which can engender social grievances, and
ultimately,]{.underline} [social]{.underline} [and political
conflict]{.underline} (Brinkman and Hendrix 2011; Hendrix and Brinkman
2013). [More broadly, several causal mechanisms could plausibly link
food security and social conflict]{.underline}.

[For one, conflict in regions with higher food access and lower
availability might arise as a principal outcome of food insecurity. This
approach is most directly]{.underline} [in tune]{.underline} [with the
body
of]{.underline} [research]{.underline} [concerned]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [resource
scarcity-based security implications of climate change
(e.g.]{.underline} [Miguel]{.underline} et al.
2004; [Burke]{.underline} et al. 2009; [O'Loughlin]{.underline} et al.
2012), [as well as with broader studies of conflict dynamics and food
security in both rural and urban contexts (Brinkman and
Hendrix]{.underline} 2011; [Hendrix and
Brinkman]{.underline} 2013; [Messer and Cohen]{.underline} 2006). From
this perspective, individuals and [groups actively
fight]{.underline} with one another [due
to]{.underline} [food]{.underline} [insecurity-induced]{.underline} [grievances,
which may]{.underline} [manifest
in]{.underline} [groups']{.underline} [attempts to
overthrow]{.underline} [existing]{.underline} [political
structures]{.underline}

[, or in these actors' efforts to more directly seize and control
available (but scarce) agricultural resources]{.underline} [in an effort
to]{.underline} [better guarantee long-term food security for their
constituents. If future global]{.underline} [projections for
population]{.underline} [growth,]{.underline} [consumption, and
climate]{.underline} [change hold true, then these
dynamics]{.underline} [suggest]{.underline} [that incidences of
violent]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [over food scarcity and food
insecurity]{.underline} [may]{.underline} **[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as
individuals and groups fight over a continuously shrinking pool of
resources, including food]{.underline}.

[A second mechanism involves the existence of]{.underline} **[logistic
support]{.underline}** [in conflict-prone regions]{.underline}, or lack
thereof. Throughout history and well into the nineteenth century, armies
living off the land have been a regular characteristic of warfare. The
utilization of motorized transport vehicles and airlifts has
significantly reduced the need of modern militaries to rely on local
populations for support, at least among modernized, highly technological
militaries (Kress 2002, 12--13). However, given the bureaucratic and
economic capabilities required to maintain such systems, [the majority
of]{.underline} state and non-state [armed groups]{.underline} in the
developing world [are]{.underline} still [unlikely to be supported by
well-developed logistic supply chains]{.underline} (Henk and Rupiya
2001). Taking into account the consistent relationship between economic
welfare and conflict (Hegre and Sambanis 2006; Fearon and Laitin
2003), [unsupported]{.underline} [warring groups]{.underline} [on all
sides of a conflict may]{.underline} [move]{.underline} [into regions
that offer more access to cropland in order]{.underline} [to
forage]{.underline} [and pillage to support
themselves,]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [in
turn]{.underline} [produces]{.underline} [higher incidences
of]{.underline} [hostilities]{.underline}, especially if there is not
much food per person available within these fertile regions. Hence,
violent conflict in this case is not the direct result of food
insecurity, but rather is shaped by food insecurity concerns. [The
identified]{.underline} [**relations**hips between food security and
conflict]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [**[robust across
numerous alternative model specifications]{.mark}**,
and]{.underline} [imply an]{.underline} **[[independent
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of food insecurity in shaping conflict
dynamics and conflict risk]{.underline}. Especially when considered
alongside current, and projected, climatic and political-economic
conditions, this linkage suggests that [countries could
see]{.underline} [an increase in
localized]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} **[[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[[coming
years.]{.underline}]{.mark}** However, this anticipated trend should be
considered with caution for several key reasons.

#### Food wars go nuclear.

Although there may at first glance appear to be no close linkage between
weapons of mass destruction and food, in the twenty first century with
world resources of food, land and water under growing stress, nothing
can be ruled out. Indeed, [[chemical]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} have frequently been [deployed in]{.mark} the Syrian
civil [war, which had]{.mark} ]{.underline}drought, [ agricultural
failure and **[hunger among its early

distinct [possibility in]{.mark} South Asia and the Middle
East,]{.underline} especially, [as
these [regions]{.mark} are already **[stressed in terms
of food]{.mark}**]{.underline}, land and water, and their nuclear
firepower or access to nuclear materials is multiplying. It remains an
open question whether panicking
regimes in [[Russia]{.mark}, the [USA]{.mark} or even [France]{.mark} would be
ruthless enough to [deploy atomic weapons in]{.mark} an
[attempt to quell invasion by]{.mark} tens of millions of
desperate refugees, fleeing **[famine]{.mark}** ]{.underline}and climate
chaos [[in]{.mark} their own [homelands]{.mark}]{.underline}-- but the
possibility ought not to be ignored. That [[nuclear
war]{.mark} is]{.underline} at least [a possible **[outcome]{.mark}

#### MCB Backfires\-\--Causes Cascading Atmospheric Disruptions

cloud brightening may cool the Earth --- but could impact the ozone
layer,\"
https://cires.colorado.edu/news/marine-cloud-brightening-may-cool-earth-could-impact-ozone-layer\]

"[[MCB]{.mark}, or in fact any other troposphere-based intervention,
[isn't just affecting surface climate]{.mark}]{.underline}," said lead
author Ewa Bednarz, a CIRES researcher affiliated with NOAA\'s Chemical
Sciences Laboratory (CSL). "[We found [it could drive]{.mark} a [cascade
of]{.mark} dynamical and chemical [changes]{.mark} that could reach all
the way [into the stratosphere, affecting ozone levels]{.mark} in both
the lower and middle atmosphere]{.underline}."

Using the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), the research team started with
a high-end global warming scenario and simulated a large-scale MCB
deployment to lower temperatures to those found in a moderate global
warming scenario. The findings were surprising: [the impacts of such an
[MCB deployment changed atmospheric composition and circulatio]{.mark}n
[throughout]{.mark} the troposphere and stratosphere, which increased
ozone in some regions of the atmosphere while decreasing it in
others.]{.underline}

Winners and losers in the ozone layer

Ozone is a fundamental component of our atmosphere: in the middle
atmosphere, its presence shields living beings from harmful ultraviolet
(UV) radiation; when produced near the surface, however, often as a
byproduct of various atmospheric pollutants, it can be harmful for
humans and ecosystems.

[[In the tropics]{.mark}, the simulated [MCB]{.mark} scenario
[caused]{.mark} an [increase in]{.mark} total [ozone]{.mark}
column]{.underline} (the sum of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone)
[of [up to 5%]{.mark} due to weakened upwelling of ozone-poor air
[from]{.mark} lower, **[tropospheric]{.mark}**, altitudes [and]{.mark}
increased ozone **[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from]{.mark}
elevated nitrogen oxides ([NOx]{.mark}) produced by
[lightning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But at the same time, further north, the story was different. [[Over the
North]{.mark}ern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, [MCB led to a drop]{.mark}
in total column ozone of about 3%. This decrease was most pronounced in
winter and spring, and was driven by the MCB-induced changes in
stratospheric circulation and ozone transport.]{.underline}

The Southern Hemisphere showed a more mixed response. While MCB
decreased total column ozone in mid-latitudes during austral winter and
spring, it also surprisingly boosted ozone over Antarctica during
springtime due to changes in the polar vortex that limited the
halogen-based ozone destruction that causes the seasonal Ozone Hole.

Unexpected atmospheric chain reactions

The research highlights how a troposphere-level intervention like MCB
could trigger a cascade of atmospheric changes that extend all the way
to the middle atmosphere.

[[MCB]{.mark} could cool the surface and upper troposphere, but this in
turn [would alter wind patterns and]{.mark} affect the strength of the
large-scale stratospheric overturning [circulation]{.mark}, known as the
Brewer-Dobson Circulation.]{.underline} [[These effects]{.mark} in turn
[alter]{.mark} how [ozone and other gases]{.mark} are transported
vertically and across latitudes.]{.underline}

Adding to the complexity, the [[MCB]{.mark} strategy simulated in the
study also [triggered]{.mark} a **[La Niña-like cooling]{.mark}**
pattern [in the]{.mark} eastern [Pacific]{.mark}. That pattern [further
disrupted planetary wave activity and stratospheric transport and
mixing, as well as]{.mark} [strengthened]{.mark} the [Northern]{.mark}
Hemisphere [polar vortex]{.mark} that is known to promote ozone
depletion]{.underline}.

"[[Once you perturb the surface temperatures]{.mark}, both globally and
regionally, [it affects **the entire atmospheric system**]{.mark}," said
Bednarz. "These are not isolated layers. They are deeply
interconnected."]{.underline}\
Beyond dynamics, [[MCB also]{.mark} influenced the [chemistry of the
atmosphere]{.mark}. [Lightning activity increased]{.mark} in the model
due to changes in clouds and precipitation, [driving more]{.mark} NOx
and ozone [production in the]{.mark} tropical upper troposphere and
[lower stratosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, colder temperatures led to drier air across the troposphere
and stratosphere, which also favors ozone preservation in the tropics by
reducing water vapor-driven destruction pathways.

CLIMATEWIRE \| As treaties go, the Montreal Protocol is often considered
one of the most successful.

But the [[United States']{.mark} continued [participation]{.mark} in the
1987 agreement to save the ozone layer is suddenly [in
question]{.mark}.]{.underline}

President [Donald [Trump's]{.mark} proposed **[rescission package calls

[Protocol]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as part of a plan to claw back \$437
million appropriated for international organizations and programs during

The [[potential funding cuts coincide with]{.mark} a previously

members will discuss technical aspects of the agreement. [[The U.S. has
not confirmed]{.mark} whether [it will]{.mark} [attend]{.mark},
potentially [escalating]{.mark} the Trump [administration's policy of
snubbing]{.mark} global [environmental conferences.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The White House directed questions to the Office of Management and
Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Proponents say there is little question that the Montreal Protocol
benefits America by creating new markets for U.S. goods and protecting
people from the sun's harmful radiation.

The treaty has cut pollutants that burn holes in the ozone layer and
contribute to planetary warming. It is supported by every country ---
and American businesses, environmentalists and both political parties.

But **[[budget cuts that would deprive the treaty of

[Utah Sen. Mike Lee asked [Secretary of State Marco Rubio]{.mark} to
[consider **withdrawing from the Montreal**]{.mark}
**[Protocol]{.mark},**]{.underline} which requires countries to phase
out the consumption and production of "ozone-depleting substances."

Attached to the letter addressed to Rubio, [Lee wrote]{.underline} on
Wednesday afternoon, "[[America shouldn't tie itself to]{.mark}
unscientific environmental [treaties that]{.mark} allow China to do
whatever it wants. I have asked \@SecRubio to withdraw the United States
from the Montreal Protocol]{.underline}."

In the letter's text, Lee mentions several concerns over the continued
participation of the U.S. in the program.

Is [the Montreal Protocol]{.underline} outdated or [[unfair toward the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}?

One particular substance the protocol seeks to decrease is
hydrochlorofluorocarbon, or HCFC, which is "essential for everything
from refrigerants to fire suppression," Lee wrote.

Lee added that when the treaty was signed in the late 1980s, scientists
hadn't yet tried using HCFCs for fire suppression.

The second concern Lee touched on is inequality between participating
countries. [[The U.S. has]{.mark} adhered to the treaty, Lee said, but
**other countries have failed to do the same**.]{.underline}

The Montreal Protocol determines what is expected of countries in the
program based on whether they are deemed "developing" or "developed[."
Developed countries have [stricter timelines]{.mark} required to phase
out ozone-depleting substances, [must contribute financially]{.mark} to
help developing countries do the same [and follow stricter regulatory
systems]{.mark} to enforce bans on ozone-depleting
substances.]{.underline}

[[Developing countries have delayed timelines]{.underline}]{.mark} to
phase out ozone-depleting substances, [[receive financial and]{.mark}
[technical assistance, and are allowed more
flexibility]{.mark}]{.underline} while transitioning to alternative
substances.

China is included in the Montreal Protocol as a developing country. At a
Montreal Protocol meeting in 2023, the State Department "proposed the

#### Geoengineering includes the injection of calcite aerosols\-\--mitigates the impact from other aerosols

Abstract

[[Injecting sulfate aerosol into the stratosphere]{.underline}]{.mark},
the most frequently analyzed proposal for solar geoengineering, may
reduce some climate risks, but it [would also [entail]{.mark} new
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, including ozone loss and heating of the
lower tropical stratosphere, which, in turn, would increase water vapor
concentration causing additional ozone loss and surface warming. We
propose a method for stratospheric aerosol climate modification that
uses a solid aerosol composed of alkaline metal salts that will convert
hydrogen halides and nitric and sulfuric acids into stable salts to
enable stratospheric geoengineering while reducing or reversing ozone
depletion. Rather than minimizing reactive effects by reducing surface
area using high refractive index materials, this method tailors the
chemical reactivity. Specifically, we calculate that [[injection]{.mark}
[of calcite]{.mark} (CaCO3) [aerosol]{.mark}]{.underline} particles
might [[reduce net radiative forcing while simultaneously increasing
column ozone toward its]{.mark} preanthropogenic
[baseline]{.mark}]{.underline}. A radiative forcing of −1 W⋅m−2, for
example, might be achieved with a simultaneous 3.8% increase in column
ozone using 2.1 Tg⋅y−1 of 275-nm radius calcite aerosol. Moreover, the
radiative heating of the lower stratosphere would be roughly 10-fold
less than if that same radiative forcing had been produced using sulfate
aerosol. Although solar geoengineering cannot substitute for emissions
cuts, it may supplement them by reducing some of the risks of climate
change. Further research on this and similar methods could lead to
reductions in risks and improved efficacy of solar geoengineering
methods.

NT-RS

[[The majority]{.mark} of tiny marine plants [weathered]{.mark} the
[abrupt climate changes]{.mark} that occurred in Earth\'s past [and
**bounced back**]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a Penn State
geoscientist. [\"Populations of [plankton]{.mark} [are]{.mark} pretty
[resilient]{.mark},\"]{.underline} says Dr. Timothy J. Bralower, head
and professor of geoscience. Bralower looked at cores of marine
sediments related to thousands of years of deposition, to locate
populations of these plankton during three periods of abrupt climate
change. These abrupt changes were caused either by Oceanic Anoxic Events
during the middle Jurassic to late Cretaceous when the oceans became
uniformly depleted of oxygen or by a warming event in the early
Paleocene around 55 million years ago. Marine sediment cores contain
calcareous plankton \-- single-celled organisms with a coating or shell
of calcium carbonate \-- as fossils. These tiny photosynthesizing plants
float in the ocean and move with the currents. They are around 10
micrometers in size, about half the width of a human hair. Anything
bigger than phytoplankton eat them. Eventually, their calcium carbonate
shell falls to the ocean floor to become part of the sediment. [The
[factors]{.mark} that were [altered in the upper marine environment
during]{.mark} the [abrupt climate change events included increases in
temperature]{.mark} and [changes in thermal structure]{.mark}, changes
in [salinity]{.mark} and [alkalinity]{.mark}, and changes in [nutrient
patterns and trace elements]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"In every case,
changes in surface habitats resulted in transient plankton
communities,\" Bralower told attendees at the 2006 annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. \"Although we have
a poor understanding of ancient plankton ecology, [it appears that
[extinctions were selective]{.mark} and [targeted more]{.mark}
specialized and often **[deep]{.mark}er-[dwelling
species]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} For example, about 55 million years
ago there was a warming event that geologists call the Paleocene/Eocene
thermal maximum. During that time, there were mass extinctions of
organisms living on the ocean floor, but surface phytoplankton
populations dipped and for the most part came back. During this event
one genus of phytoplankton - Fasciculithus \-- which had about five
species went extinct. \"We do not have anything like Fasciculitus in the
oceans today,\" says Bralower. \"But, these organisms were probably
highly specialized and existed in a very narrow ecological niche. The
other thing is that, as soon as some group disappears, another species
comes in to occupy that niche.\" About 120 million years ago, during an
episode of oxygen depletion another genus inhabiting surface waters \--
Nannococus \-- which also had about five species, went extinct.
Otherwise only a few species here and there were unable to survive these
abrupt changes. However, on the ocean floor during these same times,
mass extinctions occurred. Other extinctions, such as that at the
Cetaceous Tertiary boundary (K/T) that caused the demise of the
dinosaurs, are thought to be caused by other than abrupt climate
changes. The K/T event had mass extinctions on land and in the upper
portions of the oceans, but not on the ocean floors. During the abrupt
climate changes that Bralower investigated, the temperature of the
oceans changed about 11 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of 1,000
years. \"This rate of change in ocean temperature is probably slower
than what is happening today in the oceans,\" the Penn State researcher
adds. \"We are not yet seeing the same effect in today\'s
phytoplankton.\" Besides being a major food source, phytoplankton are
also important in the balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as
opposed to the carbon that is sequestered in the ocean sediment.
Photosynthesizing organisms use carbon dioxide to create energy and so
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some of the carbon that
phytoplankton take out of the air as carbon dioxide is used to make
their calcium carbonate coatings. Because these coatings eventually make
it into the sediment, they do not immediately return to the atmosphere.
It is not until chalk or limestone beds are exposed to the elements that
weathering returns the carbon to the atmosphere. \"Today, we are sort of
in the middle of a mass experiment,\" says Bralower. [\"With the oceans
warming, we do not really know what the end result will be, but we can
look to the fossil record to see how they were affected in the past. It
appears that [abrupt climate change affects plankton]{.mark} with
[selectivity and most]{.mark} of the organisms [bounce right
back]{.mark} after the change.\"]{.underline}

Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation has a wavelength range of 280--315 nm.
[[Plants perceive UV-B]{.mark} [as an environmental signal]{.mark} and a

acclimation.]{.underline} UV-B regulates photomorphogenesis including
hypocotyl elongation inhibition, cotyledon expansion, and flavonoid
accumulation, but high intensity UV-B can also harm plants by damaging
DNA, triggering accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and impairing
photosynthesis. [**[Plants have]{.mark} evolved ["sunscreen"]{.mark}**
flavonoids [that a**ccumulate under UV-B**]{.mark} **stress [to

receptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) plays a critical role in promoting
flavonoid biosynthesis to enhance UV-B stress tolerance. [[Recent

It is perhaps surprising, then, [that there is [little]{.mark} scholarly
[merit in the notion that]{.mark} a short-term reduction in access to
[food increases]{.mark} the probability that [conflict]{.mark} will
break out.]{.underline} This is [because to start or participate in

the best opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills to

Accordingly, there is a widespread misapprehension that social unrest in

[[risk land and resource grabs,]{.mark}]{.underline} such as with

[The [Human Rights Council\'s Advisory Committee has warned]{.mark} that
the [deployment]{.mark} of geoengineering technologies has the potential
to [violate]{.mark} the [human rights of]{.mark} \"millions and perhaps
[billions of people]{.mark},\"]{.underline} with a disproportionate
impact on Indigenous Peoples, traditional communities, peasants, and
fisher folks, among other groups. 145 Furthermore, the Committee notes
geoengineering technologies:

\"[cause social risks]{.mark}, including for future genera-tions\...
Exposure to the effects on land is greater for frontline communities,
including Indigenous Peoples, local communities, peasants, fisherfolk,
rural women and other persons working in rural areas.\" \"
Geoengineering \"would have a massive and disproportionate impact on
Indigenous Peoples whose traditional lands and territories are
particularly exposed and at risk of experimental uses.\"147

Due to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, these
techniques may [negatively impact Indigenous Peoples\' cultural and
spiritual values]{.mark} of natural areas, sacred groves, and water
shades. 148 Harm to biodiversity from these speculative technologies may
also lead to a loss of traditional knowledge, further decreasing
Indigenous Peoples\' resilience to climate and ecosystem changes.

Local communities are likely to experience similar cultural and economic
losses - especially at the regional level - due to geoengineering\'s
potential harms to biodiversity.\* 149 For these reasons, CBD COP1O
Decision X/33 calls for integrating the views and experiences of
Indigenous Peoples and local communities and stakeholders into weighing
the possible impacts of geoengineering on biodiversity and related
social, economic, and cultural considerations 150 The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also warned of the adverse
socioeconomic impacts that many geoengineering technologies could have,
including [hinder]{.mark}ing [sustainable development]{.mark}. The
social, economic, and cultural [impacts]{.mark} of geoengineering would
likely [become apparent only once deployed]{.mark}. 152

[[Geoengineering]{.mark} will likely [support]{.mark} the [continuation
of inequitable political and social power]{.mark}, [entrenching
neocolonialism and undermining]{.mark} transformative, justice-centered
[solutions to]{.mark} the climate [crisis]{.mark}. [Solar
geoengineering]{.mark} [research]{.mark} is primarily being advanced [by
a small Global North elite]{.mark}, funded by billionaires and
billionaire philanthropy, with an emerging consensus that the likely
[actors for deployment would be **limited to**]{.mark} **a [handful of
major powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, assumptions about
militarization are built into prominent deployment scenarios. 153
Meanwhile, [[terrestrial and marine-based geoengineering]{.mark}
technologies would [perpetuate]{.mark} [neocolonialism]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} land and ocean [grabs]{.mark}, which would
[violate]{.mark} the [inherent rights]{.mark}]{.underline} of Indigenous
Peoples, peasants, fisherfolks, and rural communi-ties. 154 The
potential detrimental biodiversity impacts and their human rights

\"sacrifice zones\"]{.mark} that [allow]{.mark} for the [further]{.mark}
[entrenchment of]{.mark} the [fossil economy and its harms]{.mark} at
the expense of those most vulnerable to the climate crisis.

It is worth noting, too, that geoengineering social science
[analysis]{.mark} [primarily]{.mark} includes perceptions [from]{.mark}
the [USA and Europe]{.mark}, which likely **[[creates]{.mark} a

[[An essential characteristic of a weapon is precision]{.mark}.2 To be
effective, a weapon must be capable of producing a specific destructive
or disruptive effect, at a specific time and place. ]{.underline}

[[Imprecise targeting]{.mark} can [lead to]{.mark} unpredictable and
undesirable results like excessive collateral damage, "[friendly
fire"]{.mark} incidents[, or mistaken strikes]{.mark}.]{.underline} One
reason armies rarely use chemical weapons is because they are difficult
to control -- once released into the air, poison gas drifts wherever the
wind takes it, which can include over friendly troops. 

Uncertain timing can also undermine the dependability of weapons. Among
the reasons militaries avoid using biological weapons is that their
effects may take days or weeks to materialise. Infections, diseases, and
illnesses spread at different speeds along unpredictable trajectories
that are difficult to match to changing battlefield conditions. 

And unexpected outcomes can compromise usefulness. One of the reasons
the United States stopped using herbicides like Agent Orange during the
Vietnam War was due to their unforeseen side effects -- in addition to
defoliating jungles, these chemicals also resulted in widespread health
problems.

Stratospheric aerosol injection -- too imprecise 

SAI would involve releasing tiny particles in the upper atmosphere to
reflect a small fraction of incoming sunlight and reduce temperatures[.
The climate effects of **[SAI]{.mark}** have been studied in some depth
and it is clear that it **[would be]{.mark}** **[imprecise]{.mark}** in
space, in time, and [in its]{.mark} potentially [destructive
effects]{.mark}.3]{.underline} 

[Aerosols (tiny reflective particles) released as part of an
[SAI]{.mark} intervention [would not stay fixed]{.mark} in place, but
instead would quickly encircle the planet [and drift toward the
poles]{.mark}.4 [Any attempt to target a single country]{.mark} or group
of countries [would]{.mark} end up [affect]{.mark}ing [all]{.mark}
countries -- enemies and allies alike -- [as well as whichever state
used SAI.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[The fact that SAI aerosols would persist in the atmosphere for one to
two years means that shorter interventions would not be possible.4 It
also means that an [intervention would continue]{.mark} for [one to two
years following]{.mark} a decision to [halt]{.mark} it. ]{.underline}

[[SAI effects]{.mark} themselves would have [uncertain]{.mark}
consequences.]{.underline} SAI would affect the climate -- long-term
temperature and rainfall trends [-- but, [due to the long timescale
and]{.mark} large spatial [scale]{.mark} of the intervention, [it
**would not allow for control**]{.mark} [over specific weather
events]{.mark}.3 This means that if SAI were able to increase the
likelihood of flooding in a target region, it would not lead to the
predictable occurrence of a specific flood, let alone particular flood
impacts (like making specific routes impassable) that an attacker could
count on to help it in a conflict. ]{.underline}

[In sum, the [inability to pinpoint targets]{.mark}, [complete
strikes]{.mark} over short periods, [and inflict damage]{.mark} in a

Among those advocating for geoengineering research, how are they
conceptualizing social justice and social change?

Given the power and influence of who is currently conducting and funding
solar geoengineering research, it is important to consider how they are
conceptualizing social justice and social change. What kinds of futures
do these researchers envision in their models and scenarios? [[Solar
geoengineering is]{.underline}]{.mark} often [considered a [mechanism to
reduce climate vulnerabilities while 'buying time' for mitigation
measures]{.mark} to scale up and energy transformations to
occur]{.underline} (Surprise, 2018[). [If a potentially dangerous,
planetary-scale intervention is being advocated to 'buy
time']{.mark}]{.underline} for other solutions, [[it is important to
consider how]{.mark} solar geoengineering [researchers envision current
global injustices and future social change, including]{.mark} the
[potential for]{.mark} political and [economic
shifts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the research community is not
uniform, few solar geoengineering researchers appear to be advocating
strongly for urgent and transformative climate policy. Several
influential researchers in the field have expressed alignment with
moderate approaches centred on a mix of incremental market mechanisms,
policy prescriptions and technological innovations (e.g., Horton et al.,
2016; Keith, 2013; Wagner & Weitzman, 2015). Moderation and
incrementalism keep the core structures of political and economic power
in place.

Indeed, [[solar geoeng]{.mark}ineering [may appeal to]{.mark} many
wealthy climate [philanthropists]{.mark} explicitly [because it offers
an alt]{.mark}]{.underline}ernative [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[growing recognition that responding to climate]{.mark} change [will
require transformative measures that directly challenge]{.mark}
free-market [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Foster et al., 2011;
Klein, 2014; Wainwright & Mann, 2018). The idea that confronting climate
change demands a rapid, just and fundamental transformation away from
our current fossil fuel- dominated capitalist political economies that
are concentrating wealth and power seems to be untenable to many wealthy
individuals, corporations and elite technocratic managers that profit
from current systems that perpetuate inequities (Kenner, 2019; Lynch et
al., 2019). [[For those]{.underline}]{.mark} that feel [[threatened
by]{.mark} the call for [radical]{.mark}]{.underline}, social, political
and economic [[change, technological solutions]{.underline}]{.mark},
market mechanisms and moderate policies [[are appealing, even though
they are **inadequate responses** to the scale of the emergent climate
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} (Huber, 2019). By investing in extreme
technical solutions to climate change, [those advocating for solar
geoengineering research are avoiding extreme (and necessary) social
changes that are rapidly gaining political traction.]{.underline}

As to the 'humanitarian' social justice rationale, [[we have already
questioned]{.mark} the [ethical implications of a small group of
privileged researchers]{.mark} from]{.underline} wealthy and [powerful
institutions [propagating dangerous techno-fixes in the name of the
global poor. Another problematic aspect]{.mark} of this [relates to who
gets to declare when the climate crisis is bad enough to justify]{.mark}
SAI [deployment.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Climate change is already
causing extreme sufferin]{.mark}g]{.underline} for millions of people
around the world, [[but]{.mark} most]{.underline} solar geoengineering
[[researchers are not yet advocating for
deployment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most solar geoengineering models do not
anticipate deployment in the next decade, so [those advocating for solar
geoengineering research seem to be more concerned about future rather
than current climate impacts and]{.underline} climate
[injustices]{.underline}. [[Emergencies are not]{.underline}]{.mark}
merely [[objective]{.underline}]{.mark} circumstances -- they are
determined by political calculations and power dynamics (Agamben, 2005;
Schmitt, 2005; Sillmann et al., 2015). [[Who will decide when conditions
are bad enough to declare a planetary-scale emergency justifying
intervention]{.mark} in the climate system? It is [unlikely to be poor
countries,]{.mark}]{.underline} vulnerable populations [[or
the]{.underline}]{.mark} hundreds of millions -- if not
[[billions]{.underline}]{.mark} -- of people [[already living in
'emergency' conditions of poverty and climate
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ehrenreich, 2019; Tahir, 2019).
Solar geoengineering research diverts attention and funding away from
immediate systemic changes that could meaningfully address current
inequalities and injustices.

[The [primary political effect of advancing]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark} research [is]{.mark}]{.underline}, therefore,
[[to blunt the]{.mark} urgent, [transformative proposals emanating from
the climate justice movement]{.mark}]{.underline}. In so doing, [solar
geoengineering research -- independent of the desires of individual
researchers -- [maintains]{.mark} contemporary systems of power, which
we define as systems of [colonial capitalism that thrive on fossil fuels
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the perpetuation of [[inequality, exploitation
and domination]{.underline}]{.mark} buttressed by patriarchal white
supremacy (Faber et al., 2017; Federici, 2004; Pulido, 2016; Watts,
2006; Whyte, 2016).

#### Indigenous organizations oppose geoengineering research because it's a distraction from emission cuts

Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

From a humanitarian perspective, indigenous peoples are amongst those
most vulnerable to climate change. The impacts of climate change on
indigenous peoples are global but take different forms in different
regions, ranging from pacific islanders risking displacement by rising
sea levels (Voyatzis-Bouillard and Kelman, 2021), to pastoralists in the
Sahel suffering the consequences of droughts and land (Dieng, 2021) and
the myriad negative effects unpredictable weather conditions have on
people living close to nature (Jones, 2019; Schramm et al., 2020). The
Sámi people, who inhabit northern Fennoscandia and the Russian Kola
peninsula have also experienced adverse effects of climate change, with
mid-winter thaws resulting in icy snows blocking access to reindeer
pastures, forcing Sámi reindeer herders to resort to costly emergency
fodder, and unpredictable weather conditions complicating seasonal herd
migrations (personal correspondence with Sámi reindeer herders).
[[Geoengineering advocates]{.mark} could therefore [expect]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} the Sámi, along with other [indigenous peoples]{.mark},
[may be in favor of geoengineering research]{.mark} that could generate
knowledge with the potential for drastically mitigating or even
reversing global warming. [However, there has been declared opposition
from indigenous organizations through statements like the Anchorage
Declaration]{.mark}. [The Sámi have recently joined ranks]{.mark} [with
indigenous peoples opposing geoengineering research through the Sámi
Council\'s open letters demanding the cancellation of the planned test
flight for Harvard University\'s SCoPEx
project]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which had been scheduled for June
2021 on Sámi domicile lands in Giron/Kiruna (northern Sweden) and the
halting of the project altogether. The SCoPEx project aims to explore
some of the potential side-effects of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection
(SAI) as a way of cooling the planet\'s temperature by reflecting more
sunlight (Low et al., 2022, p. 5). [[Rather than embracing]{.mark} the
concept of [geoengineering]{.mark} as a potential solution for averting
climate disaster, [most indigenous organizations engaged in the question
have rejected it as a distraction from measures necessary to curb
climate change, like emission cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} (The Anchorage
Declaration, 2009).

#### Empirically Geoengineering research projects exclude indigenous input

Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

From the webinar and the other publicly available information, we can
see that there was coordination between the Sámi Council and HOME member
organizations---specifically the Indigenous Environmental Network, the
ETC Group, and the Heinrich Böll Foundation---in their opposition to the
SCoPEx project\'s planned Giron/Kiruna test flight. The Sámi Council\'s
open letter,1 dated 24.02.2021, addressed to the SSC, the Swedish
Government and the SCoPEx Advisory Committee was preceded by a letter
sent weeks earlier to the SSC and the Swedish government, co-signed by
three aforementioned organizations, Greenpeace Sweden, Friends of the
Earth Sweden, Friends of the Earth International and others. [There are
clear similarities between the [letters]{.mark} as both [highlights the
unpredictability of SAI technology with potential for extreme
consequences]{.mark}, the danger of [a termination shock]{.mark}, of it
[deflating pressure to transition to carbon neutrality]{.mark}, and the
[lack of]{.mark} both Swedish [representation and consultation with
affected indigenous populations]{.mark} as required by
UNDRIP]{.underline} (2007) (Open Letter to the SSC and Swedish
Government by Greenpeace Sweden, Jordens Vänner/Friends of the Earth
Sweden, Naturskyddsföreningen/Swedish Society for Nature Conservation
(SSNC), Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC
Group), Biofuelwatch, Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL),
Climate Justice Alliance (CJA), Friend of the Earth International,
Heinrich Böll Foundation, Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN),
WhatNext? (2020); Open Letter to the SCoPEx Advisory Committee by the
Sámi Council Open Letter to the SCoPEx Advisory Committee (2021). [[The
Sámi Council\'s letter also raises]{.mark} further [objections toward
**the homogenous composition of the**]{.mark} **SCoPEx [Advisory
Committee]{.mark}**, [consisting almost entirely of US citizens]{.mark}
and/or residents, [and its approach to research ethics]{.mark} as
expressed in the draft "Engagement Process for SCoPEx," [which states
that no research project should have to answer questions pertaining to
the potential moral hazard of geoengineering deployment and surrounding
decision making and **governance issues**]{.mark}. [The letter
argues]{.mark} "that precisely because of the extraordinary and
particular risks associated with [SAI]{.mark}, this technology and
SCoPEx **[cannot be treated like other research]{.mark}**." The letter
concludes by stating that [research]{.mark} along the lines of SCoPEx
[cannot be carried out before concerns]{.mark} such as those raised in
the letter [have been addressed]{.mark} and full global consensus on its
acceptability has been reached.]{.underline}

The close partnership that formed between the HOME coalition,
represented by the ETC Group, Heinrich Böll Foundation, and the
Indigenous Environmental Network, and the Sámi Council in articulating
their opposition to the aims of the SCoPEx project can be further
discerned from the webinar co-hosted by these organizations live
streamed through the ETC Group\'s Facebook page on June 6th, 2021 (ETC
Group\'s Facebook Page, 2021). The normative influence of the Sámi
Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx project can be seen from how
the webinar drew the participation of the global influencers in the
climate change debate of Naomi Klein, Vandana Shiva, Bill McKibben and
Greta Thunberg in solidarity with the Sámi people. The rhetoric of the
webinar contributors shows the discursive nodal points that formed the
chains of equivalency within this diverse group and how this was posited
in antagonistic opposition to what the SCoPEx project was seen to
represent.

Vice President, Åsa Larsson Blind represented the Sámi Council at the
webinar[. In her opening statement, she said that [the Sámi Council had
been unaware of the SCoPEx project and the larger question of
geoengineering]{.mark}, and was alerted to SCoPEx\'s planned activities
in Giron/Kiruna in February 2021 by Tom Goldtooth of the Indigenous
Environmental Network and the ETC Group]{.underline}. This triggered
what Larsson Blind described as an "instinctive" response by the Sámi
Council as expressed in the open letter:

#### Geoengineering is the same worldview of master over nature that got us into the climate crisis in the first place -- Turns case

Aslak-Antti **Oksanen** 20**23**, (Senior Lecturer at the University of
Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

"We reacted quite instinctively when we learned what the idea of solar
geoengineering is, and what they are attempting to do. [We reacted
instinctively, because this goes against our world view, that we as
humans should live and adapt to nature, and [it is against the respect
with which we are taught to treat nature and mother earth]{.mark}. [And
it is the whole]{.mark} idea that the [line of thought that has put us
in the climate crisis in the first place]{.mark} should also be the one
thing taking us out of it. And there our position is clear, that [now is
the time for all society to listen to what mother earth is telling
us]{.mark} and nature is telling us now. Our focus should be on finding
a way to a sustainable climate-friendly society]{.underline}. And this
is why we have reacted... together with other organizations and allies,
with the result of the cancellation of the test in Giron."

In Blind\'s statement, we can see the first discursive nodal point, [of
[a world view of living in harmony with mother earth]{.mark}, which [is
posited in opposition to **technological manipulation** of nature
through]{.mark} solar [geoengineering]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Blind went on to state a quite categorical opposition to solar
geoengineering, and that the Sámi Council was working to broaden
indigenous opposition to it:

"But now that we have engaged ourselves in the issue, our position is
clear, that this technology of solar geoengineering, that is not a part
of our chosen future. So, this is also why we have taken the initiative
to gather indigenous peoples from around the world in a joint letter to
Harvard University, urging them to put a stop to the SCoPEx project.
[And the message [in this letter]{.mark}, is that [we as indigenous
peoples do not approve of the legitimizing development toward]{.mark}
solar [geoengineering]{.mark} [and nor for it to be conducted in or
above our lands or territories and skies, nor in any ecosystem
anywhere]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The central discursive nodal point of the opposition between the
extractive, mechanistic mastery over nature mentality and its
technological solutions to climate change, and respect for the sanctity
of Mother Earth and nature-based solutions also came through strongly in
Vandana Shiva\'s contribution. Shiva is a physicist who founded the
Research Foundation for Science, Technology, and Natural Resource Policy
(RFSTN), author of numerous books, including Ecofeminism, Gates to a
Global Empire and We Feed the World, and a social and environmental
activist. [Her contribution began with stressing how the idea of [SAI
was expressive of the mistaken assumption that control and mastery over
nature is possible and desirable]{.mark}:]{.underline}

["You are [adding pollution to the existing pollution]{.mark}, creating
the same instability. Pollution for a pollution problem; [deliberate
climate change as a solution to climate change is]{.mark} not just
[insane]{.mark}, but [it is]{.mark}, as Einstein said, [repeating the
mindset that got you into the crisis in the first place]{.mark}. And
what is that mindset? [A mechanistic worldview. The idea of mastery and
control, of engineering a solution for everything
living]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### Pro-geoengineering "science" is fraught with [conflict of interests]{.underline} from [capitalists]{.underline} who benefit from backing a ["techno-fix"]{.underline}

Aslak-Antti **Oksanen** 20**23**, (Senior Lecturer at the University of
Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

[[Naomi Klein]{.mark}, author of numerous influential books like No
Logo, Shock Doctrine and This Changes Everything and a social and
environmental activist, identified a tangible antagonist to mobilize
against by focusing on the capitalist interests backing a technological
solution to climate change, [term]{.mark}ing a small number of
[geoengineering advocating scientists and their billionaire backers the
"geo clique]{.mark}."]{.underline} She focused particularly on the role
of SCoPEx\'s lead scientist David Keith, and his relation to Bill Gates
and the Alberta Tar Sands bitumen extraction financer Murrey Edwards,
who were the initial financial backers for Keith\'s Alberta Tar Sands
based carbon capture company Carbon Engineering:

"This is significant, because, David Keith is in business, with Tar
Sands companies. His private company, which is an air capture company
called Carbon Engineering... [There are [all these conflicts of interest
that these scientists who are pushing this \[technological solutions\]
most aggressively, have their own private companies, which benefit from
the normalization of the idea of a techno-fix]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Klein\'s focus on Keith\'s entrepreneurship [highlights how the lines
between capitalists backing geoengineering and the scientists advocating
for it get blurred]{.mark} when the scientists operate on both sides of
the money and know-how equation]{.underline}. Discursively, this serves
to homogenize the scientists and their financial backers, and
particularly those vested in the fossil fuel industry into the "geo
clique," providing a clear opponent to mobilize activists\' energies
against. [Klein further elaborated on the internal dynamics of the "geo
clique," and how [scientists]{.mark} like David Keith [provide moral
cover the continued wealth accumulation for fossil fuel magnates]{.mark}
like Murrey Edwards]{.underline}:

#### Geoengineering reproduces colonial terra nullius logic when they find "empty" places to experiment

Aslak-Antti **Oksanen** 20**23**, (Senior Lecturer at the University of
Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

[Klein also supplanted the discursive nodal point of
[geoengineering]{.mark} being [represent]{.mark}ative of a [mastery over
nature]{.mark} mentality with how geoengineering projects and their
[funders reproduced a colonial terra nullius logic in their preference
for finding remote sparsely populated areas for conducting outdoor
experiments]{.mark}. As a prior example of such terra nullius predatory
logic, she raised the [example of the ocean fertilization experiment at
Haida Gwaii]{.mark} and how it was carried out by a "rogue
[geoengineering entrepreneur]{.mark} \[Russ George\], who [was selling
this false promise of carbon credits for the Haida\'s protection of
their forest, if they allowed him to dump a whole bunch of iron filings
in the ocean."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Klein concluded by affirming the discursive battle lines between
[geoengineering]{.mark} [represent]{.mark}ing [extractive capitalist
coloniality]{.mark}, and those seeking to live in harmony with
nature]{.underline}, by connecting David Keith\'s involvement with
carbon storage in the Alberta Tar Sands, [with indigenous resistance
toward the pipeline to the USA, including the blockade against the
pipeline that Tom Goldtooth was attending at the time of the
webinar.]{.underline}

Tom Goldtooth, founder and executive director of the Indigenous
Environmental Network and ETC Group board member, joined the webinar
late, having driven directly from an indigenous-led blockade against the
planned routing of an oil pipeline from the Alberta Tar Sands beneath
the Mississippi River in Minnesota. [[This further reinforced the
framing of extractive, fossil fuel driven capitalism and technological
solutions to the climate crisis against the alternative of respect for
Mother Earth and nature-based solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Goldtooth
had prior experience with organizing indigenous resistance against a
prior planned SCoPEx test flight in Arizona:

"[[SCoPEx]{.mark} [was presented]{.mark} as a proposed initiative, in
the United States, in the southwest a number of years ago]{.underline},
[in the Tucson Arizona region, and when we found out, we immediately
contacted the [tribe of the Yaqui]{.mark}... who live south of Tucson,
and they consulted with their spiritual leaders, I talked with them as
well. And they [were]{.mark} just like [appalled.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

Goldtooth connected indigenous opposition to geoengineering research to
the longstanding discursive nodal point of indigenous peoples\' right to
give or withhold consent on projects affecting them under the UNDRIP,
which is nestled within the wider nodal point of the UN\'s broader human
rights agenda as demonstrated in the prior section:

"So, lack of consultation is a big concern with our indigenous peoples.
**[We found that out with the Sámi, we found that out in Tucson. [This
project, they are keeping it secret.]{.mark} I don\'t know what they
have to hide,]{.underline}** but under international standards, under
the tool of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, our
indigenous peoples, in every region we reside, including Sweden, have a
right to the provision of free, prior and informed consent, and the
right to give their consent to these kinds of projects."

#### Geoengineering research is funded by the rich and the positive results will only go to the rich -- excluding the global south and indigenous people

Aslak-Antti **Oksanen** 20**23**, (Senior Lecturer at the University of
Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

Bill McKibben, author of books like The End of Nature and Falter, and
co-founder of the environmental organization 350.org, spoke along
similar lines to Klein, [reinforcing the discursive nodal point of
[geoengineering]{.mark} being [a preoccupation of billionaires
benefitting from the extractivist status quo]{.mark}. He
[divided]{.mark} the [billionaires into two camps]{.mark}: [those who
sought to escape the planet]{.mark} altogether [and those who sought a
technological fix]{.mark} to the climate crisis, **[both of which
distract from]{.mark} the urgent task of [decarbonising]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} global [economy]{.mark}:**]{.underline}

["[Bill Gates]{.mark}, who [did the original funding for much of this
research]{.mark}, is of the stay at home and come up with some
technological miracles, to avoid having to do the real work ahead of us,
which is to get off the coal and gas and oil and replace it with sun and
wind and conservation and efficiency... [Our job is to keep insisting
that we have to move fast, that Jeff Bezos aside, there is no planet B,
and we are not going to someplace else]{.mark}.... This is really an
incredibly beautiful planet, the only one that we know of that supports
life, and our job is to figure out how to get it back to the state that
we know works."]{.underline}

Youth climate activist Greta Thunberg\'s contribution also centered on
the discursive nodal point of how the concept of geoengineering was
expressive of the same mastery over nature mindset that created the
crisis:

["**[When you are in a hole, stop digging]{.mark}**. [We cannot move out
of this crisis with the same mindset that got us into this]{.mark}. [We
got into this mess by thinking we could control nature]{.mark}, by
thinking we can manipulate and thinking we are above nature.... We
simply do not know how the earth will respond to this mechanism, if we
set these things going."]{.underline}

[Thunberg\'s reflections on the problems with who would control
geoengineering once it started also affirmed the framing an antagonistic
relation between the [beneficiaries]{.mark} of the status quo and those
disadvantaged by it:]{.underline}

["It is [probably going to be the high-income countries and the richest
people]{.mark}. And [we will do things that benefit us]{.mark}, and
perhaps even [at the expense of]{.mark} other people. Unfortunately,
that is most often the peoples living in [the Global South and the
indigenous peoples around the world]{.mark}. [They are always going to
suffer]{.mark} from these kinds of decisions. And [that is the exact
opposite of climate justice]{.mark}, and environmental justice, and
social justice. [It\'s like we are trying to do everything we possibly
can to avoid reducing emissions... Even manipulating nature,
manipulating the sky]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### Indigenous people must be a part of a sustainable solution and geoengineering isn't compatible with that equation

Aslak-Antti **Oksanen** 20**23**, (Senior Lecturer at the University of
Bristol), Frontiers in Climate, 20 Feb 2023, "Dimming the midnight sun?
Implications of the Sámi Council\'s intervention against the SCoPEx
project" https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2023.994193

Åsa Larsson Blind\'s statement in the questions and answers part shows
the potential long term implications of the SCoPEx project\'s planned
test flight in Giron/Kiruna on indigenous peoples\' standing in relation
to geoengineering research. When Blind was asked about next steps in
relation to the SCoPEx project, she stated that the Sámi Council had
written an open letter to Harvard University for which they were
collecting co-signatures from indigenous peoples\' organizations from
around the world before sending it:

Through the letter "we hope that we can show that we have a joint
position and that we actually can influence the discussion. And to focus
on what we should discuss. And I would like to also touch upon what Tom
\[Goldtooth\] said, because I believe that it is very important. [I\'m
convinced that [indigenous peoples\' knowledge has the potential to play
a significant role and a way toward a sustainable future for
all]{.mark}.... So, this step that we are taking, is also to that we, as
indigenous peoples, [we want to contribute to the solutions]{.mark}.
[And we do not see]{.mark} solar [geoengineering as part of
that]{.mark}. So, we hope that our letter can help us get into the
discussion."]{.underline}

[We can see from the below statement from Blind that the [SCoPEx
project]{.mark} team, through its conduct in failing to consult the Sámi
people on their planned test flight in the Sámi domicile area [provided
an effective antagonistic reference point in relation to which a global
indigenous coalition opposed to geoengineering could be
mobilized]{.mark}:]{.underline}

["We have taken this initiative, but it is on behalf of indigenous
voices everywhere. We see the response that we get to this letter, that
[we have major indigenous organizations from all over the world]{.mark}.
This is a joint position. So even if this is our initiative, I see this
as a joint cause, and supporting the letter for indigenous voices
everywhere, because we have broad support for [the letter]{.mark}... [is
not a Sámi position, it is not an Arctic position, it\'s a joint
indigenous position from all over the world]{.mark}. And we can also
show with the position and the broad support that I am sure that we are
going to get... it will also show that [indigenous peoples are not alone
in this, this is a global position]{.mark}, this is a joint position,
and I hope that will also make a difference."]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} open [letter]{.mark} addressed at Harvard University,
dated 04.06.2021, [was co-signed by more than 30 indigenous peoples\'
organizations from around the world]{.mark}]{.underline} (Doyle, 2021;
Sámi Council Open Letter to Harvard University, 2021). This suggests
that the Sámi Council\'s global leadership among indigenous peoples has
potential for significant impact in shaping their attitudes toward
geoengineering research and in expanding the indigenous contingent of
the anti-geoengineering coalition of indigenous peoples\' organizations
and environmental civil society groups. The tone adopted in the letter
was a bit different from that of the Sámi Council\'s previous letter to
the SCC, as it did not focus on any of the specifics of SCoPEx planned
activities in Giron/Kiruna, but rather, centered on the value-driven,
core discursive nodal point of antagonism between living in harmony with
Mother Nature, and the mastery over nature mentality expressed though
the concept of geoengineering:

"We note with greatest concern that efforts toward the potential
development of solar geoengineering technology are now taken and planned
to be performed through field tests. [[SAI]{.mark} (stratospheric
aerosol injection) technology builds upon artificially manipulating the
environment and thereafter, if deployed, might [generate irreversible
changes to natural systems.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Climate manipulation
strongly contradicts our understanding and experience of how to respect
and live in harmony with Mother Nature, and therefore, this technology
is not something we see as a part of our chosen
future]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[From the above, we can see how [the SCoPEx project provided a reference
point for the deepening of a pre-existing alliance of green civil
society organizations and indigenous peoples organizations centered on
the HOME campaign]{.mark}, with the first step consisting of the Sámi
Council opting to join it, followed by its effort to mobilize indigenous
peoples from around the world, with some apparent success. As shown
above, the key discursive nodal points that constitute the alliance of
indigenous peoples\' organizations and environmental civil society
organizations, and high profile environmental scholars and activists, is
[their shared articulation of themselves as respecting the sanctity of
Mother Earth, advocating for drastic emission cuts and nature-based
solutions to climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Geoengineering
is]{.mark} posited as [embodying the opposite of these values, as it
is]{.mark} seen as [expressive of colonial, extractivist mastery over
nature mentalities,]{.mark} [and as a legitimation device for the status
quo, providing the billionaires who fund it with the promise of a
solution that avoids taking any drastic measures on emission
cuts]{.mark}. The framing is one of [antagonistic opposition between
those fighting for the sanctity of Mother Earth and the predatory elites
who try to solve the problems they have created by over-exploiting
nature, through further, deliberate manipulation of it, where they stand
to benefit as the providers of the solutions to the problems they
created]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What are some examples of the kinds of projects that are being proposed?

A well-known idea is to [[inject aerosols into]{.mark} the upper
[atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline} to cause it to reflect sunlight rather
than allowing the sun's energy to hit the Earth's surface. It's very
controversial. It stems from the idea that if you have a volcanic
eruption, huge amounts of volcanic material can be pushed into the
atmosphere, and that can have a temporary but noticeable cooling effect.
So the idea is: What if we just did that ourselves, and did it to
permanently cool the planet? You might be able to do that. But the
[logistics behind it are [challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it
[[doesn't resolve other aspects of global warming,]{.underline}]{.mark}
such as ocean acidification. In fact, it will contribute to further
ocean acidification. As an intervention, it would be colossally
irresponsible because we don't know what the consequences might be.

[[For]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} in particular, [there are
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [[trying to]{.mark} increase or
[enhance the albedo]{.mark}]{.underline}---or reflectivity---[of the sea
ice that exists, because that does the world a great favour by bouncing
solar energy back out into space rather than absorbing it.]{.underline}
Arctic sea ice is retreating really quickly, and the idea is that by
increasing the albedo, we can either preserve more sea ice or put
measures in place to grow sea ice artificially. There's no reason to
assume that you couldn't artificially grow sea ice at a really small
scale. There are some experiments that have tried to do that, and they
kind of worked. [[But the colossal scale of the Arctic Sea ice that you
would have to adjust makes the whole thing practically
impossible]{.underline}.]{.mark}

What risks do these [[geoengineering]{.mark} projects]{.underline} pose
for the Arctic?

Well, it depends on what you want to do. Many of them [[introduce risks
to the environment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Sometimes they're called
"unintended consequences," but that's a misnomer because we kind of know
what the consequences might be. Still, some people seem happy to go
along with them.

[[Suppose]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[thickening sea ice can
work]{.mark}]{.underline} and that we could bring thousands of devices
into the Arctic to do it. [[That would require a level of presence in
the Arctic]{.mark} that is [far in excess of what we have at the moment.
Consultation with Indigenous Peoples would need to
happen]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And who would make the decision to
do it? It is very difficult to see how we would ever have any governance
to support it on an international level.

[[In]{.mark} the [example of]{.mark} intentionally [putting a pollutant
into the Arctic system, the other risk is to the marine biology]{.mark}.
These are fragile ecosystems,]{.underline} and [[introducing anything
that might]{.underline} [interfere]{.underline}]{.mark} with them
[[could be felt permanently]{.mark},]{.underline} or at least for a very
long time.

Overall, [introducing people, industry and intentional pollutants into
the Arctic would make it a very different place from what it is right
now]{.underline}.

If these ideas pose such risks, [[why do you think they are being
considered]{.underline}]{.mark}?

When I started to see these ideas being presented at climate COPs and
other climate meetings without challenge, I realized that the people who
were accepting the ideas as feasible were doing so because that's how
they're presented. But I and others know that these are actually
unworkable.

There are also vested interests when it comes to geoengineering.
[[Suppose you're an oil]{.underline}]{.mark} and gas [[company]{.mark}
that is [making]{.mark}]{.underline} huge amounts of [[money as
people]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to [[burn fossil fuels. It would be
very tempting to support a geoengineering idea
that]{.underline}]{.mark}, frankly, [[will never
happen]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is just the pretence that they are
contributing to a solution by spending a little money on research, when
they know full well it will never actually happen. That is something I
think we all need to keep our eyes open for.

[New study indicates]{.underline} that [[reflecting solar energy back to
space]{.underline}]{.mark} in an attempt to reduce global warming [could
[cause more problems than it solves]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, resulting
in an accelerating rise in atmospheric temperature, are creating a
hugely [significant challenge to people and the planet]{.underline}.  

Scientists are looking into the plausibility of ideas that aim to limit
the effects of climate change, while carbon emissions from
humans burning fossil fuels continue to over-insulate the planet.
\'Solar geoengineering\' proposes to reflect incoming sunlight back into
space by deliberately releasing reflective particles into the upper
atmosphere where they block the sun\'s warming rays.

Providing deeper insight 

New research funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and led by
Dr Abdul Malik, formerly a researcher at the Grantham Institute --
Climate Change and the Environment, with colleagues at Imperial College
London and Zhejiang University in China, offers the most detailed
analysis yet and contributes to the ongoing Geoengineering Model
Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP), which investigates the likely effects
of geoengineering on the planet.

Dr Abdul Malik, lead author and former Postdoctoral Research Fellow at
the Grantham Institute, now a researcher at King Abdullah University of
Science and Technology.

The authors of the study, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and
Physics, [[simulated three versions of the Earth's
climate using high-powered computers]{.mark} running the UK Met Office's
climate model,]{.underline} called HadCM3L. These three experimental
Earths explored the consequences of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide
concentrations with and without solar geoengineering, to see what would
happen over a thousand years. These experiments are [[much longer than
previous]{.mark} such [studies]{.mark} and [provide deeper insight
into the potential implications of
solar geoengineering]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[first]{.mark} experiment [simulated]{.mark}]{.underline} the
climate before the time of the Industrial Revolution
(approximately 1750-1850), before humans were burning large amounts of
fossil fuels and increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere, this is
known as [the '[pre-Industrial' period]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The
[[second envisaged]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark} loaded [[with]{.mark} four times
more carbon dioxide than]{.underline} in the
[pre-Industrial]{.underline} period: This simulated
[a scenario where [no actions]{.mark} were [taken to cut today's carbon
emission]{.mark}s]{.underline}. The [[third]{.underline}]{.mark}
experiment [[simulated]{.mark} a world with four times the
pre-Industrial level of carbon dioxide as before, but with sunlight
reduced by 4% at the top of the Earth\'s atmosphere, which simulated
a [climate]{.mark} that had been [altered by solar
geoengineering.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

What does solar geoengineering mean for the climate? 

The [study found that [solar geoengineering could counterbalance the
warming in global mean]{.mark}]{.underline} (average) [[surface
temperature]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting from quadrupled carbon
dioxide. [[However]{.mark}, the [scientists also saw]{.mark}
a [significant increase in the number and intensity
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a naturally occurring climate phenomenon called
the [[El Niño]{.underline}]{.mark} Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

ENSO is an irregular cycle between two opposite phases known as 'El
Niño', a warming of the ocean surface in the equatorial Pacific, and 'La
Niña', a cooling of the ocean surface in the equatorial Pacific, both of
which result in changes to atmospheric circulation. ENSO is the subject
of intense focus for climate experts, owing to its ability to affect
global climate systems and consequences of this for fisheries,
agriculture, weather, and natural disasters worldwide.  

Dr Abdul Malik, now a postdoctoral researcher at King Abdullah
University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia,
said: \"[[More intense La Niña events and frequent occurrence of extreme
ENSO events can strongly impact temperature, precipitation]{.mark},
floods and [drought]{.mark} patterns [across the
globe]{.mark}]{.underline}\". 

Emeritus Professor Joanna Haigh, Distinguished Research Fellow at
Imperial and former Co-Director of the Grantham Institute, said: \"The
[[results]{.mark} of this study [indicate]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
solar [geoengineering can in no sense be viewed as a sensible rescue
plan]{.mark} due to the potential to severely impact on temperature,
precipitation, floods and drought patterns across the
globe]{.underline}.\"

The [study showed]{.underline} that [[El Niño]{.underline}]{.mark} event
t[hat occurred approximately every 3.3 years in]{.underline} the climate
of the [pre-Industrial]{.underline} period [[could occur more
frequently]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [solar geoengineered
climate - approximately every 2.9 years]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[extreme]{.underline}]{.mark} El Niño or La Niña
[[events]{.underline}]{.mark}, which might occur every 16-22 years in a
pre-Industrial climate [[could occur every 10-16
years]{.mark} in the geoengineered climate.]{.underline} Furthermore,
the most extreme La Niña events could become more intense in the
geoengineered climate than in the preindustrial climate, and that these
could more significantly impact the global climate system. 

\"This study is based on a single climate model with much longer climate
experiments than previous studies, which found no change in the ENSO
frequency in the geoengineered climate. However, more experiments, as
proposed by the GeoMIP project, need to be performed to understand
further the ENSO variability and its impacts in a geoengineered
climate,\" concluded co-author Professor Long Cao from Zhejiang
University, China.

Current State of SRM Research

Extensive research efforts are underway in the scientific community to
gain a comprehensive understanding of the feasibility, risks, benefits,
and negative consequences of possible SRM strategies to reduce surface
temperatures. SRM research centers on developing and studying a range of
potential future scenarios that combine emissions reductions, CDR, and
SRM to varying degrees and over varying timescales. In one such
scenario, commonly called "peak-shaving" (illustrated in Figure 2), SRM
would be implemented as a temporary method alongside strong GHG emission
cuts and aggressive CDR to stabilize global temperatures and offset some
of the most negative impacts of climate change.

Figure 2.  Schematic diagram representing the concept of peak-shaving.
Different lines illustrate the global mean temperatures for future
scenarios. Blue arrows represent the relative magnitude of the
temperature impact of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI).

[[SRM deployments large enough to temporarily offset
climate]{.mark}]{.underline} change [[impacts could have substantial
risks]{.mark} and]{.underline} unintended and [unexpected consequences.
[Side effects]{.mark} of SRM are [driven by complex]{.mark} chemical,
radiative, and [dynamical interactions,]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
changes to the hydrologic cycle and clouds, or effects on ecosystems,
agricultural production, and the carbon cycle. Additional impacts on the
protective stratospheric ozone layer by SAI and alterations to the El
Niño Southern Oscillation by MCB are also possible. The potential risks
and benefits to human health and well-being and to ecosystems from SRM
need to be evaluated and assessed relative to those associated with
plausible trajectories of ongoing climate change without SRM (i.e.,
using risk vs. risk analysis). Current understanding of risks and
benefits is limited by uncertainties in the observations and modeling
tools used to examine SRM impacts. 

[[GHG]{.mark}-induced [warming and SRM]{.mark}-induced [cooling are
different physical mechanisms]{.mark}; therefore, [SRM would not]{.mark}
simply [undo GHG]{.mark}-induced [warming and cannot reverse all climate
changes everywhere]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, [[effects of climate
change on regional weather]{.underline}]{.mark} patterns [w[ill not be
fully mitigated]{.mark} by SRM]{.underline}. Some regions could
experience cooler or wetter conditions, and others warmer or drier
conditions, compared to a climate without SRM. [In addition[, ocean
acidification will persist]{.mark} unabated [if GHG emissions
continue]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

Importantly, both the [[effectiveness of SRM]{.underline}]{.mark} in
offsetting the impacts of global warming and the potential unintended
consequences [[depend on how and when SRM is
deployed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent studies on SRM indicate that some
of the negative impacts can be reduced through design of an optimal
injection strategy (i.e. location, magnitude, and timing of injection). 

Substantial modeling efforts to understand the processes and impacts of
both SAI and MCB are ongoing. These efforts have demonstrated the basic
efficacy of SRM for cooling Earth's surface temperatures, while also
identifying a number of gaps and uncertainties in our current
understanding, as well as potential unintended outcomes.

[[Many]{.mark} of the [processes most important for
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} SRM approaches---such as those that
control the formation of clouds and aerosols---[[are]{.mark} among the
[most uncertain components of the climate system. Climate models differ
in simulating]{.mark}]{.underline} large-scale aerosol climate
[effects,]{.underline} including on surface temperatures, [[due to
variations in how]{.mark} aerosol [processes]{.mark}, atmospheric
transport and mixing, and physics [are represented]{.mark}.]{.underline}
There remain large uncertainties as to the changes in large scale
circulation, regional climate, air quality, and weather, associated with
SRM. Research on low-level clouds has also revealed complex interactions
with aerosols, so the [[net climate effect of injecting aerosols into
the lower atmosphere for MCB is difficult to
project.]{.mark}]{.underline} Improving understanding of these
fundamental processes requires expanded atmospheric observations and
innovations in modeling.

Behind the shiny facade of these **[[highly
speculative]{.underline}]{.mark}** "techno-fixes," geoengineering is
fraught with risks, uncertainties, [and]{.mark} dangers that [[threaten
to **delay real climate action** and cause **more harm than
good**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

What Is Geoengineering?

Geoengineering refers to large or planetary-scale interventions in the
Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land to counteract some of the effects
of climate change. These methods range from reflecting sunlight to
removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Crucially, **[[none tackle]{.mark} the [root causes of]{.mark} the
[climate crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the primary driver of which is
the production and burning of fossil fuels.

Geoengineering Categories

Solar Radiation Modification Or Manipulation (SRM)

SRM techniques attempt to reflect sunlight back into space to cool
Earth. Methods include releasing large amounts of tiny reflective
particles (e.g., sulfur dioxide) into the stratosphere, deploying
mirrors in space, or modifying clouds, ice, and plants to make them more
reflective.

Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)

CDR techniques theorize removing carbon from the atmosphere on a massive
scale. Methods range from sucking carbon straight out of the air to the
large-scale burning of trees for energy, capturing and storing the
emissions, and even dumping minerals in the ocean or developing
monoculture seaweed mega-farms to increase carbon uptake.

Other approaches

Other theories include slowing ice melt by pumping seawater onto polar
and glacial ice to thicken it, spreading billions of tiny reflective
beads on the surface of the Arctic or glacial ice to increase its
reflectivity, and building a giant curtain in the ocean to block warmer
waters.

Why is Geoengineering a Bad Idea?

It won't fix the climate crisis

Geoengineering [technologies]{.mark} [do nothing to address the drivers
of the climate crisis, and [all]{.mark} [come with major risks and
unknowns]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [solar]{.mark}
geoengineering is [**[inherently unpredictable]{.mark}** and [risks
further destabilizing]{.mark} an already destabilized climate
system]{.underline}. [[Models]{.mark} [show]{.mark} that [it would have
an uneven effect regionally]{.mark} [and]{.mark} could **[exacerbate
climate change]{.mark}** in countries on the front line of the
crisis.]{.underline} What's more, it [[carries]{.mark} the [risk of
'termination shock']{.mark} where **[temperatures suddenly
spiral]{.mark}**]{.underline} if, for whatever reason, deployment is
paused or stopped. Meanwhile, [[no marine]{.mark} carbon dioxide
[removal techniques]{.mark} have been [proven effective in]{.mark} the
[long-term removal and storage of CO2]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} some
[could]{.mark} [undermine]{.mark} the [ocean's ability to sequester
carbon]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It's a **[[dangerous distraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** that undermines
real climate solutions

The illusion that geoengineering can help "fix" climate change is a
dangerous distraction from the real solutions to the crisis and
**[[risks prolonging fossil fuel dependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
fact, geoengineering technologies are inherently unpredictable and pose
new, significant, unprecedented risks to the fragile ecosystems that
sustain life on Earth, which are our best allies in the fight against
the crisis. What's more, [[relying]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [promise of
future speculative]{.mark} [technologies instead of implementing real
solutions today]{.mark} will **[lead to]{.mark} an [overshoot of]{.mark}
the [critical climate threshold of 1.5ºC]{.mark} and [lock in
catastrophic climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By undermining
transformative, justice-centered solutions to the climate crisis,
geoengineering approaches also risk entrenching inequitable political
and social power and perpetuating neocolonialism.

It requires an unprecedented scale for any meaningful climate impact

[To have any chance of]{.mark} their [intended impact]{.mark} on the
climate geoengineering technologies would [[have to be deployed
at]{.mark} a [truly unprecedented scale]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with
**[[enormous political, social, and environmental

In the absence of any field assessments and pilot studies, and [based on
a variety of modelling investigations, the]{.underline}
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline}, 2023)
[has noted large uncertainties in the effectiveness of deployment of
solar geoengineering]{.underline} (De Coninck et al., 2018), substantial
[knowledge gaps regarding its cost]{.underline}-effectiveness, [and a
range of risks]{.underline} around deployment.

[It has been suggested that aerosols could be injected into the
stratosphere using balloons, airships, and/or artillery. However, the
most efficient method is]{.underline} likely to involve [a fleet
of]{.underline} custom-built and/or [specially modified
aircraft]{.underline} (Moriyama et al., 2017). Smith and Wagner (2018)
estimate that [60,000 flights annually---0.15% of all current flights
globally]{.underline} (OAG 2024)---[could be required for a lasting
effect]{.underline}. Smith et al. (2024) recently highlighted the Boeing
777F as a potential candidate, albeit requiring substantial
modifications, with a fleet of 90 planes focusing on deployment in the
polar regions. Deployment strategies include aerosol injection: (i) in
the tropics or subtropics (at or equatorward of 30°), (ii) uniformly
across all latitudes, and (iii) in the sub-polar or polar regions (at or
poleward of 60°). Typically, the tropopause is lowest in altitude in the
polar regions, facilitating larger payloads and requiring fewer planes
to achieve a given injection mass (Lee et al., 2021; Moriyama et al.,
2017; Smith, 2020).

[[SAIs would need a highly specific deployment to have significant
impact in polar regions]{.underline}]{.mark} (Goddard et al., 2023; Lee
et al., 2023). The [[radiative forcing]{.underline}]{.mark} from
stratospheric aerosols [[depends on local]{.mark} incoming [solar
radiation and top-of-atmosphere albedo. Polar regions are less
responsive to aerosol injection during sunlit
periods]{.mark}]{.underline} because of their lower insolation and
higher albedo produced by ice and snow (Govindasamy & Caldeira, 2000;
Tilmes et al.,228 2018). Furthermore, [[injections]{.mark} are totally
i[neffective during the winter months in the polar regions. The
Brewer-Dobson circulation]{.mark}]{.underline}, characterized by rising
air in the tropics and descending air in the mid and high latitudes,
[[affects the distribution and lifetime]{.mark} of stratospheric
aerosols.]{.underline} [[Aerosols injected at high
latitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[have a shorter lifetime and
more localized cooling effects owing to their rapid removal by the
poleward movement and descent of air]{.underline}]{.mark} (Robock et
al., 2008; Kravitz et al., 2017) questioning the effectiveness of SAI in
the Arctic.

[[If deployed at the necessary scale, SAI would only have discernible
effects]{.mark}]{.underline} (within climate variability) [[over 20
years]{.underline}]{.mark} (Duffey et al., 2023)---[the [same
time]{.mark}]{.underline} horizon over [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[effects of sharp mitigation by reduced GHG emissions would be
seen]{.underline}]{.mark} (Tilmes et al., 2020).

['[Termination shock']{.mark}]{.underline} is the rapid and severe
warming that could occur by the unmasking of ongoing GHG emissions if
any future large-scale deployment of solar geoengineering were halted
(Parker and Irvine, 2018). The [sudden cessation would
remove]{.underline} the [reflective aerosols]{.underline} from the
stratosphere, [causing the Earth's climate to adjust abruptly to the
conditions dictated by GHG concentrations and [bring]{.mark}ing
a]{.underline} swift, significant [[rise in global
temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark}. Climate models suggest that following
SAI termination, surface temperatures would increase within a decade or
two to values consistent with GHG forcing. Major water cycle changes
would245 occur, including a rapid increase in global mean precipitation
(Douville et al., 2021). Parker and Irvine (2018) claim that timely
policies could avert termination shock. However, [[relying on SAI
without GHG removal would likely require prolonged]{.underline}]{.mark}
(even permanent) [[injection at continued financial, ecological and
human costs.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [readiness of SAI for implementation varies greatly between
polar-specific and global deployments]{.underline} (Diamond et al.,
2023). [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} a launch [[decision were made by 2030,
polar SAI could]{.mark}]{.underline} theoretically [[be operational by
2040]{.underline}]{.mark}. On a global scale, if a decision to proceed
were made by 2050, it could take until 2060 for SAI to be fully
operational (Smith et al., 2024). However, [[many obstacles stand in the
way of what is theoretically possible, including finance, governance,
and]{.mark} the determination of -- and [responsibility for -- negative
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, there is no
international governance framework to oversee such work. Overcoming this
and other issues will take far longer than the implementation of
available actions to strengthen greenhouse gas emission reductions and
engage transformative adaptation.

Negative consequences

[In]{.underline} the [polar regions, atmospheric injections would be
ineffective in winter owing to the lack of sunlight, and instead could
lead to residual warming in winter]{.underline} ([due to the blanketing
effect of cloud cover]{.underline}), potentially [altering]{.underline}
the high-latitude [seasonal cycle]{.underline} (Jiang et al., 2019;
Banerjee et al., 2021), with potential consequences for the water cycle
through atmospheric drying. It could also cause stratospheric heating,
which may alter atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to wintertime
warming over northern Eurasia and potentially other unintended
consequences (Banerjee et al., 2021; Jones et al., 2021).

[[SAIs would not address non-temperature related effects of GHG
emissions, such as ocean acidification]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rather
[[they could exacerbate acidification, especially if
sulfates]{.underline}]{.mark} (the original "acid rain" emissions source
from coal-fired power) [[were used]{.underline}]{.mark}, with consequent
negative impacts on ecosystems and economies. Both the Arctic and
Southern Oceans already show seasonally corrosive conditions for shelled
life due to today's atmospheric CO2 levels, and shell damage from
increasing acidification was observed from samples taken as early as the
2000s (Bednarsek et al, 2020). Year-round corrosive conditions are
projected to spread throughout much of the polar marine ecosystem with
even moderate emissions pathways, at CO2 levels above 450 ppm (IPCC,
2019). Ocean acidification is also a very long-term problem, with a
return to today's pH levels taking 30,000--50,000 years (Honisch et al,
2012). Indeed, acidification rates are higher today than at any point in
the last 300 million years (Pelejero et al, 2010). This raises the
specter of extinctions for many polar marine shelled animals and the
economically important species that depend on them, such as krill and
cod (AMAP, 2018; Green et al, 2021).

Injections using sulfate aerosols can also lead to chemical reactions in
the stratosphere that deplete ozone (Tilmes et al., 2008). Ozone
depletion increases the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the
Earth's surface, causing harmful effects on human health (see below),
ecosystems, and biodiversity as a whole (Moch et al., 2023; Zarnetske et
al., 2021).

[[Using SAI to]{.mark} differentially [cool one polar region]{.mark}
alone [could disrupt global climate patterns.]{.mark} An [imbalance in
cooling between]{.mark} the [hemispheres could shift the Intertropical
Convergence Zone]{.mark},]{.underline} potentially interfering with
seasons (Haywood et al., 2013; Kravitz et al., 2017; Määttänen et al.,
2024) and reducing rainfall in some regions -- [thereby [affecting water
availability and agriculture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tilmes et al., 2022).

The [[reduction in sunlight]{.mark} reaching the Earth's surface could
reduce photosynthesis and agricultural productivity, as occurred in 1815
when]{.underline} the eruption of Indonesia's [Mount Tambora eruption
released sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere]{.underline} (Oppenheimer,
2003). Reduced sunlight could negatively affect crop yields, threatening
food security and potentially leading to higher food prices. This
[[would disproportionately affect poorer regions that rely heavily on
agriculture]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wang et al., 2023). Uneven effects of
SAI might potentially harm those already most vulnerable to disturbances
in food production, and with less means to protect themselves if
benefits to more powerful populations are optimized (Honegger et al.,
2021). The effects of SAI on ocean circulation are also uncertain.
Crucially, some models suggest the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) could be weakened, with implications for regional
climates and weather patterns (Tilmes et al., 2020).

[Concerns]{.underline} also [exist regarding the effect of aerosol
inhalation on human health]{.underline} (Carslon et al., 2022). Sulfuric
acid aerosols can irritate the respiratory system, causing coughing,
airway irritation and inflammation and, in severe cases, respiratory
distress. [Chronic exposure has been associated with an increased risk
of laryngeal cancer]{.underline} owing to long-term irritation and
inflammation. This could lead to increased healthcare costs and add a
burden on medical infrastructure, with particular risks for vulnerable
populations (Effiong and Neitzel, 2016a,b).

Discussion

Our results show that [[solar geoengineering may not be a
fail-safe]{.underline}]{.mark} option [[to counter]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least [in]{.underline} extreme and
[idealized]{.underline} solar geoengineering [scenarios, rising GHG
concentrations can eventually lead to breakup of subtropical
stratocumulus decks]{.underline}. Because our model assumes that the
extra solar energy absorbed when subtropical stratocumulus decks break
up is spread uniformly across the globe, the tropical SST increase of
around 5 K can be taken as a proxy for the global warming triggered by
stratocumulus breakup. That is, [[even with solar geoengineering,
strong]{.mark} global [warming can occur if CO~2~ continues to
accumulate in the atmosphere]{.mark} to reach concentrations more than
four times today's. It would take over a century to reach such CO~2~
concentrations,]{.underline} even if emissions increase further
([[42]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r42)).
Extending solar geoengineering to such high CO~2~ concentrations is not
currently considered. And it is possible that the stratocumulus breakup
and attendant warming can be delayed to yet higher CO~2~ concentrations
if solar radiation is managed even more aggressively, so that there is
no surface temperature increase initially. [[If stratocumulus breakup
eventually occurs, the warming it triggers dramatically amplifies the
termination shock that would occur if solar geoengineering were stopped
thereafter]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Several caveats are in order. The [[thinning of stratocumulus clouds
under increasing CO~2~ concentrations is robust and well
established]{.mark}]{.underline}
([[24]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r24)).
The amplifying feedback between thinning clouds and a warming sea
surface is likewise rooted in well-understood physics, and that it can
run away and lead to stratocumulus breakup is physically plausible. The
mechanisms involved are known to play a role in the
stratocumulus--cumulus transition in the present climate
([[21]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r21)).
However, [[it remains unclear at which]{.mark} CO~2~ [concentrations
breakup]{.mark} of stratocumulus [may occur.]{.mark}]{.underline} Our
simulations with different subsidence rates illustrate some of the
difficulties of quantifying the critical CO~2~ concentrations for
stratocumulus breakup. But because our modeling setup lacks explicit
representation of spatial heterogeneity and of temporal variations, such
as the seasonal cycle and large-scale weather variability
(meteorological noise), the real uncertainties are even greater. Spatial
heterogeneity means that stratocumulus breakup, if it occurs in reality,
would occur first in regions and seasons in which the stratocumulus
decks are close to the stability threshold, likely at the margins of
current stratocumulus regions
([[27]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r27)).
The lack of spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in our
simulations make it difficult to quantify more precisely the range of
CO~2~ concentrations over which stratocumulus breakup may occur, or when
the clouds reform after CO~2~ concentrations are lowered. The sources of
noise neglected in our simulation may also reduce the width of the
hysteresis loop and render the transitions between the states with and
without stratocumulus decks less sharp as a function of CO~2~
concentration than they are in our simulations
([[27]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r27)).
These are some of the limitations that come with the idealizations that
were necessary to clearly illustrate the mechanisms involved and make
this study computationally feasible; we plan to overcome these
limitations in future work. Furthermore, we have not addressed the
question of which, if any, solar geoengineering method may provide
sufficient reductions in absorbed solar radiation to offset the
radiative forcing of quadrupled (or higher) CO~2~ concentrations; it is
unclear whether such extensive solar geoengineering would be feasible
([[12]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r12),
[[14]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r14)).

[[Caveats and limitations notwithstanding, the results illustrate a
hitherto-unrecognized risk of solar geoengineering]{.mark}. It [stems
from]{.mark} the [effects of elevated CO~2~ concentrations on cloud
cover]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} generally reduce or [thin cloud cover and
are amplified by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[surface warming that
results]{.mark} from reduced]{.underline} or thinned [cloud
cover]{.underline}
([[16]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r16)--[[20]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r20)).
[[These effects are **difficult to offset by manipulating** the amount
of **solar radiation** Earth absorbs.]{.mark} The idealizations of our
study bring limitations with them, especially with regard to
quantitative statements about the CO~2~ concentrations]{.underline} at
which stratocumulus breakup occurs. [Nonetheless]{.underline}, [the
results highlight]{.underline} that the relative [risks and benefits of
solar geoengineering remain insufficiently understood and quantified. It
is imperative to understand]{.underline} and quantify
[these]{.underline} risks and benefits [better]{.underline}. Doing so
will require developing climate models that capture clouds, and
especially low clouds, more accurately than do current models
([[43]{.underline}](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2003730117#core-collateral-r43)).

Effectiveness and feasibility

The [[main issue]{.mark}]{.underline} for this idea [[is]{.mark} not
whether the technique itself can work]{.underline} (although there are

cover today's winter sea ice. [If]{.mark}]{.underline} we accept Desch

(considering the strong sea ice drift), the [[need for year-round

### Solar Geoengineering Fails

#### Termination worse than status quo

Sudden termination of geoengineering causes [[extremely rapid
temperature velocities]{.mark}
(Fig. [2b](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2)) with
the predicted median velocity [on land]{.mark} (10.4 km yr^−1^) **[more
than four times greater]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} the median
[ocean]{.mark} velocity (12.8 km yr^--1^) **[more than six times
greater]{.mark}** than recent climate change
(]{.underline}Fig. [[2c]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2) and
Supplementary
Table [[1]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1)).
[[Temperature velocities at termination]{.mark} also [far exceed those
predicted for future climate change without
geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Fig. [[2d]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2)).
Compared to RCP4.5, the predicted median increase in the migration speed
required for species to track moving temperatures is 8.0 km yr^−1^ in
the ocean and 6.4 km yr^−1^ on land, which represent 2.7- and 2.8-fold
increases, respectively. The most rapid velocities occur where
temperature changes are high and spatial gradients in temperature are
low. Temperature velocities at termination [are **[most extreme in
tropical oceans]{.mark}, the [biodiversity-rich]{.mark}** Amazon Basin,
Africa, Eurasia [and polar regions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At the global scale, the differences between geoengineering and RCP4.5
are less for precipitation than for temperature
(Fig. [[1]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig1)).
This is partly because, compared to temperature, precipitation
velocities show much stronger differences among regions in their
response (positive or negative) to each phase of geoengineering
(Fig. [[2e,f]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2) and
Supplementary
Fig. [[1]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1)).
Given these strong regional differences, the predicted median velocity
of precipitation on land for implementation is --0.5 km yr^--1^,
indicative of the relatively weak global drying trend. [Precipitation
velocities for termination show]{.mark} a [reversed pattern]{.mark} to
implementation, and are only weakly correlated with temperature
velocities for termination (*r* = 0.09). Sudden implementation reduces
precipitation with high negative velocities in the Amazon, northern
Europe and Asia, Australia and southeast Africa
(Fig. [[2h]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2)).
This El Niño-like drying and warming would be likely to
[[increase]{.mark} the [incidence and intensity of]{.mark} pan-tropical
[forest fires]{.mark} (as in true El Niños), [increasing CO~2~ emissions
and decreasing air quality]{.mark}, with [negative impacts on public
health and
biodiversity]{.mark}[31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR31)]{.underline}^, ^[[32]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR32).

Temporal trends in temperature and precipitation over ten-year periods,
and [the [resulting]{.mark} [velocities]{.mark} of climate change, are
[more variable than for longer time periods]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
is because ten-year trends are more strongly influenced by sub-decadal
temperature fluctuations and the phase of phenomena such as the El
Niño/Southern Oscillation. Therefore, we tested whether [climate
velocities]{.mark} for the ten-year periods [[following
implementation]{.mark} (2020--2029) and termination (2070--2079) [of
geoengineering]{.mark} are [predicted to exceed climate
velocities]{.mark} for all ten-year intervals [in]{.mark} both the
[historical record]{.mark}]{.underline} and in RCP4.5 climate forecasts.
The median for global ocean temperature velocity for both implementation
and termination is predicted to exceed the most extreme temperature
velocities for all ten-year intervals in the recent historical record
(Fig. [[3a]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig3)).
Furthermore, the probability of predicted ten-year ocean temperature
velocities for RCP4.5 being below the median for termination is high
(0.95). Similarly, for temperature velocities on land, median velocity
projections for both implementation and termination are more extreme
than in the historical record
(Fig. [[3b]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig3)).
The probability of predicted RCP4.5 velocities being less than the
median for termination is 0.90. In all cases for temperature, the
extremes of global temperature velocity projections for implementation
and termination are at least 10 km yr^--1^ greater than RCP4.5 on the
same ten-year timescales. In contrast, differences between global
estimates of precipitation velocity for geoengineering and for ten-year
windows for either historical data or RCP4.5 forecasts are much less
pronounced
(Fig. [[3c]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig3)),
which is indicative of greater variability in the precipitation response
to geoengineering
(Figs. [[1]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig1) and [[2]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2)).

[[Across terrestrial and marine biodiversity hotspots]{.mark}, sudden
**[termination]{.mark} [results in extreme temperature
velocities]{.mark} that are 2--[4 times faster than]{.mark} those for
either [historical data or future climate change without
geoengineering]{.mark}**, and are [highest in tropical marine
environments]{.mark}]{.underline} (medians \>38 km yr^−1^;
Fig. [[5c,d]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig5) and
Supplementary
Table [[1]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1)).
High temperature velocities in tropical regions may result from smaller
temperature increases at termination than for high latitudes, being
divided by shallower spatial gradients in temperature
(Fig. [[2]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig2) and
Supplementary
Figs. [[2]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1),[[6]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1)).
Thus, the effect of high temperature velocities on biodiversity could be
partly mitigated if many species are far from their upper thermal
limits. However[, [tropical species]{.mark} generally [have narrower
thermal tolerances than]{.mark} their [temperate
counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline} and are often near or above optimal
temperatures, making [climate]{.mark} tracking more [important
for]{.mark} their
[survival[[37]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR37)]{.mark}^--^[[39]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR39).
[[Extreme climate velocities from geoengineering]{.mark} termination
thus [represent]{.mark} a potentially [**acute threat to species
survival** in]{.mark} the [most biodiverse regions]{.mark} on
Earth]{.underline}.

Mean estimates of [species-range movements]{.mark} [in response to
recent warming]{.mark} for arthropods, birds, fish, reptiles and mammals
(1.7 km yr^−1^)[[18]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR18) are
4--[[**7 times slower** than predicted]{.mark} temperature [velocities
from]{.mark} sudden [termination]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, in a
broad sample of mammals, the [[median temperature velocity from
termination]{.mark} in mammal biodiversity hotspots (9.8 km yr^−1^) is
faster than the [median dispersal rate for **93% of species** and faster
than]{.mark} the [maximum]{.mark} dispersal [rate]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a
[**majority of
species**[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR19)]{.mark}]{.underline} (Supplementary
Fig. [[7]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#MOESM1)).
Given that mammals have relatively high dispersal ability, this result
suggests [that [less dispersive taxa]{.mark} may be **[even more at risk
of extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, the association of regions
of low endemism with high climate velocity since the Last Glacial
Maximum has been shown to be strongest for poorly dispersing amphibian
taxa, indicative of increased extinctions when poorly dispersing species
fail to track climate
change[[23]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#ref-CR23).
Thus, while differences in climate velocity between terrestrial hotspots
for some taxa are small, that amphibian biodiversity hotspots have the
highest temperature velocities from sudden termination suggests that
increased extinction risks would be especially severe for this group
(Fig. [[5c]{.underline}](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0431-0#Fig5)).
Further work is needed to link climate velocities with species-specific
dispersal rates and future dispersal cost pathways to obtain more
detailed estimates of possible [extinctions]{.mark}, in order to improve
forecasts of the [[consequences of geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}
for biodiversity.

Modelling a global shift

To understand how the rapid termination of solar generation could affect
wildlife, the [[researchers used models to compare changes in
temperature and rainfall]{.mark} [under]{.mark} a [scenario]{.mark} in
which [SRM runs from 2020 until 2070 to]{.mark} a [scenario]{.mark}
[with no geoengineering]{.mark} [and]{.mark} an [intermediate level
of]{.mark} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} (RCP4.5).

The researchers then calculated the "climate velocities" of each
scenario, which quantifies the speed and direction of shifting climates.

The results are shown on the charts below, which show the change in
temperature velocity for (a) a modelled scenario showing the
introduction of SRM, (b) the termination of SRM, (c) the current climate
between 1960 and 2014 and (d) an unengineered world with moderate
emissions.

In the chart, deep red signifies a rapid increase in the rate of
temperature rise, while blue shows rapidly decreasing temperature.

The [results show]{.mark} that [while]{.mark} the [implementation
of]{.mark} solar [geoengineering]{.mark} [could cause]{.mark}
[temperatures to fall]{.mark} [fairly quickly]{.mark}, [[sudden
termination]{.mark} could [cause rapid increases as temperatures
rebound]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[rate of change in temperature under]{.mark} the
[termination]{.mark} of SRM could be two to **[four times larger than
those caused by climate change itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
researchers conclude. The study [also]{.mark} finds [[similar]{.mark} --
though not as drastic -- [changes on rainfall]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This [large change]{.mark} in environmental conditions could **[[leave
many species unable to adapt and]{.mark} at a [high risk of
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the researchers say.

[Animals that do not find it easy to adapt to new environments, such as
[species found]{.mark} in [tropical rainforests and small island
habitats]{.mark}, will be the [least able to adapt]{.mark} to these
changes, they add. The [risk]{.mark} could be [highest for]{.mark}
slow-moving [amphibians]{.mark},]{.underline} the researchers note in
their paper:

"While differences in climate velocity between terrestrial hotspots for
some taxa \[animal groups\] are small, that amphibian biodiversity
hotspots have the highest temperature velocities from sudden termination
suggests that increased extinction risks would be especially severe for
this group."

In other words, a large number of amphibians are found in areas that are
expected to be most affected by a sudden SRM termination.

The new research makes an important contribution to the "broader
conversation" surrounding the risks of solar geoengineering, says Dr Ben
Kravitz, a climate scientist from the Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory, who was not involved in the new research. He tells Carbon
Brief:

"Although there are many issues that arise when one talks about
ecosystems, to the best of my knowledge, this study the first
quantitative look at what might happen to biodiversity under different
scenarios of geoengineering. And, importantly, the **[[study]{.mark} was
[done using multiple climate models]{.mark}]{.underline}**, meaning [we
have estimates of]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [robust]{.mark} the [model
responses]{.mark} [are]{.mark}."

Geoengineering could be implemented and terminated either gradually or
rapidly. Here we have chosen to investigate a scenario with both rapid
implementation and termination to explore the upper bound of the
exposure of biodiversity to climate change impacts at either end of a

a small number of nations could take action given the current lack of
regulatory constraints12,13. [**[Rapid termination]{.mark} is also
[feasible given]{.mark} the [weakness]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [global

conflict]{.mark} could cause geoengineering to fail, [and]{.mark}
[unintended negative consequences or regionally severe climate
events]{.mark} such as extreme droughts could [force rapid
termination]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if direct attribution of these
events to geoengineering could not be demonstrated3, 8, 13,14.
[Scholars]{.mark} of climate politics and policy have [noted]{.mark}
that the [**[challenge of sustaining]{.mark}** the
climate-change-offsetting effects of geoengineering and the risks of
termination [are]{.mark} a **[serious concern]{.mark}**]{.underline}
regarding the deployment of geoengineering8,12,13,14 (but see ref. 15).
Furthermore, the concomitant rapid climate changes16 (Fig. 1) represent
potentially the most significant and yet also unexplored consequences
for biodiversity and ecosystems from geoengineering5.

[As climate changes]{.mark}, the [appropriate conditions
necessary]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [persistence of a species
move]{.mark} across the Earth, driving species\' geographic range
movements in response to climate change17,18. Indeed, [**[species that
fail to track moving climates]{.mark} may [go extinct]{.mark}**,
[despite]{.mark} [suitable]{.mark} climate [conditions]{.mark} being
[present elsewhere]{.mark}19]{.underline},20. To this end, climate
velocities---the rate of climate change through time divided by the rate
across space21,22---quantify the speeds and directions of shifting
climates and have predicted range movements for a wide variety of marine
and terrestrial species17,18. Climate velocities thus provide a more
biologically relevant metric of exposure to climate change than
traditional macroclimatic anomalies, and can identify regions where
species are threatened by being unable to move fast enough to track
moving climates21, 23,24.

We used a 1° latitude--longitude grid to compare climate velocities for
the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) G4 scenario25
to representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5)26, an intermediate
emissions climate change scenario without geoengineering. We also
compared G4 geoengineering to historical climate data (1960--2014). In
G4, geoengineering begins in 2020 with an injection of 5 Tg
SO2---equivalent to a quarter of the 1991 Pinatubo Mountain volcanic
eruption---into the stratosphere at the Equator, which is then continued
annually until being terminated abruptly in 2070. This results in
approximately equal sulphur injections to the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres. We selected the G4 scenario because it posits that
geoengineering is used only to partially offset increases in radiative
forcing from RCP4.5, in which CO2 emissions peak around 2040, making it
both more credible and conservative than other GeoMIP scenarios25.

[[Global cooling from rapid geoengineering implementation]{.mark} (Fig.
1a,b) **[results in temperature velocity vectors with]{.mark} the
[opposite direction to warming]{.mark}**]{.underline} (that is, negative
velocities) that have especially high speeds [in polar regions]{.mark}
and the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark} Ocean (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the
[Amazon]{.mark} Basin, eastern [Pacific]{.mark}, [Alaska]{.mark} and the
Weddell Sea [have high positive temperature velocities from
warming]{.mark}, in agreement with known patterns of [[increased
probability of]{.mark} El Niño following **[large volcanic
eruptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}27,28. For the many species already
closely tracking positive climate velocities for recent warming17,18
(Fig. 2c), the rapid switch from positive to negative velocities with
geoengineering implementation would be expected to halt or even reverse
climate-driven range shifts. In contrast, where species-range shifts
have lagged past climate warming, the impact of large negative
temperature velocities associated with cooling would be reduced and
could be beneficial29. However, the [strong decadal-scale
climate]{.mark} variability from rapid implementation (Fig. 1) would
[[lead to repeated switching of]{.mark} the [climate signal]{.mark}
(warming--cooling--warming), and **[such variability]{.mark} is [known
from]{.mark} stochastic population [biology]{.mark} theory [to
negatively affect population persistence]{.mark}30**,
**[increasing]{.mark} the risk of local
[extinctions]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

the historical observations for 1960--2014 are shown (CRU TS3.23 for
land and HadISST 1.1 for oceans). The speed (km yr−1) of shifting
temperature and precipitation isoclines is the same for positive and
negative velocities of equal magnitude. The sign of the velocity
indicates a trend of local warming (+) or cooling (--) for temperature,
and wetting (+) or drying (--) for precipitation. A change of sign
between scenarios represents a 180° change in the direction of climate
movement (for example, from poleward to equatorward or, in mountain
regions, from upslope to downslope).

#### It's extremely risky

Daisy **Dunne,** 20**18** -- BSc in biology, BA in science journalism,
Associate Editor of CarbonBrief. "Geoengineering carries 'large risks'
for the natural world, studies show," CarbonBrief,
[[https://www.carbonbrief.org/geoengineering-carries-large-risks-for-natural-world-studies-show

They find that [[implementing]{.mark} BECCS [within safe
boundaries]{.mark} could [allow for negative emissions]{.mark} of [up to
60m tonnes of carbon a year]{.mark}. This corresponds to [**less than
1%** of current global CO2 emissions]{.mark},]{.underline} Heck
[says]{.mark}.

Taking risks

The [researchers]{.mark} also estimated how much carbon could be
captured if BECCS was [implemented]{.mark} [within "risky"
boundaries]{.mark}. This definition [[**allowed further damage**
to]{.mark} the [planetary boundaries]{.mark}, while [still
preventing]{.mark} a [move into]{.mark} the "[high risk"
zone]{.mark}]{.underline} (see earlier graphic).

This would allow for negative emissions of around 1.2bn to 6.3bn tonnes
of carbon, depending on the type of bioenergy that is used, the
researchers found.

[[Achieving]{.mark} the [highest]{.mark} amount of [negative
emissions]{.mark} would [require]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the [conversion]{.mark} of biomass to hydrogen with carbon capture and
storage. But the **[technology]{.mark} [needed to facilitate]{.mark} the
[conversion]{.mark} of biomass to hydrogen is [still far from being
viable]{.mark}**,]{.underline} Heck says.

However, implementing BECCS within risky boundaries could have [[major
consequences]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [environment]{.mark}]{.underline},
she adds:

"The risky scenarios imply [substantial risk of triggering negative
Earth system feedback]{.mark} and might [[undermine]{.mark} the
[stability and resilience]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of the Earth
system."

Among impacts, the introduction of BECCS within risky limits could
[[cause]{.mark} [global forest cover]{.mark} to [fall by **10%**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [biodiversity "intactness"]{.mark} to [fall by
**7%**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is because a large amount of land
would need to be converted to biofuel plantations, Heck says.

On top of this, the additional [water demand]{.mark} derived from all of
the newly created BECCS plantations could be more than [[**double** that
required by global agriculture]{.underline}]{.mark}, Hecks adds.

The new research confirms earlier findings that BECCS may have a
"[[**significant adverse impact** on land and
freshwater]{.underline}]{.mark}", [says Prof Pete Smith]{.mark}, chair
in plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen, who was not
involved in the research. He tells Carbon Brief:

Finding 'the solution'

The [[findings show]{.mark} that dampening global warming through the
[use of]{.mark} solar [engineering]{.mark} could [come with]{.mark}
"[many]{.mark} possible [risks]{.mark}]{.underline}", says
[Robock]{.mark}. This suggests that [[cutting global emissions]{.mark}
would be the [best way of limiting future climate
change]{.mark},]{.underline} he [says]{.mark}:

"The **[[solution]{.mark} to global warming [is
mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is [**[not too late to rapidly
switch to wind and solar power]{.mark}** and [rapidly reduce]{.mark} our
[emissions of CO2]{.mark} to the atmosphere]{.underline}."

Mitigating climate change through the [use of BECCS]{.mark} also [comes
with "substantial"]{.mark} [risks]{.mark}, [says]{.mark} [Heck]{.mark}:

"It would be risky to rely on BECCS as a strategy to achieve the Paris
Agreement. [[Notable]{.mark} [negative emissions]{.mark} from biomass
plantations [come at]{.mark} the **[expense of enormous pressures
on]{.mark} the [global environment as a whole]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"In order to achieve climate goals, it is now **[[essential to
immediately reduce CO2 emissions]{.mark}, [instead of]{.mark} using
[harmful technologies to compensate for]{.mark} a [more leisurely
pace]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

### Marine Geoengineering Fails

#### \[Generic\] Marine-based geoengineering sucks

As with mineral-based OAE, [enhanced weathering]{.mark} would [require
large-scale mining]{.mark} roughly [equivalent to today\'s global coal
mining industry]{.mark}, which would [exacerbate]{.mark} habitat
degradation and loss and have [deleterious impacts]{.mark} on
freshwater. Also, similarly to OAE, enhanced weathering without
additional mining has been proposed. Using industrial and mine waste to
achieve enhanced weathering on land, like with OAE, comes with
uncertainties about the ecological toxicity impacts of spreading crushed
uncharacterized materials over land-based ecosystems and agricultural
lands.

[Biomass]{.mark}-based CDR technologies would [directly damage marine
and terrestrial ecosystems]{.mark}. Biochar uses pyrolysis to
theoretically sequester carbon from feedstocks, including crop and wood
residues, manure, tires, plastics, municipal waste, and sewage. Each
feedstock [poses]{.mark} [unique ecotoxicity risks through]{.mark} the
[bioaccumulation of toxins]{.mark} taken up by plants grown in
biochar-amended soils or through the inhalation of particles associated
with production and long-term breakdown. A popularly cited study claims
this [technology could]{.mark} theoretically [capture up to 12 percent
of]{.mark} [annual]{.mark} anthropogenic [greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} this would [require converting over 170
million hectares]{.mark} of tropical grasslands into biomass
plantations.\" This is roughly the size of Libya, the sixteenth-largest
nation in the world by landmass. In addition to this large-scale,
unsustainable conversion of biodiverse lands, achieving idealized
[deployment]{.mark} would [require]{.mark} [realizing 100
percent]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [production potential]{.mark} of
abandoned, degraded cropland [for biomass crops]{.mark}, as well as
using 25 percent of all cattle manure and 90 percent of pig and poultry
manure as feedstock.\" [Pyrolysis facilities emit pollution]{.mark} in
the area, which may [negatively impact biodiversity and human
health]{.mark}. The permit application for a [proposed facility
in]{.mark} Saratoga, [New York]{.mark} (USA) that would produce biochar
from sewage sludge exemplifies the emission of such harmful pollutants
in its request to [emit]{.mark} the following toxins: per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances ([PFAS]{.mark}), naphthalene[, arsenic,
cadmium, lead, mercury, hydrogen fluoride]{.mark}, and particulate
matter.º1

[Implementing]{.mark} large-scale BECCS would [have even greater
land-use implications]{.mark}. [Idealized]{.mark} [BECCS]{.mark}
intended to keep to the Paris Agreement\'s warming limits would [require
cultivating up to 3 billion hectares of productive land]{.mark} -
[roughly]{.mark} equivalent to [twice]{.mark} the [world\'s current
total]{.mark} [cultivated lands]{.mark}.\* Biomass plantations have been
shown to negatively impact biodiversity, including increased exposure to
and decreased resilience to diseases, as well as habitat and food source
loss. These impacts contribute to declines in the richness of plant and
animal species,93 decreasing the resilience of ecosystems due to loss of
genetic diversity. The inevitable sizable carbon emissions from the
large-scale conversion of land for biomass cultivation would lead to
significant loss of natural areas rich in biodiversity as well as
colonize productive crop and grazing lands for carbon sequestration at
the risk of increased food insecurity and loss of ecosystem functions.

[[Atmosphere-based geoengineering techn]{.mark}ologies would [have

[risks]{.mark} associated with [light dimming and]{.mark} the threat of

damages]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\'\*

[[Simulations show]{.mark} that [even if]{.mark} light dimming- which
describes the effect of Earth receiving less solar radiation - were
[globally perfectly uniform]{.mark} using stratospheric aerosol
injection (SAI), [surface temperatures]{.mark} would [**not uniformly
fall** to]{.mark} either [preindustrial or current

dimming would reduce the temperature gradient between the equator and
the poles, [[result]{.mark}ing [in excess cooling in]{.mark} the
[tropics]{.mark}, [excess warming in]{.mark} the [poles]{.mark}, or both
compared to existing conditions. This is significant as it signals that
[even if]{.mark} planetary [cooling]{.mark} were [achieved]{.mark},

Geo-engineering proponents often suggest that volcanic eruptions are an
innocuous natural analog for stratospheric injection of sulfate
aerosols. The 1991 [eruption of Mount Pinatubo]{.mark} on the Philippine
island of Luzon, which injected 20 megatons of sulfur dioxide gas into
the stratosphere, [[produced a sulfate aerosol cloud]{.mark} that is
[said to have caused global cooling]{.mark} for a couple of years
without adverse effects.]{.underline} **[[However]{.mark}, [researchers
at]{.mark} the [National Center for Atmospheric Research showed]{.mark}
in 2007 that the Pinatubo [eruption caused large hydrological
responses]{.mark},]{.underline}** including reduced precipitation, soil
moisture, and river flow in many regions.5 [Simulations of the climate
response to volcanic eruptions have also shown [large impacts on
regional climate]{.mark},]{.underline} but whether these are good
analogs for the geoengineering response requires further investigation.

Scientists have also [seen]{.mark} volcanic eruptions in the tropics
produce [[changes in atmospheric circulation]{.mark}, [causing **winter
warming**]{.mark} over continents in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as
eruptions at high latitudes weaken the Asian and African monsoons,
causing **[reduced precipitation]{.mark}**.6 In fact, the
eight-month-long eruption of the Laki fissure in Iceland in 1783--1784
contributed to **[famine]{.mark}** in Africa, India, and
Japan.]{.underline}

If scientists and engineers were able to inject smaller amounts of
stratospheric aerosols than result from volcanic eruptions, how would
they affect summer wind and precipitation patterns? Could attempts to
geoengineer isolated regions (say, the Arctic) be confined there?
Scientists need to investigate these scenarios. [[At]{.mark} the fall
2007 [American Geophysical Union meeting]{.mark}, researchers presented
preliminary findings from **[several]{.mark} different [climate
model]{.mark}**[s]{.mark} that simulated geoengineering schemes and
[found]{.mark} that [they reduced precipitation over wide

[calculated]{.mark} that [the [additional acidity caused by sulfate

quantity is the total amount of [acid]{.mark} that [reaches]{.mark} the
[ground]{.mark}, including both wet (acid rain, snow, and fog) and dry
deposition (acidic gases and particles). Any additional acid deposition

#### Advancing geoengineering would undermine long-term climate justice

Jennie **Stephens 25**, Professor of Sustainable Science and Policy at
Northeastern University, bachelor's degree in Environmental Science and
Public Policy from Harvard, PhD in Environmental Science and Engineering
from the California Institute of Technology. ("Climate Justice and the
Dangers of Solar Geoengineering", Geoengineering and Climate Change,

The legitimizing of solar geoengineering is emerging as a major threat
to climate justice.\
[Solar geoengineering is the ultimate "technical fix]{.underline}"
\[4.17\] \[4.18\] \[4.19\]; it [does nothing to\
address the cause of climate change]{.underline}, and the [social,
political and ecological risks of advancing]{.underline} this [cannot be
understated]{.underline} \[4.13\]. [[Solar
geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [[creates]{.mark} a
[mechanism for powerful elites to manipulate]{.mark} the Earth's
[climate system for their advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is [[no
way]{.mark} [for this tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[to benefit
all]{.underline}]{.mark} regions of [[the world
equally]{.underline}]{.mark}, so if and when it was deployed, some
places may experience climate benefits but other areas could be worse
off. [[Because]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Earth's systems are so complex
and interconnected, attempts to manipulate]{.mark} the [climate would
have unpredictable cascading impacts]{.mark}.]{.underline} Among the
many potential unintended consequences, changes to the Earth's
hydrological cycle could, for example, disrupt the monsoon season which
would threaten agriculture, reduce food production, and restrict
drinking water access \[4.16\]. Another danger is that the prospect of
[this [non- transformative tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[could
continue to slow down]{.mark} and detract from [larger systemic changes
to address climate injustices and human suffering.]{.mark}]{.underline}\
Although those advocating for solar geoengineering often qualify their
advocacy by saying that advancing this technology should not reduce the
urgency for other responses to the climate crisis, them saying that does
not mean that it is not. Given that [[many]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
[[strong]{.mark}est [supporters]{.mark}]{.underline} of solar
geoengineering [[are tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[billionaires who
are NOT advocating for]{.underline}]{.mark} or investing in [social,
[political]{.mark} or economic [changes as a response]{.mark} to
climate]{.underline} change, it is clear that the [[potential of solar
geo]{.mark}engineering is [diverting]{.mark}]{.underline} interest and
[[investment in more transformative changes]{.underline}]{.mark}.\
[The [claim that just because]{.mark} the [scientists advocating]{.mark}
for solar geoengineering [care about climate mitigation, solar
geoengineering deployment will not detract]{.mark} from other climate
mitigation efforts [is naïve]{.mark}.]{.underline} This claim [[falsely
assumes]{.mark}]{.underline} that the intentions and [[commitments
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[scientists]{.mark} who develop a
technology [shape how the tech]{.mark}nology [is deployed]{.mark} once
it is developed]{.underline} \[4.20\]. This claim also misrepresents and
[[idealizes]{.mark} the [power of]{.mark} the [scientists
advocating]{.mark} for solar geoengineering research.]{.underline}
Despite their confidence in knowing how the world works, [it [needs to
be acknowledged]{.mark} that [the decision of]{.mark}]{.underline}
whether, when and how to [[deploy]{.mark} solar [geoengineering will not
be made by the scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} who are advancing the
technology \[4.20\]. It is [much [more likely]{.mark}]{.underline} that
authoritarian leaders like Donald [[Trump or]{.underline}]{.mark}
Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, or powerful technology
entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, are [[among]{.mark} those [most likely
to]{.mark}]{.underline} be attracted to [[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
this [climate-manipulating tech]{.underline}nology. Because of its
non-transformative qualities, the [[speculative idea of future solar
geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark} is [also [likely to continue to be
appropriated b]{.mark}y]{.underline} corporate and [[political actors
who seek to delay]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[phase-out of fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline} \[4.20\]. As a technology developed within
the climate isolationist mindset, [solar geoengineering reinforces
climate injustices and slows down]{.underline} the
[transformations]{.underline} that are [necessary to]{.underline} move
humanity on a path toward [climate justice]{.underline} \[4.21\].\
During the past decade, the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [has [become]{.mark} the g[lobal leader in
solar geoengineering research]{.mark}]{.underline}, with multiple
philanthropic efforts [[funding research]{.mark} at major
universities,]{.underline} with the largest solar geoengineering
research program at Harvard. The [Harvard solar geoengineering
program]{.underline} is [funded [by philanthropic
gifts]{.mark}]{.underline} from individuals and foundations, [including
Bill Gates]{.underline} \[4.13\]. Solar geoengineering is also fraught
with ecological and governance risks and investing in this approach is
detracting from efforts for transformative social change \[4.22\]. The
imagined potential of solar geoengineering has created a new pathway for
the rich and powerful to establish additional control over everybody
else as climate impacts worsen \[4.13\]. [[Advocacy for solar
geoengineering research continues to be dominated by white male
scientists from the Global North funded by tech billionaires and elite
philanthropists]{.underline}]{.mark} \[4.23\]. More diverse voices are
needed to expand public discourse beyond the narrow technocratic
narrative that limits authentic deliberation about the risks of
advancing solar geoengineering \[4.9\].

The [[world lacks]{.mark} a [system of global governance that

regulate and [[manage deployment of]{.mark} solar [geoengineering at

geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline} deployment that would [[range from
decades to]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[centuries]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Yet [recent geopolitical crises]{.mark} [suggest growing
instability]{.mark}, worsening ineffectiveness and expanding inequities
in global governance.]{.underline} This has led hundreds of scholars of
global governance and environmental policy to call for an International
Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering. [[Increasing]{.mark}
[superpower hostilities make future collaborative governance of solar
geoengineering deployment unlikely. Given tech]{.mark}nological
[competition between larger economies, solar geoengineering
dev]{.mark}elopment among powerful countries [could lead to an arms
race-like situation]{.mark}]{.underline} in which the [[enforcement of
any rules]{.mark} on deployment of solar geoengineering [would be
impossible.]{.mark}]{.underline} History shows that [[nationalistic
interests often prevent international governance]{.mark},]{.underline}
and it would likely be the powerful and privileged nations that would
control and optimize deployment of solar geoengineering for their own
interests -- at the cost of small and less powerful nations.

#### Global geoengineering governance is impossible in the current geopolitical climate

Frank **Biermann et al. 21**, professor of global sustainability

Our main concern, however, is with the global governance challenges
posed by the confluence of technical, political, and ethical risks of
such large-scale interventions at planetary scale. [We see the
deployment of solar geoengineering as impossible to govern fairly and
effectively in the current international political system, under
assumptions of effective global participation, inclusiveness, and
justice]{.underline}. Other critics have argued in the past that solar
geoengineering is "undesirable, ungovernable, and unattainable" (Hulme,
2014) and incompatible with democratic decision-making (Stephens et al.,
2021; Szerszynski et al., 2013). We share these worries and turn them
into a concrete policy proposal.

Our core concern as governance scholars is that [solar geoengineering at
planetary scale would require complex global decisions on the places and
manner of deployment, the intensity]{.underline} of deployment (i.e.,
the degree of cooling), [the duration]{.underline} of deployment, [and
the responsibility and compensation for any harm that may be
caused]{.underline} (Jinnah et al., 2019). As solar geoengineering would
impact all countries, fair and just governance would require the
effective control over the deployment of such technologies by all
countries (Holahan & Kashwan, 2019). Importantly, [the type and degree
of deployment would affect different countries differently, and risks
would be unevenly spread]{.underline}. As the specific manner of
deployment would influence the distribution of these risks, [democratic
decision-making at planetary scale would be even more crucial---and even
harder to safeguard in a fair and just manner.]{.underline}

[Globally inclusive decision-making and political control over solar
geoengineering would be especially important for the]{.underline}
poorest and [most vulnerable countries.]{.underline} Six-hundred and
ninety-six million people live in extreme poverty, on less than USD 1.90
a day, and 3.2 billion people live on less than USD 5.50 a day (Aguilar
et al., 2021). Over 820 million people suffer from hunger, which is
equal to one in every nine people worldwide (UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, 2019). [These global poor are extremely vulnerable to any
change in their environment and threatened the most by any
risks]{.underline} or side effects that might result from the deployment
of solar geoengineering at planetary scale. Conversely, the global poor
would also be the first to suffer from drastic climate change. Various
[researchers have argued that this suffering could be alleviated by
solar geoengineering]{.underline} (Harding et al., 2020; Wagner, 2021),
leading some to postulate a moral obligation of industrialized countries
to engage in solar geoengineering research to compensate for past and
current greenhouse gas emissions (Svoboda et al., 2018). [Yet one cannot
achieve climate justice by addressing one aspect of justice and
violating another]{.underline} (Schlosberg & Collins, 2014). [While
historical responsibility]{.underline} for the inequitable impacts of
climate change [is an important demand of climate justice, so is
inclusion and participation in planetary-scale decisions.]{.underline}

Both the all-affected principle of democracy and procedural justice
require governance that is globally inclusive. [Because of the high
vulnerability of the least developed countries and many other countries
in the Global South, their governments would need]{.underline} to have
[decisive control ove]{.underline}r whether and [how to
deploy]{.underline} solar geoengineering technologies. [Yet there is
little evidence to suggest]{.underline} that [countries]{.underline}
most [able to develop tech]{.underline}nologies for solar geoengineering
[would be willing to transfer effective control of such geopolitically
important tech]{.underline}nologies [to the most vulnerable countries in
the Global South]{.underline}. Considering the stakes for the Global
South, mere consultation of least developed and other developing
countries over technology development and potential deployment---as
suggested by some proponents of solar geoengineering---would not be
sufficient. [Full knowledge integration for the Global South is
important]{.underline}, for sure (Rahman et al., 2018; Winickoff et al.,
2015). [But eventually, it is effective and enforceable political
control by the Global South that would be required.]{.underline}

To guarantee such globally inclusive and effective governance,
[countries powerful enough]{.underline} to develop and deploy
technologies for solar geoengineering w[ould need to place their
tech]{.underline}nologies [under the control of]{.underline} effective
multilateral [institutions, with guarantees of collective veto rights
for the most vulnerable nations.]{.underline} [The current world order
seems unfit to reach such far-reaching agreements]{.underline} on fair
and effective political control over solar geoengineering deployment.
The United Nations General Assembly, as the highest organ of the world
organization, declared climate change in 1988 a "common concern of
humankind", but the assembly lacks enforcement powers and its decisions
are not binding. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) with
its United Nations Environment Assembly, which deals with many
environmental issues, is constrained in its mandate and operational
capacity. In 2019, a proposed UNEP resolution to undertake a cautionary
assessment of geoengineering options, including solar geoengineering,
was blocked by the United States, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia (Chemnick,
2019). Like the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change also lacks the institutional
force that could guarantee just, equitable and effective multilateral
control over deployment of solar geoengineering technologies at
planetary scale.

In addition, [any global decisions on the details of the
deployment]{.underline} of solar geoengineering [are unlikely to find
consensus. Disagreements about]{.underline} some
[parameters]{.underline}---for example, the degree of cooling, the
duration of deployment, or the specific latitudes and distribution of
aerosols---[will inevitably occur. Such situations would require clear
and reliable decision-making procedures for solving these
disagreements.]{.underline} Most United Nations bodies follow the
principle of sovereign equality, which grants each country one vote. It
is unlikely that technologically advanced nations such as the United
States or Russia would accept such a system of oversight for
planetary-scale use of solar geoengineering. [Universally accepted
alternatives to one-country-one-vote decision-making]{.underline},
however, [are not in sight]{.underline}.

Importantly, [any decision by a global body]{.underline} to deploy solar
geoengineering technologies [would require enforcement power in case
some countries disagree with a majority decision and threaten
counteractions.]{.underline} The literature even discusses scenarios of
counter-geoengineering by countries that disagree with the solar
geoengineering programs of other countries (Heyen et al., 2019). [The
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [S]{.underline}ecurity
[C]{.underline}ouncil [has a mandate to act]{.underline} if it deems a
situation to be a threat to international peace and security. [Yet the
Security Council]{.underline}, with five countries having permanent
seats and veto rights, [does not enjoy the global legitimacy to
effectively regulate future global deployment of solar geoengineering
technologies. And it cannot take actions against any of its five
permanent members]{.underline} (i.e., China, France, Russia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States).

These concerns about formal governance also arise with more informal
governance arrangements, such as multi-stake- holder dialogues or
voluntary codes of conduct (Jinnah et al., 2019). Such arrangements face
similar barriers to entry by less powerful actors, and they risk
contributing to premature legitimization of these speculative
technologies as well (Conca, 2019). Science networks in general are
heavily biased towards a few industrialized countries, with less
economically powerful countries having little or no direct control over
them (Biermann & Möller, 2019; Stephens et al., 2021). Moreover,
[technocratic governance based on expert commissions or scientific
modeling of distributive consequences cannot adjudicate complex global
conflicts over values, risk allocation, and differences in risk
acceptance]{.underline} (Flegal & Gupta, 2018).

In short, [the deployment of solar geoengineering at planetary scale
would require entirely new international organizations with convincing
means of democratic control and unprecedented enforcement powers. Such
organizations do not exist.]{.underline}

[Without effective]{.underline} global and democratic
[controls]{.underline}, however, [the geopolitics of possible unilateral
deployment]{.underline} of solar geoengineering [would be complex and
frightening.]{.underline} International law remains vague when it comes
to development and deployment of such technologies (Reynolds, 2019).
[In]{.underline} the [absence of effective governance mechanisms, expert
debates]{.underline} and scientific research assessments [within a few
industrialized countries could develop into a form]{.underline} of "de
facto governance" (Gupta & Möller, 2019), [but]{.underline} often in
ways [not legitimized]{.underline} or supported [by developing countries
in particular]{.underline} (Biermann & Möller, 2019). Given the
anticipated low monetary costs of some of these technologies, such as
stratospheric aerosols injection, a few countries could engage in solar
geoengineering unilaterally or in small coalitions even when other
countries oppose such deployment---a possibility economists have
presented as the "free-driver effect" (Wagner & Weitzman, 2012). Some
proponents from the Global North see it even explicitly as an advantage
of solar geoengineering that it could be deployed "without broad
international cooperation" (Reynolds, 2021).

Last but not least, [speculative hopes about]{.underline} [the future
availability of solar geoengineering]{.underline} technologies could
[threaten commitments to mitigation and reduce incentives for
governments, businesses, and societies to do their utmost to achieve
decarbonization]{.underline} or carbon neutrality as soon as possible
(Asayama et al., 2019). Powerful industry interests, notably from the
energy sector, have long invested in delaying stringent climate
policies; seeking out technical alternatives such as carbon dioxide
removal and sequestration (Carton et al., 2020; Lamb et al., 2020; Low &
Boettcher, 2020; McLaren & Markusson, 2020); or denying the phenomenon
of climate change altogether (Oreskes & Conway, 2010). The [looming
possibility of future solar geoengineering could become a powerful
argument for]{.underline} energy companies and [oil-dependent countries
to further delay decarbonization policies. This risk is particularly
high now]{.underline}, with a surge of countries announcing their
intention to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier.

[President [Trump]{.mark} announced in a post on social media on Tuesday
a trade deal with Japan that sets \"reciprocal\" tariffs at
15%.]{.underline}

[The post [celebrated]{.mark} what he described as \"[a massive

U.S.**]{.mark} Trump said that as part of the deal, Japan will further
open their country to trade including cars, trucks, rice and other
agricultural products.]{.underline}

\"This Deal will create Hundreds of Thousands of Jobs --- There has

[Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru [Ishiba acknowledged the **new trade**

The U.S. ran a nearly \$70 billion trade imbalance on goods with Japan

It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring specifically to
the proposed \$44 billion Alaska LNG project. That project would consist
of an 800-mile (1,300-km) pipeline carrying gas to a planned
liquefaction plant for export.

[Trump's announcement of the venture came in comments to lawmakers at

["[We concluded the]{.mark} one [deal]{.mark}... and now we're going to

### AT AI/Blockchain

#### NO Singularity -- infinite feedback loops are impossible (laws of thermodynamics) and at minimum take centuries. AI already reached its plateau. 

Craig Woods 2024, (served as the Director of Infectious Disease &
Biosecurity Projects for Arizona State University\'s Complex Adaptive
Systems Initiative (CASI)), "The AI singularity: Really, guys?", Aug 23,
2024, Medium,
https://medium.com/%40hindmost99/the-ai-singularity-really-guys-5012ee5cecff

[[This is all]{.mark} quite sexy and cool to imagine --- and
[absurd]{.mark}. I mean --- [physically impossible (not merely
implausible]{.mark}), [just as dumb as a perpetual motion machine or
time travel.]{.mark} Fun to imagine for science fiction stories, but not
something to plan for, or try to create. And, more than that, given the
real world 'physics' of feedback loops --- potentially catastrophic to
attempt.]{.underline}

Where does it come from, this concept of a singularity? Simple
extrapolation of historical trends. It took hundreds of thousands of
years for humanity to move from tool-less existence to the age of simple
tool use, tens of thousands to move from simple tools to early
industrial age, only a century to reach the information age, and now
mere decades to begin to see the glimmers of machine intelligence
capable of reproducing human-level cognitive tasks. Why wouldn't this
trend of accelerating evolution continue, following the exponential
curve up ever faster?

[The simple answer is 'the physics of complex systems', but given the
extraordinary complexity of these ideas --- of the definition and
function of intelligence, of the social, political and economic systems
required to develop intelligence --- it isn't simple to elaborate. And
the physics involved --- 'non-linear systems dynamics', '[complex
systems theory',]{.mark} 'chaos theory' --- [isn't quite]{.mark} the
[clear cut]{.mark}-and-dried kind of [physics]{.mark} like Newtons laws,
relativity or even quantum mechanics(!). We are still struggling as a
species to elucidate and internalize the constraints that arise from
complexity and feedback loops --- we don't even have a good name for the
subtle, not-expressed-as-equations-but-nonetheless-binding rules that we
have discovered about systems of things. But [those rules are real and
binding]{.mark}, and mean that the [exponential growth of
intelligence]{.mark}, biological or machine, that arguably started back
in pre-historic times [will stop before]{.mark} intelligent machines
trigger a true '[singularity]{.mark}'.]{.underline}

Limits to growth

First, the simple stuff:

[Feedback [loops always stop]{.mark} themselves. They [either exhaust
their supply of]{.mark} one or more [inputs]{.mark} to the loop, [or
they destabilize their environment]{.mark} or infrastructure they rely
on for growth so that growth stops, and often collapses.]{.underline}

Another way to say this is that there are always 'limits to growth'.
This is a rule with a fraught (and increasingly poignant) history, first
elucidated in popular form in the book of the same title back in the
1970's. A group of graduate students used the primitive computing
infrastructure of the 1970's to define a set of abstract models of a
global social-political-economic system, with a set of interdependencies
and feedbacks that were a crude but useful representation of the real
world. They then ran simulations of hundreds of years, using a variety
of parameters, to see how the systems evolved. And they observed that
the system nearly always sustained growth --- sometimes exponentially
--- but also that the growth always eventually leveled off, and often
'crashed'. All but 2 of the scenarios that they modeled showed continued
exponential growth for a time, but then the growth didn't just stop, the
models always showed the population crashing back to levels much lower
than the starting point of the simulation. As far as they could see,
unless civilization preemptively aborted the exponential growth by
'voluntarily' adopting strict limits on growth, the growth would stop
catastrophically, with a great 'die back' of humanity. And using the
models, they were able to see that the reason for this inevitable end to
exponential growth, the reason that there were never true
'singularities', was the simple statement above. [A feedback
[loop]{.mark} [requires inputs]{.mark} (that's the Second Law of
Thermodynamics), [and]{.mark} it [produces]{.mark} side effects or
'[waste]{.mark}' outputs (also the [Second Law of
Thermodynamics]{.mark}). If the growth becomes exponential, [it requires
exponentially increasing inputs to be sustained, and it produces
exponentially increasing waste]{.mark} streams as a consequence of its
loop. At some point, either [the loop exhausts]{.mark} one or more
[sources, or]{.mark} it [saturates]{.mark} one or more ['sinks' that are
absorbing the wastes]{.mark}. Either of those will cause the growth to
cease, and often trigger the collapse]{.underline}.

We're all familiar now with the logic of global climate change --- the
increasing generation of carbon dioxide (a waste output of combustion),
and chemical synthesis, and even food production, since all fertilizer
is produced from natural gas synthesis, which emits carbon dioxide as a
waste product is collecting in the atmosphere (and in the oceans),
causing increased global temperatures (and ocean acidification). And if
we were to continue on the exponential growth rates of the past few
centuries, both in population and in the intensity of our energy use per
capita, modelling suggests that we could make the earth far less
habitable --- less land in climates suitable for agriculture, meaning
less food, meaning fewer people (and also potentially far less ocean
life due to the acidification and warming, meaning a lot less food...)

That's the canonical example of a complex system with feedback loops
(industrial society undergoing exponential population growth and
industrialization) poisoning the environment in a way that will stop the
exponential growth. (Side note: the climate models used for the early
climate change modeling were refined and extended versions of the models
that were used in the original Limits to Growth studies). But it is also
an example of the difficulty of both formulating the 'physical laws' of
complex systems in a compelling way: the original Limits to Growth book
was widely mocked and dismissed, and even with enormous investments in
validating the climate modeling that shows the dire consequences of the
carbon dioxide emissions, and with the dire record-annihilating
temperatures we have observed, the global consensus that there truly are
fundamental limits to growth is only weakly held, and still routinely
attacked or undermined. People, especially people with vested interests,
don't want to accept that humanity must accept limits, and don't
acknowledge the existence of such ephemeral constraints as "there are
limits to growth". And so, society as a whole continues to increase our
emissions, and undermines the attempts to reduce carbon emissions at
every turn.

Or, in the 'techo-utopian' branch of thought, the very very smart people
say 'technology will solve that', or specifically 'after the
singularity, none of that will matter any more, because we won't pollute
any more, and we won't need to consume (food \| water \| air )'. And,
they continue, it doesn't have to go on forever --- just long enough to
get to the point where the intelligence is smart enough to mitigate the
side effects, and develop adaptations to maintain the supplies needed to
continue the growth. And once we are no longer bound by biology or
energy constraints or those pesky ineffable laws like 'there are limits
to growth', well, we will attain a literal heaven on earth.

'Hidden (more like 'Ignored') Assumptions:

[There are a [TON of hidden assumptions]{.mark} in the concept of the
'machine intelligence singularity' that are necessary to make such a
scenario possible. I'm pretty sure this is not even close to a complete
list, but it doesn't have to be --- [even]{.mark} these [basic
assumptions make a singularity]{.mark} either unlikely or
[impossible]{.mark}:]{.underline}

a\) That there even is such a thing as a machine intelligence that is
'smarter' than humans, specifically at designing intelligence, to start
the feedback loop. This is one of the more reasonable assumptions to
make. We already use a variety of tools to assist in chip design, for
example, and we are seeing that generative AI can take an English
specification and produce (mostly) functional code. But it is still a
huge leap to say we can build a system that will be able to design a
'better brain'. What does 'smarter' mean, though? [So far most of the
[machine]{.mark} intelligence we can build [does a small subset of what
humans do]{.mark}, but faster and at a larger scale, or for generative
AI --- [it merely mimics the patterns]{.mark} that it has observed in
human communications. [Neither]{.mark} of those seem likely to [produce
truly innovative]{.mark} or ground breaking 'new' [intelligence]{.mark}
that can solve problems that humans cannot solve.]{.underline} I have a
separate essay in mind to discuss exactly how (and whether) AI can truly
help humanity --- what problems do we need it to solve, and how likely
it seems that it will solve them. For now, let's just say I'm deeply
skeptical that machine intelligence will be able to do much to help
humanity with our most critical challenges --- and is far more likely to
exacerbate them.

b\) That even if we manage to build an AI that is smarter than a single
human it will be smart enough to trigger the feedback loop. This is the
wrong bar, clearly. Humanity is advancing in our design of machine
intelligence collectively, leveraging the knowledge and efforts of tens
of thousands of humans with specialized knowledge and skills. In the
short term, AI will augment the rate of advance without reaching the
goal of being smarter than any one human. [And being smarter than a
single human won't be a step-change in capabilities --- we [will]{.mark}
[need an intelligence that is smarter than humanity
collectively]{.mark}. That is a [threshold]{.mark} that [is several
orders of magnitude harder than being smarter than a single
human.]{.mark}]{.underline}

c\) That intelligence is somehow an unlimited domain, or space. That
simply by increasing the number of 'nodes', or 'neurons', or by applying
ever more sophisticated algorithms, you can solve ever harder problems.
This is inferred by extrapolating from animals to humans --- look at the
great leap that was made when humans evolved our sophisticated
cognition, and then at the accelerating pace of technological evolution
we have demonstrated over the past 200 years (for example). Surely, this
is exponential growth, and we can extrapolate that there is still room
to go --- greater heights to scale, bigger brains to evolve, right?

This is not a gimmee, though. [[All complex systems]{.mark}, organic or
mechanical, [are subject to diminishing returns]{.mark} where after a
certain point, just making things bigger, or [adding more inputs makes
less and less difference]{.mark}, until you reach a physical
limit]{.underline}. [It is very plausible, and possibly the null
hypothesis that, at the very least, ever greater intelligences [will
require exponentially greater inputs --- energy, space, cooling, data,
training time]{.mark} --- to continue to increase. And there may be a
plateau in what can be achieved, or the size and complexity of problems
that can be solved purely by building bigger and better intelligence.
The limits imposed by [physical laws don't change]{.mark} (much) [based
on how intelligent you are]{.mark} --- [they]{.mark} are physical
limits, that [always apply.]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, it is reasonable to believe that humanity itself is not the
'apex' of what is possible --- we evolved to the point where we could
outcompete other mammals in our ecological niches, not to reach the
highest form of possible cognition. So, lets give this to the
Singularity buffs. We'll assume that there are better intelligences that
are possible. But we have to keep in mind those diminishing returns, and
escalating costs. And, that the scaling of intelligence may reach limits
beyond which we simply cannot afford to build and operate the greater
intelligences, even utilizing whatever improvements the better
intelligences provide.

We have certainly lived through very exciting times, where computing has
completely reconfigured our world in just a few short decades, and it
shows no signs of slowing down, especially with the advent of generative
AI. You can say that we are already in the singularity, in a way, our
lives already nearly unrecognizable to people who lived a mere two
hundred years ago. [Except, [we]{.mark} do [see signs of slowing
down]{.mark} of the ever increasing power of computation to refashion
our world. Moore's law (or the more salient "more-than-Moore's" law) has
slowed down in the last few years; Generative [AI improvements are
seeing a tail-off in the rate at which larger training sets produce
improved results.]{.mark}]{.underline}

d\) that there will not be any limits that slow or stop the exponential
feedback. This is a very bad assumption, a 'non-physical' assumption.
Exponential growth from feedback loops always slows and stops. Either
the growth exhausts the resources that feed the loop, or the growth
destabilizes the system on which the growth depends. Even nuclear
fission, the most potent and primal runaway feedback loop stops when it
consumes all of the available fissionable material, or the material is
scattered by the massive energy emissions of the fission reaction.
Population explosions are limited by exhaustion of food supplies, fire
burns through the available fuel --- every system has limits that
eventually moderate and stall the exponential growth. The one actual
example of limitless exponential growth (in some sense) is an actual
gravitational singularity --- the progressive accretion of mass in a
small enough region that it collapses space/time into an infinitely
dense point. This is the metaphorical model of the machine intelligence
feedback loop, but it is an inapt comparison. Unlike gravitational
singularities, machine intelligence requires (likely exponentially
increasing amounts of) energy, cooling, space, data, money, etc to keep
growing exponentially (even assuming it is possible). And there are
other limits that seem like they will plausibly derail the exponential
growth: poisoning the 'environment' it needs to sustain the investments
in the exponential growth. Here, the environment is likely the entire
world political and economic system. AI is very likely to have
profoundly destabilizing effects on the world socio-political system and
economy. Will the world be able to maintain the ever-escalating costs
needed to sustain an exponential feedback loop in the face of this
dislocation? That is a huge unknown --- we don't even have a good
understanding of how the primitive machine intelligences we have today
are going to impact our world, beyond the evident destructive power they
have on social consensus building and their utility in fostering
autocratic governance models in the hands of oligarchs. Durable mass
unemployment seems to be a highly likely very near term consequence of
even the crude generative AI that we have now --- we've probably already
seen the first small wave of job destruction in the 2023--2024 layoffs
in high tech, and tech companies are internally telling their software
engineers to 'learn a different skill set' because they anticipate
near-total automation of software coding in the very near future.
(Generating code for computer software is very 'easy' for generative AI,
because the rules for the language are much simpler than human
communication, and because there is a ton of 'reuse' in software, giving
the model very clear patterns to learn from. Boring and unoriginal code
is perfectly okay, lowering the bar still further for AI to replace and
economically dislocate software engineers.)

e\) Speed --- one of the implicit assumptions in the singularity lore is
that once the feedback loop is triggered, it will be a matter of a few
years, then months and days before the machine intelligences are
sophisticated enough to re-work human existence. Each new generation of
machine intelligence will create the next in shorter and shorter
windows. This is a completely unrealistic model. As noted above the
systems will require power, cooling, networking, water, and training
time. [If [new]{.mark} generations of computing [hardware are
required]{.mark} it might take decades to re-tool the supply chains,
starting with [new chip fab equipment]{.mark}, then [new fabs]{.mark},
then [deploying the new chips]{.mark} in systems to data centers with
requisite infrastructure to run them. If the assumption of near-zero
turnaround for successive generations relies on full automation of the
entire economy --- well, that will be profoundly destabilizing to the
socio-political system as noted above, and [will take]{.mark} decades
(or [centuries) by itself]{.mark}. It will also require [vast amounts of
raw materials, and the requisite supply chains]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Lets look at how industries advance --- take the automotive industry as
an example. A relatively simple, yet profound change: going from
internal combustion engines to battery-electric power trains (cars are
far simpler to build than computer chips, systems, and networks ). How
long did it take for established auto makers to re-tool to begin
building EV's? A: we don't know yet, but it is more than a decade so
far, and we are only just seeing a small number of automakers reaching
what one might call 'competitive' BEV offerings. Tesla took 13 years to
develop the Model 3, arguably the first mass produced EV. And then what
has happened after that? Tesla built highly automated factories (and
then had to dial it back somewhat when the over-automation actually
reduced the productivity of the assembly lines). But now Tesla is
'stuck' with an assembly line tailored to build the 2 major models that
they now how to produce, and they (apparently) can't update or upgrade
their designs easily. And here we see the frustrating limits of the
'limits to growth' rule. None of the above feels like 'proof'. None of
these observations can be expressed in a way that says "the singularity
will not happen", or "the rate of advancement of machine intelligence
will stop by such and such a date, or due to this specific constraint."
In part that is because I am by no means a professional systems modeler
or analyst, and can't even begin to design a specific model to explore
the possible limits that will apply to the development of machine
intelligence. But it is also the nature of the subtlety of the rules for
complex systems. One of the other rules we've learned about complex
systems is that forecasting and predicting the specific 'trajectory' or
path of a sufficiently complex system is impossible beyond a certain
limit --- like trying to predict the weather for a city on a specific
day more than 10 days in advance. There are simply too many moving
parts, too many interactions and too many subtleties that all add up
over time to blur our ability to predict the future. If we build
simplified models with representative feedbacks and interactions, we can
see patterns, or trends, and even potential 'tipping points', but not
with precision. We can know they are there, but not when, or even if, we
will trigger them. And so it is with the machine intelligence
singularity. We can say with confidence that it will hit limits that
will stop the exponential growth, but not specifically which limits, or
when they will take effect --- or how we will react and adapt when we do
hit the limits. It's frustratingly vague, and to some that means that
the rules are useless, or even that the rules do not exist. But they do.
We are bound by them just as surely as we feel the pull of gravity,
though there effects are far more subtle, and, sorry to overuse the
word, complex. The big, maybe only takeaway here is --- don't plan on a
technological 'singularity' to render all of the current crises we are
dealing with moot. We need to deal with climate change, both by
mitigating it through reduced emissions, and through adaptations like
coping with climate migrations elegantly. Even with that our growth as a
species and a civilization will face ongoing challenges --- fresh water
supply, food production, social stability, ecosystem destruction --- any
one of which could still cause a collapse. We can only escape the limits
to growth conundrum by not growing, either in sheer numbers, or in the
intensity of our resource consumption. Global population will stop
growing and begin declining 'soon', based on current population trends,
but the intensity of our resource consumption is going to keep going up,
resulting in greater impacts on the environment indefinitely.

#### Nuclear energy solves Data centers

**Global Times**, 6-4-20**25**, (is a tabloid publishing in English
since 2009)\"'US-China AI arms race' is a misleading narrative,\" Global
times, https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202506/1335412.shtml?

[Recently, the [US government set out aims to quadruple US nuclear
capacity by 2050]{.mark}. While some Americans believe that nuclear is
the key to winning the AI race, they began to hype that the US
government\'s move will help the US maintain its early AI advantage in
its competition with China. \"[We\'ve got enough electricity to win the
AI arms race]{.mark} with China,\" [Interior Secretary]{.mark} Doug
Burgum [said]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Global Times invited three
Chinese experts to discuss this US policy and the logic behind
it[.]{.underline}

The US government has signed a series of executive orders to hasten the
deployment of new nuclear power reactors. On the surface, this policy
reflects Washington\'s emphasis on revitalizing American manufacturing,
energy security and related technological progress, but the China factor
behind it should cause deep thought. At present, Washington\'s excessive
emphasis on the competition with China and exaggeration of China\'s
economic and technological \"threats\" may not be conducive to the
realization of its goals in the end.

As an efficient and low-carbon form of energy, nuclear energy plays an
important role in the global energy transition[. The [US has the largest
number of nuclear power reactors]{.mark} in the world, with more than 90
in existence, but the [development]{.mark} of nuclear power has [slowed
down]{.mark} in the past few decades [due to]{.mark} high costs, strict
[regulations]{.mark} and public concerns.]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} new
US government\'s [e]{.mark}xecutive [o]{.mark}rders aim to revitalize
the nuclear power industry by [simplify]{.mark}ing [approval processes,
providing financial support and promoting]{.mark} small modular reactor
([SMR]{.mark}) technology]{.underline}. [This move aims not only to meet
domestic energy needs, but is also closely related to the rapid
development of AI. According to the International Energy Agency,
estimated global [data center]{.mark} electricity [consumption]{.mark}
in 2022 [was]{.mark} around [1]{.mark} to 1.3 [percent]{.mark} [of
global]{.mark} final [electricity]{.mark} demand, and it is expected to
double by 2030. [Nuclear power, with its high energy density and low

The nuclear advantage

[[Nuclear energy presents a]{.mark} potential [solution for]{.mark}
meeting some of the growing electricity demands of [data
centers]{.mark}, with its reliable and clean energy profile. [It
provided over 19% of the United States' electricity in 2024]{.mark},
despite [representing less than 8% of the nation's total operating
capacit]{.mark}y.2 Some potential advantages include:]{.underline}

[Reliable baseload power: Nuclear power plants provide firm baseload
power, operating 24/7 regardless of weather conditions. Their
[capacity]{.mark} factor, [exceeding 92.5%,]{.mark} [outperforms]{.mark}
other sources like [natural gas]{.mark} (56%) and renewables like wind
(35%) and solar (25%).3 This [reliability is important for data
centers]{.mark}, helping to ensure uninterrupted operations and maximize
return on investments, especially for AI and generative AI
applications.]{.underline}

[High energy density: Nuclear fuel boasts a [high energy
density]{.mark}. [A small amount of nuclear fuel can generate a vast
amount of electricity]{.mark}, [minimizing fuel storage requirements and
reducing transportation needs]{.mark}. This efficiency can translate to
a smaller physical footprint and enhanced sustainability.]{.underline}

[Scalable power output: A [single]{.mark} nuclear [reactor]{.mark}
typically [generates 800 megawatts]{.mark} (MW) or more of electricity,
readily [meeting the power demands of even the largest data centers (50
MW to 100 MW]{.mark}) and the burgeoning requirements of AI-focused
facilities (up to 5,000 MW).4]{.underline}

Low-carbon emissions: Nuclear power is a clean energy source that
produces virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation.5

[Enhanced land use efficiency: Nuclear [power plants require relatively
small land areas]{.mark} compared to other energy sources.6 This
efficiency [is important for data center colocation and can help to
optimize land use]{.mark} and minimize environmental
impact.]{.underline}

More than half of Russians know that Russia is at the top of the list of

Russia is in top ten richest countries of the world.

Those who ascribe the leadership to Russia are largely Russians aged
35-44 (58%), as well as respondents aged 45-59 and 60 and over (56% and
52% respectively), Russians aged 25-34 (49%). Young respondents aged
18-24 are less likely to recognize Russia's leadership in this issue
(35%).

[[Information concerning the Russia's resource wealth evokes positive

The country used to have a high betweenness centrality in the gas

### Prolif Good

#### The nuclear threat of extinction is overblown.

Paul **Poast 25** (associate professor in the Department of Political
Science at the University of Chicago, 04/18/2025, "Nuclear Proliferation
Fears May Be Overblown,"
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/nuclear-proliferation-trump/?one-time-read-code=3668861753109920162503,
World Politics Review, accessed 7/23/25.) //KG

We are not on the verge of a nuclear free world and may well [never
achieve](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/nuclear-weapons-nobel-peace-prize/) that
aim. While this is worrisome enough, there is a new concern: that the
world is on the cusp of heading in the [opposite
direction](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/11/trump-says-he-fears-nuclear-weapons-so-why-is-he-making-them-more-popular-00278790).
Though this week saw the resumption of talks between the United States
and Iran to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, whether those
talks will succeed is far from certain. After all, it was the first
Trump administration that ended the original Iran nuclear deal, which
had been signed in 2015.

But Iran is not even the primary worry in this brave new world of
nuclear proliferation risk. States that had long been under the U.S.
nuclear umbrella, from Japan to Poland to South Korea and Germany, are
all considering developing their own nuclear weapons. The reelection of
Donald Trump and his administration's insistence that long-standing U.S.
allies do more for their defense while the U.S. does less is leading
these states to question the U.S. commitment to their security. As South
Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul remarked recently, Seoul is indeed
considering a nuclear "[Plan
B](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/03/13/trump-concerns-lead-south-korea-to-say-developing-nukes-not-off-table/80837029007/)"
in light of the unpredictability of relying on the U.S. nuclear
deterrent.

Some existing nuclear powers are trying to step into the vacuum and
offer non-nuclear allies reassurance. France and Britain, the other two
NATO allies with nuclear weapons, have offered to replace the U.S.
umbrella in Europe. But from the perspective of states like Germany and
Poland, that may simply replace one unsteady nuclear armed ally with
another. France's Emmanuel Macron
may [offer](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-address-nation-late-wednesday-2025-03-05/) "protection
of our allies on the European continent through our (nuclear)
deterrence," but would he actually authorize the use of the bomb when
the fallout could feasibly reach French soil? For non-nuclear states,
self-help seems like the safest bet.

The possibility of the number of nuclear states suddenly proliferating
seems to be coming at the worst time. The world was already on edge from
the prospect of seeing nuclear weapons used in conflict for the first
time in 80 years, largely due to Russia's rattling of its nuclear saber.
Whether placing its weapons on [higher
alert](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/russia-nuclear-threat-ukraine-war/) or [revising](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/russia-nuclear-doctrine-threats/) its
nuclear doctrine to make first use more likely, Russia's actions have
been unnerving the world. Even if Russia doesn't resort to the use of
large, strategic nuclear weapons against the population centers of
Ukraine or a NATO ally, there has been worry that Russia will use a
smaller
"[tactical](https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war)"
nuclear weapon on the battlefield against Ukrainian forces. The world
could soon have a host of states who similarly place their nuclear
weapons on a hair trigger.

However, it's also possible that now is the best time to witness a
proliferation of nuclear weapons states. **[[Proliferation may not
change much at all and could even prove
stabilizing.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

If states seek the bomb for their own security, specifically because the
nuclear deterrent they long relied upon is no longer in effect, should
that be a worry? While it's
nearly [impossible](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/nuclear-weapons-deterrence/) to
know whether nuclear deterrence will hold**[, it is]{.underline}** also
**[clear]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** the
**[states]{.underline}** that are newly developing the bomb are doing so
out of a need to deter aggression, not bolster aggression.

Indeed, this is exactly why the eminent international relations scholar
Kenneth Waltz
famously [argued](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/05679328108457394) that
[**[nuclear proliferation would actually be a net positive for
humanity]{.underline}**. His logic was grounded in the idea **[that
nuclear weapons are largely defensive weapons]{.underline}**]{.mark}:
given their destructive capacity, states tend only to use them for
punishment purposes as they render the territory on which they are used
uninhabitable. Waltz saw defensive weapons as stabilizing and, hence,
arms races involving defensive weapons should not only be of little
concern, but actually encouraged. The greater the capacity of states to
deter aggression by threatening massive retaliation with nuclear
weapons, the more likely it is that deterrence will hold. This leads to
a bit of a paradox: While an individual nuclear weapon is quite
dangerous, a world full of nuclear weapons is more stable and peaceful
than a world without such weapons. More nuclear weapons should be
welcomed,
not [feared](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-06-15/world-power-and-fear),
according to Waltz.

This logic underpinned John
Mearsheimer's [recommendation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/1993-06-01/case-ukrainian-nuclear-deterrent) in
1993 that Ukraine should retain the large quantity of nuclear weapons it
inherited following the collapse of the Soviet Union. While Ukraine did
not immediately possess the ability to launch those weapons, that
capacity could have been developed and was a lower technological hurdle
than creating the weapons themselves. Possessing the warheads would have
given Ukraine a bargaining chip that it subsequently lacked when Russia
began its aggressive incursions against the country in the mid-2010s.

Similarly, consider the 2003 Iraq War. The ostensible rationale for the
war was,
as [argued](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/us-iraq-invasion-al-qaeda-saddam-hussein-bush/) by
the administration of then-U.S. President George W Bush, to prevent Iraq
from developing a nuclear weapon, something it had
come [close](https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/iraq-nuclear/) to
achieving in the early 1990s. If Iraq had already acquired a bomb, would
the U.S. have led an invasion of the country? Of course, the fear was
that Saddam Hussein would be more likely than most leaders to use such a
weapon. But it's also likely he would have recognized that deploying it
would have induced states in the region, such as Israel, or outside the
region, such as the United States, to retaliate in a manner that would
have ended his regime.

Of course, even if all states have nuclear weapons, fear of being the
"second strike" state, and hence incurring the brunt of a mutually
devastating nuclear exchange, could drive states to launch first even if
they have defensive intentions. This is why non-proliferation has been a
foundational component of U.S. foreign policy since it first developed a
nuclear weapon in 1945.

Still, it is possible that nuclear proliferation won't end up being a
bad thing. As
I [wrote](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/fears-of-a-nuclear-iran-jcpoa-or-not-might-be-overblown/) previously
**[with respect to Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon, "[It might be
better to let them have it and then learn to live with
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**." While this might sound like a plea to accept
a bad outcome, it's possible that wars between great powers and even
wars by great powers against others are less likely in a world without
nuclear weapons. Though Nobel Peace prizes don't tend to be awarded to
those who encourage nuclear proliferation, **[[it's quite feasible
that]{.mark} Donald [Trump]{.mark} [may]{.mark}, in an unintentional and
ironic way, [make the world more peaceful by pursuing policies that lead
more countries to acquire]{.mark} the [bomb]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Not past tipping points

#### We are not yet past tipping points

Andrei **Ionescu** 4-28-20**25** (PhD in cognitive humanities from the
University of Padua (Italy), and conducted extensive interdisciplinary
research at the intersection of the sciences and the humanities at
Constructor University, the University of Groningen, Cardiff University,
and the University of Bucharest, multiple times published.), "Climate
tipping points: How close are we to irreversible change?", Earth.com,
https://www.earth.com/news/climate-tipping-points-how-close-are-we-to-irreversible-change/

[The [planet is edging]{.mark} far [closer]{.mark} to irreversible
change [than]{.mark} most [policy debate]{.mark}s [acknowledge]{.mark},
according to the most comprehensive probability analysis yet of climate
"tipping points."]{.underline} The research was a collaboration between
the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute and the University
of Hamburg. [The experts have calculated that, [if governments follow
their present course]{.mark}, [there is]{.mark} roughly a [two-in-three
likelihood that]{.mark} at least [one major]{.mark} Earth-system
[component will tip into a]{.mark} radically different and largely
[irreversible state]{.mark}.]{.underline} Tipping points measured in the
study Tipping points are thresholds where small incremental warming
forces a system -- such as an ice sheet, an ocean circulation pattern,
or a vast forest -- into a self-propagating transition. To gauge just
how close humanity is to those thresholds, lead author Jakob Deutloff
and colleagues looked at sixteen well-studied tipping elements. Their
list included collapse of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets,
disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, wholesale
die-off of the Amazon rainforest, abrupt thaw of Arctic permafrost, and
several others ranging from coral reefs to boreal forests. Using the
Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) climate model coupled to a
simplified representation of Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw, the
team ran tens of thousands of Monte-Carlo simulations. These runs
sampled three layers of uncertainty: the planet's sensitivity to
greenhouse gases, the temperature thresholds at which each element could
tip, and the time each system would take to complete its transition. Are
the tipping points avoidable? [The researchers then drove the model with
five standard emissions pathways, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs). The [scenario that best matches today's national
policies]{.mark} -- SSP2-4.5, which delivers about 2.8 °C of warming by
2100 -- [proved alarmingly unsafe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Averaged across
all sixteen tipping elements, the probability of at least one being
triggered reached 62 percent. Nine of the elements exceeded 50 percent
likelihood individually, including the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the
Greenland Ice Sheet and the Amazon rainforest. **[[Under higher-emission
futures]{.mark} such as SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5, [tipping virtually becomes
unavoidable]{.mark} for most elements. [Conversely,]{.mark} [more
aggressive mitigation plans]{.mark} that align [with the Paris
Agreement]{.mark} -- SSP1-2.6 (about 1.8 °C peak warming) and SSP1-1.9
(1.5 °C) -- [cut the average probability to]{.mark} roughly 37 percent
and [14]{.mark} percent, respectively, though they do not eliminate risk
entirely.]{.underline}** Extra push from carbon-cycle feedbacks [The
study also tackled a longstanding concern that emissions released by one
tipping element -- specifically [Amazon dieback or permafrost
thaw]{.mark} --]{.underline} could generate sufficient extra warming to
push others over the edge. By embedding a conceptual carbon-feedback
module inside FaIR, the researchers found that even under current-policy
warming, [additional carbon from those two sources would [raise]{.mark}
global [temperature by]{.mark} a median of only [0.22]{.mark} °C by
2300. That figure is an [order of magnitude smaller than the warming
driven directly by human activity]{.mark} and increases the average
tipping probability by just three percentage points.]{.underline} In
high-emission futures the absolute carbon release is larger, but the
boost to global temperature is proportionally smaller because
anthropogenic emissions dominate. The conclusion: **[[feedbacks]{.mark}
[from these two]{.mark} carbon-rich systems [are not]{.mark}, on their
own, [likely to set off a domino cascade]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Nonetheless, the authors caution that other physical interactions --
such as changes in ocean circulation or cloud cover -- could still
amplify risks in ways not captured by the present model. Global warming:
A question of timing One of the biggest unknowns remains how fast each
tipping element responds once its threshold temperature is crossed. The
team calculated two extremes. In an "instantaneous" view, an element
flips as soon as the global mean temperature passes its threshold. In an
"equilibrium" view, tipping occurs only if temperature remains above
that threshold after the climate stabilizes. For high-emission
scenarios, where warming climbs continuously, the distinction hardly
matters. In mitigation pathways that involve a mid-century overshoot
followed by cooling, however, the assumed reaction speed makes a
dramatic difference: instantaneous triggering can more than double the
probability relative to the equilibrium calculation. Preventing the
climate tipping points ["The [good news from our study is]{.mark} that
the [power to prevent]{.mark} climate tipping points [is still in our
hands]{.mark}," Deutloff said. "By [moving towards]{.mark} a more
sustainable future with [lower emissions]{.mark}, [the risk of]{.mark}
triggering these [tipping points is significantly reduced]{.mark}. And
it appears that breaching tipping points within the Amazon and the
permafrost region should not necessarily trigger others."]{.underline}
Study co-author Tim Lenton warmer that climate tipping points could have
devastating consequences for humanity,. "It is clear that we are
currently on a dangerous trajectory -- with tipping points likely to be
triggered unless we change course rapidly." ["[We need urgent]{.mark}
global action -- including the triggering of '[positive tipping
points']{.mark} in our societies and economies -- to reach a safe and
sustainable future," said Lenton. Rapid transitions are urgently needed
Positive tipping points refer to [self-reinforcing social and
technological shifts]{.mark} -- [such as]{.mark} rapid [adoption of
renewable energy]{.mark}, electric vehicles or new food systems -- that
can drive emissions downward at exponential rates.]{.underline} The
authors argue that deliberately engineering such rapid transitions is
now humanity's best chance of keeping global warming below levels where
probabilities of catastrophic change climb toward certainty.

<https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2025/03/refocusing-cisa-under-trump-a-strategic-approach-to-critical-infrastructure-defense/>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency must refocus its
mission to sharpen its core capabilities and expand its authority,
moving away from bureaucratic distractions such as disinformation
monitoring. **[[CISA's primary mission is to secure]{.mark} federal
[networks]{.mark} and critical infrastructure, [yet]{.mark} [recent

businesses, diluting CISA's effectiveness.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Private sector fills in for CISA

Alexander **Culafi** 20**25**, (Senior News Writer, Dark Reading), "As
CISA Downsizes, Where Can Enterprises Get Support?", Dark reading, April
1, 2025,
https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/roundtable-cisa-downsizes-where-can-enterprises-look-support

[The [comments below]{.mark} were gathered [from]{.mark} Nitin
Natarajan, security adviser, and former [CISA deputy director]{.mark};
Brandon Wales, SentinelOne vice president of cybersecurity strategy and
former CISA [executive director]{.mark}; Austin Berglas, global head of
professional services at BlueVoyant and former [head of cyber,
FBI]{.mark}, New York; Riaz Lakhani, chief information security office
(CISO) at Barracuda; and Jake Williams, vice president of research and
development at Hunter Strategy.]{.underline}

In the wake of CISA downsizing, where should enterprises look for
support? Would it present opportunities for the private sector?

Nitin Natarajan: Over the last several years, we have seen an increase
in efforts across the nation to build capability and in strengthening
our resilience against cyberattacks.

[[Private sector companies have offered tools]{.mark} and services at
reduced or no cost to some critical infrastructure partners. [Academic
institutions have utilized undergraduate and graduate students]{.mark}
to help support their communities in [implementing stronger
cybersecurity practices]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some state governments
have developed teams of individuals to help critical infrastructure
owners and operators, especially small and medium-sized businesses, and
enhance their cybersecurity posture. I suspect we will see more of these
types of programs standing up in the months and years to come.

Additionally, while there are many commercial resources available to
help organizations, some critical infrastructure owners and operators,
especially small and medium-sized public and private sector entities,
are not able to invest in these services, making it harder to build
resilience against a growing threat landscape.

Brandon Wales: [One of **[America\'s strengths is its vibrant private
sector cybersecurity ecosystem]{.mark}**, which has deep talent and
[expertise to help both governments and private industry to protect
themselves]{.mark} against the wide array of malicious actors out there.
**[I expect that ecosystem to fill critical gaps, should they
emerge]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Austin Berglas: The downsizing of CISA and other government agencies has
the potential to weaken the security posture of the United States and
our allies, and expose them to increasing threats of devastating cyber
attacks. Although collaboration and information sharing with private

[The whiteness of this international---both historically and in the
present---has, however, been rendered "conceptually
invisible"]{.underline}13 to international lawyers in part because of
the current conceptualization of race by both mainstream and critical
accounts of the discipline. In order to begin to unwhiten it, [Part I of
this Article re-reads existing historical and theoretical accounts of
the discipline, arguing that aside from the "racial aphasia" 14 that
characterizes the mainstream, critical scholarship is prone to either
overparticularize, or underhistorisize, the role that "race" has and
continues to play]{.underline}. Part II of this Article then reconsiders
the "reinvention" of international law in the late nineteenth century,
arguing that it was only thinkable and possible because of the racial
imaginary---the "White World" or the "White international" ---that its
founders (i.e. the Men of 1873) assumed and reproduced, one that was
based on a particular biological conceptualization of race[. It aims to
show how, paraphrasing W.E.B. Du Bois, the Men of 1873 discovered that
they were white and international, and, by that token, wonderful, at the
same time.15]{.underline}

In Part III, this Article turns to the Black Internationalist fiction of
W.E.B. Du Bois and George Schuyler to show how these scholars not only
[recognized this "White International" as a sociopolitical system of
Global White Supremacy, but they also set out to map its conditions of
making and unmaking through fiction (in Dark Princess \[1928\] and The
Black Internationale: Story of Black Genius Against the World
\[1936--38\], respectively).16 It will end by considering how Black
Internationalist fiction more generally might be read as "alternate
clocks and maps of global racial resistance" and as tools for
unwhitening both the international and the world.17]{.underline}

[RE-THINKING "RACE" AND INTERNATIONAL LAW Within mainstream
international legal scholarship, as with other mainstreams, the subject
of race is often met with "silence and evasion."18 Despite the
acceptance of the role of European colonialism in shaping the field,
race remains largely unspoken about within the centerground of
international law.]{.underline} Although the aforementioned 2019
collection, Concepts for International Law, draws on a diverse
collection of scholars (geographically, theoretically, and
generationally), it contains no entry for race among the sixty-odd
concepts discussed.19 [When the subject of race does make an appearance
within mainstream scholarship (usually as individual racism), a proper
appreciation of international law's longstanding and intimate
association with race]{.underline} (and, in particular, [with Global
White Supremacy as a "multidimensional system of
domination]{.underline}"20[) is evaded through the adoption of an
account of race that is depoliticized, 21 dehistoricized, 22 and
domesticated.]{.underline} 23 [This much is hardly surprising. I want to
suggest, however, that even critical international legal scholarship is
prone to two misreadings which, in effect, minimize the role that race
plays in international law. As such, it is not only necessary to
re-think race in international law (i.e. to place race back on the
research agenda), but to rethink "race" generally (i.e. to
re-conceptualize how we understand "race" and its
articulations).24]{.underline}

[The first misreading of the role that race plays in international law
is one that overparticularizes it, both empirically and conceptually,
thereby reducing it to the individual prejudices (or problematic
theories) of one or two aberrant international lawyers, usually of the
past (such as James Lorimer).25]{.underline} This move to both
particularize and exceptionalize Lorimer's racism---and by doing so
exculpate international law historically and theoretically---is evident
in a European Journal of International Law symposium titled "Through a
Glass, Darkly: Reflections on James Lorimer's International Law."26 In
his contribution to the issue, Martti Koskenniemi set out to illustrate
"the idiosyncratic character of James Lorimer's . . . conception of
international law," which set him apart from his liberal contemporaries
and the traditions that preceded him and emanated "\[i\]n various ways .
. . from his hierarchical and deeply racist view of human
communities."27 [According to Koskenniemi, Lorimer's racist and elitist
views were to be distinguished---perhaps radically---from what "most of
his \[liberal\] contemporaries were thinking---or at least what they
were saying---about the nature and future of international
law."]{.underline}

[The claim that Lorimer's racist views were not widely shared is
difficult to sustain, even if one takes a narrow (liberal) definition of
racism as being the speech, thought and actions of aberrant
individuals.28]{.underline} Such views were arguably so widely shared
amongst Lorimer's contemporaries at the time that they did not need to
be expressed. In his study on how the Western racial imagination evolved
in international relations, Frank Füredi notes that "until the late
1930s, racial thinking was an accepted part of the intellectual climate"
and the "principle of Western racial superiority \[that\] guided the
informal and formal actions of white diplomats and politicians" was
"part of the self-knowledge of the Anglo-American political elites and .
. . passed for common sense."29 [If this holds true for international
lawyers, then racist views were not part of what Lorimer's
contemporaries were saying about "the nature and future of international
law" because such views went without saying.]{.underline}

ABSTRACT

The role that resource extraction, particularly mining and oil palm
plantation, has played in enabling a form of racism in West Papua is
presented. [[The history of mining projects]{.mark} in West Papua, and
how this has displaced indigenous populations, is covered.]{.underline}
This development of mining reserves and oil palm plantations at the
expense and the destruction of indigenous life is discussed. [This
process [has relied on **a dehumanisation of indigenous
people**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [an ignorance of their agency]{.mark} in
determining their own needs. The effects of [resource
extraction]{.mark}, on cultural sustainability, [and its supplantation
with]{.mark} **[industrial colonialism is presented as a form of
racism]{.mark}**; concepts of 'industrial racism' and 'industrial
colonisation' are introduced within this context. It is demonstrated
that this racism has been both explicitly and implicitly supported by
Western and Global South governments, highlighting the need for a voice
for indigenous groups in self-determination.]{.underline} The more
recent reparations to help achieve self-determination, even in this
modern context of understanding, are shown to have a colonial approach.
The view that matters have improved, through various awards for
sustainability, is presented and critiqued, demonstrating the conflict
between that view and that of the indigenous within a colonial power
structure.

Introduction

Indigenous West Papuans, or more specifically Melanesians, have been
subjected to horrendous acts of racism over a 50-year period since the
failed attempts at independence and self-determination in 1969.Footnote1
[[Concurrent with this racism has been an **exploitation of
minerals**]{.mark}, forestry and fisheries in the region by foreign
'investors' aided and supported militarily by Indonesian governments.
Historically, the region of West Papua, and West Papuans themselves had
been insignificant in status in many ways to both the Dutch colonisers
pre-1969 and to their near neighbours Indonesia.]{.underline} The
insignificance of the land itself changed dramatically when it was
realised that great wealth could be potentially gained from access to
plentiful natural resources, specifically the large metal and mineral
deposits, but also latterly the planting of oil palm in the region and
subsequent deforestation. To justify the exploitation of these natural
resources, racism against West Papuans, or more specifically indigenous
groups thereof, has been a necessary tool in the process. [What began
then was **an effective dehumanisation of indigenous populations** to
achieve the industrial aims of a colonising occupier. Equally though,
resource extraction activities more broadly have themselves been an
active tool of racism in dehumanising the indigenous
populations.]{.underline} This complex interaction between the drivers
and needs of resource extraction, the environment, and the indigenous
has a power structure, with unequal balances of that power based on
differing definitions of what human existence is. [[This interaction
relies on a positioning of **the 'industrial coloniser'**, and the way
in which these human rights abuses are viewed by them,]{.mark} but also
in the way that indigenous groups have responded to them. The
relationship between the coloniser and the colonised is not clear and is
nuanced in terms of the specific location of indigenous people proximal
to the location of resource extraction but has an effect more widely on
the region. Despite an increasing recognition, by the colonising
industrial companies, of a need to take into consideration the human
rights of indigenous populations[, it is the contention of this article
that colonial relationships are effectively retained, and while evolving
enable new forms of **systemic racism to be
supported.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since 2020, harassment of civilian vessels has involved a range of
actions.43 These include China's 2023 deployment of what it labeled an
inspection flotilla in the Taiwan Strait. The flotilla had a mandate to
inspect all commercial shipping going through the strait on both sides
of the median line. In the end, it did not conduct these inspections.
But had it done so, it would have caused considerable disruption and
delays to commercial shipping in the Taiwan Strait, through which some
240 merchant ships sail on an average day.[44 Merchant [ships sail
through the strait on the condition that the median line will be
respected and that they won't be subjected to unwarranted

**Note: LOSC is the Law of the Sea convention.**

[[Article 17 of the losc]{.mark} [establishes]{.mark} **[the right of
'innocent passage]{.mark}'**]{.underline} for all vessels traversing the
territorial waters of coastal States. An 'innocent passage' is defined
as a passage that does not jeopardise the 'peace, good order, or
security of the coastal State'.38 However, a precise definition for the
phrase 'peace, good order, or security' does not exist. Coastal States
may assert that the passage of [[fnpps]{.mark} [carrying]{.mark} spent
or fresh [nuclear fuel]{.mark}, [with the potential to affect
the]{.mark} marine environment and [ecosystems]{.mark} [through
potential radioactive discharge]{.mark} or nuclear leakage, **[cannot be
considered innocent]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Similarly, a neighbouring
State can also lay claims of potential transboundary effects against a
coastal State that deploys fnpp in its territorial waters. [Some critics
have highlighted that the 'non-self-propelled' nature of fnpps, thus
requiring towage, presents additional environmental risks, especially in
adverse weather conditions, including threats of terrorist attacks,
maritime accidents, severe mechanical failures, explosions, or nuclear
leaks during fnpp transportation.39]{.underline} Nonetheless, several
losc provisions indicate that a coastal State cannot unreasonably deny a
vessel its right of innocent passage. For example, Article 19(2)
outlines factors considered prejudicial to 'peace, good order, or
security'. [However, controversy arises with Article 19(2)(h), allowing
a coastal State to deny a vessel innocent passage due to 'wilful and
serious pollution'.]{.underline} Determining 'serious' pollution is
problematic, particularly given the often invisible and long-lasting
effects of radioactive pollution. Also, what constitutes 'wilful'
pollution presents challenges, as it usually refers to motivation.
Historically, radioactive releases have mostly been accidental and
hardly 'wilful'. According to Roscini, 'wilfulness' refers not to the
consequence of the conduct but to the conduct itself.40 [This suggests
that [fnpp]{.mark} [passage]{.mark} should not be hampered solely based
on potential environmental impacts but on actual **[harm caused by their
operations]{.mark}.** This poses a dilemma regarding the principle
mandating precautionary measures to protect the marine environment,
which is binding on all States under Part xii of the losc.41 The losc
limits the powers that a coastal State exercises over its territorial
waters by providing that coastal States can only suspend 'temporarily'
and not completely prevent the innocent passage of a vessel.
Furthermore, the suspension of such passage would only take place where
there is a security threat, and in those circumstances, such suspension
must be duly published.]{.underline}42 Articles 22 and 23 explicitly
address vessels transporting nuclear material, which makes those
provisions the most applicable in this context. Article 23 reaffirms the
principle of innocent passage for vessels navigating through the
territorial sea and carrying nuclear materials and other hazardous
substances. The only requirement for such passage is that the ship has
appropriate 'documents' and 'observe special precautionary measures
established for such ships by international agreements'. There is no
reference to any specific 'special precautionary measures' and
'international agreements' in that provision. [However, it is inferred
that these agreements would encompass regulations set forth by
international regulatory bodies such as imo and the iaea. [Article
22]{.mark} [allows coastal States to designate specific sea lanes for
nuclear-powered vessels]{.mark} [and those carrying hazardous
substances, including fnpps and the towing of fnpps, **which raises
concerns about safety standards**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given that fnpps
are towed by other vessels, increasing the risk of accidents, should
safety standards for fnpps be distinct and more stringent compared to
those for selfpropelled vessels?
