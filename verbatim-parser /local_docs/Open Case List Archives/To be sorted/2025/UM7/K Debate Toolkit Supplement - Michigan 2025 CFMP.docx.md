#### Capitalism is [dying]{.underline}, the only question is whether it will be replaced by [radical democracy]{.underline} or [plutocratic fascism]{.underline}. Voting aff is a practice of [counter-solidarity]{.underline} that helps elites [maintain power]{.underline}. The alternative is [transformative anti-capitalist solidarity]{.underline} as a [means]{.underline} and an [end]{.underline}---that's the only way to avert [extinction]{.underline} and [global immiseration]{.underline}.

The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*, Introduction,
pp. 11-20, dml)

[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} a handful of
[[billionaires]{.underline}]{.mark} can afford to [take]{.underline}
vanity [flights to **space** and]{.underline} pay top dollar for
well-stocked bunkers to [[ride out **climate
catastrophes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of
people [[live]{.mark} in poverty [on a **collapsing
planet**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [where [**forest fires** rage
and]{.mark}]{.underline} up to one million different [[species]{.mark}
are [on the verge of **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[7\] Sensing
opportunity, [those in power have responded to]{.underline} our era's
[calamities by]{.underline} further exploiting regular people's
vulnerabilities, [capitalizing on confusion and resentment]{.underline},
[and scapegoating their victims in order to **deflect blame away** from
themselves]{.underline}. The result is a resurgent global right wing,
beholden to a corporate elite, steeped in misinformation, and unabashed
in their bigotry, with lines of antagonism sharpening around questions
of race, religion, immigration status, gender, sexuality, and more---a
right wing willing, for example, to spend over \$50 million in 2022 on
political advertisements attacking LGBTQ+ people, particularly trans
children, in order to stir up hate and votes, and to performatively bus
immigrants from red states to blue ones, with no concern for their
well-being. \[8\]

Meanwhile, [those who claim to represent the]{.underline} political
[center]{.underline} distinguish themselves by not being as extreme as
this right-wing opposition, but they too [use division in more subtle
ways]{.underline}. For example, [they pursue]{.underline} market-based
solutions that deepen pre-existing social inequities, advocate for
targeted or means-tested government policies that deem some people
"worthy" and others "unworthy" of public assistance, and castigate
activists for being unreasonable when they argue that safe space be made
for members of marginalized groups.\[9\] Whipped along by [a strategy of
**divide** and **conquer**]{.underline}, liberal democracies [the
**world**]{.underline} over [appear to be perpetually teetering on the
edge of social and political **disaster**]{.underline}, with hard-won
social progress being systematically undone.

The premise of this book is simple: [shifting away from this tragic
course requires the conscious cultivation of
**[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an understudied concept that must
be reclaimed from the history of social and political thought.
Fundamentally, we understand solidarity as [the recognition of our
**inherent interconnectedness**]{.underline}, an attempt to build bonds
of commonality across our differences. [It [is]{.mark} an **ethos** and
**spur to action** rooted in the [acknowledgment that our lives are
intertwined]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Intertwined]{.underline}, however,
[does [not]{.mark} mean]{.underline}
**[[indistinguishable]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[solidarity depends
on]{.underline} difference, on [recognizing that we are not all exactly
alike but]{.underline} that [we can still **come together** and take
**collective action**]{.underline}. [It is not unity [or
sameness]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} a way of [**connecting**
with others]{.mark}]{.underline}: [[forging **new
communities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [developing **[shared
visions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and building **power**]{.mark} to push
for social change]{.underline}.

Our actions, policies, and institutions are built on a foundation of
concepts and ideas that too often go overlooked in everyday discourse
and yet have immense influence over our public and private lives.
Solidarity, we believe, is a concept as fundamental to the possibility
of democracy as its sisters, liberty and justice; and it is ever more
relevant as we fight to make our democracy more egalitarian,
sustainable, and pluralistic. But to say that solidarity is the cure to
what ails us is the easy part. The challenge is [acting on this basic
insight and imbuing our social dynamics with a sense of
fellow-feeling]{.underline}. It [is **challenging**]{.underline}, in
part, [because]{.underline} we lack accessible, practical wisdom about
solidarity as a political tradition. Nowhere is this truer than in the
United States, where American [culture emphasizes **individualism** and
**personal freedom**]{.underline} above all. Beyond certain left-
leaning circles where people sign their emails "in solidarity," the
principle rarely appears in mainstream culture or contemporary political
discourse.

And yet, despite being undervalued, solidarity has indelibly shaped the
modern world. In the chapters ahead, we emphasize the role of
[[solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark} in a particular historical and
intellectual tradition that [[stretches back to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
mid- nineteenth century and reaches around the globe, continuing through
post--Civil War **[[Reconstruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[labor
movements]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the creation of [the **welfare
state**]{.underline} in Europe and [the **New Deal**]{.underline} in the
United States, **[[postcolonial movements]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
independence, [and into the present day]{.underline}---movements that
have all, in various ways, fought to expand the bounds of democracy. As
this history shows, [solidarity requires **intentional
cultivation**]{.underline}; it is not a spontaneous phenomenon. This has
only been underscored by recent events, including the Covid-19
pandemic---a phenomenon that exposed our interdependence and
vulnerabilities, but that resulted in more distrust and division,
including anti-vaccination protests and anti-Asian violence. In the
words of historian Jack Hayward, today we live amid the "squalid
consequences of liberty without solidarity," born of the very political
bloc Phillips envisioned and animated by what he described as a spirit
of "white anger and counter-solidarity."\[10\]

Historically, the question of solidarity has been raised at times of
massive changes in society, a motif we continue here. Contemporary
conceptions of solidarity first began to take form amid the Industrial
Revolution and the emergence of modern capitalism, and in the wake of
the democratic revolutions of the eighteenth century. As kings were
deposed and the Church's role as a locus of moral authority waned,
philosophers and citizens wondered how society could hang together
without a monarch or god. What could bind people in a modern,
pluralistic, secular age? As we enter a new period of instability and
change, we must ask similar questions today. What can enable us to come
together despite entrenched social divisions and the immense power of
self-interested elites so we can address the crises that threaten us?
And more terrifyingly: What happens if we cannot?

Unfortunately, for people seeking to foster solidarity, there are few
forums or resources to turn to for advice. As we discuss, tremendous
amounts of money and energy have been directed toward suppressing
solidarity and attacking the institutions that incubate it, particularly
labor unions. There is also a notable lack of scholarly attention to the
concept of solidarity. As we began our research into solidarity's
historical evolution, we were struck by the scarcity of historical and
theoretical writing on the subject. In comparison to the countless
treatises on the evolution and significance of justice, liberty,
equality, and democracy that line library shelves and make up the canon
of Western political thought, there are remarkably few studies of
solidarity. In the words of German philosopher Kurt Bayertz, "Solidarity
as a phenomenon lies like an erratic block in the midst of the moral
landscape of our Modern Age. It is familiar in an everyday sense, and
yet it has remained a foreign body...Until now, the geologists familiar
with this landscape---Modern Age moral philosophers---have taken it for
granted, have circumnavigated it."\[11\] We hope this book begins to
make the concept clearer and more approachable, so that solidarity does
not just appear fitfully in moments of struggle but can be cultivated
consciously and used strategically. It is, we believe, our most
important tool.

While there are many insightful histories and accounts of specific
campaigns and movements, as well as helpful guides to the art of
organizing, few attempt a more holistic assessment or sustained
reflection on the concept of solidarity itself. We suspect this lack
stems, at least in part, from the fact that solidarity is both a theory
and a practice, or what radical educator Paulo Freire called praxis, the
"reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it."\[12\]
That is, [solidarity is [not only]{.mark}]{.underline} a thought or a
feeling, [[a **theory** or a **principle**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[it
is]{.mark} also [something you **do**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and it
must involve **others**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In various ways,
solidarity is related to, but distinct from, both community and
identity. Inasmuch as it is something experienced, it is not a given but
must be generated; made, not found. Unlike the concepts of freedom and
equality, [solidarity does not lend itself to **tidy philosophical
formulations**]{.underline}; unlike democracy, [you cannot reduce it to
a set of **clearly defined procedures**]{.underline}; unlike justice,
solidarity is not objective and universal but is always invested in
specific people and outcomes. [Implying **positive obligations** to
act]{.underline}, [solidarity is]{.underline} untidy, particular,
interested, engaged. These qualities make solidarity a
**[difficult]{.underline}** subject [for people who prefer their
politics **more abstract** and **less messy**]{.underline}, but they are
precisely why we find the concept so interesting and vital.

No wonder, then, that even those who would like to see more solidarity
in the world often know little about the concept's origins or evolution.
Traditionally, the term's most common association is with the labor
movement, which adopted "solidarity" as a battle cry during the
Industrial Revolution. This was mainly due to the perseverance of a
brush-maker named Johann Philipp Becker, whom the historian Sven-Eric
Liedman describes as an "ardent champion of the word solidarity."\[13\]
An associate of Karl Marx, Becker argued that solidarity was less about
morality than materiality; its basis was the common exploitation of
workers around the world, and its practice would enable workers to build
the power required to wrest concessions from the wealthy. Though Becker
prevailed in promoting the word's usage, [[Marx]{.mark} and
his]{.underline} most prominent [followers [never]{.mark} truly [dealt
with]{.mark} the fact that [solidarity]{.mark} is something that [needs
to be **constructed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, assuming that workers would
inevitably come together to mobilize due to their shared economic
circumstances. This belief that economic class made solidarity a given
was evidenced by Friedrich Engels's [insistence that]{.underline} "[the
simple **feeling** of solidarity]{.underline}, based on an insight into
the sameness of the class position, [is sufficient]{.underline} in order
to create amongst all of the laborers of all countries and languages one
large and cohesive proletariat party."\[14\] Confidence in a prophecy
that would not come to pass [consigned the word to the realm of
**rhetoric**]{.underline}---a term for union meetings, propaganda, and
song, rather than a robust principle that could guide practice and help
usher in a truly revolutionary era.

Today, [we are in the midst of a **massive political
realignment**]{.underline} in American politics. Both major parties are
sites of profound internal conflicts and power struggles: Democrats are
torn between a growing progressive flank pushing to redistribute wealth,
tackle climate change, and further racial and gender justice and a
corporate wing clinging to the increasingly unequal and failing status
quo; Republicans are being forced to reconcile their outdated
libertarian conservatism with a rabid, conspiracy-driven,
white-supremacist fascism. Meanwhile, [[the neoliberal]{.mark} economic
[paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline} that both parties have adhered to for
decades, which conscripts the state into a project of protecting
markets, restricting democracy, and sabotaging solidarity, [[appears
**exhausted**]{.underline}]{.mark} after fifty years of dominance, [[but
it is **unclear** what will supersede it]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
whether]{.mark} what comes [next will be **better** or **worse**]{.mark}
than our current condition]{.underline}.\[15\] We sit at a moment of
significant opportunity and threat. To move forward, we must grapple
with the questions of how to build solidarity and with whom.

Later in his life, Kevin Phillips turned on the Republican Party and
wrote multiple books lamenting the deleterious impact of rising economic
inequality, but he did not examine his own role as a tactician for the
market forces he claimed to abhor, nor did he recognize the need to
repair the solidarity he had worked to fray in order to restrain
them.\[16\] And so that project falls to us. [Successfully [resisting
plutocratic efforts]{.mark} to split people apart]{.underline} in order
to dominate public life [[requires]{.mark} creating [**new coalitions**
that have the power to **influence our laws** and
**institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and developing the **stamina**
to **sustain** these]{.mark} new political forms]{.underline}. [By
[conceiving]{.mark} of [ourselves as **intrinsically bound**]{.mark} in
relationships of mutuality and care]{.underline} that span generations,
[we [can understand our obligation to provide]{.mark} a secure and
dignified life to others [while also recognizing that we are entitled to
such]{.mark} an existence ourselves]{.underline}.

Unlike principles such as justice and liberty, solidarity did not become
a popular political concept until the mid-nineteenth century, shortly
before it became the labor movement's motto.\[17\] But in tracing its
ancestry back further, solidarity's roots extend to ancient Rome, where
the idea represented a kind of financial and legal arrangement. The term
originally comes from the legal notion of "obligatio in solidum," a debt
held in common by multiple debtors, each on the hook for each
other.\[18\] It appears in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French
texts as a term of juridical and commercial application, until it is
more fully established in Napoleon's Code Civil of 1804, in a section
titled Des Obligations Solidaires.\[19\] Throughout the nineteenth
century, numerous legal scholars examined the relationship between Roman
and French law in this regard, but it was during the Industrial
Revolution that the modern usage of solidarity came into being. Workers,
socialists, and a "solidarist" political movement in France adopted the
concept to guide them through dramatic social upheavals. [Solidarity
became a **rallying cry** for the exploited and a way for more
privileged reformers to think about how to solve the problems created by
unfettered capitalism]{.underline}.

The nineteenth-century thinkers who began seriously contemplating and
writing about the idea of solidarity often used the image of the human
body, which is composed of all kinds of different parts---arms, legs,
eyes, knees, lungs, and spleen---working together to function as a
whole.\[20\] They were responding to the rise of a new economy, the
industrial division of labor, and mass migration from rural farms to
cities, which generated both misery and possibility. As society became
more urbanized and complex, early theorists of solidarity optimistically
hoped that people would recognize their fates as linked and make
mutualism a central value of the emerging social order.
[Solidarity]{.underline}, they surmised, [was what could **keep a world
in flux from breaking apart**]{.underline}. Their arguments played an
important role in creating what is known today as the welfare state,
which aims to ensure that its citizens live with a basic level of
dignity.\[21\]

Thus, in its most basic sense solidarity suggests a kind of stability.
Etymologically solidarity relates to the word solid, from the Latin
solidus, meaning "of a strong, firm, or substantial nature or
quality."\[22\] For Émile Durkheim and later sociologists, it is a
measure of group cohesion.\[23\] Generally speaking, solidarity is that
which binds a group---that visceral feeling of connection and mutuality
that sharing a hometown, alma mater, or favorite sports team can
produce.

Importantly, though, this means that [solidarity is not always a
**positive force** or a driver of progress and change]{.underline}:
these bonds can be neutral, reactionary, or transformative, depending on
the community and context. As French legal theorist Alain Supiot
explains, "The broader meaning of solidarity in fact refers to that
which solidifies a human group, without making any assumptions as to the
nature and composition of the glue binding the members of this group
together."\[24\] Solidarity creates passionate in-group bonds, and these
can justify violent othering, as evidenced by the exclusionary
solidarity of white supremacists, ruling elites, and jingoistic
nationalists. [In its **reactionary** form]{.underline}, [it is the easy
draw of **like-to-like**]{.underline}, and [often aggressive in its
rejection of that which is different]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
what Kevin Phillips called "**[counter-solidarity]{.underline}**," and
what he sought to foster in order to build a Republican majority to
obstruct the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. And it is what
continues to fuel the right- wing forces that surge around the world
today.

[In contrast]{.underline}, [we are interested in]{.underline} what we
call "**[[transformative solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**"---[the kind
that propelled]{.underline} the fight for civil rights along with other
[movements that have sought to expand the circle of inclusion while also
**altering society's very character**]{.underline}. Unless we indicate
otherwise, [this is]{.underline} what we mean when we use the word
solidarity: [the force that [achieved **universal
suffrage**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [won [the **eight-hour
workday**]{.mark} as well as the weekend]{.underline}, [made
[the]{.mark} modern **[welfare state]{.mark}** viable]{.underline},
[[defeated **Jim Crow**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[enshrined **disability
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and much more]{.underline}. [Solidarity
has stretched across the globe [linking
**abolitionists**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the nineteenth century,
[**national [independence]{.mark}** [movements]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the twentieth, [[and]{.mark} activists agitating for the [cancellation
of]{.mark} **sovereign [debt]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the twenty-first;
[[it]{.mark} is the tie that [binds **women**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[queer]{.underline}**, [and **trans people**]{.underline}, [as well as
**workers** and **debtors**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [fighting for equality
and freedom today]{.underline}. [Transformative solidarity is both a
**means** and an **end**]{.underline}, [the **process** of struggling
together and a way of **describing** a kind of society that is more just
and mutualistic]{.underline}.\[25\]

[[Where]{.underline}]{.mark} reactionary or [[**counter-solidarity**
emphasizes]{.mark} **given [identities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (usually
racial, religious, class-based, or national identities) [[and aims to
benefit a **small group**]{.underline}]{.mark} by excluding those who
are different, [[transformative solidarity aspires to]{.mark} create
systems that [benefit **everyone**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Transformative
solidarity points us toward the fundamental fellowship of humankind,
connecting us with others despite apparent differences. In this sense,
[transformative solidarity **bonds** but also **bridges**]{.underline}.
Both reactionary and transformative solidarity have indelibly shaped the
world we live in today. But it is the constructive power of
transformative solidarity, and its role [as a **bulwark** against
reactionary strategies of divide and conquer]{.underline}, that
primarily concerns us here.

Our conception of [transformative solidarity also diverges from the
[many **semblances**]{.mark} of solidarity that]{.underline} are
commonplace today yet, in our estimation, [**[fall short]{.mark}** of
the real thing]{.underline}. [[Appeals to
benevolence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [altruism]{.underline},
[[deference]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or allyship]{.underline}]{.mark} are
widespread, and invite us to be empathetic and kind; but they all
[[place the onus on **individual action** rather than]{.mark} larger
**[collective engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} on
[harness]{.mark}ing [**pity** or **guilt**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} [a sense of **[shared
responsibility]{.mark}** or **shared fate**]{.underline}. \[26\]
Similarly, under the virtuous-sounding guises of charity and
philanthropy, the rich and powerful can bestow kindness from on high,
without feeling implicated in the systems that produce poverty,
oppression, and environmental degradation in the first place---the very
systems that also produce their own wealth and power. [Corporations have
learned to play this game expertly]{.underline}, as was the case in
2020, when McDonald's ran an online advertisement claiming to stand with
"victims of systemic oppression" while paying poverty wages, and JP
Morgan, Bank of America, and other companies pledged tens of billions of
dollars to racial equity ---only to allocate the funds as loans and
investments that allowed them to continue to generate profits along with
good press.\[27\] Whether well-intentioned or cynical, [[these]{.mark}
semblances of solidarity [are]{.mark} **woefully [inadequate]{.mark}**
[to the task of]{.mark} transformative [collective
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and sometimes
**antithetical**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to it]{.underline}. [Overcoming
looming threats]{.underline}, [from structural racism to climate
change]{.underline}, [will take more than **self-congratulatory
posturing**]{.underline}. [A just and thriving society requires that its
members **make sacrifices** for one another]{.underline}.

[In contrast to the hierarchical tendencies of allyship]{.underline},
altruism, charity, and philanthropy, [transformative solidarity is
grounded in **equality** and **reciprocity**]{.underline}. Where
[semblances of solidarity too often **give cover** to unjust systems and
the powerful who benefit]{.underline} from them, [transformative
solidarity aims to **upend** oppressive structures]{.underline}. It does
so [by]{.underline} emphasizing commonalities while simultaneously
prioritizing the voice and agency of those who are too often silenced
and sidelined. Solidarity, in this transformative register, involves
[taking strategic risks **together**]{.underline}, [not offering
prescriptions from on high or speaking on behalf of others]{.underline}.
W. E. B. Du Bois captured it precisely when he wrote that "a
consciousness of the humanity of all men, of the sacred unity in all the
diversity, is not merely to lay down a pious postulate, but it is the
active and animate heart- to-heart knowledge of your neighbors, high and
low, black and white, employer and employed..."\[28\]

[Transformative solidarity [involves **expanding** one's sense of
self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[it creates new communities across
social distinctions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [class divides]{.underline},
[and militarized borders]{.underline}. [It names the actions of
exploited and marginalized groups as they come together to build
power]{.underline}, [but it also involves people who are not themselves
the direct targets of oppression]{.underline}, [who choose to join the
struggle for justice nevertheless]{.underline}. [Examples]{.underline}
of this latter group **[abound]{.underline}**. [[Think
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[white
abolitionists]{.underline}]{.mark}** who risked their lives and
reputations to oppose slavery, [including the insurgent **John Brown**
and the sisters]{.underline} Sarah and Angelina
**[Grimké]{.underline}**, who rebelled against their plantation-owning
father, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} Friedrich
**[[Engels]{.underline}]{.mark}**, scion of an industrial family, using
his wealth to fund Marx's activities and support working-class
agitation. [Since the dawn of the **AIDS** epidemic]{.underline},
[[citizens]{.mark} of rich countries have been [organizing
against]{.mark} the **[pharma]{.mark}ceutical industry** to ensure
residents of poor countries can access lifesaving
medicines]{.underline}, [while U.S. **[health-care providers]{.mark}**
are now busy [**defying abortion bans** and **anti-trans laws**]{.mark}
to provide for those in need of their services]{.underline}. Or
[consider the networks of [activists who assist
**migrants**]{.mark}]{.underline} making the hazardous trek across the
American desert or the Mediterranean Sea, [[or]{.mark} who offer
[support]{.mark} to individuals who are or were
**[incarcerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It is not **altruism** or **compassion** that inspires people to
act]{.underline} in these cases, [but the recognition that one's own
liberation is **intimately bound** with the liberation of
others]{.underline}. As Eugene Debs famously put it in 1918, "While
there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal
element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not
free."\[29\] Writing a century later, Derecka Purnell, a young lawyer
and author who was part of the Ferguson, Missouri, uprising, echoed his
sentiment, calling on white people to join the movement against police
brutality as full participants acting in solidarity: "I wanted them to
know that racial violence was bad for them, too. An ally sympathizes. I
wanted less sympathy, and more commitment, risk, and sacrifice to
eradicate white supremacy."\[30\]

[Over the last decade]{.underline}, [social [movements erupted **around
the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [forging
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark} [across lines of race]{.underline},
[gender]{.underline}, [sexuality]{.underline}, [class]{.underline},
faith, [[and]{.mark} nationality]{.underline}. In 2011, Occupy Wall
Street put inequality at the center of the American political debate---a
topic long ignored by mainstream media and public officials. By offering
a new expansive definition of "us" and "them," the 99 percent versus the
1 percent, [**Occupy** helped open the floodgates for an activist
renaissance]{.underline}. **[B]{.underline}**lack
**[L]{.underline}**ives **[M]{.underline}**atter, [**Standing Rock** and
related climate protests]{.underline}, [and **#MeToo**]{.underline} all
challenged what once passed for commonsense. And they [[won **concrete
victories**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}]{.mark} [local
[policing reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [strengthened [environmental
protections]{.mark} and investment]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
heightened [attention to sexual harassment]{.mark}]{.underline} ([nearly
three hundred #MeToo-related bills passed at the state
level]{.underline} between 2017 and 2021).\[31\] [The [reviving labor
movement and increasing prominence of]{.mark} democratic
[socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the
[success]{.underline} of socialists [at the ballot box]{.underline},
[[signal]{.mark} a **deep [dissatisfaction]{.mark}** with the status quo
[and a **growing willingness** among regular people to]{.mark} do the
difficult work that it will take to **[shift the balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} in our winners-take-all society.\[32\]

Predictably, these popular challenges to business as usual have inspired
fierce resistance from the Right, supercharging attempts to obstruct and
derail progressive momentum. Furthermore, [grassroots [movements are
often **internally fraught**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with individuals and
groups who should be in coalition [working in **separate silos**
or]{.mark}]{.underline}, worse still, [[acting as **rival
factions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It can be tempting to fight those who
are **most proximate**]{.underline}, [and wage wars of **small
differences**]{.underline}]{.mark}, when a cause or goal feels large and
daunting---a temptation that only intensifies in periods when the
backlash gathers strength and forward motion stalls. And because a lack
of formal political power means activists' main tool is disruption in
the public square, they are easily marginalized and criticized as naïve,
immature, annoying, and unreasonable. [The [opposition's determination
to **weaponize**]{.mark} a movement's [fault lines and
**amplify**]{.mark} any [mistakes]{.mark} in order [to **push would-be
allies apart**]{.mark} only [makes]{.mark} maintaining
[solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline} through the difficult times [even [more
**essential**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Real organizing is a kind of alchemy. It's a process that turns
alienation into connection, despair into dedication, and oppression into
strength. [When solidarity generates and channels the]{.underline} three

[This solidaristic spirit has been conjured **countless
times**]{.underline}, [transforming participants and society in ways
**great** and **small**]{.underline}. [It was on display

**[B]{.underline}**allistic **[M]{.underline}**issile System, which
would have been the world's largest nuclear weapons facility (the
contentious coalition's motto during their organizing meetings was
"Leave your guns at the door," which they meant both figuratively and
literally), [and in **1984** when striking British miners found support
from gay and lesbian activists]{.underline}, [who were also under attack
from the Thatcher government]{.underline}.\[43\] [It was visible in
**2014** when Palestinian activists advised]{.underline}
**[B]{.underline}**lack **[L]{.underline}**ives
**[M]{.underline}**atters [protesters in **Ferguson**]{.underline},
Missouri, on how to cope with state violence ("Always make sure to run
against the wind / to keep calm when you're teargassed, the pain will
pass, don't rub your eyes! #Ferguson Solidarity") [and]{.underline}
appeared [again in **2020** when unionized transit workers in **New
York** and **Minneapolis** refused to allow cops to commandeer public
buses to transport people arrested protesting police
brutality]{.underline} to local precincts. [It materialized in **2021**
when farmers across **India** mobilized a 250-million-person general
strike]{.underline} against livelihood-destroying legislation, [and in
**2022** in **Iran** when men joined the massive pro-democracy protests
women started]{.underline} after the death of twenty-two-year-old Mahsa
Amini at the hands of the "morality police."

[**Again** and **again**]{.underline}, [people build solidarity and
leave the world a better place]{.underline}, [and yet we still struggle
to tell these inherently collective stories]{.underline}. [Too often the
tale of **Us** gets whittled down into a tale of an
**I**]{.underline}---a story about a visionary liberator or savior who
changed the world. We learn about and celebrate incredible
people---think Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Harvey Milk, and so on--- but
hear comparatively little about the organizing communities that shaped
and supported them, or the collectivities that they tried to build to
carry social change work forward. Our simplifying, celebrity-obsessed
[culture **mythologizes** and **distorts** the legacies of talented
organizers and historical figures while also amplifying]{.underline} a
handful of contemporary mediagenic [activists]{.underline}---the latter
too often [possessing a knack for]{.underline} social media and
**[self-promotion]{.underline}**, [but **lacking** a commitment to an
**organized base** they are accountable to and work in tandem
with]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} emphasis on lone heroes [is a kind
of **flip side** to our fixation on increasing numbers for their **own
sake**]{.underline}, [or on **bigger** protests rather than **better**
ones]{.underline}. An unhelpful binary emerges as a result: social
movements are imagined to consist of charismatic individuals on the one
side and nameless masses on the other.

But real organizing is something else entirely. In reality, [**every
successful effort to challenge the status quo** has required a
**multitude** of people playing a **wide range** of roles]{.underline}.
[Allowing for this diversity is one way to grow both **numbers** and
**meaningful organization**]{.underline}---[by making space for people
to bring their **whole selves**]{.underline}, [plug in **where** and
**how** they can]{.underline}, [and learn new **skills** and discover
new **capacities**]{.underline}, [while also offering them opportunities
to become more **invested** and **engaged**]{.underline}.

To unleash the power in numbers, [our goal must always be to **bring
more people** into the fold and to **truly empower** them]{.underline},
[which means enabling them to harness their own creativity and
conviction in coordination with others]{.underline}. **[Ella
Baker]{.underline}**, [who helped build many of the most important
organizations of the civil rights movement]{.underline}, [including
the]{.underline} Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or
**[SNCC]{.underline}** (a group we'll discuss more in the next chapter),
called this approach "group-centered leadership." Considered by many to
be the most gifted organizer of the twentieth century, Baker
[believed]{.underline} leadership should be shared and accountable, and
she practiced this ethos as much as she preached it, influencing many
important activists over the course of her remarkable life, including
Rosa Parks. "You didn't see me on television, you didn't see news
stories about me," Baker said of her unique approach. "The kind of role
that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of
which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong
[people]{.underline} don't need strong leaders." What they
[needed]{.underline}, instead, was [to be]{.underline} "[**bound
together** by a concept that benefited the **larger number** of
individuals and provided an opportunity for them to **grow** into being
responsible for carrying out a program]{.underline}."\[44\] This is as
good an understanding of solidarity as any.

Baker's group-centered approach is strategic for a variety of reasons,
as she rightly recognized. [It is not about **negating** leadership or
expertise]{.underline}, [but about imparting skills and nurturing
people's capacities so they can **lead themselves**]{.underline}.
[Movement participants are **more likely** to be personally transformed
when they are treated as agents and individuals rather than as **cogs**
in a machine or bodies to be **mobilized on
command**]{.underline}---[and this process of
**subjective**]{.underline}, [**personal** transformation **goes hand in
hand** with the larger aim of **structural**]{.underline},
[**political** change that we seek]{.underline}. [Group-centered
organizing **generates the energy** that makes movements authentic and
bold]{.underline}. [It is the **spark** that distinguished the
world-historic SNCC from the many innocuous nonprofit organizations that
**claim** to care about social equity but do **little** to challenge
entrenched power]{.underline}; [it is the democratic life force
**missing** from]{.underline} once-vital trade [unions captured by
corrupt or complacent management]{.underline}.

[The more power is **shared**]{.underline}, [the more
**vibrant**]{.underline}, **[strong]{.underline}**, [and **durable** our
movements will be]{.underline}. [The less dependent on
high-profile]{.underline}, [charismatic messengers]{.underline}---
messengers who can be killed, co-opted, or corrupted---[or]{.underline}
white-collar [advocates who are disconnected from the daily struggles of
ordinary people]{.underline}, [the **more likely** our causes are to
**endure** and to **succeed**]{.underline}. [Broad and consistent
participation also offers a kind of **protection**]{.underline},
[keeping the muscle of solidarity from **atrophying** so we are better
positioned to **protect** and **shore up** hard-won
victories]{.underline}. [Mass organization makes it **less likely** we
will have to **refight** battles that should be behind us]{.underline}.

In 1974, toward the end of her life, Ella Baker gave a short, powerful
speech at a Puerto Rico solidarity rally, where she reminded her
audience of the important work to be done. She spoke about how, when she
was a small child, a boy called her a racial slur and she struck him in
response. "I had to learn that hitting back with my fists...was not
enough. It takes organization. It takes dedication. It takes the
willingness to stand by and do what has to be done, when it has to be
done," Baker declared.\[45\] For her, [building the power of
numbers]{.underline}--- [reaching out to others]{.underline}, including
those [who don't look or think like you]{.underline}---[was the **only
way** for regular people to overcome systemic forms of
oppression]{.underline}.

Time and again, Baker's method has prevailed. [It was organization and
dedication that enabled **Rome's plebeians** to bring the city to a
standstill]{.underline}. [The same goes for the **SNCC youth** who
risked their lives to register voters in the Deep South]{.underline};
[the **New School**]{.underline} part-time [faculty who forced the
administration to increase their wages]{.underline}; [the **disabled
people** who occupied buildings and blocked intersections to win civil
rights]{.underline}; [and the **debtors** who went on strike and forced
the government to grant billions of dollars in relief]{.underline}. Of
course, we still have far to go. But [these examples and many more
remind us that when we come together in an organized
fashion]{.underline}---[forging new self-conceptions]{.underline},
[embracing radical visions]{.underline}, [and acting
strategically]{.underline}---[we can wield the power of numbers to
**disrupt** business as usual]{.underline}, [wrest
**concessions**]{.underline}, [and pave the way for **future
victories**]{.underline}. This is why powerful interests are so
hell-bent on making sure we stay divided. It is to the long and ongoing
effort to sabotage solidarity that we turn next.

### Link---Core---1NC/2NC

#### Critique is a [market product]{.underline}. Voting aff [materially empowers]{.underline} capitalist elites and [dilutes]{.underline} revolutionary energies. 

**Boland and Stypinska, 24**---Senior Lecturer in the Department of
Sociology and Criminology, University College Cork; Lecturer in Social
Theory in the School of Political Science and Sociology at University of
Galway (Tom and Diana, "Spectres of critique: The nostalgia of social
transformation," Irish Journal of Sociology, Volume 32, Issue 3,
December 2024, dml)

While self-help style handbooks exist for these purposes (Boland and
Ponce, 2023), generally such [[discourses]{.underline}]{.mark} are
articulated in public. We stand accused and [[accuse]{.mark} each other
of [**ideology** and **complicity**]{.mark} with
oppression]{.underline}. In this, [the critic figures their audience [as
sinners who need to **confess**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and whose refusal
is taken as a symptom of **deep indoctrination**]{.underline}. This is
particularly the case around critiques of prejudice -- for instance, of
class snobbery rather than institutional critiques of capitalism. Of
course, [most critiques address the collective subject]{.underline} of
'society' [rather than individual readers]{.underline}, who may well
enact a 'negotiated reading' of the message (Hall, 1980), whereby the
critique is relevant for others, not themselves. Indeed, most readers
who choose to attend to a critique are likely already sympathetic to its
message. Nevertheless, [the orientation of critique towards conversion
emerges **clearly**]{.underline} here, [a **proselytising** attempt to
change minds and transform society]{.underline}.

Qualifications and caveats notwithstanding, an ontological model of
society and discourse emerges clearly here.
[[Critique]{.underline}]{.mark} is a discourse about society and culture
which [[assumes]{.mark} it holds the [potential to **conjure
away**]{.mark} certain elements of ideology and
[oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[if only it were **heard** and
**recognised** by a **sufficient number**]{.mark} of
people]{.underline}, [who might transform their lives and conduct
collectively]{.underline}, [spontaneously]{.underline}. In short,
[**[words are revolutionary]{.underline}**, [provided they **reveal the
truth** and]{.underline}]{.mark} [enough [people accept their]{.mark}
difficult [message]{.mark}]{.underline}. Beyond personal confessional
transformation, critique proceeds on the wish to transform others, not
just oneself. [[It implies **over-riding** the consciousness of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}, obviously in the case of 'cultural dopes',
the agency-less fools fooled of Bourdieusian sociology, but also,
[**convincing** and **converting** opponents]{.underline} -- [who are
styled as **ideologues**]{.underline}, [not **critics**]{.underline}.

In critical terms, critique is colonial, cancelling the discourses of
others and replacing them with particular perspectives (Argyrou, 2013).
From a pessimistic and tragic point of view -- the crypto-theology
commonplace within Critical Theory (Yair and Soyer, 2008), such
rationality not only cancels meaning, but replaces it with nothing but a
void. Perhaps, but what emerges most strongly here is that critique is
logocentric, not just in the sense of prioritising the written word and
its claims to reason, but in that [beliefs]{.underline}, [thoughts and
social organisation are mainly considered in terms of
**words**]{.underline}. [[Politics and social **debates** are posited as
a battle over]{.mark} **truth**]{.underline}, [over
**[words]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [With the assumption that afterwards
the word is [made **flesh**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such narratives are
commonly embodied in dystopian fiction, introductory theory courses,
political activism and beyond. Clearly, words matter, discourse has
consequences, yet these are often unintended and problematic
consequences.

Critique begets critique

[The first consequence]{.underline} of critique [is the
**proliferation** of critical discourses and practices]{.underline}.
[Communicating critically can inspire others to adopt and adapt critical
forms of discourse]{.underline}, whether with or [**against the grain**
of the]{.underline} political or normative standpoint of the [original
critic]{.underline}. Examples of this abound, for instance, Nagle\'s
digital ethnography of the alt-right (2017), which traced how leftist
critique was re-weaponised by its opponents. Similarly, Davies has
observed the eclipse of the possibility of critique leading to consensus
as imagined by French Pragmatic School (2021), because [**no agreement
is possible** where all]{.underline} '[orders of worth]{.underline}'
[are critiqued]{.underline}. For instance, today a majority of white
Americans consider that white people are a racial minority subject to
racial discrimination (Lowery, 2023). Thus, decades of anti-racist
critique have become adapted into a peculiar counter-critique (cf:
Diken, 2012).

Secondly, [[the proliferation of critique gives way to a **critical
recoil**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, in the emergence of the
backlash against feminism, which presents feminism as an oppressive
social ideology (Faludi, 2009). [[Rather than]{.mark} always provoking
[**enlightenment** or **awakening**]{.mark} by convincing
others]{.underline}, [critique [can lead to **opposition** or
**entrenchment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is traced in detail in Nash
and Browne\'s Heteroactivism (2020) which concerns opposition to LGBT
rights and acceptance. The emergence of social movements against queer
critics, along lines of confrontation as varied as marriage and adoption
rights for same-sex couples to trans-visibility emerges here not as the
retrenchment of ideology, but as a
**[[counter-critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For the authors,
contemporary 'heteroactivists' have learned to side-step simple
accusations of 'homophobia' or 'transphobia' and [[present]{.mark}
themselves [as]{.mark}]{.underline} caring for all citizens, especially
children, and protecting free speech and especially religious values,
including minorities. Heteroactivists are **[[not simply
ideologues]{.underline}]{.mark}**, howsoever we disagree with their
perspectives, [[they]{.mark} clearly [deploy critical
tropes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [critique often provokes
**opposition** rather than **conversion**]{.underline}.

Thirdly, critical discourses and practices do not simply occur within
the public sphere, but are articulated by critics. Thus, critique as it
diffuses throughout the polity tends to form critical subjectivity. For
critical thinkers, for instance, Judith Butler, critical subjectivity is
generated when subjects are threatened with abjection, which can lead to
compliance or to resistance and the transformation of the subject into a
critic (2004). For Foucault, critique was generally figured as a
resistance to power, identified as counter-conduct to governmentality
for instance, and eventually situated within the tradition of parrhesia
or 'speaking truth to power' (Foucault, 2011). However, it is also
possible to see how [critics are **governmentally formed**]{.underline},
[compelled to reiterate certain critical discourses as liberal
subjects]{.underline} (Stypinska, 2020). [A **plethora** of
[arenas]{.mark}]{.underline}, from education (Felski, 2015) to social
media serve to instruct subjects in various critical routines
(Stypinska, 2022), and there are even popular handbooks and guides
[[which offer to **remodel** their readers]{.mark} as better
critics]{.underline} (Boland, 2019).

A fourth consequence of critique is the re-direction or redeployment of
critique, often described as the '**[[co-opt]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing'
of [critique]{.underline} -- for instance, Boltanski and Chiapello\'s
work on how capitalism reuses artistic or 'hippy' critiques (2007).
Similarly, research has long drawn attention to how [[critical ideas of
standing against the]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[status
quo]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[or being **authentic**]{.mark} or
**individualistic** [have been used by advertising]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Frank, 1997). Indeed, the whole arena of [the]{.underline} '**[culture
industry]{.underline}**' decried by Adorno and Horkheimer is less the
arena of dreams and ideology than it [is a **windmill** of
critique]{.underline}, [where]{.underline} '**[dissent is the
system]{.underline}**' (Heath, 2001: 16).

As identified by Horkheimer and Adorno, [a consequence]{.underline} of
critique or enlightenment [is the **displacement of
meaning**]{.underline}: 'On their way toward modern science human beings
have discarded meaning' (2002: 3). The contemporary post-critical turn
in literary and aesthetic studies elaborates this more precisely,
tracing how [critical [discourse **reduces** meaning to a **smokescreen
for power**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Felski, 2015). Alternatively,
[critical discourse [celebrates the discourse of
marginal]{.mark}]{.underline} or unusual [[figures]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[gives a voice]{.mark} and
platform [**only** to those]{.mark} [who]{.mark}se work and words [can
be **welded** to a critical narrative]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pels, 1999).
Thus, a fifth consequence of critique is the [reinscribing]{.underline}
of [other discourses in a critical idiom]{.underline}, [**displacing**
all others]{.underline}, because critique, like enlightenment, is
totalitarian -- if that is not too critical!

There are many more consequences to critique, intended and unintended.
Such consequences generate changes within society, but are not always
transformational in the sense that critics hope or imagine. Indeed, the
most impactful revolution of our times is the neo-liberal revolution,
which has transformed economy and society through critique of the
welfare state and market regulation, promoting 'liberty' (Foucault,
2008). Strikingly, neo-liberal critique represents individuals as
self-serving utility-maximisers, a cynical view wherein culture and
society are 'mere constructs'. Of course, for its critics,
neo-liberalism is ideological, but suchlike positions tend to assume a
monopoly over critique on the left and fail to grasp the numerous
consequences elaborated above.

Nursery tale of critique

In the preamble to the Manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx and Engels
spoke of a 'holy alliance' forged between the powers of 'old Europe' in
order to exorcise the Spectre of Communism that haunted them (2004).
This Spectre of **[[Communism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, alike that of
critique today, carried the promise of transformation. Unlike
contemporary critique, however, it [[proved itself **utterly
unbearable** to]{.mark} those in positions of
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, [constituting a **radical threat** to the
status quo]{.underline}, [which the latter could not pass
over]{.underline}. So much so, that at that time 'the branding reproach
of communism' (Marx and Engels, 2004) took on the status of a general
discursive trend, extending beyond the attempts at the foreclosure of
radical ideas and encompassing many routine efforts to decry one\'s
opponents. This, according to Marx and Engels, attested to the fact that
'Communism \[was\] already acknowledged by all European powers to be
itself a power' (2004). Their objective in writing the Manifesto was to
'meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism' head on, by making
Communist views, aims, and tendencies, plain to the world (2004).

Today\'s spectre -- that of critique -- comes with its own nursery tale.
[Critique]{.underline}, [this tale tells us]{.underline}, [is
**good**]{.underline}, [and the **more** of it]{.underline}, [the
**better**]{.underline}. [Critique]{.underline}, it maintains, [is the
pursuit of courageous heroes]{.underline}, [who dare to know and speak
the truth]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} -- [as if by
**magic**]{.underline} -- [brings about ever more progress]{.underline}.
Thereby painted as the eternal bastion of social transformation,
critique is seen as unequivocally enlightened and enlightening, as are,
of course, its proponents.

The fact that this nursery tale of the spectre of critique does not
discriminate is far from surprising. After all, as is the case with all
children\'s stories, it is meant to be both narrative and narrativizing,
and hence, totalized and totalizing. It would be a mistake, however, to
simply dismiss the branding commendation of critique that it installs as
an innocuous fairytale. In fact, as we intend to demonstrate, the [tale
of]{.underline} the spectre of [[critique **operationalizes the status
quo**]{.underline}]{.mark}, breeding, what Marcuse refers to as,
one-dimensionality, that is, an attitude of conformity 'to existing
thought and behaviour' characterized by a lack of 'a critical dimension
of potentialities that transcend the existing society' (2007: xxvii).

For the most part, in a somewhat uncanny rendition of Adorno\'s and
Horkheimer\'s diagnosis of Enlightenment (2002), critique today appears
to be [[reduced to]{.mark} nothing more than a
**[procedure]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- a procedure [giving way to
manifold discourses and practices]{.underline}, [but **scarcely
transforming** anything or anyone]{.underline}. To be sure, amidst the
growing (post)political polarisation, whirlpools of 'culture wars' and
'social media frenzies', [critique]{.underline} today [denotes less of a
change than **stasis**]{.underline}. As demonstrated above, [critical
endeavours are increasingly]{.underline} countermandable, if not,
indeed, fungible. Critical register, in short, for all its disruptive
tendencies, appears, above all, to be the one of **[business as
usual]{.underline}**, [[where **quantifiable**]{.underline}]{.mark} (and
mostly economic) [**[effects]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [rather than
**qualities** and **meanings**]{.underline}, [[rule]{.mark} the
roost]{.underline}.

Faced with such a critical impasse, one would expect the nursery tale of
critique to proclaim the current state of affairs to be a bastardisation
of the noble 'Critical Project', and to rally us to embrace its timeless
coordinates. But it stays silent, for, as mentioned already, it is but a
tale and not capable of differentiation. This does not, however, render
it inconsequential to the current critical predicament. To the contrary,
its silence provokes two opposite -- yet non-dialectically unified --
tendencies: the nostalgic and the managerial.

Firstly, the nursery tale induces nostalgia, a retreat from reality into
longing for [an idealized]{.underline}, [totalized]{.underline} version
of the past [critique]{.underline}. 'Nostalgia', argues Lasch, 'evokes
the past only to bury it alive' (1991: 116). It '[**obscures** the
connections between the past and the present]{.underline}', [giving
us]{.underline} '[a **one-dimensional** view of history in which a
[**wistful pessimism** and]{.mark} a kind of [**fatalistic optimism**
are the only points of reference]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Lasch,
1991: 14). Failing to recognize the ongoing significance of the past
within the present, the nostalgic embrace of the ahistorical nursery
tale of [critique offers us **no way out** of the critical
impasse]{.underline}, effectively [entrapping us within it]{.underline}.
Hence, [[it **exorcises** the potential to **actualize**]{.mark} the
power of]{.underline} the spectre of [critique]{.underline}, [turning
particular]{.underline}, [historically contingent practices]{.underline}
of critique [into **atemporal magical spells**]{.underline}, which, for
some mysterious reasons, can no longer be cast, only longed for.

Crucially, in buoying up the nostalgia for critique, the tale of the
spectre of critique provides a counterbalance to the disenchantment (cf:
Weber, 1958) and demythologization (cf: Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002)
accomplished by the positivistic rationality -- a counterbalance that
paradoxically secures the persistence of the latter. [The desire for the
magical power of truth is the **mirror image** of the fetishization of
positivism]{.underline}. Whilst the former forsakes the present for the
sake of total transcendence, the latter forsakes the future for the sake
of pure immanence. The nostalgia for critique constituted by the
totalizing narrativization is therefore nothing but, to borrow Lasch\'s
expression, 'the other side of the ideology of progress' (1991: 14).

Secondly, the nursery tale of critique provokes the drive towards
utility. We hence encounter various administrative measures aimed at the
management of forms of critique that do not conform to the dominant
one-dimensional outlook (see Stypinska, 2020). Fully embracing the
ideology of progress, they warn against critical subtraction and
'overcritique' (Kilminster, 2023), advocating positivistic
multiplication (Latour, 2004), and reducing critique to a regulatory
mechanism (Boltanski and Chiapello, 2007). The nostalgic retreat from
the present is substituted here with the total validation of the actual.
The yearning for the magical power of truth is replaced with
instrumental knowledge, that is, the one that, in repeating the actual,
turns thought into tautology (cf: Horkheimer and Adorno, 2002: 20).

Marx and Engels set out to dispel the ideological narrative of the
nursery tale of the spectre of communism in order to embrace, and bring
into being, the revolutionary potential of that very spectre. Today\'s
capture of the spectre of critique by its own nursery tale, however,
seems to be so effective, that we find ourselves incapable of conceiving
the radical spirit of critique outside of it. Neither nostalgia nor
managerialism offer a transformative direction. In fact, they both
prevent us from pursuing one. United in a disjunctive synthesis -- that
is, 'a synthesis whose binary poles are mutually exclusive but
nevertheless presuppose \[...\] each other and are interlocked within
the same classificatory scheme' (Diken, 2009: 4) -- nostalgia and
managerialism both exemplify a totalizing and totalitarian approach
towards critique, ritualizing it. Whereas nostalgia turns critique into
an impotent magical spell, managerialism turns it into a regulatory
procedure bent on fine-tuning the status quo. In short, the first reacts
to instrumental rationality, whilst the second embodies it.

Mythology of critique

Accordingly, today, it is not only critique that is totalitarian. The
dominant approaches towards it exemplify the same tendencies.
Enlightenment, as dissected by Horkheimer and Adorno (2002), thus
features not only as the condition of possibility of contemporary
critique, but also of the prepotent ways of relating to it. Crucially,
for all the negativity attributed to Dialectic of Enlightenment (2002)
-- one, admittedly, amplified by our analysis so far -- the text does
not confer the totalitarian traits as inevitable. On the contrary, the
critique it puts forth is that of historical tendencies of
Enlightenment, which are by no means innate to the concept itself. The
impossibility of fundamental change -- which Adorno and Horkheimer
reveal as characteristic of both ancient myths of fate and modern
positivism (2002) -- is so forcibly stressed only so that it can be
revoked. Recognition of mythological tendencies, in short, opens up a
possibility of dispelling the myths.

Likewise, any transformation-oriented analysis of contemporary critique
ought to begin with unpacking the mythology inherent to the tradition
from which today\'s critique emerged. That is to say, to paraphrase
Horkheimer (1982), the task at hand is to give voice to the mystery of
the existing reality of critique. In what is to follow, we shall focus
on three interrelated aspects of this mystery: absolutization,
fetishization and reification.

Enlightenment, argue Adorno and Horkheimer, 'amputates the
incommensurable': 'only what can be encompassed by unity has the status
of an existent or an event; its ideal is the system from which
everything and anything follows' (2002: 9, 4). The same is the case with
contemporary critique: it is both absolutized and absolutizing. Today\'s
overabundance of critical subjectivities, truths, narratives,
discourses, positions, etc., is but a sign of a dictatorship of
positivistic reason, of its endlessly multiplying reign. Everything is
turned into critique -- or, it does not register as in existence. Within
such a system, there is no need for differentiation. After all,
positivistic criticality only concerns itself with knowing what it can
manipulate. As such, it strives to flatten everything out, portraying
all entities -- be they, phenomena, concepts, or ideas -- as
interchangeable.

Absolutization of critique positions equivalence as the only
recognizable quality. It therefore renders the distinction between
critical phenomena, conceptions of critique, and the idea of critique
redundant (see Stypinska, 2020). In circumscribing our perception within
the horizontal plane of fungibility, absolutization exorcises the need
for philosophical concepts, whose purpose, according to Benjamin, is
'the salvation of phenomena in ideas' (2003: 33). Concepts carry a
two-fold mediating function: they 'enable phenomena to participate in
the existence of ideas' and allow for 'the representation of ideas
through the medium of empirical reality' (Benjamin, 2003: 34). Without
concepts we lose the connection to ideas, and hence the ability to
transcend the status quo and break the taboo of the pure immanence of
positivism.

Absolutization is a correlate of [the fetishization of
critique]{.underline}, which [**prevents** problematization of the
coordinates of the existing society]{.underline}, [**restricting**
critique to techniques]{.underline} (cf: Adorno, 2005: 160). Here too
[[we encounter the **separation**]{.mark} of the critical imperative
[from the objective]{.mark} of fundamental change]{.underline}.
[Fetishization denotes **domestication** of critique]{.underline}, that
is, [[its reduction to a **mere method**]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[accustomed to [asking questions about]{.mark} the nature of
discourse]{.underline}, [of [mutual understanding]{.mark}]{.underline},
respect, and recognition, and concerns about justification and human
rights' (Thompson, 2016: 2). [Such domesticated critique [is **no longer
in radical tension** with the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[but]{.underline}, rather, in taking on a 'pragmatic' orientation,
[becomes its **dynamo**]{.underline}. It rejects dissensus (Rancière,
2010) for the sake of disputes (Boltanski, 2011), fixating on, and
affixing itself to, the existing social reality. [Its discursive
attempts are **easily co-opted**]{.underline}, [oftentimes
**reversed**]{.underline}, [and frequently **commodified**]{.underline}.
The deficit of fundamental critique of growth as an ideological category
in the policy arena, which reduces sustainability to 'a watchword for
compromise', positioning greenwashing as one of its core tools (Miller,
2017), is but one example. Another one is that of the increasing focus
on representation, rather than the systemic roots of racism, within the
analyses of media, which, in prompting critiques of whitewashing and
calls for 'colourblind casting', produces a backlash against so-called
blackwashing. And, to give one more, the foregoing of the structural
analysis of gender inequalities, manifested so boldly within the
critiques put forth by the postfeminists, initiated 'commodity feminism'
(Goldman, 1992), culminating in an apolitical post-critique (Lazar,
2009). As evident in these examples, fetishized [critiques are **part**
and **parcel** of governmentality]{.underline}, [which they
operationalize]{.underline}. Furthermore, due to their commendable aura,
critical techniques are increasingly embraced as a duty (Stypinska,
2020).

Last but not least, the existing reality of critique is underpinned by
reification, that is, the abstraction of critical labour. In short, [our
critical activities become **estranged** from ourselves]{.underline}.
Featuring as something objective and independent, critiques confront us
as mysterious forces that generate their own powers -- forces that exert
control over us (cf: Lukács, 1972). At the most basic level, this is
evident in the general way in which we tend to approach critique: we
focus on the product, rather that the producer (see, for instance,
Latour, 2004). Consequently, to borrow Lukács' expression, critic
features as a mere 'mechanical part incorporated into a mechanical
system', which functions independently of her and demands conformity to
its laws (1972: 89). Examples of this abound, from the routine
employment of academic methods such as critical discourse analysis, to
the proliferation of critic careers (ranging all the way from art
critics to conspiracy theorists). Here, [the [products of critical
labour]{.mark}]{.underline} are the outcome of following a
pre-designated process, on which the critics have very little to no
purchase. More often than not, critiques [end up [function]{.mark}ing
[**independently** of them in the wider market]{.mark}]{.underline} (of
academic publications, for instance, or the media). The social relations
between individuals assume the form of a relation between critiques.
[The forces of]{.underline} the critical market -- or, rather, [[the
**market of critiques**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [appear to [exist
**independently** of any]{.mark} individual
[critic]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with each desiring their critique to
dominate the field]{.underline}]{.mark}, much [[like a
**brand**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

'Reification', argues Lukács, 'requires that a society should learn to
satisfy all its needs in terms of commodity exchange' (1972: 91).
Marcuse shows that it achieves this requirement by implanting false
needs, which 'are superimposed upon the individual by particular social
interests in his repression' (2007: 5). The mythology of critique
establishes one-dimensional criticality precisely as such a need,
entangling critique with (the desire for) domination to the point of
turning it into an instrument of oppression. [The duty to critique
is]{.underline} hence [a correlate of the]{.underline} '**[despotic
imperative]{.underline}**' (Diken, 2019) whereat [critical impulse is
**captured** and turned into power **over** the critic]{.underline}.
Here [we encounter the key paradox]{.underline} of today\'s critique:
[its promise to emancipate us from domination culminates in our
reduction to **cogs** in the despotic machine]{.underline}.

### Link---Consensus---1NC/2NC

#### Voting aff makes solidarity [harder]{.underline} to generate by prioritizing theoretical [consensus]{.underline} over [collective organizing]{.underline}.

**Inouye, 23**---Assistant Professor of Political Studies at Bard
College (Mie, "Solidarity Now," Boston Review, Summer 2023, dml)

Political theorists and organizers have long debated the possible basis
for solidarity in societies structured by dominance. [If solidarity
simply means]{.underline} collective action based on [recognition of
**shared interests**]{.underline}, [it would seem that there can be no
solidarity **across** lines of domination]{.underline}, [as the
interests of those who dominate **diverge** from the]{.underline}
interests of those who are [dominated]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} gap [generates a **cruel paradox**]{.underline}, at
least if we accept that such alliances---between dominant and dominated
racial groups within the working class, say, or between the traditional
working class and the so-called "professional-managerial class"
(PMC)---are necessary to redress racial and economic domination in the
United States. On the one hand, [solidarity is an **essential**
component of]{.underline} struggles for [justice]{.underline}, but on
the other hand, [actually existing injustice renders it
**impossible**]{.underline}. What do we do when [winning material
changes to the social world requires assembling coalitions of people who
**do not**]{.underline}---[and perhaps **cannot**]{.underline}---[share
the same motivations]{.underline} for organizing? What kind of
solidarity is possible when our motivations for organizing diverge, or
when we don't even know what they are?

Some theorists present morality as the way to close the gap between the
interests of dominant and dominated groups. In Race and the Politics of
Solidarity (2009), for example, political theorist Juliet Hooker argues
that, in racialized societies, solidarity is also racialized.
"Solidarity requires that we care about the pain and suffering of
others," she writes. "But embodied racial difference renders the pain
and suffering of nonwhites either invisible or, when visible, less
deserving of empathy and redress." Given this reality, a prerequisite to
solidarity between members of dominant and dominated racial groups is a
transformation of the former's "ethical-political perspective." On this
view, white people in the United States must learn to see themselves
"seeing whitely." In other words, they must come to recognize that race
regularly blinds them to the pain and suffering of nonwhites.

How can whites achieve this realization? For Hooker, the answer lies in
public contestation over policies that could redress past and continuing
disadvantage. Such contestation holds the potential to reshape the
political community's public memory with regard to race. But even if
public debate over policing, reparations, and abolition of the
prison-industrial complex could promote the kind of moral transformation
Hooker envisions, can we expect fundamental changes in behavior to
follow?

In a recent article, political scientist Jared Clemons argues that [it
is a **mistake** to think that even the **most sincerely felt**
antiracism will translate into antiracist **behavior**]{.underline}
under neoliberal capitalism. Clemons's premise is that the recognition
of shared class interests with Black Americans is a precondition of
whites' long-term commitment to substantive antiracist policies.
[Morality is not **irrelevant**]{.underline}, Clemons thinks, [but moral
commitment alone is **insufficient**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, he
argues, [neoliberal capitalism]{.underline} has undermined the
conditions for such recognition in two crucial ways.

First, it [has]{.underline} "**[privatized]{.underline}** racial
[responsibility]{.underline}," [predisposing]{.underline} white
[people]{.underline}---particularly white liberal members of the
PMC---[to make merely **symbolic**]{.underline} antiracist [commitments
that do not threaten their dominant class position or social
status]{.underline}, [rather than supporting **state programs** that
would address]{.underline} structural racial [injustices]{.underline}.
At the same time, Clemons argues that the white PMC is currently much
more readily available to movements for racial justice than the white
working class. He cites Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign
and A "Freedom Budget" for All Americans (1967), written by A. Phillip
Randolph and Bayard Rustin, as examples of the kind of multiracial,
working-class coalitions necessary to achieve a material transformation
of society, but he is pessimistic about the possibility that such
coalitions will emerge under present conditions. The gap between the
interests of participants in recent movements for racial justice is just
too wide.

Clemons's careful attention to the material conditions of neoliberal
capitalism and their implications for solidarity is useful. But if he is
right that the white PMC is the most accessible base of white Americans
for today's movements for racial and economic justice, then a
thoroughgoing materialist analysis should identify not only avenues for
organizing the traditional white working class, but also ways of working
with the contradictions of the PMC.

[What seems **crucial**]{.underline} to this effort [is **not** that
everyone involved]{.underline} in today's movements [share the same
**motivations** or even the same **objective interests** but that
everyone have something at stake that they feel
**viscerally**]{.underline}. In an interview with Stevphen Shukaitis,
Fred [**Moten** highlights the role of **personal stakes**]{.underline}
in the concept of coalition embraced by the original Rainbow
Coalition---the cross-racial movement forged by Fred Hampton (of the
Black Panthers), William Fesperman (of the socialist, mostly white Young
Patriots Organization), and José Cha Cha Jiménez (of the predominantly
Puerto Rican Young Lords). As Moten puts it:

The problematic of coalition is that [coalition isn't something that
emerges so that you can come help me]{.underline}, a maneuver that
always gets traced back to your own interests. [The coalition emerges
out of your recognition that it's fucked up for **you**]{.underline},
[in the **same way** that we've already recognized that it's fucked up
for **us**]{.underline}. [I don't need your **help**]{.underline}. [I
just need you to recognize that this shit is **killing
you**]{.underline}, **[too]{.underline}**, **[however much more
softly]{.underline}**, you stupid motherfucker, you know?

For the reasons Clemons gives, [we might doubt the possibility of
interest convergence]{.underline} ("it's fucked up for you, in the same
way that . . . it's fucked up for us"), depending on the class position
of the imagined white interlocutor. [But]{.underline} note that [Moten's
emphasis is on shared]{.underline} "**[recognition]{.underline}**," [not
shared **conditions** of domination or oppression]{.underline}. In other
words, the sameness he describes applies to the process of realization,
not to the interests of the people involved. [The promise of coalition
is that we can work together **across** difference to change the
prevailing social arrangement **without** fully transcending the ways
that it differentiates us and even pits us against each
other]{.underline}.

Maybe [a better basis for solidarity]{.underline} than either morality
or material interest, then---at least around racial injustice in the
United States today---[is]{.underline} ideology: [a **shared vision** of
a just society that **aligns** with but **exceeds** our material
interests]{.underline}, [that motivates us both because it would make
our lives **tangibly better** and because we find it **inspiring** and
**attractive**]{.underline}. This seems to be what political theorist
Jodi Dean has in mind when she writes in Comrade: An Essay on Political
Belonging (2019) that "comradeship binds action, and in this binding . .
. it collectivizes and directs action in light of a shared vision for
the future." [This]{.underline} kind of shared vision [does not
materialize out of our **individual pursuits**]{.underline}, [nor does
it emerge from **protest alone**]{.underline}. And, as Moten's open
expression of antipathy toward his imagined comrade suggests, forging
such a vision across difference necessarily involves conflict.

In June 2020, I, like millions of other Americans, left the isolation of
my apartment, where I had been watching footage of the Minneapolis
protests, to join other breathing, sweating bodies in the streets. We
were in the streets to protest the murders of George Floyd, Breonna
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, among many other Black Americans. But we were
also there because we were dying of being alone and we needed to be
pressed up against each other in a crowd. We were there because we were
unemployed or facing the prospect of unemployment, because our jobs were
killing us, because we or our loved ones were sick and dying and the
state was indifferent to our plight. And we were there because we felt
that these reasons were somehow connected to each other and to Floyd's
death. But forging those connections explicitly would have involved
conflict, risk, and time. It was easier and safer to default to
"allyship" or even a straight-up politics of deference.

I often ask my students what the summer of 2020 was like for them. For
almost all of them, it was their first and only experience of a social
movement. Some describe being in a crowd of people who were blocking a
highway or a bridge and realizing, for the first time in their lives,
that everyone around them was sincere in what they were doing. Others
describe experiences of tear gas and tanks that gave them a visceral
understanding of the state's repressive power.

But another feeling my students express in the wake of 2020 is a deep
skepticism about the possibility or even desirability of solidarity
across difference. Even though we recently experienced one of the most
remarkable displays of interracial solidarity in our country's history,
interracial solidarity---and solidarity across any form of difference,
for that matter---seems less plausible now than it did before 2020.
There are many enduring legacies of the George Floyd rebellions, but I
think we can say that a sustained multiracial movement against policing
and mass incarceration is not among them.

Could it have been otherwise? It is a common folly of left intellectuals
and organizers to critique movements for not having been differently
composed or executed. As Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward famously
argue in Poor People's Movements (1977), opportunities for protest are
socially structured. Popular insurgency "flows from historically
specific circumstances," they write: "it is a reaction against those
circumstances, and it is also limited by those circumstances." It is
therefore futile to critique movements for failing to conform to our
theories about how protest ought to proceed. Still, the point of
organizing, as I understand it, is to prepare to make the most of
socially structured opportunities for protest. And in preparation for
the next opportunity, the left needs to build more organizations in
which differently situated people can uncover and articulate their needs
and forge demands that connect them. We also need to find an approach to
the problem of divergent interests that accepts the insights of
standpoint theory without defaulting to deference.

The best text I have found on the process of uncovering needs through
organizing is the footage of Illinois Black Panther Party section leader
Bob Lee organizing white working-class people in Chicago in the 1969
documentary American Revolution 2. As Jakobi Williams details in From
the Bullet to the Ballot (2015), the Illinois Black Panthers used this
documentary, produced by The Film Group, to found the Rainbow Coalition
and to teach their organizing model to other chapters.

The most compelling part of the documentary is a scene where Lee comes
to a meeting in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago organized by the
Young Patriots. The purpose of the gathering is to organize the
Patriots' base to disrupt an upcoming meeting about the Model Cities
program, a federal antipoverty initiative that the Patriots felt shut
out community input. Lee works the room with incredible skill.
Repeatedly, he asks the white people, who look awkward and even a little
scared, "What do you want?"

When I ask my students to identify the tactics Lee uses to organize the
people in the room, they note his use of physical proximity and touch.
Lee is always on his feet, moving around the room and touching his
interlocutors. At one point, he places his hands in the hair of a
sixteen-year-old white boy named Roger who declares his desire to fight
the police. In this moment, Lee's hands express care and authority,
reminding the boy of his youth and inexperience. "Before you can do
that," he says, "there's got to be some discipline." At another moment,
Lee's hands are on the shoulders of a middle-aged white man who sits
with his arms crossed and looks uncomfortable. Later, they grasp the
hands of a reticent young white woman with a toddler. Lee eventually
lifts the woman to her feet and insists that she tell the room what
she's been going through. She finally speaks, and, as she describes
witnessing her brother being stabbed in the back by a cop, her facial
expression changes from fear to confidence and conviction.

I think my students are struck by the physicality of Lee's approach to
organizing because touching strangers in this way is completely
unimaginable to them. In the same way, it is hard for them to imagine
disagreeing openly with strangers or insisting that other people share
their experiences of oppression. But what is solidarity if not the
choice to bump up against other people, figuratively, if not literally,
and allow oneself to be changed by the impact?

When I asked my students why they thought Lee insisted that the young
white woman speak, a non-white student from a working-class background
responded, "Because she needed to figure out why she was there." I left
class wondering what it would take for my students to be able to ask
each other, "Why are you taking this class on Identity Politics? What do
you want?" and for all of them, including those who were white and
upper-middle-class, to know and share their answers.

Lee's approach to multiracial organizing stands in stark contrast to
deference politics, an approach to coalition building that requires
relatively privileged people to accept less privileged people's reasons
for organizing as their own. Perhaps for the sorts of reasons Clemons
identifies, deference politics has become the dominant approach to
coalition building in our moment.

Deference politics is also the dominant practical application of
standpoint theory, which originates in Marxist feminist and Black
feminist thought. The basic premises of standpoint theory are as
follows. First, knowledge is socially situated; it reflects the
perspective of the knower, which, in turn, is shaped by their social
location. Second, oppressed groups are socially located in ways that can
make it easier for them to understand how society is structured, to
expose existing social arrangements as contingent, and to analyze those
arrangements in relation to universal human interests. And third,
dominant groups are socially situated in ways that can make it easier
for them to analyze the social world in relation to dominant group
interests and to misrepresent existing social arrangements as necessary,
natural, or universally beneficial.

As philosopher Olúfemi Táíwò argues in Elite Capture (2022), these
premises are difficult to dispute. Experiences of oppression tend to
predispose people to develop critiques of existing social arrangements
and insights into possible alternatives. At the same time, Táíwò
observes, [oppression does not necessarily yield **strategic
insight**]{.underline}, **[political wisdom]{.underline}**, [or
**clarity** about one's own motives and interests]{.underline}; [the
harm it produces can also be **incapacitating**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[people are capable of developing knowledge that **transcends** their
own lived experience through **studying**]{.underline},
**[organizing]{.underline}**, [and **getting to know differently
situated people**]{.underline}, [and no person is **fully knowable** on
the basis of even the most fine-grained analysis of their social
location]{.underline}. From this perspective, [the problem]{.underline}
with deference politics [is]{.underline} not its appeal to the premises
of standpoint theory but its application of them: [the tendency to treat
people as **fully determined**]{.underline}, [rather than only
**influenced**]{.underline}, [by their social
location]{.underline}---[and to assume we are **fully transparent** to
ourselves and to others]{.underline}.

Still, [deference politics]{.underline} can be attractive, in part
because it [can serve as a tool for **evading** conflict]{.underline}.
[If my perspective is **irrelevant**]{.underline}, [there is **no
chance** that you and I will have **salient disagreements** over our
shared goals or the best means of achieving them]{.underline}. [If I
am]{.underline} relatively [privileged]{.underline}, [**acknowledging**
and **discrediting** my perspective in advance **insulates** me from
being accused of]{.underline} racism, sexism, or classism---as well as
from the awkwardness of **[disagreeing]{.underline}** with someone who
is relatively oppressed. But [coalitions formed through deference
are]{.underline} also **[extremely fragile]{.underline}**,
[because]{.underline}, as Moten suggests, [the perspective of
the]{.underline} relatively [privileged]{.underline} person [is **not
irrelevant**]{.underline}. [It will **inevitably emerge** in the process
of organizing]{.underline}. [If an organization lacks the capacity to
**negotiate conflicts** between divergent perspectives]{.underline}, [it
will **quickly dissolve**]{.underline}. Moreover, [unless people know
**why** they are at the protest or meeting and feel the stakes of their
participation **viscerally**]{.underline}, [they **won't stick around**
through the inevitable setbacks and frustrations involved in
organizing]{.underline}.

The past few years have given us some very useful critiques of deference
politics, Táíwò's among them. What's lacking, I think, is a practical
alternative that takes seriously the essential insight of standpoint
theory---that social location influences what we can know about the
social world, and, in particular, about the sources of and potential
means of countering oppression. Táíwò offers "constructive
politics"---collective attempts to build "power in and through
institutions and networks"---as an alternative to deference politics.
Where deference politics focuses our energies on redistributing power
within "the room" in which we find ourselves (a boardroom, a university,
a neighborhood association, a union, and so on), constructive politics
aims to "build a new house." But constructive politics does not
necessarily involve attending to the ways social location influences
knowledge. Think, for example, of approaches to labor organizing that
are inattentive to the roles of race, gender, or sexuality in the
organization of the workplace. Knowledge about intersecting forms of
oppression is crucial to getting the right answers about what kinds of
houses we ought to build---and to acknowledging and responsibly
navigating the power dynamics within the room in the meantime.

Perhaps [**epistemic humility** is an alternative practical
application]{.underline} of standpoint theory. [To be epistemically
humble is to hold one's beliefs]{.underline} about the social world
[**open to challenge** and **reformulation**]{.underline}, [while
retaining the ultimate responsibility for **judgment**]{.underline}.
[Epistemic humility requires that we acknowledge that our perspectives
are **limited**]{.underline}, [that we cannot fully see their contours
in **advance**]{.underline}, [and that we are capable of understanding
**beyond** the limits of our own lived experience]{.underline}. [If we
are open to the possibility that we might be **wrong** about important
things]{.underline} and, in many ways, ill-equipped to be good comrades
because of our own past experiences, [we can **learn** from one
another's experiences and from the experience of organizing
**together**]{.underline}. In other words, [**solidarity** becomes
possible]{.underline} when we embrace organizing as a mechanism of
political education, a way of being transformed, for everyone
involved---dominated and dominator; Black, Asian, and white;
working-class and PMC.

Henry's question at the spring fundraiser helped me clarify my own
reasons for organizing, which begin with my family. My Japanese family
became American by way of Mormonism, which was the form of solidarity
available to them in the aftermath of World War II, when my
great-grandparents and their children were interned in Wyoming. Through
the internment, they lost their farms, their homes, and a generation of
accumulated wealth.

My grandparents met, married, and had their first child in the camp.
After they were released, they relocated to a small agricultural
community in central Utah. Like many Nisei who had been interned, they
did their best to assimilate; they named their children after American
presidents and didn't teach them Japanese. They rarely spoke about the
camp except to recall their wedding banquet. And although they were
practicing Buddhists, they sent their children to the Mormon church so
that they would get religious training and learn how to be Americans.

The church helped my family to survive the brutality of racial
capitalism, primarily by providing us with a sense of belonging and a
network that helped my father and his siblings succeed socially,
academically, and professionally. My father often recalls the first
church social he ever attended. Each guest received a giant sugar cookie
frosted with a thick layer of pink buttercream. This cookie---a staple
of Mormon food culture---seemed to my five-year-old father as big as his
head. It tasted like nothing his Sansei tongue had ever encountered. The
fact that he, a small Japanese boy whose family had recently arrived in
Utah, had been given one of his own meant that he, too, belonged.

At the same time that it gave us a community, the church facilitated my
family's assimilation to what Daniel Martinez HoSang, in his recent book
A Wider Type of Freedom (2021), calls "Caucasian democracy"---"an
approach to governance that takes human hierarchy, the accumulation of
profit, and the unequal distribution of life and death as core
premises." Mormons were not always on board with this form of democracy.
In the nineteenth century they practiced a version of socialism called
the United Order, and some prominent leaders were abolitionists
(although the church was in many respects racist and, from 1852 to 1978,
official church policy was anti-Black). But by the time that my family
joined the church, Mormons were well into the process of assimilating
into mainstream American society, including American capitalism. The
church offered my family an ideology that linked private wealth
accumulation and the heteronormative family to U.S. citizenship, and
gave them hope in their ability to achieve not only eternal life but the
American Dream.

My childhood in the Northeast was far removed from these sites of trauma
and assimilation, but I felt this history when I visited Utah each
summer---in my family's intense work ethic, in my uncles' reactionary
political views, which eventually led some of them to embrace Trumpism,
and in my uncles' and aunties' misdirected bursts of anger.

My uncle (I will call him Gerald here), the patriarch of our family,
exemplified all of these tendencies---and a certain version of
solidarity, too. Gerald was the only family member of my father's
generation to stay in the small rural town where they grew up. He did
not return to the farm, as my grandfather had hoped someone would;
instead he became a rural doctor and dedicated himself to providing
affordable health care to the community, often footing the bill for
patients who could not afford to pay. He raised the funds to build a new
middle school in town and mentored many generations of local youth.

Uncle Gerald's generosity was matched by his intolerance of deviations
from the social norms that structured our family. When, as children, we
scraped our knees while working on the farm or recreating in the
mountains, we knew never to cry or complain for fear of being mocked.
When, as an adult, I wrote an op-ed in the Salt Lake Tribune urging
Mormons to stop paying tithing to the church until its leadership
reversed a homophobic policy, I learned through a cousin that Uncle
Gerald was furious that I would presume to tell him what to do.

In December 2020 Uncle Gerald died of COVID-19. On one level, his death,
like every coronavirus death, was an avoidable consequence of the
capitalist system that produced the pandemic and the state's failure to
manage it. At the same time, his personality and ideological
orientation, including his recklessness, his libertarian leanings, and
his fierce loyalty to his community, made him particularly vulnerable to
the virus and to premature death. When his friend, the local dentist,
got COVID-19 and requested a home visit, Uncle Gerald
went---maskless---without a second thought. When he contracted the virus
and developed symptoms, he chose to treat himself at home rather than go
to the hospital, and the first treatment he tried was
hydroxychloroquine. By the time he finally allowed my aunt to drive him
to the hospital, he could barely breathe.

I often wonder what might have happened to my family if we had
encountered a different form of solidarity in the wake of internment,
one that was not so closely tethered to the American Dream. Would Uncle
Gerald have lived a longer life? Could he have been a participant in the
Black Lives Matter movement, rather than a skeptical onlooker, afraid of
identifying too closely with what he called "victim mentality"? What
kind of an organization might allow my family to identify racial
capitalism as the root cause of our internment and my uncle's premature
death, and to find common cause with others who have an interest in
transforming that system? Perhaps another answer to Henry's question is
that I organize because the same shit that killed George Floyd killed my
Uncle Gerald, however more softly and however more self-inflicted, and
because I, too, want my family to survive.

The vision of togetherness animating Mormonism is one of permanent
unity---the formation of an "eternal family," whose persistence depends
on rigid hierarchies, the suppression of internal conflict, and the
exclusion of those who might threaten the group's stability. In this
respect, Mormonism resembles what political theorist Nathan DuFord, in
their recent book Solidarity in Conflict (2022), calls "antisocial
solidarity": forms of solidarity that ultimately undermine the necessary
conditions for common life by cultivating domination and exclusion.

What does it look like to organize without aspiring to unity or
permanence? DuFord argues that [solidarity]{.underline}, when it is
democratic, [is **always** premised on **disunity**]{.underline},
[because conflict]{.underline} within solidarity organizations [serves
as a **crucial check** on domination and exclusion]{.underline}. On this
point, DuFord articulates a version of the paradox of divergent
interests: "Often, solidarity organizations reproduce the exclusions and
injustices from the situation in which they are formed. This is not a
condemnation, but simply evidence that these organizations do not exist
outside the material context in which they are formed." Given this
reality, the only way to make such organizations less exclusive is for
members to agitate for change from within.

While we tend to associate neoliberalism with individualism and,
therefore, with selfishness and conflict over scarce resources, DuFord
shows that [neoliberalism actually tends to produce]{.underline} a
certain sort of **[consensus]{.underline}**. [Good neoliberal subjects
assume **agreement**]{.underline} about existing economic and political
arrangements [and leave each other **alone**]{.underline}, [rather than
**confronting** each other and trying to **change each other's
minds**]{.underline}. In this way, [neoliberal society tends to drive us
**apart**]{.underline}. By contrast, DuFord suggests that conflict
within solidarity organizations transforms the neoliberal subject into
"a member of a society." For DuFord, internal conflict takes "what was
initially an individual goal a person perhaps thought many others
shared, and transforms the goal, the person, and that person's norms."
[Through **conflict**]{.underline}, [our understandings of our own
interests and the world we want to build can **change**]{.underline}. At
the same time, [we can become **more knowledgeable**]{.underline},
**[less dominating]{.underline}**, **[less judgmental]{.underline}**,
[and **more generous** in our interpretations of one
another]{.underline}---in a word, more cooperative.

Of course, even if conflict can be productively transformative, it
doesn't always have that effect. [Many conflicts simply make people
never want to go to another meeting again]{.underline}. If
[one]{.underline} product of neoliberalism is consensus, another seems
to be a particular [style of conflict]{.underline}: one that
**[atomizes]{.underline}**, [rather than **transforms**]{.underline},
[the people involved]{.underline}.

Recognizing this fact, DuFord attempts to distinguish between
constructive and destructive conflict. Following sociologists Lewis
Coser and George Simmel, DuFord identifies the former sort of conflict
with "realistic" disagreements, in the sense that "something real is at
stake"---strategic or "substantive" issues that are "generated in the
course of advancing a constitutive aim." As an example, we might think
of ongoing conflicts within the Democratic Socialists of America over
how socialists ought to engage in electoral politics. By contrast,
"unrealistic conflict" is "generated for the purely psychological
satisfaction of a fight"---it arises from "incompatible personalities or
petty quarrels" and "lacks any true goal." This distinction may be
plausible in principle, but it is less plausible in practice. Often what
seem like strategic disagreements are also personality-based conflicts.
Moreover, the latter can be constructive if we accept that our
personalities are shaped by our experiences of the social world and
allow even these types of disputes to work on us.

[A more promising way to facilitate solidarity]{.underline} through
conflict [might be to think about]{.underline} the norms and practices
that cultivate **[endurance]{.underline}**. [No conflict is productive
without a social context that **holds people together long enough** that
they have to try to **understand** where the other person is coming
from]{.underline}. [If we don't have to stay in the room
**together**]{.underline}, [we have **no reason** to do the difficult
work of identifying the **roots** of our disagreement]{.underline},
[considering the ways our experiences]{.underline} of privilege or
oppression [might be **shaping our perspective**]{.underline}, [and
exercising our judgment to **resolve the dispute**]{.underline}. [The
crucial question]{.underline}, then, [is not how to **categorize**
conflict as good or bad]{.underline}, [but how to cultivate the capacity
to **show up** when you **don't know** what kind of a fight it's going
to be]{.underline}.

What's missing from DuFord's account, in other words, is the temporal
dimension of solidarity. DuFord sometimes seems to suggest that
stability is irrelevant to the question of how constructive conflict can
be. They write, "These \[internal\] conflicts do threaten the groups'
stability, but solidarity organizations are not intended to be permanent
political institutions." Solidarity organizations are not meant to exist
forever, and the attempt to make them do so produces perverse results.
"Solidarity Forever" is a dangerous promise and a recipe for exclusion
and domination. But solidarity [organizations]{.underline} do [have to
**endure**]{.underline} for a while. [The challenge is to figure out how
to stick together long enough for conflict to **effect change** in the
people involved]{.underline}, [and in the world]{.underline}.

In this regard, Mormons have something that [most neoliberal subjects
lack]{.underline}---**[social endurance]{.underline}**, or [the capacity
to **keep showing up** even when doing so is unpleasant]{.underline}.
Growing up Mormon in the Boston area, I learned how to show up to three
hours of meetings on Sundays, two hours of youth group on Wednesday
night, and an hour of scripture study before school every morning that I
didn't sleep through my alarm, all with people who I mostly did not
like. Over time [I came to value the **frustration** I experienced
in]{.underline} these [meetings]{.underline}. Church was the one place
in my life where I regularly interacted [with people who were **very
different** from me]{.underline}. My friends at school were all
upper-middle class, Ivy League--bound, secular, and liberal. My brothers
and sisters at church were from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Some
were recent immigrants. Many were ideologically right-wing. [Most
believed things that I found **deeply implausible**]{.underline}. [The
process of learning to work with these people]{.underline} to do mutual
aid and organize our congregation [forced me out of myself]{.underline}
in ways that I found difficult to leave.

It should be easier to leave a democratic solidarity organization than
it was for me to leave Mormonism. But [some degree of social endurance
is **essential** to both personal and social
transformation]{.underline}, given how difficult it is to hold subjects
of neoliberalism together for any length of time.

[To cultivate social endurance is to enter every collective in
anticipation of **annoyance** and **heartbreak**]{.underline}. [We are
going to **irritate** and **disappoint** each other]{.underline},
despite our best intentions. Given the ways our society is segregated by
race, class, and other demographic categories, [we almost certainly will
find things to **dislike** when we get together]{.underline}, even if
only [because we **don't know how to act** around each
other]{.underline}. We might even think our comrades are stupid
motherfuckers, which---let's be honest---they often are. Fortunately, as
Dean argues, one of the distinctive features of comradeship is that [we
don't have to **like** the people with whom we are in
solidarity]{.underline}. Maybe [political relationships work best when
we **don't like each other**]{.underline}, [and when we express
our]{.underline} frustrations, [disagreements]{.underline}, and anger
[with the intent of moving toward a **shared goal**]{.underline}.

### Link---Decolonial Thought---1NC/2NC

#### Decolonial epistemologies [naively]{.underline} assume that epistemologies can be decolonized without [material structures]{.underline} changing---that [obscures]{.underline} political economy and [facilitates]{.underline} capital expansion.

**Kapoor, 24**---professor of Critical Development Studies at the
Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University (Ilan,
"Intersectionality, Decoloniality, Indigenous Localism: A Critique,"
Theory, Culture & Society, OnlineFirst, doi:10.1177/02632764241303689,
dml)

There is much to learn from decoloniality -- from its multi-dimensional
analysis of coloniality, to its [[critique of Western modernity]{.mark}
and its]{.underline} prescriptions for decolonizing the colonial matrix.
But Mignolo's [analysis [inclines toward **romanticizing** decolonial
spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has almost nothing critical to say about
the subaltern/Global South; it is [as though they are **somehow immune**
to contradiction]{.underline}, [failure]{.underline}, [or
disagreement]{.underline} (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 96--9).

[This is evident in]{.underline} Mignolo's reliance on
[**[simplified]{.mark}** and **intransigent [binaries]{.mark}** such
as]{.underline} when he pits **[Western]{.underline}** 'imperial'
[universalism against **decolonial** pluriversality]{.underline}, which
for him is invariably 'convivial, dialogical, or plurilogical . . .
decolonial and communal personalities are driven by the search for love,
conviviality, and harmony' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv; see also Mignolo,
2011: 313). It is also evident in the work of the
Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality [research]{.underline} programme, a
collective Latin America-focused research project of
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} both Mignolo and Arturo Escobar are part.
The project [[prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[non-Eurocentric]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[forms]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}/knowledge rooted in such communities as the
Zapatistas in Mexico, Indigenous groups in Ecuador and Bolivia, and
Afro-Latinx movements in Colombia (Asher, 2013: 838; see also Escobar,
2020: 84--96, 120--35; Mignolo, 2011: 11, 213--51). Yet when Mignolo
applauds, for example, the Zapatistas for their participatory politics
and collective consensus-making, he appears to ignore that
consensus-based politics can coerce single decisions on communities,
often suppressing subaltern voices (Kapoor, 2008: 107--8, 2020: 147--69;
see Rancière, 1999). When Mignolo praises Indigenous communities, he
**[[ignores]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, [the [**cooptation**
of Indigenous leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} by the Ecuadorean state, the
Morales regime's [[**backtracking** on]{.mark} commitments to
[Indigenous self-determination]{.mark} to appease capitalist
extraction]{.underline}, [**[ideological divisions]{.mark}** between and
among Indigenous groups]{.underline} across North, South, and Central
America, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the anti-Muslim politics of sections
of adivasi (Aboriginal) communities in India in [[**collaboration** with
right-wing]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu
[[supremacists]{.underline}]{.mark}: 'What is **[absent]{.underline}**
in Mignolo's representations of the subaltern [are]{.underline} the
[warnings]{.underline} by the likes of Freire and Fanon [about the
possibility of internalized subaltern oppression]{.underline},
[racism]{.underline}, [and co-optation]{.underline} (which is ironic,
given that Fanon is one of Mignolo's key decolonial exemplars)' (Kapoor
and Zalloua, 2022: 96; see also Baviskar, 2007; Merino, 2016).

The extent of such an indiscriminate politics of
authenticity/romanticization is to be gleaned in Mignolo's recent
endorsement of a book from a right-wing Hindu author (Deepak, 2021) who
deploys decolonial arguments to make the case for a return to a Hindu
(Brahmanical) epistemology. After a public outcry, Mignolo eventually
withdrew his endorsement,8 but his [[willingness to **uncritically
embrace** a]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu nationalist [[politics]{.mark}
just [because it is **disparaging of Western
epistemology**]{.mark}]{.underline} and aims at retrieving an
'Indigenous' Hindu cosmology [is revealing of the decolonial tendency to
embrace putatively]{.underline} '**[authentic]{.underline}**' [Global
South spaces even if they are **elitist** or
**oppressive**]{.underline}.

What is conspicuously missing in Mignolo's decolonial position is the
dimension of the Real, the imminent blockage that prevents any
discursive formation -- whether capitalist, post-capitalist, or
pluriversal -- from actualizing its identity. As Crenshaw does with
intersectional identity, Mignolo appears to so revel in the jouissance
of the subaltern/Global South space that he is blind to -- disavows --
social contradictions. Hence his resort to an authentic pluriversality
devoid of imperfections: a space where, as Michaelsen and Shershow
(2007) underline in their analysis of his work (p. 53), there is de
facto consensus and agreement, indeed not even the need to criticize,
debate, or deliberate. [This [appears as]{.mark} the **[textbook]{.mark}
definition of [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [the **erasure** of
the political]{.underline}, the covering over of social antagonism
(Žižek, 1989: 25).

The accompanying proclivity is that [the production of an authentic
Global South subaltern space ends up **militating against** the putative
political subject of decoloniality]{.underline} -- [the
subaltern]{.underline}. In this regard, echoing Spivak (1988), Asher
(2013: 838--9) suggests that Mignolo and his decoloniality peers are
'turning to subaltern knowledge to fulfill \[their\] desire to create a
just world for humans and non-humans'. Decolonial jouissance of the
pluriverse induces the absence of critical self-reflexivity on the part
of the decolonial analyst, with the latter portraying himself as
transparent relay able to accurately capture the subaltern voice. The
search for a subaltern pluriverse thus becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy: you project a pluriversal platform on the subaltern and then
rejoice in miraculously finding it! But in this mêlée, the subaltern is
not heard (which is why my above critique of Zapatista participatory
politics says less about the Zapatistas than Mignolo's construction of
them).

Mignolo's [Manichaean [argumentation]{.mark} also tends to be **broadly
dismissive** of Western thought]{.underline}, [accusing it of complicity
in the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}, [thus appealing for it to
be superseded]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2002: 80, 2010: 346). He seems [to
[**conflate** hegemonic European]{.mark}]{.underline}
([colonial]{.underline}) [[thought with European thought writ
large]{.underline}]{.mark}. In so doing, he [**[fails to
acknowledge]{.mark}** the many [European]{.mark} intellectual
**[counter-discourses]{.mark}** to colonial rationality or binary
thinking]{.underline} (anti-imperialism, non-dualism, communitarianism,
etc.) [with [which]{.mark}]{.underline}, for all intents and purposes,
[much of [decolonial thought is **allied**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
fails as well to account for his own debt to so-called Eurocentrism,
disavowing that his intellectual background, as well as the very
language (English) and critical tools he deploys (e.g. geopolitics,
difference, epistemology, gnoseology, aesthesis), are unavoidably
Eurocentric (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 99--100). Worse still, his
[policing of the boundaries of what is]{.underline}
'**[Western]{.underline}**'/'non-Western' [ends up **eliding** the
centuries-old cultural and economic exchange between Europe and its
putative others]{.underline} (Africa, the Arab world, Indigenous
America, the Indian subcontinent, etc.); [or indeed the **substantial
history** of subaltern resistance]{.underline} -- [in Europe's
colonies]{.underline}, [and in Europe itself]{.underline} -- [that is
**integral** to the emergence of such notions as]{.underline}
'equality', '**[freedom]{.underline}**', and 'social justice' (see, for
example, Anghie, 2005; Buck-Morss, 2009; Cusicanqui, 2012).

Thus, Mignolo's [decolonial disavowal]{.underline} of the
unconscious/Real [is]{.underline} not only deeply ideological for
romanticizing subaltern pluriversality, but also **[deeply
depoliticizing]{.underline}**. Rather than seeing internal (community or
social movement) differences and contradictions as weaknesses/traumas to
be suppressed or avoided in order to produce a perfect subaltern 'hero',
why not try to face them head-on to invent new and creative (although
never harmonious) subaltern political spaces? [Rather than understanding
colonial violence and dispossession as a reason to **nostalgically
manufacture**]{.underline} past or present [glory or wallow
in]{.underline} victimhood and **[resentment]{.underline}** ([against
European thinkers]{.underline}), [[why not]{.mark} struggle to [**become
proficient** with]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and
**use**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[European discourses of emancipation and
freedom]{.mark} to fight for subaltern equality and social justice
everywhere?]{.underline} [[The Western colonial legacy is]{.mark} indeed
[imperialist]{.mark} domination and plunder]{.underline}, [[but it is
**also**]{.underline},]{.mark} as Žižek (2009) underlines, 'that of [the
**[self-critical examination]{.mark}** of the violence and exploitation
the West itself brought to the Third World]{.underline} . . . the West
supplied the very standards by which it (and its critics) measures its
own criminal past' (p. 115). [The [antagonisms of European
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this sense, [[can be]{.mark} viewed as
**[powerful]{.mark} subaltern political
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And such is the case not only for the
subaltern from the Global South, but also for the subaltern from the
Global North: their common predicaments could be the occasion to find
cause together in shared trauma (Kapoor, 2020: xv, 66; Kapoor and
Zalloua, 2022: 20). [This is something that]{.underline} Mignolo's
[demonization of the West **precludes**]{.underline}, failing as it does
to distinguish hegemonic from subaltern (counter-) discourses, whether
in the West or otherwise, thereby further depoliticizing the subaltern.

Finally, there is the issue of [the [exclusion of the
**state**]{.mark}]{.underline} and political economy in Mignolo's gloss.
In regard to the state, Mignolo stands firmly against it, predictably
seeing it as the political expression of (Western) coloniality. For him,
pluriversal spaces would 'exist independently of the state and
corporations' by delinking 'from state forms of governance, from the
economy of accumulation' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv). Thus, 'the future
would be composed of "communal nodes" around the planet cooperating
rather than competing with each other . . . \[through\] the entanglement
of several cosmologies connected today in power differential' (Mignolo,
2011: 283, 2018: x).

But Mignolo's position [[appears]{.mark} politically
**[naive]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Without some]{.underline}]{.mark}
[form of **[coordinating authority]{.mark}** like a state]{.underline},
[it [remains **unclear**]{.mark} [how]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[security and well-being]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'communal nodes'
[[would be realized]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[what would ensure
**cooperation**]{.underline},]{.mark} [rather than
conflict]{.underline}, [[among and between nodes]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially given 'power differential'; [[and how]{.mark} these nodes
would be able [to **thwart** the]{.mark} continuing [incursion
of]{.mark} global [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or threats
from]{.mark} both the [**Western** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
['**[de-Westernized]{.underline}**' [powers]{.underline}]{.mark}
envisaged by Mignolo. It seems, in fact, that his [pluriversal
politics]{.underline} [**unconsciously requires** a]{.underline}
national, regional, and/or transnational [state]{.underline} to ensure
[the [coexistence of]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[many
worlds]{.underline}**']{.mark}. He [[appears to **count** on]{.mark}
such things as [peace enforcement]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.underline}, [provision of [universal education and health
care]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[regulation of
multinationals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[campaigns against]{.mark} global
[viral infections]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and so forth]{.underline}, for
his communal nodes [to **thrive**]{.underline}.

As to **[[political economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, it [[is]{.mark} all
but **[absent]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Mignolo's political viewpoint,
given his pluriversal privileging of epistemological, at the expense of
material, decolonization. He does sketchily mention imperial resource
extraction in his [critique of coloniality]{.underline}, but says almost
nothing about the material dimensions of pluriversality. This is because
(expectedly) he [assesses Marxist political economy as]{.underline}
integral to a '**[Eurocentered]{.underline}** critique' (Mignolo, 2011:
xi, xviii), [**glossing over** the many variants of Third World
Marxisms]{.underline} ([whether Nepalese]{.underline},
[Cuban]{.underline}, [Chinese]{.underline}, [South African]{.underline},
[Peruvian]{.underline}, [Indian]{.underline}, etc., [many of which have
been actualized as political projects]{.underline} with varying degrees
of success/failure, including democratic communism in Kerala and Bengal,
for example). Mignolo (2010) looks instead to 'delinking from
capitalism' epistemologically (p. 339), [[as though decolonized
knowledge production will undo not just]{.mark} **neoliberal
[ideology]{.mark}** [but]{.mark} the **[structures]{.mark}** of global
capitalism]{.underline}. [The **[overwhelming evidence]{.mark}** to date
[points to]{.mark} just [the **opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}: as
mentioned earlier, [the [success of]{.mark} corporate [capitalism
lies]{.mark} in part [in its **co-optation** of]{.mark} the
[epistemological]{.mark}-cultural [claims]{.mark} of social
movements]{.underline} -- [because [not only do they not pose a
**threat** to accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} they [can
also be **commodified** to advance accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is all the more the case with a decolonial politics of authenticity
which, like intersectionality, fixes and essentializes subaltern
culture/identity, thereby enabling its commoditization.

Consequently, given the disavowal of any state-like authority or
meaningful materialist analysis or strategy, Mignolo's decolonial
pluriversality yields to little more than what decolonial Indigenous
scholar Cusicanqui (2012) sees as 'multiculturalism' (p. 104).
Decoloniality may well mount a [critique of the coloniality of
power]{.underline}, but in Mignolo's hands, just as in Crenshaw's, such
critique nonetheless [ends up **facilitating**]{.underline}, **[not
challenging]{.underline}**, [global capitalism]{.underline}.
[Localism]{.underline}/particularism [**nicely suits** capitalism as
much as coloniality]{.underline}, [since it can be **readily
accommodated** if not **commodified**]{.underline}. So as with Crenshaw,
my claim is that Mignolo's disavowal of state/political economy and his
accompanying advocacy of the local amounts to an unconscious acceptance
of capitalist multiculturalism. We are thus left with another case of
'fetishistic disavowal' -- a secret love for the System in spite of an
outwardly biting critique of it. The global capitalist order sets (and
is allowed to set) the boundary for decolonial counterhegemonic
critique.

### Link---Identity---1NC/2NC

#### The 1AC explains [material]{.underline} oppression through an [identitarian]{.underline} lens, which [culturalizes]{.underline} capitalism instead of [dismantling]{.underline} it.

**Kapoor, 24**---professor of Critical Development Studies at the
Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University (Ilan,
"Intersectionality, Decoloniality, Indigenous Localism: A Critique,"
Theory, Culture & Society, OnlineFirst, doi:10.1177/02632764241303689,
dml)

Indeed, identity politics is integral to capitalist liberal
multiculturalism, allowing state and market to recognize and protect
minority group rights. Yet the latter development is revealing of the
very political limitations of liberal rights discourse (Jameson, 1991;
McGowan, 2020): while certainly empowering for social groups and
[focusing public attention on]{.underline} a host of issues created,
ignored, or suppressed by liberal democracies, the problem is that
[identity]{.underline}/multicultural politics, [**far** from effecting
structural changes]{.underline}, [has been **easily
mainstreamed**]{.underline} -- [incorporated into the
System]{.underline}. The reason is that [[cultural recognition poses
**little threat** to]{.mark} [capital]{.mark}ist
multiculturalism]{.underline}: the state's granting of minority rights
or the business sector's [recognition of]{.underline} group [identities
requires **no meaningful systemic changes**]{.underline}. On the
contrary, [[the corporate]{.mark} sector]{.underline}, for example,
[[has been]{.mark} **only too [happy]{.mark}** [to capitalize
on]{.mark}]{.underline} [']{.mark}**[cultural
capitalism]{.underline}**', niche marketing products to multicultural
groups, while 'proudly' sponsoring such events as Earth Day, Women's
Marches, Black History Month, or Gay Pride. [The political
weakness]{.underline} of identity politics [lies]{.underline}, in other
words, [in its tendency to **too narrowly** focus on identity
issues]{.underline}, [at the expense of **broader** and **more
collective** material and socioeconomic rights]{.underline} (land
rights, the protection of the environmental commons, socioeconomic
equality, etc.; more on that below).

[Implied in this]{.underline} '[[**culturalization** of
politics]{.underline}']{.mark} [is the **positivization** of
identity]{.underline} -- [essentializing it]{.underline}, [fixing its
parameters]{.underline} -- [[which]{.mark} is what allows
the]{.underline} liberal [state and]{.underline} corporate [capitalism
to anesthetize it]{.underline}, [domesticate it]{.underline},
[commoditize it]{.underline}. And [such positivization]{.underline} is
reflected in intersectionality, revealing of its compliance with a
liberal multicultural framework. Accordingly, Carastathis (2008: 25--6,
2016: 125--62) [[analyzes]{.underline}]{.mark} Crenshaw's [[subjects
as]{.mark} always already]{.underline}
'[**[having]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[identities]{.underline}]{.mark},
[on the basis of which their marginalization occurs]{.underline}:
'political marginalization follows . . . the formation of the identity
of the hyper-oppressed subject, who by virtue of her identity is
politically marginalized. Intersectional subjects come, so to speak,
already formed to the space of political contestation'.3 It is not the
negative space of the intersection that is upheld, since negativity
would be difficult to fix, accommodate, or commodify, thus threatening
the mobility of global capital. [What is countenanced]{.underline} by
intersectionality instead [is the **positivization** of
identity]{.underline}, [something the System **welcomes** for its
stability]{.underline}, [recognizability]{.underline}, [and
commodifiability]{.underline}. It is because [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
hyphenated [[subject]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.
female-Black-disabled-queer) [[is **identifiable**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[because multiple subject-positions can be **integrated** into the
System]{.underline} -- [indeed [can help **advance** the System since
the more subject-positions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the more
opportunities for **commodification** and **product
differentiation**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- that intersectionality's
critical stance ultimately conforms with, and helps reproduce,
capitalist multicultural politics.

Further evidence of [such conformism]{.underline} is that intersectional
analysis [is now **integral** to mainstream]{.underline} -- including
private sector -- equity, diversity, and inclusion
(**[EDI]{.underline}**) [strategies]{.underline} (Ahmed, 2007; Mounk,
2023), [most often aimed at enhancing organizational
performance]{.underline}. Intersectional EDI training helps employees
acknowledge their implicit biases against the diversity of identities
and human experiences so as to improve hiring practices and ensure
inclusive workplaces. [It [tends to be
**agent-focused**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [only [addressing]{.mark}
questions of [oppression]{.mark}]{.underline} (misogyny, homophobia,
racism, ableism, etc.) [[at the level of the
**individual**]{.underline}]{.mark} employee or to the extent that they
help advance organizational inclusion, effectiveness, and profit-making,
[as opposed to tackling **broader social systems** of
oppression]{.underline}. In fact, the more intersectional and
multidimensional the organization's EDI strategy, the more it can
promote its brand as equitable and diverse (even if it does not
necessarily live up to such a claim). [This is not]{.underline} to
suggest that intersectionality is [inherently corporate]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} to point out that [its tendency to culturalize and
positivize identity]{.underline}, despite -- and because -- of its
multi-dimensionality, [leaves it **too easily open** to]{.underline}
domestication, **[commodification]{.underline}**, corporate branding.

Psychoanalysis adds another significant dimension here: the reason why
intersectional identity politics appeals in today's multicultural world
is because of the subject's enjoyment (jouissance) of it -- enjoyment in
Lacanese denoting the excessive pleasure derived from something to the
point of irrationality (Lacan, 1998: 183--4).4 Accordingly, under a
multicultural regime, [the subject is **seduced** by the prospect of
social and political recognition and recovery]{.underline} (Thakur,
2020: xx--xxi; Žižek, 2006: 309). Intersectionality's [[**libidinal
reward** can be seen in]{.mark} a range of current socio-political
occurrences]{.underline}: [the]{.underline} (liberal) [benevolence
of]{.underline} granting rights and [[**rescuing** and
**rehabilitating** oppressed voices]{.underline}]{.mark}; [the
corresponding thrill of [being **recognized**]{.mark}]{.underline} by
claiming identity [or]{.underline} minority rights; the
self-righteousness of [**asserting** one's oppression]{.underline} and
'victimhood'; [[and]{.mark}/or the narcissism of
**[acknowledging]{.mark}** one's personal [guilt and
complicity]{.mark}]{.underline} in social injustices. Of particular note
is 'privilege theory' (Applebaum, 2011; Kimmel and Ferber, 2016), which,
while [bringing attention to privileged subject positions and
complicity]{.underline} in homophobia, patriarchy, or racism,
[[can]{.mark} sometimes [create]{.mark} an atmosphere of
[**surveillance** and **disciplining**]{.mark}]{.underline} ('privilege
checking') [of both self and other]{.underline}. As Zalloua (2020)
notes, [there is]{.underline} 'a kind of illicit satisfaction -- an
unconscious enjoyment -- not only in exposing the blind spots \[and\] .
. . rhetorical disciplining of others, but in your own self-discipline,
in your perceived suffering. . . . At its base level, privilege theory
provides you with [[the fantasy of]{.mark} intervention and
action]{.underline}; [it offers]{.underline} you
**[[criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (attention to subjective violence)
[[without **critique**]{.underline}]{.mark} (occluding objective \[i.e.
systemic\] violence)' (pp. 36, 18). [So invested can people become in
identity]{.underline} (their own and that of others) [that they [can get
**bogged down** in battles over **recognition** and
**self-policing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The libidinal complement to intersectional identity politics thus
reinforces the culturalization of liberal democratic politics. [Real
social problems]{.underline} (discrimination, marginalization,
racialization, inequality) [are pressingly raised]{.underline}, [but
only **superficially** or **partially** acted upon]{.underline}.
[[People enjoy and publicize]{.mark} their critical
[self-awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}, [their [empathy]{.mark} with the
oppressed]{.underline}, [and their seemingly progressive]{.underline}
and humanitarian [politics]{.underline}, [but **[without]{.mark} taking
any [meaningful action]{.mark}**]{.underline} (confronting the systemic
barriers to inequalities, or demanding collective and material rights,
not simply individual civil and cultural rights). [[We feel good about
**naming**]{.mark} **our [complicity]{.mark}**]{.underline} in global
inequality, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} we get off on [[**surveilling**
others']{.mark} lack of]{.underline} '**[political
correctness]{.underline}**', [but this only ends up [**reinforcing**
the]{.mark} particularity]{.underline},
[[fragmentation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and depoliticization tha[t
capital]{.mark}ist liberal democracies [count on]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But intersectionality's [most significant]{.underline} blind spot
[is]{.underline} its [**disavowal** of political economy]{.underline}.
Class as socioeconomic category, in particular, is all but absent in
Crenshaw's piece, as evidenced for example by the following statement:
'theories and strategies purporting to reflect the Black community's
needs must include an analysis of sexism and patriarchy. Similarly,
feminism must include an analysis of race if it hopes to express the
aspirations of non-white women' (Crenshaw, 1989: 166). Consistent with
her identity-focused claims, in the few spots that Crenshaw broaches
class, she does so as part of a series of categories -- e.g. 'race, sex,
class, sexual preference, age, and/or physical ability' (p. 151),5
thereby taking class as an identity (i.e. the identity of 'privileged
white women' or 'working-class Black women'). But [equating class with
identity **culturalizes** the term]{.underline}, [**reducing** the
problem of social oppression]{.underline} once again [to questions of
diversity and inclusion]{.underline}. [It **flattens** socioeconomic
inequalities]{.underline}, [implying the latter are simply a problem of
difference]{.underline}, so that, for instance, by recognizing and
including working-class Black women in the social field, they will
somehow be on a level playing field with 'privileged white women'.

Marx's (1847) insistence on class as a socioeconomic category (p. 195)
is meant precisely to bring out the socioeconomic inequality on which
the capitalist system is founded, and the resulting sociopolitical
antagonism that follows (as intimated by his notion of 'class
struggle'). By [focusing on]{.underline} social diversity and identity
[**recognition** to give voice to the marginalized]{.underline},
intersectionality [ends up **smoothing over** this key
antagonism]{.underline}, thereby [**covering over**
capitalism's]{.underline} '**[dirty secret]{.underline}**'
(exploitation, domination, socio-material hierarchies). As Foley (2019)
points out, the 'fact that the black women in question \[in Crenshaw's
article\] are workers who earn at best modest wages, but make the bosses
of GM very rich, is simply taken as a given . . . \[Crenshaw's\] model
for analysis and compensation \[is\] confined to the limits of the law'
(p. 11). [[Choosing **cultural** explanations to oppression over
**material** ones]{.underline}]{.mark}, investing in liberal civil
rights discourse to address socioeconomic wrongs, [ends up
[treat]{.mark}ing the [**symptom** as]{.mark} the
**[cause]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Foley perspicaciously points out in
this regard that [[it is not]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[race]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[that causes
racism]{.underline},]{.mark} [[or]{.underline}
'**[gender]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[that results in
misogyny]{.underline}]{.mark} (p. 11); rather, [race and gender are
[categories of **social differentiation**]{.mark} invented]{.underline}
at the dawn of capitalism [to [justify]{.mark} the exploitation and
[domination of labour]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lugones, 2016; Quijano,
2000; Robinson, 2019). By [[**omitting** this]{.mark}
historical-structuralist dimension]{.underline}, intersectionality
[[misses the **material roots** of]{.mark} marginalization and
[oppression]{.mark}]{.underline} (Aguilar, 2015; Foley, 2019). In this
regard, what Crenshaw's crossroads metaphor ignores is that the
velocity/power of some vehicles (i.e. representing class, revealingly
absent in her example) is more impactful than others. So [without
attending to socioeconomic inequalities]{.underline}, [it is
**difficult** to see how patriarchy and racism]{.underline}
([or]{.underline} indeed [homophobia and ableism]{.underline}) [can be
**meaningfully abated**]{.underline}, as indeed they haven't despite
(and dare I say it, because of) decades of liberal rights recognition
around the world (Fraser and Honneth, 2003).6

### Link---Oppositional Scholarship---1NC/2NC

#### The 1AC's focus on oppositional scholarship enables [neoliberal capture]{.underline} of the academy.

**Okoth, 23**---member of the Salvage editorial collective (Kevin
Ochieng, "Decolonisation and the Decline of the 'Bandung Spirit'," *Red
Africa: Reclaiming Revolutionary Black Politics*, Chapter 1, pp. 16-20,
dml)

[The recent [focus on **epistemic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**symbolic**
or **cultural** [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} of decolonisation can
largely be attributed to the Decolonial Studies (DS) school spearheaded
by the Argentinian linguist Walter Mignolo, which [has
[re-conceptualised decolonisation as]{.mark} a **[purely
academic]{.mark}** and **intellectual** issue]{.underline}. While the
discourse encompasses multiple strands of writing on colonialism and
epistemology, DS [scholars share a common set of theoretical
positions]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} Enrique Dussel's
anti-universalism, Mignolo's geopolitics of knowledge, Immanuel
Wallerstein's world- systems theory, and Sandra Harding's standpoint
theory, [an epistemic [approach]{.mark} which [argues that research must
**begin** with]{.mark} the perspectives of [the **most
oppressed**]{.mark} and **marginalised**]{.underline}, [since they are
socially situated in a way that gives them an advantage in gaining
certain forms of knowledge]{.underline}. Most importantly, however, DS
builds on the concept of the coloniality of power first articulated by
Aníbal Quijano to describe a 'matrix of power that produces racial and
gender hierarchies on the global and local level, functioning alongside
capital to maintain a modern regime of exploitation and domination'.17

For Quijano, coloniality is a mode of power that has its roots in two
historical processes: the codification of difference (i.e., superiority/
inferiority) in the idea of race, and the establishment of new modes of
control which made labour and resources available for capitalist
accumulation. Such formulations are, of course, nothing new. But it is
Quijano's linking of modernity and coloniality in a singular matrix that
constitutes his major contribution. What this matrix enables us to see
is that coloniality is the other -- dark -- side of modernity, the
inevitable outcome of an epistemological frame that enables the colonial
project to survive in reconstituted forms. Mignolo and other DS scholars
supposedly offer a way out of the oppressive bind of Quijano's
modernity/coloniality matrix. As Mignolo explains in On Decoloniality:

If there is no modernity without coloniality, if coloniality is
constitutive of modernity, if the '/' \[in the triad
modernity/coloniality/decoloniality\] divides and connects, then
decoloniality proposes the undoing of modernity. That is, decoloniality
implies demodernity. At the same time, modernity/coloniality engender
decoloniality. So there would be no decoloniality -- and decoloniality
would not be necessary -- if modernity/ coloniality had not created the
need to delink from the rhetoric of modernity and the logic of
coloniality.18

DS proposes new ways of 'thinking, sensing, believing, doing, and
living' that delink from the Eurocentric knowledge production of
modernity. Its aim, then, is to enable a reconstitution of knowledge
based on 'epistemic pluriversality': the coexisting epistemologies and
practices of the multiple worlds that the cultural and linguistic Other
inhabits. In doing so, they are pushing back against modernity, which
relies on a philosophical anthropology that, to borrow a phrase from
Sylvia Wynter, overrepresents European man as if it were the Human
itself, and subjugates those who have been categorised as subhuman
according to colonial logics.

[There is a **tension** between the **emancipatory aims**]{.underline}
to which DS pledges allegiance, [the **theoretical
framework**]{.underline} it proposes, [and its proponents'
**positionality** in the international]{.underline} ([and
intellectual]{.underline}) [division of labour]{.underline}. [What are
the implications for anti-imperialist struggle in the global south if
[those at the **forefront** of challenging]{.mark} the Eurocentricity of
[knowledge]{.mark} production [are based in]{.mark} the
**[resource-hoarding universities]{.mark}** of the global
north]{.underline} (and especially in the United States)[?]{.underline}
[Is there not a **[danger]{.mark}** here [of
**reproducing**]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely the kind of **[[epistemic
coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}** from which we are trying to
delink[?]{.underline} And [what are we to make of]{.underline} DS'
[reliance on a **[deferential]{.mark}** version of standpoint
theory]{.underline}, [whose **[narrow focus]{.mark}** on]{.underline}
'[spokespeople from marginalised groups]{.underline}' [could
[**prevent** us from centring those voices]{.mark} whose exclusion DS
claims to be fighting against?]{.underline} As Olúfémí O. Táíwò
explains, 'The concept of elite capture originated in the study of
developing countries to describe the way socially advantaged people tend
to gain control over financial benefits, especially foreign aid, meant
for others'. But '[**[elite capture]{.underline}**'
[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also be used to [describe]{.underline} '[how
political projects can be **hijacked** in **principle** or in **effect**
by the well positioned and resourced]{.underline}'.19 There is, perhaps,
an analogy to be made between certain types of [scholars in the
neoliberal university]{.underline} and the neo-colonial elites; both
[**[enable]{.mark}** the **reproduction** of a system that ensures the
**[continued exploitation]{.mark}** of the very people they claim to
represent]{.underline}.

Táíwò is not [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} only one concerned with elite
capture. In 'Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of
Decolonisation', a forcefully argued critique of DS, the Bolivian
Anarcho-feminist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui takes aim at a Latin American

[[intelligentsia]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[strikes]{.mark}
**post-modern** and]{.underline} even **[[post-colonial
poses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and to the US academy and its followers
who built pyramidal structures of power and symbolic capital -- baseless
pyramids that vertically blind certain Latin American universities --
[[and]{.mark} form **clientelist networks** with indigenous and black
intellectuals]{.underline}.20

[These intellectuals]{.underline}, she argues, [[reproduce]{.mark}
a]{.underline} '[**[conditional inclusion]{.underline}**']{.mark} -- a
sort of 'second-class citizenship [[that moulds subaltern]{.mark}
imaginaries and [identities into]{.mark} the role of
**[ornaments]{.mark}** through which the anonymous masses play out the
theatricality of their own identity]{.underline}'. By reducing
Indigenous peoples to the marginal status of minorities, 'noble savages'
or 'guardians of nature', scholars like Mignolo and Catherine Walsh
[effectively]{.underline} exclude them from modernity and the crucial
struggles that are waged within it. Cusicanqui accuses Mignolo of
[[building]{.mark} a]{.underline} '**[small [empire within an
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark} -- a formation that perpetuates
coloniality in Latin America [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[enthroning]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[decolonisation in the
academy]{.underline}]{.mark}.21 Through [the **appropriation** and
**depoliticisation** of]{.underline} the work of [radical]{.underline}
Indigenous [scholarship]{.underline}, like that of Cusicanqui herself,
Mignolo [**marginalises** these scholars and activists from the very
debates that they themselves started and are still engaged
in]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [**limits** the
**imaginative power** and **emancipatory potential** of their
discourse]{.underline} on 'decolonisation'.

Decolonial Studies' concept of delinking does not correspond to the
Bandung-era demand, elaborated theoretically by Amin, that nations in
the global south should economically and politically delink from
imperialism. Rather, [delinking]{.underline} here [takes place
exclusively on an epistemic level]{.underline}. This is because, Mignolo
and his frequent collaborator Walsh argue, decoloniality delinks from
the knowledge of political theory, political economy and the
corresponding subject formation these knowledges entail.22 DS makes a
sharp distinction between colonialism as it is commonly understood and
the more abstract phenomenon of coloniality. While colonialism simply
refers to a political and economic relation in which 'the sovereignty of
a nation or a people rests on the power of another nation', coloniality
refers instead to the underlying 'patterns of power' -- in the spheres
of knowledge production or culture, for example -- that have survived
beyond the official end of colonial domination.23 For Mignolo and Walsh,
the national liberation movements of the Bandung era were engaged in
'dewesternisation'; that is, they were simply trying to fight
coloniality on its own terms (those of the nation-state), thus failing
to challenge the 'epistemic empire' that colonialism created.
Decoloniality, on the other hand, is not a state-led project, but
emerges from 'people organizing themselves in their local histories'.24
Theirs, they argue, is the only true decolonising praxis.

In her 1993 essay 'Public Enemies and Private Intellectuals', Ruth
Wilson [Gilmore takes issue with]{.underline} three approaches to
scholarship that have shaped how marginalised academics present
themselves in the neoliberal university. Gilmore groups these approaches
together under the banner of '[**[oppositional
studies]{.underline}**']{.mark}, which includes overlapping approaches
such as 'individual careerism', 'romantic particularism' and 'luxury
production'. [She defines **romantic particularism** as the tendency to
**uncritically [celebrate]{.mark}** the essential]{.underline}
'[**[authenticity]{.underline}**']{.mark} [of epistemologies and
cultures that have been suppressed]{.underline} by colonialism and
imperialism. **[Luxury production]{.underline}**, on the other hand,
[refers to the **relatively comfortable site**]{.underline} (i.e., [the
university]{.underline}) [from which these scholars produce]{.underline}
'oppositional' knowledge. For Gilmore, the final tendency, **[individual
careerism]{.underline}**, '[assigns **primary importance** to the
fact]{.underline} -- [and survival]{.underline} -- [of oppositional
studies within the intellectual and social structures of the
university]{.underline}'.25 To this end, [[scholars become **obsessed**
wit]{.mark}h the idea of [being]{.mark} the **first to coin** a
theoretical concept or [the **most knowledgeable**]{.mark} about a new
oppositional object]{.underline} -- [a performance]{.underline}, [text
or theory]{.underline}, for example. All three [tendencies [lead]{.mark}
oppositional scholars [to **distance themselves** from]{.mark} broader
social [struggles]{.mark} taking place outside of the
university]{.underline}, [[while they]{.mark} continue to **[derive
their]{.mark} academic [credibility]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a close
identification with precisely [these]{.mark} struggles]{.underline}.

## Elite Capture Core

### K---1NC

#### Their method falls prey to [elite capture]{.underline} by prioritizing [theoretical cohesion]{.underline} over [diverse coalitional organizing]{.underline} against imperial structures.

**Táíwò, 22**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, "Introduction," *Elite Capture: How the Powerful
Took Over Identity Politics (and Everything Else)*, Introduction, 14-16,
dml)

Nigeria's Special Anti-robbery Squad, US police forces, and
[many]{.underline} other [[repressive bodies use **similar**
]{.mark}**ideological [structures]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **strategies of
[violence]{.mark}** because they are similar kinds of
institutions]{.underline}, [created to achieve similar
aims]{.underline}. Most of these forces have their roots in the colonial
era of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when national-level
institutions functioned like franchises under the global racial empire's
logo, each territorial army, colonial government, and national stock
exchange linked together in a powerful cartel. [While individual
security forces were dedicated to different national interests under the
**[global racial empire]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the cartel as a whole
served the interests of the **same elites**]{.underline}, [making sure
wealth and advantage flowed **south to north**]{.underline}, **[Black to
white]{.underline}**. [That system [has **never been
dismantled**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So, [while]{.underline}
"**[empire]{.underline}**" [is no longer a popular term]{.underline} in
global politics, [we're **still**]{.underline} basically **[living
it]{.underline}**: [nakedly imperial structures **live on**]{.underline}
in forms like France's management of currencies of many of its former
African colonies, and seemingly neutral international corporations and
institutions bully the poorer peoples and countries of the world in
"neocolonial" fashion.10

So, despite differences in local context, when people around the world
rose up against the police terror and violence to which they have been
subjected for hundreds of years, it was immediately clear that something
global was at stake. The response from governing elites was equally
immediate: the World Bank established a "Task Force on Racism," and the
United Nations, under pressure from the entire African Union bloc of
fifty-four countries, agreed to launch a yearlong inquiry into
anti-Black racism.11 Two [[strategic trends]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
response [**quickly** [became clear]{.mark}]{.underline}: [the
[elites']{.mark} tactic of [performing **symbolic identity
politics**]{.mark} to pacify protestors **[without]{.mark} enacting
[material reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[and]{.mark} their [efforts
to **rebrand**]{.mark}]{.underline} (**[[not
replace]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [existing
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, also using elements of identity
politics.

In a stunningly clear summary of the first trend, the mayor of
Washington, DC, had "Black Lives Matter" painted on streets near the
White House, atop which protestors continued to be brutalized. The
following year, the Central Intelligence Agency rolled out the second
strategy, producing a dozen "Humans of CIA" recruitment videos reaching
out to multiple identity groups, including queer and Indigenous people.
Journalist Roberto Lovato cautioned readers about the resonance of this
moment in an aptly titled article, "**[The Age of Intersectional Empire
Is Upon Us]{.underline}**": "In the vast world that lives outside of
progressive circles, there are millions of people who have emotional
reactions to Army and Marine recruitment ads featuring proud Black and
Latinx soldiers."12

Formal political task forces, encouraging murals, and inspirational
commercials are serviceable carrots. But there's also, of course, the
stick. By June 2021, twenty-five state legislatures had introduced
legislation to ban the teaching of "critical race theory," as part of a
culture war backed by think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation and
Manhattan Institute, alongside well-connected individuals such as Mark
Meadows (a former White House chief of staff in the Trump
administration).13 In the United Kingdom, the British government formed
a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, which released a report
exonerating the government of the institutional racism alleged by Black
Lives Matter protes-tors.14 Where co-optation fails, regular old
repression will do.

So what, then, are we to make of identity politics? Some expressions of
identity politics are twisted to rebrand old imperial projects, while
others are actively banned by the powers that be. Is it itself an
innocuously different version of left politics, separated from more
orthodox left politics mainly by "failures of communication" as
philosopher Ashley Bohrer suggests?15 Or, more ominously, is identity
politics "an essential tool utilized by the bourgeoisie to maintain its
class domination over the working class by keeping workers divided along
racial and gender lines," as Dominic Gustavo alleges at the World
Socialist Web Site?16 Or is identity politics, as embodied in critical
race theory, a dangerous ideology and threat to the established order
that the powers that be aim to stamp out?

The Combahee River Collective (and Why Identity Politics Isn't What You
Think It Is)

The term "**[identity politics]{.underline}**" [was]{.underline} first
[popularized by]{.underline} the 1977 manifesto of [the **Combahee River
Collective**]{.underline}, an organization of queer, Black feminist
socialists, [and it was supposed to be about fostering **solidarity**
and **collaboration**]{.underline}.

American studies scholar Duchess Harris recounts the collective's origin
story as follows: in 1961, President John F. Kennedy convened a
Commission on the Status of Women. It was split into four consultative
bodies, one of which was the Consultation on Negro Women. This event
inspired sequels, and the third National Conference of Commissions on
the Status of Women birthed the meeting that founded the National
Organization for Women, which founders hoped would serve as an "NAACP
for women." However, NOW failed to live up to this promise to treat race
seriously---and Black nationalist organizations failed equally to
address gender.17 As a result, in 1973, activists formed the National
Black Feminist Organization.18

In 1974, the young activist Barbara Smith met Demita Frazier after she
began organizing an NBFO chapter in Boston. The pair agreed with many
NBFO goals but also wanted an organization that would discuss "radical
economics" more freely and that would guarantee a voice for lesbians.
And so, from a meeting of four, began the Combahee River Collective.
From 1977 to 1980, they held seven retreats with fellow activists, which
were attended by like-minded Boston veteran activists, and even the
famed writer Audre Lorde.

The experiences that united these activists---the consistent sidelining
and devaluation of their political priorities within different political
organizations---were foundational to the stance they developed, which
they christened "identity politics."

"We, as [black women]{.underline}, we actually [had a right to create
**political priorities** and **agendas** and **actions** and
**solutions**]{.underline} based in our experiences,"
**[Smith]{.underline}** later [explained]{.underline}---a political
agenda based in their full experiences and interests, rather than
positioning them as white women's tokens or as Black men's secretaries,
and one that incorporated the full complexity of their values, rather
than a degraded and misshapen caricature of them. [As]{.underline}
Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta [**Taylor** puts it]{.underline},
"One could not expect Black women to be wholly active in political
movements that neither represented nor advanced their interests";
therefore, the [[identity politics]{.underline}]{.mark} they developed
[[served as]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[entry points]{.mark}** for Black
women [to engage in politics]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[**rather**
than]{.mark} a **[whole cloth withdrawal]{.mark}** from problematic
organizations and movements]{.underline}.19

As such, [they were in favor of **diverse coalitional
organizing**]{.underline}, an approach that Smith later saw exemplified
by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign's grassroots approach and
its focus on social issues that people of many identities face,
especially "basic needs of food, housing and healthcare."20 Beverly
Smith, another of the group's founders, recalls the immediate political
effect of the group's statement among groups in the Boston left: "\[W\]e
also drew many women of color or who were not Black to us. We had
connections with Latinas. We had connections with Asian women. . . . And
they drew us too. Because [it **wasn't**]{.underline} just like **[one
way]{.underline}**. [When we'd find out about things that were
happening]{.underline}, [we would get ourselves there as
well]{.underline}."21 The collective's principled stance on identity
politics functioned as a principle of unity, rather than division.

But, [in the decades since]{.underline} the founding of the Combahee
River Collective, [[instead of **forging alliances across
difference**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[some have chosen to **close
ranks**]{.underline}]{.mark}---especially on social media---[around
**ever-narrower** conceptions of group interests]{.underline}. Smith
says, diplomatically, that many of today's common uses of the concept
are "very different than what we intended."22 Asad Haider puts it more
starkly in his book Mistaken Identity, where he acknowledges the radical
history of the concept while nevertheless describing identity politics
as "the ideology that emerged [to **appropriate** this emancipatory
legacy in service of the advancement of]{.underline} political and
economic **[elites]{.underline}**."23 While agreeing with these points,
I also agree with political theorist Marie Moran and philosopher Linda
Martín Alcoff who have both argued effectively that ideological
explanations that tie troubling political developments to the ideas
supposedly built into identity politics tend to miss the mark: many
criticisms target ideas that aren't essential to identity-based
movements or that misconstrue their basic goals entirely.24

The idea of "**[[elite capture]{.underline}]{.mark}**" helps reconcile
these two points with each other. It is true that recent developments in
the meaning and use of identity politics have not stopped police murders
or emptied prisons. Identity politics [has]{.underline}, however,
[[equipped]{.underline}]{.mark} people, organizations, and [institutions
with [a **new vocabulary** to describe]{.mark} their [**politics** and
**aesthetic**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[even if]{.mark} the
**[substance]{.mark}** of those political decisions [are]{.mark}
**irrelevant** or even **[counter]{.mark}** to the interests
of]{.underline} the [marginalized people]{.underline} whose identities
are being deployed. But that is a feature of how identity politics is
being used, rather than what identity politics is at its core. It is
this "elite capture"---not identity politics itself---that stands
between us and a transformative, nonsectarian, coalitional politics.

Elite Capture: The Bigger Problem

The concept of [elite capture]{.underline} originated in the study of
developing countries to describe the way socially advantaged people tend
to gain control over financial benefits, especially foreign aid, meant
for others. But the concept has also been applied more generally to
[describe how political [projects can be **hijacked** in **principle**
or in **effect**]{.mark} by the well positioned and
resourced]{.underline}. And yet, the idea also helps to explain how
[public resources such as **[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[attention]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **values** become
**distorted**]{.mark} and **distributed** by power
structures]{.underline}.

Elite capture accounts for many of the common objections leveled against
identity politics, including that it requires uncritical support for
political figures based on their identities without regard for their
politics and that it often reflects social preoccupations that are
"really for rich white people." One commentator, Saagar Enjeti,
criticized "the identity politics obsessed elite wing of the Democratic
party," alleging that "the people who populate our newsrooms" and
"populate the professional managerial class . . . have far too much of
an impact on our contemporary political discourse."25 Despite having
identified the problem with mainstream popular uses of identity politics
today---the outsize impact of well-positioned people on our political
discourse---Enjeti nevertheless seems to think this is a special problem
of one wing of one political party. In fact, [the underlying dynamics
are as old as politics itself and are **not confined** to a particular
politics of social identity]{.underline}.

[Elite capture is]{.underline} not a conspiracy. It's [**bigger**
than]{.underline} cynical appropriations, opportunism, or [the **moral
successes** or **failures** of any individual or group]{.underline}. [It
is]{.underline} a kind of **[system behavior]{.underline}**---a
phenomenon articulated at the population level, [an
**observable**]{.underline} (**[predictable]{.underline}**) [**pattern**
of actions involving individuals]{.underline}, [groups]{.underline},
[and subgroups]{.underline}, [each of whom may be pursuing **any number
of different goals** from their own narrow point of view]{.underline}.
[Elite capture is **not limited** to the scope of their
intentions]{.underline}. [The constant dynamic]{.underline} of
individual and group interactions [makes up a social
system]{.underline}, [and elite capture emerges out of that
dynamic]{.underline}.

#### Vote negative for [non-alignment]{.underline}. Refusing to adjudicate the 1AC is key to [conceptual decolonization]{.underline}. 

**Bright, 23**---Associate Professor, Department of Philosophy, Logic,
and Scientific Method, London School of Economics (Liam Kofi, "White
Psychodrama," The Journal of Political Philosophy, Volume 31, Issue 2,
June 2023, Pages 198-221, dml)

[The Non-Aligned person represents a kind of **ideal**]{.underline}, a
**[character type]{.underline}** to which one could be reconciled even
amid a society as so described. The basic idea is borrowed and adapted
from key ideas in Wiredu\'s philosophy of conceptual decolonization,71
so I will explain the big-picture strategy before giving more concrete
illustrations. Broadly speaking, I have fulfilled half of the task I set
for political philosophy in the introduction. I have outlined a cause
which prevents people being able to reconcile themselves to their social
order---the fact that the [ideology]{.underline} they espouse
[and]{.underline} the [material reality]{.underline} they live within
**[fundamentally come apart]{.underline}**, [the one always generating
**problems** for the other]{.underline}. And, at a high level, this
immediately suggests a path to reconciliation---make the world better
resemble the ideology, or the ideology better resemble the world. I will
presume here that in some form or another a racially egalitarian
ideology is to be maintained, and thus consider the more specific
question: [how can one **earnestly work** towards a more egalitarian
social structure]{.underline} given the situation we now find ourselves
in[?]{.underline} As I will outline in a moment, epistemic features of
the status quo make this a non-trivially difficult task to even attempt,
and so it requires certain characterological virtues that I shall use to
construct the Non-Aligned person\'s archetype.

And this is where the central idea from Wiredu comes in. The situation
of the person of colour facing the contemporary culture war, recognizing
it as doomed to incoherence, yet unsure of how to do better, shares
certain features with the situation of any formerly colonized person
trying to understand their present situation. Passing familiarity with
the history leading up to now makes it clear that [**key concepts**
through which one understands the social world]{.underline}, the
institutions charged with gathering and marshalling evidence about that
world, [and the [**bodies empowered** to **set the agenda**]{.mark} in
social discussion]{.underline}, [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} all
[[been]{.underline}]{.mark} developed by powers [indifferent or
[hostile]{.mark}]{.underline} to one\'s interests. And [yet it would
**clearly be facile** to **simply reject** whatever one inherits from
this nexus]{.underline}.72 After all, [this too **lets those same forces
set the agenda**]{.underline}. [It simply **adds a negation sign**
before stating a preferred response to someone else\'s
agenda]{.underline}. [[One must]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [develop the
skills and capacities to **[sift through the discourse space
cautiously]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**weigh** and **evaluate**]{.mark}
what one finds]{.underline}, [[and **synthesize** what is best]{.mark}
therein so that it serves ends one sets oneself]{.underline}. [[This
is]{.underline}]{.mark} what Wiredu calls **[[conceptual
decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [I]{.underline} shall more or
less [contract the **Non-Aligned** ideal to be an **ideal practitioner**
of conceptual decolonization within the]{.underline} present [culture
war]{.underline}, working towards the end of a genuinely racially
egalitarian socio-political order.

Let us then work through that abstract story as applied to our more
concrete case. First, why is it that the Non-Aligned person is in a
situation wherein they cannot trust their concepts, agenda-setting
agencies, or evidence-gathering institutions? This follows from the way
in which the culture war is sustained by a material inequality that no
one is seriously trying to fix. Repenters and Repressers are both
responding to discontent generated by an ideology--reality mismatch, but
neither of them wishes to either ideologically justify the material
inequality or give away their property and superior opportunities. But
as long as such material inequalities exist, they can generate stable
patterns of inegalitarian interaction in line with salient identity
categories.73 These can compound one\'s disadvantage the more
minoritized one is.74 And [even if]{.underline}, per impossible, [we
could somehow persuade all the whites to adopt the right sort of **inner
attitude**]{.underline}, [the wrong sort of **institutional structure**
can perpetuate racial inequality **regardless**]{.underline}.75

What\'s more, due attention to colonial history makes it apparent that
[regimes of stark and brutal racial [inequality can **last**]{.mark} **a
long time** [despite]{.mark} a firm majority of [the population thinking
them]{.mark} entirely [illegitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}.76
[Participants in the culture war]{.underline}, [organized]{.underline}
as it is [around **responding** to this situation]{.underline}, thus
[find themselves with **endless new fodder** with which to fuel their
battles]{.underline}. [[The ideology--reality mismatch is]{.mark}
**forever asserting** itself]{.underline}, [[**ever directing** their
intellectual]{.mark} and practical [attention]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} Du Boisian social [problem can be **temporarily**
forgotten or the guilt from failing to solve it meliorated for a
**moment**]{.underline}---[but it will **never stop generating new
instances** of itself]{.underline}, [never stop reaffirming its own
basic reality]{.underline}.

Hence as long as the material inequalities exist they will keep making
racial hierarchy salient whatever the Repressers want, and keep
generating reasons for guilt whatever the Repenters want. All of [the
institutions designed [to respond to]{.mark} this culture
war]{.underline}---which is essentially all of the epistemic
institutions controlled by the white bourgeois, which is to say all of
them---[are]{.underline} thus [fundamentally addressing the **wrong
questions**]{.underline} from the point of view of the Non-Aligned
person. [They are concerned with managing the results of [a tension they
can **never resolve**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which the nature of the
Repenter and Repressor conflict will not allow them to resolve. [They
[are not arranged to **produce info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline},
[[or **set an agenda**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [that will aid in resolving
material inequality]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} in fact
[[will **forever be supplied** with more]{.mark} culture war
[flashpoints]{.mark} on which to **focus** and with which [to
**distract**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since that will no doubt strike many as a bleak situation, it is worth
pausing here to address a temptation many have felt, which may indeed be
the psychological basis of many becoming PoC intelligentsia. If this is
all our society has to offer, [[why not **give in**]{.mark} to the
overwhelming temptation]{.underline} for an educated person of colour
[[and **participate**]{.mark} in the culture war]{.underline}, usually
from a perspective much more friendly to the Repenters? [Could we not
win **serious material change** by persuading them to act as our
agents?]{.underline} [And even if we cannot]{.underline}, [maybe
**pessimism** is simply the proper response to this]{.underline}; [and
[one **may as well at least get paid**]{.mark} for blunting the worst
edges of oppression]{.underline}. It is easy to see why this tempts, not
only for reasons of material interest mentioned above, but also in light
of the sort of policies and social standing which the Repenters would
seem to offer us. But [earnestly trying to **win** the culture war in
the sense of achieving **[victory]{.mark}**]{.underline} for either
Repenter or Represser [[is a **fool\'s errand**]{.underline}]{.mark};
[if those are the teams]{.underline}, [then **[the only winning move is
not to play]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

For one thing, [it is **impossible** that we shall **ever** be so
persuasive]{.underline}. [[The matters]{.mark} disputed [are
**sufficiently complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the
historical narrative **sufficiently
[contradictory]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [that there will **always**
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [the possibility of **reasonable
[disagreement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For another, [[many]{.mark} people
[**benefit** from the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, in the
obvious sense in which both Represser and Repenter strategies do not
involve surrendering white wealth and are thus relatively advantageous
to white elites when compared to seriously redistributive policies that
might actually advance the material welfare of black people. But even
beyond that there are [many]{.underline}, including both whites77 and
the PoC intelligentsia outlined above, who [materially benefit from the
perpetuation of the culture war as it now exists]{.underline}. [They
will **not be keen** to let go of it without a fight]{.underline}. [And
in a highly interconnected and ideologically diverse
society]{.underline}, [[everyone will always be able to find
**sympathetic intellectual spokespeople** to bolster]{.mark} their faith
in [their preferred narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under these
conditions, we should not expect any coherent grand narrative to achieve
consensus.78 [**[Strategic participation]{.mark}** on one side [might
**seem**]{.mark} like the **[pragmatic]{.mark} hard-nosed response** of
a realist]{.underline}, [[but it is **doomed** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
in fact simply [[a **waste of time**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Instead, [we should bear in mind that [some situations are **simply
beyond our control** and **can only do us harm by involving
ourselves**]{.mark}]{.underline}.79 [As long as the **material
circumstances** underlying the culture war remain the same]{.underline},
[neither]{.underline} the Represser nor the Repenter [archetype will
reliably act for our good]{.underline}. [That is not to counsel
**inaction**]{.underline}, [but rather to stress that our actions should
be aimed at **other ends**]{.underline}. With that, let us return and
ask ourselves: if [the Non-Aligned person]{.underline} cannot trust the
politico-epistemic institutions of the participants in the culture war,
nor reasonably hope to turn one of their sides into an engine for
change, what ought they to do instead?

Well, at a high level they [ought to act in such a way that they can
earnestly see themselves as sensibly working towards the eradication of
the material inequalities between racial groups]{.underline}. While it
is not the only way of advancing this goal, as a placeholder let us
assume the Non-Aligned person seeks to remove the ideology--reality
mismatch by securing the physical and cultural conditions necessary for
non-white people to enjoy republican freedom.80 There is good reason to
think that [this **cannot** be achieved by **mere [change in]{.mark}
people\'s [attitudes]{.mark}** [or **shifting**]{.mark} **interpersonal
etiquette [norms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.81 For republican freedom to be
attained, [**far-reaching modifications** in the basic economic
structure may]{.underline} well [be required]{.underline}.82 The
Non-Aligned character is therefore moved to seek out avenues for
effective collective action that might realize the necessary changes.
The question is then: [what sort of **attitudes** and **dispositions**
do they need]{.underline} to have to be effective at this[?]{.underline}

The psychological virtues necessary to work towards this under the
present situation are difficult to attain. As noted, [most of the venues
wherein intellectual work]{.underline} and cultural media [are produced
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} controlled by either Repenters or Repressers,
with whom Non-Aligned people are, well, not aligned. In so far as people
of colour have found a voice there, they have been [highly [vulnerable
to **elite capture**]{.mark}]{.underline}.83 Yet, [at least until
**counter-institutions** have been built which have sufficient
reach]{.underline}, [these are the spaces many of us must exist
in]{.underline}, [and persons whose work we must draw from]{.underline},
[if we are to **plan** and **coordinate** working out how to
collectively build a better world]{.underline}. What is more, all the
while those institutions will be humming to the rhythm of the perpetual
Repenter versus Represser conflict, as the world we inhabit continues
inevitably to defy their preferred ideologies. [We will]{.underline}
thus [be **bombarded** with messaging which claims that]{.underline}
their [culture war flashpoints are **supremely important** and **worthy
of our immediate attention**]{.underline}. [The Non-Aligned person must
learn to **tune out**]{.underline} the culture war noise, [while being
attentive to what is of value given their distinctive
projects]{.underline}. What sort of projects would these be, and what
sort of psychological dispositions would aid their completion?

It is unfortunately rather difficult to say what those distinctive
projects will be at this point, precisely because the present author is
one subject to all the epistemic disadvantages outlined. But we can say
a bit. [Before we engage in the project of trying to **refine** and
**disseminate** racial etiquette codes]{.underline},84 [Non-Aligned
persons will want some **evidence** that improved]{.underline} civility
[norms would **actually generate material redistribution**]{.underline}.
[Where there is some reason to think they will not]{.underline}, [we
will **simply set aside** such research projects and **reallocate our
attention elsewhere**]{.underline}. That is simply an example of a
broader point; [[an immediate project for a non-aligned intellectual
would be the **re-evaluation** of projects which are]{.mark} ostensibly
for the good of black people and presently [taking up]{.mark} much
**[time]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[attention]{.underline}**, [and
**resources**]{.underline}]{.mark}---such as racial etiquette
training85---and see which of these projects are premised on in fact
serving Repenter or Represser goals. [Where examples of [misallocated
resources]{.mark} are identified]{.underline}, as is the case for
etiquette training,86 [we will **[siphon off]{.mark}** resources [and
**prevent** people sympathetic to our cause]{.mark} from casting their
pearls here]{.underline}.

For a more positive example of a project we could engage in that has
both intellectual and more directly material elements, Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò has
recently advocated for a forward-looking vision of climate reparations,
concerned with what sort of world we can make together, in a fashion
that very much mirrors the concerns of the Non-Aligned person.87 What is
more, he argues that, due to many of the factors discussed in my
narrative earlier, any hope for a decent world for the vast majority of
the world\'s non-white population requires (among other things) the
provision of resources and technology to counteract the ecological and
political effects of climate change. This is a form of climate
reparations. To this we would perhaps wish to add research on ways in
which such people could become independent of the generosity and good
behaviour of the world\'s wealthy, in light of our adopted republican
ideals. But in any case, redirecting the conversation, practices, and
ultimately resources, involved in how we deal with reparations towards
specific climate ends requires powers we do not presently have, and a
mixture of skills and dispositions that are rare. Indeed, even thinking
about things this way is often very contentious.88 However, it is
exactly the sort of shift in mindset and practice we will need if we are
to carry out the Non-Aligned project of striving to actually resolve our
material inequalities.

With our examples of Non-Aligned scholar-activist projects before us, we
can think about what psychological virtues they require. And since both
require shifting focus quite dramatically within already established
areas of enquiry, we have our first characterological requirement of the
Non-Aligned person. By whatever psychological means necessary we must
stop granting the white bourgeoisie agenda-setting power over our own
concerns. That is to say, [the Non-Aligned person must cultivate
**mental self-determination** in order to ensure we are pursuing lines
of thought and action pertinent to our projects and responsive to our
concerns]{.underline}.89 For guidance in this we can look to outsider
political traditions that have also had to develop within the confines
of social forms they could not control.90 [This requires]{.underline} of
us a kind of [**self-conscious autonomy** in formulating and setting
**sub-goals** towards our ultimate end]{.underline}; [and a stance of
**reflective irony** towards what is being proffered as
important]{.underline} by institutions we cannot trust [is
essential]{.underline} to remaining Non-Aligned.

Relatedly, [[we must cultivate **dispassion** towards culture war
flashpoints]{.underline}]{.mark}.91 Repenters, Repressers, and
[[many]{.underline}]{.mark} of the PoC intelligentsia, [[will **insist**
we ought to **care deeply**]{.mark} about these issues]{.underline}.
[And [there are]{.mark} **genuinely [good arguments]{.mark}** for
affective engagement with political injustices]{.underline}.92
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}, where our own agenda of securing republican
freedom by changes to the material base does not independently confirm
their concerns to be of interest, [these [affective]{.mark}ly charged
[flashpoints are **nothing more than a
distraction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, Non-Aligned people are
psychologically formed in the environment of our narrative. Our
ill-considered passions are hence likely to align with the spurious
concerns of the Repressers and Repenters, and this can be very hard to
break free from.93 Hopefully, [[the]{.mark} **very [act of coming to
appreciate one\'s place]{.mark}** in the narrative [will help
**denaturalize**]{.mark} its concerns [and allow one to **better
liberate oneself** from]{.mark} being swept along by [the **affective
salience regime**]{.mark} it brings with it]{.underline}.94 [[This
allows one to **focus on what matters** to one\'s own project and
**better cooperate** with others]{.mark} to those ends]{.underline}.95

Of course, [this will not mean that we are **always
unconcerned**]{.underline} with whatever Repressers or Repenters care
about---the ability of the police to engage in extra-judicial killing
certainly affects poor black people\'s republican freedom! And [even
where our indifference is maintained]{.underline}, [[this should not
be]{.mark} understood as being **[simply
unfeeling]{.mark}**]{.underline}.96 [[But we must]{.mark} none the less
strive to **[maintain our own inner seat of judgement]{.mark}** apart
from the concerns the dominant culture attempts to foist upon
us]{.underline}.97 [[With our **own assessments** given
primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, the superior wealth and access to media of
the Repenters and Repressers will be unable to cajole or bribe us away
from our task.98 In this way, [we can carry out]{.underline} Wireduite
**[[conceptual decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, having put
ourselves in a position to sift through what our epistemic environment
offers us and select only what we need.

Cultivating [this]{.underline} inner space [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
hence [**[no]{.mark} mere personal [retreat]{.mark}** from the
world]{.underline}. [[It is **vital** to]{.underline}]{.mark} achieving
[the Non-Aligned person\'s goal]{.underline}. [By [ensuring one is able
to]{.mark} **effectively [work towards real
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [one may help create a]{.underline}
political [**community** and **material circumstance** where
all]{.underline}, now properly inclusive of non-white people, [may
freely exercise and live according to their own considered
judgements]{.underline}.99 This, then, is the ideal of the Non-Aligned
character archetype. Someone who can see themselves as genuinely
pursuing a reasoned approach to creating a better society, dispassionate
enough and at enough ironic distance not to get torn away from their
tasks by the raging of the Repenters and the Repressors, reconciled to a
project of genuinely resolving social incoherences rather than just
eternally responding anew to each successive dramatic demonstration of
this incoherence.

V CONCLUSION

Confusion is characteristic of a transitional society. This is a society
that has undergone sufficiently rapid changes in its mode of life and
ideological superstructure that the two have not yet had time to
properly adjust to each other.100 The case of race relationships is
especially fraught, because one effect of all these changes has been to
call the concept itself into question. Since the close of the twentieth
century, we have not even really agreed whether or not there is a
'there' there to race at all101---and this is no consequence-free
metaphysical disagreement; our technological practices embody (often
confused) notions of race.102 It is hence no surprise, and no reason for
shame, that we as a culture have had a hard time thinking through this.
The USA and the broader postcolonial world have not yet found a way of
making sense of themselves after de jure racist regimes. It is natural
enough that the narratives we have available are unsatisfying, and the
character archetypes available are not appealing roles.

I have offered as a more attractive character archetype the Non-Aligned
person. They seek to eliminate the mismatch between ideological
aspiration and material reality. This they do by rendering material
circumstances more akin to what one might expect given a racially
egalitarian ideology. That is to say, rather than solve the Du Boisian
social problem by trying to better manage its fallout, they wish to
simply eliminate the circumstances that gave rise to it. Since they have
to operate amid the present society with all its confusions and
distractions, I argued that [the Non-Aligned person needs to develop a
habit of considering issues with]{.underline} Stoical
**[dispassion]{.underline}**, [while maintaining **ironic
detachment**]{.underline} from the concerns of the other character
archetypes. In this way, [they can focus on achieving their
goals]{.underline}, [rather than be **distracted** by the pervasive and
highly affectively charged]{.underline} white psychodramas that
constitute the mainstay of Repenters and Repressers battling it out in
the [culture war]{.underline}. I hope this also illustrates how the
ideal of reconciliation can still guide political philosophers even in
non-ideal societies; we can think about what sort of person and project
would constitute a rationally satisfying mode of working towards the
better world, and work out how to create conditions that facilitate
occupying such a role.

But [whether]{.underline} my vision of [the Non-Aligned]{.underline} as
character [archetype]{.underline} with which one could be reconciled [is
appealing or not]{.underline}, [it is **imperative** that we **cease
investing our psychic energy** in the]{.underline} white bourgeoisie\'s
[culture war]{.underline}. [It will **never get better**]{.underline},
[and **only makes us worse**]{.underline}.

#### Conceptual decolonization is both [necessary]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline} to counter the [epistemic]{.underline} and [material violence]{.underline} of elite capture at a [global scale]{.underline}.

**Gaztambide, et al, 24**---visiting assistant professor in the
Department of Psychology at the New School for Social Research (Daniel
José, with Patience Ojionuka, Sarah Simon, Jasmine Rename, Gabriella
Diaz, and Josh Stell, "Standing Against Racial Capitalism: Reconsidering
Psychology's Role in Dismantling Systemic Racism," American
Psychologist, 2024 Volume 79, Issue 4 (May-Jun), dml)

Psychology's [[emphasis on **individual**]{.mark} change]{.underline}
and restrained policy [[results]{.mark} from]{.underline} its
[**capture** by neoliberalism]{.underline} (Adams et al., 2019). By
neoliberalism, we refer to an ideology and economic agenda organized
around market deregulation, limiting government as an expression of the
public good while preserving its functions to protect property and
capital, and an understanding of society as a collection of
entrepreneurial individuals competing for their self-interest.
[This]{.underline} neoliberal bias [frames racism]{.underline} primarily
[as a problem to be managed primarily at the **individual**
level]{.underline}---through DEI programs---while preferring policy that
does not require "too much" government intervention (Adams et al., 2019;
Malherbe et al., 2021).

As a response to the civil rights and labor gains of post-New Deal
coalitions, neoliberalism emerged over the course of the 50s, 60s, and
70s in the form of economic policies, resulting in massive inequality
along with racism as a tool to divide and conquer by the right-wing
Republican party and center-left elements of the Democratic party
(Lopez, 2019; T. Reed, 2020). Racism as politics was the handmaiden of
neoliberalism, operating in the form of "dog whistle politics,"
political messages that on the surface do not appear as racial appeals
yet trigger unconscious biases. The politics of racial fear communicates
three core messages: (a) fear lazy (and dangerous) people of color, (b)
distrust government as "coddling" the undeserving, and (c) trust the
marketplace and elites as the solution to our problems (Lopez, 2019).

[Such racial politics]{.underline} suppress support for redistributive
policies and empower right-wing politicians into office, who then enact
neoliberal policies that [**[worsen]{.mark}** both racial and economic
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline} (Engler & Weisstanner, 2021; Macdonald,
2021). Income inequality, in particular, is associated with a litany of
adverse outcomes, including worse medical and mental health, social
mobility, access to housing, health care, and education, among many
others---[**especially** for the most marginalized]{.underline}
(McCartney et al., 2019; Sami & Jeter, 2021; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2020).
Conversely, the fruits of racial capitalism are reaped by predominantly
white male elites who invest billions in campaigns mobilizing racism to
maintain the status quo (Freeman, 2021).

[The use of racism as a **divide** and **conquer** strategy to empower
elites is **endemic** to the history of colonialism]{.underline}, [with
roots in attempts by elites to **subvert** solidarity between enslaved
African peoples and indentured white servants]{.underline} from the
Caribbean to the New England colonies (Dabiri, 2021; Zinn, 2015). The
category "white," along with its mantle of privileges,
"**[[whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[was created]{.mark} precisely
[to promote]{.mark} cross-class [solidarity between]{.mark} **working
class** and **elite** [whites]{.mark}]{.underline} (Battalora, 2021;
Horne, 2020). [The [history]{.mark} of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, in tandem, [[is
not]{.mark} one of [linear progress]{.mark} and enlightenment
[but]{.mark} of multiracial [coalitions and]{.mark} civil [rights being
**corroded**]{.mark}]{.underline} time and again through the use of
racial politics [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} wealthy
**[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gosse, 2021; T. Reed, 2020).

**[Du Bois]{.underline}** (1935) [grasped the essence of racism as a
tool of **[elite power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. White workers, "while
they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public
and psychological wage" (p. 700). By opting for the psychological wages
of whiteness, white workers became complicit in "the wages of both
classes \[being\] kept low" (p. 701). Years later,
**[Fanon]{.underline}**, (1952/2008) [[underscored
the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[sociogenic]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[origins of]{.underline}]{.mark} internalized inferiority among
colonized peoples, resulting from a "double process: primarily,
economic, subsequently, the
**[[internalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[or]{.underline}]{.mark},
better the **[[epidermalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[emphasis
added\]---[of]{.underline} this [inferiority]{.underline}" (p. 4). He
cites Jean-Paul Sartre [in]{.underline} underscoring the function of
racism, "the rich for the most part exploit \[emphasis added\] this
passion for their own uses," seducing the white working class through
the belief that they too "belong to [the **elite**]{.underline}" (cited
in p. 64). In the end, a racial and economic hierarchy is enshrined,
depending on violence unleashed against people of color to maintain the
system's stability.

[The seduction of [**racial capitalism** positions anti-Blackness as a
**reference point** for desire]{.mark}]{.underline},
[uplift]{.underline}, [and pleasure for the white working
class]{.underline} (Roediger, 2022). As Harris (1993) articulated,
[whiteness as]{.underline} "**[property]{.underline}**" [serves as a
**material** and **symbolic** consolation prize under the brutality of
the market]{.underline}. While not all white people will "win" in the
market, whiteness ensures "they will not lose ... there is a limit to
how far they can fall" (pp. 1758--1759). As described above,
[[**patriarchy** fulfills similar functions]{.underline}]{.mark}. As
economic inequality dislocates familial and communal bonds, patriarchy
transforms the malaise and insecurity this produces into calls for women
to "return to the home" and claims that "white genocide" and "feminist
attacks" are destroying the white family and traditional gender norms
(Tebaldi, 2021, p. 80). [[Moral panic]{.mark} targeting trans and gender
nonconforming people also **[reinstates]{.mark}** [traditional]{.mark}
notions of [gender and sexuality]{.mark} [while **corroding**]{.mark}
the [social safety nets]{.mark} that would **protect**]{.underline} the
**[lives]{.underline}** of trans and cis people (Faye, 2022).

Drawing on D. A. Bell's (1992) work, we might say [the use of a
racial]{.underline}, [gender--sexual **scapegoat**]{.underline} "[for
failed economic or political policies **works every time**]{.underline}"
(p. 377). [Without the]{.underline} "**[deflective power]{.underline}**"
[of such]{.underline} "**[isms]{.underline}**," D. A. Bell (1993) wrote,
"[masses]{.underline} of whites [would]{.underline} likely **[wake
up]{.underline}** to [and **revolt**]{.underline} against the severe
disadvantage they suffer in income and opportunity when compared with
those whites at the top of our socio-economic heap" (p. 571).
[While]{.underline} he argued [this cross-class allegiance ensured
that]{.underline} "[[racism is **permanent**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
[this was [**not** an **internal pathology**]{.mark} of the white psyche
[but the result of **political economic arrangements**]{.mark} whose
purpose is to **maintain elite capital**]{.underline}. He did
**[not]{.underline}** see this [as a cause for **pessimism** but
a]{.underline} "[lifetime commitment to **fight**]{.underline} against
the racism that diminishes the lives of its supporters as well as its
victims" (p. 572).

This is [a sentiment we extend to our understanding of
**cisheterosexism**]{.underline}, in that a fight against patriarchy is
a fight against [the system that diminishes the lives of cisheterosexual
people as well as the queer and gender nonconforming people victimized
by it]{.underline}. Hence, we underscore, per McGhee and King, how [we
are part of a]{.underline} "**[network of mutuality]{.underline}**"
within which [[what]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[affects one
**directly**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[affects all
**indirectly**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (see above), revealing
[an]{.underline} "[**intersectionality** of suffering]{.underline}"
where [**despite** inhabiting different positionalities]{.underline} of
power and privilege, [we are all **connected** by a system that harms us
in different and distinct yet **related** ways]{.underline} (Gaztambide,
2024).

Against Racial Capitalist Realism: Critiquing the Elite Capture of
Idealism in Psychology

Despite [[the]{.mark} antiracist]{.underline},
[anticapitalist]{.underline}, [and anticolonial]{.underline} origins of
CRT, its idealist [**[permutation]{.underline}** [has been **captured**
by elite interests in ways that **preclude**]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[transformative [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Curry (2017a),
following Delgado (2004), tracked how [idealism is used to
[**de-emphasize** political economy through a **narrow focus**
on]{.mark} language and individual identity]{.underline}. At its
extreme, [this **idealist turn** insists that [**psychology** and
**beliefs**]{.mark} cause societal structures to arise]{.underline}
(Curry, 2007). Others like A. L. Reed and Chowkwanyun (2012) remarked
that [when]{.underline} the term "**[structural racism]{.underline}**"
[is invoked]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[structural]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [component]{.underline} often
**[[disappears]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[giving way to
a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[psychologistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
racism/anti-racism [political **[ontology]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (p.
167). [The **reification** of idealism]{.underline}---[**separating**
race from class and psychology from
**structure**]{.underline}---[is]{.underline} itself [reflective of a
particular class politics]{.underline} (p. 167).

Research on Western democracies suggests a political realignment took
place beginning in the 1950s, in which [the **center-left** and
**right-wing**]{.underline} across Western countries [reached a
**consensus** on [neoliberalism]{.mark} even as culture and identity
became **central** to their ideological conflicts]{.underline} (Gethin
et al., 2022). [While the right-wing adopts neoliberal economics
alongside anti-LGBTQ]{.underline}, [anti-immigrant]{.underline},
[antifeminist]{.underline}, [and anti-Black rhetoric]{.underline} (Faye,
2022; Lopez, 2019), [the center-left [offers
**palliatives**]{.mark}]{.underline} to injustice [[in]{.mark} the form
of symbolic]{.underline} "**[representation]{.underline}**" and
"diversity" [while leaving underlying economic conditions
**unchanged**]{.underline} (Táíwò, 2022a; Taylor, 2016; also Turner,
2010). Put differently, "**[culture wars]{.underline}**"
[reflect]{.underline} an ideological tension among center-left and
right-wing elites, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[never-ending
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[against]{.mark} racism as [a
**psychospiritual** force that leaves the]{.mark} political
[actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
economic structures]{.mark} that thrive from racism **virtually
[untouched]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the process, [neoliberal multiculturalism **co-opts** calls for
justice by **refashioning** them through the lens of a
**free-market**]{.underline}, representational, [**entrepreneurial**
view]{.underline} of equity and inclusion [whose goal is upward mobility
for some even as it **violently dispossesses** the most
vulnerable]{.underline}---the darker skin, immigrant, queer, and poor
(Melamed, 2011). [Given how neoliberal policies and economic inequality
shape meritocracy beliefs at the individual level]{.underline} (Goudarzi
et al., 2022; Mijs, 2021), [discussions of racial equity can similarly
**reproduce** a neoliberal logic in which access]{.underline} to
education, health care, and material security [is **limited** to people
of color who demonstrate]{.underline} "**[deservingness]{.underline}**,"
[while **disciplining** those who fall
short]{.underline}---[a]{.underline} "**[meritocracy 2.0]{.underline}**"
(Au, 2016). This can also influence how upwardly mobile, professional
managerial people of color frame equity and justice arguments within the
logic of neoliberalism (Gosine, 2019), such that it becomes impossible
to imagine a reality outside of capitalism as such (Fisher, 2022).

Fisher (2022) defined "capitalist realism" as the unconscious belief
that "capitalism \[is\] the only viable political and economic system
... impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative" (p. 2). If the
current system is "all there is," and our best recourse for redress must
be in primarily idealist terms (e.g., individual changes in bias,
representation for the "select few"), then, as Weis and Fine (2012)
wrote, [[this **limits** us to]{.underline}]{.mark} "[advocate merely
for **[more]{.mark} sweet**]{.underline}, [**quiet [spots]{.mark}** [of
**refuge**]{.mark} rather than for **structural change**]{.underline}"
(p. 175). Psychology's emphasis on idealism paradoxically results in
what we might call, borrowing from Fisher, a racial capitalist realism.
Conversely, Táíwò (2022a) reminds us that the **[[elite
capture]{.underline}]{.mark}** of idealist CRT is not limited to
psychology but [reflects]{.underline} "[how elites capture **all**
aspects of life]{.underline}, [including intellectual
movements]{.underline}, [under racial capitalism]{.underline}" (p. 29).
As the Jamaican British sociologist Hall (1997) intuited, [ideology
works to]{.underline} "**[freeze]{.underline}**" [meaning and language
to **constrain** our political imagination]{.underline}.

As a "New Left" scholar, Hall (1997) witnessed the capture of identity
politics in real time, rendering calls for social justice "appropriated
to a softer version of itself. It requires 'sleeping with the enemy'"
(p. 37). Hall observed this dynamic throughout politics, giving the
example of how a "public/private" transport system was developed in
Britain over a nationalized system to accommodate business interests.
American psychology is not immune to these pressures, which is why as a
discipline it can advocate for diversity and inclusion even as it has
been complicit in the immigration and prison--industrial complex (see
Klukoff et al., 2021), alongside its documented participation in torture
through the military--industrial complex (Hoffman, 2015; Orford, 2017;
Soldz et al., 2011). The APA resolution's favoring of more conservative,
private/public approaches to policy reflects these tensions.

Again, [such an approach [offers]{.mark} the possibility of upward
[mobility for **some**]{.mark} people of color]{.underline}, [queer
folk]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} women]{.underline}, [while maintaining
[**precarity** for **all**]{.mark} under racial capitalism]{.underline}
(T. Reed, 2020). [This presents a]{.underline} "**[poisoned
apple]{.underline}**" [insofar as upward mobility confers **diminishing
returns**]{.underline} to people of color and specifically Black
people's well-being, [such that]{.underline} "**[moving
up]{.underline}**" [confers **limited** protection]{.underline} against
racism (Assari et al., 2018). [We advocate **transcending** a
representational politics that [presumes a]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[trickle-down]{.mark} social
[justice]{.mark}]{.underline}**"---[[that elevating
**some**]{.underline}]{.mark} people of color into power or middle-class
status [somehow [translates into material gains for **all**]{.mark}
people of color]{.underline} (Taylor, 2016). We maintain that [a
**[decolonial]{.mark}**]{.underline} realist [[perspective is the
**antidote**]{.mark} to the racial capitalist realism that one-sided
idealism engenders]{.underline}. Put differently, a realist approach
moves us beyond the narrow focus on individual bias and representation,
[[**expanding** our]{.mark} political [imagination to]{.mark} ensure
[justice not just for]{.mark} the]{.underline} "**[select
[few]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [[but for **all**]{.mark} who have been
oppressed across our communities]{.underline}. This brings us back to
the role of robust public policy and its political implications.

The Fusion of Universal and Race-Conscious Policy to Transform Society:
Toward a Decolonial Politics in Assemblage

Our position is that [the combination of universal and
population-specific policies]{.underline}---targeting racial
discrimination and disparities---[will lead to the **most salubrious**
outcomes]{.underline} (Bakhtiari et al., 2018) [and [represent a
**challenge to elite power**]{.mark} within racial
capitalism]{.underline}. Given the intersectionality of suffering
outlined above, we offer examples of these policies to illustrate how
[universal [policies can **close**]{.mark} racial
[inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} how
race-conscious policies [[yield benefits]{.mark} to **society [at
large]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As discussed earlier, income inequality worsens mental health outcomes
(Dev & Kim, 2020) that are also implicated in racial disparities
(Manduca, 2018). [Redistributive [**tax** policy]{.mark}]{.underline},
for example, [not only leads to **salubrious outcomes**]{.underline}
"[for **all**]{.underline}" [but exerts a **larger** effect for Black
households]{.underline} (Hardy et al., 2022). Similarly,
[[raising]{.mark} the **minimum [wage]{.mark}** []{.mark}improves
**mental health** outcomes]{.underline} (Kuroki, 2021) [and closes
racial wealth and health gaps]{.underline} (Derenoncourt & Montialoux,
2021; Mishel & Bivens, 2021; Williams & Cooper, 2019). [Given the burden
of student loan debt on Black borrowers]{.underline}, [**universal [debt
cancelation]{.mark}** would close the racial wealth gap]{.underline},
with even \$50,000 in cancelations alleviating debt for three in four
Black households and increasing Black wealth by a third (Banerjee,
2021). [Policies that reduce economic and [racial]{.mark} inequality
**curtail** elites' economic and political power]{.underline}, [given
that such policies [are correlated with lower]{.mark} corporate
**[profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[higher]{.mark} involvement in
**[unions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} higher
**wages**]{.underline} (Reich, 2021).

We want to recognize the APA resolution's mention of labor unions and
"broad parental leave and daycare program\[s\]" (APA, 2021c). We extend
this to [[consider]{.mark} the positive
effects]{.underline}---[especially for working-class families of
color]{.underline}---[of **[universal childcare]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Miller et al., 2020) [[alongside **unions**]{.mark} as part of [a
**robust policy**]{.mark} **[set]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given how
prolonged contact improves intergroup relations (Meleady et al., 2021),
[**research** shows unions **increase support** for redistributive
policies and policies specifically benefitting African
Americans]{.underline} (Franko & Witko, 2023; Frymer & Grumbach, 2021).
We suggest the goal of future DEI programs should be precisely to form
and encourage labor unions as an antiracist strategy that provides a
solidarity dividend (McGhee, 2021). Put differently,
[providing]{.underline} education and [**concrete examples** of how our
suffering is different and distinct yet structurally related [would
**foment the solidarity needed**]{.mark} to address racial and economic
inequality]{.underline}. For example, by supporting universal childcare
for all workers---Black, white, and Brown (Lopez, 2019).

The implementation of universal policies must not be color-blind but
targeted to address the specific disadvantages vulnerable populations
face (Rossi & Táíwò, 2020). Relatedly, [we also advocate for **targeted
policies** such as **[reparations]{.mark}**]{.underline} for descendants
of slavery in the United States. While a full account of the
philosophical complexities of reparations is beyond our scope, we focus
on their impact on racial wealth and health gaps. [**Data-driven
simulations** suggest reparations would [close **wealth
inequality**]{.mark} between Black and white people and substantially
[reduce the **longevity gap**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Himmelstein et al.,
2022). Reparations, then, are as much economic as it is public health
policy (Bassett & Galea, 2020). While research underscores the impact of
[reparations]{.underline} on African Americans, it [would also
[exert]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[bottom-up]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[effects throughout society as a **whole**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, recent research sheds light on how improvements in the social
conditions and well-being of African Americans will translate into
economic and public health gains for white people as well (see Bowser &
Austin, 2021).

Given the relationship between income inequality and COVID-19 infections
and mortality (Tan et al., 2021), [reparations have the potential for
**[reducing transmission risk]{.mark}** for African Americans [while
**mitigating infections**]{.mark} for the population **at
large**]{.underline} (Richardson et al., 2021). As stated above, [racial
capitalism was a **fundamental cause** of the]{.underline} COVID-19
**[pandemic]{.underline}** (Laster Pirtle, 2020). For example, rather
than advocating for closures that could have saved lives, elites pushed
for the U.S. economy to stay open as long as possible, rendering Black
and Brown workers simultaneously "essential" and expendable, producing
billions in wealth for elites who siphoned that wealth from the populace
(Edwards, 2021).

Although we cannot cover the pragmatics of reparations here, we point to
Darity et al. (2022) and Attorney General's Office (2023) who present
actionable methodologies for what reparations might look like. We also
acknowledge there are other policies we did not explore at length, such
as the return of land to Indigenous people (see Chin, 2021). Relatedly,
we do not imply the only vehicles to challenge [[elite
power]{.underline}]{.mark} are through, say, progressive taxation, as
the construction of the "taxpayer" has complicated relations to settler
colonialism (Willmott, 2022). Although we focus on the United States, we
caution against a redistribution of resources that merely repurposes
wealth extracted through militarism and neocolonialism from the global
south (Andrews, 2021). In discussing these policies, we hope to start a
conversation that sheds light on how suffering in the United States [[is
connected to]{.underline}]{.mark} its structural instantiations and
expands to consider the implications of its foreign policy abroad,
especially for immigrants and others dislocated by
[**[war]{.underline}**, **[economic crisis]{.underline}**, [and
**ecological catastrophe**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Massey, 2020).

As Hall (1997) observed, social democratic policies like those reviewed
above are also not immune to elite capture insofar as they can be used
to redirect away from revolutionary change. Thus, [we make no claim to a
politics **untarnished** by our racial capitalist world]{.underline}.
[We are]{.underline}, as Wayne Yang wrote via his persona Lapaperson
(2017), [[an]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[assemblage]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[decolonizing dreamers]{.underline}]{.mark}** ... part of the
\[colonial\] machinery and part machine themselves" (p. 9). Yang
provocatively explored how [we [can be **impacted** by
structures]{.mark}]{.underline}, [come to [**adopt**
them]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} yet still have
**agency** as people who have]{.underline} "[[**reassembled** them to
**decolonizing purposes**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (p. 9). In exploring
[[this]{.mark} assemblage of policies]{.underline}, we seek to **[[shake
the foundations of racial capitalism itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(White, 2021), [**reorganizing** our **world** and **[placing a check on
elite power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which entails [**dismantling** the
very tools the white]{.underline}, [male]{.underline}, [and wealthy have
used to **build** this system]{.underline}. In framing the intersecting
nature of "imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy" (hooks,
2000, p. 46), [our policy recommendations are attempts not merely
to]{.underline} "**[repair]{.underline}**" [the world but to **imagine**
and **assemble** a new one]{.underline} (Táíwò, 2022b).

A Psychology for Liberation Without Equivocation: Toward Antiracist
Anticapitalism

In a recent contribution introducing the public psychology for
liberation training model, Neville et al. (2021) discussed the
resistance to a fully decolonial, liberationist model for training
psychologists, including disagreement "with the social justice
orientation stance to improving society and the lives of people through
an antioppression lens, including anticapitalism \[emphasis added\]" (p.
1263). We echo this concern in our field and with respect to APA's
initiatives on health equity and racial justice (APA, 2021a, 2021b,
2021c). We reiterate our appreciation of our task force colleagues,
council members, and staff who contributed to a transformative moment in
our discipline's history. But we still have far to go. [We [cannot stand
against]{.mark}]{.underline} racism as [[an
**amorphous**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[individualized]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} "**[[psychologized]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[entity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We [must combat]{.mark}]{.underline}
racism as [[a]{.mark} political]{.underline},
[[material]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and sociocultural
[force]{.mark}]{.underline} embedded within capitalism as such.

[This [requires a **paradigm shift** in]{.mark}]{.underline} how we
conceive of training within the helping professions, as well as in [our
conceptualization of **[suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Gaztambide,
2024; Gaztambide et al., 2022). It also requires a shift from how we
conceive of justice as such. Neoliberal ideology tends to reify the
politics of recognition, emphasizing difference while erasing the
importance of redistribution. In retrieving the importance of a
dialectic of recognition and redistribution, we also imagine how
redistribution destabilizes difference and promotes solidarity (see
Fraser, 2020). As Fanon (1952/2008) analyzed long ago, recognition also
depends on forms of charity that reinscribe colonial structures of white
supremacy. As Dabiri (2021) wrote,

[It seems a [**huge tactical error** to frame]{.mark} antiracism as [a
**petition** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the kindness or **[[better
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the "good," "selfless" individual. As
such, [allyship appeals to a desire to help a]{.underline}
"**[victim]{.underline}**," [constituting a reification of the power
imbalance]{.underline}. **[[Coalition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the
other hand, [[is about **mutuality**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It reframes
the task as [identifying **common ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[while
[attending to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[specificities]{.underline}]{.mark}** of racism---[[that **all** can
strive for and]{.mark} that **all** will [benefit]{.mark}
from]{.underline}. (p. 85)

In seeking to assemble a society that works for "the sum of us" (McGhee,
2021), [we invite our]{.underline} white and non-white
[colleagues]{.underline} to engage in this work not as allies but as
accomplices (Indigenous Action Center, 2014), willing [to [**get messy**
and **explore how much of our work has been
captured**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and what we need to do to **free**
ourselves and our communities]{.underline}.

What we call the [[elite capture]{.underline}]{.mark} of CRT idealism
[**[distorts]{.mark}** not only the [**revolutionary insights**
of]{.mark} our [traditions and ancestors but]{.mark} also [**elides**
the knowledge of]{.mark} antiracist and Indigenous [activists on the
**ground**]{.mark} across the global north and south]{.underline}, many
of whom are resoundingly anticapitalist (see Movement for Black Lives,
2024; People's Agreement of Cochabamba, 2010). [This]{.underline}
"**[[epistemological violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[occurs]{.mark}
when we **erase** diverse ways of knowing and interpret phenomena in
ways that **distort** the **realities** of marginalized
communities]{.underline} when there are viable and important alternate
interpretations (Teo, 2010; cf. Escobar et al., 2020). [The]{.underline}
reification and [**elite capture** of the idealist approach enacts
precisely such an erasure in ways that **maintain** systems of
oppression]{.underline} within terms legible to neoliberal ideology.

### Link---Academy---2NC

#### Spill-out is [reverse goldilocks]{.underline}---their [mindset shift]{.underline} doesn't, but their [capture by elites]{.underline} does.

**Thomas, 25**---Professor of Sociology at the State University of New
York at Oneonta (Alexander, "Not Religion," *The Sociological
Predicament: Academia and the Contradictions of Working Class
Consciousness*, Chapter 8, pp. 178-179, dml)

[Academia is a **subsystem** within the larger social
system]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} like all complex adaptive
systems, [it is composed of **individual actors**]{.underline}---you
know, **[people]{.underline}**! Although a system-level logic of
academia is to formulate and promote ideas that promote social stability
(but not necessarily integration), [individual people have a diversity
of ideas]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} diversity **[filters out to
society at large]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the [**debates**
within the **academy** become part of the **wider societal
debate**]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, the [debates are
frequently]{.underline} "**[watered down]{.underline}**," and the debate
around, for example, evolution is dissimilar in the public eye from the
(largely settled) debate on campus. [These processes lend themselves to
**factionalization**]{.underline}, and at times, [the **clash** over the
nature of reality develops a logic **divorced** from the **original
debate**]{.underline}. When academics align with a faction, they show
themselves to be another political actor like any other and undeserving
of any more or less respect than other political actors. Those not in
the favored tribe will see the institution as hostile, and the goal of
positive social change is out of reach.

So why didn't the left decry Michelle Obama's callous comparison of
living in Trump's America to children visiting their possibly suicidal
divorced father? Because she's "one of us" and deserves forgiveness, but
"they" do not. One would hope that a goal of sociology would be to
illuminate the process and circumstances that lead to human suffering.
In a hierarchical society, however, suffering itself must be
hierarchical. In a society in which there is poverty, the middle class
obsession of discerning the deserving poor from those not so respectable
occurs so the "system" can continue to function without redistribution
of resources. Ultimately, the primary difference between American
political parties is how they define the deserving poor: Republicans see
them as people who lost their jobs due to "unfair" competition, whether
by government agencies or foreign companies or recent immigrants. For
Democrats, it is discrimination based on unchangeable characteristics.
Neither is an effective explanation because they are based on
individuals acting badly rather than the system as a whole maintaining
itself as a system. Social structure is not an aggregation of
individuals; it is a complex system with emergent characteristics that
has a logic of its own. Both "sides" choose to ignore the system
effects.

Red Washing

The deemphasis of sociology as a scientific endeavor and the discipline
[that]{.underline} requires (as opposed to the fantasy of machinelike
detachment) [enables a subculture that **claims** to fight the system
while]{.underline} performing the traditional sagely role of
[constructing ideologies that in actuality **support** the social
order]{.underline}. [A capitalist]{.underline} (and probably any)
[society requires a mechanism for **channeling** radical ideas into
forms **acceptable** for social order]{.underline}.11 In the
twenty-first century, [**simplified** versions of radical thought have
worked their ideas into popular discourse and become **opaque
deflections** of the original]{.underline}. This is perhaps nowhere more
obvious than in Critical Race Theory, bugaboo of the right who, for the
most part, fail to recognize their favorite targets are the versions of
CRT recuperated to be friendly to the social order.

The works so feared by the right are sacred texts aimed at deflecting
PMC attention from the knowledge of the sociological predicament. [Most
academics want to believe they are promoting **positive social change**
rather than **benefiting** from inequalities based]{.underline}, in
part, [on the **credentialism** academia requires]{.underline}. These
texts perform this function by being true but not complete, [thereby
**deflecting** attention away from information that **conflicts** with
the subcultural desire to be agents of good]{.underline}. [The texts
form the liturgical basis for **rituals** that **reaffirm** the moral
rectitude of the subculture and promote the **self-esteem** of the
individuals within]{.underline}; [the **high ritual** is the **act of
protest itself**]{.underline}. [The **elite capture** of protest is most
often evident in the selection of **reasons**]{.underline}:
[causes]{.underline} from around the planet [that **do**]{.underline},
in fact, **[deserve]{.underline}** the [**attention** but]{.underline}
also serve to [**narrow** the focus of activism **away** from matters
that **expose**]{.underline} the [class relations]{.underline} and, in
particular, the privilege of the PMC practitioners. [The system operates
by promoting works that are **superficially radical** but **narrow** the
focus of animus from the system as a **whole** to benefit of **specific
categories** of oppressed]{.underline}. The authors and readers of such
works frequently benefit from the very social arrangements about which
they write and paradoxically have an interest in maintaining them. Their
dependence upon the conditions they decry is the basis of a cognitive
dissonance that must be repressed and is the basis for the shape of the
rituals themselves.

### Link---Deference---2NC

#### The aff focuses on the elites within [\[x scholarship/x marginalized group\]]{.mark} and ignores everyone else -- that only results in them gaining more power while simultaneously placing the rest of the group in a worse position. 

**Táíwò, 22**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity
Politics (and Everything Else), Deference Politics, 23-24, ZMR

[A prime example of deference politics is the call to "listen to the
most affected" or "center the most marginalized,"]{.underline} now
ubiquitous in many academic and activist circles. These calls have never
sat well with me. In my experience as an academic and organizer, when
people have said they needed to "[listen to the most affected," it
wasn't usually because they intended to set up Skype calls to refugee
camps]{.underline} or to collaborate with houseless people. Acting on
this conception of "centering the most marginalized" would require a
different approach entirely, in a world where 1.6 billion people live in
inadequate housing (slum conditions) and 100 million are unhoused, a
full third of the human population does not have reliable drinking
water, and the intersections of food, energy, and water insecurity with
the climate crisis have already displaced 8.5 million people in South
Asia alone, while threatening to displace tens of millions more.17 [Such
a stance would require, at a minimum, that one leave the
room]{.underline}. Instead, "[centering the most
marginalized]{.underline}" in my experience has usually meant [handing
conversational authority and attentional goods to whoever is already in
the room and appears to fit a social category associated with some form
of oppression]{.underline}---regardless of what they have or have not
actually experienced, or what they do or do not actually know about the
matter at hand. Even in rooms where stakes have been high---where
potential researchers were discussing how to understand a social
phenomenon, where activists were deciding what to target---the [rules of
deference have often meant that the conversation stayed in the room,
while the people most affected by it stayed outside]{.underline}. This
particular politics of deference emerged out of a theoretical
orientation called standpoint epistemology, which became popular in
feminist circles in the 1970s and has continued to contribute to the
thinking of many activists and academics since.18 Standpoint
epistemology comprises three seemingly innocuous ideas: 1) knowledge is
socially situated, 2) marginalized people have some advantages in
gaining some forms of knowledge, and 3) research programs (and other
areas of human activity) ought to reflect these facts. These ideas
should go down easy. As Liam Kofi Bright argues, any serious empiricist
philosophy would entail all three of these points.19 Moreover, they are
politically important: they point to the value of lived experience and
the knowledge that comes from it. At face value, a c[ommitment to these
ideas should help us resist and contain elite capture]{.underline}. They
should provide a basis for respecting knowledge that the institutions of
the world otherwise want to discredit. But the devil is in the details.
The [common approaches to putting these abstract ideas into practice
emphasize deference to others in conversational contexts]{.underline},
in an effort to fix the distribution of attention: [they ask that we
pass the mic]{.underline}, believe marginalized people, and give
offerings. The motivation is admirable, and these actions themselves are
often good ideas, as far as they go. But [aside from involving attitudes
and interpersonal dynamics, oppression---racism, ableism, xenophobia,
patriarchy, and so forth---also have serious material
consequences]{.underline}. These structures of injustice decide who has
reliable access to basic interpersonal security, housing, health care,
water, and energy. All of these consequences of bigotry, from the
attitudinal to the material, have to be dealt with if we are to address
oppression. The [politics of deference focuses on the consequences that
are likeliest to show up in the rooms where elites do most of their
interacting: classrooms, boardrooms, political parties]{.underline}. As
a result, we seem to end up with far more, and more specific, practical
advice about how to, say, allocate tasks at a committee meeting than how
to keep people alive. [Deference as a default political orientation can
work counter to marginalized groups' interests.]{.underline} We are
surrounded by [a discourse that locates attentional injustice in the
selection of spokespeople and book lists taken to represent the
marginalized, rather than focusing on the actions of the corporations
and algorithms that much more powerfully distribute
attention]{.underline}. This discourse ultimately participates in the
weaponization of attention in the service of marginalization. It directs
what little attentional power we can control at symbolic sites of power
rather than at the root political issues that explain why everything is
so fucked up. A trip down memory lane provides a powerful example of
both the opportunities and limitations of the deferential approach. In
2007, Barack Obama was on the campaign trail for the US presidency.
Obama had just lost two of the first three primary contests to Hillary
Clinton. He gave a speech to a small crowd in Greenwood, South Carolina,
looking exhausted and disheartened. Suddenly, an attendee named Edith S.
Childs called out words of encouragement: "Fired up, ready to go!"
People around her repeated the chant, and the energy in the crowd
crescendoed. After a newly energized Barack Obama crushed Clinton in the
South Carolina primary, those five words became a slogan of the campaign
that carried the young upstart into the White House.20 Two years later,
President Barack Obama went back out on the speaking trail---this time
to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in defense of his fight to expand access to
health care. President Obama explained that he always believed that
change doesn't come from the top down; it comes from the bottom up. . .
. It "begins with you sharing your stories, fighting for something
better."21 But what does change coming from the "bottom up" mean, in
this context? The president was remarkably explicit: "\[I\]t goes to
show you how one voice can change a room. And if it changes a room, it
can change a city. And if it can change a city, it can change a state.
And if it can change a state, it can change a nation. If it change\[s\]
the nation, it can change the world." In other words, the president held
forth a model of change flowing through approved channels and
hierarchies atop which, ultimately, he stood. We [tend to be on our
guard for this kind of cynical use of "bottom up" thinking by elites
when we deal with politicians and formal, electoral
politics]{.underline}. But, as political theorist Jo Freeman has argued,
our own rooms are not free of this phenomenon.22 According to Freeman,
[any group of people]{.underline} [interacting with each other will
structure itself]{.underline} in some way or other, whether consciously
or unconsciously, leaving only the question of how that resulting
structure distributes resources, responsibilities, attention, and power.
[Elites from marginalized groups can benefit from deference in ways that
are at least compatible with social progress,]{.underline} especially if
we take the right actions afterward. But treating such elites' interests
as necessarily or even presumptively aligned with the broader group's
interests involves a political naivete we cannot afford. In this
context, [confusion about elite interests functions as a form of racial
Reaganomics]{.underline}: a strategy reliant on fantasies about the
exchange rate between the attention economy and the material economy. We
need to [fix the social structure itself---the rooms we interact in, and
the house they make up. Deference, as a strategy, bears at best a
tenuous relationship to this goal.]{.underline}

#### Deference politics only serves to forward the agenda of the elites.

Unlike structurelessness, [deference politics doesn't mask its
distributive consequences]{.underline}. Visible performance of a
deferential act of "[passing the mic" or "stepping back]{.underline}" in
order to give attention or space to another person does [tend to
redistribute short-term attention, as promised]{.underline}. But
[deference politics can still mask essential power
relation]{.underline}s, especially when we consider the performance in
the context of the people who aren't in the room at all. For instance,
[one white person giving the mic to the specific person of color in the
room can obscure both the overall power dynamics]{.underline} of the
room and the whole room's relationship to the broader category of
"people of color" that a particular comrade is taken to represent. It
would be reasonable to assume that most of those who practice standpoint
epistemology deferentially do so for the right reasons, and that they
trust the people they share the room with to help them find the proper
practical expression of their joint moral commitments. [Indeed, we don't
need to attribute bad faith to all or even most of those who practice
deferential politics to]{.underline} [explain the
phenomenon.]{.underline} Bad roommates aren\'t the problem, for the same
reason that being a good roommate isn\'t the solution: the problem is
that we are still trapped in the room. [If we want better politics, we
have to challenge how those rooms are put together]{.underline}, the
security system that controls access to them, and the rules that dictate
what happens in them. For illustration, we can return to the question of
how you came to read this book-how it is that you and I are interacting
through this text, right now. To do so, we have to consider the layers
of history, politics, and geography that made its writing possible. Many
aspects of our social system serve as filtering mechanisms, determining
which interactions happen and between whom, and thus, what social
patterns people are in a position to observe. For the majority of the
twentieth century, the US immigration quota system made legal
immigration with a path to citizenship available almost exclusively to
Europeans (earning Adolf Hitler\'s regard as the world \"leader in
developing explicitly racist policies of nationality and immigration,\"
in the words of legal scholar James Q. Whitman),24 But the 1965
Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration possibilities to
more people, with a preference for \"skilled labor.\" My family migrated
from Nigeria to the United States under these auspices, becoming part of
the Nigerian American community that makes up one of the country\'s most
successful immigrant populations. What no one mentions, of course, is
that the 112,000 or so Nigerian Americans with advanced degrees are
utterly ~~dwarfed~~ \[outweighed\] by the 82 million Nigerians who live
on less than a dollar a day. The selectivity of US immigration law helps
explain the rates of educational attainment in the Nigerian diasporic
community that raised me, which in turn helps explain the wealth, class
advantages, and cultural expectations that fueled my own educational
development.25 The class advantages I grew up with help explain which
rooms I was educated and socialized in during elementary and middle
school, which in turn help explain my entry into the exclusive Advanced
Placement and honors classes in high school, while others from more
disadvantaged backgrounds were routed through remedial courses. This in
turn helps explain my access to higher education, which involved
admission to schools from which others were rejected, and so on. Indeed,
the education system is a ready and uncommonly explicit example of
selection processes. T[his is the trajectory that explains why my
thoughts on elite capture were originally accepted]{.underline} and
published as an article in The Philosopher, 26 and why I have the
resources now to write a whole book that even nonphilosophers might
read. It\'s a case in point of what [sociological researchers call
\"cumulative advantage\"]{.underline} or the \"Matthew effect\": the
[people who were successful yesterday are likeliest to get today\'s
rewards]{.underline}, which makes them yet more likely to get
tomorrow\'s as well.7 With these selections in view, it is [easy to see
how this deferential form of standpoint epistemology contributes to
elite capture at scale]{.underline}. The [higher the form of education,
the narrower the social experience.]{.underline} Some s[tudents are
pipelined to PhDs, while others are pipelined to prisons-and the very
oppressive structures we aim to challenge largely explain who goes
where]{.underline}. Deferential ways of dealing with identity can easily
inherit the distortions caused by these selection processes. But it\'s
equally easy to see locally---in this room, in this social space, in
this conversation-why deference seems to make sense. It may be an
improvement on the epistemic procedure that preceded it. The [Black
person in the elite room may well be better positioned than non-Black
people in this space to think about policing and
incarceration]{.underline}. So, if we have to listen to one person,
[perhaps it\'s better that it be a Black person]{.underline}, even an
affluent and privileged Black person, [than the affluent and privileged
white person who would otherwise have dominated the
discussion.]{.underline} Put another way, deference can often seem like
the best we can do in the face of what we take to be the fixed facts
about the room and its purpose, and who\'s in it. [But these are the
last facts we should want to hold fixe]{.underline}d. And [if our aim is
simply to do better than the epistemic norms that we\'ve inherited from
a history]{.underline} of explicit global apartheid, that is an [awfully
low bar to set]{.underline}. The facts that explain who ends up in what
room shape our world much more powerfully than the squabbles for
comparative prestige between people who have already made it inside. And
w[hen the conversation is about social justice, the social mechanisms
that determine who gets into the room are often exactly what needs to
change]{.underline}---for example, the fact that incarcerated people
cannot participate in academic discussions about freedom is intimately
related to the fact that they are physically locked in cages. Still,
deference does have attractive qualities. [After all, the people in
powerful rooms, to whom others defer, may be \"elites]{.underline}\"
relative to the larger group they represent, but disadvantaged relative
to the other people in the rooms with them. [Our sense of ourselves-and
the patterns of deference we tend to fit to our standpoint
epistemological commitments--- often foregrounds the ways in which we
are marginalized]{.underline}, rather than the ways we are not. A
privileged person in an absolute sense (a person belonging to, say, the
half of the world that has secure access to \"basic needs\") may
nevertheless experience themselves consistently on the low end of the
power dynamics of their immediate social world. The rooms we are in,
which is to say the social dynamics we actually experience, play a
central part in developing and refining our political subjectivity and
our sense of ourselves. [Deference responds to real, morally weighty
experiences of being put down, ignored, sidelined,
silenced]{.underline}. The fact that others have graver problems does
not legitimate bigotry toward the relatively advantaged People are---and
ought to be-vying for respect, dignity, and some measure of recognition
alongside policy reforms and material redistribution. [We all deserve
these attentional goods, which are often denied, even to the \"elites\"
of marginalized and stigmatized groups]{.underline}. Moreover,
distributions of respect and care can be won and lost collectively;
there is some connection between the inside of the room and the outside.
The [deference interpretation of standpoint epistemology thus has an
important non-epistemic appeal to such elites]{.underline}: it
[intervenes directly in morally consequential practices]{.underline} of
giving attention and respect. This focus on one\'s own relative
marginalization is especially easy to cultivate when exposure to people
below us in the relevant hierarchies is controlled or prevented, which
is, after all, a great deal of what rooms do. This [foregrounding of the
personal happens for a reason that is entirely compatible with the ethos
of \"standpoint epistemology\" and valuing lived
experienc]{.underline}e. Our personal emphasis on the ways we are
marginalized often matches the world as we have experienced it. And such
a focus may be in some ways convenient for the practitioners of
deference epistemology. Nonetheless, I still think that the cynical view
does them too little credit. Many who practice deference epistemology
are simply doing the best they can. However, this same phenomenon also
illustrates how the strength of standpoint epistemology, its recognition
of the importance of perspective, becomes its weakness when flattened
into deference politics. From [a structural perspective, the rooms we
don\'t enter, the experiences we don\'t have]{.underline} (and the
reasons we are able to avoid them) [might have more to teach us about
the world and our place in it than anything said inside. If so, the
deferential approach to standpoint epistemology actually prevents
\"centering]{.underline}\" or even hearing from the most marginalized,
[since it focuses us on the interactions inside the rooms we occupy,
rather than calling us to account for the interactions we needn\'t and
typically don\'t have]{.underline}. For those who are deferred to, the
performance of deference can supercharge group-undermining norms. In her
book Conflict Is Not Abuse, activist writer and scholar Sarah Schulman
makes a provocative observation about the psychological effects of both
trauma and felt superiority: while these often come about for different
reasons and have very different moral statuses, they result in similar
behavioral patterns. Chief among these are misrepresenting the stakes of
conflict (often by overstating harm) and representing others\'
independence as a hostile threat (for example, calling out failures to
\"center\" the right topics or people). These behaviors, whatever their
causal history, have corrosive effects, especially when a community\'s
norms magnify or multiply rather than constrain or metabolize them. For
those who defer, the habit can supercharge moral cowardice, as the norms
of deference provide social cover for the abdication of responsibility.
It displaces onto individual heroes, a hero class, or a mythicized past
the work that is ours to do in the present. Their perspective may be
clearer on this or that specific matter, but their overall point of view
isn\'t any less particular or constrained by history than ours. [More
importantly, deference places the accountability that is all of ours to
bear onto select people-and, more often than not, a sanitized and
thoroughly fictional caricature of them. Deference to
collectives]{.underline} or their culture [has many of the same risks as
deference to marginalized individual.]{.underline} PAIGC militant
Amílcar Cabral affirmed the need to respond to centuries of anti-Black
racism and the widespread assumptions about the inferiority of African
history and culture. He, of course, denied that anything like a single
African culture existed. [But even if it did, reference to it would not
answer questions about how we ought to behave and organize ourselves
politically]{.underline}, since \"all culture is composed of essential
and secondary elements, of strengths and weaknesses, of virtues and
failings, of positive and negative aspects, of factors of progress and
factors of stagnation or regression.\" He went as far as to insist that
\"blind acceptance of the values of the culture, without considering
what presently or potentially regressive elements it contains\" would be
\"no less harmful to Africa\" than racist underestimation of African
culture had been. 28 The [same tactics of deference that insulate us
from criticism and disagreement insulate us from connection and
transformation.]{.underline} They [prevent us from engaging
empathetically and authentically with the struggles of other
people]{.underline}---a prerequisite of coalitional politics. Moreover,
[as identities become more and more fine grained]{.underline} and
disagreements sharper, we come to realize that \"[coalitional
politics]{.underline}\" (understood as struggle across difference) is[,
simply, politics. Thus, the deferential orientation, like that
fragmentation of political collectivity it enables, is ultimately
anti-political]{.underline} To opt for [deference]{.underline}, rather
than interdependence, [may soothe short-term psychological
wounds]{.underline}. But it does so at a steep cost: i[t may undermine
the goals that motivated the project---and it entrenches a politics that
does not serve those fighting for freedom over privilege]{.underline},
for collective liberation over mere parochial advantage.

[Deference politics is right about the what]{.underline}: it does in
fact matter that we pay attention to lived experiences, and it is
politically important that we pay attention to difference. But it is
[wrong about the how]{.underline}, because the [more we focus on
changing our norms of interactions]{.underline} to ones that locally and
cosmetically elevate the voices and perspectives in the room, the
[harder it becomes to change the world outside of the room]{.underline}.
As philosopher C. Thi Nguyen reminded us in the last chapter, the power
of the system is that of the game designer. It builds our social,
economic, cultural, and even attentional environment in ways that get us
to follow its game plan. In the speech I quoted at the beginning of this
chapter, Amílcar Cabral explains another important aspect of this
systemic control: \"\[[Imperialist domination\... for its own security,
requires cultural oppression]{.underline} and the attempt at direct or
indirect liquidation of the essential elements of the culture of the
dominated people.\" Culture, for Cabral, is our [collective ability to
design and organize our own lives]{.underline}, and be the engines of
our own history-an ability that [conflicts directly with the aims of
imperialists to be the ones doing the designing and
controlling]{.underline}. This is why, \"whatever may be the material
aspects of this domination,\" [imperialist domination can survive \"only
by the permanent, organized repression of the cultural life]{.underline}
of the people concerned. »29 This, above all, [illustrates the key
problem with deference: it focuses the very capacity]{.underline} that
we have to reconstruct the whole house to the specific rooms that have
already been built for us. It [advertises itself as deferring to
marginalized voices and perspectives, but in conceding so much creative
space to the blueprint of societ]{.underline}y, it is perhaps better
understood as deference to the built structure of society. I am arguing
here for another approach-one that concedes that we have to start with
the interactions that we have most control over, but that keeps in view
the point of changing how those interactions go: to rebuild the whole of
society, not just our interactions. [Rooting ourselves here thus gives
us a constructive politics]{.underline}. A [constructive politics
pursues specific goals or end results,]{.underline} [rather than aiming
to avoid \"complicity\"]{.underline} in injustices that we assume will
mostly persist anyway. I[f it\'s \"epistemology\" or knowledge practices
we\'re concerned about,]{.underline} then a [constructive politics
focuses on institutions]{.underline} and practices of [information
gathering that are strategically useful for challenging social
injustices themselves]{.underline}, not just the symptoms manifest in
the room we happen to be in today. [In general, a constructive politics
is one that engages directly]{.underline} in the task of redistributing
social resources and power, rather than pursuing intermediary goals
cashed out in symbols. [This is a demanding approach]{.underline}. It
asks that we swim upstream, that we be accountable and responsive to
people who aren\'t yet in the room, and that we build the kinds of rooms
in which we can sit together, rather than merely seek to navigate more
gracefully the rooms history has built for us. The [task of rebuilding
the world is demanding--- and it\'s constructive politics, not
deferential politics, that brings these demands together.]{.underline}

#### Turns exhaustion. Their politics pedestalizes the oppressed and causes them to bear trauma by themselves -- that causes their struggles to become performances for the benefit of elites.

**Táíwò, 22**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity
Politics (and Everything Else), What the Constructive Approach Asks of
Us, 35, ZMR

The [constructive approach is, however, extremely
demanding]{.underline}. It asks us to be planners and designers, to be
accountable and responsive to people who aren't yet in the room. In
addition to being architects, it asks us to become builders and
construction workers: to actually build the kinds of rooms we could sit
in together, rather than idly speculate about which rooms would be nice.
But it's [important to]{.underline} acknowledge, in closing this book,
that the constructive approach has implicit moral and emotional demands,
as well: we can neither plan nor build a better world without
collectively cultivating diverse kinds of moral and emotional
discipline. "[The deferential approach to politics is worth praising
because of its concern and attention to the importance of lived
experience]{.underline}---especially traumatic experiences. But just as
this [virtue becomes a vice when being in the room" effects are
ignored,]{.underline} this [virtue also becomes a vice when trauma's
importance]{.underline} and prevalence are framed as positive bases for
social credentials and deference behaviors, rather than primarily as
problems to deal with collectively. Here, scholarly analysis and
argument fail me. The remainder of what I have to say skews more toward
conviction than contention. But life has taught me that conviction has
much to teach, however differently posed or processed, and so I press
on. I take concerns about trauma especially seriously. I grew up in the
United States, a nation structured by settler colonialism, racial
slavery, and their aftermath, with enough collective and historical
trauma to go around. I also grew up in a Nigerian diasporic community,
populated by many who had genocide in their living memory. At the
national and community level, I have seen personality traits, quirks of
habit and action, that I've suspected were born of these grim parts of
history. Like most people, I have not been spared. I've watched and felt
myself change in reaction to fearing for my dignity or life, to crushing
pain and humiliation. I [reflect on these traumatic moments often, and
very seldom do I think, "That was educational]{.underline}." These
[experiences can be, if we are very fortunate, building
blocks]{.underline}. What comes of them depends on how the blocks are
put together. Those who study the politics of knowledge call this the
"achievement thesis." As philosopher Briana Toole clarifies, by itself,
one's social location only puts a person in a position to know;
"epistemic privilege" or advantage, on the other hand, is achieved only
through deliberate, concerted struggle from that position.8 Humiliation,
deprivation, and suffering can build---especially in the context of the
deliberate, structured effort of "consciousness raising" that Toole
specifically highlights. But these same experiences can also destroy,
and if I had to bet on which effect would win most often, it would be
the latter. Contra the old expression, pain, whether born of oppression
or not, is a poor teacher. [Suffering is partial, shortsighted, and
self-absorbed. We shouldn't have a politics that expects
different]{.underline}. Oppression is not a prep school. [Demanding as
the constructive approach may be, the deferential approach is far more
so, and in a far more unfair way]{.underline}. As philosopher Agnes
Callard rightly notes, trauma (and even the righteous, well-deserved
anger that often accompanies it) [can corrupt as readily as it can
ennoble]{.underline}.9 Perhaps more so. [When it comes down to it, the
thing I believe most deeply about deference politics is that it
asks]{.underline} something of trauma that it cannot give. It asks the
[traumatized to shoulder burdens alone that we ought to share
collectively, lifting them up onto a pedestal in order to hide below
them]{.underline}. When I think about my trauma, I don't think about
life lessons. I think about the quiet nobility of survival. The very
fact that those chapters weren't the final ones of my story is powerful
enough all on its own. It is enough to ask of those experiences that I
am still here to remember them. I also believe that deference politics
asks us to be less than we are---and not even for our own benefit. As
scholar-activist Nick Estes explains in the context of Indigenous
politics, "The [cunning of trauma politics is that it turns actual
people and struggles]{.underline}, whether racial or Indigenous
citizenship and belonging[, into matters of injury]{.underline}. It
[defines an entire people mostly on their trauma and not by their
aspirations or sheer humanity]{.underline}." [This
performance]{.underline} is not for the benefit of Indigenous people;
rather, "[it's for white audiences or institutions of
power]{.underline}."10 When I think about my trauma, I also think about
the great writer James Baldwin's realization that the things that most
tormented him "were the very things that connected me with all the
people who were alive, or who had ever been alive."11That I have
experienced my share of [traumatic experiences]{.underline}, have
survived abuse of various kinds, have faced near death from accidental
circumstance and from violence (different as the particulars of these
may be from those around me) [is not a card to play in gamified social
interaction or a weapon to wield in battles over prestig]{.underline}e.
It [is not what gives]{.underline} me [a special right to speak, to
evaluate, or to decide for a group]{.underline}. It is a concrete,
experiential manifestation of the vulnerability that connects me to most
of the people on this earth. It comes between me and other people not as
a wall, but as a bridge. Going together---[the politics of
solidarity,]{.underline} which deference provides one, flawed model of
doing---is a good start. But [on its own, it's not enough]{.underline}.
We also have to decide collectively where we're going, and then we have
to do what it takes to get there. Though we start from different levels
of privilege or advantage, this journey is not a matter of figuring out
who should bow to whom, but simply one of figuring out how best to join
forces. As Paulo Freire showed us in theory, and the African
anti-colonial and Portuguese Carnation revolutions showed us in
practice[, we will need each other to get where we're going. And getting
there, after all, is the point.]{.underline}

#### Deference epistemologies are [worse]{.underline} for community formation, [reify]{.underline} trauma, and actively [strengthen]{.underline} hegemonic structures by marginalizing the people who [were never here to defer to in the first place]{.underline}.

**Táíwò, 20**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, "Being-in-the-Room Privilege: Elite Capture and
Epistemic Deference," The Philosopher, vol. 108, no. 4, dml)

I think it's less about the core ideas and more about the prevailing
norms that convert them into practice. The call to "listen to the most
affected" or "centre the most marginalized" is ubiquitous in many
academic and activist circles. But it's never sat well with me. In my
experience, [[when people say]{.mark} they need to ["**listen to the
most affected**", it]{.mark} isn't because they intend to set up **Skype
calls to refugee camps** or to **collaborate with houseless
people**]{.underline}. Instead, [it has more [often meant]{.mark}
handing **[conversational authority]{.mark}** and **attentional goods**
to those who **most snugly fit** into the social categories associated
with these ills -- **regardless** of what they actually **do** o0r **do
not know**, or what they **have** or **have not personally
experienced**]{.underline}. In the case of my conversation with Helen,
my racial category tied me more "authentically" to an experience that
neither of us had had. She was called to defer to me by the rules of the
game as we understood it. Even where stakes are high -- where potential
researchers are discussing how to understand a social phenomenon, where
activists are deciding what to target -- these rules often prevail.

The trap wasn't that standpoint epistemology was affecting the
conversation, but how. Broadly, [the norms]{.underline} of putting
standpoint epistemology into practice [[call for]{.mark} practices of
**[deference]{.mark}**: **giving offerings**, **passing the mic**,
**believing**]{.underline}. These are good ideas in many cases, and the
norms that ask us to be ready to do them stem from admirable
motivations: a desire to increase the social power of marginalized
people identified as sources of knowledge and rightful targets of
deferential behaviour. But [deferring in this way [as a]{.mark} **rule**
or [**default political orientation**]{.mark} can actually work
**[counter]{.mark}** to [marginalized groups' interests,]{.mark}
especially [in **elite spaces**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Some rooms have **outsize**]{.mark} **power** and
**[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the Situation Room, the newsroom,
the bargaining table, the conference room. [[Being in these rooms means
being in a position to **affect institutions**]{.mark} and **broader
social dynamics** by way of deciding what one is to say and do.
[Access]{.mark} to these rooms [is itself a]{.mark} kind of **[social
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and one often gained through some
prior social advantage. From a societal standpoint, [the "**most
affected**" by]{.underline} the [social injustices]{.underline} we
associate with politically important identities like gender, class,
race, and nationality [are **disproportionately likely** to
be]{.underline} incarcerated, underemployed, or part of the 44 percent
of the world's population without internet access -- and thus [both
**left out** of the rooms of power and **largely ignored** by the people
in the rooms of power]{.underline}. [[Individuals]{.mark} who make it
past]{.underline} the various **[social selection
pressures]{.underline}** that filter out those social identities
associated with these negative outcomes are most likely to be in the
room. That is, [they [are most likely to be in the]{.mark} [room]{.mark}
precisely [because of ways]{.mark} in which [they are]{.mark}
[**systematically different** from]{.mark} (and thus potentially
**unrepresentative** of) [the]{.mark} very [people they]{.mark} are then
**asked to [represent]{.mark}** in the room]{.underline}.

I suspected that Helen's offer was a trap. She was not the one who set
it, but it threatened to ensnare us both all the same. Broader cultural
norms -- the sort set in motion by prefacing statements with "As a Black
man..." -- cued up a set of standpoint-respecting practices that many of
us know consciously or unconsciously by rote. However, [the forms of
[deference]{.mark}]{.underline} that often follow [are ultimately
**self-undermining** and only reliably [serve "**elite
capture**]{.mark}": the control over **political agendas** and
**resources** by a group's **most advantaged** people. If we want
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} use standpoint epistemology to
[**[challenge]{.mark}** [unjust]{.mark} power [arrangements, it's **hard
to imagine** how we could do **worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To say what's wrong with the popular, deferential applications of
standpoint epistemology, we need to understand what makes it popular. A
number of cynical answers present themselves: some (especially the more
socially advantaged) don't genuinely want social change -- they just
want the appearance of it. Alternatively, deference to figures from
oppressed communities is a performance that sanitizes, apologizes for,
or simply distracts from the fact that the deferrer has enough "in the
room" privilege for their "lifting up" of a perspective to be of
consequence.

I suspect there is some truth to these views, but I am unsatisfied. Many
of the people who support and enact these deferential norms are rather
like Helen: motivated by the right reasons, but trusting people they
share such rooms with to help them find the proper practical expression
of their joint moral commitments. We don't need to attribute bad faith
to all or even most of those who interpret standpoint epistemology
deferentially to explain the phenomenon, and it's not even clear it
would help. Bad "roommates" aren't the problem for the same reason that
Helen being a good roommate wasn't the solution: the problem emerges
from how the rooms themselves are constructed and managed.

To return to the initial example with Helen, the issue wasn't merely
that I hadn't grown up in the kind of low-income, redlined community she
was imagining. The epistemic situation was much worse than this. Many of
the facts about me that made my life chances different from those of the
people she was imagining were the very same facts that made me likely to
be offered things on their behalf. If I had grown up in such a
community, we probably wouldn't have been on the phone together.

Many aspects of our social system serve as filtering mechanisms,
determining which interactions happen and between whom, and thus which
social patterns people are in a position to observe. For the majority of
the 20th century, the U.S. quota system of immigration made legal
immigration with a path to citizenship almost exclusively available to
Europeans (earning Hitler's regard as the obvious "leader in developing
explicitly racist policies of nationality and immigration"). But the
1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration
possibilities, with a preference for "skilled labour".

My parents' qualification as skilled labourers does much to explain
their entry into the country and the subsequent class advantages and
monetary resources (such as wealth) that I was born into. We are not
atypical: the Nigerian-American population is one of the country's most
successful immigrant populations (what no one mentions, of course, is
that the 112,000 or so Nigerian-Americans with advanced degrees is
utterly dwarfed by the 82 million Nigerians who live on less than a
dollar a day, or how the former fact intersects with the latter). The
selectivity of immigration law helps explain the rates of educational
attainment of the Nigerian diasporic community that raised me, which in
turn helps explain my entry into the exclusive Advanced Placement and
Honours classes in high school, which in turn helps explain my access to
higher education\...and so on, and so on.

It is easy, then, to see how [this deferential form]{.underline} of
standpoint epistemology [contributes to elite capture at **scale**. The
rooms of power and influence are at the end of causal chains that have
**selection effects**. [As you get]{.mark} higher and [higher]{.mark}
forms of [education]{.mark}, [social experiences **narrow**]{.mark} --
[some students are pipelined to **PhDs** and others to
**prisons**]{.mark}. Deferential ways of dealing with identity can
**inherit** the distortions caused by these selection
processes]{.underline}.

​[But it's equally easy to see locally]{.underline} -- in this room, in
this academic literature or field, in this conversation -- why [this
deference]{.underline} seems to make sense. It is often an improvement
on the epistemic procedure that preceded it: the person deferred to may
well be better epistemically positioned than the others in the room. It
[may well be the **best we can do** while holding **fixed** most of the
facts about the rooms themselves: what power resides in them, who is
admitted]{.underline}.

[But these are the **last** facts we should want to hold
fixed]{.underline}. Doing better than the epistemic norms we've
inherited from a history of explicit global apartheid is an awfully low
bar to set. [The facts that explain [who ends up in which room]{.mark}
[shape our world]{.mark} **much [more powerfully]{.mark}** [than]{.mark}
the squabbles for **[comparative prestige]{.mark}** between people who
have already made it into the rooms. And when the conversation is about
social justice, the mechanisms of the social system that determine who
gets into which room often just are the parts of society we aim to
address]{.underline}. For example, the fact that incarcerated people
cannot participate in academic discussions about freedom that physically
take place on campus is intimately related to the fact that they are
locked in cages.

[[Deference epistemology]{.mark} marks itself as a **solution** to an
epistemic and political problem. But not only does it [**fail** to solve
these problems,]{.mark} it **adds new ones**]{.underline}. One might
think [questions of justice ought to be primarily concerned with fixing
disparities around **health care**, **working conditions**, and **basic
material** and **interpersonal security**. Yet
conversations]{.underline} about justice [have come to be shaped by
people who have **ever more specific practical advice** about fixing the
**distribution of attention** and **conversational power**.
[Deference]{.mark} practices that serve **attention-focused
[campaigns]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. we've read too many white men,
let's now read some people of colour) [can **fail** on their own
**highly questionable** terms: attention to **spokespeople** from
marginalized groups could]{.underline}, for example, [**[direct
attention]{.mark} [away]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the need to change
[the]{.mark} **social [system]{.mark}** []{.mark}that marginalizes
them.]{.underline}

[Elites from marginalized groups can **benefit** from this arrangement
in ways that are **compatible** with social progress. But treating group
elites' interests as **necessarily** or even **presumptively aligned**
with full group interests involves a **political naiveté** we cannot
afford. [Such treatment of elite interests functions as a **racial
Reaganomics**]{.mark}: a strategy [reliant on **fantasies**]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} the [exchange]{.mark} rate [between]{.mark} the
[attention]{.mark} economy [and]{.mark} the [material
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Perhaps the lucky few]{.mark} who get jobs finding the **most
culturally authentic** and **cosmetically radical description** of the
continuing carnage [are]{.mark} really **[winning one for the
culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Then[, after we]{.mark} in the
chattering class get the **clout we deserve** and [**secure the bag**,
it]{.mark}s contents [will eventually **trickle down** to]{.mark} the
[workers who **clean up after our conferences**]{.mark}, to **slums of
the Global South's megacities**, to its **countryside**.]{.underline}

**[[But probably not]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A fuller and fairer assessment of what is going on with deference and
standpoint epistemology would go beyond technical argument, and contend
with the emotional appeals of this strategy of deference. Those in
powerful rooms may be "elites" relative to the larger group they
represent, but this guarantees nothing about how they are treated in the
rooms they are in. After all, a person privileged in an absolute sense
(a person belonging to, say, the half of the world that has secure
access to "basic needs") may nevertheless feel themselves to be
consistently on the low end of the power dynamics they actually
experience. [Deference epistemology]{.underline} responds to real,
morally weighty experiences of being put down, ignored, sidelined, or
silenced. It thus [has an important non-epistemic appeal to members
of]{.underline} stigmatized [or marginalized groups: it **intervenes
directly** in morally consequential practices of giving attention and
respect]{.underline}.

The social dynamics we experience have an outsize role in developing and
refining our political subjectivity, and our sense of ourselves. But
[this]{.underline} very [strength]{.underline} of standpoint
epistemology -- [its recognition of the importance of perspective --
becomes its **weakness** when combined with **deferential practical
norms**. Emphasis on the ways we are marginalized often matches the
world as we have experienced it. But, from a structural perspective, the
rooms we **never needed to enter** (and the explanations of why we can
**avoid** these rooms) might have **more to teach us** about the world
and our place in it. If so, [the deferential approach]{.mark} to
standpoint epistemology actually [**prevents** "**centring**]{.mark}" or
even **hearing** from [the most marginalized; it]{.mark}
[**focuses**]{.mark} us [on the]{.mark} interaction of the [rooms we
**occupy**]{.mark}, [rather than]{.mark} calling us to account for the
[interactions we **don't experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This fact
about who is in the room, combined with the fact that speaking for
others generates its own set of important problems (particularly when
they are not there to advocate for themselves), eliminates pressures
that might otherwise trouble the centrality of our own suffering -- and
of the suffering of the marginalized people that do happen to make it
into rooms with us.

[The dangers with this feature of deference politics are **grave**, as
are the risks for those outside of the most powerful rooms. For those
who are **deferred to**, it can supercharge **group-undermining
norms**]{.underline}. In Conflict is Not Abuse, Sarah Schulman makes a
provocative observation about the psychological effects of [both trauma
and felt superiority]{.underline}: [while these]{.underline} often [come
about for different reasons]{.underline} and have very different moral
statuses, [they result in similar behavioural patterns. Chief among
these are [**misrepresenting** the]{.mark} stakes of [conflict]{.mark}
(often by **overstating harm**) or representing others' independence as
a **hostile threat** ([such as failures to "**centre**" the **right
topics**]{.mark} or **people**). These behaviours, whatever their causal
history, [have **corrosive effects**]{.mark} on individuals who perform
them as well as the groups around them, **[especially when]{.mark} a
[community]{.mark}'s [norms magnify]{.mark}** or **multiply** [these
behaviours]{.mark} rather than **constraining** or **metabolizing**
them]{.underline}.

[For those who **defer**, the habit can supercharge **moral cowardice**.
The norms [provide]{.mark} social [cover for the **abdication of
responsibility**]{.mark}: it displaces onto **individual
heroes**]{.underline}, a hero class, or a mythicized past [the work that
is **ours** to do **now** in the present. Their perspective may be
clearer on **this** or **that specific matter**, but their **overall**
point of view isn't **any less particular** or **constrained** by
history than ours]{.underline}. More importantly, [deference places the
accountability that is **all of ours** to bear onto **select people** --
[and]{.mark}, more often than not, [a **hyper-sanitized**]{.mark} and
**thoroughly fictional [caricature]{.mark}** of them]{.underline}.

The same [tactics of deference]{.underline} that insulate us from
criticism also [**insulate** us from **connection** and
**transformation**. They **prevent** us from engaging **empathetically**
and **authentically** with the struggles of other people]{.underline} --
prerequisites of coalitional politics. [As identities become **more**
and **more fine-grained** and **disagreements sharper**, we come to
realize that "**coalitional politics**"]{.underline} (understood as
**[struggle across difference]{.underline}**) [is, simply, **politics**.
Thus, the deferential orientation, like that **fragmentation** of
political collectivity it enables, is ultimately
**anti-political**]{.underline}.

[[Deference]{.mark} rather than interdependence [may **soothe short-term
psychological wounds**]{.mark}. [But]{.mark} it does so [at a **steep
cost**]{.mark}: [it can **undermine**]{.mark} the [epistemic goals that
**motivate**]{.mark} the project, and it entrenches a politics
**unbefitting** of anyone [fighting for **freedom**]{.mark} [rather
than]{.mark} for **[privilege]{.mark}**, for **collective liberation**
rather than mere **parochial advantage**]{.underline}.

How would a constructive approach to putting standpoint epistemology
into practice differ from a deferential approach? [A constructive
approach would [focus on]{.mark} the pursuit of **[specific
goals]{.mark}** or **end results** [rather than avoiding
"**complicity**]{.mark}" in injustice [or]{.mark} adhering to **[moral
principles]{.mark}**. It would be concerned **primarily with building
institutions** and cultivating practices of **information-gathering**
rather than **helping**]{.underline}. It would focus on accountability
rather than conformity. [It would calibrate itself **directly** to the
task of **redistributing social resources** and **power** rather than to
**intermediary goals** cashed out in terms [of **pedestals** or
**symbolism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would focus on building and
rebuilding rooms, not regulating traffic within and between them -- it
would be a world-making project: aimed at building and rebuilding actual
structures of social connection and movement, rather than mere critique
of the ones we already have.

The water crisis in Flint, Michigan presents a clear example of both the
possibilities and limitations of refining our epistemic politics in this
way. Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), a government
body tasked with the support of "healthy communities", with a team of
fifty trained scientists at its disposal, was complicit in covering up
the scale and gravity of the public health crisis from the beginning of
the crisis in 2014 until it garnered national attention in 2015.

The MDEQ, speaking from a position of epistemic and political authority,
defended the status quo in Flint. They claimed that "Flint water is safe
to drink", and were cited in Flint Mayor Dayne Walling's statement
aiming to "dispel myths and promote the truth about the Flint River"
during the April 2014 transition to the Flint River water source. That
transition was spearheaded under the tenure of the city's emergency
manager Darnell Earley (an African-American, like many of the city
residents he helped to poison). After the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) circulated a leaked internal memo from the federal Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) in July of 2014 expressing concern about lead in
Flint water, the MDEQ produced a doctored report that put the overall
measure of lead levels within federally mandated levels by mysteriously
failing to count two contaminated samples.

The reaction from residents was immediate. The month after the switch in
water source, residents reported that their tap water was discoloured
and gave off an alarming odour. They didn't need their oppression to be
"celebrated", "centred", or narrated in the newest academic parlance.
They didn't need someone to understand what it felt like to be poisoned.
What they needed was the lead out of their water. So they got to work.

The first step was to develop epistemic authority. To achieve this they
built a new room: one that put Flint residents and activists in active
collaboration with scientists who had the laboratories that could run
the relevant tests and prove the MDEQ's report to be fraudulent. Flint
residents' outcry recruited scientists to their cause and led a "citizen
science" campaign, further raising the alarm about the water quality and
distributing sample kits to neighbours to submit for testing. In this
stage, the alliance of residents and scientists won, and the poisoning
of the children of Flint emerged as a national scandal.

But this was not enough. The second step -- cleaning the water --
required more than state acknowledgement: it required apportioning
labour and resources to fix the water and address the continuing health
concerns. What Flint residents received, initially, was a mix of
platitudes and mockery from the ruling elite (some of this personally
committed by a President that shared a racial identity with many of
them). This year, however, it looks as though the tireless activism of
Flint residents and their expanding list of teammates has won additional
and more meaningful victories: the ongoing campaign is pushing the
replacements of the problematic service lines to their final stage and
is forcing the state of Michigan to agree to a settlement of \$600
million for affected families.

This outcome is in no way a wholesale victory: not only will attorney
fees cut a substantial portion of payouts, but the settlement cannot
undo the damage that was caused to the residents. A constructive
epistemology cannot guarantee full victory over an oppressive system by
itself. No epistemic orientation can by itself undo the various power
asymmetries between the people and the imperial state system. But it can
help make the game a little more competitive -- and deference
epistemology isn't even playing.

[The **biggest threats** to social justice attention and informational
economies are **not the absence of yet more jargon** to describe, ever
more precisely or incisively, the]{.underline} epistemic, attentional,
or interpersonal [**afflictions** of the disempowered. The biggest
threats are the **erosion** of the **practical** and **material bases**
for popular power]{.underline} over knowledge production and
distribution, particularly that [which could **aid effective political
action** and **constrain** or **eliminate predation** by elites. The
**capture** and **corruption** of these bases by well-positioned
elites]{.underline}, especially tech corporations, [goes on **unabated**
and largely **unchallenged**]{.underline}, including: the corporate
monopolization of local news, the ongoing destruction and looting of the
journalistic profession, the interference of corporations and
governments in key democratic processes, and the domination of elite
interests in the production of knowledge by research universities and
the circulation of the output of these distorted processes by
established media organizations.

Confronting these threats requires leaving some rooms -- and building
new ones.

[[The constructive approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to standpoint
epistemology is demanding. It [[asks]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} **swim
upstream**: to [be]{.mark} **[accountable]{.mark}** and **responsive**
[to people who **aren't yet in the room**]{.mark}, to build the kinds of
rooms we could **sit in together**]{.underline}, rather than merely
judiciously navigating the rooms history has built for us. But this
weighty demand is par for the course when it comes to the politics of
knowledge: the American philosopher Sandra Harding famously pointed out
that standpoint epistemology, properly understood, demands more rigour
from science and knowledge production processes generally, not less.

But one important topic stands unaddressed. [[The deferential
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} to standpoint epistemology [[often comes
packaged]{.mark} [with]{.mark} concern and attention to the importance
of **lived experience**]{.underline}. Among these, [**[traumatic
experiences]{.mark}** are especially foregrounded]{.underline}.

At this juncture, scholarly analysis and argument fail me. The remainder
of what I have to say skews more towards conviction than contention. But
the life of books has taught me that conviction has just as much to
teach, however differently posed or processed, and so I press on.

[[I take]{.mark} concerns about trauma **especially
[seriously]{.mark}**. I grew up in the United States, a nation
structured by [**settler colonialism**, **racial slavery**, and their
aftermath]{.mark}]{.underline}, with enough collective and historical
trauma to go round. [I also grew up in a Nigerian diasporic community,
populated by many who had **genocide in living memory**]{.underline}. At
the national and community level, I have seen a lot of traits of norms,
personality, quirks of habit and action that I've suspected were
downstream of these facts. At the level of individual experience, [I've
watched and felt myself change in reaction to fearing for my dignity or
life, to crushing pain and humiliation. [I reflect on]{.mark} these
[traumatic]{.mark} [moments]{.mark} **often**, [and **very seldom
think**: "**That was educational**]{.mark}".]{.underline}

These experiences can be, if we are very fortunate, building blocks.
What comes of them depends on how the blocks are put together: what
standpoint epistemologists call the "achievement thesis". Briana Toole
clarifies that, by itself, one's social location only puts a person in a
position to know. "Epistemic privilege" or advantage is achieved only
through deliberate, concerted struggle from that position.

I concede outright that this is certainly one possible result of the
experience of oppression: have no doubt that humiliation, deprivation,
and suffering can build (especially in the context of the deliberate,
structured effort of "consciousness raising", as Toole specifically
highlights). But these same experiences can also destroy, and if I had
to bet on which effect would win most often, it would be the latter. As
Agnes Callard rightly notes, trauma (and even the righteous,
well-deserved anger that often accompanies it) can corrupt as readily as
it can ennoble. Perhaps more so.

Contra the old expression, pain -- whether borne of oppression or not --
is a poor teacher. Suffering is partial, short-sighted, and
self-absorbed. We shouldn't have a politics that expects different:
oppression is not a prep school.

When it comes down to it, the thing I believe most deeply about
[[deference epistemology]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [asks something
of trauma that it **cannot give**]{.underline}. Demanding as the
constructive approach may be, [the deferential approach]{.underline} is
far more demanding and in a far more unfair way: it [asks the
traumatized to shoulder burdens **alone** that we ought to share
**collectively**]{.underline}. When I think about my trauma, I don't
think about grand lessons. I think about the quiet nobility of survival.
The very fact that those chapters weren't the final ones of my story is
powerful enough writing all on its own. It is enough to ask of those
experiences that I am still here to remember them.

[Deference epistemology asks us to be **less** than we are -- and not
even for our **own** benefit]{.underline}. As Nick Estes explains in the
context of Indigenous politics: "[The **cunning** of trauma politics is
that it turns **actual people** and **struggles**]{.underline}, whether
racial or Indigenous citizenship and belonging, [into matters of
**injury**. It [**defines an entire people**]{.mark} mostly [on their
**trauma**]{.mark} and not by their **aspirations** or **sheer
humanity**]{.underline}". [This performance is]{.underline} not for the
benefit of Indigenous people, but "[[for **white audiences**]{.mark} or
**institutions of power**]{.underline}".

I also think about James Baldwin's realization that the things that
tormented him the most were "the very things that connected me with all
the people who were alive, who had ever been alive". [That I have
**survived abuse** of various kinds, have faced **near-death** from both
accidental circumstance and violence]{.underline} (different as the
particulars of these may be from those around me) [is **[not a card to
play]{.mark} in gamified social interaction** or a **weapon to wield in
[battles over prestige]{.mark}**. It is **not** what gives me a
**special right to speak**, to **evaluate**, or to **decide for a
group**. It is a concrete, experiential manifestation of the
**vulnerability** that connects me to most of the people on this Earth.
It comes between me and other people not as a **wall**, but as a
**bridge**]{.underline}.

**Táíwò, 22**---assistant professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University (Olúfémi, Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity
Politics (and Everything Else), Getting out the Hammers, 33, ZMR

We are [seeing the corporate monopolization]{.underline} of local news
and social media, the ongoing destruction and looting [of the
journalistic profession]{.underline}, and the [domination of elite
interests]{.underline} in the production of knowledge by research
universities and think tanks. But, as the long history of muckraking,
abolitionist newspapers, consciousness raising, and political education
campaigns shows, information networks aid effective political action and
can constrain the system's violence. [Many people are hard at
work]{.underline} developing their twenty-first-century analogues,
[building strong networks for movement journalism,]{.underline}
encouraging adoption of alternative social media platforms, and
increasing the research capacity of left organizations. They [deserve
and need our support. Rules and procedures can help keep these ventures
stable and well directed.]{.underline} But Robert's Rules of Order
cannot do much to constrain toxic organizing cultures. We will have to
think more comprehensively. In a speech describing social movements like
the anti-imperialist struggles he was then fighting against the
Portuguese Empire, Cabral observed that "national liberation is
necessarily an act of culture."70 By "culture," Cabral did not mean that
a carefully curated list of customary greetings, traditional foods, and
styles of dress were themselves going to bring down the military forces
of a fascist empire. Culture is "the vigorous manifestation on the
ideological or idealist plane" of people and "a product of their
history," Cabral observed. But he also insisted that culture is not just
an idle ideological force or set of fashions and preferences that
results from past and present trends; it is also "a determinant of
history, by the positive or negative influence which it exerts on the
evolution of relationships between man and his environment." This is why
he claimed that imperialist domination "can be maintained only by the
permanent, organized repression of the cultural life of the people
concerned." After all, if [people are in the habit of determining for
themselves how to organiz]{.underline}e more of their lives than they
are currently allowed to, cunning [imperialists understand that the
colonized might eventually go for the whole pie]{.underline}. In this
sense, then, the struggle for national liberation was simply "the
organized political expression of the culture of the people who are
undertaking the struggle."71 We should [put our cultural norms to the
same constructive test as our other goals and aspirations]{.underline}:
"The important thing is to [proceed to critical analysis]{.underline} of
African cultures in relation to the liberation movement and [to the
exigencies of progress.]{.underline}" That is, [we should evaluate our
culture instrumentally, by how well it helps us build what we are trying
to build.]{.underline}72 A [constructive political culture would focus
on outcome]{.underline} over process---the [pursuit of specific goals or
end results rather than]{.underline} avoiding [complicity in injustice
or promoting purely moral or aesthetic principles]{.underline}. When it
comes to knowledge and information, we [should be concerned]{.underline}
primarily [with building institutions]{.underline} and campaign-relevant
practices of information gathering [and sharing rather than centering
specific groups of people]{.underline} or spokespeople who stand in for
them. And we should [calibrate our program directly to the task of
redistributing social resources]{.underline} and power rather than to
pedestals, attention, or symbolism. [We need to focus on building and
rebuilding rooms, not on regulating traffic within and between
them.]{.underline} This is a world-making project aimed at building and
rebuilding actual structures of social connection and movement, not mere
critique of the ones we already have. We [should set our sights on
different scales]{.underline}, from local fights like community control
over land, housing, and energy [to global ones over debt cancellation in
the global South]{.underline}. These [fights,]{.underline} especially
[when they are planetary in scope, make it possible to totally revamp
our global social system]{.underline}---to rebuild the house we all live
in together.

**[Anti-Leadership Attitudes]{.underline}**

Definition

[Hold]{.underline}ing [[skepticism of leadership as a
**rule**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Questioning the authority, legitimacy,
and competence of those with positional, perceived, or other forms of
power. Therefore, [all decisions made by leadership are subject to
**broad-based skepticism** and **mistrust**]{.underline}. Valuing
expertise and experience is challenged as potentially elitist.
Professionalization is cited as a problematic aspect of how leadership
and power are meted out. Anti-intellectualism is promoted as an
egalitarian appreciation of more informal forms of skill or knowledge.
This is not to be confused with a healthy skepticism of authority and
leadership, including within movement spaces.

Fallacies

To be clear, [abuse of authority]{.underline}, [corruption]{.underline},
[and the arbitrary concentration of power are real problems]{.underline}
that have gone unexamined in years past. We should credit those
people---many of them newer and younger to the work---who are shining a
light on systemic issues and the deep harm they cause to individuals and
the power we seek. However, [a reflexively anti-leadership orientation
[is an **overcorrection** that doesn't make room for]{.mark} the
existence of **[principled]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[responsive]{.underline}**, **[accountable]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[and **democratic** [leadership]{.mark} or for the ability of anyone in
a leadership position to build strong movements]{.underline},
organizations, or workplaces.

Social change work requires experience, rigor, and study. [It can take
**years** of development to grow into a skillful organizer]{.underline},
strategist, communicator, campaign manager, or facilitator. Although
talented people can rapidly develop skills, [many capacities only
develop over time]{.underline}. For example, judgment, relationship
building, emotional maturity, and landscape awareness (including the
knowledge of what you don't know) deepen with experience.

"**[[Professionalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[and experience
are]{.underline}]{.mark} two **[[different]{.underline}]{.mark}** things
that should not be conflated. [[Most organizers]{.mark} historically and
globally [have not been developed through professional
pipelines]{.mark}]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, [**[all]{.mark}**
skilled organizers]{.underline}---professional or otherwise---[[have
**rigorously honed**]{.mark} those [skills over time]{.mark} through
study and practice]{.underline}.

[[Pretending]{.mark} formal [leadership doesn't exist can **obscure
hierarchies** and create]{.mark} centers of **[informal
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Formal leadership]{.underline}]{.mark},
when healthy, [[provides **clarity** and **transparency**]{.underline},
[which leads to **greater accountability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[This]{.underline} in turn [fosters **more avenues for support** to
develop new leadership]{.underline}.

Finally, [there is a very real **intellectual** component to this
work]{.underline}. [[The idea that working people do not or cannot
engage in intellectual work is **truly elitist**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and has not been my experience.

Anti-Institutional Sentiment

Definition

Reflexively disdaining institutions and organizations as inherently
oppressive and antiquated, including the institution one may be
associated with. This point of view casts institutions themselves as the
problem, even those with a social change mission.

Fallacies

We all have examples of bloated, aimless, top-heavy, or simply
irrelevant institutions that take space, hoard power, and demonstrate
little impact. Even institutions that begin as disruptors of the status
quo can slow-walk toward conservatism, disconnection, bureaucracy,
irrelevance, and inefficiency. In fact, given the system of capitalism
our institutions are navigating, if we are not mindful of these
realities, we risk falling into them.

Despite those common pitfalls, [we need **institutions** for a
**powerful** and **durable** movement]{.underline}. [Organizations and
[institutions are **political vehicles**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They are
also spaces [where individuals develop **skills**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[connection]{.underline}**, [and **ideological
alignment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Institutions transmit
**knowledge**]{.underline}, [hold **strategy**]{.underline}, [and
cultivate **power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Atomized individuals that
loosely assemble **cannot do this at the scale needed**]{.mark} to take
on entrenched power]{.underline}.

[Arguing for doing away with political vehicles without offering a
**viable replacement** demonstrates a lack of a **power
analysis**]{.underline}. [The most [organized forces can **leverage
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [so how can our movements
**win**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in moments of crisis [if we]{.mark}
**relinquish** our organized vehicles?]{.underline} [When our opposition
possesses disciplined and organized institutions at the ready to **fill
power vacuums**]{.underline}, [what does it mean to [**unilaterally

At the height of the CPUSA's influence, Black comrades were leading
theoreticians and organizers, standing united with white workers and the
global proletariat against a common enemy. Jones was largely responding
to [the **[right-wing shift]{.mark}** in the Party's

shift [was largely the result of state repression and interference but
[was]{.mark} partly [driven by]{.mark} the resulting production of [a
tendency]{.mark}]{.underline} within the Party [[holding the struggle
**couldn't advance**]{.underline} "[until **all vestiges of white
chauvinism were driven** from the]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Party's\]
[[ranks]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Haywood 1978: 588). [Such [idealism
assumes we **first** create]{.mark} equality and [a utopian group
**before** engaging in struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [rather than
doing the work]{.underline}]{.mark} [of **struggling [together]{.mark}**
and **building together**]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
"phony war" on white chauvinism [had]{.underline} two [**devastating**
effects]{.underline}. First, [it [allowed]{.mark}]{.underline}
"[[leading white comrades to **abdicate**]{.mark} their
[responsibilities in fighting chauvinism and rallying]{.mark} white
workers in defense of Black rights]{.underline}" [while [producing a
culturalist tendency]{.mark} in [which]{.mark} white people **[couldn't
critique]{.mark}** Black comrades]{.underline}, [**[depriving]{.mark}**
Black revolutionaries of]{.underline} "[[the benefit of
**criticism**]{.mark} and **self-criticism**]{.underline}" (589).
Second, [[it was approached **punitively** through **immediate
expulsion** and **isolation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In sum, "[white
[chauvinism came to be]{.mark} considered as]{.underline} a sort of
phenomenon; [[a **thing in itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}, separate from
the fight for Black rights and proletarian revolution" [that was
[**moral** rather than **political**]{.mark}]{.underline} (587). Hence
Jones\' insistence Black women workers\' super-oppression was a
political matter requiring the organized efforts of the Party and
progressive movement.

#### Alt [solves back]{.underline} because collective struggle creates an [impetus]{.underline} for accountability---this is [offense]{.underline} because the aff and perm [preclude]{.underline} that. 

The Lewis **Lemon CRA, 21** (The Lewis Lemon Committee for Revolutionary
Abolition is an informal crew based in Rockford and the surrounding
areas. They are anarchists, communists, and abolitionists developing
political analysis about history, conditions, tactics and strategy in
the region. They ground their work in anti-oppression politics and
organic intellectualism emerging out of class struggle, "Towards
Communism & Anarchy in Rockford: An Historical Analysis from 2011 to
2020 of Revolutionary Movements in Rockford, Illinois," republished in
zine format by True Leap Press: Publishing & Distribution, 2021)

The [three primary criticisms]{.underline} that [emerged repeatedly
within our conversations]{.underline} were the presence of
activist/clout chaser personality types dominating movement spaces,
symbolic protests with little substance, and the divide between radicals
and the larger Rockford community. A lot of the [[movement
work]{.underline}]{.mark} this summer and overall in Rockford [has been
[centralized around charismatic]{.mark} [people]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[This is]{.underline}** our critique of the clout chaser dynamic
especially as radicals interested in deconstructing
**[hierarchy]{.underline}**. [We feel that this dynamic is **central**
to many of the criticisms internal to radicals doing movement building
in Rockford.]{.underline} We feel that this clout chaser dynamic has
only been [exacerbated by social media which uplifts particular
personalities based on an algorithm]{.underline}. The social media
centered activism has [[led to a **toxic culture**]{.mark} where people
who are not constantly "out there" in a physical sense are [often shamed
for not being "**radical enough**]{.mark}". A dynamic like this emerged
at the City Hall **Occupation**]{.underline} after the police shooting
of Tyris Jones where people who did not participate were perceived as
"less radical" or not "going as hard". [This was particularly
problematic as it has effectively [**silenced critiques of movement
tactics** that were **ineffective**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The critique
is ableist as being "out there" through supporting demonstrations is not
the only actions or way to participate in a movement. [We feel that to a
large degree that the charismatic personalities dominating [has to do
with **oppressive gendered dynamics**]{.mark} [**internal** to the
movement spaces]{.mark} [where **critical labor** is done by]{.mark}
women and **[oppressed genders]{.mark}** [while]{.mark} it remains
**[invisible]{.mark}** and unacknowledged.]{.underline} Men have taken
up a lot of space and media attention during actions while not doing
many other types of tasks. [The problem of **[misogyny]{.mark}** in
radical spaces [needs to be **confronted**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Rockford. [[There are men]{.mark} who are **[still allowed in movement
spaces]{.mark}** [despite]{.mark} being creepy and [exhibiting sexual
**predatory behavior**]{.mark} towards **comrades** and
**minors**]{.underline}. [Revolutionaries]{.underline} in Rockford [must
not tolerate this in any form overt or not]{.underline}. We tend to feel
that [many of the [actions]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2020 [[have
been]{.mark} **[completely symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As we
mentioned earlier, we supported City Market [protests]{.mark} initially
but upon reflection, those protests [remained]{.mark} completely
symbolic, non-violent, [devoid]{.mark} [of a **larger strategic
goal**]{.mark} and resulted in **needless arrests**]{.underline}. Though
the authors of the document have varying experiences with the actions at
City Market in terms of participation and consequences for that
participation, we felt that the post by [the group **Rockford Radical
Abolitionists for Change** was particularly insightful]{.underline}
about those protests: "There were avoidable mistakes made. These
mistakes have led to the predicament we are in now. Multiple nonviolent
protestors who are being targeted by the police and the "justice" system
are at risk of losing their freedom due to the way police handled the
situation AND there being a lack of diverse tactics to respond with.
[Every week it was to be expected that there would be brutality and
excessive force used by the police and at times it felt as if the
collective were waiting for it to happen instead of taking control of
the action by working together]{.underline}."---Rockford Radical
Abolitionists For Change While we disagree with the qualification of
protestors as non-violent, which seems to be a supposed attempt to set
them apart from the "violent" protestors, we think this analysis is very
spot on. We agree that [the lack of diverse tactics was a problem, we
attribute this back to the loudest people in the movement getting
attention and dictating tactics on the ground.]{.underline} [Tactics
must be changed when they are clearly ineffective]{.underline}.
[[Instead of symbolic protests]{.underline}]{.mark} centered on
politicians, [[revolutionaries should]{.mark} [**be** putting their
energy towards **organizing along class lines**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We
need to be [present in neighborhoods, workplaces, and
homes.]{.underline} The basis of a revolutionary movement is
[[**building** a]{.mark} strong **[base]{.mark}** of support within
communities]{.underline}. We must [organize with the intent to **[grow
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **education**]{.mark} in our
communities]{.underline} rather than to make symbolic gestures with hope
that politicians will "hear" us. That is not a revolutionary strategy.
[The divorce between the radicals and the community has been a big
issue]{.underline}. [The failure to contest this **[clout chasing
tendency]{.mark}** has [led to]{.mark} a lot of problems internal to
[the movement]{.mark} with certain "activists" [not]{.mark} [wanting to
**take critique**]{.mark} [and **change**]{.mark} their
behavior.]{.underline} This led to certain [individuals with clout begin
to police tones and actions]{.underline}. Some of our [comrades felt
that the [demonstrations]{.mark} at City Market had [become **white
spectacle**]{.mark}]{.underline} that was [[unconnected to]{.mark} the
realities of [black people]{.mark} on the West Side]{.underline} dealing
with the everyday violence of the police. This was voiced when
revolutionaries talked to people in the community. However, due to the
activist mentality, there was a refusal to acknowledge those critiques
because the people making them simply "didn't realize the problems". The
refusal by activists to have humility is a serious problem. The role
that mutual aid has played in building our movement in Rockford has been
vital. Mutual aid formations developing nationwide at the beginning of
the Covid-19 pandemic has allowed for renewed relationship building
within radical circles and more broadly. However, [[it is imperative
that]{.mark} our [mutual aid]{.mark} practice [remains connected]{.mark}
[to a **larger revolutionary strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
strength of the [mutual aid formations]{.underline} and autonomous
mutual aid efforts is they [must not be disconnected from the larger
radical movements]{.underline}. Ideally, mutual aid networks can serve
as a bridge between radicals ourselves and the communities we that live
in. We must be developing new relationships as they will be necessary to
move beyond capitalism. Many people in Rockford already practice mutual
aid. [There is a long history of African American mutual aid history
that we should draw from]{.underline}. One of the mutual aid formations
in the city that emerged would drive in a car caravan around
neighborhoods to give food to folks, to do cop watch and build
relationships. [Despite this]{.underline}, some of [the work called
"mutual aid"]{.underline} over the past year [was more
**transactional**]{.underline} than in a true spirit of mutual aid.
However, we do think that building survival programs is critical. It is
deeply important to distinguish what mutual aid actually is. This model
of mutual aid, that emphasizes organizing against the state and
capitalists, is critical for the future struggle. It is our hope that
more survival programs develop within the next year that are independent
and antagonistic of the State. [We need to think about movements in
terms of relationships and collective power rather than an
individualized effort]{.underline}. This philosophy is encapsulated well
by the Chairman Fred Hampton's quote "You can jail a revolutionary but
you can't jail the revolution." [We need to think about movement
**[beyond reactive mobilizations]{.mark}** lead by a few of charismatic
personalities]{.underline}. Individ[uals can be jailed, corrupted, and
change whereas [**collective power** softens the blow]{.mark} the
movement receives overall [from poor leadership]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Smaller scale actions should be planned with some tactical goals in
mind. [[Radical spaces]{.mark} [must stress]{.mark} the necessity of
[**building infrastructure** to]{.mark} explicitly [support **class
revolt**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Although [there was a lot of education
about **racial capitalism**]{.mark} and its relationship to the State
over this summer, [there has been **little**]{.mark} education [on how
to **fight back**]{.mark} against those systems **[strategically and
effectively]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Very [**few skill trainings** were
held and those that were only dealt with how to respond to State
violence and not counter it.]{.underline} Revolutionaries who had
experience organizing marches and rallies failed to share relevant
skills with newcomers. [Without this skill-sharing of experience amongst
radicals in the city many **[newly politicized militants]{.mark}** [were
left developing]{.mark} necessary skills **[on their
own]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[There was little thought about what
actions could look like]{.mark} **[beyond marches to nowhere]{.mark}**
that ended inevitably in last stand arrests]{.underline}. [We need to
understand that **[revolutionary movements]{.mark}** [must be sustained
over]{.mark} the course of **[lifetimes]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[not]{.mark} just **[weeks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or
months]{.underline}, but lifetimes. [Understanding this need for
**longevity** will make us understand the necessity for sustainable
strategies [to avoid **burnout**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Aff Key To Energize Movements

#### Solidarity link---voting aff [displaces]{.underline} political energies necessary to build organizations that can [endure]{.underline} through exhaustion.

**Dean, 23**---Professor of Politics at Hobart and William Smith
Colleges (Jodi, "Politics is Missing," Boston Review, Summer 2023, dml)

[[Enduring over the long haul is]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly
**[[challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}** for movements and radical
political associations. [Movements **ebb** and **flow**]{.underline};
[the spontaneity that generates enthusiasm **resists** channeling into
routines and institutions]{.underline}. [Radical politics demands
**enormous commitment**]{.underline}; [[even the most dedicated]{.mark}
organizers **[burn out]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Revolutionaries face
repression from the state, police harassment, and legal persecution.

To these challenges we should add the **[unique problems]{.underline}**
that [arise [from]{.mark}]{.underline} social media: [[argument without
**accountability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the seduction of [the **viral
hot take**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the brutal [pleasures
that accrue from **demonstrating**]{.mark} **others'
[weaknesses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The reflexes]{.underline} honed
online [are **ill-suited** to the patient]{.underline},
[focused]{.underline}, [and mundane work of
politics]{.underline}---making placards, doing follow-up calls,
arranging events, finding a meeting time and location, distributing
fliers, and so on. [People who are intellectually or affectively
attracted by revolutionary ideals may **lack the disposition** for
sustained organizational labor]{.underline}.

[When left politics looks like]{.underline} movement without results,
whether as **[fiercely ineffectual]{.underline}** online
**[debates]{.underline}** or as inspiring mass demonstrations that end
with the election and reelection of the same old incumbents, [it's
**hard** to feel that showing up **makes a difference**]{.underline}. In
some of the 2020 protests I joined, after hours of marches, chants, and
standoffs with the police, organizers would thank the crowd for coming
out and remind us to vote. [If **voting** was the answer]{.underline},
[why did we spend]{.underline} the past seven **[hours]{.underline}**
pressed against barricades [in front of the **police
station**?]{.underline}

[Real **material** factors]{.underline} such as working two jobs, caring
for friends and family, trying to get through school, wariness of
encountering the police, and basic transportation [make a
difference]{.underline} in a large country with sprawling cities and
decaying infrastructure. [Time is **precious**]{.underline}. [Part of
the challenge of political endurance is providing people with the sense
that organizing is **worth their time**]{.underline}. [People show up
when they think showing up **matters**]{.underline}.

In her indispensable The Romance of American Communism (1977), Vivian
Gornick recounts a story that a woman named Belle told about her
seventy-year-old father. One snowy night, although bone tired, he got
ready to go back out into the cold to attend a rally at Madison Square
Garden. Belle tried to convince him to stay home. Her father's response:
"If I don't go, who will be there?" A committed member of the Communist
Party, he believed in showing up. He didn't think, "Oh well, there will
be so many people there, one more won't make a difference," or "It's
just another rally, so what." His party, his comrades, expected him to
show up, and he expected this of himself.

Political [[endurance is **strengthened** by purpose and
practice]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Strong]{.mark} political [organizations
give people a **reason** to show up]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They explain
what they are fighting **against** and]{.mark} what they are fighting
**[for]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[They **clarify** why the fight
matters]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Communist Party in its heyday was
enormously skilled at drawing the connections between specific issues
and the long-term fight for socialism. Claudia Jones's famous
International Women's Day speech from 1950 is a great example. She
linked present struggles of progressive and Communist women with the
traditions of the great antislavery fighters Harriet Tubman and
Sojourner Truth, the militant textile workers of 1848, and women's
rights pioneers Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Jones
didn't worry about the differences between them. She drew a
centuries-long arc of courage and commitment. [The immediate political
goal was **unity**]{.underline}. The fight was for peace, equality, and
liberation which depended on organizing Black and white women in the
struggle for socialism. Jones embraced her listeners with
world-historical purpose. [Everyone counts in the battle]{.underline}
against the H-bomb, fascism, and imperialism.

The challenge of political endurance on the left today is that [people
**don't know** what they are fighting for]{.underline}. In recent
decades, **[millions]{.underline}** of people in the United States [have
come out to protest what they're **against**]{.underline}---the World
Trade Organization, the Iraq War, Wall Street, racist police murder.
[The movements **weaken** as they **fail** to give shape to a vision of
what they're **for**]{.underline}---[what does **winning** look
like?]{.underline} The advantage of organizations like the old Communist
Party is that they articulated such a vision: every local struggle and
specific issue gets its energy and purpose from the broader communist
horizon.

[[Correct practice is **essential** to political
endurance]{.underline}]{.mark}. These days [the jargon in [left
organizing spaces is **indistinguishable** from]{.mark}]{.underline}
corporate **[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}**uman
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**esource [**[departments]{.underline}**.
[Disagreements are treated as **identity
differences**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Preoccupation with]{.mark}
interpersonal conflicts and [individual discomfort **displaces
attention**]{.mark} **away** [from political work]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Political [organizations that orient their practices around their
**goals**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[that make clear]{.mark} that people
have joined [a]{.mark} political [struggle]{.mark} that [requires
**discipline** and **unity**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[not a **social
club**]{.underline}]{.mark})---[[navigate]{.mark} interpersonal [issues
by linking action to **purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The old Communist
parties called this practice democratic centralism. Comrades debate,
vote, and accept the decision of the majority. Because keeping everyone
together is so important, [**debate** is conducted with an eye to
generating **unity**]{.underline}---[not scoring points]{.underline},
[blowing off steam]{.underline}, [or demonstrating one's knowledge of
theoretical arcana]{.underline}.

### AT: Alt Homogenizes/Excludes Individual Experience

#### Wrong---collective struggle doesn't require homogeneity, just similarity.

**Mokre, 24**---Institute of Culture Studies, Austrian Academy of
Sciences (Monika, "Negotiating identities. On identity politics and
deliberation," Identities, 2024, DOI: 10.1080/1070289X.2024.2393041,
dml)

There are some similarities between this understanding of the production
of 'the will of the people' and Hardt and Negri's considerations on the
question how the multitude can govern itself: Based again on Spinoza,
Negri postulates that individual desires can converge so that they 'are
displaced from the individual good to the collective good'. And,
according to Spinoza, this convergence happens when individual passions
are rejected in favour of reason (Field Citation2012, 25). [To direct
oneself towards the collective good **does not mean**]{.underline} for
Hardt and Negri to discuss issues of public interest in order [to
improve the existing political order]{.underline} but to struggle
against this 'alienating' political order. [The struggles of the
multitude are]{.underline}, [at the same time]{.underline}, [**local**
and **concrete**]{.underline} struggles, [and parts of transnational
struggles]{.underline}. In this way, [they **differ** from unified
struggles]{.underline} ([**subordinating** all other
struggles]{.underline}, e.g. [to]{.underline} the [class]{.underline}
struggles) [and **identity-based** struggles]{.underline} (Hardt and
Negri Citation2004, 217). '[Identity politics leads the struggle towards
emancipation of a certain group united based on the shared
identity]{.underline}, [but at the same time it **imposes** this
identity]{.underline}. Because of this imposition [the
struggle]{.underline} for the emancipation of a certain class, race,
gender, sexual identity [can serve as a means for rebellion and
emancipation]{.underline}, [but ultimately it **contradicts** the social
metamorphosis necessary for **truly revolutionary**
changes]{.underline}' (Reshe Citation2018). The hopes of Hardt and Negri
(or, rather, their expectations) for a revolution and a better society)
lie on the chaotic, dangerous multitude of which Hobbes was afraid, not
on stable group identities.

Even if one does not share Hardt and Negri's expectation and/or desire
for a revolutionary change their reflections on identity politics, on
the one hand, and general societal goals, on the other one, are of
relevance as they show a possibility to position identity politics
within the striving for the common good. [The starting
point]{.underline} of such an endeavour [would **not** be the assumption
that there is some **universal feature** such as rationality enabling
commonality but rather that one has to start from the **fiction** of the
possibility to understand each other in order to]{.underline} (in the
best case) [really understand each other after
deliberation]{.underline}. Thus, [deliberation]{.underline} in this
sense [does not start from **universalism** or **generalization** but
from the **specific position** of the speakers]{.underline}.Footnote1
'If cooperation or integration takes place without a place from which
one's own interests can be formulated, the disappearance of these
interests and adaptation to the dominant norms almost inevitably occurs'
(Meulenbelt Citation1993, 275, translation MM). [The driver]{.underline}
of such a deliberation [is not the assumption of a common
**base**]{.underline}, [a common **communicative
understanding**]{.underline}, [or common **goals** but the dispute about
**differences** and **fault lines** and the search for possible
commonalities or similarities]{.underline}. Thus, [striving for
**temporary alliances** and **common goals** is the aim]{.underline} of
such a deliberative procedure, [**not a generalized consensus** but
neither the re-affirmation of identities]{.underline}, [and
differences]{.underline}. '[Separatism as an **end** instead of a
**means** towards an end]{.underline} creates new ghettos and
[**excludes** possible allies]{.underline}' (Meulenbelt Citation1993,
275, translation MM). Bhatti's considerations on
[similarity]{.underline} as a dynamic concept rejecting homogeneity as
well as essentialised differences [can form an **analytical** as well as
**practical tool**]{.underline} here: 'The idea of similarity \[...\]
\[is\] suitable to dissolve rigid dichotomies and cultural hierarchies.
\[...\] As a cultural practice, the significance \[...\] of similarity
lies in the fact that it marks social processes. It is about a concept
of movement that represents a countermovement to the dominant
hermeneutics of the own and the foreign' (Bhatti and Kimmich
Citation2015, 18--19, translation MM).

### AT: Ballot=Symbolic Validation, Currency, Etc

#### Conflates [symbolic]{.underline} action of the ballot with [material differences]{.underline}, which [enables]{.underline} elite capture.

**Ludwig 25** \[David; Transdisciplinary researcher and philosopher
focused on questions of social and environmental change, associate
professor in the Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation Group of
Wageningen University; "It's a Shame That You Can't Afford Rent, But We
Can Offer Epistemic Compensation. On Relating Epistemic and Social
Justice"; Social Epistemology; Vol. 39; EC\]

Instead, [the issue is how **symbolic** and **material concerns** become
related within **struggles for reparation**]{.underline}. While
[symbolic reparations matter, they can also be mobilized to **sideline
questions of material reparations**:]{.underline} As Táíwò (2022a, 18)
puts the concern: '[elites can then exploit \[the distinction between
**symbolic** and **material reparations**\] choosing the version of
reparations that is **cheapest for them: the symbolic'**.]{.underline}
As Táíwò's (2022b) work on elite capture clarifies, [contestations of
symbolic reparations reflect wider political concerns about symbolic
inclusion that is not merely insufficient but can be **strategically
mobilized** to **legitimize institutions** and actors who materially
benefit from **pervasive inequality**.]{.underline}

[Concerns about misalignment between symbolic and material reparations
clearly extend to the epistemic domain, as 'symbolic reparations often
involve **distinctively epistemic goods** without identifying them as
such']{.underline} (Lackey 2022, 70). Again, [the concern should not be
misunderstood as the claim that epistemic recognition **does not
matter**.]{.underline} For example, Lackey builds her case for the
'right to be known' around the story of Lucas Baba Sikwepere who was
interviewed by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission
about being shot by a police officer of the apartheid regime and
survived with permanent blindness. Lackey (2022, 54) quotes from
Sikwepere's testimony: 'I feel what has been making me sick all the time
is the fact that I couldn't tell my story. But now I -- it feels like I
got my sight back by coming here and telling you the story'. Lackey
comments that the 'act of telling and being heard, especially after
suffering gross violations or injustice, reflects a deep human desire
for many' (2022, 61) and therefore argues that '[hearing the testimony
of victims is an end itself']{.underline} (2022, 61).

But even if we agree with Lackey's diagnosis, the issue of reparations
in South Africa also brings up difficult questions about the relation
between epistemic and social justice -- [how does the **right to be
known** relate to the right to be **materially
compensated**]{.underline}? In the case of South Africa, [it is hard to
ignore that progress regarding]{.underline} Lackey's (2022) [three main
categories of **epistemic reparations** -- public apologies,
memorialization and education -- contrasts starkly with **material
conditions** that continue to be structured by **colonial and apartheid
histories**]{.underline}. As Ramose (2012, 20) has argued 'from the
standpoint of African philosophy \[. . .\] reconciliation as a
legislative Act was a stillborn because of its objective reinforcement
of the poverty and wealth divide'. To illustrate this assessment with at
least one example and data point: In the Western Cape, the
agriculturally most productive region of the country, 'only 3% of
agricultural land \[. . .\] is owned by black farmers (African,
Coloured, and Indian)' (Villette 2018) despite constituting more than
80% of the population. In the South African context, [the challenge of
distorting priorities]{.underline} may therefore be
[expressed]{.underline} [through]{.underline} a variation of the
article's polemic title: [It's a shame that **you can't have your land
back**, but **we can offer epistemic reparations.**]{.underline}

The case of South Africa highlights the [importance of **addressing the
complex relations** between epistemic and social justice.]{.underline}
[Epistemic reparations have not served as **reliable tools** in
struggles for material reparations and the challenge of distorted
priorities]{.underline} [highlights that an isolated focus on the former
can actually become **part of the problem** rather than **part of the
solution**]{.underline}. The challenge here is not merely that 'other
issues also matter' but rather [how **foregrounding** of symbolic (or in
this case: epistemic) reparations can contribute to **sidelining**
material justice that affects livelihoods **more directly** but is also
**politically far more costly** to achieve. Even if ideal theories can
**integrate symbolic and material reparations** as **complementing**
rather than competing goals, the non-ideal reality of political
struggles often focuses on the **former** while **discrediting the
latter** as unreasonable radicalism.]{.underline}

While I have developed [the challenge]{.underline} of distorting
priorities through the example of 'epistemic reparations', it very much
[applies to the]{.underline} epistemic injustice [literature **at
large** and its tendency to approach]{.underline} '[epistemic justice as
a problem of recognition]{.underline}' (McConkey Citation2004). Although
much of the epistemic injustice scholarship embraces recognition theory
(Fricker Citation2018; Giladi Citation2018) and its critique of purely
distributive approaches to justice, it also points to more recent
frustrations with a superficial 'politics of recognition' and its
tendency to sideline concerns about the material conditions of
inequality.

[Indigenous scholar-activists]{.underline} like Coulthard (2014), for
example, have [argued that recognition of Indigenous culture **matters**
but has also become **misused** as a **substitute for redistribution**
of **economic resources** and **political power** to Indigenous
people.]{.underline} Similar [concerns appear in the **Black radical
tradition** that challenges **hollowed-out identity politics** and its
focus on **symbolic recognition** of **Black culture or Black
excellence** instead of resisting **material exploitation and
dispossession** of Black communities]{.underline} (James 2022; Táíwò
2022b). For example, James argues that [mainstreamed identity politics
has **betrayed** the **material demands of the Civil Rights Movement**
and become 'intoxicated with that **politics of symbolism** and less
willing to demand any kind of truly **redistributive materialist
agenda** for working-class and poor Black folk, who are the majority of
Black folk']{.underline} (2022, 221). Finally, consider [transnational
feminism]{.underline} (Mohanty 2003) [and its 'critique of white
feminists' pernicious mischaracterization of Third World women's
oppression as merely a worse case of gender oppression']{.underline}
(Herr 2014, 2), [focusing on issues such as recognition of sexual
identities or sexual violence in isolation of their entanglement with
the material conditions of class- and racebased oppression.]{.underline}

[All three traditions challenge a **narrow focus** on recognition while
also carefully avoiding accusations of 'economic reductionism' or 'class
reductionism']{.underline} that Spiegel (2022, 86) has [aptly described
as 'one of the **great anxieties**]{.underline} of 20th and 21st
\[century\] social philosophy'. Coulthard, for example, argues that the
[relations between Indigenous peoples and the]{.underline} Canadian
[**state** have become structured by a **superficial politics of
recognition** that puts heavy emphasis on the valuation of Indigenous
culture without undoing material dispossession and
exploitation]{.underline}. At the same time, Coulthard emphasizes that
Indigenous struggles do not reduce to struggles about the distribution
of economic resources (2014, 14). Instead, Coulthard's Red Skin, White
Masks follows Fanon's Black Skin, White Masks in [acknowledging the
importance of recognition to challenge framings of the colonized as
'uncivilized' and 'primitive' **while situating recognition** in
struggles for **material redistribution**]{.underline}: As Fanon argues,
[there is a '**double process**: primarily, economic; subsequently, the
internalization \[. . .\] of this inferiority.]{.underline} \[. . .\]
The black man must wage his war on both levels: Since [historically they
**influence each other**, any **unilateral liberation is incomplete**,
and the gravest mistake would be to believe in their automatic
interdependence']{.underline} (Fanon 1986, 13). Fanon's analysis
resonates with Coulthard's as [Indigenous struggles are indeed
**partially about recognition** while simultaneously **threatened by a
liberal 'politics of recognition'** that treats the **celebration** of
Indigenous culture as a **substitute for changing material
conditions.**]{.underline}

### AT: Ballot Fails

#### Ballot's both [necessary]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline}---solidarity is a [practice]{.underline} that starts at the most [quotidian]{.underline} levels like this debate.

**Taylor and Hunt-Hendrix, 24**---co-founder of The Debt Collective;
senior advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project, founder of
Way to Win and Solidaire (Astra and Leah, "Solidarity and the Sacred,"
*Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*,
Chapter 8, pp. 262-264, dml)

Where the previous two chapters focused on the larger domestic and
international structures that can help cultivate and sustain solidarity,
here we are focused on the actions that can be taken by individuals and
by smaller groups. [Transformative solidarity]{.underline} should aim to
transform policy, but this transformation [**begins** with
people]{.underline}---[with our **personal choices**]{.underline}. [We
all exist embedded in structures and systems that shape how we are able
to live out our lives]{.underline}, [but the way we **live** and
**decisions** we make can in turn **impact** those structures and
**alter** our societies]{.underline}, [for better and
worse]{.underline}. In Graeber's words, [human beings and the social
worlds we inhabit are]{.underline} "[projects of **mutual
creation**]{.underline}"---[our actions can either **reinforce the
status quo** or help **bring about**]{.underline} much-needed
**[change]{.underline}**.\[7\] On a fundamental level, solidarity comes
down to relationships.

When Durkheim observed that solidarity is created and sustained through
a shared sense of the sacred, he was saying that [solidarity is a
**practice**]{.underline}: [it must be **enacted** or else it **does not
exist**]{.underline}. Where [transformative solidarity]{.underline} is
concerned, this practice might entail attending a protest, sharing a
petition, or joining a political organization. But it also [manifests in
**smaller quotidian ways** through our **daily actions** and
**encounters**]{.underline}. [It can be]{.underline} useful to consider
solidarity as [a **habit of mind**]{.underline}, [or a particular kind
of **virtuous behavior**]{.underline}, [that orients us toward the
common good]{.underline}. Transformative solidarity, we argue, doesn't
require the creation of new religious or political dogma, but
[it]{.underline} does require a baseline of reverence for the fragile
ecosystems and communities on which we depend. Solidarity [asks each of
us to attend to those around us]{.underline}.

Consecrating the sacred, in Durkheim's sense, takes time. In the wake of
the French Revolution, the insurgent lawyer Maximilien Robespierre took
a universalist and authoritarian approach to the problem of [forging
common values]{.underline}. As the revolution shook the foundations of
the Church and the monarchy, Robespierre sought to replace these
institutions with a new religion: the Cult of the Supreme Being. It
lasted for around eight weeks before he was sent to the guillotine.\[8\]
Robespierre's absurd and tragic attempt to impose a new theological
doctrine [by **fiat** failed]{.underline}, [but over time the **French
Revolution**]{.underline}---[as a **collective practice** involving
hundreds of thousands of people and inspiring more across the
world]{.underline}, from Europe to the Caribbean---[did help **elevate**
and **spread** ideas that]{.underline} now fit Durkheim's definition of
sacred, including the tripartite motto of liberté, égalité, fraternité
that [helped pave the way for the modern emergence of
solidarity]{.underline}. As decades and centuries passed, these
principles and others---liberal democratic ideals of consent of the
governed, equality under the law, minority rights, religious tolerance,
freedom of expression, and so on---have become, in Durkheim's words,
"obligatory in a certain sense, because of the very fact of their being
held in common...they are to some extent indistinguishable from
religious beliefs proper."\[9\] [These principles have become part of
the **social fabric**]{.underline}. [Though we often fail to live up to
them in **practice**]{.underline}, [they serve as both a **baseline**
and a **beacon**]{.underline}. They are, in Durkheim's sense, sacred.

### AT: Ballot Solves In Here But Not Out There

#### This is [proof]{.underline} of the link---if the ballot doesn't solve "out there" then it can't solve "in here" either!

**al-Gharbi, 24**---assistant professor in the School of Communication
and Journalism at Stony Brook University (Musa, "Mystification of Social
Processes," *We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a
New Elite*, Chapter 6, pp. 286-287, dml)

This [[pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[tends to be applied in a
**highly selective** manner]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, [[an
individual's **vote** virtually **never** changes the
outcome]{.underline}]{.mark} of an election, certainly [not [at the
national level]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Any particular individual
participating in a **protest**]{.underline}, writing a letter to one's
representatives, [or engaging in **political discourse**]{.underline}
online or in other public forums [is **similarly unlikely**
to]{.underline}, [themselves]{.underline}, [influence or overturn the
prevailing order in **any meaningful way**]{.underline}.57
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[symbolic capitalists **don't tend to
assert**]{.underline}]{.mark}, "[[If it doesn't bring about
**revolution**]{.underline}, [it's **not worth
doing**]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[when we engage in **expressive
politics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We **don't shrink** before the
**apparent futility** of our actions when engaging in]{.mark} cosmic
[warfare over **symbols**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
**[rhetoric]{.underline}**, [or **partisan struggles**]{.underline}
(i.e., when we're doing things that are satisfying or useful for us).
Instead, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[drop in the
bucket]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[argument gets **conveniently trotted
out** when we're challenged to take **inconvenient actions**]{.mark} or
make **costly sacrifices** in pursuit of our expressed
ideals]{.underline}.

Across the board, [narratives and ideological [frameworks presented
as]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[radical]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[critiques]{.mark} of the social order [are]{.mark} regularly [deployed
as **implicit justifications** for]{.mark}]{.underline} contemporary
[[inequality-reproducing behaviors]{.mark} and adverse states of
affairs]{.underline}. However, [symbolic capitalists are often blind to
these realities precisely in virtue of our sincere
commitments]{.underline} to "social justice" ([in the
**abstract**]{.underline}).

### AT: Don't Make Them Responsible

#### This proves our link args about individualization---it's not about [individual responsibility]{.underline}, but [collective liability]{.underline}.

**Taylor and Hunt-Hendrix, 24**---co-founder of The Debt Collective;
senior advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project, founder of
Way to Win and Solidaire (Astra and Leah, "Solidarity Beyond Borders,"
*Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*,
Chapter 7, pp. 257-258, dml)

[But]{.underline}, the common retort goes, [[if we are not the
individuals who committed]{.mark} atrocities or [misdeeds
**directly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[what]{.mark} kind of
[**responsibility** do we have?]{.mark}]{.underline} [What do I have to
do with tragedies]{.underline} that took place before my birth or [in
faraway places?]{.underline} In his book Reconsidering Reparations, the
Nigerian-American philosopher Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò empathizes with this
objection, and then takes it to task. [The [absence of individual
blame]{.mark}]{.underline}, he argues, [**[does not shield us]{.mark}**
from responsibility]{.underline}. [[Notions of individual]{.mark}
guilt]{.underline}, [[complicity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
responsibility [are **inadequate**]{.mark} given the systemic and
sustained violence perpetrated by centuries of racial
capitalism]{.underline}. [We are **all** implicated]{.underline}. In
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} way, Táíwò [[**rejects** the idea that we
can **essentialize** our identities]{.underline}]{.mark}; [the vast
majority of human beings are not **purely guilty** or **purely
innocent**]{.underline}, neither solely perpetrator nor solely victim.
Inspired by Martin Luther King Jr., Táíwò insists that "we are all
morally 'in the red.' " Furthermore, while it is clearly the case that
the governments of the Global North perpetrated severe violence on the
people of the Global South while also exploiting their labor, as we have
noted, the economic rewards have been unevenly distributed.
Working-class white Americans saw their jobs evaporate and livelihoods
diminish, even as they enjoyed more privileges than their Black and
immigrant counterparts; meanwhile, even the most disadvantaged Americans
were likely better off than the individuals working in the maquiladoras
and sweatshops of the Global South. These complexities are part of the
reason [Táíwò prefers]{.underline} the concept of [**liability** to
culpability]{.underline}---[[sometimes we are **liable** for things that
we are **not personally at fault for**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [To be
liable is to be **obligated**]{.underline}. [We may not have
**created**]{.underline} the [abject living and working
conditions]{.underline} of the factory workers on the southern side of
the U.S. border, [but we are **bound** to them
nevertheless]{.underline}. [To improve their lot is also to improve our
own]{.underline}.\[110\]

### AT: Multiple Strategies Good

#### [Do not abandon the line struggle]{.underline} -- principled disagreement over specific lines between parallel movements creates the conditions for the emergence of a unified party, [but]{.underline} it requires [attention to and debate around]{.underline} difference rather than meaningless calls for "left unity." Holding each other's politics [accountable]{.underline} is good and [necessary]{.underline} to build a better world.

**Moufawad-Paul 13** -- Joshua Moufawad-Paul is a Canadian academic and
writer from Toronto, Canada, and a professor of philosophy at York
University. "Unity in Struggle and Struggle in Unity", M-L-M Mayhem,

// rose

Thus, while there are admittedly internecine squabbles amongst the
general left that can be classified as \"sectarian\", there are also
principled lines of demarcation that are drawn for very good reasons. In
a first world context that is not yet revolutionary (even if the
objective circumstances are ripe, the subjective circumstances are
horribly underdeveloped), it is impossible for the movement to narrow
into a focused point where a vanguard can clearly emerge and, in this
emergence, settle these squabbles by winning over the masses while, at
the same time, isolating and eradicating those factions that refuse, out
of sectarian pride and a practical divorcement from the revolutionary
instance, to recognize an emergent vanguard. We are not at this point,
and some anti-capitalist groups will even argue that we should never be
at this point because they deny the necessity of a revolutionary
vanguard. Point being: there are multiple left-wing organizations and
factions, many of which exist for good reason, that are either
struggling to emerge as the revolutionary vanguard or struggling for a
movement that lacks a vanguard altogether.

[Here it needs to be said that in the current conjuncture at the centres
of capitalism there is nothing wrong with this multiplicity. Although I
believe that [it is erroneous to make]{.mark} the fact of [multiplicity
a]{.mark} principle of revolutionary [strategy]{.mark} (hence my
rejection of \"movementism\"), I do not think we should see the concrete
reality of multiple left tendencies as something to be feared. [It is
just a fact]{.mark}, and a fact we have inherited from a history of
revisionism and failure, that can only be overcome by engaging with this
multiplicity and, in the process, winning over the masses to whatever
organization succeeds in emerging as the party of the advanced
guard.]{.underline} Until then, the fact of leftist multiplicity is
something we have to engage with because it is a fact. And though I
realize that some groups operate in denial of this fact, it is my
contention that this willful obliviousness will only harm their
development. [For even if we believe that there needs to come a time
when [a revolutionary organization unified in theory and practice
becomes the]{.mark} revolutionary [organization in a given]{.mark}
social [context]{.mark}, such an organization will grow into this
organization through its engagement with other left-wing organizations.
That is, we can learn from different tendencies; we can grow by
interacting with them]{.underline}.

Herein lies the actual distinction between a sectarian and a
non-sectarian approach to anti-capitalism: whereas the sectarian will
loathe these multiple trajectories, and thus fear the dilution of a pure
politics that results from multiplicity, the non-sectarian will accept
such a multiplicity as a fact and try to work with this fact. For this
fact is the fact of line struggle, and it is nothing to be feared;
struggling with and sometimes against different leftist factions is only
a problem if one fears political pollution----and only the cultist fears
such pollution[. And yet it is worth repeating, as I have argued over
and over, that to adhere to [a principled political position is
not]{.mark} the same as [being sectarian:]{.mark} while [we should not
fear line struggle]{.mark}, and need to accept that there are currently
multiple political positions within the left, it is a matter of
principle to argue, especially if one adheres to a line that treats the
concept of a party vanguard as significant, that one theoretically
unified organization can and should emerge as hegemonic.]{.underline}

The multiplicity of trajectories, then, is a fact that cannot be denied;
the hope that these trajectories will be subsumed by a unified
organization that can account for interior multiplicity is something
some of us believe is worth considering. [To]{.underline} briefly
demystify this jargon-laced set of sentences: there was a multiplicity
of political organizations in Russia at the turn of the 20th Century
that provided the crucible for the emergence of a single vanguard
organization that was forced to prove itself in this context; there was
a multiplicity of political lines and factions in China in the early to
mid 20th century that produced a splintering revolutionary party in the
countryside that, by 1949, proved it was the vanguard. [[Neither]{.mark}
of these [world historical revolution]{.mark}s [would have been possible
without a context]{.mark} of revolutionary ferment [in which a
multiplicity of political lines vied for dominance and,]{.mark} in this
vying, produced the circumstances that could narrow into a revolutionary
event where [one line]{.mark}, that had learned from the others, would
[arise as revolutionary]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2: theoretical difference as unavoidable and necessary

[We are stuck with this contradiction: [we have to work together
and]{.mark} we have to [struggle against each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline} Work together because we all believe that
capitalism needs to be overcome. [Struggle against each other because
t[here are real differences that will]{.mark} necessarily [be
encountered]{.mark} in any attempt to supersede capitalism]{.underline}.
These differences are not simply the result of sectarian differences but
are visceral realities... Take, for example, my anecdote about
Palestinian self-determination mentioned earlier----this was not a
sectarian difference but a matter of principle that could only result in
a different method of theory and practice. [Other examples abound:
questions of [race and gender during]{.mark} the US revolutionary
[struggles in the]{.mark} 196[0s and]{.mark} 19[70s were significant
dividing lines]{.mark}----and for good reason!]{.underline}

To be fair, there are theoretical differences amongst marxist
organizations that are quite silly, and that nobody these days probably
cares about, that result from theoretical hair-splitting that is about
as useful as theological debates in medieval Catholicism. If an
organization cannot get past an arcane difference that has nothing to do
with concrete struggle, and might only exist in order to define oneself
as a more faithful (in the religious sense) marxist than another sect,
then they probably cannot work with other members of the left. Again:
this is the hallmark of sectarianism.

But we need to recognize the fact, noted in the section above, that
there are principled lines of demarcation that are important and cannot
simply be misconstrued as \"sectarian\" simply because they maintain
principled points of difference. [Principled difference is not
sectarianism, and those who would like the entire left to believe the
same thing and get along as a single organization are often those who,
in their attempt to obliterate difference and multiplicity, are guilty
of, implicitly or explicitly, attempting to subordinate the movement to
their own ideological position. That is, the political position that
often masquerades as \"anti-sectarian\" is itself a form of sectarianism
in that it is actually arguing, even if it is in denial, \"why can\'t
everyone get along according to my principles of unity?\"]{.underline}

[If we should not fear multiple anti-capitalist tendencies, then we
should not fear the fact that [difference]{.mark} between tendencies
sometimes [exists for a good reason.]{.mark} Moreover, [we should be
prepared to accept]{.mark} that a [rejection and]{.mark} furious [line
struggle against a given tendency]{.mark} is necessary for the
development of a movement, [especially if]{.mark} this line struggle is
intrinsically [wed to praxis rather than]{.mark} simply an exchange of
[polemics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What I mean here is that in the course of revolutionary practice there
often develops a theoretical line, based on what encounters in the
concrete world, that sets one organization apart from another. Take, for
example, the development of the political line of the Bolshevik party
led by Lenin and how it set Lenin\'s faction apart from other communist
factions in Russia and in the International Communist Movement. Take,
for example, the development of the political line in the communist
faction in China led by Mao that set it apart from the original
Communist Party of China. [These differences mattered because they had
to do with making revolution; to ignore these differences for the sake
of some \"[let\'s-just-all-get-along\" socialism would be tantamount to
abandoning revolutionary struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For there are indeed political lines that need to be struggled against
and marxist theory has been enriched because of this line struggle. We
cannot forget that Marx and Engels established the foundations of
historical materialism and its primacy as the revolutionary science of
the working class by waging line struggle against other tendencies in
the movement of their time. The hope, as I argued in the Party as
Process, is that line struggles between multiple organizations----which
we should not necessarily see as sectarian, nor as something to be
loathed----will be won by an emergent vanguard that proves its line in
the concrete class struggle of its social context.

### AT: No Solidarity With Racists

#### The alt doesn't require solidarity with bigots, but [does]{.underline} allow for the possibility of [renouncing]{.underline} bigotry. If the aff rejects that, we're [impact turning]{.underline} it.

**Taylor and Hunt-Hendrix, 24**---co-founder of The Debt Collective;
senior advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project, founder of
Way to Win and Solidaire (Astra and Leah, "Us vs. Them," *Solidarity:
The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*, Chapter 2, pp.
65-69, dml)

American conservatives, for example, increasingly seem dead set on
antagonistic conflict; they frame immigrants and leftists as an
existential threat. As Kevin Phillips, the infamous Nixon advisor, said
to a journalist during the campaign in 1968, "The whole secret of
politics is knowing who hates who."\[28\] This is an orientation that
stands in stark contrast to [the nonviolent tradition]{.underline}
progressives admire, to the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin
Luther King Jr., who called on their followers to love their enemies.
Both King and Gandhi had sharp critiques of those who create and sustain
injustice, yet they nevertheless [believed that nonviolent action should
seek **redemption** of political enemies rather than total
**defeat**]{.underline}. **[King]{.underline}** movingly [envisioned
a]{.underline} "**[beloved community]{.underline}**," [where even former
opponents could **make amends** and in so doing become part of a
**stronger** and **larger** Us]{.underline}. In a similar vein,
[**Hayes** and **Kaba** talk about the need to foster]{.underline} what
they call [a]{.underline} "**[counterculture of rebellious
care]{.underline}**," [which **refuses** to see people as **unworthy of
compassion** or **incapable of change**]{.underline}. \[29\]

We, too, believe that [we must not forget the **human capacity for
change**]{.underline}, and that [the ultimate goal is
**transformation**]{.underline}, [not **annihilation**]{.underline}, [of
our adversaries]{.underline}. [But this conviction is **not
incompatible** with the recognition that certain structural positions in
our society should **cease to exist**]{.underline}, [and that we should
**oppose proponents** of an unjust and violent society with **all our
might**]{.underline}. A democratic socialist, King understood that [our
economy must be **transformed** so that **no dominant class stands to
profit** from other people's exploitation and degradation]{.underline}.
[The point isn't to **vanquish individuals**]{.underline}; [it's to
**remake unjust systems**]{.underline}. This is why it is so absurd when
financiers compare hostility toward the wealthy to the Nazis'
fanaticism, as Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman did in an overwrought
response to efforts to close the carried-interest loophole: "It's like
when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939."\[30\] Obviously the effort to make
the tax code more equitable is in no way equivalent to extinguishing a
human life or carrying out genocide. In fact, a more equitable tax code
is one way to save quite a few lives through expanded health and social
services.

Addressing these structural injustices, and disempowering those who
profit from and perpetuate them, requires polarization, not
de-escalation. To build a transformative majority capable of taking on
an increasingly greedy elite and lethal far right, we need to clearly
define an adversary. The process of polarization ---identifying two
sides in a struggle and naming the source of oppression and
exploitation---is a necessary component of building transformative
solidarity, and of any successful social movement. Importantly, though,
[the boundary between Us and Them need not be **unyielding** or
**eternally hostile**]{.underline}. [It's **preferable**]{.underline},
[and **more strategic**]{.underline}, [for the border to be
**porous**]{.underline}, allowing members to come in and out.
[Parishioners of a **Catholic congregation**]{.underline}, for example,
[might join with a community organization to petition for a **living
wage** for city employees]{.underline}, [but might be on the other side
of]{.underline} the table during [a debate about **reproductive
justice**]{.underline}. Or [consider what happened in
**2023**]{.underline}, [when the three women **Republican
representatives** in the South Carolina state senate reached across
party lines in an attempt to block a proposed **abortion
ban**]{.underline}.\[31\] **[Saul Alinsky]{.underline}**, the legendary
political activist who brought the model of labor organizing into
neighborhoods and communities like the Chicago stockyards and wrote
about his model in Rules for Radicals, was known for his maxim "[no
permanent **friends** and no permanent **enemies**]{.underline}."\[32\]
[There should]{.underline}, instead, [be permanent
**principles**]{.underline}, [and in pursuit of those
principles]{.underline}, [coalition partners will **change** depending
on the specific campaigns and circumstances]{.underline}.

There are a number of different ways polarization, or a distinction
between Us and Them, can be visualized spatially. Nationalism, for
example, functions on an inside/outside basis, where borders---and the
state and private-sector apparatuses protecting those borders---keep
outsiders at bay, giving the nation- state its cohesion and citizenship
its exclusive status. Class struggles have historically been referred to
as top versus bottom, while political debates are typically drawn as
Left versus Right. The challenge, for progressives, is acknowledging
multiple sources of oppression at once. Given all the different ways
that exploitation happens, the lines between allies and adversaries can
quickly become muddled.

We need to draw our lines with care, aware that some kinds of
polarization conceal others. To return to nationalism as a prime
example: many socialists and communists refused to take a side during
World War I, fearing that it would stoke nationalist sympathies and
dampen the prospects for international working-class solidarity. Voicing
this sentiment is what got the celebrated American socialist organizer
and five-time presidential candidate Eugene Debs convicted of sedition.
In 1918, Debs denounced the First World War; the only war in which he
would enlist, he proclaimed, was what he called "the holy war of the
workers of the world against the exploiters of the world."\[33\]
Nationalism, Debs believed, was a ruling-class ideology that covered up
class exploitation with patriotism, obscuring the fact that rich and
poor have opposing interests despite sharing a homeland. Nationalism
distracts from domestic inequities---from the fact that some citizens
own multiple vacation homes while others sleep in their cars---by
focusing on an external threat, including distant governments or
vulnerable immigrants and refugees. This is true of [many forms of
reactionary solidarity]{.underline} that [serve to **set us against each
other** and **hide the true enemy**]{.underline}: [pitting]{.underline}
citizens against foreigners, [white people against racialized
people]{.underline}, and immigrant workers against unionized workers
**[lets the ruling class off the hook]{.underline}**.

As the authors of the Combahee River Collective Statement understood,
[any analysis limited to a **single form** of
oppression]{.underline}---whether based on national origin, race,
gender, sexuality, or class---[will **inevitably leave people out** and
work **against** solidarity rather than build a bigger Us]{.underline}.
[Efforts focused only on the problem of **patriarchy**]{.underline}
without thinking about race or class, for example, [risk perpetuating
inequality and devolving into a **hollow corporate
feminism**]{.underline}, pushing for women to serve as high-powered CEOs
and public officials, as though equal opportunity to pay workers
starvation wages and jail immigrants at the border is the true aim of
gender justice. Likewise, [singular attention to **race** can produce
the same effects]{.underline}, [leading to]{.underline} the phenomenon
Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor describes as "**[Black faces in high
places]{.underline}**," [providing a patina of diversity while
neoliberal capitalism continues to **wreak havoc** on people and the
planet]{.underline}.\[34\] Meanwhile, understanding capitalism, and the
role of capitalists in perpetuating inequity, is central, but [a
**class-only** analysis risks **missing** the myriad ways
racism]{.underline}, [patriarchy]{.underline}, [xenophobia]{.underline},
[and ableism shape people's reality]{.underline}. [A **careless** or
**reductive refusal** to acknowledge the complexity of people's lives
**hampers** our ability to bring them into the movement and creates a
**weakened** and **impoverished** Us]{.underline}.

The task of tackling multiple, interlocking sources of oppression at
once is daunting, but it is the only worthwhile way to proceed. As our
understanding of the causes of injustice deepens, taking into account
the impacts of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, economic exploitation,
climate degradation, and more, [we are in danger of having **so many
opponents** that potential allies come to us **tarnished** by their
association with some form of oppression]{.underline}. [But turning on
each other is a **dead end**]{.underline}. [We must face these
complications]{.underline}, [and the reality of our own complicity with
oppressive systems]{.underline}, [with humility]{.underline}, [and
without losing sight of our larger aims]{.underline}. [We must
remember]{.underline} Alinsky's maxim of "**[no permanent
enemies]{.underline}**," [as well as our goal]{.underline}: [not
opposition for its **own sake**]{.underline}, [but the building of the
**largest** and **most powerful** Us possible]{.underline}. This is why
we need solidarity. [Our real adversaries are those who **purposely
engage** in tactics of **divide** and **conquer** for personal and
political gain]{.underline}. [This exploitation]{.underline}, [and the
underlying systems that enable it]{.underline}, [must be
opposed]{.underline}. To do that, the rest of us need to get
organized--- which is much easier said than done.

### AT: No Internal Link

#### It's not about individual action but systemic dynamics.

**Thomas, 25**---Professor of Sociology at the State University of New
York at Oneonta (Alexander, "Against Sociology," *The Sociological
Predicament: Academia and the Contradictions of Working Class
Consciousness*, Chapter 2, pp. 44, dml)

The self-anointing by sociologists to leadership of the Left was, to
again borrow the phrase from Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, an unacknowledged version of
elite capture.46 Paradoxically, [elite capture does not require
**individual** academics to **consciously attempt** to support the
dominant system]{.underline}---[elite capture is a **system
effect**]{.underline}. As Táíwò notes:

Elite capture is not a conspiracy. [It's **bigger** than cynical
appropriations]{.underline}, [opportunism]{.underline}, [or the moral
successes or failures of any **individual**]{.underline} or group. [It
is a]{.underline} kind of **[system behavior]{.underline}**---a
phenomenon articulated at the population level, [an
**observable**]{.underline} (**[predictable]{.underline}**) [**pattern**
of actions involving individuals]{.underline}, [groups]{.underline},
[and subgroups]{.underline}, [**each** of whom may be pursuing **any
number of different goals** from their own narrow point of
view]{.underline}. [Elite capture is **not limited to the scope of their
interactions**]{.underline}. [The **constant dynamic** of individual and
group interactions makes up a **social system**]{.underline}, [and elite
capture emerges out of that dynamic]{.underline}.47

[The **systemic effect** of an individual wanting to do **one**
thing]{.underline} (fight!) [and the system]{.underline} itself
[**imposing** its **own logic**]{.underline} (protect the interests of
the top 20 percent) [is at the **heart** of the]{.underline}
sociological [predicament]{.underline}.

The Predicament

The sociological predicament is that [any action or inaction will
**reaffirm**]{.underline}, [even **reify**]{.underline}, [the underlying
social structure]{.underline}. This fact emerges from the dynamics
underlying social evolution. [A society based on the **extraction** of
surplus from one population for the benefit of another
will]{.underline}, [even with the **reshuffling** of power
relations]{.underline}, [**regress** over time to unequal
political-economic relations]{.underline}.48 This deep structure imposes
itself on the larger society, negating utopian goals of building a great
society. This is true even if the lion's share of exchange is through
equitable trade as the presence of unequal trade eventually tilts back
to growing inequality. [The uncovering of these dynamics results in a
desire]{.underline}, even a desperation, [to attempt to change the
system which]{.underline}, **[paradoxically]{.underline}**, [**further
refines** the contours of the underlying structure]{.underline}.

### AT: No Theory Of X Violence

#### This is the link, [not]{.underline} an alt answer. If we win the alt's [materially]{.underline} effective, then rejecting it on [theoretical]{.underline} grounds perpetuates [anticommunist dogma]{.underline}. 

**Ford, 24**---Associate Professor of Education Studies, DePauw
University (Derek, "What's so Marxist about Marxist Educational
Theory?," Policy Futures in Education, 22(8), 1570-1587, dml)

In my reading, Dumas explains [the **endless spiral** of]{.underline}
the [debates]{.underline}: [they're **asking the wrong
questions**!]{.underline} If this is the case, then Dumas is more of a
Marxist than the (neo)Marxists. First, Dumas\' methodology is the same
that Marx used to develop his unfinished critique of capitalism. Second,
Dumas\' [refusal to tussle over **what theory is superior** aligns with
Marx's organizing and theorizing]{.underline}, in which he embraced
united fronts with various and even antagonistic political tendencies.
Third, Dumas, like Marx, views theories as dynamic and [in]{.underline}
motion, [**not even suggesting** a theory can have the]{.underline}
"**[final word]{.underline}**" [forever and for all time]{.underline}.
My research works from a void Dumas helps me spot in the race-class
debates: any engagement with the actual and ongoing world-historic
transformations fighting to overthrow racist oppression and imperialist
exploitation. The roots of this absence boil down to [the **real
dogmatism** holding activist scholarship back]{.underline}:
**[anticommunism]{.underline}**. I hold that [this]{.underline} dogma
[keeps potentially radical work **circling** within a **spiral**
of]{.underline}, in Gabriel Rockhill's (2021: 133) terms, critical
theories that, whether their object of critique is capitalism or racism,
amount to [theory that is **overwhelmingly critical** of the praxis of
radical social movements]{.underline}. I reclaim the world-historic
legacies on which we build, for all their tragedies and defeats, for
they do not arise out of thin air, however, but are linked to certain
structural conditions and systemic relations specific to time and place
and produced with certain intentions. [The very real racial divisions
and manifestations of white and national chauvinism that **fragment**
and **interrupt** mass movements and organizations result from **myriad
factors**]{.underline}, [but the global revolutionary era led in large
part by communists and the colonized world offers both the **most
fruitful explanations** of those conditions and connections and examples
of **actually overthrowing** them]{.underline}.

Simply put, [we **can't overcome** the class-race divide
without]{.underline} simultaneously, or beforehand, [**breaching** the
theory-reality divide]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} Fred
**[Hampton]{.underline}** (2014: 139) flawlessly [phrased
it]{.underline} while speaking on the Black Panther Party's free
breakfast programs, "we sayin" something like this---we saying that
[theory's **cool**]{.underline}, [but theory with no practice **ain't
shit**]{.underline}. Speaking academically relative to the race-class
literature, the problem I'm identifying is similar but even more
elementary in that [it isn't even a matter of **practice**]{.underline};
[it's a need to take **material reality** and **history** into
account]{.underline}. [Without the latter]{.underline}, **[even theory
ain't shit]{.underline}**. [Rather than **what theory**]{.underline} or
theorist [is **superior**]{.underline}, [my project is guided by the
objectives to **be accomplished** and the objectives we **have
accomplished**]{.underline} (Ford 2023b). [The]{.underline} class-race
[divide **can't be bridged** in the realm of **thought** because it is
the **product** of academic thought]{.underline}. To be sure, all of us
engaged in liberatory work can undertheorize or inaccurately relay the
sources on which we base our critiques, build our theories, organize
with others, and collectively struggle for global emancipation. As
theories are necessarily abstractions, there is intellectual and
political value in clarifying worldviews.

Yet, [the **fundamental problem** is the idea that we can **test the
effectivity of any political theory on paper**]{.underline} or in the
brain. [The notion that theoretical battles are won in the realm of
theory is an **anathema** to Marxism]{.underline}, [which
is]{.underline}, above all else, [a theoretical weapon used to
**understand** and **transform** the world that **varies** depending on
time]{.underline}, [space]{.underline}, [and society]{.underline}. This
is crystallized throughout the communist tradition. Take, for example,
Kim Il Sung's (1982: 371) articulation of the Juche idea, which in
essence foregrounds the dynamism of Marxism-Leninism against "dogmatism,
flunkeyism, and formalism," each of which stifle "our people's
creativity." Carlos Martinez (2023: 24) likewise argues against dividing
the Chinese Revolution by any Great Walls, showing that "the CPC has
sought to creatively apply and develop Marxism according to the
prevailing concrete circumstances." Indeed, [the Marxism that aids
liberation struggles **never manifests the same** as any
other]{.underline}.

The fact that this foundational tenet of Marxism is rarely addressed or
even asked in educational research raised the question with which I
titled this paper: "What's so Marxist about Marxist educational theory?"
"This is a kind of rebuttal to Antonia Darder and Rodolfo Torres" (2011)
article critiquing CRT from a Marxist perspective they titled, "What's
so critical about critical race theory?" [Revolutionary theories are
**only proven in action**]{.underline}, [and we can only evaluate them
based on their]{.underline} material, political, affective,
psychological, and other [effects relative to a **concrete
conjuncture**]{.underline}. The question posed in the title is sincere
nonetheless, and I start pursuing it by highlighting some contemporary
CRT scholarship, showing that it's fertile ground for advancing
pedagogical and political praxis against capitalist exploitation, white
supremacy, and other forms of oppression.

### AT: Perm

#### No doing both---starting points [and]{.underline} praxis are mutually exclusive. 

Melissa **Naschek 18**, Co-Chair of the Philadelphia Democratic
Socialists of America, 8/28/18, "The Identity Mistake,"
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/mistaken-identity-asaid-haider-review-identity-politics

[[We Can't "Do Both"]{.underline}]{.mark}

Today, with the popularity of Bernie Sanders and a resurgence in trade
union activity, [circumstances are finally re-emerging for a political
program capable of fostering **mass working-class
solidarity**]{.underline}. Instead, Haider would have us turn to the
model that has failed the working class for years: [**rhetorically
accepting identity-based particularism** at the implicit expense of
class-based universalism]{.underline}.

Of course, Haider does not overtly suggest that this is an either/or.
Instead, he insists that we must [do both]{.underline} ---
[**[working-class]{.mark} politics** [and **identity
politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**But "doing both" is easier said than done**. [Identity]{.mark}
politics and [class politics]{.mark} understand capitalist [power
structures in **distinct ways** and]{.mark} therefore [lead to
**distinct political strategies**]{.mark}. More
importantly]{.underline}, however, "[doing both" **misreads** the
**balance of power** in America]{.underline} today: [institutionally on
the Left, we have nothing but a fraction of the already miniscule labor
movement to back our platform]{.underline} and our analysis.

[But liberalism has a major political party,]{.underline} the
[media]{.underline}, [academia]{.underline}, and [the entire world of
nonprofits]{.underline}, which today controls about as much wealth as
the Church did before the French Revolution. And [[**it's in the "do
both" strategy** that]{.mark} these **powerful enemies of the Left**
(and **[allies of capital]{.mark}**) [**worm their way** **into our
coalition** and **play up identity** to **reshape working-class
demands** until]{.mark} they're **[neutralized]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Haider fails to recognize the profound asymmetry between the power of
institutions of the working-class and the advocates of universal
class-based reforms, and those of the liberal establishment and their
own embrace of identity-based particularism. [Concretely, this asymmetry
does not lead to the best of identity politics and the best of universal
demands in some sort of synthesis]{.underline}. Instead, [the lopsided
advocacy for **[particularist demands]{.mark}** serves only to **further
[marginalize]{.mark} the [universalist demands]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

An [anticapitalist politics]{.underline} capable of fighting against
such forces [must appeal to the whole working class to build a mass
movement. Masses]{.underline} of people [become interested]{.underline}
in politics [when organizations offer a real possibility to change their
lives for the better. The only way to forge a movement **capable**
of]{.underline} achieving [that is by [fighting for **shared
working-**]{.mark}**class political and [economic
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This [remains the **only**
]{.mark}**plausible [path]{.mark}** [to **harnessing**]{.mark} the only
[**power**]{.mark} offered to workers in society: their position as an
exploited majority]{.underline}.

### AT: What Does The Alt Do/State Bad/Communism Fails

#### Alt generates a [policy feedback loop]{.underline} by forming a [solidarity state]{.underline} based in [democratic input]{.underline}, [public accountability]{.underline}, [reparative justice]{.underline}, and [collective ownership]{.underline}.

**Taylor and Hunt-Hendrix, 24**---co-founder of The Debt Collective;
senior advisor at the American Economic Liberties Project, founder of
Way to Win and Solidaire (Astra and Leah, "A Solidarity State,"
*Solidarity: The Past, Present, and Future of a World-Changing Idea*,
Chapter 6, pp. 213-215, dml)

[By emphasizing **democratic input** and
**accountability**]{.underline}, [a solidarity state poses an **equal
challenge** to actually existing capitalist and communist economic
paradigms]{.underline}, [both of which]{.underline}, despite their
immense and important differences, [**embolden** elite administrators
and profiteers]{.underline}. As Rosa Luxemburg warned in The Russian
Revolution, "[Public control is **indispensably
necessary**]{.underline}," [or]{.underline} else "[corruption becomes
**inevitable**]{.underline}."\[99\] In his famous study of the German
Social Democratic Party (the same party that Luxemburg battled with),
sociologist Robert Michels dubbed this tendency the "iron law of
oligarchy."\[100\] Michels argued that while individual socialists may
have won elections and influence--- gaining control over the party's
finances, press, and key positions---socialism lost.

Today in the U.S., the corruption Luxemburg warned of manifests whenever
elites monopolize access to ostensibly public resources or profit from
their absence: for example, by harnessing public banking to protect the
interests of the fossil fuel industry, as in the case of the Bank of
North Dakota, or reaping the rewards of the public housing voucher
system, as many corporate developers and landlords now do. [Cultivating
the **countervailing power** of solidarity is an **important tool** to
resist this oligarchic disposition]{.underline}. [A solidarity state
would ensure that anything]{.underline} "**[public]{.underline}**"
[involves a commitment to advancing **parity**]{.underline}, both in
terms of [promoting economic equity and power-sharing]{.underline},
[decentralizing capital]{.underline}, [and democratizing
control]{.underline}. [One]{.underline} inspiring [example]{.underline}
of this [is Costa Rica's]{.underline} Banco Popular y de Desarrollo
Comunal (**[BPDC]{.underline}**), which has been called
[the]{.underline} "[most democratic bank in the
world]{.underline}."\[101\] [A non-state but public
institution]{.underline}, [fully owned by]{.underline} the
[workers]{.underline} of Costa Rica, [it has a mandate to]{.underline}
"[serve the social and sustainable welfare of Costa Rican
inhabitants]{.underline}" [and is governed by a Workers'
Assembly]{.underline} made up of 290 individuals representing 10
different social and economic sectors. In line with the demands of the
solidarists and socialists of the late nineteenth century, [the Banco
Popular provides credit to]{.underline} workers, artisans, small
producers, communal development associations, municipalities,
cooperatives, unions, and development projects that
[benefit]{.underline} "**[collective welfare]{.underline}**," including
the welfare of the planet.\[102\]

Adding to their appeal, [more solidaristic and participatory governance
models not only help ensure **shared prosperity** and
**power**]{.underline}, [they also function as a **bulwark against elite
capture**]{.underline}. Paradoxically, pure state ownership can
sometimes make it easier for public goods to be destroyed for private
benefit by those who want to eliminate or sell them off (think of Bill
Clinton's destruction of tens of thousands of units of public
housing).\[103\] [We can see this in **Denmark**]{.underline}, [where
the majority of **utilities**]{.underline} (water, electricity, and
heat) [and]{.underline} a substantial portion of social [**housing** are
cooperatively owned]{.underline}, thanks to the efforts of workers'
movements past. According to former member of Danish Parliament Pelle
Dragsted, "[even if a neoliberal government **really wanted** to
commodify and privatise it]{.underline}, [they
**couldn't**]{.underline}, [because they didn't **own**
it]{.underline}."\[104\] Instead, these essential resources are in truly
public hands.

[The creation of public goods that are **accessible to everyone** has
the added benefit of]{.underline} what scholars call [a]{.underline}
"**[policy feedback loop]{.underline}**," a term for the ways [policy
**shapes consciousness** and **creates commitments** that can be
**difficult to change**]{.underline}, in ways both good and ill.
[Universal programs]{.underline}, like Social Security, [create a more
**solidaristic feedback loop**]{.underline}, while fragmented or
means-tested programs, like those to which welfare rights organizers
objected decades ago, reach narrowly defined groups and often create
confusion and resentment. [Broad and inclusive programs give people
**common stakes**]{.underline}, [creating constituencies that are
**invested** in **defending gains** from being rolled
back]{.underline}.\[105\] (They are also typically more cost-effective:
means-tested benefits are usually more expensive than universal ones
because of the costs associated with administrative systems that vet
applicants.)\[106\]

However, it is not enough for [policies and public goods]{.underline} to
be universal---as anthropologist Hannah Appel argues, they [also need to
be **reparative**]{.underline}.\[107\] To be truly equitable, [policies
and public goods must be structured in ways that **account for** and
seek to **redress** historical injustices and ongoing
disparities]{.underline}, which means they must explicitly acknowledge
the negative material consequences of racism, sexism, and ableism on
millions of people's lives. For example, in order to be reparative, [a
**job guarantee** might prioritize funding care work generally done by
women or cleaning up sites poisoned by environmental
racism]{.underline}, all based on the recognition that women and Black
people were left out of the New Deal. [A reparative approach to
**finance** would invest in communities and households that have long
been victims of predatory lending or denied access to
credit]{.underline}; [it could create social housing in neighborhoods
devastated by redlining or open public banks in neighborhoods currently
taken advantage of by payday lenders and check-cashing
companies]{.underline}. [A reparative resolution to **drug policy**
could take inspiration from **the 2022 Rhode Island** cannabis
legalization legislation that sets aside a substantial portion of
limited retail licenses for worker-owned businesses]{.underline}. [This
is the largest expansion of state support for cooperative enterprises in
recent history and a way of **explicitly ensuring** that income and
opportunities will flow to the low-income communities most harmed by the
War on Drugs]{.underline}.\[108\] [A reparative approach to **democracy
reform** might prioritize representational parity by instituting quotas
to ensure that]{.underline} women and people from [marginalized or
colonized communities have a political voice]{.underline}, as other
countries around the world do.

**Rosenberg, 22**---Associate Professor of Gender, Sexuality, and
Feminist Studies and History, Duke University (Gabriel, "The Lazy
Bear\'s Guide to Effective Anti-Imperialism,"
<https://bearistotle.substack.com/p/the-lazy-bears-guide-to-effective>,
dml)

[Because anti-war [rhetoric]{.mark} is **so easily abused** it [must be
**matched** by **institutional** and **material
commitments**]{.mark}]{.underline} you simply won't find in either
political party as they are currently constituted. Of course, [the
question of when military force is warranted is **not**]{.underline} a
**[simple]{.underline}** one. It's a moral question, entangled in
interpretation, speculation, and clouded by selfish interests. I tend to
answer it with strong skepticism of any and all military action, but I
wouldn't defend categorical pacifism. I think, for example, that US
entry into World War II was justified, as was decisive federal military
action against the treasonous slave power during the Civil War.
[Pacifism is a fine way to evaluate military action]{.underline}...
[right up until there's a **good** and **justified reason** for the use
of force]{.underline}. When pushed, many pacifists will admit that there
probably are conditions under which they would endorse a military
response (Nazis! Invading xenocidal lizard people! All of the above!).
[Practical pacifists and warmongers are **not always rhetorically
distinguishable**]{.underline}: [both may well describe military action
as a lamentable final course of action prompted by exceptional
danger]{.underline}. Given this, how can we ensure that military force
is, in fact, the exceptional course of action?

[My recommendation is to [**concretize** skepticism]{.mark} of
militarism in **institutional arrangements**]{.underline}, [[to **bend
institutional defaults** away from militarism]{.mark} such that
war-making capacities must be fabricated before they can be deployed and
are starkly limited in duration]{.underline}. In simpler terms, [[it
should be **politically**]{.underline}, **[socially]{.underline}**, [and
**logistically difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for politicians [to
prosecute a war and we should **organize**]{.mark} **government
[agencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [including **budgets**]{.underline},
[to reflect this]{.underline}]{.mark} [fact]{.underline}. That's a good
reason not to deploy troops to Ukraine, but it's also a good reason not
to fund the military as we do.

This is, to a great extent, a practical lesson I take from the history
of the two military engagements I named above as justifiable. Both the
Civil War and World War II were watershed moments in the construction of
American state capacity. In both cases, the Federal government was faced
with such a pressing military danger that it had to whip up popular
support for military action and constitute a fighting force. That
entailed dramatic and unpopular disruptions of daily life in which
average citizens were expected to subordinate their own interests to
those of the state and war effort. And it required the creation of vast
new state bureaucracies and unprecedented interventions in the national
economy. And it also involved important and persistent constitutional
reorderings that fundamentally altered the shape of how lawmaking,
courts, and ordered liberty functioned. In the case of the Civil War,
many of those constitutional and governmental reorganizations were ended
in a premature fashion, leading to the failure of Reconstruction. But in
the case of World War II, the United States never really wound down what
historian James T. Sparrow terms "the warfare state," instead rolling it
into, first, the Cold War State and, now, the National Security State. I
think that was a grievous error precisely because it has allowed 80
years of conniving and opportunistic politicians to free-ride on the
necessary national mobilization executed by Roosevelt. We no longer need
to reorganize American society to prosecute a war; we often need to
reorganize it just to prevent a war. [We have made it **easy** for
politicians and generals to start wars because the **unchecked
institutional default** is to lavish improbable sums of money
on]{.underline} the military and defense contractors and to stock their
bases with missiles and jets just waiting to be used. (Not that the jets
always work.) Even when we don't have a hot conflict going, [our war
machine]{.underline} is the Chekov's gun of American political theater.

[[This]{.mark} institutional context [makes]{.mark} so much anti-war
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}, my own included, **[[fine words scolding
the storm]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This rhetoric is **too [easily
appropriated]{.mark}** [by warmongers]{.mark} and deployed [as a
**partisan cudgel**]{.mark} to criticize the party in
power]{.underline}, [only to see the ascendant party make use of the
same military apparatus]{.underline} when it has taken control. This was
(and remains) a regular criticism of the Obama Administration in some
quarters. If you'll recall, Obama had campaigned as a credible critic of
the disastrous invasion of Iraq. Along with a majority of the Democratic
Senate caucus, Hilary Clinton had voted in favor of the Authorization of
Military Force Resolution (2002), while Obama, still a state senator at
the time, had not. I wouldn't exactly call Obama's rhetoric dovish, but
it inspired some (imho unwarranted) optimism among Democratic voters as
well as some vitriolic criticism from the Right. Depending on how much
hope one invested in Obama's foreign policy, the succeeding eight years
were possibly disappointing, with the Obama Administration sustaining an
open-ended military presence in Afghanistan and asserting the right to
engage in drone strikes, bombings, and targeted assassinations whenever
they felt national security required it. If one believes the Glenn
Greenwalds of the world, Obama's foreign policy and commitment to the
national security state was a seamless extension of Bush II's and most
Democratic media types were all too willing to forget about US
militarism once their own guy was in the White House. Greenwald now also
makes the same criticism of the Biden Administration and the current
Democratic party. One needn't agree entirely with Greenwald's
assessment---you may justifiably prefer Obama's foreign policy to Bush's
and Biden's to Trump's on the particulars---to, nevertheless, recognize
that, however Obama and Biden deploy the American war machine, both are
unflinching about maintaining America's capacity to unleash massive
amounts of violence on the rest of the world.

Neither Obama nor Biden are unusual in this regard. Senator Bernie
Sanders has long been sneeringly dismissed in national media as a loony
leftist, despite his persistent national popularity, because he has been
a stalwart critic of defense spending. He has been politically isolated
and marginalized for his longstanding commitment to reducing America's
capacity to make war. But maintaining such a capacity, at extraordinary
expense in lives, liberties, and lucre, has been a near constant in
American political life since World War II. Recent military actions as
part of the "War on Terror" have cost the US \$9 trillion and killed
more than 900,000 people in the last two decades alone. But the National
Security State remains the ideological and institutional container
within which partisan disagreements play out and that has been so, at
least within the narrow band of respectable national politics, for the
past 80 years without serious interruption. People may disagree with how
to deploy the American war machine. Some even believe---earnestly and
resolutely---that America should rarely deploy it and is or has been
badly misguided in deploying it in the past. The arguments in polite
political society, however, remain focused on the when of
deployment---"now? no!"---and rarely pose the more fundamental question:
should the United States maintain a war machine at all? That's a shame.
Just as the most effective deterrent to driving a Lamborghini is to not
have a Lamborghini in your garage, the most effective deterrent to US
militarism would be for the United States not to have a war machine.

And what a war machine it is! The amount of money the US government has
invested in its military is truly mind-boggling. It is beyond counting.
No really. Pentagon spending has never been audited. Current Department
of Defense annual discretionary expenditures are \$770 billion, but a
fuller tabulation, including things like the Homeland Security, Veterans
Affairs, and the Department of Energy's contributions to the nuclear
arsenal, could put the total annual tab at nearly \$1.2 trillion
conservatively estimated. It is true, as hawks are fond to note, that
current spending on defense is lower than it has been for most of the
past century when taken as a percentage of GDP. And it's also true that
the US spends a smaller portion of its GDP on its military than do Saudi
Arabia, Israel, and Russia. Yes, that's all true... and an unpersuasive
rationale for current spending levels! The US has the largest economy in
the world. The US economy is 14 times larger than Russia's and almost 50
times the size of Israel's. You don't fight wars as a percentage of GDP.
It's the absolute size of your military that matters and the US war
machine towers over everyone else. When we move past the percentage of
GDP smudge, you'll notice that Russia spends only about \$60 billion
annually on its military, a mere 5% (!!!) of the \$1.2 trillion total US
tab I mentioned above. And even that understates the relative difference
in size since decades of capital investments in military infrastructure
and equipment compose the unrivaled total assets of the US military.
Sure, the military is a huge sinkhole of waste and fraud, but it also
owns a bunch of stuff! The (unaudited) Department of Defense's own
(probably low-balled) accounting suggests it holds \$3.2 trillion in
total assets, a sum that is only about 50 times as large as Russia's
annual military expenditures.

Given this context, my own sense is that [[critiques]{.mark} of US
military actions [are too concerned with]{.mark} the **[ideological
rationales]{.mark}** for particular actions]{.underline}, [[and
not]{.mark} concerned [enough with **institutional design** and
**material interests**]{.mark} that mobilize them]{.underline}[. [I
**doubt**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**very much** that [we are likely
to]{.mark} **radically [alter the]{.mark} guiding [ideology]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} America's political
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}---there's a longer post on this yet to
come but even Trumpkins are the weird, spoiled fruit of
liberalism---[but [even if we did]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[institutional inertia]{.mark} alone** [could]{.mark} still
[overdetermine a]{.mark} **casually [fatal
militarism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Transaction costs
are]{.mark} an **important deterrent** to action]{.underline}---[perhaps
[the **most important** deterrent]{.mark} from an institutional
perspective]{.underline}---and 80 years of defense spending has helped
to radically reduce the transaction costs of military action. Indeed, in
the case of the invasion of Iraq, some portion of our political
leadership was captured by a sunk cost fallacy: We'd already spent
trillions on the war machine, so why not put it to some use and, in
Jonah Goldberg's shameful and abhorrent quote of Michael Ledeen, "pick
up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just
to show the world we mean business." Because, why not? What's the worst
that could happen? The institutional gravity of a \$3.2 trillion dollar
war machine is such that if you keep one in your garage, the particular
reasons to use it will find you.

[Knowing that Iraq and the global War on Terror were very bad wars
**only gets us so far** since it seems **inevitable** that]{.underline},
[[at some point]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[politicians and voters]{.mark}
both [will be enthusiastic about **other bad
wars**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[**how will we stop
those**?]{.underline}]{.mark} As I have already stipulated, [the
**fine-tuned adjudication** of the rights and wrongs of future military
actions requires a level of expertise that is **currently unavailable**
to most American citizens]{.underline}. I agree with folks such as
Daniel Bessner and Stephen Wertheim that a huge part of the problem is
that average American citizens are excluded from influencing American
foreign policy and that to turn away from endless war we need to
effectively "democratize" that debate. We can lament the fact that the
average American is both ignorant about world affairs and, at once,
profoundly alienated from participating in [**[debate]{.mark}s** about
foreign policy]{.underline}. But it remains the reality, the good work
of the Quincy Institute notwithstanding. In the meantime, that
adjudication, rarely fine-tuned in national media discourse, [[is run
through with **bad faith actors**]{.mark} [who]{.mark} are interested in
advancing their partisan interests]{.underline}, [[lack a **sincere
desire** to reduce]{.mark} US [military action]{.mark}
abroad]{.underline}, [[and may convert]{.mark} **[political
capital]{.mark} accrued [through such criticisms]{.mark}** into
**advancing [the interests]{.mark}** [of that military]{.mark} apparatus
in the **near future**]{.underline}. Similarly, my gloss is that the
removal of voters and citizens from foreign policy decision making is
part and parcel of the redesign of the American state during World War
II. In this sense, allowing citizens to shape foreign policy would
require not just a change in attitudes by both elites and average
citizens, but, in a deeper sense, it would require a broader
reorganization of the American state, its boundaries and objectives, and
the interests and constituencies it serves. There's some reason to be
optimistic that such a reorganization would be broadly popular with
American voters. But, as of yet, there is simply little institutional
support for dramatic military spending cuts from within either major
political party. The centrist and wonkish wings of the Democratic party
don't yet seem to recognize anti-militarism as a potential component of
a "popularist" agenda, despite the popularity of cutting defense
spending. But absent an effort to meaningfully reduce that spending,
arguments about military action---which ones to support and which ones
to denounce---are destined to be chafe in America's own spiraling
Forever Culture War, based less on a serious reflection on the
catastrophic touch of American power and more on a gestural affinity for
your team's current imperial enthusiasms.

[[Effective anti-imperialism will **radically reduce** the size of
the]{.mark} American [military or it will do
**nothing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[anyone who fails to endorse such
an approach is **unserious** about]{.mark} how to temper the [military
violence]{.mark} American unleashes on the world]{.underline}. Those
statements lays out [the monumental nature of the task]{.underline} in
no uncertain terms, and I hope their clarity offers you something of
value. At the very least, it [gives you a ready-at-hand instrument to
distinguish]{.underline} the **[opportunistic criticisms]{.underline}**
of the Hawleys, Carlsons, and Vances, on the one hand, [from the
**difficult political commitments** that]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [would effectively reduce militarism in the longer
term]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} is a [distinction]{.underline}
that seems increasingly lost on Glenn Greenwald, but it [remains
**critical** to articulating an effective anti-imperial
politics]{.underline}.

**James, 97**---Ebenezer Fitch Professor of Humanities at Williams
College (Joy, "Radicalism and Black Intellectual Life," *Transcending
the Talented Tenth: Black Leaders and American Intellectuals*,
Conclusion, 185-187, dml)

Today, identity [[claims to radicalism are made **irrespective**
of]{.mark} any]{.underline} \"**[[careful]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[sober [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" [[to analyze the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}, its institutions and populace. Sometimes
claims are issued [because of the intellectual\'s **distance** from
confrontations with state repression]{.underline}. [[As **subversive
lifestyles**]{.mark} and **speech** [pose as **surrogates** for]{.mark}
political [activism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [disconnected from political
organizing]{.underline}, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to function as
performance, and in performance [[**reinscribe** subordinates as]{.mark}
**entertainers**]{.underline}, **[[spectacles]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[or **objects** of discourse]{.underline}. [[Speech acts]{.mark} or
rhetoric as political acts]{.underline}, though political, [[are **not
inherently radical**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Speech acts **hardly function** as a form of political]{.underline} (as
opposed to rhetorical) [radicalism when **severed** from the struggles
of nonelite communities]{.underline}. To explore this \"activism\'s\"
relationship to political organizing, we must ask and answer a number of
questions. How do we distinguish between the experiential acts in
political organizing that create the subject matter for the radical
rhetorician and the literature or speech that is commodified as black
revolutionary performance? How does mere teaching or writing about
radicalism within a corporate institution qualify one as a \"radical\"?
How does the literary or academic radicalism of elites supersede or
mitigate the radical acts of nonelites that create the subject matter
for their work? Without the rhetorician, radicalism continues, but can
the rhetorician make meaningful claims to radicalism without the agency
of the activist?

Noting the differences between the theorizing of intellectuals engaged
and those removed from community organizing, we see that [progressive
[intellectuals who **restrict**]{.mark} their political [interventions
to speech acts may **claim** the title of radical]{.mark}
activist]{.underline}; [[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the radical
rhetorician is **not necessarily** the engagé]{.underline}. [Redefining
radical activism as the **literary production** of nonactivists
is]{.underline} apt to be a **[disingenuous]{.underline}** political
act. [[If intellectuals need only **declare themselves**]{.mark} **as
[militant]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} be **recognized** by or
**[organize]{.mark}** with activists]{.underline}, [then
[politics]{.mark} as a phenomena [is **supplanted**]{.mark} by the
individualism of the political egoist]{.underline}. The extremes to
which progressives take the American ideology, or cult, of individualism
are noted by Manning Marable, who writes: \"Among many white and black
American intellectuals, [there exists a profound bias towards
**individualism** as opposed to **collective action**]{.underline}.\"

Like Marable, David Bromwich\--who argues that it is difficult to know
what radicals would be, given their scarcity\--notes the problematizing
of American [radicalism filtered through individualism]{.underline}. For
Bromwich, \"words are acts that change our lives\";7 yet he also writes
that since Emerson, U.S. literary radicalism\'s social reform rarely
collaborated \"with the short-term plans of reformers.:\" According to
Bromwich, cultural radicalism is more prevalent than political
radicalism because Americans are inclined towards the avant-garde or
radical individualism:? although, American cultural individualism
produces a bewilderment that is \"paid for by the eclecticism, the
impatient or capricious energy, and above all the discontinuity of our
radicalism in politics.\"!?

The privileging of free agents and free enterprise radicalism
[**overshadows** the organized efforts of nonelite community thinkers
and activists]{.underline}. Contemporary [black intellectuals\'
[constructions of resistance as]{.mark} rhetoric or [artistic expression
**problematize political agency**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} constructions [signal a **break** with
the]{.underline} notions of race leadership tied to the Talented
Tenth\'s **[pragmatic function]{.underline}**. [[Since such radicalism
**rarely leaves the campus**]{.mark} or **lecture hall**]{.underline},
[[it]{.mark} often [transpires within the **enclaves of
academe**]{.mark}]{.underline} or publishing. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark}
therefore [[constitutes a **flight** from]{.mark} traditional [forms of
politics in which **relevance was gauged by the intellectual\'s
intervention in collective struggle with others**]{.mark} to contravene
community crises]{.underline}.

Cambridge; professor of Social Theory at the University of Cambridge

during democratisation movements," Theory and Society, Volume 53 (2024),

Similar to Ghalioun, Paris-based academic Samira Mobaied (2018) believed
[it was **particularly important** that]{.underline} Syrian
[intellectuals undertake a **direct** role]{.underline}. 'A leap has
been taken and [if we remain at [the level of **intellectual
participation**]{.mark} in the struggle]{.underline}, [we will [remain
**outside**]{.mark} what takes place within **[political
organisations]{.mark}** and this puts us at a
**disadvantage**]{.underline},' she explains. Like Ghalioun, Mobaied has
been an active member in oppositionist organisations, including the High
Negotiations Committee of the Syrian Opposition.

[Most]{.underline} other [intellectuals **avoided** membership in any
such organisations]{.underline} Footnote 15 and defended their decision
[by adhering to the view that political loyalties are **inherently
incompatible**]{.underline} with scholarship's long cherished aspiration
for detachment (for more on this view see Schaar & Wolin, 1963). Others
were more pragmatic in their reasoning: their concern was that in the
absence of an oppositional political legacy, i.e., parties, alliances
[and]{.underline} networks that could support them, any such involvement
would have been [**predestined** to failure]{.underline} Footnote 16.

If you see, any of those intellectuals who joined the \[Syrian
National\] Council, ... they joined as individuals, not as members of a
party. Whereas we would be working in exile with organised people who
have financial and political support from entire states. What can we
contribute in such a setting? Nothing. Except become a toy in their
hands, and that's exactly what happened to them \[in reference to
intellectuals who joined in a private capacity\]. (Farouk Mardam
BeyFootnote 17, personal communication, 2018)

In other words, without the support of a party, intellectuals thought
that getting involved in the political organisations would restrict them
to a weak and nominal role. But this was not the only reason for their
reluctance: [[the idea of **radical embeddedness**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the related ideal of '[the]{.underline} deliberately
**[leaderless character]{.underline}**' of the movement (Glasius &
Pleyers, 2013) [was also crucial]{.underline}.

'Leaderlessness' was celebrated by [many revolutionary
intellectuals]{.underline} who [**explicitly refused** leadership
roles]{.underline} and denounced iconic positions within the movement.
As an example, one might refer to Yassin al-Haj Saleh's article
celebrating a statement by the late activist and actress Fadwa Sulaiman
in which she rejects reference to her as an 'icon of the revolutionary
Alawite'. Paraphrasing her words, Saleh writes: 'Truly amazing: "I'm not
an idol! I'm Fadwa! Like life! I have a lover! Down with icons and long
live freedom! I'm a rebel!" ... She frames her refusal to become an idol
within the broader context of Syrians' movement to tear down all idols!'
(al-Haj Saleh, 2011).

[This]{.underline} distinctive [outlook]{.underline} which emphasises
resistance to hierarchies also [recognises intellectuals and their
publics as **epistemic equals**]{.underline} (Baert & Susen, 2017, p.
41). It has been suggested that the Arab [revolutions were [**centred**
around]{.mark}]{.underline} the idea of building a new social contract
whereby law becomes 'an [[expression of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
people's [**[solidarity]{.underline}**']{.mark} [rather
than]{.underline} the '**[sovereignty]{.underline}** of any upright or
righteous person or group (a charismatic leader)' (Shahin cited in
Glasius & Pleyers, 2013, p. 557). This hostility towards political
leadership was particularly pronounced among Syrian intellectuals, who
had since the 1990s gradually adopted 'an ethos of ... social
embeddedness' (Kassab, 2019, p.115). Rosa Yaseen-Hassan (2018) puts it
in a broader context when she suggests it was a 'revolt against the
personification \[of movements\] and mythologisation \[of leaders\]'
that led Syrians to reject the idea of leadership within the movement.
This perception of anti-leadership sentiments among their publics
contributed to intellectuals' inclination toward advocacy interventions
and trauma work, as if in anticipation of their impending devaluation
within this wave of anti-leadership and ultimately anti-intellectualist
sentiments.

Unsurprisingly, [for those who were **organisationally engaged** in the
movement]{.underline}, [its leaderless character was seen as a
**failing** rather than something to **celebrate**]{.underline}; [one
which [created a **leadership vacuum**]{.mark} that was [quickly
occupied by **reactionary**]{.mark} and **undemocratic
[forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As we mentioned earlier, Ghalioun
offered one such argument. While he is no exception to the tension
between egalitarianism and vanguardism that is inherent to the role of
public intellectual, Ghalioun's egalitarianism does not trump his belief
in the intellectual's responsibility. In his reply to a letter blaming
intellectuals for legitimising a movement that led to destruction and
death, Ghalioun contends that Syrian
[[intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark} are not to blame for spreading
emancipatory ideals and hopes (as his critic had indicated). Rather,
they [[**failed** to perform a **guiding role** that might **direct**
the movement]{.mark} towards positive goals [and prevent]{.mark} it from
falling into the pits of [**sectarianism** and
**vengefulness**]{.mark}]{.underline} toward which the regime was
driving it. They are to blame, he says, for 'leaving the people almost
entirely leaderless' (Ghalioun, 2018a, b).

It is worth noting that [among many of those who **initially**
celebrated]{.underline} the revolution's
'**[leaderlessness]{.underline}**', [a sense of **regret** gradually
emerged]{.underline}. It was reflected in a self-questioning sentiment
that prevailed in the public sphere in the past few years and in the
repeated call for collective self-reflection and revision (muaraja'at).
This self-reflection had at least in part to do with having failed to
play a more effective role in preserving the movement's emancipatory
framing i.e. performing an intellectual leadership role. In a group
article published on the 8th anniversary of the revolution, a number of
exiled artists, [writers and activists]{.underline} wrote that the
greatest lesson of the revolution was that they had [**overstated**
the]{.underline} '**[logic of deferral]{.underline}**': that is, [they
now **regretted** [this tendency to **refrain** from critiquing]{.mark}
reactionary forces within the revolution so as [to maintain a **united
front**]{.mark} until the fall of the regime]{.underline}. 'We did not
pay attention to the importance of fighting the battle for personal
freedoms early on, before the conservative current -- an imperially
orientated force of course - led by the Islamist authoritarians was able
to sideline us' (Tansiqiyet-Alfenuidash, 2019). In other words, their
greatest regret was that [they [**failed to intervene authoritatively**
at the **right time**]{.mark} for fear that their views **contravened**
anti-leadership sentiments or **contradicted** those of certain
audiences seen as important in the fight]{.underline} against the
regime.

Despite avoidance of political leadership and scepticism towards
intellectuals' role in organised politics, intellectuals, particularly
of the middle and older generations, insisted on an Arendtian
understanding of political life as integral to the human experience.
They repeatedly highlighted the importance of ending Syria's
'politicide' and enabling the resurrection of free political action and
discourse in Syria. [They problematised [a **lack of enthusiasm**
towards political organisation]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in
exile, sometimes [attributing it to a state of [**generalised despair**
and a]{.mark}]{.underline} ['**[conviction that it's all
useless]{.underline}**']{.mark} (Farouk Mardam Bey, personal
communication, 2018). At the same time, with few exceptions, they
refrained from political organising for the movement themselves.

Al-Haj Saleh (2014b) who has remained outside organised political work
since his release from prison in 1996, critiques the abstention from
political work among the Syrian youth and intellectuals and
problematises the way they are 'supposedly devoting themselves instead
to issues of thought, literature and art' or to ostensibly nonpartisan
NGO work. He attributes overall withdrawal from politics in Syria to a
regime-led strategy which has isolated the public from politics by
administering a regime of chronic trauma surrounding the political;
'through intimidation, fear, corruption and abuse; or by feeding public
scepticism about politics and politicians'. [This strategy]{.underline},
he suggests, [has resulted in a **fraught** relationship to
politics]{.underline}, evoking images of 'power and domination',
'fickleness', 'corruption', and 'elitist detachment from people's
lives'. He admits to not being 'outside of this condition which he
criticises' and to having repeatedly stated that he works exclusively
with cultural, not political tools. He also recognises that in this way
he is 'complicit in limiting the field of politics and hindering its
overdue expansion which the revolution has made possible'. Nevertheless,
he offers no explanation for his own position outside the organised
politics of the movement.

Similarly, Farouk Mardam Bey, who has been living in France since 1965
and remains outside the political organisations of the Syrian
revolution, argued as follows:

The Syrian state wanted politics to end, for people to become
disinterested in politics except in the scope of applauding the ruler.
But politics is an essential part of life, and it cannot be restricted
to the cultural field... political change inside Syria requires
political organising. (Farouk Mardam Bey, personal communication, 2018)

In addition to previously cited concerns about external support and
party membership, this contradictory position vis-à-vis political
engagement may also be linked with what Hösle (2016, p. 375) calls 'the
true dilemma of the public intellectual' arguing that alliances are
necessary if the public intellectual is to have an impact on the
political arena. But joining a platform means having to make concessions
which compromise intellectual independence and sometimes result in
self-deception when intellectuals 'come even to believe what at the
beginning was only a concession to the would-be ally' (Ibid).

It may be said that this 'true dilemma of the public intellectual' at
least partially reflects the experience of Burhan Ghalioun who faced a
choice between attempting to influence the movement through intellectual
work and making a direct political impact through his leadership of the
Syrian National Council, and who clearly prioritised the latter. To
borrow from Hösle (2016 p. 376), 'between magnificent loneliness with
the dim chance of a long-term impact and immediate effect at the expense
of depth', he chose 'immediate effect'. He ended up making concessions
which fundamentally contradicted his intellectual position such as
aligning with the Muslim Brotherhood, justifying the acceptance of Gulf
funding or purportedly resorting to authoritarian leadership strategies.
Whilst acknowledging that 'intellectual work is meaningful and
politically fruitful' he was also aware that 'it is long term work' and
he found it to be a 'selfish' activity in a context like 2011 Syria
(personal communication, 2018). He explains in our interview,

I could have stayed outside and said I am not a politician. I could have
written 4 or 5 books throughout this period. But that would have been a
betrayal not only to my people but also to my own principles. I have
been writing about democracy and mass movements for 40 or 50 years, I
cannot stand on the margin when the moment comes, when people finally
decide to claim their freedoms ... Intellectuals are answerable for
staying on the margins of the revolution instead of throwing themselves
into it so that others don't take the lead and drive the revolution into
catastrophe as they did. Why did the Islamists take control? Because the
intellectuals didn't. (personal communication, 2018)

For most other exilic intellectuals, alternative forms of engagement
replaced political ones, leaving them first and foremost with the role
of 'carrier group' in the cultural trauma construction process (on the
role of intellectuals as cultural trauma carriers see also Ushiyama &
Baert, 2016; Baert, 2015; Eyerman, 1994). In this capacity, they
operated in the public sphere - not political organisations - and
focused on articulating claims, representing interests and desires, and
trying to uphold the movement's emancipatory framing. They became part
of a much broader and less and insular collectivity as the description
'intellectual' no longer referred to a structurally determined group or
personality type but to a group of actors mediating between the cultural
and political spheres, 'not so much representing and giving voice to
their own ideas and interests, but rather articulating ideas to and for
others' (Eyerman, 2003, p. 3). This shift towards trauma work,
particularly in its tragic form can be seen as both a cause and a result
of the embedded position. It partially fuelled embeddedness because
doing trauma work necessitated identification and compassion with the
suffering masses. And it was partly a result of embeddedness in that
trauma work became feasible once they abandoned their role as critics
and leaders of the revolutionary movement.

As a final note on the relationship between intellectuals' limited
political role and the embedded position, we contend that [the
combination of revolutionary thinking and abstention from applied
politics]{.underline}, [[reduced intellectuals to]{.underline}]{.mark}
what John McGowan might call '[**[sentimental
radicalism]{.underline}**']{.mark} - an extension of his term
'sentimental socialism' (McGowan, 2016, p. 127). Indeed, [their
political stance was **sentimental** in that [it did not provide a
**robust**]{.mark} **intellectual** and **programmatic
[description]{.mark}** [of how]{.mark} political [transition will be
**achieved**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Syria, [[nor a vision of a
**desired** and **plausible**]{.underline}]{.mark} Syrian
[[society]{.mark} to be aspired for]{.underline} after that transition.
[This is in no small part attributable to the **absence** of a **clear
political ideology** that can offer a **shared vision** of what progress
looks like]{.underline}: if many intellectuals across the world adhered
to socialism in the second part of the twentieth century, their
political ideology today is 'vague at best' (Ibid).

Cultural trauma and anti-intellectual populism

[In **lieu** of ideational leadership or organised political
action]{.underline}, [**cultural trauma construction** took centre
stage]{.underline}. In line with the latter's drive to clearly assign
victims and perpetrators, an amorphous construct of 'the people' was
presented not only as the victim of a brutal dictatorship but also as a
heroic figure with an emancipatory movement: the 'popular' as an
identity 'enters into the making of subaltern political agency' (Ismail,
2013, p. 891). For many intellectuals, [[the focus
was]{.underline}]{.mark} now [not on how to **inform**]{.underline},
**[enlighten]{.underline}**, [or **liberate**]{.underline} '[the
people]{.underline}' [but [on how to **support**]{.mark}
them]{.underline}, [**[follow their lead]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [[and
**further their cause**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[**[Appealing]{.mark}** to [and]{.mark}/or **[aligning]{.mark}**
with]{.underline} '[the people]{.underline}' was significantly energised
by structural changes in the public sphere enabled by new technologies.
In this new public sphere, engaged publics [[became]{.mark} **more
powerful than ever** in determining]{.underline} not only an
intellectual's success but also [[what constitutes a]{.underline}
'**[successful]{.underline}**']{.mark}
[[intellectual]{.underline}]{.mark} (Baert & Booth, 2012, p. 15). One
can then suppose that intellectuals were writing in ways that resonated
with the public, connected emotionally with them, and could lead to
positive uptake, diffusion and **[[symbolic
recognition]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Baert, 2015, pp.132--133). Among
pro-movement publics, a positive emotional response was most likely to
occur through narratives that honoured their suffering, aestheticized
their tragedy, and maintained unconditional solidarity towards them. At
least between 2012 and 2014, when a growing Jihadist discourse provided
not only symbolic validation of armed resistance but also enabled its
material actualisation, eliciting a positive emotional response from
their publics meant that oppositionist intellectuals would have to
continue to avoid critical interventions concerning the emergence of a
Jihadist discourse. The implication here is not that this form of
quietism about the movement's developments was strategic or aimed at
maximising an intellectual's popularity and success. A more plausible
explanation would be that it simply seemed like 'the decent thing to do
', for at least two reasons. Firstly, Jihadist discourse was the only
discourse out there which resonated with the revolutionaries' need for
defensive violence. Secondly, anti-Jihadist discourse had long been the
turf of the regime and its intellectuals and reproducing it would
jeopardise the intellectuals' pro-revolution positioning. Avoiding
misalignment with the movement's Islamist component [reflects a tendency
on the part of the intellectuals to [**defer judgement** and
**leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} to 'the people' [as part of their
self-positioning as **embedded intellectuals** narrating collective
trauma from within]{.underline}.

This positioning synergised with the emergence of a form of
anti-intellectualist populism; intellectuals were blamed for the
failures of the revolution. Populism in this context refers to a type of
cultural fetishism of the masses rather than a political programme or
approach. [Rather than being **actively
anti-establishment**]{.underline}, [it is more about **minimising
disagreement**]{.underline} with the majority of the populace [and
**avoiding controversial matters**]{.underline}. It entails a desire to
appeal to 'ordinary people,' for instance by using simple language and
popular cultural references. More problematically, [it
construes]{.underline} 'the people' as [a **monolithic** and
**distinct** entity]{.underline}, [attributes certain traits to it and
tends to **support it uncritically** and
**unconditionally**]{.underline}.

This self-positioning was sometimes influenced by a narrative in which
intellectuals were held responsible for the destruction caused by the
failure of the revolution. The following excerpt from a letter addressed
to Burhan Ghalioun summarises this narrative. After blaming
intellectuals for the 'destruction, killing and displacement' which the
revolution brought with it, the letter explains:

At first, you \[intellectuals\] inspired hope and made us dream of a
developed, modern, and secular Syria. People like you who have entered
people's hearts and minds using their refined personalities have
motivated them to reject the regime. But the way I see it, it would have
been better for all of us if things had remained the same. You did not
understand the Syrian people and could not see how steeped they are in
the ignorance of religiosity, blind intolerance, tribal and sectarian
belongings, and by misreading the people, you brought the country and
the people to the abyss (cited in Ghalioun, 2018a, b).

It is worth noting that while such anti-intellectualism was evident in
document analysis and frequently brought up in interviews, many of the
participants in this study were critical about it, even when they
critiqued other intellectuals, groups of intellectuals, or 'Syrian
intellectuals' as such.

A case in point is Yassin al-Haj Saleh who having voiced his
disappointment with intellectuals on various occasions remained vigilant
concerning blanket anti-intellectualism.

I notice that there persists a populist discourse against intellectuals;
one that is also exercised by some intellectuals. I find that very
unfortunate... It may have always been present, but it wasn't as visible
nor was it as openly expressed as it is now after the revolution. This
could be attributable to the emergence of social media which enabled
large segments of society, hundreds of thousands, to enter into the
field of public affairs. (personal communication, 2018)

Some suggested that anti-intellectualism was entangled with Baathist
rule and its problematic relationship to culture. Liwaa YazjiFootnote 18
(personal communication, 2018) explains that intellectualism has long
been a delicate topic in the militarised society under Baath party rule.
She suggests that a pretence of intellectualism and an appropriation of
culture operated in tandem with a contempt for them as bourgeois
constructs. A systematic trivialisation of intellectualism went hand in
hand with its pretence, Yazji explains. As a secular party, the Baath
wanted to monopolise culture. But as a rural marginalised minority,
Assad's Alawite sect nursed deep resentment towards intellectuals as
traditionally urban middle-class. This resentment came from the
knowledge that 'they can never fully own it \[culture\]' because, as
Yazji suggests, 'the deeper your knowledge, the more inevitable it will
become that you will take a stance against the Baath party.'

AzmehFootnote 19, distinguishes anti-intellectualism as a generalised
sentiment from the construction of intellectuals as 'traitors'. He
contends that generalised animosity towards intellectualism is prevalent
among intellectuals themselves. It manifested in an environment where
'tanzeer' or theorising became an offence and attempts at even the most
slightly complex analysis or synthesis were dismissed as pretentious
elitist performances. He contrasts these anti-intellectual sentiments
among intellectuals with the public's 'largely positive views of culture
and of intellectuals' from whom they 'wish to learn,' and to whom they
'have a thirst to listen, contrary to what the populist intellectuals
claim' (personal communication, 2018). He differentiates, however,
between this type of intellectual anti-intellectualism and the
construction of intellectuals as traitors which he explains as a natural
'reaction to positions like those of AdonisFootnote 20 and to a past in
which many intellectuals were accomplice to the regime, presented as
progressive leftists but in effect no more than silent witnesses to its
atrocities.' It is the former type of anti-intellectual populism, Azmeh
concludes, that weakened the influence of intellectual interventions
concerning the movement and limited their reach and impact. As such, he
adds, it was largely responsible for the absence of an intellectual
leadership for the movement and a clear working programme beyond the
general demand of bringing down the dictatorship initially put forth by
the protestors. What was missing, he asserts, was a 'compass or perhaps
several compasses; ... a multiplicity in which different currents might
interact with each other and offer a sense of deliberated direction.' He
contends that anti-intellectualism's prevalence is highest within a
circle of intellectuals whom the regime had co-opted but who later sided
with the revolution. 'They were part of an intellectual body which the
regime patronaged to some extent, regularly persecuting radical voices
whenever they emerged from it' (personal communication, 2018). The
implication is that intellectuals' anti-intellectualism was often an act
of retroactive atonement for past guilt; a rejection of an identity now
deemed complicit with the regime.

Indeed, as some participants observed, anti-intellectualism transposed
past culturalist critique of Syrian society or Arab culture into its
opposite: a type of fetishism of the masses. Sulafa HijaziFootnote 21
describes how after the revolution, 'elitist ideas became unethical and
everything popular became the new elite.' (personal communication, 2018)
Similarly, Salam KawakibiFootnote 22 suggested that 'Syrian
intellectuals went straight from elitism to populism' and instead of
playing a meaningful role in the popular movement of 2011, 'they started
to transform their discourse from a complicated esoteric one to a
populist one' which is 'inflammatory, oversimplistic, and nebulous'.
(personal communication, 2018).

Samira MoubayedFootnote 23 speaks critically of populism among
intellectuals pointing that it is mostly noticeable 'among older
intellectuals, especially those who were imprisoned for a long time.'
She attributes it to a dependence on and vital connection with the
masses: intellectuals have become so committed to protecting this
relationship that they always side with and are always influenced by the
tendencies of the masses no matter what course they might take 'even if
it was in the wrong direction.' Moubayed attributes this inclination to
'follow' rather than lead to an 'organic relationship with the masses
which makes the intellectual's very existence dependent on it.' Moubayed
suggests that their concern is that 'If they disagreed with the popular
opinion, they might lose some of their popularity which is very
important to them. Thus, they somewhat internalise popular views and are
influenced by the street.' (personal communication, 2018)

Conclusion

This paper has argued that after the 2011 revolution, particularly after
its violent turn and first wave of exile, [the leadership role of
intellectuals was **seriously questioned**]{.underline} by both
intellectuals and their publics. [Trauma narration took **centre
stage**]{.underline}, [fostering an ideal of **[radical epistemic
egalitarianism]{.mark}** and **embeddedness**]{.underline} within
society. This resulted in two complications. At the cultural-epistemic
level, [it **[softened]{.mark}** the nature of intellectual
[interventions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**undermining** their]{.mark}
ideational [influence]{.mark} upon domestic publics [and **weakening**
their critical role within the movement]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
At the structural-political level, [the focus]{.underline} on trauma
narration [came at the expense of **political praxis** and were
congruent with a **general avoidance** of political
participation]{.underline} in the organisations that emerged from the
movement.

Drawing on [the notion of the **embedded intellectual**]{.underline}
(Baert & Shipman, 2013), we have described how [an **extreme** version
of this positionality has resulted in a focus on trauma
work]{.underline}, [advocacy]{.underline}, [and mourning at the
**expense** of interventions with revolutionary ideas or visionary
political analyses]{.underline}. Indeed, intellectual positioning can
fundamentally be impacted by the process of cultural trauma construction
where the intellectual's identity is primarily shaped by shared
suffering and by identification with victims. [[Such identification
**steers intellectuals away**]{.mark} from previously
understood]{.underline} critical or educational [interventions [and
**distracts** them]{.mark} from the critical roles of political thought
[and]{.mark} political organising]{.underline}. By
**[over-emphasising]{.underline}** their [embeddedness within the masses
and denying distinctions]{.underline} between the two, advocacy and
trauma work [tend to **obscure** any leadership or critical
responsibilities that intellectuals were once thought to
bear]{.underline}.

In the case of Syria, [weakened discursive influence [manifested in
interventions which were]{.mark} **politically
[hollow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[critically
[hesitant]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**intellectually [stale]{.mark}**
[or]{.mark} **socially [appeasing]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[[these]{.mark} interventions **[failed to guide]{.mark} the
movement**]{.underline}, [**[inspire]{.mark} publics** [or
**propose**]{.mark} **post-revolutionary [alternatives]{.mark}** [when
the need]{.mark} for them [was **most
critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Abstinence from institutional
politics was reflected in the weak representation of intellectuals in
the political organisations that emerged from the movement. Despite
insistence on the importance of ending Syria's 'politicide' and enabling
the resurrection of free political life in Syria,
[[intellectuals]{.mark} **explicitly problematised** and [**refrained**
from participation in]{.mark} the movement's [**institutions**
or]{.mark} what they critically referred to as]{.underline}
'[**[professional politics]{.underline}**']{.mark}. It is difficult to
work out whether such avoidance was caused primarily by the focus on
trauma narration and overidentification with 'the people' or whether it
resulted from it. What is clear, however, is that both are congruent and
entangled with each other. For example, we have argued that refusing to
perform a leadership role was influenced by a perception of an
anti-leadership ethos amongst their movement publics. [The position of
**uncritical solidarity from below** and its resulting interventions
were]{.underline} best [**aligned** with this critical
stance]{.underline} towards the idea of leadership and therefore
denunciation of leadership can be seen as both a cause and a symptom of
the embedded positionality.

It is paradoxical that [the embedded position is premised on the idea of
**interdependency** between theory and praxis whereby the intellectual
is in **close dialogue** with the community]{.underline}, [**learning**
from the public and **teaching** them all at once]{.underline}. And yet,
[in its **extreme** form]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} embeddedness
[resulted in]{.underline} interventions that not only performed a
position of equality and reciprocity with 'the people' but expressed a
certain sense of awe, guilt, and inferiority towards them and towards
their suffering. In this way the work of advocacy, trauma narration and
mourning took centre stage becoming [a **hindrance** to political
programming and praxis]{.underline}. [Not only did intellectuals
**abandon** organisational responsibilities but they became **advocates
of public sentiment**]{.underline}, [offering **[uncritical
solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} towards what they perceived to be the
people's will. [Paired with a politically turbulent context in **grave
need** of clear]{.underline}, [timely]{.underline}, [critical and
performatively potent intellectual interventions]{.underline}, radical
embeddedness may have been a hindrance to the movement in that [it
[**politically neutralised** an important discursive
current]{.mark}]{.underline} - the secular democratic current - [**all
too soon** [and left the opposition]{.mark} **even more
[susceptible]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} competing discursive currents
supported by]{.underline} geopolitically motivated **[[external
agendas]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### AT: Presumption Bad

#### Presumption K is [wrong]{.underline}:

#### [NOT IDEOLOGICAL]{.underline}. It [minimizes]{.underline} intervention, ensures [reliable]{.underline} and [predictable]{.underline} decisionmaking, and prevents judge [biases]{.underline} from entering the debate. It's not a double-standard because it applies to the neg too!

**Hiland, 24**---Senior Lecturer in Communication & Media at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute (Alexander, "Judging Policy Debate," *A Short
Guide to Policy Debate*, Chapter 8, pp. 136, dml)

The third principle is [the burden of **presumption**]{.underline}.
[[Assuming]{.underline}]{.mark} all other things equal, and [[the debate
is otherwise **irresolvable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which side should
**win**]{.mark} the debate[?]{.mark}]{.underline} The conventional
wisdom among such coaches would tend to conclude as follows.
[[Presumption rests with the]{.mark} **[neg]{.mark}ative** [except where
the]{.mark} [neg]{.mark}ative [has]{.mark} proposed [an]{.mark}
**alternative [advocacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The reasoning for this
is that [[to justify **voting** for the]{.mark} [aff]{.mark}irmative
[they must **satisfy the demand**]{.mark} to present a case]{.underline}
that satisfies the stock issues of the debate, but in the instance where
the negative argues a counterplan rather than defending the status quo
the burden of the negative shifts toward proving the counterplan is
competitive and of greater advantage. This principle is important
because [there are [many debates]{.mark} that **[do not resolve
themselves clearly]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and [so the judge must
**render a decision**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much the same way as the
principle of innocent until proven guilty compels a prosecutor to prove
their case, [[presumption burdens the]{.mark}
**[aff]{.mark}irmative**]{.underline} (**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
perhaps subsequently [the **[neg]{.mark}ative**]{.underline}) [[to
**prove** their case]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **obviates** the judge
from]{.mark} rendering [a decision that **reflects their own
beliefs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [[the debate is
determined by the **failings** of **one side** or the **other**]{.mark}
of the debate]{.underline}.

These general principles particular to the decision-making process are
help- ful guides, but [there are]{.underline} some additional [qualities
that a judge should attempt to embody [in **deciding the
winner**]{.mark} of a debate]{.underline}. [Beyond pursuing
**objectivity** and avoiding **intervention**]{.underline}, [[a judge
should work to be **predictable**]{.mark} in]{.underline} terms of
[their decision-making process]{.underline}. When a judge attends a
tournament they are obliged to make a written statement of their
decision-making process, called a paradigm, available to the debaters.
In rendering [[their decision]{.underline}]{.mark}, a judge
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} make a good effort to adhere to this
paradigm so that the decisions made by the debaters [[reflect to the
**greatest extent possible** quality argumentation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Key to [METHODOLOGICAL SYMMETRY]{.underline}. Prerequisite to effective struggle. No double-standard.

In developing this constructive angle, [I [employ]{.mark}]{.underline} a
strategy of what I want to call **[[methodological
symmetry]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [[attempts]{.mark} to mitigate
epistemic injustice [are put under the **same justificatory pressure as
any other**]{.mark} **political [action]{.mark}** in having [to **prove
their usefulness** rather than]{.mark} getting [preferential treatment
as]{.mark}]{.underline} ['**[ends]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**[in
themselves]{.underline}**']{.mark}. [In order [to be]{.mark} considered
[a **worthwhile goal** in the context of **wider struggles**]{.mark} for
social justice]{.underline}, [mitigating epistemic injustice [needs to
**contribute**]{.mark} to these struggles]{.underline}. [In order [to be
**prioritized** for political action]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[mitigating epistemic injustice [needs to be **at least as effective**
as **other** courses]{.mark} of action that could be prioritized
**instead**]{.underline}. Note that I consider this to be a
methodological strategy rather than a claim about the nature of
epistemic injustice. [I [do not]{.mark} want to **[deny]{.mark}** that
epistemic justice can be of [intrinsic value]{.mark} or an end in
itself]{.underline}. Instead, I want to argue that [the concerns of
[distorting agendas and epistemic]{.mark} resource [exploitation are
**most effectively addressed** when showing]{.mark} that epistemic
justice is of **[extrinsic value]{.mark}** for wider]{.underline} social
justice [agendas [**independently** of]{.mark} claims of
[intrinsic]{.mark} value]{.underline}. [Methodological
symmetry]{.underline} therefore largely [boils down to a]{.underline}
rather **[straightforward heuristic]{.underline}**: [we should **[avoid
messy trade-offs]{.mark}** between]{.underline} the **[intrinsic
value]{.underline}** of epistemic justice [and **adverse extrinsic
effects** [by showing that]{.mark}]{.underline} epistemic justice
[[agendas are **also** extrinsically justified]{.underline}]{.mark}.

the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Ryan, "The Future Isn't
Now: Impossible Action in Political Scholarship," Aporias, Issue 13.1
(Spring 2024), dml)

If we wish to engage in an authentically constructive politics, doing so
will require discipline.34 [[We must]{.mark} not just **imagine**
otherwise but **do** otherwise]{.underline}---[[discern how to
**enact**]{.mark} the [possibilities]{.mark} toward which we
gesture]{.underline}, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand,
[[attend to their **impossibility**]{.underline}]{.mark} amidst this
suffering world. This is why, as Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò has argued,
constructivist politics is not just invigorating but "demanding":

It [asks us to be]{.underline} planners and designers, to be
[**accountable** and **responsive** to people who aren't yet in the
room]{.underline}. In addition to being architects, it asks us to become
builders and construction workers: [[to **actually build**]{.mark} the
kinds of [rooms]{.mark} we could sit in [together]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[rather than]{.underline} ]{.mark}[**idly [speculate]{.mark}** about
which rooms would be nice]{.underline}. But . . . the constructive
approach has implicit moral and emotional demands, as well: we can
neither plan nor build a better world without collectively cultivating
diverse kinds of moral and emotional discipline.35

[We must dream]{.underline}, [and envision]{.underline}, [and
imagine]{.underline}, and bring our emotional powers to bear on
presaging [a new world]{.underline}. [And then we must **actually do
it**]{.underline}. [[We must cultivate]{.mark} affective [attachments
that do not indulge in **empty dreams** of possibility or use theory as
an **alibi for complacency**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
does not mean we should atomize all political activity---to be sure, we
must develop social habits that emphasize genuine political commitments
over social capital, create professional structures that help make it
easy to translate our work to activism, and so much more. But none of
those collective efforts can succeed without individual discipline. This
might strike the reader as monastic or militaristic, but discipline is
not the sole domain of monks or soldiers. Discipline is the precondition
for a radical ethic; discipline [entails recognizing that [it's **hard**
to do the right thing]{.mark} in an unjust world]{.underline}---[that
[forgoing easy consolation in favor of concrete action must be **at
least a little taxing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Discipline means
self-knowledge and self-control. [[It requires us to **recognize the
difference** between gesture and reality]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to avoid
the trap of **self-indulgence**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, above
all, [to **do** what we **say** we're going to do]{.underline}.

If we insist on making scholarship a venue for activism, then we must do
so with the genuine rigor of any other activist venture. [This means
**knowing the difference** between the **drunkenness of hope** and the
**discipline of action**]{.underline}. [It means not just cheering
ourselves up or helping ourselves believe that our local action would
mean something if only we got around to it]{.underline}. No: [it means
[being **honest** in committing to
action]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes, it
means [being honest [about when action is
**impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Re-conceptualizing Arctic Territory at the International Level

[At the international level]{.underline} [[the ICC]{.underline}]{.mark}
is also challenging the nation-state-centered approach to international
relations and [[presenting the Arctic]{.mark} [as a distinct
region]{.mark} in an effort to strengthen Inuit sovereignty
claims]{.underline} and to enhance the Inuit voice in Arctic affairs.
This occurred most recently with the drafting of two ICC declarations
that, it could be argued, serve as foreign policy statements. At one
time it was meaningless to speak of a non-nation-state having a foreign
policy, [but the scenario evolving in the Arctic is giving significant
meaning to this development. While each Arctic nation state has issued
its own Arctic foreign policy, as mentioned above, both the ICC and
Saami Council, have released international declarations.]{.underline} To
date, the [[sub-field]{.mark} [of foreign policy
analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has not included indigenous
policies]{.mark} and declarations [as part of the foreign policy
dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[And yet, this is]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[precisely what is [occurring in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [potential influence of
non-nation-state bodies]{.underline}, peoples and organizations that
prioritize the rights of a people [in the foreign policy dialogue could
have a profound impact on the way we understand the world]{.underline}.

In April 2009 the ICC launched the A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on
Sovereignty in the Arctic. The declaration was written to address
increased outside interest in the Arctic as a result of climate change
and the race for Arctic resources. Griffith (2011) argues that A
Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Sovereignty in the Arctic is a
manifesto as well as "an outline of a possible legal case against the
Arctic states" (Griffith, 2011: 131). He notes, ["the Inuit believe that
they have a legal right to participate in Arctic governance that
coexists]{.underline} [with and cannot be trumped by]{.underline} [state
sovereignty]{.underline}" (Griffith, 2011: 136). Perhaps the most
impressive challenge to nation-state sovereignty occurs in Article 2.1
of the declaration:

"Sovereignty" is a term that has often been used to refer to the
absolute and independent authority of a community or nation both
internally and externally. Sovereignty is a contested concept, however,
and does not have a fixed meaning. [[Old ideas of sovereignty]{.mark}
[are breaking]{.mark} [down as different governance models]{.mark}, such
as the European Union, [evolve.]{.mark} [Sovereignties overlap]{.mark}
[and are]{.mark} frequently [divided within federations]{.mark} in
creative ways [to recognize the right of peoples]{.mark}. For Inuit
living within the states of Russia, Canada, the USA and
Denmark/Greenland, issues of sovereignty and sovereign rights must be
examined and assessed in the context of our long history of struggle to
gain recognition and respect as an Arctic indigenous people having the
right to exercise self-determination over our lives, territories,
cultures and languages.]{.underline}

By referencing the European Union the ICC cleverly bases its claims to
sovereignty on concepts that have been accepted in the international
community, extending these innovative notions of sovereignty to Inuit
claims. Indeed, a journalist for thestar.com (the digital desk for the
Toronto Star), introduced the release of A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration
on Sovereignty in the Arctic by describing the Inuit as "a new party ...
shouldering its way into international sovereignty discussions" (Weber,
28 April 2009: para. 1). Mary Simon (2011) argues that A [[Circumpolar
Inuit Declaration on Sovereignty]{.mark} [in the Arctic defines
sovereignty as **not incompatible with nation-state membership**]{.mark}
and that the Inuit have and will continue to take legal action if
necessary to ensure their involvement in development in the
Arctic]{.underline}. In 2011, the ICC released its second declaration, A
Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Resource Development Principles in
Inuit Nunaat to respond to the growing interest in resource development
in the Arctic by nation-states and transnational corporations. The
release of A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Resource Development
Principles in Inuit Nunaat was to coincide with the Ministerial Meeting
of the Arctic Council in Nuuk, Greenland in April 2011. The declarations
draws on the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples arguing that Inuit rights are protected under domestic and
international law. While there is considerable debate within ICC
regarding natural resource development, the Inuit want the right to
decide on the future of the region as "a people." The [two declarations
are effectively challenging traditional nation-state-centered concepts
of territory and sovereignty and furthering Inuit rights to land and
resource use.]{.underline}

The Role of Customary Law in Inuit Political Engagement

In addition to challenging conventional concepts of territory at the
domestic and international levels, the [Inuit are [increasingly
using]{.mark} [i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
ensure their rights and voice on the international
stage]{.mark}.]{.underline} [There is a growing body of literature from
legal experts (Christie, 2011; Graham & Wiessner, 2011; Griffith, 2011;
Koivurova, 2010) anticipating the impact of the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) on enhanced
indigenous involvement internationally. Koivurova (2010) and Griffith
(2011) address legal notions of territory and the potential use of
international law to further the rights of Arctic indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. [Koivurova examines how indigenous peoples have
been successful in utilizing international law to their advantage. He
acknowledges that while the primary subject of international law
continues to be the nation-state, "it is [interesting to study how much
space peoples]{.mark} (which are not states) [have been able to carve
out for themselves]{.mark} in international law"]{.underline}
(Koivurova, 2010: 192). Koivurova notes that [**since WWII
[international law has focused increasingly on peoples rather than
states]{.mark}** and that this may have some bearing and even legal
ramifications for how self-determination is understood]{.underline}. [In
particular, Part 1, Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, 1976, states, "all peoples have the right of
self-determination." Koivurova calls this "pretty explosive stuff"
(Koivurova, 2010: 192) as this implies there is a legally binding
obligation to honor the self-determination of peoples. Griffith (2011)
examines how international law [could become]{.mark} [a]{.mark} more
[effective tool for the Inuit]{.mark}, in particular. The challenge,
according to Griffith, is that international law was initially used
against indigenous peoples and, that the principal subject of
international law has always been the state.]{.underline} Therefore,
only states can bring cases to the International Court of Justice or
"benefit from the prohibition on the use of force and other forms of
trans-boundary intervention" (Griffith, 2011: 132). [However,
[using]{.mark} the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ([UDHR]{.mark})
as an example, [Griffith describes]{.mark} how [what was once a set
of]{.mark} guiding [principles has become customary law]{.mark}. Today,
Griffith explains, the majority of [states act in accordance]{.mark}
[with the UDHR]{.mark} and do so out of a sense of legal
obligation]{.underline} (Griffith, 2011: 139). [Increasingly UNDRIP is
being referred to in declarations and by commissions and has every
possibility of similarly becoming customary law in the future. [Once the
UNDRIP]{.mark} [has achieved]{.mark} the [status of customary
law]{.mark} then the Inuit [can argue that]{.mark} "[not having a role
in Arctic governance will threaten their internationally recognized
rights as a people"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Griffith, 2011: 142).
According to Griffith, this would then provide the Inuit with "a solid
claim to the rights they seek" (Griffith, 2011: 142). Christie (2011)
insists that it is only via the UNDRIP that the Inuit will be able to
successfully challenge nation-state dominance in the Arctic. Christie is
not convinced that the Arctic Council equates to the new paradigm in
international relations. When the Inuit, or other indigenous groups,
participate in the Arctic Council proceedings, decision-making is still
bound by the limitations of "intergovernmental relations" (Christie
2011, 336). However, [if the rights of indigenous peoples are
increasingly recognized in international law, then these dynamics may
shift. According to Christie, [indigenous rights as "a people," affirmed
by the UNDRIP]{.mark}, [is **challenging the** **"'absolute' nature of
territorial sovereignty**"]{.mark} and fostering the "growth of
international institutions]{.underline}" (Christie, 2011: 336). The
primary issue here is one of territory or the framing of the political
map as well as the effective integration of the UNDRIP in future legal
decision making in the Arctic.

International law, like international relations, has traditionally
utilized the nation-state as its primary unit of analysis. However, as
the UNDRIP evolves from a guiding principle to international customary
law, it has the potential to safeguard indigenous rights globally and to
provide the Inuit, in particular, with an effective tool in assuring
their voice and rights in the dialogue on the future of the Arctic. The
ICC strategically included mention of their rights as "a people" under
the UNDRIP in both A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Sovereignty in the
Arctic (2009) and A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on Resource
Development Principles in Inuit Nunaat (2011).

Conclusion

The Arctic is going through a dramatic change as a result of global
warming. [Increased access to natural resources and new shipping routes
are focusing international attention on the region.]{.underline} The
implications of this change are unpredictable particularly concerning
geopolitics. A number of non-Arctic states and organizations are
pursuing Observer Status on the Arctic Council, including China, Japan,
Italy, South Korea and the EU. There is no question, according to a
recent front-page article in The New York Times, that "[the world's
superpowers are increasingly jockeying for political influence and
economic position]{.underline}" (Rosenthal, 2012: A1) in the region.
While significant research is being conducted on how international law
might resolve competing interests in the Arctic, much less attention is
given to how Arctic indigenous peoples are reframing the political map
to develop a method of governance better suited to the unique challenges
of the circumpolar world. What distinguishes international relations in
the Arctic today from the Cold War, is that there are new actors on the
world stage who are exercising a relatively influential role in how
future global interests in the region will play out[. [Arctic indigenous
peoples]{.mark} [are forming effective transnational political
organizations]{.mark} (Permanent Participant organizations),
[challenging conventional concepts of territory, drafting international
declarations, and securing their rights as a people via]{.mark}
international [customary]{.mark} [law]{.mark}.]{.underline} [These
efforts are effectively enhancing the Arctic indigenous voice and
influence in domestic and international affairs and transforming the
global dialogue concerning the Arctic region.]{.underline} According to
Wilson & Smith (2011), [the [Inuit voice has "challenged the
state-centric status quo and dominant economic ideologies that shape the
current world order]{.mark}"]{.underline} (910). [What is [occurring in
the Arctic is an unparalleled level of indigenous political
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arguably, for the first time in
history, [**[indigenous peoples and nation-states are working
together]{.underline}** [to resolve]{.underline} [some of the most
significant environmental, social and geopolitical challenges of our
time]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The Inuit are "remapping" the Arctic region
and shaping domestic and international policy with implications for the
circumpolar world]{.underline} [and beyond.]{.underline}

### Conspicuous Sustainability---1NC

#### Symbolic politics risks falling into the trap of "conspicuous sustainability", which turns case by taking attention away from material issues in favor of empty tokens. Their portrayal of vulnerability in order to justify symbolic politics only reifies colonial power.

**[[Conspicuous sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, referring to
[[engagement]{.mark} in **[symbolic]{.mark} sustainability
[initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} whether or not they contribute to
sustainability processes, has become a [[popular]{.mark} development
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} for small islands worldwide. Drawing on
island examples from around the world, we argue that [conspicuous
sustainability is [**counterproductive** to efforts]{.mark} at
[global]{.mark} **[sustainability]{.mark}** and risks subjecting islands
to unrealistically high environmental standards, at the expense of more
pressing needs.]{.underline}

[Islands invite symbolism]{.underline}: they are uniquely \'subject to
dream and nightmare\' (Gillis 2007, 274) and [attractive as \'detached,
self-contained entities\' with clear boundaries]{.underline} (King 1993,
14). This boundedness contributes to islands\' conceptualisation and
iconicity, [to their compelling \'lure\' (Baldacchino 2012a) as places
of calm, refuge and splendid isolation.]{.underline} Although many
islanders resist having their (often troubled) communities labelled as
paradises, many other islanders internalise the stereotype (Baldacchino
2008). The dream of the island paradise is accompanied by the nightmare
of alleged island vulnerability (Philpot et al. 2015). As Baldacchino
states: [Islanders are often portrayed in the metropolitan press as
victims of tragic circumstances beyond their control, fitting easily
into stereotypes of dehistoricized vulnerability and \'paradise in
peril. (2008, 46)]{.underline}

Challenges include economic disadvantages, corruption and bad
governance, military or tourist invasion, and exploitation by large
corporations. Islands, like many other locations, experience these
risks, but just as [the [boundedness of small islands]{.mark} makes
their [beauty more graspable]{.mark}]{.underline}, it also sets their

Conspicuous sustainability

This paper focuses on initiatives undertaken in the name of
sustainability and climate change mitigation that also seek to gain
competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism,
claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance, or obviate the
need for more comprehensive policy action. [When a **community** or
organisation **undertakes** an **initiative** that **gains** much of its
**value** **from** its **visibility, iconicity and
symbolism**]{.underline} (rather than from the environmental benefits it
produces), [we term this **behaviour** **\'conspicuous
sustainability\'**]{.underline}. Instances of conspicuous sustainability
often genuinely enhance sustainability or self-sufficiency in small but
direct ways while nevertheless harming the cause of sustainable
development and climate change mitigation more generally.

[It is **not** that islanders **seek to deceive** **people** or **damage
the environment**;]{.underline} rather, the [power of **island
symbolism** is such that both islanders and mainlanders **tend to
mentally enlarge** the **impact** of island sustainability
**initiatives** **beyond**]{.underline} their actual
**[contributions]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [islanders may
imagine]{.underline} that what they see as [side-benefits to promoting
sustainability]{.underline} (positive place brand, advantages in
attracting tourists, enhanced diplomatic power) [represent value added,
when in fact these side-benefits can transform over time into the
primary rationale for such initiative]{.underline}s. Innocuous
initiatives (renewable energy systems, recycling, ecological footprint
reduction) can be made conspicuous through explicit branding exercises.

Some sustainability initiatives are conspicuous from conception, for
instance projects involving high visibility (foregrounding
sustainability infrastructure) andimpressive \'green-looking\'
architecture.

The linking of sustainability initiatives with sustainable tourism or
ecotourism is frequently indicative of conspicuous sustainability.
Tourism is an important industry for many islands (Baldacchino and
Ferreira 2013), and ecotourists are regarded as particularly valuable
island visitors (d\'Hauteserre and Funck 2016). Sustainable tourism and
ecotourism are themselves contested due to their own contribution to
climate change (Maguigad et al. 2015), with assessments of tourism
sustainability typically requiring the externalisation of greenhouse gas
emissions resulting from transport while trying to reconcile the often
excessive on-island resource use by tourists. When Chongming Island,
China was aiming to develop itself as an eco-island, ecotourism and
eco-agriculture (for both climate change mitigation and adaptation) were
seen as the main pathways to success, with recognition that tourism
itself might preclude it from becoming an eco-island (Huang et al.
2008).

### Imaginative Politics Fail---1NC

#### Imagining new worlds as a political strategy [fails]{.underline} and generates [cruel optimism]{.underline}.

**Carroll, 24**---PhD student in English and Comparative Literature at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Ryan, "The Future Isn't
Now: Impossible Action in Political Scholarship," Aporias, Issue 13.1
(Spring 2024), dml)

In a dark world, [it's **exhilarating** to dream of
possibility]{.underline}. [A certain vein of]{.underline} literary and
cultural [[critique]{.mark} is [founded]{.mark} [on]{.mark} this
principle]{.underline}, proposing [that there is something politically
productive in **[imagining]{.mark} otherwise**]{.underline}. Such
scholarship, which stretches across a variety of different
methodological positions, is readily recognized by its gestural
rhetoric---[its stakes are to inaugurate **new paradigms**]{.underline},
[shed light on potential **[ways of being]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[envision **[other worlds]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In one way, this ethos
makes sense: radical politics should point the way to something better
than death and destruction. But it seems that [the thrill of
possibility-creation]{.underline} has produced a new aporia for
critique. The affect that undergirds possibility politics---the ecstasy
of imagining otherwise---[[runs the risk of **obscuring**]{.mark} **the
[obstacles]{.mark}** between critique and action and thereby [making
critique more **indulgent** than **generative**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[more **projective** than **powerful**]{.underline}, [more
**self-soothing** than **edifying**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The politics of possibility descends from a critical-theoretical turn
toward speculative thinking in the past two decades. José Esteban
Muñoz's Cruising Utopia (2009), a seminal text [in **queer
studies**]{.underline}, is perhaps the most salient example of such
thought: Muñoz posits on the first page that [queerness is emblematic
of]{.underline} "an insistence on potentiality or concrete [possibility
for another world]{.underline}."1 For him, queerness is a "warm
illumination of [a **horizon** imbued with
**potentiality**]{.underline}" and studying queer aesthetics unveils
"blueprints and schemata of a forward-dawning futurity" for human
sociality.2 But Cruising Utopia is not alone in its speculative
disposition. [A similar maneuver appears]{.underline}, albeit with
different disciplinary coordinates, [in]{.underline} Saidiya Hartman's
"Venus in Two Acts," which positions [**Hartman's** method of **critical
fabulation**]{.underline} as a means for "exploiting the capacities of
the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that expresses doubts, wishes, and
possibilities)" to tell provisional histories of transatlantic slavery.3
Though slavery's archive is inevitably fragmented, possibility lingers
in the act of critical intervention: aporia births vitality, if only
temporarily. Hartman's later Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments (2019)
offers a less qualified version of this historical-poetical method:
excavating "the nothing special and the extraordinary brutality" of
fin-de-siècle Black life, she says, produces a "chorus" which "propels
transformation . . . is an incubator of possibility, an assembly
sustaining dreams of otherwise."4 While Hartman does not avow precisely
the same utopianist commitment as Muñoz, possibility is still a galvanic
force of her work; [critique's work seems to be its
**possibility-making**]{.underline}.

Nor are appeals to possibility confined to what we loosely (and/or
arbitrarily) call critique. Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's "Paranoid Reading,
Reparative Reading," for instance, posits the titular reparative method
not as an aesthetic practice for the well-lettered but as a way to
"assemble and confer plenitude on an object that will then have the
resources to offer an inchoate self."5 What we "learn" from such
objects, she argues, is the "many ways selves and communities succeed in
extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture."6 Tucked into
Sedgwick's language is an appeal to criticism's possibility-making
faculty: her reparative politics is about discerning what makes it
possible for an individual or collective to survive in a hostile world.
Even Rita Felski's The Limits of Critique, the most stridently
anti-critique entry in literary studies' so-called Method Wars, nestles
an appeal to possibility within its political pragmatism. Though Felski
dismisses critique's supposed utopianism, she asserts that her aim is to
find a method, and thus a politics, open to "the differences,
variations, contradictions, and possibilities in social conditions as we
find them."7 The problem, for Felski, is about how literary methodology
conditions our ability to judge which resources for possible worlds are
contained in which political environments---not so different from Muñoz
or Hartman, in an odd sense.

I make this critical tour to highlight that possibility politics is not
a narrow strain of thought. On the contrary, as Caroline Levine argues,
critical attention to potentiality stretches across theoretical schools
and methodologies (Levine herself cites Derek Attridge, Jonathan
Kramnick, and Roderick Ferguson as noteworthy examples,8 though we might
also think of Ernst Bloch,9 Theodor Adorno,10 Herbert Marcuse,11 or, for
that matter, the lengthy Hegelian philosophical tradition from which
they emerged---all of which is incredibly productive to consider but
which there isn't space here to discuss).12 [This sort of scholarship
asserts that **cultural materials**]{.underline}, [whether in
**themselves** or upon being activated by **scholarly
engagement**]{.underline}, [contain some way of **coordinating
possibilities** and **envisioning new worlds**]{.underline}. By
extension, [critical theory's competency is to make these possibilities
**explicit**]{.underline}. In the ecosystem of revolutionary vocations,
the scholar is imagined as a medley of prophet and strategist, herald of
the possible and presager of action.

But [the critique]{.underline} that's followed Sedgwick, Hartman, and
Muñoz, I think, [has become **yoked** to an affect that **risks
entrapment** in the promise of possibility]{.underline}. Although it's
easy to indulge in rapturous accounts of scholarship's worldmaking
power, it's also easy to forget that [[there's **no necessary
connection** between]{.mark} a hopeful [affect and]{.mark} an
[ability]{.mark} to enact possibilities]{.underline}. As Patricia
Stuelke has remarked, "[[To imagine that things are **broken** and can
be **fixed** with]{.underline}]{.mark} the best of intentions, with a
labor of love, with [a **new way of [reading]{.mark}**]{.underline} . .
. [[is a **category error**]{.mark} that neither the **planet** nor any
of its **inhabitants** can afford]{.underline}."13 [Although we can
revel in imagining the construction of a better world, there's **no
guarantee** our blueprints reach the
builder]{.underline}---[and]{.underline}, even worse, [the **binge of
hope** can lead back into **despair**]{.underline}.

To be clear, I am not taking issue with the speculative scholars I've
considered so far---their work is illuminating, and in fact, it's
precisely my belief that we haven't read them well enough. Instead, [our
readings have led to a kind of ersatz utopianism that can **occlude**
the real demands of activist commitment]{.underline}. [Although [a
**variety of material factors** stand in the way of
scholar-activism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [from institutional complicity to
prohibitive constraints on time]{.underline},14 [the affect of
possibility [scholarship risks **painting over** these
difficulties]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The stakes are high]{.underline}:
[if we do not recognize the feelings that structure our scholarly
political commitments]{.underline}, [scholarly activism will be
**nothing more than a language game**]{.underline}.

It begins when I (you, we) inhabit the world. [The world feels
terrible]{.underline}. For reasons related to content oversaturation, to
my own uncertainty in what I do, to my own struggle to commit to doing
the work of making the world better, and to the multiple cultural
phenomena grouped under the rubric of "crisis," things feel bad.

[Then]{.underline}, [I open a book]{.underline}. A special book. I read
a pithy, punchy, compelling voice: English departments and/or the
humanities and/or higher education and/or liberal democracy and/or
global ecology is/are in a state of crisis, the kind of crisis that
seems as crushing to read about as it is to experience (a vulgar
abstraction, but a common one for many in the academy). Then, somewhere
in the book, perhaps in its introduction or methodological outline,
maybe in the theoretical intervention or maybe in the rhetorical
flourish that hints at its final chapter, there's something else.
Literary studies itself, I learn, represents hope. [I
realize]{.underline}, carried along by the beaming light of incandescent
language, [that reading can sculpt the flames of
possibility]{.underline}. [Suddenly]{.underline}, [it seems
**thrillingly simple** to touch another world]{.underline}. [I learn
that I can **build with literature**]{.underline}, [that the past
contains tools to reconstruct the future]{.underline}, [that I belong to
a class of heroes prophesying visions to construct a new
world]{.underline}. [I just need do what I'm **already good at
doing**]{.underline}: [write about books]{.underline}.

I tell my colleagues about the text, mention it in conference panels,
drop references in essays, content myself with knowing that I am on the
frontlines of something new. [Possibilities **seize** me]{.underline}:
[perhaps I will use]{.underline} Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White
(1860) for [**mutual aid communications** or]{.underline} Virginia
Woolf's Between the Acts (1941) to [organize a **community collective**
or]{.underline} Morowa Yejidé's Creatures of Passage (2021) for
[creating **collective historical records**]{.underline}.

[But I **don't**]{.underline}.

I might fire off an email or donate money to a bail fund or germinate an
idea for a discussion group, but eventually, [the ecstasy **fades** into
the murmur of everyday life]{.underline}. I return to research and
teaching, and the grand possibilities I excavated from my literature of
choice fade away. I tell myself it's okay (the real work I do is the
care work of teaching, anyway). I open my phone. I'm slapped in the face
with content overload, crisis porn. Things feel bad. It begins again.

In part, this is a story about one person (me) with their own foibles
(mine). Simultaneously, however, this is also not about just one person.
This is about the kinds of feelings that thread across our intellectual
engagement, the affects that shape how we read and speak and think about
acting. My intent here is not to engage in what David Kurnick has
thoughtfully called a "moralized characterology," a rhetorical maneuver
implying that the crisis in the humanities has something to do with
particular kinds of psyches.15 To be clear: whether or not the
humanities wither under institutional austerity will have little to do
with the affect of our possibility politics. Yet though our psyches
won't determine critique's institutional fate, [whether and how we're
able to put our gestures into action has **entirely** to do with our
**affective disposition**]{.underline}, [with our ability to **convert
everyday feelings into political commitments**]{.underline}.

And so this is not just a story about me. I suspect that you, too, have
read a work that's made you hope, that's given you the thrill of
possibility, and that has dropped you back into hopelessness. I suspect
that you've read a paper or heard a conference presentation that
contends with unspeakable violence---white supremacy, homophobia,
imperialism---and, [blithely invoking possibility
scholarship]{.underline} (often that of Muñoz or Hartman), [**paves
over** the difference between gesture and action]{.underline}.

[[This]{.mark} mode of scholarship]{.underline}, I contend,
[[risks]{.mark} producing]{.underline} the kind of the affect that
Lauren Berlant terms **[[cruel optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**: "When
something you desire is actually an obstacle to your flourishing."16 For
Berlant, this kind of relation is constituted by "attachments that
organize the present," rather than ones that responsibly relate to the
future.17 The connection might seem odd, given that possibility politics
professes to be about futurity---but [[despite]{.mark} its notional
[commitment to the **future**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the affect]{.mark}
of possibility politics [is]{.mark} **inevitably** [bound up with how
one feels **now**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Inevitably, any critical
maneuver will draw from and produce specific affects in those who make
and read them; in the case of possibility politics, [it isn't just about
the future we imagine but our disposition to the
**present**]{.underline}, [the way that [dreams of possible worlds can
**soothe**]{.mark} **the [psychic pain]{.mark}** of contemporary
political violence]{.underline}. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and
this part is crucial---[despite its power to energize]{.underline} the
writer and reader, [to soothe the psychic pain of living in an ailing
world]{.underline}, [scholarly possibilities [have **no necessary
relation** to future]{.mark}-oriented **[action]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Gestures toward possibility **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, [[**fix** the fact that]{.underline}]{.mark}, as sociologist
Francesca Cancian has highlighted, [[to be a]{.mark} professional
[academic and]{.mark} committed [activist are each **so demanding** as
to **preclude one another**]{.mark}]{.underline}.18

Now, we might tell ourselves, it's hardly fair to think of theory in the
same way we think about concrete action like community agriculture,
wealth redistribution, or eviction disruption. [Theory]{.underline}, we
know so well and are so happy to explain, [belongs in a dialectic with
action]{.underline}; theory's purpose is to offer provocations rather
than engage in concrete solution-making, and it demands
non-instrumentalized thinking to do so.19 But we shouldn't forget
[that]{.underline} dialectic [demands moving between theory and
action]{.underline}, [not simply **flinging possibilities into a void**
and **hoping something will happen**]{.underline}. As Nicholas Whittaker
has incisively argued of "undercommons" scholarship: "it might seem as
though all the undercommons has to offer us are declarations: screeds
and manifestos and reading groups and open-access journals. If David's
stone cannot fell Goliath, what good are his words?"20 Ultimately, [if
critique only produces hypothetical possibility and inebriated
hope]{.underline}, then [it isn't **praxis**]{.underline}---[it's
**escapism**]{.underline}.

Earlier in this essay, I quoted the first page of Cruising Utopia, in
which Muñoz asserts that queerness represents "an insistence on
potentiality or concrete possibility for another world." But, like many
who bandy about Muñoz's words, I did not quote the book's very first
line: "Queerness is not yet here."21

The line is startling. Compared to the gossamer language of
possibility-making, it seems cold and blunt. He continues: "The here and
now is a prison house . . . Queerness is that thing that lets us feel
that the world is not enough, that indeed something is missing."22
There's a sober recognition that the root of utopian possibility is
existential negation. Agony underpins the moment of queer worldmaking;
the glimmering light of another world is only visible amidst a morass of
death. Though utopianism helps one survive, it's not an opiate---it's a
response to the absurd pain of living in a world that doesn't want you.
In part, this complexity can be traced to Cruising Utopia's historicity.
As Muñoz himself clarifies, his argument is an intervention on queer
theory's 90s-to-2000s tug-of-war between antisociality and neoliberal
concessionism, between Lee Edelman's "fuck the social order . . . fuck
Annie; fuck the waif from Les Mis," et al.23 and we're just like you.24
His affective posture belongs to a complex discursive field that is
defined as much by the political prospects of 2009 as by Cruising
Utopia's internal logic; there's a way, in other words, that Muñoz's
thought meant something different then than it does now.

The same is true of Hartman: despite the lackadaisical ease with which
many scholars invoke her, her critical possibility-making emerges not in
glib rhetorical flourish but in a specific historical-critical venture.
In her careful sketch of critical fabulation in "Venus in Two Acts,"
Hartman recognizes that to do so is to "tell an impossible story and to
amplify the impossibility of its telling"25---and indeed, she does so
specifically as a counterpoint to her own critical fabulation in Lose
Your Mother (2007).26 Possibility folds back into impossibility; hope
for the possible is born only out of the impossible, irredeemable,
absolute unlivability of slavery and its afterlives. Such is evident in
her first book, Scenes of Subjection, which concerns itself with action
and possibility---not offering a roadmap for the reader, but attempting
to account for slave subjects themselves. Although the book devotes
considerable attention to action itself, Hartman emphasizes that the
"utopian expressions of freedom" to be found in the archive of American
slavery "are not and perhaps cannot be actualized elsewhere."27
Certainly, "these small acts of resistance" can "offer some small
measure of encouragement" amidst the present's "seemingly insurmountable
obstacles, the quixotic search for a subject capable of world-historical
action, and the despair induced by the lack of one."28 But this is a
consolation, not a pathway to action per se.

Indeed, Hartman is wary even of consolation, as an affect of scholarly
rhetoric. At the heart of "Venus in Two Acts" is Hartman's confession
that, enthralling as it is to imagine "the glimpse of beauty, the
instant of possibility" amidst the abject terror of the Middle
Passage,29 doing so would have been grossly inappropriate: "I wanted to
console myself and to escape the slave hold with a vision of something
other than the bodies of two girls settling on the floor of the
Atlantic."30 The possibility-awakening maneuvers of Lose Your Mother and
later Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments emerge, then, not as a single
monological thesis about hope, but as tenuous approaches to a problem
ricocheting through her work, which she articulates in the seminal "The
Position of the Unthought:" "narrat\[ing\] a certain impossibility, to
illuminate those practices that speak to the limits of most available
narratives to explain the position of the enslaved."31 Not salvation, at
least not immediately, but explanation. And so from the vantage of
2007--8, critical fabulation emerged as one imperfect experiment in a
long endeavor to narrate slavery's afterlife---bold, certainly, but
certainly not vouchsafed in its attempt to "pr\[y\] open the dead
book."32

In 2024, speaking to a broad cohort of scholars who are at least
notionally committed to constructive politics,33 it's easy to read Muñoz
or Hartman and to use rhetoric like theirs and feel encouraged by our
own audacity to fundamentally rethink the structure of reality. But the
context that made their work bold and explosive has changed; when their
positions are firmly mainstream, declaring the power of possibility
isn't so bold as it seems.

In Muñoz's and Hartman's work, there is a clear admission of theodicy.
Neither queer utopianism nor critical fabulation are masturbatory
bacchanals of possibility; they are the often whimsical and sometimes
funny but always serious work of navigating in a world where Death
rules. Such sobriety is often lost in the possibility politics that
follows from and casually invokes them. It is not that such scholarship
is happy-go-lucky; on the contrary, it often inhabits the grim realities
of ecocide, white supremacy, and imperial violence. But the difference
that makes a difference is the engagement with disciplined action, or a
lack thereof. [This sort of scholarship **entwines** scholarship with
acts of resistance]{.underline}---[things might seem
horrible]{.underline}, [but the act of
care/imagining-otherwise/resistance that is writing itself will save
us!]{.underline}---[but doing so]{.underline}, to me, [seems
**conveniently nonspecific** when it comes to political
action]{.underline}. [[It runs the risk of making suffering an
**affective backdrop**]{.underline},]{.mark} [easily redeemed [by the
promise we can build a different world merely by **doing what we're
already doing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The reader can be engulfed in
**vaporous hope**]{.underline}, [a sense that they can make the world
better]{.underline}, that in fact the world will get better, [just by
**reading**]{.underline} this book. Possibility politics doesn't
necessarily push readers toward action so much as help them to get out
of bed each morning.

It's hard to sneer at this. Who among us (and by us I mean the quite
narrow category of person holding or with a path to holding an advanced
degree) doesn't need to be helped out of bed? But simultaneously, that's
just what it takes to be an ethical actor in a difficult world, not an
end in itself. This is why [the **danger** of possibility is precisely
its empowering claim]{.underline}, [its ability to let us feel that
we're **doing the work** when the most we're doing]{.underline} (in that
moment, anyway) [is **reading** or **writing**]{.underline}. I don't
mean this as indulgent self-flagellation or crocodile tears about ivory
tower intellectualism. It's merely a statement of fact: [more
**gestures** to possibility do not necessarily lead to more
**action**]{.underline}.

### Topical Action=Possible---1NC

#### Topical action is possible. Indigenous understandings of land are mutually exclusive with the use of the state. Cooperation shifts the frame of lawmaking and allows us to solve rising issues in the Arctic.

Third, [Arctic policymakers and scholars should consider that shared
sovereignty may be a more equitable and historically grounded version of
Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}. From an Indigenous perspective,
[sovereignty]{.underline} has a **[different meaning]{.underline}** and
can be [helpful here when imagining how a shared sovereignty can work in
the real world.]{.underline} First, Indigenous [conceptions of
sovereignty are social and cultural ways of understanding
community]{.underline} -- and thus sovereignty is often linked to an
ability to carry out normal life activities. Therefore, [shared
sovereignty in the Arctic can reflect that, **acknowledging** that
geopolitical **competition** and increased oil and gas extraction are
threats to that sovereignty]{.underline}. Second, [Indigenous
approaches]{.underline} to sovereignty also [take a **relational
approach,**]{.underline} thinking [about how **land and people
interrelate** and the importance of being heard in deliberations between
people]{.underline}. In action, this could mean **[focusing more on the
Arctic institutions that exist]{.underline}** and [giving more power to
Indigenous People in those institutions to be heard and
speak]{.underline} rather than giving power to states alone. In a future
[**Arctic** that will be inevitably changed by the **advent of climate
change**]{.underline}, [people and **collectives** will have to **work
together** to solve these larger collective-action
problems.]{.underline} This feeds into a third way that Indigenous
sovereignty can inform shared sovereignty. While Westphalian sovereignty
treats land as an exploitable resource[, Indigenous sovereignty sees
land as something to be cared for, the other part of a reciprocal
relationship between people and land.]{.underline} What use is having
sovereignty over a place if it is not cared for or is not productive?
[Shared sovereignty in action here would be a **reframing of the
Arctic** as a place for cooperative action to care for the land as the
primary objective of sovereignty.]{.underline}

Ferguson (\[ 5\]) refers to as \"minority difference\". Like the state
and capital, [[the academy]{.mark} now [**takes up** insurgence from
oppressed communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[adapting]{.mark}**
hegemonic practices [to **discipline** the challenge]{.mark} this
represents to dominant actors]{.underline}. Together, these strategies
impede and frustrate radical calls for change in the university.

[No matter the institution]{.underline}, [the approach to nullification
is the **same**]{.underline}. [There is an open]{.underline}, public
[acknowledgement of the stated grievance]{.underline}. This is followed
by the formation of a committee of so‐called representatives from
equity‐seeking groups. Following (and just as often not following) the
advice of the committee, [[the university]{.mark} will put forward a
solution]{.underline}. [The solution [responds to]{.mark} the [**surface
issues** while doing **little** to address structural]{.mark} power
[imbalances]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We see this pattern **again** and
**again**]{.underline}, and we need to ask ourselves how places that
purport to be about higher learning, and that are fully capable of
assessing effectiveness, are so wedded to approaches that don\'t work.
The reason is that [[these approaches are **not meant to
work**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [they are not meant [to produce
**substantive shifts** in]{.mark}]{.underline} the regular business of
[[the university]{.underline}]{.mark}. I am reminded of \[ 4\] where the
Antillean scholar and poet argues that [colonial projects employ
a]{.underline} \"**[[forgetting machine]{.underline}]{.mark}**\"
[designed to **[erase]{.mark}** any [comprehension of]{.mark} their
[ongoing harms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Strategies of nullification
deployed within our universities constitute such a]{.underline}
\"**[forgetting machine]{.underline}**\".

#### Vote neg on [presumption]{.underline}. Validating the presentation of 'new' scholarship [reproduces]{.underline} imperial ways of knowing. 

**Azoulay, et al, 23**---Professor of Modern Culture and Media at Brown
University (Ariella, with Lisa Lowe, Maya Caspari, and Ruth Daly,
"Against Imperial Knowledges: Lisa Lowe and Ariella Aïsha Azoulay in
Conversation," Parallax, 2023, Vol. 29, No. 2, 154--172, dml)

Maya: To pick up on that, Ariella, if I understand correctly, you're
trying not to 'read' as this implies a hierarchical subject-object
opposition, or seems to foreclose the tactile, reciprocal, contingent
nature of an encounter with an object or archive? So,
'[**[reading]{.underline}**']{.mark} here [[is]{.mark} both]{.underline}
a metaphor for [[an **imperial mode** of]{.mark} looking and [knowledge
production]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as well as an **actually-practised
methodology** in]{.underline} some (post)colonial institutions --
[how]{.underline}, for instance, [some academic [disciplines
**encourage** scholars to]{.mark} **identify** and]{.underline}
'[**[read]{.underline}**']{.mark} [particular [**objects of study** from
a position of **distant authority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If so, I want
to ask you a bit more about how you see the relationship between reading
as imperial technology, and reading as actual embodied practice, or
plurality of practices. I'm interested in the extent to which you think
it is possible to practise modes of 'reading' outside [this **imperial
framework**]{.underline}, especially [from **within** an academic
institution]{.underline}, or alternatively, the idea that 'reading'
otherwise from within, or along, colonial structures might produce
affects and meanings that are not contained by them?

Ariella: It's not that I don't read -- obviously I'm reading all the
time. The question is the way reading as a category or praxis defines
our disposition within an entire structure or network of power
relations. Why do we accept that what we are doing will be framed under
the category of 'reading' or, will be reduced to reading in a way that
we are interpellated to relate to others as our objects rather than the
people with whom we are interacting? Reading also [generates **imperial
distinctions**]{.underline} between for example primary and secondary
sources, that sustain the distinction between the tensions, etc.

We know that the people who struggled in 1492 are still here. So,
'speaking with others' is not a metaphor. It means [[we have to]{.mark}
be **humble**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} have to
[**[refuse]{.mark}** the position offered to us as if we have **any
advantage** over them]{.underline}, [since we are [coming up
with]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[new]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[ideas and
**different** ways of **reading**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a history of
readings [premised on the quality of the **newest**]{.underline}.
[[When]{.mark} acknowledging our place in the world and [attending to
the struggles of others **beyond** the way]{.mark} that [they
are]{.mark} inscribed [in]{.mark} different
**[texts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[what we are doing **cannot** be
reading]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.mark} rather
**[interacting]{.mark}** with]{.underline}, [**joining** or
**amplifying** others' struggles]{.underline}.

Lisa: To support what Ariella is saying, of course we are always reading
like we're breathing. I mean, there are different ways of doing it, and
it's rather [when [reading]{.mark} is a part of a **disciplinary**
practice of **extraction** and **mastery**]{.underline}, [then it
[becomes]{.mark} a kind of [**exercise** over]{.mark} a piece of
[**property** that]{.mark} **very much [conforms]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} the types of **[[imperial social
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** that we're describing. So,
[it]{.underline} seems as if Ariella [is]{.underline} dramatising and
seeking a modality of engagement that isn't [about]{.underline}
subordination and possession and extraction but being with or
interdependent with and so forth.

I think that's very much what Ann Stoler is describing in her concept of
reading along the archival grain. So, as much reading against the
archive and refuting what the archive presents, but also reading along
it: seeing its power, as well as what it cannot control.

Ariella: When I think again about your discussion of 'Vanity Fair' and
C.L.R. James, Lisa, I think that you do not introduce him as a literary
reader of the novel, but rather stage a different situation across the
temporalities in which you, him, and the novel encounter each other. The
different objects you bring in are also not simply read -- they are
mapped, sensed; they display the itineraries of their fabrication and
circulation. It is not just thickening the reading but [**refusing** the
power relationship]{.underline} that reading imposes, [which situates us
in **academia**]{.underline}, [and as **external** to previous struggles
that took place **outside** of its walls]{.underline}.

When you study empire you never study it alone. It's not only me and
Lisa. It's us joining [[**millions** of]{.mark} other
people]{.underline} who [**resist** imperialism's epistemologies and
ontologies]{.underline}. And [these [struggles **cannot** be organised
in piles]{.mark} of **[texts]{.mark}** that we read]{.underline}. [The
question is how we]{.underline} keep these previous struggles here, now,
present, and [[**refrain** from the way academia **commands** us
to]{.underline}]{.mark} discover, to unearth, to [[come up
with]{.underline} '**[groundbreaking]{.underline}**'
[work]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in those cases
[[would mean **stealing people's struggles**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[There **cannot be anything groundbreaking** about resisting
empires]{.underline}. [[We have to]{.mark} continue to find the words to
**resist** it]{.underline}, [to [say the
**obvious**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- how much empire is toxic -- [but
arriving at [this]{.mark} obviousness [can take a **decade**]{.mark}
every time]{.underline}. So, [we have to **reject the toxic vocabulary**
of academia and acknowledge that we are rehearsing our language to be
able to see the same toxicity that our ancestors
experienced]{.underline}.

Lisa: That is so well evoked, i.e. 'staging a different situation across
the temporalities in which you, him and the novel encounter' one
another. In addition, I think your book is continually doing this,
seeing the importance of de-individualizing. Part of restoration or
repair is re-collectivising even if it means putting something back into
a community that has suffered a great deal of theft and obliteration.
There's a putting back in community or a re-communising (that's not a
word, but you understand what I mean). Because, especially in literary
studies -- which I'm imagining is where you're asking this from -- the
mandate, [the **imperative**]{.underline} is [to have the
**newest**]{.underline}, [**best** reading of that object]{.underline},
[and to **master** everything about it]{.underline}, which [is exactly
**conforming** to this kind of **imperial subjectivity**]{.underline}.

Maya: We were interested in whether 'otherwise' evokes some other,
contingent relation to what's gone before, rather than claiming newness;
in other words, not only in defining what the 'otherwise' entails, but
also in the mode of relation it enacts.

Lisa: I think one of the things that Potential History so powerfully
puts forward is this idea of **[[refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
[[is different than being]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[otherwise]{.underline}**']{.mark}, right? Because [being
otherwise]{.underline}, [[reading otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark},
[otherwise temporalities [still **leaves the dominant centre in
place**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, I think, what Ariella has been
[emphasising]{.underline} is [the need to **refuse** granting that
**centrality** to the dominant]{.underline}. And being committed to its
end.

Ariella: Yes, and [we cannot allow ourselves to forever invent the
otherwise]{.underline}, right? [It feels like **every new scholar** has
to struggle and to come up with an]{.underline}
'**[otherwise]{.underline}**', [but]{.underline} if you go back, you
realise that [people **already** understood this]{.underline}. So, [[how
do]{.mark} you find a way to [**join the choir** of the
anticolonial]{.mark}]{.underline}, [or of the anti-empire]{.underline},
[and [to make it **not new**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but to
amplify]{.mark} very strong [voices that didn't]{.mark} necessarily
**[publish books]{.mark}** but **resisted empires**?]{.underline}

Lisa: And of course, [[the academy is ready to **commodify**
the]{.underline} '**[new]{.underline}**']{.mark}. So [it **loves** and
**awaits** any kind of]{.underline} '**[otherwise]{.underline}**'.

#### Acting to prevent extinction is [good]{.underline}---reject Ks of instrumental action.

**Levine, 21**---David and Kathleen Ryan Professor of the Humanities at
Cornell University (Caroline, "The Long Lure of Anti-Instrumentality:
Politics, Aesthetics, and Sustainability," Modern Fiction Studies,
Volume 67, Number 2, Summer 2021, dml)

This [[critique]{.underline}]{.mark} has been crucial and persuasive.
But the argument against instrumentality in literary studies
[has]{.underline} gone a step further than Weber's Zweckrationalität.
That is, the most influential theorists in the field have [[warned
against **all instrumentality**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[not just
Western-style instrumental rationality]{.underline}, [but **all
means-ends thinking**]{.underline}. [All plans and programs are
dangerous]{.underline}, they say. [Even the most utopian visions of a
revolutionary future]{.underline}, for example, [only **re-entrench**
existing dominations]{.underline}. As Michel Foucault puts it: "to
imagine another system is to extend our participation in the current
system" (230). We are so stuck inside our own moment, the argument goes,
that we cannot imagine any genuine alternative to it. Adorno, though
deeply unlike Foucault in many ways, shares this position. He writes,
"One may not cast a picture of utopia in a positive manner" (qtd. in
Bloch 10). [What is productive instead]{.underline}, Adorno says, [is to
draw attention to what's **missing**]{.underline}: "the determined
negation of that which merely is . . . always points at the same time to
what should be" (12). [According to [this logic]{.mark}]{.underline},
[we do our best political work when we [dwell in]{.mark} **restless
[negativity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[using **imperfections** to
point]{.mark} beyond themselves [to **something undefined to
come**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This argument has lasted into our own time,
with numerous critics insisting on the political importance of refusing
to sketch out or plan for the future. "Revolution will come in a form we
cannot yet imagine" (11), Jack Halberstam writes: "We cannot say what
new structures will replace the ones we live with yet, because once we
have torn shit down, we will inevitably see more and see differently and
feel a new sense of wanting and being and becoming" (6).

For these thinkers, the resistance to instrumentality is political. But,
of course, anti-instrumentality also underpins major theories of
aesthetics. Since Kant, a range of theorists have defined the aesthetic
precisely by its disturbance of means-ends thinking. Art cannot be
reduced to exchange and profit or to the communication of moral \[End
Page 226\] values or information. Art's strangeness and difficulty halt
the reflexive rush to calculability, efficiency, and utility. Strangely,
then, while anti-instrumentality grounds a range of political arguments,
from feminism to postcolonial theory, it also provides the basis for
antipolitical arguments in the aesthetic disciplines. According to
Langdon Hammer, for example, literary critics should stay away from
fantasies of having any kind of political impact because art should not
serve ends other than itself. Jonathan Kramnick argues that the
discipline of literary studies rests on "the norm of the open question";
it is the job of the critic "to state and explore problems rather than
provide solutions to them" (27). This disciplinary obligation emerges
out of our focus on the aesthetic, "if only because considering artworks
as significant in their own right often means spelling out the
open-ended or unresolved." And so, at the same time that we find
anti-instrumentality at the heart of the work of radical Black studies
thinker Moten, we also find it central to the work of Derek Attridge,
perhaps the field's most influential champion of aesthetic autonomy.

[Anti-instrumentality also underlies]{.underline} specifically ethical
arguments in literary studies---calls to humility in the face of a
complex world no one should try to master. Environmental humanists have
been especially committed to replacing teleological accounts of heroic
human action---which is also typically conquest and exploitation---with
[an embrace of]{.underline} what Anna Tsing calls "[open-ended
assemblages of **entangled ways of life**]{.underline}" (viii). Although
Haraway argues that instrumentality is inevitable because species must
use each other for survival, she, like Tsing, invites readers to learn
"to be truly present, not as a vanishing pivot between awful or edenic
pasts and apocalyptic or salvific futures, but as moral critters
entwined in myriad unfinished configurations of places, times, matters,
meanings" (1). Both embrace the pause, the need to stop to notice and
reflect on the now, interrupting the usual rush to profit and progress.
Both insist, too, on open-endedness, the refusal to give a definite
shape to future worlds. In this respect, the environmental humanities
reinforces the long tradition of opening ourselves to the unknown to
come.

In short, from Marxist critique to decolonial resistance and from
aesthetic autonomy to deep ecology, the common logic of
anti-instrumentality subtends otherwise conflicting schools of thought.
But what is it exactly that they share? [There is one common
urge]{.underline}: **[negation]{.underline}**, [the desire to **crack
the world open** to alternatives to the status quo]{.underline}, to
beckon to unmapped and unmappable possibility. And so, if you look at
almost any essay or book in literary or cultural studies, [its
conclusion will be a **deliberate open-endedness**]{.underline}, a
soaring \[End Page 227\] refusal to spell out specific paths forward.
Catherine Gallagher and Greenblatt, for example, write: "we sincerely
hope that you will not be able to say what it all adds up to; if you
could, we would have failed" (19). Alexander [**Weheliye** ends with
artists who]{.underline} "**[explode]{.underline}** both [the
individuated]{.underline} person and couple as [subject]{.underline} . .
. thus underscoring the messiness of these categories" (197). Fredric
Jameson marks "the now open space for something else" (296). Sara
Ahmed's The Cultural Politics of Emotion closes this way: "Justice
involves feelings . . . . Where we go, with these feelings, remains an
open question" (202). Christina [**Sharpe** urges readers]{.underline}
"[to stay in this **wake**]{.underline} time that would inhabit a
blackened consciousness that would rupture the structural silences
produced and facilitated by, and that produce and facilitate, Black
social and physical death" (22). And Robert **[McRuer]{.underline}**
[ends]{.underline} his book on queerness and disability [with
the]{.underline} "[promise that we will always **comprehend disability
otherwise** and]{.underline} that we will, collectively, [somehow access
other worlds and other futures]{.underline}" (208). Critics of all
stripes issue the same call: refuse the status quo in favor of an
unknowable world to come.

The Politics of Anti-Instrumentality

It is strange that anti-instrumentality can work as a distinctively
apolitical aesthetic value as well as a deliberately, explicitly
political one, and it is this particular convergence that draws my
attention in this essay. What is it, exactly, that allows
anti-instrumentality to cross back and forth so easily between artistic
autonomy and political purpose? The answer, I think, is this: when the
art work is understood as an end in itself, when it is cast as an object
that resists dominant institutions and refuses to serve powerful agents,
then in this precise capacity, art is doing political work. That is, as
long as art is free from ends, it can yield pleasures and thoughts and
possibilities that are not subject to dominant pressures and purposes.
And emancipation from dominant ends is nothing if not a political value.

In practice, this means that aesthetic autonomy can be readily
politicized. One famous story from the middle of the twentieth century
shows this paradox in action. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Soviets were
charging that the US was a shallow and materialist nation, obsessed only
with wealth and military might. In response, the US State Department
sought to showcase the many ways that the US allowed artists to thrive
in an atmosphere of unparalleled freedom. But it was hard to prove that
the democratic West fostered freedom and openness when the US government
was ready to shut down artists \[End Page 228\] with the wrong political
sympathies. After all, the House Committee on Un-American Activities was
publicly targeting writers like Langston Hughes, Dashiell Hammett, and
Bertolt Brecht at the very same moment, demanding that they testify to
their own noncommunist political loyalties and inform on others.

An especially embarrassing episode happened in 1947. The State
Department had sponsored a traveling exhibition called Advancing
American Art, which featured a range of innovative modern American
painters, including Georgia O'Keefe and Jacob Lawrence. At first it was
a huge success. Reports suggested that these bold and unexpected
paintings had actually begun to persuade audiences in Eastern Europe and
Latin America that the US was capable of experimental, original art. The
State Department planned to take the show to Guatemala, Iran, and
Cambodia. But when the US Congress and the press found out about the
exhibit, there was a huge public stink. The paintings were called
subversive and alien. One congressman from Mississippi said, "No
American drew these crazy pictures!" (qtd. in Littleton and Sykes 41).
Public pressure forced the State Department to cancel the show.

It was in this context that CIA strategists launched a covert arts
program. The goal was to prove that the West was home to exciting,
highly original art that did not cater to specific political programs.
Against the Soviets' insistence that art serve the regime, the CIA would
showcase aesthetic autonomy and anti-instrumentality. Jackson Pollock,
as Frances Stonor Saunders explains, seemed like a perfect vehicle to
prove the Soviets wrong. Defiant and anticonventional, Pollock
exemplified an avant-garde American creativity that refused mass culture
and Hollywood glitz. He had been widely mocked and condemned by the
press, but this was all to the good, from the CIA's point of view. While
the Russians forced their artists to work in the style of Socialist
Realism, the CIA secretly supported mass media coverage of "Jack the
Dripper" to prove that the US let even the strangest and most unpopular
artists flourish.

The CIA's role in cultural life in the middle of the twentieth century
is now widely known, but at the time they largely kept their operations
secret through fake foundations and front organizations. The CIA
covertly funneled resources to the literary magazine Encounter and to
the Chekhov Publishing House, which printed the works of Vladimir
Nabokov and other Russian emigres. It supported the Nigerian little
magazine, Black Orpheus, which published some of the most influential
négritude writers, including Aimé Césaire and Léopold Senghor.1 Deborah
Cohn explains that El Mundo Nuevo, the \[End Page 229\] Paris quarterly
of Latin American writing, was exposed as a CIA venture early on, though
it earns a place in literary history for publishing the first chapters
of Gabriel García Márquez's Cien años de soledad in 1966, as well as
works by Octavio Paz and Mario Vargas Llosa. The Cold War Program for
Cultural Freedom was a major source of support not only for artists and
writers but also for the humanities in US universities. The CIA provided
funding for academic programs in Asian and Latin American studies,
foreign languages, and American literature. It was Cold Warrior Richard
Nixon who poured money into the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)
and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Cuts to the NEA and
NEH began in 1990, shortly after the Berlin Wall fell. If we look back
nostalgically to a time when there was ample support for the arts and
humanities, we should not overlook the importance of Cold War ends to
this flourishing.2

What matters here is that [the CIA figured out how to
**instrumentalize**]{.underline}---we might [even]{.underline} say,
**[weaponize]{.underline}**---the [anti-instrumentality]{.underline} of
the aesthetic. [They saw that difficult]{.underline}, [experimental art
could stand for freedom from political ends]{.underline}, [and then they
put that freedom to political ends]{.underline}. And [this was **not a
misuse** or **misunderstanding**]{.underline} of artistic
anti-instrumentality. As Peter Kalliney argues, African writers in the
period also embraced aesthetic autonomy for both political and
antipolitical ends, including "emancipation from colonialism;
independence from the postcolonial nation-state; avoidance of politics
in order to foster collaboration among multiple constituencies; freedom
from politics altogether as a professional disposition; and ideological
neutrality in the Cold War" (337).

Again, we might well ask what position could possibly underpin this
complex and conflicting list, uniting thinkers as radically different as
Nixon and Halberstam, Paz and Césaire. But, again, I think there is an
answer: [it is a **specifically indiscriminate** version of political
negation]{.underline}. That is, [anti-instrumentality
can]{.underline}---and does---[set itself against **any
end**]{.underline}. [It can challenge]{.underline},
[unsettle]{.underline}, [and negate]{.underline} any constraint, any
rule, and **[any plan]{.underline}**. The worldview underpinning all of
these many versions of anti-instrumentality is a dream of freedom from
all doctrines, dogmas, and programs.

This matters today because [it is precisely this account of
anti-instrumentality that has come to **pervade**]{.underline} literary
studies. Susan Stanford Friedman refers to it as the "gadfly position"
of the humanities (3). [As dominant institutions lumber
along]{.underline}, [imposing their oppressive norms]{.underline}, [it
is the job of artists and humanists to **annoy** and
**negate**]{.underline}, [to act as **constant irritants**]{.underline}.
But [this means that its refusals of ends can]{.underline} \[End Page
230\] [go in **any direction**]{.underline}---the goal is to resist,
unsettle, or puncture any program at all.

What seems crucial to stress, then, is that
[[anti-instrumentality]{.mark} **does not necessarily align** with the
Left]{.underline}. [It [can motivate both **Cold War spies** and those
keen to **avoid politics altogether**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [what
is]{.underline} perhaps [most disturbing right now is the **eerie
similarity** between the language of anti-instrumentality]{.underline}
in literary studies [and the language of the political
**Right**]{.underline}. Leaders like Donald [**Trump** and]{.underline}
Jair [**Bolsonaro** use anti-establishment rhetoric in the
interest]{.underline}, they claim, [of freeing people from oppressive
norms and state regulations]{.underline}. In an unsettling echo of
writers and critics on the Left, these right-wing authoritarian leaders
embrace a disruption of rules and a shattering of institutions in order
to resist what they cast as the oppressive norms of the status quo.

Sustainability, or Collective Continuance

I argue here that it is particularly urgent for the Left to reconsider
our longstanding attachment to anti-instrumentality at this moment of
rapid and destabilizing climate change. [[Ecocritics]{.mark} have argued
especially strenuously against **all** instrumentalizing
programs]{.underline}, [[insist]{.mark}ing that [**any** teleological
thinking is **in cahoots** with capitalism and
colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, and only re-entrenches the destructive
ideologies that caused the climate crisis in the first place. [Refusing
to coerce others into exploitative use or service]{.underline}, [they
take a principled stand in favor of **passivity** and **deliberate
political withdrawal**]{.underline}. Anne-Lise François, for example,
turns toward "recessive action" (xvii)---the "nonappropriative" (xxiv),
minor gesture that rejects any illusion of human mastery or conquest.
And Anahid Nersessian argues, "For better or worse, works of art resist
practical application or problem-solving" (2), which means that the task
of the aesthetic disciplines is to face the "traumatic knowledge that
climate catastrophe is certain and unfathomable."

[There is something **attractively pure** about refusing all complicity
with capitalism and colonialism]{.underline}. [But [there is]{.mark}
also a [strange logic to the arg]{.mark}ument [that]{.mark} any attempt
to slow or stop global warming would be **so much in keeping [with
instrumental reason]{.mark}** []{.mark}that [we have **no choice but
to**]{.mark} **surrender** to the climate catastrophe]{.underline} to
come. [Can it be true that our only ethical option is to **[accede
to]{.mark} our own [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[not to
mention]{.mark} the extinction of **many human** and **nonhuman others**
in the process?]{.underline} Or, to put this another way,
[**acquiescing** to forces of
**[massive]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [**global
[destruction]{.mark}** [that will intensify the suffering
of]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 231\] [[the world's poorest]{.mark}
is **not a recognizably leftist position**]{.underline}, if by the Left
we mean a political commitment to collective, egalitarian flourishing.

Thus, it is my central argument here that our own historical moment
demands a reconsideration of aesthetic and political
anti-instrumentality on the Left. As neoliberal economics undoes hopes
of secure work and as fossil fuels radically disrupt longstanding
ecosystems, [the most urgent threat facing people around the world is
not **oppressive stasis** but **radical
instability**]{.underline}---[intensifying poverty and food
insecurity]{.underline}, [flooding]{.underline}, [forest
fires]{.underline}, [violent conflicts over water]{.underline}, [and the
rapid extinction of species]{.underline}. In literary studies, [we have
been so focused on refusing to serve ends that we have not often
developed resources for working for reliable **food**]{.underline}, for
example, [or safe and stable **shelter**]{.underline}. [With the rapid
onrush of **climate catastrophes**]{.underline}, [these basic conditions
are **increasingly under threat**]{.underline} for the world's poor.
[[Open-endedness is **not**]{.mark} primarily a source of [pleasure and
excitement for those who are anxious about **finding their next meal**
or a **safe place to sleep**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I claim that justice
demands a focus on the mundane work of sustaining living bodies over
time, which requires adequate nutrition, breathable air, clean water,
and stable shelter. [Anti-instrumentality turns our attention **away**
from solving these problems to focus instead on
**withdrawal**]{.underline}, **[inaction]{.underline}**, [and
**mourning**]{.underline}. The usual logic of literary studies is, in
short, a logic of antisustainability.

So, what is the alternative? I propose an affirmative instrumentality in
literary studies. While humanists have been fully justified in resisting
pressures to put bodies and ideas to work in the service of violent and
inequitable systems, I do not believe that it follows that we should
avoid all ends. [Not only has this insistence lent itself to an
**indiscriminate [politics of undoing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but it
has also [left]{.mark} the tasks of designing and [building social
life]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the social and natural sciences,
[**[government]{.underline}**, [and **business**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As long as literary studies imagines its role as [refusing and negating
all practical plans and projects]{.underline}, it [will continue to
**yield** the power to shape the world to other
disciplines]{.underline}. What if, instead, we saw it as the central
political task of literary studies to figure out how to sustain
collective life over time with some degree of justice and mutual care?

To be sure, a number of scholars, including Leerom Medovoi and Timothy
Morton, have roundly critiqued the term sustainability. As often
embraced by businesses and environmental activists, sustainability
implies the continuation of life as we know it, which for many in the
business world includes expectations of ongoing economic growth,
competition, and accumulation. It is certainly true that if we work to
sustain current systems---including global markets and \[End Page 232\]
extractive industries---we become complicit with the most rapacious
forces on earth. And yet, our dominant systems are in fact dramatically
unsustainable. The current pace of extraction and emission is making the
planet uninhabitable for humans and vast numbers of other species.

From this perspective, sustainability is in fact a neutral term. It
refers to the capacity to keep any state of affairs going over time. It
can include both just and unjust conditions. What climate change has
made suddenly clear is that sustaining must be a goal on the Left as
well as the Right. We are now faced with a struggle to keep collective
life going at all. A more appropriate focus than rupture and
open-endedness, then, would be the goal of a genuine
sustainability---the vast and urgent project of sustaining collective
life over generations.

A revaluing of sustainability will mean a turn to the ordinary work of
maintenance, a celebration of the work that keeps life going every day.
I draw inspiration here from feminist thinkers such as Mierle Laderman
Ukeles, Luce Giard, bell hooks, and Susan Fraiman, who have argued for
decades that the artistic emphasis on negations and revolutionary
ruptures have meant too little respect for the tasks and values that are
crucial to keeping bodies alive, including maintenance and caretaking.
And it is true that Leftists and artists have often ignored or devalued
certain necessary labor, such as the reproduction and maintenance of
daily survival, which is so often women's work---from literal
reproduction to the ongoing care of bodies through the preparation of
food, care for the sick, and the daily upkeep of environments. This kind
of labor is not necessarily creative, heroic, or radically emancipatory.
It is practical and repetitive. It has to happen in many of the same
ways every day. But no human sociality has ever taken shape without it.

The thinker who best captures the task before us is indigenous
philosopher Kyle Powys Whyte, who coins the term "collective
continuance" (345). Whyte argues against the common stereotype that
indigenous societies are static. All collectives, he points out, have to
develop strategies for adapting to new conditions. Food systems, for
example, are integral to the survival of both bodies and communities,
but they are also always subject to external forces, such as storms and
floods. "**[[Collective continuance]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he argues,
"is a society's overall adaptive capacity to maintain its members'
cultural integrity, health, economic vitality, and political order into
the future and avoid having its members experience preventable harms"
(353). Some adaptation, and some transformation, will always be
necessary. This approach does not set up an opposition between
conservation and innovation, \[End Page 233\] or between traditional and
modern societies. Rather, it [requires us to think]{.underline} justly
[about]{.underline} what to maintain in the face of inevitable change.
Integral to this approach is [[the **prevention of foreseeable future
harm**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a basic political responsibility [to ensure
the conditions for **intergenerational flourishing**]{.underline}.

Whyte's model of [collective continuance]{.underline} is especially
valuable because it [points to a kind of means-ends thinking that **does
not immediately fall back** into the trap of instrumental
rationality]{.underline}. [Collective continuance is an **end** that is
also an **ongoing means**]{.underline}. That is, [collective continuance
is the establishment of]{.underline} political, cultural, environmental,
and economic [conditions that allow collective life-worlds to **flourish
over time**]{.underline}: [it [is neither]{.mark} a **[top-down]{.mark}
conclusion** [nor a **superficial fix** but]{.mark} a set of **enabling
conditions**]{.underline}---an infrastructure for living. [To reject all
ends as constraining and oppressive is to **miss** the ways that some
fundamental conditions]{.underline}---clean water, fertile soil, and
breathable air---[are [the **preconditions** for **all other
activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Or, to put this another way, collective
continuance is a capacitating end, a crucial means of affording a range
of other ends.

Amartya Sen's influential capabilities approach to justice captures the
importance of understanding ends as means. Sen turns away from abstract
rights to the real constraints and possibilities people face when they
try to lead lives they value. In many places, women must depend on male
breadwinners for survival, for example, and transgender people cannot
move safely through the streets. These are injustices in Sen's terms
because they make it impossible for some groups to shape their lives
according to their values, while others can do as they wish. He is clear
that providing resources alone is not enough for justice: it does no
good to be given a food like pork if it violates one's religion to eat
it, or to be offered a job if one cannot travel to work. Although Sen
focuses most of his attention on fairly complex and contested values, he
assumes a broad consensus around "basic capabilities" (288): everyone
needs minimal standards of health, food, education, and shelter as a
precondition for achieving other ends. These basic capabilities are not
particularly interesting to many theorists of justice, but climate
change is threatening all of them right now---including air to breathe
and water to drink. Or, to put this another way, **[any acceptance of
the onrushing consequences of global warming is intolerably
unjust]{.underline}** in Sen's terms.

And so, I make the affirmative case here for a set of ends that are also
a means, a set of just and sustainable conditions that are themselves a
means to allow a rich variety of lives to continue into the future.
[[Anti-instrumentality]{.mark} is not the best approach to this
task]{.underline}, \[End Page 234\] especially [since]{.underline}, as
we have seen, [it [can]{.mark} also **[serve]{.mark} the interests of
[the Right]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In the name of **negating oppressive
norms** and **institutions**]{.underline}, for example, as Nadja
Popovich and others have shown, the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration [rolled back over]{.underline} 95 [environmental
regulations]{.underline}, including prohibitions on fracking on Native
lands, drilling in wildlife preserves, and dumping toxins in waterways.
From this perspective, we can see how an [excitement about resisting the
state can actually **hasten** the worst effects of climate
change]{.underline}.

This matters because the most important difference between Left and
Right lies not in our relationship to norms and institutions, but in the
way we understand enabling conditions---the infrastructures of
collective life. While the Right often justifies some amount of
starvation and homelessness as a necessary spur to economic
productivity, which they see as beneficial for everyone, the entire span
of the Left, from radicals to progressives, argues that it is unjust to
deny the most basic necessities of survival to anyone. Thus, across the
spectrum of the Left, radicals and progressives alike might begin not
from a resolute anti-instrumentality, but from a shared basic version of
justice that is both an end and a means: the urgent work of guaranteeing
basic capabilities for all. With this work as our horizon, we do not
have to choose between brutal exploitation and principled withdrawal, or
between acquiescence to the status quo and change so radical that it is
literally unimaginable. We can start the hard work of trying to build a
lasting infrastructure for multiple collective life-worlds to flourish
over time.

Practical Politics

The shift to an affirmative instrumentality in literary studies will not
be easy. It will mean a turn away from a politics of relentless negation
toward practical action, and turn away from an aesthetics of
experimentation, opacity, and difficulty toward a whole new canon of art
objects.

Pragmatism has often been a term of opprobrium in literary studies,
charged with confining us ever further within the brutal and corrupt
systems of the present. Anything short of pulling this whole rotten
society up by the roots is the same as quietism and complacency,
wishy-washy liberalism, or worse, sinister neoliberalism. Critics draw
on a long history of revolutionary thinkers who have opposed pragmatic
measures like reform in favor of the shattering work of revolution. At
least as far back as Marx in 1850, radicals have worried that social
welfare programs like healthcare and social security \[End Page 235\]
provide just enough in the way of comfort and security to prevent
workers from rising up as an angry mass, but without changing
fundamental economic structures.3 Accelerationists like Slavoj Žižek go
so far as to argue that we should hasten the worsening of conditions
because desperation is the necessary precondition for revolutionary
change. From this perspective, we should welcome mass starvation and
climate catastrophe because only these will spur the building of a just
society. The more moderate---and more pervasive---version of this logic,
which we can see in such thinkers different as Halberstam and Giorgio
Agamben, is that we should not work for small changes or half-measures
because these will prolong our acceptance of a fundamentally violent and
exploitative system.

But what if this refusal of pragmatic action is wrong? What if
institutional changes, [**[techno-fixes]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} ]{.mark}[**piecemeal [reforms]{.mark}** **[do
not]{.mark} necessarily [get in the way]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
large-scale structural change and can]{.underline}, in fact, **[serve
[revolutionary ends]{.mark}]{.underline}**? One strand of revolutionary
thinkers has understood organizing for achievable ends as important,
even necessary, steps in a larger revolutionary struggle. For Rosa
Luxemburg, famously, [the opposition between revolution and reform was a
**false dilemma**]{.underline}: "The struggle for reforms is its means;
the social revolution, its goal" (129). Women's suffrage was, for
Luxemburg, a crucial example. Raymond Williams, too, for many decades
understood reformist tactics as more effective at mobilizing
working-class people to act than the demand for an immediate smashing of
capitalism. In our own time, Chantal Mouffe advocates a "radical
reformism" (46) as a crucial tool for building a powerful populism of
the left. And against passionate arguments from fellow radicals, Angela
Davis has defended the legal reforms of Civil Rights and the election of
Barack Obama as important pieces of the Black radical struggle, not an
obstacle to it. Similarly, Sherry Wolf, a socialist organizer for LGBTQ
rights, has argued for the importance of gay marriage not as a
concession to an assimilationist pressure but as part of a larger fight
for Civil Rights for all. And here, surprisingly, is Žižek himself,
arguing that the [insistence on revolution]{.underline} in wealthy
countries actually [turns into]{.underline} the opposite---[a kind of
**perfectionism** that gets **stuck** because it does not have
**sufficient mobilizing power**]{.underline}. In this scenario,
revolution itself gets in the way of revolution:

In principle, the choice facing leftist politics is between
social-democratic reformism and radical revolution, but the latter
choice, although abstractly correct and true, is self-defeating and gets
stuck in Beautiful Soul immobility: in the developed Western societies,
calls for a radical revolution have no mobilising power. Only [[a
modest]{.underline}]{.mark} \[End Page 236\]
'[**[wrong]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[choice]{.underline}]{.mark} can
create the subjective conditions for an actual communist perspective:
[[whether it **fails** or **succeeds**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [[sets
in motion]{.mark} a **series** of [further demands]{.mark}]{.underline}
('in order to really have universal healthcare, we also need . . .')
[which will lead to the **right** choice]{.underline}. There is no
shortcut here, [the need for a radical universal change has to emerge by
way of **mediation** with **particular demands**]{.underline}. [[To
begin straightaway with the right choice is]{.underline}]{.mark}
therefore [[**even worse** than making a wrong
choice]{.underline}]{.mark}, as it amounts to saying 'I am right and the
misery of the world which got it wrong just confirms how right I am.'

\(lxxvii\)

Despite their many differences, these thinkers agree that [**vast
masses** of people are most inclined to mobilize around **immediate
causes** of suffering and **concrete demands**]{.underline}. And
[because revolutions take shape through the collective energy and
organization of **large numbers**]{.underline}, [the practical struggle
to transform existing conditions and institutions]{.underline}, such as
the fight for labor protections, voting rights, and marriage equality,
[is **necessary**]{.underline} work. From this perspective, it is a
mistake not to recognize the revolutionary potential in any leftist
campaign that draws and mobilizes large numbers, such as Black Lives
Matter or the LGBTQ Human Rights Campaign.

The crucial question here is a strategic one: how do social, economic,
political, and cultural transformation come about? Against a Marxism
that gives up on politics, which has been paradoxically seductive in
recent years, as Bruce Robbins argues in his 2013 essay "Balibarism!"
[this]{.underline} robust revolutionary tradition [invites us all to
**get our hands dirty** in imperfect politics]{.underline}, to focus on
mobilizing, organizing, and planning, [and to engage in]{.underline} the
unromantic, demanding work of [social transformation through **all
existing channels** for political struggle]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} elections, [battles for **legal
rights**]{.underline}, [and **institutions** like]{.underline} the
university and [the **state**]{.underline}. [Practical politics emerges
here as **crucial** to building skills]{.underline},
[organizations]{.underline}, [and collective power on the
Left]{.underline}, [all **preconditions** for radical structural
change]{.underline}.

[If **no stark decision** has to be made between revolution and
reform]{.underline}, [if movements]{.underline} across the Left [grow
powerful by joining forces in **messy**]{.underline}, **[impure
coalitions]{.underline}**, [and if short-term]{.underline}, [practical
struggles have the potential to serve **long-term radical
ends**]{.underline}, [then the wholesale refusal of pragmatism is
troubling indeed]{.underline}. [The argument]{.underline} dominant
across literary studies---[that we have an obligation to refuse **all**
arduous and imperfect struggles to **change conditions for the better**
in the here and now]{.underline}---[seems like **exactly the wrong way**
to work for justice]{.underline}.

How, then, might literary scholars participate in the struggle for
collective continuance? When it comes to climate change, both leftist
activists and humanities [[scholars]{.mark} have been quick to spot
problems]{.underline} \[End Page 237\] [in **every** [propos]{.mark}al
for environmental action]{.underline}. [We should not hope for
**techno-fixes**]{.underline}, for example---whether wind power,
geoengineering, or wildlife reclamation
projects---[because]{.underline}, as Jordan Kinder argues, [an ongoing
reliance on [technical knowledge]{.mark} **only [re-entrenches]{.mark}**
the assumption that [human subjects]{.mark} can dominate and manipulate
nature [and]{.mark} **deepens** [inequitable]{.mark} social
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor does it make sense to seek change
through electoral politics, if Timothy Mitchell is right, because our
government is what he calls a carbon democracy, where the dominant
"politics of economic calculation" (252) has itself developed out of our
dependence on fossil fuels. [We should not fight for **carbon
pricing**]{.underline}, even if it will bring down emissions globally
and quickly, [because]{.underline}, David Bush argues, [it continues the
**logic of capitalism**]{.underline}. Max Ajl makes the case that the
Green New Deal sustains the long history of Euro-American colonialism
and the exploitation of the Global South.

[[Since each movement is]{.mark} **imperfect** or
**[impure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[many **give up hope
altogether**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We need [a radical [revolution in
consciousness]{.mark}]{.underline}, we say, and by then it [[will be
**too late**]{.underline}.]{.mark} And yet, [even as the critiques of
each separate political project might be fair enough]{.underline},
[**together** they have **noticeably strengthened**]{.underline},
**[sustained]{.underline}**, [and **transformed** each
other]{.underline}, [providing **momentum** for larger and larger scales
of change]{.underline}. In recent years, as Kai Heron and Jodi Dean
argue, a strong new coalition for environmental justice has taken shape
that joins "scientists, indigenous rights activists, and proponents of
social justice," despite differences in epistemic positions and methods.
This coalition has not only successfully shifted mainstream audiences
away from climate denialism, but it has also strengthened the claims of
each group by connecting them to the others. "Allied with science,
environmentalists shed their eco-hippy personae to become
representatives of a fact-based critique of mass consumption"; "the
leadership of indigenous people \[grew\] to national and international
prominence as they forged collective opposition to pipelines and
fracking"; and "Attention to sacrifice zones, slow death, and the
persistent deprivations of environmental racism helped environmentalists
move beyond the elitist image long associated with conservationism."
Increasing numbers of university scientists have found their work
transformed for the better by alliances with indigenous communities, and
racial justice organizations, from the NAACP to Black Lives Matter, have
incorporated the fight against climate change and pollution into their
daily work. Each part of the struggle can draw strength from the others,
and all can work together to advance the work of climate justice. [An
[alternative to pessimistic inaction]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[might
be]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[anything that moves the
ball]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[End Page 238\]
**[[forward]{.underline}]{.mark}**," as Democratic Representative Salud
Carbajal of California puts it (qtd. in Worland).

[Left pessimism]{.underline}, according to Heron and Dean,
[is]{.underline} not only wrong but also **[dangerous]{.underline}**.
[Leftists have managed to **displace** climate denial from fossil fuel
interests]{.underline}---where it began---"[into their own
arguments]{.underline}, [**shielding** themselves from the overwhelming
burden of action]{.underline}." [The]{.underline} "**[burden of
action]{.underline}**" [is **overwhelming**]{.underline}, indeed, [if we
assume that **no work is worth doing** apart from **immediate** and
**total revolution**]{.underline}, demolishing every constraint and
every institution, [or if we must conduct pure and virtuous campaigns
that avoid all impress of ourselves on the world]{.underline}. [But the
burden **lifts**]{.underline}, [if we imagine ourselves as working with
the materials we have to build]{.underline} a larger movement for
**[collective continuance]{.underline}**.

### Anti-Anti-State---2AC

#### We're [anti-anti-state]{.underline}.

**Gordon, 24**---Associate Professor of Political Science and Africana
Studies at University of Connecticut (Jane Anna, "Creolising the
State?," Theoria, Volume 71: Issue 181 (Dec 2024), dml)

In Statelessness and Contemporary Enslavement (2020), I offered a brief
defence of the state in what I preliminarily termed an
**[anti-anti-statism]{.underline}**. I formulated it this way to
[acknowledge that]{.underline}, [given the **active complicity** of
states in the production of **statelessness** and]{.underline}
conditions that foster [contemporary **enslavement**]{.underline}, [it
is **not hard** to recognise the appeal of **anarchistic**
approaches]{.underline} amongst some of the most politically committed.
As was true in the first quarter of the twentieth century, contemporary
[states appear as primarily **predatory** and
**kleptocratic**]{.underline}, [either **unable** or **unwilling** to
counteract]{.underline} the [precariousness]{.underline} created by
current political economic developments and their violently xenophobic
expressions.

Still, I argued, as indispensable as [these insights]{.underline} are,
they [must be mobilised to formulate a **viable
anti-anti-statism**]{.underline}. After all, [conceiving global
responses to developments that have made vulnerability highly lucrative
**must involve governments** and **political
institutions**]{.underline}. What is more, in most versions
[anti-statism rests on a **logical circularity** in which political
institutions that are **not liked** are synonymous with **states** while
responsive]{.underline}, [legitimate ones are called **something
else**]{.underline}. [Rather than letting the exploitative
instantiations of the state or instances of state capture **monopolise**
and **exhaust** the term]{.underline}, [the state must also include the
deeply imperfect **New Deal** government]{.underline} of Franklin D.
Roosevelt [and experiments in **Caribbean socialism** that
produced]{.underline}, amongst other outcomes, the free medical training
offered by [the **Cuban healthcare system**]{.underline}. Surely
'**[states]{.underline}**' [include neo-fascist varieties]{.underline},
[political institutions that expand human freedom]{.underline}, [and
everything in between]{.underline}. If so, [the question is **not**
whether we are **for** or **against** states but about the **kinds** of
political institutions we need and **how** they are
constructed]{.underline}. As Alix Olson and Alex Zamalin write: 'If
democracy is intended to be enacted by the people, then the state itself
is ours to reimagine and those desires are to be collectively acted
upon' (2024: 151).

This observation informs a second pragmatic one. [We **cannot cede**
existing states to those with **no aversions** to most of the globe
living in unsustainable conditions of unfreedom]{.underline}. [This
refusal is not achieved only through interacting with states through
**established channels**]{.underline}. [It also entails engaging in
activities that make it **politically dangerous** for such bodies **not
to respond** and that gives **leverage** to allies on the
**inside**]{.underline} who already accept a conception of sovereignty
as realised across porous borders. Crucial to such an approach is A.
Naomi Paik\'s observation that the activism of the rightless proceeds
from understanding that [the state]{.underline} '[is **not** a
**singular entity** but an]{.underline} intricate, multidimensional
[**assemblage** of forces]{.underline}.' The resulting 'cacophony
marshals immense force, and yet, [the work of these many moving parts is
inevitably **incongruous**]{.underline}, [sometimes even in **direct
conflict** with itself]{.underline}'. [These **internal contradictions**
create spaces through which the rightless]{.underline} '[can **contest**
the state\'s seemingly overwhelming authority]{.underline}' (Paik 2016:
13).

### Arctic Policy Advocacy Good---2AC

31.1 Against Neocolonialism

[We have become **increasingly attuned** to the **necessity of asserting
our rights** when dealing with]{.underline} transnational corporations
and [powerful state actors,]{.underline} and such [**actors** have in
turn become **increasingly aware** of the **necessity** of taking our
rights into account]{.underline} (Wilson 2016; Papillon and Rodon 2017).
[**[Foreign capital]{.mark}** and **[expertise]{.mark}** is
**[not]{.mark} in [itself]{.mark} [bad]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} it is [**[vital]{.mark}** to [ensure]{.mark}
that [foreign-led]{.mark} and financed economic [activities]{.mark} in
the Arctic **[serve the needs of Arctic peoples]{.mark}** as well in
order to prevent becoming caught up in neocolonial
processe]{.underline}s. From mining companies and fishing interests to
government authorities based in distant seats of power, [[we]{.mark}
**[must]{.mark} seek** to simultaneously be open to the world and
**[avoid]{.mark} [becoming ]{.mark}**a **[passive]{.mark}** cog in the
great machine of global capital and realpolitik.]{.underline}

The globalisation of corporate power is accompanied by a globalisation
of risk and of concern for Indigenous peoples and the future of the
Arctic. [As the world awakens to the dangers of climate
change]{.underline}, increasing attention is being paid to scientific
research into the Arctic, [[research]{.underline}]{.mark} that -- though
**[[often well-meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- is also often
[[embedded in metropolitan]{.mark} [mindsets]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
ultimately [[reinforce]{.underline}]{.mark} existing power
[[structures]{.underline}]{.mark}, priorities, and dependencies. Each
new scientific report produced from the metropole highlights new
challenges for Arctic peoples while advancing ever-more technocratic
discourses and globalist solutions. People the world over are at last
becoming aware of how important the Arctic is to them, yet this [growing
recognition]{.underline} is [not guaranteed]{.underline} to [result in
greater influence for Arctic peoples]{.underline}; it might just as
easily result in renewed metropolitan efforts to control developments in
the region to suit state or globalist interests -- perhaps at the
expense of those who make the Arctic their home. Indeed, [international
focus on climate change may]{.underline} in some cases [be politically
convenient for powerful actors]{.underline} rather than ideally suited
for improving the lives of those in the affected regions (Kelman et al.
2015; Baldacchino and Kelman 2014).

[[We **require** **knowledge**, **research**, and
**resources**]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
[outside]{.underline}]{.mark} [the region]{.underline} if we are
[[to]{.mark} undertake]{.underline} sustainable
[development]{.underline} and **[[take advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the **[[changing conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, [care
must]{.underline} be [taken]{.underline} to [[avoid]{.mark}
[buying]{.mark} [into]{.mark}]{.underline} or submitting to a
[[neocolonialisation]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic. Images of
melting glaciers and starving polar bears may galvanise the wider public
and power holders to action in a manner that is not beneficial to Arctic
peoples.

The peoples of the Arctic are not responsible for having produced global
environmental threats, yet **[metropolitan
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[calls]{.mark} upon [us to]{.mark}
forego]{.underline} economic [development]{.underline} and extractive
industries, [[take]{.underline} **[symbolic action
against]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[global
[challenges]{.mark},]{.underline}** and **[stand at the
vanguard]{.underline}** [of a new era of 'conspicuous
sustainability']{.underline} (Grydehøj and Kelman 2016). [Such
[efforts]{.mark} to persuade us to turn our lands and seas into nature
preserves, to transform our traditional territories into a form of World
Heritage and present the Arctic as a treasure belonging equally to the
world as a whole]{.underline}, are ultimately requests that we who have
been so long exploited and so thoroughly dispossessed further sacrifice
ourselves for the continued wellbeing of those who have proven unwilling
to make sacrifices. [[**Effective efforts** to **preserve**]{.mark}
[Arctic **environments** and **revitalise Arctic livelihoods** should
take **precedence over symbolic** **action**]{.mark} and 'conspicuous
sustainability' that provides little real benefit]{.underline} (Grydehøj
and Kelman 2016). **[[We do not ask to live from the charity of
metropolitan benefactors]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [We do not
wish]{.underline} [to be the realisation]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
metropolitan visions of happy, [hardy Northerners]{.underline} in need
of patronage from the forces of global capital. **[The last thing we
want is to be a canary in the coalmine, a cautionary tale]{.underline}**
(Farbotko 2010).

#### Arctic policymaking is key. Collective Arctic action that engages with state actors allows for a ruptural break from neocolonialism and guides the stolen capital of the West back into Arctic control, especially over contingent issues like climate crisis.

31.2 A New Era of Arctic Cooperation

[[If we are to guide change]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} rather
than merely become victims of it [or take on roles designed to appeal to
metropolitan sensibilities]{.underline}, it is [[necessary to
**accept**]{.mark} that **[change]{.mark}** is [occurring]{.mark} and
then **[commit]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [managing]{.mark} it.**]{.underline}
The Arctic is home to many peoples, who possess diverse sets of needs.
Yet [[we are **united**]{.mark} [by]{.mark} a number of shared -- if not
**[universal]{.mark}** -- [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can be
supported through **[[collective action]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whether
[[through **formal**]{.mark} **[bodies]{.mark}** that can
**[engage]{.mark} with [sovereign]{.mark}** [**states**]{.mark} or
through looser, more flexible coalitions of actors]{.underline}. What is
clear is that [Arctic sustainability depends on [long-term
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} across national borders
[[transcending]{.underline}]{.mark} [[single]{.underline}]{.mark}
[state, corporate]{.underline}, or even [ethnic
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, in light of the **[remarkable
interdependence]{.underline}** of Arctic peoples and environments
surrounding their shared sea.

[As Arctic peoples]{.underline}, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} [identify what we really want]{.underline}
so that we can begin **[[setting]{.mark} common
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} planning for and
**[[implementing]{.mark} strategic [actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
**[[taking on]{.mark} strategic
[responsibilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By [[creating]{.mark} a true
Arctic [community]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that works at [[multiple
levels of **formality**]{.mark} and through multiple
channels]{.underline}, we can at last truly gain a voice (Plaut 2012).
[An [openness]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [informal]{.mark}
political]{.underline} [organisation]{.underline}
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} [[complement]{.mark} a **dedication** to
constructing **[strong]{.mark}** institutional foundations for **[Arctic
policymaking]{.mark}** that reflects shared values and
priorities]{.underline}. As we work to define our own ethnic and
national identities, [we should seek to locate these within a wider
Arctic identity]{.underline}, one that can [enrich]{.underline} --
rather than overshadow -- our [localised values]{.underline}. Such a
multifaceted, [**[pan-Arctic]{.underline}**
**[policymaking]{.underline}**]{.mark} platform could
[[strengthen]{.mark} our [ability]{.mark} to [engage with]{.mark}
non-Arctic actors]{.underline} ([including]{.underline} metropolitan
interests within **[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that possess Arctic
territory]{.underline}), which are both [affecting and affected by
changes taking place within the Arctic]{.underline}. This contrasts with
current regional bodies and institutions, which often take a broad
state-centric perspective (for example, the Arctic Council and the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council) or a narrow focus on Indigenous interests
(for example, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and the Indigenous Peoples'
Secretariat): Both such perspectives are necessary and important, but
the former places agency in the hands of the metropole while the latter
risks creating false divisions between Arctic communities, erroneously
grouping the interests of Arctic non-Indigenous peoples with those of
the metropole.

Arctic economic, societal, cultural, and political development must be
led by Arctic peoples themselves, working to develop peaceful and
constructive relationships at the community, state, and other levels. A
sense of a shared stake in the Arctic can even help foster better
relationships between Indigenous peoples and former colonisers,
supporting a decolonial Arctic politics that regards all Arctic peoples
as equal -- understanding the consequences of historic injustice without
perpetuating ethnic and political animosity. Understanding today's
Arctic and envisioning a future Arctic requires acknowledgment that,
across much of the North, "the institutional and ideological
interference of the colonial period directly or indirectly, subtly or
overtly, continues to influence political thought and economic agendas"
(Nadarajah and Grydehøj 2016: 442; see also Grydehøj 2016).

[[These **must not**]{.mark}, however, [be **decisions made by a
local**]{.mark} **[elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
[important]{.underline} that the [entire]{.underline}
[population]{.underline} of the Arctic be [involved in the move toward
sustainable]{.underline} regional [development]{.underline} and come to
[understand the benefits to **collective action** and **collective
development.**]{.underline} At the same time, [desired
development]{.underline} outcomes [must be localised]{.underline}; [[no
longer]{.underline}]{.mark} can it be [[acceptable]{.underline}]{.mark}
for Arctic actors to [[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[competitive]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[zero-sum [games]{.mark} against
one another]{.underline}**. At the same time, as [we recognise that
shared development may require certain shared sacrifices]{.underline},
we must draw the line at sacrificing some communities solely in favour
of others.

31.3 Arctic Research and Education

This kind of [regional awareness and bottom-up
[policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline} [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}
enhanced knowledge on the part of Arctic peoples and an **[[improved
connection between science and policymaking]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Education]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to this, with actors such
as UArctic working to [build local capacity through
education]{.underline}. Yet it is important to be conscious of
neocolonial forces within education systems and to prevent the
development of an Arctic cultural elite that is distanced from knowledge
of ordinary communities across the region. Development planning is
increasingly driven by systemitisation, data collection, and
technocratic discourses, which often combine to privilege metropolitan
interests and expertise, leading to local suspicion of development and
planning in general (Pugh 2013, 2016).

Without denying the importance of 'evidence-based policymaking', it is
necessary to recognise that, in today's world, not all kinds of evidence
are treated equally. In particular, the experiences of Arctic Indigenous
peoples, who have centuries or millennia of experience living in close
interaction with nature, can contribute lessons in flexible livelihoods
and adaptability to harsh and changing environments (e.g. Pearce et al.
2015). [**[Climate change]{.mark}**, for example, will have
[serious]{.mark} and possibly even [disastrous repercussions]{.mark} in
some parts of the world, but this [change]{.mark} will [need to be
**dealt with**]{.mark}, and its effects on Arctic environments and
peoples may not be straightforwardly negative]{.underline}. It is vital
that Arctic policy breaks free from the crippling strictures of
neoliberal risk, vulnerability, and resilience discourse (Evans and Reid
2014). [**Scientific [research]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[evidence-based
policymaking]{.mark}** that is [sensitive]{.mark} [to Arctic
conditions]{.mark} may [reach]{.mark} quite [different]{.mark}
[conclusions]{.mark} [than]{.mark} research and [**policymaking** with a
metropolitan orientation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The scientifically and
technocratically motivated drive toward 'modernisation' asks Arctic
Indigenous peoples to submit to a developmental model that has proved
environmentally calamitous on the global scale and that has been applied
elsewhere with such poor results in earlier periods of decolonisation.
Involvement of Arctic peoples in Arctic research is a necessary but
insufficient condition for truly locally oriented research: The
framework, expectations, and design of the research must itself be
decolonised.

[[Arctic peoples]{.mark} [require]{.mark} an emancipatory and decolonial
[system]{.mark} of research and education]{.underline}, which
[[neither]{.mark} [turns its back on]{.mark} knowledge and cutting-edge
[scholarship]{.mark} [nor]{.mark} find itself [trapped]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} preconceived [notions]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the
creation of [colonial]{.mark}]{.underline} (or postcolonial)
[[subjects]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Scientific]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself -- from the humanities,
social sciences, and natural sciences -- [[should be undertaken]{.mark}
by or in close engagement [with]{.mark} people from a diverse [range of
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}, who can both contribute their own
perspectives to the wider scientific world and better communicate
findings to their own communities (Mulligan and Nadarajah 2008).
[**[Greater investment]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} Arctic [science]{.mark} is
**[critical for achieving Arctic sustainability]{.mark}** -- but [only
if]{.mark} this [science has]{.mark} firm [roots]{.mark} in Arctic
[communities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Arctic peoples share a number of cultural values but also possess
cultural distinctions from one another, which produces a rich seam of
traditional and Indigenous knowledge that can be drawn upon in
developing Arctic research and education. [**[Truly Arctic
research]{.mark}** and **[education]{.mark} [does not]{.mark}**
[**involve** **rejecting science** or **Western**]{.mark}
**[learning]{.mark}**;]{.underline} it instead [[**involves** the
**investment** of such knowledge with local values]{.mark} in order to
better serve local needs.]{.underline} To paraphrase Grant McCall
(1994[),]{.mark} Arctic studies must consider Arctic peoples on their
own terms, not on those of metropolitan well-wishers, development
workers, or political authorities.

31.4 Towards an Arctic Awakening

Global change is producing new challenges for peoples of the Arctic, but
it is also bringing us closer together. We cannot simply draw the line
at the individual community, ethnic group, nation, or even state: It is
vital for us all to get engaged with the shared Arctic project. By
grasping the necessity of change, we can enter a new era of regional
stability, shared purpose, and political power.

**[Change is coming.]{.underline}** We may find it daunting, yet [it is
up to us, the peoples of the Arctic, to say:]{.underline} [**We will
no** **longer be passive observers** of our development but **will take
charge of our futures.**]{.underline}

#### Youth engagement in Arctic scenario planning is key to developing skills that allows us to shape policy in the real world.

While [many different groups should be considered in scenario
exercises]{.underline}, we [highlight the importance of youth
engagement]{.underline} (see also Davison & Hawe, Citation2012; Glendøs
& Berliner, Citation2017; Kral, Salusky, Inuksuk, Angutimarik, &
Tulugardjuk, Citation2014; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, Ford, Shiwak, &
Wood, Citation2015; MacDonald, Ford, Willox, & Mitchell, Citation2015;
Ulturgasheva, Rasmus, & Morrow, Citation2015). Youth [perspectives have
been identified as a poorly developed strand in the study of Arctic
human developmen]{.underline}t (Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015;
Larsen & Fondahl, Citation2014). Furthermore, [young people]{.underline}
have [demonstrated]{.underline} both an interest and [legitimate stake
in being part of discussions about the future]{.underline} (Cost,
Citation2017; Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015). For [research
about potential future developments in the Arctic to be more
relevant]{.underline}, it will be [critical to understand their
priorities, aspirations, obstacles, and life paths]{.underline}. These
factors shape young people's individual futures, affect the viability of
Arctic cultures, languages, traditional activities, and communities, and
influence the capacity to navigate climate change and other external
pressures that shape environments and societies (e.g. Kowalczewski &
Klein, Citation2018; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, et al., Citation2015;
MacDonald, Ford, et al., Citation2015; Ulturgasheva, Rasmus, Wexler,
Nystad, & Kral, Citation2014). We [furthermore argue that working with
youth in participatory scenario exercises and workshops engages them in
shaping the future of their societies]{.underline}. Identifying factors
that youth consider pivotal could support relevant action and may thus
help sustain local human capital over time (Cost, Citation2017;
Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, et
al., Citation2015; Ulturgasheva et al., Citation2015). [Thinking about
the future can also be a useful complement to compulsory education and
other learning processes]{.underline} (e.g. social learning,
co-production of knowledge, or vocational training) (Cost,
Citation2015).

### Perm---2AC

#### [DO BOTH]{.underline}. The [action]{.underline} of the plan doesn't commit to any political or ideological stance.

dml)

The goals and requirements for membership and expected behavior of
members during the recruitment process and after admittance into the
revolutionary party differ widely from those of the mass organization.
Party members must be of one mind and move in lockstep with one another
politically and ideologically. This is a part of the Democratic
Centralism our party adheres to. Proper planning and preparation are
valued in both the party as well as the mass org. However, it is in the
mass org where the people will begin to embrace these values and, with
each passing success, be filled with the revolutionary consciousness and
confidence that has been stolen from them by this system. The various
PSO collectives and the National Secretariat, when it has been
established, should absolutely work from a plan of action that will
accurately reflect the current conditions. [A **plan**]{.underline} of
action [is **distinctly different** from a political line]{.underline}.
[Having and working according to [a plan **doesn\'t require political or
ideological unity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[We can all plan to go **skating**]{.underline} this weekend. [We can
lay out the **time**]{.underline}, [the **location**]{.underline}, [and
who all will be **attending**]{.underline}. [Those responsible
for]{.underline} the [planning]{.underline} of this outing [could be
communists]{.underline}, [anarchists]{.underline},
[Democrats]{.underline}, [Republicans]{.underline},
[Christians]{.underline}, [Muslims]{.underline}, [etc]{.underline}. [And
we can still have a **very successful event**]{.underline}. And that is
because [this plan [only]{.mark} requires **[programmatic
unity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [meaning that [we only]{.mark} have to
[agree on the **overall idea**]{.mark}]{.underline} of skating this
weekend [[and how we will **logistically carry this
out**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We **do not have to be of one mind**
politically or ideologically for this to happen]{.underline}. It is much
the same with the PSO and our 10 Point Program. One does not have to be
Maoist or even a communist to participate. [One simply needs to be in
unity with the ideas]{.underline} that people should have food, shelter,
education, and be allowed to be free of police brutality and terror,
etc.

A comrade asked in reference to this analogy, \"[But doesn't everyone
have a **reason** for doing that]{.underline} \[skating\]
[event?]{.underline} [And for not going to the park or the movies
**instead**?]{.underline} [And then wouldn\'t those reasons
**influence** what they do or don\'t do in the future?]{.underline} [It
seems that]{.underline} the [belief]{.underline} that people should have
food, shelter, education, and be free of police brutality and terror [is
**political** and]{.underline} that [those beliefs inform what they are
all are doing]{.underline}.\" They went on to say that \"PSO may not
have to have full ideological and political unity on the level of a
Party, but don\'t we have to have something, even if it\'s a lot less
comprehensive?\"

Yes! And that \"something\" is unity with the 10 Points. Which was
designed to meet the people exactly where they are at, and are things
that almost everyone in the oppressed communities can agree on despite
one\'s political or ideological views. Those 10 points and people
wanting to have access to those things are very much political ideas (as
is every other issue in society, as politics is defined as simply
concentrated economics or the very human desire to have food, shelter,
clothing, or resources with which to procure these things for ourselves
and our families/communities). But [[something being political in
**nature** and people\'s **stances** being
political]{.underline}]{.mark} - as every stance is political, even the
decision to be apolitical - [[**does not mean** that we all must **share
the same**]{.mark} **political** or **ideological [line]{.mark}** or
even **need** to]{.underline}, [in order [to **effect
change**]{.mark}]{.underline} on a programmatic level, which again, is
what the PSO is about.

Let\'s take the skating scenario a bit further. All of the [people
involved]{.underline} would definitely [have their **own reasons** for
agreeing to go skating as opposed to engaging in some other
activity]{.underline}. And [yes]{.underline}, [their reasons would be
**political** as is **everything**]{.underline}. [But those politics or
motives could **very well differ** from the others in the
group]{.underline} who agreed to go skating. So [[while everyone]{.mark}
who is involved in]{.underline} the [planning and execution]{.underline}
of this outing [is political [and their decisions]{.mark} to be a
part]{.underline} of this skating group [[are political]{.underline},
[they **would not all need to be unified**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**around the same political ideology** [to come up with a **successful
plan**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Some]{.underline} people [may have chosen skating for
**exercise**]{.underline} because they value physical fitness over the
other options, [some may]{.underline} have chosen to go because they
[enjoy the **nachos**]{.underline} served in the skating rink\'s food
court; and [others may be]{.underline} going because they were
**[bored]{.underline}** and this seemed like something easy and fun to
do; and [still others may]{.underline} have beef with the rink\'s owner
because they take issue with the condition of the rink, and believe that
the rink should be run by and for the community, and [hope to **win
support** from the other skaters for a political action]{.underline} at
the rink. That last group would be the party. [[We]{.mark} will many
times [**unite programmatically** with people whose politics are
**different**]{.mark} from ours [as long as the contradictions aren't
**antagonistic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with the hope of
winning]{.mark} the other groups to a [**deeper political
understanding** or of gaining **partial demands** that]{.mark} will
[**lay the groundwork** for]{.mark} later **[more]{.mark} complete** or
**[revolutionary gains]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We will lay plans with
these groups]{.underline} that in many cases will be successful [but
this is **not the same** as adhering to a **cohesive political** and
**ideological line**]{.underline}.

### AT: Arctic Sovereignty Ks

#### "Sovereignty" in the Western frame is not inevitable. Biases are shifting now and confronting climate change in the Arctic represents a unique opportunity to move to a collaborative model.

苗

Fourth, **[sovereignty is contextual]{.underline}**. In the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**, [this implies that any notion of **shared
sovereignty** specifically in the Arctic must include Indigenous
people]{.underline}, their traditional and ecological knowledge, and the
**[co-managing of Arctic issues]{.underline}**. Scholars acknowledge
that **[sovereignty is constantly evolving]{.underline}** and thus we
[should not use outdated terminology]{.underline} to describe a region
when it is no longer useful (MacFarlane & Sabanadze, 2013; Glanville,
2013). [It is not as though sovereignty has not already adapted and been
changed with other alterations]{.underline}. The [European
Union]{.underline}, for example, [does not fit within the traditional
bounds of sovereignty]{.underline}. It operates as somewhat of a
[hybrid]{.underline} that follows some [older rules]{.underline} but
also **[adapts to the type of sovereignty]{.underline}** [that the
European Union represents]{.underline}. The [Arctic]{.underline}
similarly [should be an opportunity]{.underline} [for
sovereignty]{.underline} to **[evolve and]{.underline}**
**[address]{.underline}** [both the changing role of
geography]{.underline} and [Indigenous peoples]{.underline} alongside a
[**new conception** of **shared sovereignty** as well as deal with the
**very real threat of climate change**.]{.underline}

### AT: Empathy/Solidarity/Universal Values/Etc Bad

#### The [premise]{.underline} that it is [possible]{.underline} and [desirable]{.underline} to formulate universal standards of right and wrong is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to both [coherent ethics]{.underline} and [effective politics]{.underline}.

**Ruti, 17**---Distinguished Professor of critical theory and of gender
and sexuality studies at the University of Toronto (Mari, "The Ethics of
Precarity: Judith Butler's Reluctant Universalism," *Remains of the
Social: Desiring the Postapartheid*, Chapter 4, pp. 106-113, dml)

I agree that self-assertion can take place at the expense of others. And
I agree that the fantasy of sovereignty can promote contempt not only
for others but also for alternative, more relational modalities of
being. But [I am **not convinced** that the subject who seeks to
recentre itself is **automatically sadistic** and
**cruel**]{.underline}, [driven to **annihilate** the
other]{.underline}. Indeed, looking back, [[one might ask whether
feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the [civil rights]{.mark}
movement]{.underline}, [[anticolonial struggles and resistance to
apartheid would have been **possible**]{.mark} if those involved had
decided that autonomy and self-determination are **inherently
malevolent**]{.underline}. Moreover, [I wonder whether such initiatives
would have been possible [without **a priori values**]{.mark} such as
**freedom** and **equality**]{.underline} -- values that arguably hark
back to the very Enlightenment that Butler tries so hard to bury.

Interestingly, Butler's resistance to a priori values, even ones derived
from the Enlightenment, dissipates in the context of her critique of
Israeli state violence against Palestinians, for she argues that
Palestinians have the right to basic rights, such as not to be
dispossessed of land, due to their membership in a global human
community. Regarding Palestine's claim 'to the lands that rightfully are
its own', Butler writes: 'One could formulate the right in light of
international law or on the basis of moral and political arguments that
may or may not be framed within a specific version of the nation-state'
(Parting Ways 205). I agree with this stance: I also think that
Palestinians should have basic human rights regardless of whether or not
they belong to a nation-state. Yet there is nothing about Butler's
Levinasian vision that supports her sudden turn to the kind of liberal
rights-based cosmopolitanism that can be traced, through Hannah Arendt,
all the way back to Immanuel Kant. If Butler stayed faithful to her
Levinasian approach, she would not be calling for equal rights for
Palestinians but rather saying that self-preservation should not be a
priority for them, that, indeed, there might be something profoundly
unethical about their quest for sovereignty and self-determination.
Butler makes a valiant effort to show that her cosmopolitanism is not
the same as that of Kant by arguing that it is precarity rather than the
integrity of the autonomous self that is the foundation for equal
rights. But this does not change the fact that, in this instance, she
falls back on the very system of Enlightenment morality that she has
spent much of her career criticising, so that all of a sudden equal
rights are all the rage. One could of course argue that the
Enlightenment does not own the ideal of equal rights, that it is
possible to think about equal rights beyond their humanistic context, as
Jacques Derrida does when he claims that 'what remains irreducible to
any deconstruction' is 'an idea of justice -- which we distinguish from
law or right and even from human rights -- and an idea of democracy --
which we distinguish from its current concept and from its determined
predicates today' (74). But Derrida's elusive definition of justice and
democracy is not what Butler is working with when she, in a Kantian
vein, calls for international laws that recognise the rights of
individuals not on the basis of their attachment to nation-states but
rather on the basis of their humanity.

It seems to me that Butler cannot have it both ways. If she is going to
recoil from any mention of the Enlightenment, as she consistently does,
then she cannot use its values whenever these happen to suit her
political purposes. Nor is it true that we can simply just discard a
priori normative limits. [There are situations where]{.underline} all of
our **[talk]{.underline}** about human precariousness **[will not get us
very far]{.underline}**, [where normative judgements are
**indispensable**]{.underline}. One of the limitations of posthumanist
[theory]{.underline} is that it [places so much emphasis on
deconstructing normativity that it tends to **forget** that while
there]{.underline} certainly [are normative limits we need to criticise
and transgress]{.underline}, [there are others we need to **endorse**
and **treasure**]{.underline}. As Dominick LaCapra explains with his
characteristic levelheadedness, [there are some]{.underline} normative
limits '[you might want to place in **question**]{.underline}, [some you
may want to **reform**]{.underline}, [and others you may want to **test
critically** and perhaps **validate**]{.underline}' (154). That is,
[[not all]{.mark} normative limits [are
**diabolical**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [there are [some]{.mark} that
[are]{.mark} **by far** the **best**]{.underline} ([or even [the
**only**]{.mark}]{.underline}) [[way to **check the abuses of
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There are times when we need [to **make
decisions** about right and wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} to
**[act accordingly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Whether we are talking about
a man aiming his gun at Norwegian youth, or about a dictator aiming his
genocidal rage at segments of his own population, [[we need
**universal**]{.mark}**ly applicable [principles]{.mark}**]{.underline}
-- normative limits -- [and the fact that we might never be able to
agree fully on their parameters **does not diminish** the urgency of our
desperate need for them]{.underline}.

[Nor is there any reason to reject a priori norms]{.underline}, as many
poststructuralist thinkers seem to do, [on the basis that they are
metaphysically founded]{.underline}, [for it is **perfectly possible**
to derive a set of a priori principles from provisional social
agreements]{.underline} -- agreements [[that remain open to]{.mark}
**constant re-evaluation** and **[revision]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
the feminist philosopher Amy Allen has argued persuasively, [a priori
norms are always historically specific in the sense that they arise in
particular social contexts]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, however,
[does not mean that they are **invariably worthless**]{.underline}; that
is, [the loss of metaphysical foundations for our normative systems does
not **automatically invalidate** them but merely reveals their
historicity]{.underline}. Any a priori set of principles, Allen
explains, is by definition 'our historical a priori', yet [rejecting
such principles wholesale]{.underline} '[would mean **surrendering
intelligibility**]{.underline}' (35).

VII Butler's resistance to normative limits explains, in part at least,
her conflicted attitude towards the universal implications of her ethics
of precarity. As I have emphasised, one of the strengths of this ethics
is that it offers a universally applicable ethical paradigm that is
grounded not in Enlightenment notions of sovereignty but rather in a
social ontology that foregrounds human relationality and vulnerability.
As we have seen, Butler explicitly acknowledges the universal reach of
her paradigm: [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} fact that precariousness is a
generalisable condition of human life. Yet her [[relationship]{.mark}
to]{.underline} this [universality [is
**ambivalent**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even
**[reluctant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, no doubt [[because]{.mark} it is
**difficult** to talk about universality in the context [of]{.mark}
ethics without raising [the]{.mark}]{.underline} very [spectres of
**Enlightenment rationality** and **Western imperialism**]{.underline}
that she is trying to outwit. This ambivalence is particularly manifest
in Parting Ways, where Butler performs an awkward retraction of her
earlier rhetoric of generalisability by claiming that her emphasis on
shared human precariousness is a matter of pluralisation rather than
universalisation. Under pluralisation, she writes, 'Equal protection or,
indeed, equality is not a principle that homogenizes those to whom it
applies; rather, the commitment to equality is a commitment to the
process of differentiation itself ' (126). Speaking of suffering
specifically, Butler adds that, unlike universalisation, pluralisation
recognises that even though all of us are defenceless against suffering,
any given experience of suffering is so unique that the attempt to
compare various forms of suffering is bound to founder. If, as I noted
at the beginning of this chapter, Butler's earlier work included a
sustained effort to navigate the tension between universality and
singularity, she now presents this tension as more or less
insurmountable: 'If we start with the presumption that one group's
suffering is like another group's, we have not only assembled the groups
into provisional monoliths -- and so falsified them -- but we have
launched into a form of analogy building that will invariably fail '
(128, emphases added).

Butler's ambivalence about using the trope of universalism in Parting
Ways is understandable, for in this text -- which includes the
aforementioned critique of Israeli state violence against Palestinians
-- she is walking a tightrope between arguing, on the one hand, that the
Jewish history of exile, violation and dispossession should yield
insight into the experiences of exile, violation and dispossession of
others, including the Palestinians, and insisting, on the other, that we
should not conflate these two experiences. In other words, however
critical Butler is of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians (and she
is very critical), she wants to make absolutely sure that she cannot be
accused of claiming that these policies are akin to Hitler's National
Socialism; she obviously does not want to imply that 'Zionism is like
Nazism or is its unconscious repetition with Palestinians standing in
for the Jews' (29). One can certainly understand why the context of her
discussion calls for repeated disclaimers about strict analogies, and
why it therefore complicates the discourse of generalisability that she
has used more freely in her earlier books. The rhetorical challenges of
Butler's analysis in this text are formidable because she does not want
to downplay the specificity of the Nazi genocide, yet she seeks to build
a model of political responsibility that would recognise convergent
modes of dispossession; she wishes to acknowledge that 'there are
historically specific modalities of catastrophe that cannot be measured
or compared by any common or neutral standard' (29), yet she also
strives to leap from one history of oppression to another. As she
maintains: 'In thinking about the history of the oppressed, it seems
imperative to recognize that such a history can and does apply to any
number of people in ways that are never strictly parallel and tend to
disrupt easy analogies' (100). Butler, in short, wishes to translate
divergent experiences of suffering into claims about justice without
thereby implying that the experiences in question are equivalent.

I understand why Butler insists that histories of dispossession can be
convergent without being equivalent. I agree with her resistance to the
kind of universalisation that erases important distinctions. And I would
never endorse an ethical model where one history of suffering would
negate another, where the specificity of suffering would be lost. Yet
[there is]{.underline} also [something]{.underline} [**unconvincing**
about Butler's]{.underline} sudden [attempt to **replace**
universalisation with pluralisation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
particularly about [her [claim that]{.mark}]{.underline}, [when it comes
to experiences of suffering]{.underline}, [[analogies]{.mark}
will]{.underline} '**[invariably [fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark}.
[[Given that the ability to draw analogies]{.mark} between different
forms of suffering [constitutes the]{.mark} **very [crux
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} her **[[ethics]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
precarity, [it is **difficult** to see how this ethics can **survive**
the collapse of this ability]{.underline}. If anything, it seems that
[[this]{.mark} collapse [would]{.mark} **instantly [undermine]{.mark}**
[the **most radical potential**]{.mark}]{.underline} of Butler's ethics,
namely [[its ability to **compete** with other universalising
paradigms]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as transcendental Enlightenment
ones]{.underline}. [Nor does]{.underline} Butler's [hesitation about
universalism seem **theoretically necessary**]{.underline}, [for drawing
an analogy **does not cancel out** the distinctiveness of the entities
being compared]{.underline}. As Butler herself postulates in Precarious
Life: 'When analogies are offered, they presuppose the separability of
the terms that are compared. But any analogy also assumes a common
ground for comparability, and in this case the analogy functions to a
certain degree by functioning metonymically' (72). Exactly. If I draw an
analogy by saying that you and I both have two eyes, this does not mean
that our eyes are therefore identical: my eyes will still be blue while
yours will still be brown. But what is important is the understanding
that if someone throws acid in our eyes, we will both scream. Likewise,
[if I say that bodily vulnerability is something that you and I
**share**]{.underline}, [I do not mean to suggest that we experience
this vulnerability in the **same way**]{.underline}.

[A universalist ethics]{.underline} of precarity [does not demand a
**similarity** of experiences but merely that we are able]{.underline}
to recognise [**points of contact** between different
experiences]{.underline}. Let us recall that [even the most banal forms
of universalism]{.underline}, such as the liberal rhetoric of 'different
but equal', [do not ask that we all have the same experiences but merely
that]{.underline} -- as human beings -- [we possess the capacity to
**recognise the correspondences**]{.underline}, the often quite abstract
resemblances, [between different experiences]{.underline}. When it comes
to suffering, for instance, [universalism does not presume that my
suffering is like yours but merely that I am able to **draw a
parallel**]{.underline} between your suffering and mine. In
[this]{.underline} sense, Butler's [fear that universalisation is
**intrinsically homogenising** seems]{.underline} somewhat
**[misplaced]{.underline}**, and in fact directly contradicts her own
statements elsewhere in Parting Ways, such as the following: 'It is only
possible to struggle to alleviate the suffering of others if I am both
motivated and dispossessed by my own suffering' (127). Likewise, Butler
explicitly posits that one history of suffering provides 'the conditions
of attunement to another such history', so that 'one finds the condition
of one's own life in the life of another where there is dependency and
differentiation, proximity and violence' (130). I have already expressed
my reservations about the idea that ethics should be based on something
as unreliable as my capacity to be moved by the suffering of others. But
[if]{.underline} such an [ethics is going to **work at
all**]{.underline}, [[we must **presuppose**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
the common experience of precariousness provides [[a grounds
for]{.underline}]{.mark} translating from one experience to another in
ways that open to a degree of
**[[universalization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [that though each human
life is unique]{.underline}, [there is a kernel of sameness [that
makes]{.mark} **identification**]{.underline} ([and therefore
**[ethical]{.mark} indignation**]{.underline}, [[**outrage** and
**action**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[possible]{.underline}]{.mark}.

VIII\. This attempt to sort out the relationship between the universal
and the particular, the generalisable and the singular, the potentially
equivalent and the unique, surfaces strongly in the context of the
concept of global apartheid that the editors of this volume foreground
in their introduction. Like the relationship between Israel and
Palestine on which Butler focuses, South African apartheid is one of the
sorest spots in recent world history, frequently discussed with an
emphasis on its exceptionality. Can it, then, be raised to an emblem of
racism, inequality, suffering and poverty outside its original context?
Can analogies be drawn between its oppressions and more global
oppressions without losing the distinctiveness of the South African
experience? Achille Mbembe seems to believe so when he remarks that the
student protests that have recently rocked South African campuses 'can
be felt afar, in a different idiom, in those territories of abandonment
where the violence of poverty and demoralization have become the norm'.
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri suggest the same when they assert, in
Multitude, that in 'the global Empire today, as it was before in South
Africa, apartheid is a productive system of hierarchical inclusion that
perpetuates the wealth of the few through the labor and poverty of the
many' (166--167).

The volume editors find much that is productive about such attempts to
draw comparisons, not least because they recognise that [insisting
on]{.underline} the **[[specificity]{.underline}]{.mark}** of South
African apartheid [[makes it]{.mark} **all [too easy]{.mark}** for
Western powers [to **disavow oppression**]{.mark} on their own
doorstep]{.underline}, [to insist that systematic segregation is **not a
problem**]{.underline} '**[over here]{.underline}**' -- say, [in
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates --
[in the same way as it is]{.underline} '**[over there]{.underline}**'.
[[The]{.mark} emphasis on]{.underline} **[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}**
apartheid [[is **effective** in rendering this]{.mark} type of disavowal
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, the editors
point to an important pitfall in drawing the analogy between South
Africa and global apartheid too carelessly, namely that this can enable
the global West to use South Africa as a screen upon which to project
its optimistic fantasy that since apartheid was dismantled in South
Africa, it can also be easily dismantled globally. The editors note that
such a fantasy is particularly pernicious in light of the fact that the
end of South African apartheid coincided 'with South Africa's entry into
the neoliberal order of global capitalism' (15). Even though this state
of affairs merely rearticulates some of the very pillars of inequality
upon which apartheid was built, it is expedient for supporters of
neoliberalism who wish to promote global capitalism as an antidote to
the world's problems, including the problems of 'global apartheid'. This
is why the editors reject the kind of facile globalisation of apartheid
that allows the West to engage in hypocritical gestures of self-critique
without actually doing anything to alleviate global inequalities.
Instead, the editors advance a concept of global apartheid that
acknowledges that apartheid 'stretched back to the dawn of modernity and
to the beginning of European colonialism'. In other words, if it is
convenient for Western powers to think of apartheid as a malaise that
started in South Africa and has now somehow suddenly spread to the rest
of the world, the editors ask us to admit that global apartheid reaches
back at least as far as René Descartes and 'the division, the
separateness, the apartness, of mind and body, and the subjection of
body to mind that he inaugurates' (18).

### AT: Nation-States Obsolete

#### Nation-states [inevitable]{.underline}.

**Malešević, 23**---Full Professor and Chair of Sociology at the
University College, Dublin (Siniša, "The Many Faces of Nationalism,"
Nationalities Papers, First View, doi:10.1017/nps.2022.114, dml)

Only [**twenty years** ago]{.underline}, many scholars interpreted
nationalism as an ideology experiencing gradual and inevitable decline.
Social and political [theorists]{.underline} from Ulrich Beck and
Anthony Giddens to David Held and Zygmunt Bauman [were **adamant** that
globalization had **dissolved** the borders of nation-states and
that]{.underline} "old style [nationalism]{.underline}" [had become
**obsolete**]{.underline} (Giddens Reference Giddens2002, 18). Even as
an astute thinker as Hartmut Rosa (Reference Rosa2013, 203--4) could not
escape this type of reasoning, as he wrote about the ever increasing
"denationalization" of societies and the "loss of the national state's
function in the age of globalization." Today, the focus has shifted in
the opposite direction and many scholars speak about the resurgence,
revival, return, renewal, or re-emergence of nationalism (Tamir
Reference Tamir2019; Hazony Reference Hazony2018; Judis Reference
Judis2018). For example, Tamir (Reference Tamir2019, 3) writes how "the
reemergence of nationalism has taken the world by surprise" while Hazony
(Reference Hazony2018) points to the "return to nationalism" that is
exemplified by "the British vote for independence and a nationalist
revival in the United States." The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has
further intensified this view of nationalism's "re-emergence."

However, there is nothing new to these types of pronouncements, as
[intellectuals have been **writing off** nationalism since its inception
and have]{.underline} then [just as often been]{.underline} [**regularly
surprised** by its]{.underline} "sudden" and "unexpected"
[periodic]{.underline} "**[revival]{.underline}**." From Rosa Luxemburg
and Karl Popper to Friedrich Hayek, political [[theorists]{.mark} have
**habitually [dismissed]{.mark}** [nationalism as]{.mark} a temporary
anomaly [bound to disappear]{.mark} soon]{.underline} (Malešević
Reference Malešević2019, 1--5). As [this **does not
happen**]{.underline}, many intellectuals express astonishment every
time nationalism becomes highly visible in public discourses. Hence the
focus usually shifts towards finding the immediate causes of something
that is in fact a longue durée phenomenon and, as such, requires
structural and historical explanations.

The classical scholarship on nationalism demonstrated a long time ago
that [[such]{.mark} dismissive proclamations [have **no foundation in
historical reality**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gellner Reference
Gellner1983; Anderson Reference Anderson1983; Smith Reference
Smith1986). Nationalism developed quite late as a sociological
phenomenon, but [once it took hold of state power its growth was
**largely continuous**]{.underline}. [[Nationalist doctrine]{.mark} has
managed to [**replace** competing ideological discourses]{.mark} of
state legitimacy]{.underline}, [including the divine origins of
monarchs]{.underline}, [imperial creeds]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} notion of a [civilizing mission]{.underline}, among
many others. From the end of WWII, [nationalism has gradually attained
many **hegemonic features** [and has become]{.mark} the
**[dominant]{.mark} form** of political legitimacy]{.underline} in the
contemporary world. [In addition to **acquiring state power** and
**enveloping official institutions** and **non-state
organizations**]{.underline}, [this ideology and social practice has
**penetrated civil society** and]{.underline} the inter-personal
networks of **[everyday life]{.underline}**. The
[scholarship]{.underline} on everyday nationalism [clearly indicates how
**embedded** nation-centric thinking is]{.underline} our daily practices
(Fox and Iddriss, Reference Fox and Miller-Idriss2008, Skey and
Antonsich Reference Skey and Antonsich2018, Knott Reference Knott2016).
Hence [[nationalism **never** experienced a significant
decline]{.underline}]{.mark}. Instead, [over [the last **two hundred
years**]{.mark} one could [witness an **incessant
proliferation**]{.mark} of nationalism across the globe and within
different social strata]{.underline} of individual societies. As I have
argued before, [the historical trajectory of nationalism has been
[shaped by **nearly continuous**]{.mark}]{.underline} organizational,
ideological, and micro-interactional [[grounding]{.mark} **across** time
and space]{.underline} (Malešević Reference Malešević, Höhne and
Meireis2020, Reference Malešević2019, Reference Malešević2013). [The
**relative [invisibility]{.mark}** of this grounding]{.underline} and
the lack of aggressive language in the public discourse [have
[prevented]{.mark} many]{.underline} commentators [from **adequately
[assessing]{.mark}** [the actual strength]{.mark} of nationalist
penetration in everyday life]{.underline}. Thus, as [nationalism **never
went away**]{.underline}, [**nor** it was in **decline**]{.underline},
it could not experience a "re-emergence" or "return." [The recent
proliferation of aggressive nationalist discourses does not indicate
its]{.underline} "**[revival]{.underline}**," [it only makes ongoing
nationalist practices **more visible**]{.underline} in the public space.
In this sense, nationalism resembles the proverbial iceberg: many pay
attention to its tip when there is a threat of direct collision, even
though the iceberg has been there before and much of it remains
invisible to the human eye.

One of the reasons why intellectuals tend to regularly downplay the
significance of [[nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is that this
phenomenon [has **many faces**]{.underline}. Nationalism has protean
features [that]{.underline}, like a chameleon, [[can]{.mark} **easily
[adapt]{.mark}** to its surroundings]{.underline}. Scholars have
traditionally invoked the image of the Roman god Janus to pinpoint the
two contradictory faces of nationalism - as a force of collective
solidarity, but also as a mechanism of group aggression against those
that do not belong to the nation (Nairn Reference Nairn2005). However
nationalism has many faces -- [[it is]{.mark} a
**[multifaceted]{.mark}** political ideology]{.underline}, [a **habitual
form** of everyday practice]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} a **very
plastic** type of modern subjectivity]{.underline}.

[Nationalism is]{.underline} a **[flexible]{.underline}** discourse
[and]{.underline} social practice that [can coalesce with far right and
far left ideologies but [can]{.mark} also [accommodate]{.mark} moderate
[positions **across the**]{.mark} **political
[spectrum]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nationalist ideas are the cornerstone
of such ideologically diverse movements as the far right Reconquete! in
France and Finns Party in Finland, and far-left groups such as the
Catalan Candidatura d'Unitat Popular or the United Socialist Party of
Venezuela. Similarly nationalist principles feature prominently in
center right parties such as the Conservatives in the UK, Forza Italia,
or the Croatian Democratic Union, and in the center left parties, such
as Scottish National Party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party, or the Danish
Social Democrats.

Even more importantly, [nationalism is not just a **political
ideology**]{.underline}, [[it is]{.mark} also [a **social
practice**]{.mark} that is [**integral** to]{.mark} many activities and
processes present in a **variety** of social organizations and outlets
of everyday life]{.underline}. For example, [nationalist practices are
often promoted by **religious organizations**]{.underline} (i.e. Serbian
Orthodox Church, evangelical Christian movements in the US, or the
Jewish Home organization in Israel.) Nationalist ideas can also underpin
**[civil society activities]{.underline}** (from ethnic minority NGOs
and cultural heritage associations, to national sport societies such as
the GAA in Ireland and Basque pelota clubs), **[private
corporations]{.underline}** (from selling distinct national products
such as BMW and Guinness, to promoting national tourist destinations
such as the Taj Mahal or Hagia Sophia), [and different **social
institutions**]{.underline} (such as masonic lodges, veterans'
associations, or even nursing homes.)

[Nation-centric practices are also **integral** to [everyday life and
habitual interactions]{.mark}]{.underline} between friends, family
members, neighbors, peers, and clan and kinship-based groups. For
example, wedding celebrations in the Balkans are often accompanied by
patriotic songs and the waving of national flags, while in Denmark
birthday parties regularly feature Danish national symbols, such as the
Danneborg. The intimacy of friendship is also often interwoven with the
shared experience of fervent cheering for one's national teams in
various sporting competitions. In this sense, [nationalism has become a
meta-ideological doctrine and social practice that
**infuses**]{.underline} many aspects of [everyday life]{.underline} in
the contemporary world. Hence to better understand this complex
phenomenon, it is necessary to explore these many faces of nationalism.

### Contingency---2AC

#### Racism's [contingent]{.underline}, not [structural]{.underline}.

**al-Gharbi, 24**---assistant professor in the School of Communication
and Journalism at Stony Brook University (Musa, "Mystification of Social
Processes," *We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a
New Elite*, Chapter 6, pp. 284-286, dml)

Moreover, [the]{.underline} largely [abstract [focus on]{.mark} social
[structure]{.mark} **conveniently [elides]{.mark}** considerations of
individual [agency]{.mark}]{.underline}. In truth, structure and agency
are deeply intertwined: as a result of social structure, [we all make
decisions under constraint]{.underline}. [Some have many more
constraints than others]{.underline}---particularly those who have
little financial or symbolic capital. The flip side, however, is that
[others have far more agency than everyone else]{.underline}, and their
decisions or behaviors often exert a disproportionate impact on the
possibilities available to others. Symbolic capitalists, again, must be
counted among this latter group. We are in a much stronger position than
most to influence the prevailing order. We often exercise our agency in
pernicious ways when we could do other wise. [Evoking]{.underline} "[the
system]{.underline}" [is often a way of **obscuring** this
fact]{.underline}. [By claiming to be **mere cogs** in the
machine]{.underline}, [**helplessly bound** by the prevailing
order]{.underline} just like everyone else, contemporary [elites
**implicitly absolve** themselves of any unique responsibility for
social problems]{.underline} ([or any unique obligation to make
sacrifices or changes to address those problems]{.underline}).

In a similar fashion, [[many]{.underline}]{.mark} contemporary symbolic
capitalists [[evoke]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[as]{.mark} a chief [cause]{.mark}
of contemporary injustices]{.underline}. [However]{.underline},
"**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[[doesn't do
anything]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The tendency]{.underline} of many
symbolic capitalists [to analyze contemporary injustices in historical
terms]{.underline} often [**obscures** how and why certain elements of
the past continue into the present]{.underline}. Discussing the
persistence of race ideology, historian Barbara Fields explained,
"[[Nothing]{.mark} handed down [from the past could keep race alive if
we did not **constantly reinvent**]{.mark} and **re-ritualize**
[it]{.mark} to fit our own terrain]{.underline}. If race lives on today,
it can do so only because we continue to create and re-create it in our
social life, continue to verify it, and thus continue to need a social
vocabulary that will allow us to make sense, not of what our ancestors
did then, but of what we ourselves choose to do now."49

[[Present-day]{.mark} racial [inequalities are **not some inevitable
by-product** of]{.mark}]{.underline} America's history of
[[slavery]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Jim Crow]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
so on]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[[reflections of people **today**]{.underline},]{.mark} here and now,
[taking actions that systematically favor certain people over
others]{.underline}. [Consider racialized differences in **home
appraisals**]{.underline}: studies consistently find that real estate
agents value the same home much differently depending on the race of the
seller.50 [This tendency is not a mere product of]{.underline}
"**[history]{.underline}**." In fact, far from being a holdover of the
past, [racial gaps in property appraisal have **grown
dramatically**]{.underline} since the 1980s.51 Large cities across the
United States were more segregated in 2019 than they were in 1990.52
Obviously, [these recent trends are **not**]{.underline} going to be
[**well explained** by appeals to slavery]{.underline}, [Jim
Crow]{.underline}, [historical redlining]{.underline}, [and so
forth]{.underline}. [The growing gaps are instead **overwhelmingly** a
function of **contemporary practices**]{.underline}. [Although appeals
to]{.underline} America's racist and sexist [history are often portrayed
as some kind of **critique** of the social order]{.underline}, instead
[they often serve as an **alibi**]{.underline}: it's not we who are to
blame, but those terrible people in the past (who are all conve niently
dead and therefore unable to be held to account).

"Historical," "[structural]{.underline}," "systemic," or "institutional"
[narratives]{.underline} also tend to [present an **overly mechanical**
and **deterministic** picture of the world]{.underline}. In truth,
[[events are]{.mark} often **[quite contingent]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Societies and institutions are]{.mark} **highly
[dynamic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As sociologist Andrew Abbott
emphasized, it is actually a much harder puzzle to explain continuity
than change.53 [[Change]{.underline}]{.mark} happens all the time. It
[[is **literally inevitable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[People cycle in
and out of institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [geographic
[areas]{.mark}]{.underline}, [relationships]{.underline}, [[and
life]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}. [[Individuals learn and
grow]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The physical environment is constantly
evolving]{.underline}. [New [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline},
[practices]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies [are
constantly]{.mark} being [developed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Resources
are]{.mark} constantly being extracted]{.underline},
[transformed]{.underline}, [and [shifted around]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Money is constantly changing hands]{.underline}. [[Actors
external]{.mark} to a particular society]{.underline} or institution
[are constantly attempting to [shape the world]{.mark} in the service of
their own ends]{.underline}, [influencing the possibilities and
incentives for others]{.underline}. [Structural]{.underline} or cultural
[persistence]{.underline} in the face of this constant churn and,
especially, [across generations and cultural contexts doesn't
just]{.underline} "**[happen]{.underline}**." It's an accomplishment.

[When we analyze how systems and institutions operate in **concrete**
terms]{.underline} rather than just waving our hands at "the system,"
"history," or related abstractions, [we can see that inequalities within
institutions tend to be produced and sustained by **everyday practices**
in **local contexts** rather than by forces outside one's
control]{.underline}.54 Likewise, [it is in discrete behaviors and
interactions among actual people in concrete places at particular points
in time that abstractions]{.underline} like "race" or "gender" or
"class" or "sexuality" [express themselves]{.underline} "in the world."
[To the extent that the [macro forces]{.mark} and abstract
notions]{.underline} that sociologists focus on **[[exist]{.mark} at
all]{.underline}**, [it is [**only** through people enacting them in
**local contexts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.55 And [agents typically have
**many degrees of freedom** with]{.underline} respect to [if and how
they enact a social order]{.underline}. However, [[**cosmetically
radical** narratives about]{.underline}]{.mark} "systems,"
"**[[structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**," and "history" [are often
mobilized by symbolic capitalists to **[absolve]{.mark}** us of
[responsibility]{.mark} for the choices we make]{.underline}---
[[through]{.mark} **hyperbolically [deterministic]{.mark}**
[narratives]{.mark}]{.underline} on the one hand, [[and]{.mark} **unduly
[pessimistic]{.mark}** [analyses]{.mark}]{.underline} on the other.

[According to some]{.underline} prominent accounts, [America is
**fundamentally racist**]{.underline}, [and it **always has
been**]{.underline}. "**[Progress]{.underline}**" [has been]{.underline}
largely **[mythological]{.underline}**. [Injustices are **so deeply
entrenched** and **pervasive** that nothing short of **revolution** can
rectify the situation]{.underline}. [Smaller ameliorative measures may
even be **counterproductive**]{.underline} insofar as they make a bad
situation more tolerable, thereby forestalling the dramatic change that
needs to happen.56 However, revolution does not seem to be on the
horizon in the foreseeable future, nor is there an obvious path from the
current status quo to a (leftist) revolution. Hence, it seems as though
the only thing that the clear-eyed can do is carry on as usual (albeit
with occasional pangs of guilt) and regularly condemn the system we
profit from even as we continue to actively exploit it. [Arguments like
[these are **superficially radical** yet **functionally
conservative**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They [allow adherents to **feel
self-righteous**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
[present]{.mark} themselves [as]{.mark} deeply [committed to]{.mark}
substantial [change]{.mark}]{.underline} ([especially as [compared with
those focused on]{.mark} incremental]{.underline} and piecemeal
[[reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}, whom they often mock), [[while
**neutralizing any**]{.mark} **apparent [obligation to do
anything]{.mark}**]{.underline} (beyond saying, thinking, or feeling the
"right" things). [Although]{.underline} the people advancing these
[arguments]{.underline} often [evoke]{.underline}
"**[systems]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline}
"**[structures]{.underline}**," precisely what [their [pessimism]{.mark}
allows them to **[avoid]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [any **hard
[thinking]{.mark}** [about concrete changes]{.mark} that could be made
to the system in order [to **ameliorate**]{.mark} social
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[let alone working through **specific
processes**]{.underline},]{.mark} mechanisms, [and]{.underline}
consensus-building [**campaigns** [that]{.mark} would [allow]{.mark}
these [changes to be]{.mark} successfully
[implemented]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, [precisely what these
pessimists are not doing is thinking in **genuinely systemic** or
**structural** terms]{.underline}.

### Fiat Good---Freedom Dreaming---2AC

#### Fiat is [freedom dreaming]{.underline}. The optimistic imagination of role-played scenarios of policy change is [more empowering]{.underline} than negativistic [critique]{.underline}.

**Fernández, et al, 24**---Ethnic Studies Department, College of Arts &
Sciences, Santa Clara University (Jesica Siham, with Rashida Govan, Ben
Kirshner, Tafadzwa Tivaringe, and Roderick Watts, "Youth Community
Organizing Groups Fostering Sociopolitical Wellbeing: Three
Healing-Oriented Values to Support Activism," Youth 2024, 4(3),
1004-1025, dml)

[Freedom is anchored in the cultivation of **hope** and people
exercising their freedom to challenge oppression]{.underline}. [To
**envision possibilities** for freedom is to acknowledge and affirm that
change is **possible** and that both hope and action must go **hand in
hand**]{.underline} to make just change a reality. [[**Imagining**
and]{.mark} therefore [**working** to create a future where all]{.mark}
people [can heal and thrive **beyond mere
survival**]{.mark}]{.underline} characterizes the third healing-oriented
value, which [[is **freedom dreaming**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Robin D. G.
Kelley \[65\] describes "freedom dreaming" as [**[imagining
alternatives]{.mark}** to oppressive conditions]{.underline} of
inequity, violence, and trauma. Freedom dreaming [[can help youth
harness their skills]{.underline}]{.mark}, [capacities]{.underline},
[and tools to move [toward **actualizing** change]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[66\]. [To support political action]{.underline}, [young organizers
must practice **envisioning** the future and **reimaging** the
present]{.underline}. For example, asking young organizers to reconsider
what a school environment without police and policing could be; instead
of having police or security officers in schools, they have access to
counselors, mentors, and healing-centered practitioners. Asking youth to
question the way things are is in alignment with freedom dreaming.

[Political action]{.underline} within YCO settings [was **most
sustained** when [freedom dreaming]{.mark} was a part of their
organizing strategies]{.underline}. For example, young organizers
described their motivations for joining a campaign, as the following
excerpts from EE and PJU illustrate:

Well, my participation with EE is helping me pursue my dreams. It makes
me pursue my dreams in a way that EE is fighting for equal education.
... For example, if I don't have enough money to go to university, they
say: "You can talk to us. What can we do for you to go to university?"

---EE, Interview

At a PJU "accountability meeting" with the school district, youth
participated by introducing themselves using the same general phrase:
"My name is \[name\], I'm in \[grade in school\], and I'm pre-college.
Not pre-prison!"

---PJU, Fieldnote

[The process of transformation often [**begins**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} asking for help or seeking resources to pursue
one's dream, as well as changing or challenging the dominant, often
oppressive scripts. This is consistent with Gutiérrez's \[67\] notion of
"social dreaming", or [**[engineering social design
experiments]{.mark}** with alternatives]{.underline} \[68\]. In other
words, [it relates to holding dreams for a **collective** or on behalf
of a broader set of social others]{.underline}, a community, or a group
of people. These personal dreams are fundamental to fostering collective
dreams. Within YCO, young organizers are encouraged to dream as
individuals, and then supported in seeing these individual dreams as
threaded together toward the collective dreams, which is in line with
Kelley's \[65\] process of imagining alternatives. Freedom dreaming
therefore involves questioning and addressing the inequities within
people's environments, their own lives and relationships, or the
settings and contexts wherein communities are situated. [[**Collectively
visualizing** a campaign victory]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[**strategizing** how to make that possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
**identifying**]{.mark} who the [power players]{.mark} are]{.underline}
what stories, testimonies, and actions [[will be **most
compelling**]{.mark} to leverage change]{.underline} are all elements of
freedom dreaming in practice.

As a healing-oriented value, freedom dreaming is oriented toward
transformation instead of repair or reform. In this regard, communities
impacted by inequities are involved in re-imagining and enacting change
as they wish to see it in their lives. For example, reconsidering the
culture of schooling to be more affirming of students' experiential
knowledge and seeing students and their communities flourishing are
examples of freedom dreaming that many young organizers voiced. The
following interview quotes by two young organizers with Coleman
Advocates demonstrate this point:

We've been trying to speak and get people angry about stuff. I feel like
anger is the fire to start it all up to make them passionate about
something. Because if they're not passionate about something, then it'll
just---like, the flame will just burn out, right? But if you're really,
if you're heated and you're like, "Wow, that's an injustice! This is
happening. Wow! I can't believe that. I want to make this change,
because I don't want to see my children go through this. I don't want to
see the next generation go through this. I'm tired of going through
this, myself." I think that's where it all starts, so yeah.

---Coleman Advocates, Interview

I guess that little spark could just explode into being something
awesome. You know, like a little bud blooming into becoming a flower.
Probably doing rallies at schools and---just spreading the word
throughout the city and getting youth organized would probably increase
the numbers of people coming to \[Coleman Advocates\], yeah. And
probably not just having YMAC \[Youth Making a Change, Coleman
Advocates\] based here, like, after school---probably have more offices
around the city or the school even, you know? Have them have their own
classroom at every school in the San Francisco Unified School District.

---Coleman Advocates, Interview

Young organizers' [dreams are **not naïve** or **utopic**]{.underline}
by any means. Instead, [their dreams are anchored in their
**experiences**]{.underline} as young organizers who firmly believe they
deserve better; they deserve equity, freedom, dignity, and liberation.
[[These dreams are **possible** to actualize if people in]{.mark}
positions of [power were activated to **care for** or
**recognize**]{.mark} the root causes of the
[inequities]{.mark}]{.underline}, which YCO supports [[through]{.mark}
**sustained [political action]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Freedom dreaming, consistent with spiritual activism, is about building
a critical consciousness to take the necessary actions toward change.
Reflecting on the words of poet Jayne Cortez, "somewhere in advance of
nowhere", Kelly purports, "[[Without **new visions**]{.underline}, [we
don't know what to **build**]{.underline}, [only what to **knock
down**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We]{.mark} not only [end up
**confused**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
**[rudderless]{.underline}**[, [and **cynical**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of **clever
maneuvers** and **tactics** but a **process** that can and must
transform us]{.underline}" \[65\] (preface xii). [[Political
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, [when approached through the
**healing-oriented value** of freedom dreaming]{.underline}, [[can
help]{.mark} young [organizers develop]{.mark} a **deep
[understanding]{.mark}** [of the mechanisms of power]{.mark} and
oppression as well as their sociopolitical wellbeing [to **sustain
themselves**]{.mark} emotionally]{.underline}, [mentally]{.underline},
[and even physically in their organizing]{.underline}, as one young
organizer notes in their interview:

Well, I think I've never been a very tolerant person. Every time someone
comes to me with a problem, I'm able to sit down and listen, even though
I'll cry, (I think that some of them think I'm a very emotional person).
Now I'm able to listen to people and give advice that they use, because
some of them would report back that, "You know what, I've used---I've
taken your advice on what you said the other day, and the result of that
came out to be like this." \[...\] Yeah, I can now analyze stuff and
listen because I've been equipped---I'm more tolerant. I think, again,
the scenario at our school of not having teachers, I was then, at the
time, forced, because we didn't want to be radical about this whole
issue of forcing the government to bring back our teachers. Then I was
forced to think of the things that I want to see happen to me and my
peers if we don't have teachers and then we are happy about that. At
first, I didn't take this seriously, that we don't have teachers. It was
fine at first. Then, I realized that I came to school to study. Now, if
there are no teachers at school, then why am I coming to school? That
was, in some way, negative, because it was going to go on and go on and
go on, and then maybe I would end up saying, "I will not go to school."

---EE, Interview

[[Understanding]{.mark} oppression]{.underline}, much like dreaming
alone, [[is **not enough**]{.mark} to bring about change]{.underline},
[which is **needed** for healing]{.underline}. Both a [[critical
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} of root causes [[must be
facilitated]{.mark} **alongside** the avenues to **engage actions** that
can allow for dreams to **take shape** in the real world]{.underline}.

YCO created a range of [activities]{.underline} that [contributed to
young organizers' freedom to dream [by]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, [[**role-playing different scenarios** of]{.mark} how they
would express their needs and demands in front of leaders]{.underline}.
Through reflections, discussions, trainings, and workshops, as well as
skits, reading circles, and artistic expression, [youth **cultivated
their envisioning** of [what **political actions**]{.mark} they would
engage and what [they desired to see
**actualized**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The following demonstrates these
moments among young organizers at EE:

Well, the only message that I would like to get across, is the fact that
[[when one **puts oneself in the shoes** of the other and **feels the
pain**]{.mark} that others are going through and is able to
help]{.underline}, I think it is the uniqueness of one's journey [[that
gives one]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} to contribute so
much]{.underline}. ... Because at the end of the day South Africa will
not perish. It will have leaders. It will have people who are willing to
do this \[organizing\]. It will have lawyers. It will have people who
have confidence in themselves because of these youth programs. You find
that 80 percent---okay, you find that maybe, 60 percent of the learners
in schools do not want to hold themselves in such programs. I don't know
why they feel like that, but they just don't want them. You find that
those who involve themselves in such \[YCO\] programs, find it easier to
think outside of the box. They have confidence and they are go-getters.
They're willing to fight for what they want. ... Equal Education is
grooming us to be leaders. It's grooming us to be people who have
knowledge. If you lack knowledge, you perish.

---EE, Interview

Young organizers learned about topics relevant to their everyday lives
for the purpose of asking questions about them, crafting solutions, and
taking action to see those solutions realized. Such opportunities were
often facilitated through activities to help young organizers envision
what is possible when change happens. [Activities that fostered their
imagination were **valuable moments** for learning in **community** with
others]{.underline}. At times, [the activities]{.underline} included
youth engaging difficult emotions, such as anger, nervousness, and
vulnerability, as well as courage, joy, and hope.

Young organizers saw the relevance of their activities to their lives
and those of their peers, and this helped frame their campaigning
strategies. The relevance of the issues in youth lives [motivated them
to **continue** their actions and organizing]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark}
also [helped]{.mark} them [foster **radical hope** and persistence to
**remain engaged**]{.mark} in political action in a way that was
**sustainable** to their wellbeing]{.underline}, as the dialogue among
young organizers at Coleman Advocates demonstrates:

Each youth was seated around the couches, and each one responded by
stating their name and their response to the prompt. Among some of the
responses were: organizing for a "better future," "for change," "to be a
leader," to "show \[others\] we can be somebody," "struggle for change,"
turning "anger into action." One young organizer talked about organizing
as an outlet, that she was tired of getting angry and started to
organize as a way to get that anger out and channeling it into to action
to make something happen. Additional responses included organizing to
address: "oppression," "change inequalities," "taking action instead of
waiting around to see things happen," "family" \[...\] "wanting to make
a change," and "the government isn't gonna care \[for us/people\]." Once
some of these responses were gathered, Tina transitioned into the
icebreaker and mentioned that some of the reasons for why we organized
are tied to who we are and the lives we live "struggles we go through."
And another young organizer added "the next best thing to freedom is a
struggle for justice."

---Coleman Advocates, Fieldnote

As this fieldnote demonstrates, young organizers' agency and voice were
fostered through activities that called them to reflect on why they
organize as well as what their hopes or dreams are. Furthermore, the
range of learning and leadership roles young organizers often took on
within YCO settings supported their development as spiritual activists
and freedom dreamers. YCO settings provided supportive and collaborative
environments where healing-oriented values of collectivized care,
spiritual activism, and freedom dreaming were possible.

[Freedom dreaming as a healing-oriented value that young organizers
develop]{.underline} within YCO settings [has **long been put into
practice** by communities of color or people who are impacted by
systemic inequities]{.underline}. [**Abolitionists** who lead
emancipatory struggles and **civil rights** efforts]{.underline}, for
example, [engaged in freedom dreaming]{.underline} as part of their
movement \[69,70\]. [Youth and women of color on the
frontlines]{.underline} of these efforts [were]{.underline} perhaps
[fueled by an **[unwavering radical hope]{.mark}** for liberation for
themselves and future generations]{.underline}. [Forward
thinking]{.underline}, [anchored in a recognition of the present
struggle with a critical reflexive understanding of the
past]{.underline}, [[enables]{.underline}]{.mark} people to bridge
healing with political action. In this way, it describes what Miller and
Powers' \[71\] note as [the **[restoring of
wellbeing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [whereby the activation of a just
future fosters a **meaning** or **purpose** in life in relationship with
others who share that dream]{.underline}. The anticipation of a just,
free, and liberatory life suggests that [healing happens when hope in
action is activated and supported]{.underline}.

[Recent scholarship purports that developing a **radical vision** of
possibilities is **necessary** for restoring individual and community
wellbeing]{.underline} \[72\]. Relatedly, [[having a **practical
vision**]{.mark} of possibilities can help]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} it [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[**increase
collective action** among communities of color]{.underline}]{.mark}. To
support the political action of youth, Ginwright \[25,27,73\] asserts
that settings must align their values or practices with healing.
Furthermore, issues of power, history, identity, culture, and collective
memory must be integrated into settings where learning, health, and
wellness can and must be fostered. [Freedom dreaming
involves]{.underline} looking back and forward while [attending to the
urgencies of **redressing** systems of power and oppression that produce
inequities in the present and infusing political action with radical
hope]{.underline}. As Kelley \[65\] describes, [freedom dreaming
is]{.underline} "[**making visible** a new society]{.underline}, a
peaceful, cooperative, loving world without poverty and oppression" (p.
196), one that is unbounded and limitless to imagination.

6\. Conclusions

YCO supports political action among young organizers by providing them
with opportunities to develop, experience, engage, and practice values
associated with wellbeing. We describe these as healing-oriented values
of collective care, spiritual activism, and [freedom
dreaming]{.underline}. We demonstrate how these values provided young
organizers with meaningful moments for reflection on their concerns and
needs, alongside opportunities [for political action]{.underline}. The
facilitated opportunities for shared reflection, dialogue, and action
within YCO [can help cultivate]{.underline} young organizers' leadership
and [capacities for **sustained sociopolitical wellbeing**]{.underline}.
The three healing-oriented values we illustrated via our data show how
YCO practices can support youth sociopolitical wellbeing in relation to
[political action for liberation]{.underline}. We believe that the
pursuit of liberation is, or [can be]{.underline}, in and of itself, [a
pathway toward **healing**]{.underline}. Justice-centered work is
founded upon building a better world for ourselves, others, and those to
come, as well as the environment---a point that Kendall's vignette made
clear and several other organizers also expressed. In effect, Kendall
underscores the importance of belonging, specifically of [building
**solidarity** and connecting with others for the **greater
good**]{.underline}. In turn, this experience, or interconnected
practices of collective care, spiritual activism, and freedom dreaming,
[held implications for]{.underline} their [developing sociopolitical
wellbeing and]{.underline} ongoing process of [healing]{.underline}.

Personal and collective wellbeing for youth can be fostered through
varied activities and sources of support. Participation in YCO, however,
is not to be understood as a substitute for forms of mental health
support, such as therapy or medication, which may be right for a youth
in need of resources. What the examples from our study show is how
[organizing can be a **support** for]{.underline} young organizers'
[wellbeing]{.underline}, specifically [by exercising **agency** to
address institutional and systemic harms]{.underline}. In providing
opportunities for experiencing and enacting collectivized care,
spiritual activism, and [freedom dreaming]{.underline}, YCO [settings
became important spaces to build **learning communities** for the
development of sociopolitical wellbeing]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} is essential to sustain action for just change. YCO
[offered **scaffolding** to less experienced]{.underline} young
[organizers]{.underline}, [which enabled them to
participate]{.underline}, even if they were initially nervous or shy.
Because of the culture of care, the acknowledgement of the work as
rooted in something greater than the individual---freedom dreaming---and
the deep desire for change or an otherwise more just world, which is in
resonance with spiritual activism, young organizers' sociopolitical
wellbeing was fostered. When young organizers take the mic, as speakers
at a rally or stakeholder meeting, for example, they often use a script
or notecards, and over time they develop their confidence in public
speaking and leverage their experiences, emotions, and support system to
sustain their political action alongside their wellbeing. [These links
are **key** to nourishing]{.underline} a relational process of healing
and the transformation of oppressive conditions of inequity and violence
\[2\].

YCO settings that practice healing-oriented values can help youth
overcome the challenges that come with activism and movement-building.
When provided with support, youth can lead [[**organizing efforts** and
**campaigns**]{.mark} that]{.underline} further [[reinforce
**collectivized care**]{.underline}, **[spiritual
activism]{.underline}**, [and **freedom dreaming**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Participating YCO groups demonstrated relational practices that affirmed
the dignity and humanity of oppressed youth and their communities.
Trust, intergenerational relationships, and mutual support contributed
to sustained youth participation over time. [These qualities provided a
safe]{.underline}, [intellectual space for]{.underline} dialogue on
ideas, **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and reflection. One common
practice was to try to apply a more egalitarian or democratic set of
norms related to power differences based on age. As young organizers,
they tended to be intentional about the relevance of age as a social
category and how age should be considered for organizational
decision-making. YCO used terms such as intergenerational, youth-adult
partnership-oriented, or youth-centered, each with slightly different
meanings, to characterize their approach. Young organizers' experience
of voice and power often contrasted with their experiences in school, a
point that Kendall expressed in the opening vignette. These examples,
along with the healing-oriented values we observed, were anchored in a
YCO culture of belonging, forming friendships and family-like
relationships, self and collective love, and an affirmation that what
they experienced was shared among other members of their organizing
group or movement. Most importantly, within YCO settings, freedom dreams
of radical hopes for change, sustained by collectivized care, and
spiritual activism were intertwined.

Participating in YCO offered learning environments [that
[enabled]{.mark} young [organizers to **translate**]{.mark}
reflection]{.underline}, [[research]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and dialogue
[into]{.mark} **political action**]{.underline}. Young
[organizers]{.underline} like Kendall, among others whose voices we
featured engaged in YCO, [developed a **critical understanding** and
**analysis** of their social context and **core skills** for
leadership]{.underline}, [community engagement]{.underline}, [and
democratic participation]{.underline}. [These findings are **consistent
with prior research**]{.underline} on the impact of community organizing
and civic engagement experiences \[36,74,75,76\]. Additionally, there
was diversity in strategies for engaging and mobilizing youth at varied
sites, particularly across nations. [The **international scope** of our
research study]{.underline} was a strength, and it [attests to the value
of this work]{.underline}. This diversity is important because it can
contribute to new strategies for YCO to use. To further explain, certain
educational practices in EE that helped young organizers like Kendall
learn about their connection to historical struggles and building a
national movement may be of interest to youth and YCO outside of South
Africa. Similarly, [the ability]{.underline} of YCOs such as PJU and
Coleman Advocates [to achieve **new**]{.underline} state and city
**[legislation]{.underline}** dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline
[is **important** for groups that wish to make [**institutional impact**
and **systemic policy change**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[77\].

[Our study's findings underscore the importance of]{.underline}
healing-oriented values in YCO [settings that]{.underline} help foster
opportunities to [facilitate youth **[political]{.mark}
action**]{.underline}, **[[activism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
**voice**]{.underline}, alongside sociopolitical wellbeing.
[Participation]{.underline} in movements for justice, rights, and
dignity, while certainly presenting challenges to young organizers, like
burnout, [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [offer]{.underline} meaningful
[opportunities]{.underline} for them [to [develop]{.mark} the
[capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [skills]{.underline},
interpersonal/introspective [insights]{.underline}, [[and relational
networks to **prevent burnout**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[or]{.mark} at
the very least]{.underline}, [**recognize** it and [seek]{.mark} out
**[support]{.mark}** before it compromises one's health]{.underline}. We
have offered this paper as an invitation to ongoing dialogue and
theoretical and empirical research on the intersections of youth
sociopolitical development, YCO, and wellbeing. The three interconnected
healing-centered values we offered, which young organizers put into
practice, show how young organizers engage these to support political
action. Moreover, these values also help cultivate young organizers'
socioemotional awareness, which is needed for long-term engagement in
justice-centered work.

Marks Adam)

A second [approach to]{.underline} [make room for emerging and future
socioeconomic alternatives]{.underline} [involves analyzing narratives
and discourses of the future and their potential to enable or disable
possibilities for just outcomes]{.underline}. Andrew S. Mathews and
Jessica Barnes (2016) argue that [the future is a site of
struggle]{.underline}, [one that is constantly being made in the present
through policy making and political action]{.underline}. Haarstad,
Sareen, and Wanvik (2023) explore [the potential of aspirational goals,
such as Norway\'s Zero Growth Objective, to shape and articulate
present-day climate politics. While some goals may seem lofty or even
impossible, they argue **that a vision of an ideal future can help
prefigure more just outcomes**]{.underline}. However, as Kasia Paprocki
(2019) points out, narratives of ruined futures---of climate-related
threats, such as sea-level rise along the rural coasts of
Bangladesh---are powerful tools used by elites seeking to dispossess
farmers of their lands. [Implicit in Paprocki\'s work, we argue, is the
affirmation that narratives of possible futures]{.underline}, [where
lives can flourish despite climate impacts, is equally as important for
what we see as the promise of speculative political
ecology]{.underline}. Along these lines, we are [also inspired by the
work of Black Geographies, and of abolitionist geographies
specifically]{.underline}, which, [through their critique of the
carceral system and the prison-industrial complex that drives it,
presents visions of a future that exists outside of the confines of the
violence of racial capitalism]{.underline} (Gilmore 2007, 2022).
Further, this scholarship revisits historical injustices---of land
stolen from Black farming families, for example (Heynen 2016)---[and
aims to create conditions for more equitable, reparative pathways for
communities impacted by destructive socioecological
relations]{.underline} (Heynen and Ybarra 2021; Lewis 2023).

In sum, we argue that [**leaning into [speculation]{.mark}** [is a
generative means]{.mark} [of theorizing and analyzing]{.mark} [how past
and present conditions]{.mark} [shape the contours of the
future]{.mark}. Here, we want to acknowledge, and reiterate, that much
of political ecology\'s strength is in its grounded approach to
empirical knowledge production]{.underline}. We [do not see speculation
as dismissive of or lacking empirical analysis]{.underline}. [Rather,
many speculative approaches described here depart from rich empirical
analyses]{.underline} [of past and present socioecological relations
that shape the current environmental and climate crises and its uneven
outcomes, as well as from lived experiments of more desirable
socioecological configurations]{.underline}. Moreover[, drawing from
fields like queer theory and speculative fiction, we see [speculation as
**a means of creating empirical analysis**]{.mark},]{.underline}
[[similar to]{.mark} [how climate model]{.mark} [predictions are]{.mark}
[treated as empirical evidence]{.mark} of future climate
scenarios]{.underline}. **[Speculation]{.underline} [is a tool to
engage]{.underline}** [with "important **questions of potential that are
often dismissed** because they are not as empirically legible as typical
political ecology scholarship"]{.underline} that tends to focus on
histories of the present (Harris and Santos 2023, 3). The work of
engaging directly in the politics of imagination is a critical first
step toward a more critical version of speculation.

Conclusions---doing speculative and experimental political ecologies:
reparative, proactive, and creative knowledges

In this paper, we have explored the potential of a political ecology
that engages socioecological relations more experimentally and
speculatively. We have shown that complementary theoretical
frameworks---from Diverse Economies to Feminist analyses of Science,
Science Fiction, Black Geographies, Queer Theory, and Multispecies
Ethnographies---[[open up **intellectual**]{.mark} [**spaces** to
experiment]{.mark} with new modes of critique **[within
political]{.mark} [ecology scholarship]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Crucially, [these **[theoretical perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}
have the potential to **[[generate]{.mark} [new registers of
consciousness]{.mark} [that make room for hope, possibility,]{.mark}
[survival, resistance, and creativity]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Concurrently, we have argued that [some of these intellectual stands are
already informing experimental and speculative political
ecology.]{.underline}

To conclude, we highlight what we see as the potential of a political
ecology that engages with experimentation and speculation by returning
to our initial question on the performativity of political-ecological
knowledge. Following Sedgwick\'s and Latour\'s "critique of critique,"
we ask [what knowledge generated through speculative and experimental
approaches does]{.underline}. Specifically, [we consider what these
approaches add to understandings of socioecological relations and to
political-ecological praxis.]{.underline} [First]{.underline},
[experimental and [speculative approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[are
critical]{.underline}** [for laying the foundations of]{.underline}
]{.mark}[a [future-oriented and reparative mode]{.mark} [of critique
that]{.mark} **[illuminates]{.mark} emerging and [future
possibilities]{.mark}** of alternative worlds]{.underline}. Steven Cork
et al. (2023, 26) claim that **[[actualizing fundamental
transformations]{.underline}]{.mark}** in socionatural relations
[[**requires** enhanced abilities]{.underline} [to "imagine pathways
toward alternative,]{.underline} ]{.mark}[preferable
[futures."]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet, they note that [contemporary
societies]{.underline} are sometimes unequipped with the cognitive and
psychological skills needed to imagine different futures, particularly
when it comes to "possibilities not encountered before---and the
possible pathways toward achieving them." Experimental and
[speculative]{.underline} [approaches [leverage the]{.mark} [power
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [stories]{.underline} and storytelling,
[[imagination]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[creativity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to "engage directly]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [politics]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[of expanding
imaginative]{.underline}, [perspectival, and political
capacity"]{.underline}** (Harris 2022; Harris and Santos 2023, 524).

[Second]{.underline}, the quest for reparative critique is entangled
with its [[potential to]{.mark} transform and [carry material
change]{.mark}. [Engaging with]{.mark} [questions about]{.mark} the
possible, alternative,]{.underline} [and [desirable futures contributes
to questioning]{.mark} [assumptions about]{.mark} [the
inevitability]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [current
and [future]{.mark} socionatural [configurations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Concurrently, centering research on desired futures can strengthen
commitments to these futures by provoking stakeholders' reflections on
how to achieve them and, potentially, reconfigure decision-making around
these aspirations (Smith and Vasudevan 2017; Heynen and Ybarra 2021;
Pelling et al. 2023; Willemin and Backhaus 2021).

[Third]{.underline}, while maintaining a strong focus on generating
theory from rigorous empirical work, [[speculative]{.mark} and
experimental [approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} [[reconfigure]{.mark}
[research]{.mark} and praxis [within political
ecology]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, speculative political
ecology scholarship proposes that [the act of
[speculation]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is a form of research]{.mark} both
[because it is often grounded in]{.mark} rich [empirical analyses of
past]{.mark} and present socioecological configurations [and because it
**generates data on desired futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Speculative
[political ecologies]{.underline}, [[therefore]{.underline},]{.mark}
[[allow for new ways of pluralizing knowledge]{.mark} [that center on
desired]{.mark} socioecological [futures, rather than "just" on past and
present configurations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [performative
epistemologies]{.underline} are [grounded on a research process that
also involves enacting socioecological interventions]{.underline}.
[Questions regarding how to navigate the relationship between critique
and activism have always been at the center of political ecology debates
(Blaikie 2012; Blomley 2008; Loftus 2015). The performative
epistemologies discussed in this paper offer a range of approaches to
"[**think critically** **but**]{.mark} **to also [act
experimentally]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Harris 2021, 332).

### Flattening---2AC

#### Theoretically flattening under an abstract paradigm of violence [lacks]{.underline} analytic purchase.

**Kornbluh, 24**---Professor of English at the University of Illinois,
Chicago (Anna, "Antitheory," *Immediacy, or The Style of Too Late
Capitalism*, Chapter 5, pp. 145-149, dml)

The [[leveling of distinctions]{.underline}]{.mark} characteristic of
immediacy theory often broaches a dissolutionist nihilism that
[**absolutizes** and [**dematerializes** states]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[laws]{.underline}, [and power relations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and
**abnegates** alternative formations or alternative affordances of
political-institutional forms]{.underline}. When that kind of
argumentation prevails, [[its ambition is
**indistinction**]{.underline}:]{.mark} [**harm-seeking laser vision**
sees particular injustices impugn the notion of justice]{.underline};
turtles all the way down. A brilliant and much-laureled example of this
indistinction is the [discourse of]{.underline} \"university abolition\"
in the work of Stefano Harney and Fred Moten and their
students/followers. Rather than distinguish between [the institutional
operations and effects of the **university** and the **prison
system**]{.underline}, Harney and Moten [**recurrently assimilate** the
one to the other]{.underline}. In their essay \"The University (Last
Words),\" for instance, they directly liken a research fellowship to one
of the cruelest of carceral practices, solitary confinement:

The university is a fortress whose various appearances---refuge and
refugee camp, writer\'s colony and colony betray its deep, various,
nefarious functions . only in the university can winning a fellowship
mean access to solitude . . a set of fantasies, ranging from
transparency to blackening, held in relational solitary confinement that
mistakes the restricted (re)forms of the academy\'s general population
for the 49 revolutionary force of a general intellectual metaeconomy.

A lecture and teach-in on this essay takes the point even farther: in
the middle of the largest protest movement ever to transpire in this
country, a movement explicitly against police violence, they observe
\"so much of our work is about how the vast majority of the policing
that gets done in the university is done by administrators and faculty
and not by the police 50 forces.\" And a manifesto authored by their
students in their name further blends the concerted right-wing campaign
to defund higher education into a radically flashy movement to
\"abolish\" college. While there are countless critical pedagogy
critiques and studies of the school-to-prison-pipeline that would
substantiate more subtle versions of these imbrications, [juxtaposed

disarming and defunding campus cops, [[by **generalizing

the vast differences among institutions and outcomes in higher education
in favor of this monolith of domination, \"the university,\"
conveniently eliding that the majority of university instruction happens
in small public places or that the enormous earnings gap between degree
holders and those with less education continues to widen, and rankly
allying with Republican efforts to tar higher education as an elite
playground. Ecological theorist Andreas Malm decries this indistinction
for the incapacity it begets; [[the point of such]{.mark} flattening
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [\"[to **ruin as much analytic equipment as
possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" 51 [[A vision that paints]{.mark}

[brush can]{.mark} have as its **[only]{.mark} outcome** the
**aggrandizing** of the critic]{.underline}. In perpetrating [these
indistinctions]{.underline}, criticism forswears its task of cutting,
instead rhapsodizing dismantling when it could be honing the mantle of
emancipatory structuration. Such [theologies]{.underline} of the
negative [**foreshadow** and [**refract** activist
practice]{.mark}]{.underline} in the present omnicrisis, [where
insurgencies repudiate value assertions]{.underline}, [anarchic rhizomes
reject organization]{.underline}, [apathetic floods refuse
voting]{.underline}, [and visions of total destruction decline positive
constructions]{.underline}.

In unhistorical dematerialized nihilism, [horrors of the present are
**chained** to horrors of the past in continuous current]{.underline},
[**overflowing** the record of struggle for **freedom** and of
**contingent events** with the oceans of domination]{.underline}. The
identity of past and present (\"It has always been this way\") poses to
capture the essence of the social order in its unchanging stone, a
revelation of truth that endures unscathed. [Similarly does the
disposition away from change and toward essence involve a frequent
**[ontologization]{.mark}** of contingent social processes]{.underline},
[so that]{.underline} \"[**[racialization]{.underline}**\"
[becomes]{.underline} \"**[ontological]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[anti-Blackness]{.underline}**\" [[and]{.underline}
\"**[patriarchy]{.underline}**\" [becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[the
logic of **[misogyny]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"52 There are frequently
spiritual or theological overtones to these epics of \"original sin,\"
and [their rhetorical and epistemological effect]{.underline}, as
historian Matt Karp and others have observed, [is]{.underline} the
keenness of 53 **[immutability]{.underline}**. By the light of the
category of immediacy, we can see how this eternity of immanence, this
ineluctable total everythingness, mirrors the motifs of timeless
instantaneity and frictionless flow that organize the culture of
circulation.

The appeal of these "poetheories" and nihilisms is undeniable, and
inarguability is baked into their ethos. Therefore, it is crucial to
appreciate the critiques and counterpositions offered by more
materialist and dialectical thinkers of racialization, such as Angela
Davis, Achille Mbembe, Olúfemi Táíwò, or Anthony Reed, who, in turn,
find inspiration in the internationalist anti-imperialism of Frantz
Fanon or Gayatri Spivak.

Davis explicitly criticizes the "nationalism" and idealism of the
paradigm of "anti-Blackness," because [the]{.underline} "[center on
**pain** and **injury**]{.underline} ... [can create **barriers** to
developing solidarity]{.underline}" and because "the importance of black
people's histories in the Americas resides precisely in the fact that
there has been an ongoing freedom struggle for many centuries, [the
centrality of black struggles is **much more** about **freedom** than it
is about **blackness**]{.underline}." Mbembe concurs that the
"absolutization" operates in the realm of the ideal, reifying
contingencies and eclipsing freedom and solidarity: "Afro-pessimism is
also premised on the idea of a categorial antagonism that cannot be
transcended." Drawing upon the work of Nigerian novelist Amos Tutuola,
Mbembe argues for heterogeneity and contradiction as the contrasts to
absolutism and nihilism:

[The most efficient logic of action is not **flight** and **escape** or
**fugitivity**]{.underline} ([but]{.underline}) clearing the pathways of
composition. This is not about fugitivity; it is about [the capacity to
**assemble** and **compose**]{.underline}... it is a different way of
inhabitation of the world ... Freedom consists in the full inhabitation
of the world, an embrace of its contradictions.

Táíwò, in stark contrast to Yusoff's demolition, takes the concept of
the Anthropocene as an opportunity to advocate for "constructive"
reparations: since "the connection between climate crisis, slavery, and
colonialism flows from distributions of wealth and vulnerability created
by centuries of global politics and its ecological consequences, layered
with more recent histories of pollution in the Global North and
corporate fossil fuel interests," it is necessary for there to be
centralized restitution that anticipates future suffering. Reed
powerfully argues that "the turn to theorizing (anti)Blackness as
ontology, and the (re)turn to theorizing the inner life/subjective
experience are two sides of one anticollective ultimately anti-utopian
coin." The obverse of immediacy's immutability and spiritualization is
this embrace of construction, contradiction, contingency---of struggle
and solidarity. Mediations are many-textured compositions that sustain
inconsistencies and de-complete or de-immanentize, holding open the
possibilities of practical connection in and through action to build.

The magnetism of immediacy theory, however, can repose in closing these
possibilities. [[If nothing is **changeable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [if
solidarity **fails**]{.underline}, [if it is **too late**]{.underline},
[[the obligation to act **dissipates**]{.underline}. [In
its]{.underline}]{.mark} [[place arise]{.mark} valiant theories of the
**undesirability of action itself**]{.underline}, [along with [**entire
lexicons** for recriminating]{.mark} the **instrumentalism** and
**compromise** of [politics]{.mark}, and recasting politics as
**ontologization**]{.underline}. An eloquent idiolect of this
resignation is "antipolitics," a "beyond of politics" in which [alterity
and negation **disrupt** and **undo** the ordinary order of
things]{.underline}, [including its ordinary prescriptions for
**organization** and **struggle**]{.underline}. Theory perpetually
relativizes itself vis-à-vis practice and has historically wrestled with
the problem of immediacy in questions about the imminence of revolution,
the immanence of the general will, spontaneity, and party-planning---[a
**swath** of thinkers]{.underline} from Thomas Hobbes and Gustave Le Bon
to Bruno Bauer and Karl Marx, from Sigmund Freud to Rosa Luxemburg and
Vladimir Lenin, from Angela Davis to Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri,
[have **recurrently asked**]{.underline} whether the mass or class is
identical to itself and on a trajectory of becoming conscious of itself,
[[what intellectuals do to]{.mark} **facilitate** or [**impede** mass
action]{.mark}]{.underline}, and whether political theory is inherently
descriptive and belated, or possibly projective and electrifying. But
[now]{.underline}, in the present theoretical landscape, [the questions
seem **decided** and the match seems **won**]{.underline}; antipolitics
renounces the mediation of organization, antitheory renounces the
mediation of theory, and immediacy autonomizes.

[[Assessing not only the]{.mark} known [world but also]{.mark} available
[paths out of it as]{.mark}]{.underline} ["[**inherently unfixable** and
**beyond**]{.underline}]{.mark} resuscitation,
**[[reform]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or rescue" (as one self-proclaimed
"insurgent" journal declares), contemporary [[antipolitics
**absolutizes** a **transhistorical**]{.underline}]{.mark},
dematerialized ether of [[abjection while **infinitely dispersing**
resistances that]{.underline}]{.mark} thwart amalgamation. While an
"anarchist sublime" has long piqued theory-savvy politics, in its latest
iterations the algorithmic imprint is undeniable: again, that pattern of
infinitization paired with a succession of singularities. Immanence
[[**evacuates** politics]{.underline}]{.mark}: "Power is no longer
concentrated in one point in the world; it is the world itself, its
flows and avenues", the Invisible Committee intones, and thus any action
expedites flow. Philosopher Roberto Esposito outlines the restless
negativity of antipolitics vis-à-vis official exercises of power with
his notion of the "impolitical": "Politics cannot be conceptualized in
positive form but only on the basis of that which draws its contours at
its outer margin and which determines it negatively, constituting both
its ground and its reverse side." Negativity as end in itself animates
gender theorist Jack Halberstam's "anti-political project of unmaking."
And, most influentially, Harney and Moten conceive flight from
collective power as "fugitivity":

We owe it to each other to falsify the institution, to make politics
incorrect, to give the lie to our own determination. We owe each other
the indeterminate. We owe each other everything. An abdication of
political responsibility? OK. Whatever. We're just anti-politically
romantic about actually existing social life. We aren't responsible for
politics. We are the general antagonism to politics looming outside
every attempt to politicize, every imposition of self-governance, every
sovereign decision and its degraded miniature, every emergent state and
home sweet home.

The Small War

Definition

Elevating the power dynamics at play among actors internal to a movement
over the larger power dynamics in society. In nonprofits or social
justice organizations, this often takes the shape of focusing on
tensions playing out between junior staff and leadership. In social
movements, it may show up as conflicts between movement formations,
sectarian ideological groupings, or movement leaders.

In prioritizing the small war, one [[accepts the notion that **all sites
of struggle are equal** and that]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[making change
**wherever you are**]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[includes addressing]{.mark}
the [demands placed]{.mark} on you [as a]{.mark}]{.underline}
functionary of a small nonprofit or a **[[local
activist]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a community group. [[Refusal to wage
the small war may]{.mark} therefore [be seen as **shirking**]{.mark} **a
vital [responsibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} to maintain egalitarian
power relations. [[Because **proximity** becomes the **most important
factor**]{.mark} in deciding where to take action]{.underline},
[[this]{.mark} thinking often **[lacks]{.mark}** a [structural]{.mark}
and systemic [analysis]{.mark} of oppression [and can feed or be fed by
**disproportionality**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([or the [inability to

Using one's identity or personal experience as a justification for a
political position. You may hear someone argue, "As a working-class,
first-generation American, Southern woman...I say we have to vote no."
What's [[implied is that one\'s identity is a **comprehensive
validator** of one's]{.mark} political
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[that identity is evidence of some
**intrinsic**]{.mark} **ideological** or **[strategic
legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Marginalized identity is deployed as
a **conveyor** of a strategic truth that **must simply be
accepted**]{.underline}. Likewise, [historically privileged identities
are **essentialized**]{.underline}, **[flattened]{.underline}**, [and
frequently]{.underline}---for better or worse---
**[dismissed]{.underline}**.

Fallacies

To be clear, personal identity and individual experience are important.
And while it is true that the "personal is political," [[the personal
**cannot trump strategy** nor should it **overwhelm the collective
interest**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Identity is **too broad** a container
to predict one's **politics** or the **validity** of a particular
position]{.underline}. [There are **over 40 million** Black folk in the
US]{.underline}. [Some have **great** politics]{.underline}, [some do
**not**]{.underline}. One's racial or gender identity, sex, or
[membership in any marginalized community is]{.underline}, in and of
itself, [**insufficient information** to]{.underline} position someone
in leadership or [mandate that their perspective be
adopted]{.underline}.

[People with marginal identities]{.underline}, as human beings, [suffer
all the **frailties**]{.underline}, **[inconsistencies]{.underline}**,
[and **failings** of any other human]{.underline}.
[[Genuflecting]{.mark} to individuals solely [based on]{.mark} their
socialized [**identities** or]{.mark} personal [**stories** **deprives**
them of the conditions that **sharpen arguments**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[develop skills]{.underline}**, [and **win

historically marginalized or oppressed groups [by seeking to
**placate**]{.mark} or **pander** [instead of being in a right
relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [which requires]{.underline}]{.mark}
struggle, **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[disagreement]{.underline}**, [and **hard
work**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[This]{.mark} type of [**false

and solidarity among diverse voices is **serious labor**]{.underline}.
After all, "**[steel sharpens steel]{.underline}**."

[Neoliberal identity politics **strips**]{.underline} from identity
politics [a focus on **collective power** or a political project and
demand]{.underline}. [What's left is a **narrow tool** used as a
**personal cudgel**]{.underline} or, as Barbara Smith has said, "It's
[like they've taken the **identity** and left the **politics** on the
floor]{.underline}." It should be noted that we have already seen this
tactic used against us on the Left and the Right in the fight for racial
and economic justice. Identity in [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} context
[**[reaffirms]{.mark}** the [individualistic]{.mark} principles of
[neoliberalism instead of **challenging**]{.mark} them]{.underline}.

#### That's [offense]{.underline}---deference is [moral licensure]{.underline} that [actively justifies]{.underline} exclusion.

**al-Gharbi, 24**---assistant professor in the School of Communication
and Journalism at Stony Brook University (Musa, "Mystification of Social
Processes," *We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a
New Elite*, Chapter 6, pp. 291-294, dml)

Moral credentialing is a phenomenon where [[people become **more
likely** to act in inegalitarian ways]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (critically) [[become convinced that their
actions are **nonbiased**]{.underline}, [**after** affirming their
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} [to egalitarianism or engaging in
behaviors they interpret as egalitarian]{.underline}. For instance,
[**studies** have shown that when white people publicly
affirm]{.underline} their commitment to **[antiracism]{.underline}**,
[they often become more likely to]{.underline} subsequently [favor other
whites]{.underline} in decisions like hiring and promotion, [even as
they grow more confident that race **played no role** in their
decision-making]{.underline}. [When men identify with
**feminism**]{.underline}, [they regularly grow more likely to favor
other men]{.underline} in their decision-making, [but also grow more
confident that their judgments were **nonbiased**]{.underline}.70 People
are especially likely to seek or to brandish their "moral credentials"
in the face of actual or anticipated questioning of their behaviors.
That is, if we have done, or are about to do, something that might be
viewed as controversial or "sketchy," we often try to remind ourselves
and others about what good people we are---and this often does change
how the behaviors in question are subsequently interpreted.71

At times, however, [[**conspicuously aligning** ourselves]{.mark} with
social justice causes can not only blind us to the **immorality** of our
actions]{.underline}, [it [can]{.mark} even [lead us to **feel
entitled** to do things we recognize as immoral]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and to view these behaviors as **acceptable** for us to engage
in]{.underline}, [at that moment]{.underline}, [under those
circumstances]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} called "**[[moral
licensing]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [[In virtue of]{.mark} prosocial
[actions people]{.mark} have performed or plan to
[perform]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[or]{.mark} even upon contemplating bad
actions one [refrained from]{.mark} taking]{.underline}), [people can
feel it is **acceptable** to personally take liberties they would
**ordinarily condemn** in others]{.underline}.72 [[They]{.mark} can
[**exempt themselves** from the]{.mark} moral [standards they
apply]{.mark} to everyone else]{.underline}, [confident that the good
actions they]{.underline} have performed, or will [perform]{.underline}
([or other bad actions they]{.underline} have taken or will [refrain
from]{.underline} taking), [will]{.underline} basically "**[even things
out]{.underline}**" [ethically]{.underline}, result in a net positive,
or at least fail to harm their reputation.73 As with moral
credentialing, people are often strategic about moral licensing: when we
want to violate a rule or norm that others are bound by, we often seek
out and brandish evidence of our exemplary moral character, painting
ourselves as worthy of a bit of indulgence (or of leniency in judgment
at the very least).74

This is not just something individuals do. It occurs at the
institutional level as well. Indeed, corporate leaders are often quite
explicit about engaging in moral licensing. For example, consulting firm
McKinsey & Co. emphasizes that environmental, social, and governance
investing is necessary for companies to "maintain their social license"
in the face of externalities that multinational corporations impose on
governments, workers, communities, and ecosystems worldwide.75 BlackRock
CEO and cofounder Larry Fink has likewise emphasized that, insofar as
companies fail to portray themselves as oriented toward some higher
cause than maximizing profits, they will "ultimately lose the license to
operate from key stakeholders" and provide subpar returns to investors
as a result.76 Behaviors recognized as "greenwashing," "pinkwashing,"
"diversity washing," and "rainbow washing," are generally clumsy
attempts at moral licensing. Insofar as these institutional commitments
instead come off as "sincere" or "au thentic" (whatever it might mean
for an institution to be sincere), the organization can be considered to
have successfully engaged in moral licensing.

Sometimes, however, we engage in behaviors that we (and others)
recognize as wrong, and we can't make these perceptions go away by
simply emphasizing how moral we are. Other times, we come to see
ourselves (or are viewed by others) as complicit in the immoral
behaviors of institutions or other stakeholders we're associated with.
In other cases, we find ourselves unwilling or unable to do what we
think we should in morally freighted situations--- creating harm not
through something we did but by something we failed to do (or failed to
do effectively). In situations like these, where our self-image and
reputation are compromised or at risk, [we often engage in rituals of
**moral cleansing**]{.underline}---[behaviors that help restore the
sense that we're]{.underline} "[on the side of the angels]{.underline}."
And it turns out that [one of the most effective ways we can come to
feel good about ourselves in the aftermath of a moral failing is to
**point out bad behaviors in others**]{.underline}. [**Research** shows
that [condemning and]{.mark}]{.underline} (especially)
[[sanctioning]{.mark} others for wrongdoing [can **reduce one's
guilt**]{.mark}]{.underline} over committing the same offense [and helps
assure oneself and others that they are **different**]{.underline} from
"those people" being condemned (even if one is, in fact, engaged in
similar or worse behaviors).77 Sometimes we can be so effective at
cleansing our guilt that [[we grow **more self-righteous**]{.mark} than
we were before our moral failing]{.underline}. In these instances,
[[moral cleansing can provide]{.mark} us with **moral credentials** or
**[licenses]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is, [moral cleansing doesn't
just eliminate our shame]{.underline}, [[it can]{.mark} actually
**[enable future bad conduct]{.mark}**]{.underline}, this time [carried
out with a clear conscience]{.underline}.

However, should moral credentialing, licensing, and cleansing
collectively fail at preserving our sense self-image and reputation, we
often resort to moral disengagement instead: redefining situations in
ways that neutralize their moral stakes. Sometimes we do this by
downplaying the risks or costs imposed on others by our actions or by
insisting that any negative eventualities were caused by circumstances
beyond our own control, thereby minimizing our own perceived role in
others' misfortune. Other times, we tell ourselves that difficulties
imposed on others serve some worthy goal or "greater good." In other
cases, we recast the people who were harmed so that they no longer fall
into our sphere of moral concern, or even seem to deserve misfortune.78
For instance, this chapter highlighted how symbolic capitalists often
define minorities who espouse inconvenient views as "compromised" in
some way, allowing us to simply disregard their perspectives despite our
expressed commitments to epistemic and moral deference toward people
from historically marginalized and disadvantaged groups. This is moral
disengagement in action.

Critically, [there are **peer effects**]{.underline} for each of these
phenomena as well: [when we observe others]{.underline} "like
us"---people and institutions we identify with--- [making egalitarian
pronouncements or gestures]{.underline}, or taking prosocial actions,
[we become **more likely** to see those people and ourselves as
egalitarians]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [we become **more likely** to
interpret subsequent inegalitarian behaviors from peers or ourselves
as]{.underline} fundamentally fair or otherwise
**[acceptable]{.underline}**.79 When individuals or institutions we
identify with present themselves as moral exemplars, [we feel **more
entitled** to exempt ourselves from the standards we would normally
apply to others]{.underline}.80 Meanwhile, being confronted with
evidence that people "like us" are responsible for unjust harm to others
often leads to "competitive victimhood"---that is, claiming that harmful
behaviors people "like us" visited on others are justified or should be
excused in light of wrongs that people "like us" have previously
experienced.81 In other cases, [[guilt]{.mark} over harm caused by
people]{.underline} "**[like us]{.underline}**" [[fuels]{.mark} moral
[outrage against **third-party scapegoats**]{.mark}]{.underline};
[subsequent [retributive actions]{.mark}]{.underline} against these
scapegoats [tends to [cleanse our]{.mark} own guilt or
[shame]{.mark}]{.underline}.82 Or, [all else failing]{.underline},
[[we]{.mark} find ways to [**collectively write off** concern
about]{.mark} those harmed by the pursuit of our own group
interests]{.underline}. For instance, [symbolic capitalists]{.underline}
regularly [portray]{.underline} the "**[[losers]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
in the symbolic economy [as unworthy of moral consideration [because
they're]{.mark}]{.underline} racist, or sexist, or transphobic, or
[[ignorant]{.underline}]{.mark}, or support "fascists" like Donald
Trump. [If]{.underline} "**[those people]{.underline}**" [are
marginalized]{.underline}, **[good]{.underline}**. **[They should
be]{.underline}**. [[If they're suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**w[ho
cares]{.mark}**[?]{.mark}]{.underline}

One disturbing implication of these cognitive tendencies is that, [in
contexts where people and institutions go around denouncing
racism]{.underline}, [sexism]{.underline}, [or inequality to one another
**constantly**]{.underline}---painting themselves as staunch advocates
for social justice and condemning those who are "backwards" or
"regressive"---[[it would become]{.mark} **almost [impossible]{.mark}**
for folks embedded in those circles [to see the role]{.mark} that [they
play]{.mark} in perpetuating systemic inequalities]{.underline}. And in
part for this reason, [these same [people]{.mark} would [promote]{.mark}
various forms of [inequality **all the more** while
feeling]{.mark}]{.underline} incredibly
[[self-righteous]{.underline}]{.mark} about their egalitarianism.

That is, [in environments [where]{.mark}]{.underline} antiracism,
feminism, and other [egalitarian [frameworks are **widely**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} very [**[publicly embraced]{.underline}**, [it
can become **easier** for people to act in]{.underline}]{.mark} racist,
sexist, or other wise [[discriminatory ways]{.mark} while convinced that
their behaviors are fair]{.underline}---[and to have those actions
actually perceived as fair by others who share the same]{.underline}
ideological and political [leanings]{.underline}, or who belong to the
same social or institutional groups. In contexts like these, **[[each
conspicuous gesture]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward social justice [would
[blind]{.mark} oneself and one's peers [to **important details** about
how]{.mark}]{.underline} various [forms of]{.underline} inequality,
exploitation, and [[exclusion are produced]{.mark} and
maintained]{.underline}---[[and generate both **opportunities** and
**temptations**]{.underline}]{.mark} for oneself and one's peers [[to
behave in ways they might **otherwise**]{.mark} be able to [recognize as
**immoral**]{.mark}]{.underline}.83

[Campaigns to **sterilize language**]{.underline}, for instance, [will
**never lift anyone out of poverty**]{.underline}. Referring to homeless
people as "unsheltered individuals," or prisoners as "justice-involved
persons," or poor people as "individuals of limited means," and so on
are [discursive maneuvers]{.underline} that [often **obscure** the
brutal realities that others must confront in their day-to-day
lives]{.underline}. If the intent of these language shifts is to avoid
stigma, the reality is that these [populations are **still heavily
stigmatized** despite shifting discourse]{.underline}.

As we have seen, [the Americans who are most preoccupied with linguistic
hygiene **actively avoid** personally interacting with]{.underline} the
poor, convicted criminals, drug addicts, and others through strategies
ranging from personal network choices to where they choose to live (and
send their kids to school); their reduced use of public transportation;
the zoning restrictions they typically support; their heightened use of
police, personal security, and surveillance services against [folks who
violate their aesthetic sensibilities or behavioral
preferences]{.underline}; and beyond. More broadly, [**gentrifying** the
discourse about the]{.underline} "**[wretched of the
earth]{.underline}**" **[doesn't make their problems go
away]{.underline}**. If anything, [it **renders elites more
complacent**]{.underline} when we talk about the plight of " those
people." On this [the empirical research is **quite
clear**]{.underline}:92 [euphemisms render people **more comfortable**
with immoral behaviors and unjust states of affairs]{.underline}. This
is one of the main reasons we rely on euphemisms at all.

### AT: Microaggressions/Voting Issues\*

#### Theorizing the ballot as an accountability measure is itself an elite privilege that both [proves the link]{.underline} and [weaponizes]{.underline} debate against marginalized groups in favor of elite interests.

**al-Gharbi, 24**---assistant professor in the School of Communication
and Journalism at Stony Brook University (Musa, "Mystification of Social
Processes," *We Have Never Been Woke: The Cultural Contradictions of a
New Elite*, Chapter 6, pp. 276-279, dml)

Within a victimhood culture, [one of the very worst [charges]{.mark}
that could be leveled [against someone]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially
against a person who lacks totemic capital (which can be leveraged to
partially insulate oneself against such accusations)---[is that they are
themselves **victimizers**]{.underline}, [or [that they harbor
**animus**]{.mark} toward victimized populations]{.underline}. Symbolic
capitalists and affiliated institutions often ritualistically describe
themselves as racist, sexist, and so on in a paradoxical bid to
demonstrate their virtue. However, [to have others brand one as a
**bigot**]{.underline}, and to be treated as a bigot, [is a form of
**symbolic death**]{.underline}: [those perceived by others to be
appropriately labeled]{.underline} with terms like "racist" or "sexist"
[are held as being **unworthy** of having their perspectives or
priorities **taken seriously**]{.underline}; they are unworthy of
working in the symbolic professions (indeed, their employer risks moral
pollution if it does not cut ties, and colleagues risk moral pollution
if they come to the defense of the besieged); [they are unworthy of
being part of the social networks of enlightened people]{.underline};
[their work becomes viewed as]{.underline}
"**[contaminated]{.underline}**" ([and therefore worthy of
suspicion]{.underline}, [neglect]{.underline}, [or
censorship]{.underline}). In short, accusations of bigotry or
identity-based abuse are powerful weapons. They not only have the
capacity to vanquish enemies, but also enhance the relative status of
those who wield them. [This has [incentivized]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[concept creep]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [with respect to who counts
as a bigot and in virtue of what]{.underline}.24

In the past, for instance, "racism" primarily denoted overt
discrimination, bigotry, or racial animus. Incidents of this nature are
far less common today, and far less accepted, than they were in previous
decades.25 This is unambiguously great news. However, as a function of
the immense symbolic capital potentially at stake when accusations of
racism are made, and the diminishing opportunities to leverage that
capital by "calling out" obvious cases of racism, the sphere of what
counts as "racist" has been ever expanding---to the point where [it is
now [possible to qualify]{.mark}]{.underline} as "racist" [[on the basis
of]{.underline}]{.mark} things like [[**microaggressions** and
**implicit attitudes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Critically, it is
relatively well-off, highly educated, liberal whites who tend to be
among the most zealous in identifying and prosecuting these new forms of
"racism." Indeed, despite expressed aspirations to center the
perspectives of the marginalized and disadvantaged, and to honor their
priorities and preferences, white elites play an outsize role in setting
the agenda for contemporary antiracism (far more so than nonelite racial
and ethnic minorities).

In principle, this state of affairs could be defended on the grounds
that relatively well-off and highly educated liberal whites---precisely
in virtue of their college education and higher rates of consumption of
"woke" content in the media, online, and so on---perhaps understand the
reality and dynamics of racism better than the average Black or Hispanic
person. However, given that many of their preferred approaches to
"antiracism" are not just demonstrably ineffective but outright
counterproductive, I wouldn't recommend that anyone try to take a stand
on that hill.26 More realistically, it seems like many whites, in their
eagerness to present themselves as advocates for people of color and the
cause of antiracism, neglect to actually listen to ordinary Black or
brown folks about what they find offensive or harmful, or what their
racial priorities are.27 [Instead of seeking out the perspectives of
nonelites]{.underline}, white symbolic capitalists, typically in
partnership with "consecrated" [elites]{.underline} of color, [end up
defining]{.underline} "racism" [in ways that are congenial to their
**own preferences** and **priorities**]{.underline}. Rather than
actually dismantling "white supremacy" or meaningfully empowering people
of color, the "good whites" and their allies instead consolidate various
forms of capital in their own hands.

Under the auspices of promoting social justice, [many symbolic
capitalist spaces have become]{.underline} "**[hotbeds of craven
snitches]{.underline}**" [where [elites **weaponize** resources]{.mark}
established [to protect]{.mark} and support those who are genuinely
[marginalized]{.mark}]{.underline}, disadvantaged, vulnerable, or
victimized [in order [to]{.mark} settle **personal
vendettas**]{.underline}, [gain the **upper hand** in institutional
power struggles]{.underline}, [or **[purge]{.mark}** political and
ideological [opponents]{.mark}]{.underline}.28 The same anonymity
protections and impersonal processes intended to help shield actual
victims from bias and retaliation are regularly exploited by bad actors
to get revenge on exes, sabotage rivals, and enhance one's own personal
standing.29

[[Defenders]{.underline}]{.mark} of what has come to be referred to as
"cancel culture" often attempt to [[portray]{.mark} the phenomenon
as]{.underline} folks from less advantaged backgrounds [[holding
the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[privileged]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[to
**account**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, [the people engaged in these
practices are typically **themselves elites**]{.underline} or aspiring
elites. Again, symbolic capitalists tend to be among the most sensitive
and most easily offended sectors of U.S. society. It is people like us
who tend to be "very online," who focus intensely on race, gender,
sexuality, and politics, and who take part in online mobbings. It is
elites who are raised from a young age to understand and learn how
administrative systems and processes work, allowing them to know which
levers to pull to get people fired or disciplined, even on false or
exaggerated charges, while minimizing repercussions or blowback for
themselves. It is [elites]{.underline} who [feel comfortable [folding
**authorities** and **third parties** into]{.mark} their personal
[disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}, believing that these institutions,
processes, and professionals exist to serve their interests (not
wrongly), and that the system will typically work to their advantage
(not wrongly). It is people from elite backgrounds who simply expect
institutions and their representatives to accommodate their personal
preferences, priorities, and perspectives---and who will demand to
"speak to the manager" when they don't, and who know how to "speak to
the manager" to get what they want. [These kinds of]{.underline}
knowledge, dispositions, and [behaviors]{.underline} toward institutions
[are part of the]{.underline} "**[hidden curriculum]{.underline}**"
[of]{.underline} elite childhoods, elite education, and [elite
culture]{.underline}.30 Consequently, while there are many cases of
elites "canceling" working-class people,31 there are not many cases of
nonelites successfully canceling elites. Even in the cases of "punching
up," [what is characterized as]{.underline} "**[holding the privileged
to account]{.underline}**" [is generally an instance in which some
faction of elites has managed to purge or inflict damage on someone
**even better positioned** than themselves]{.underline}. Much like
cricket or lacrosse in the United States, cancellation is primarily an
elite sport.

For their part, people from less elite backgrounds are generally less
knowledgeable about how to work "the system." They often try to avoid
folding authorities into their problems, because they tend to believe
that doing so would make their problems worse (not wrongly). Indeed,
[[when people from less elite backgrounds try to leverage]{.underline}
"**[accountability]{.underline}**]{.mark}" [resources]{.underline},
[[they]{.mark} are **much less likely** to get the result they
wanted]{.underline}. Rather than the accused being held to account, the
[accusers often [face **retaliation** and]{.mark} other forms of
**[blowback]{.mark}**]{.underline} that, precisely in virtue of their
more tenuous position, people from less elite backgrounds are typically
least capable of weathering. Likewise, when they find themselves targets
of cancellation campaigns, it is people from less advantaged backgrounds
who are least equipped to defend themselves, and who tend to face the
direst consequences. For example, sociologists Frank Dobbin and
Alexandra Kalev have found that when companies institute "grievance
systems" to investigate and prosecute incidents of bias, [racial and
ethnic minorities tend to be the **most adversely
effected**]{.underline}. Asian and African American men, alongside Black
and Hispanic women, become far more likely to get pushed out of
management roles when these policies are implemented. Meanwhile, white
women are among the least affected, and white men tend not to be
affected at all.32

Similar realities hold for censorship. In contemporary symbolic
capitalist spaces, [[**censorious tendencies** are]{.mark} frequently
[justified under]{.mark} the auspices of [protecting vulnerable]{.mark}
and underrepresented [populations]{.mark} from offensive or hateful
speech]{.underline}. [[In **reality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[speech [restrictions]{.mark} generally end up **[enhanci]{.mark}ng**
[the position of the **already powerful**]{.mark} at the expense of the
genuinely marginalized and disadvantaged]{.underline}. Hate speech laws,
for instance, have consistently been turned by ruling parties against
their political and ideological opponents. [They have been regularly
used to justify **surveillance** and **censorship**]{.underline} of
government dissidents [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} advocates for civil
rights and civil liberties. This was true in the civil rights era
(indeed, many free speech protections currently under assault by
mainstream symbolic capitalists were established in the 1960s to protect
civil rights activism from censorship campaigns). This was true with
respect to campaigns for feminism and gay rights. It remains the case
today33---not just in the United States but around the world.34

Academic research and audits by media outlets and government agencies
consistently find that measures to restrict hate speech online [tend to
**[disproportionately silence]{.mark}** racial and ethnic
[minorities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [gender and sexual
minorities]{.underline}, social justice [activists]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} political [dissenters]{.underline}.35 [Outcomes like
[these are **not**]{.mark} unusual]{.underline}
"**[[bugs]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in other wise beneficent and
well-conceived systems. [They are reflections of how censorious
practices **typically play out**]{.underline}: [[they are **almost
invariably** and **necessarily** designed and enforced by people with
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, typically deployed against those with less
power.

#### Making this a voting issue [recreates]{.underline} trauma and violence by substituting [short-term catharsis]{.underline} for transformative justice. The ballot [isn't]{.underline} an accountability measure.

**brown, 20**---writer, activist, and facilitator, former executive
director of the Ruckus Society; citing Ryan Li Dahlstrom, organizer,

Simultaneously [I've watched several public takedowns]{.underline},
[call outs]{.underline}, [and other grievances take place]{.underline}
on social and mainstream media. Some of those have been of strangers,
but recently I've had the experience of seeing people I know and love
targeted and taken down. In most cases, [very [complex realities get
**watered down** into one **flawed aspect**]{.mark} of these people's
personalities]{.underline}, [or one **mistake** or
**misunderstanding**]{.underline}. [A mob mentality takes over
then]{.underline}, [an evisceration of character that is
**punitive**]{.underline}, **[traumatizing]{.underline}**, [and
**isolating**]{.underline}.

This has happened with increasing frequency over the past year, such
that I'm wondering if those of us with an intention of transforming the
world have a common understanding of the kind of justice we want to
practice, now and in the future.

What [we]{.underline} do now is [find out someone]{.underline} or some
group [has done]{.underline} (or may have done) [something **out of
alignment** with our values]{.underline}. Some of the transgressions are
small---saying something fucked-up, being disrespectful in a group
process. Some are massive---false identity, sexual assault.

[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} then [tear that person]{.underline} or group
[to **shreds** in a way that **affirms our values**]{.underline}. We
create memes, reducing someone to the laughing stock of the Internet
that day. We write think-pieces on how we are not like that person, and
obviously wouldn't make the same mistakes they have made. We deconstruct
them as thinkers, activists, groups, bodies, partners, parents,
children---[[find]{.mark}ing all of the [**contradictions** and
**limitations**]{.mark} and shining bright light on them]{.underline}.
When we are satisfied that that person or group is destroyed, we move
on. Or sometimes we just move on because the next scandal has arrived,
the smell of fresh meat overwhelming our interest in finishing the
takedown.

I say "we" and "our" intentionally here. I'm not above this behavior. I
laugh at the memes, I like the apoplectic statuses, the rants with no
named target that very clearly critique a specific person. I've been
examining this---why I can get caught up in a mob on the Internet in a
way I rarely do in life (the positive mob mentality I participate in
for, say, Beyoncé or Björk feels quite different, though I know there is
something in there about belonging...eh, next book). I have noticed that
at the most basic level, [I **feel better** about myself because I'm
**on the right side**]{.underline} of history...or at least the news
cycle.

But lately, as the attacks grow faster and more vicious, I wonder: [is
this what we're here for?]{.underline} [[To cultivate a **fear-based
adherence** to]{.mark} reductive common [values]{.mark}?]{.underline}
[What can this lead to in an **imperfect** world full of
**sloppy**]{.underline}, [**complex** humans?]{.underline} [Is it
possible [we will call each other out until there's **no one left**
beside us]{.mark}?]{.underline}

I've had tons of conversations with [people]{.underline} who, in these
moments of public flaying, [**avoid** stepping up on the side of
**complexity** or **curiosity**]{.underline} because in the back of our
minds is the shared unspoken question: when will y'all come for me?

[[I]{.mark} have]{.underline} also [[had experiences where I]{.mark}
absolutely [wanted to take someone down]{.mark}]{.underline}, expose
them as a liar, cheater, manipulator, assailant. [In **[each]{.mark}**
of these situations]{.underline}, [time]{.underline},
[conversation]{.underline}, [and vulnerability have [created **other
possibilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and I]{.mark} have [ended up
**glad** that I didn't go that route]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which
is]{.mark} generally so [**short-term** in its
impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sometimes this was because transformation
was possible between us. Sometimes this was because the takedown
wouldn't have had the impact I wanted; destroying a person doesn't
destroy all of the systems that allow harmful people to do harm.
[[These]{.mark} takedowns [make it seem as if **massive problems** are
determined at an **individual level**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as if these
individuals set a course as children to become abusers, misogynists,
racists, liars.

How do I hold a systemic analysis and approach when each system I am
critical of is peopled, in part, by the same flawed and complex
individuals that I love? This question always leads me to
self-reflection. If I can see the ways I am perpetuating systemic
oppressions, if I can see where I learned the behavior and how hard it
is to unlearn it, I start to have more humility as I see the messiness
of the communities I am part of, the world I live in.

The places I'm drawn to in movement espouse a desire for
**[[transformative]{.underline}]{.mark}** justice---[[justice]{.mark}
practices]{.underline} that [[go]{.mark} all the way [to the
**root**]{.mark} of the problem and generate solutions and healing
there]{.underline}, [[such that]{.mark} the **[conditions]{.mark}** that
create injustice [are **transformed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A lot of people use these words, and [yet]{.underline}...[we
**don't**]{.underline} really [**know how** to do it]{.underline}.

We call it "transformative justice" when [[we're]{.mark} throwing
**knives** and **insults**]{.underline}, [exposing each other's **worst
mistakes**]{.underline}, [[**reducing** each other to moments of
**failure**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We call it]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[holding each other accountable]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

I recently reposted these words from Ryan Li Dahlstrom, speaking about
this trend in the queer community:

I'm feeling really tired of the call-out culture on social media
especially [[within queer/trans]{.mark} [p]{.mark}eople [o]{.mark}f
[c]{.mark}olor [communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We need to]{.mark}
**center** and **build relationships** with one another and [not keep
**tearing one another down publicly** without]{.mark} trying to have
**[direct conversations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While there are many
places of learning, growth, and contradictory practice within the world
we live in, [why can't we]{.underline} talk to one another directly and
[allow **room for learning** from our mistakes or
differences?]{.underline} [By making these public attacks]{.underline}
on each other, [[we are engaging in the **same disposability
politics**]{.mark} of capitalism and the prison industrial complex that
we purport to be against [while feeding into **state surveillance
tactics** that are **monitoring** how we are tearing each other
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. Enough is enough y'all. We need each other
now more than ever.11

Yes, Ryan Li, I too am tired of it. But I see it everywhere I turn.

[[When the response to mistakes]{.underline}]{.mark},
[failures]{.underline}, [and misunderstandings [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
emotional, psychological, economic, and physical
**[[punishment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[we breed]{.mark} a culture of
**[fear]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[secrecy]{.underline}**, [and
**isolation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### It [turns solvency]{.underline} both in [and]{.underline} out of debate.

**Kaba and Hayes,** **23**---organizer and founder of Project NIA;

Is the Whole World Worth?,"

dml)

[As we work to build more sustainable movements]{.underline}, [we must
think hard about our strategies for responding when organizers make
**mistakes**]{.underline}. Social media can often foster [a]{.underline}
"**[[zero-tolerance]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[attitude]{.mark}
about]{.underline} political ignorance or **[missteps]{.underline}**.
Platforms like Twitter have helped facilitate tremendous accomplishments
in movement work, but they have also [created an arena for political
performance and critique that is often **divorced** from relationship
building or strategic aims]{.underline}. For many people, social media
is not an organizing tool but a realm of political performance and
spectatorship. A trend has emerged in which some [organizers will
[demand]{.mark} performances of [**solidarity** and
**awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline} on social media [[but]{.mark} then
**critique** or even **[tear apart]{.mark}** those [performances when
they **fall short** or are deemed **insincere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
with reality television, [**favorites** emerge]{.underline}, [and people
are]{.underline} sometimes **[voted off]{.underline}** the island.

[[When]{.mark} the performance of solidarity via the replication of [the
**right words**]{.mark}]{.underline} or slogans [[becomes our **central
focus**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it's not surprising that
[[responses]{.mark} might [read as **empty**]{.mark} or even
**insincere**]{.underline}. [[**Sloganizing** is not
**organizing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and paying **righteous [lip
service]{.mark}** to a cause]{.underline}, in the preferred language of
the moment, [**[does not empty]{.mark} any [cages]{.mark}** [or
**transform**]{.mark} **anyone's [material
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Rather than fixating on the
**grammar** of people's politics]{.underline}, [we]{.underline}
organizers [must ask]{.underline} ourselves [what we want people to
**do**]{.underline}.

[When **debates** arise around **language**]{.underline}, [we
must]{.underline} also [understand]{.underline} the extent to which the
[language]{.underline} of dissent and liberation [has
**shifted**]{.underline} over time. [The terms and jargon we use today
do not represent]{.underline} an "arrival" at [the]{.underline}
"**[correct]{.underline}**" [words that were always out
there]{.underline}, [waiting to be found]{.underline}, while our
predecessors flailed about in search of them. The [language we
uplift]{.underline} in movements today [represents an unending process
of **grappling**]{.underline}---[a search for words that embody the
experiences of oppressed people]{.underline} in relation to their
history, their current conditions, and the culture they are presently
experiencing. [**Policing** language]{.underline}, [as though our
phrasing is written in **law**]{.underline}, [**misunderstands** that
pursuit and the purpose it serves]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} these
[words merely exist to **divide** us into
categories]{.underline}---[those who can **properly discuss** ideas and
those who **cannot**]{.underline}---[what is their value in the pursuit
of **liberation**?]{.underline}

[While it is important to trouble terminology]{.underline} and to engage
with its evolution, [the mastery of language does not **spur systemic
change** or **alter anyone's material conditions**]{.underline}. The
concept of "allyship," for example, is often grounded in presentation
rather than substantive action. Similarly, people who believe they are
"good people" often view goodness as a fixed identity, evidenced by
their expressed feelings about injustice rather than a set of practices
or actions. Goodness, to them, is a designation to be defended rather
than something that they seek to generate in the world in concert with
other people. Mainstream liberals often fall prey to this line of
thinking because liberal politics play very heavily into political
identity as being determinant of whether a person is good or bad
(Democrats are good, Republicans bad). But [the left can fall
into]{.underline} its own version of [this **trap** by treating politics
as a test of how well we can **perform language** or **recite
ideas**]{.underline}.

Our [[movements are not driven by **getting the words**]{.mark} **just
right**]{.underline}. [[They are driven by the goal of]{.mark}
**enacting [change through collective struggle]{.mark}** [as we]{.mark}
endeavor to [both **understand** ideas and turn them into
**action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Fumbling is
**inevitable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} as
Gilmore tells us, "**[[practice makes different]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

Dixon emphasizes that [people will show up **imperfectly**
and]{.underline} that [organizers have to anticipate that **mistakes**
and **harm** will happen]{.underline}. "I worry [we're creating a
culture]{.underline} now [where [people are **so afraid** to make
mistakes]{.mark}]{.underline}," she told us. "[They're afraid [to not
have the **analysis** before they open their mouth]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The bonds that I'm really trying to build]{.underline} within
organizing [are the bonds where we can divulge the things that we are
**nervous** about]{.underline}, [or **ashamed** of]{.underline}, [or the
things we need to **learn**]{.underline}, all of those areas, [because
that's when I know we're building the kind of **intimacy** that **takes
care of each other** around heightened threats]{.underline}."

Dixon points out that [[when trust is **lost**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[organizing not only becomes **more difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[but]{.mark} it also becomes [**more vulnerable** to]{.mark}
**surveillance** and **[infiltration]{.mark}**]{.underline}: "[A huge
piece of **COINTELPRO** was around seeding distrust]{.underline}."
Therefore, she says, [[a **key part**]{.mark} of organizing [is]{.mark}
building [bonds of **trust**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and that can
**only** happen]{.underline}]{.mark} [within a context [where people are
allowed to]{.mark} be **vulnerable** and [make
**mistakes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Learning and growing in front of other people can be embarrassing, and
even intimidating, particularly for people who have been put down or
made to feel diminished in the past. Even seasoned organizers like Dixon
often worry about derailing their work with a verbal misstep. "I have a
small crew of other organizers where I think our text thread is mostly
questions we are afraid to ask publicly," she acknowledged. "It's our
own little political education circle, where we ask, 'What does this
mean?' Or, 'Is this fucked up?' Or, 'What is the right way to say this?
Because I don't think this is right.'" Dixon says that she believes
"everyone needs that text thread," but she also hopes that more of our
movement spaces can operate in the same spirit and offer opportunities
for people to "feel safe in their process of transforming."

Creating trust-based movement spaces also puts us in a better place to
confront harm and conflict, Dixon says.

"The biggest part of the work is how we maintain relationships while
navigating harm," she told us. "Because that's the thing, that will
break your group. That'll break any project." Dixon stresses the
importance of conflict resolution and accountability mechanisms within
groups---that is, group- or community-based methods of confronting harm,
such as peace circles and transformative justice. But she also reminds
us that [in order for accountability mechanisms to serve their
purpose]{.underline}, [people need room and opportunities to
**grow**]{.underline}. "[People need to build skills and mechanisms to
**navigate** conflict]{.underline}. Sometimes we're not apologizing.
Sometimes we're not accountable. Sometimes we have done harmful things.
Sometimes we're doing things we were never told go against the norms
\[of the group\] and then are being held accountable."

In an organizing space, [[accountability should not]{.mark} be about
**policing** or **[punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but our punitive
impulses can sometimes **twist** accountability mechanisms into those
shapes]{.underline}. [[It's easy to forget how **imperfectly**
we]{.mark} ourselves [have shown up]{.mark}]{.underline} in movement
spaces and [throughout our lives]{.underline}. Sometimes our aggravation
with others is rooted in pain or trauma we have experienced; sometimes
it is rooted in our uneasiness about things we may have said or done
that were equally upsetting because we did not always know what we know
now. And [regardless of how much we **believe** we have
learned]{.underline}, as the saying goes, [[we **don't know** what we
don't know]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Many]{.underline} of us [would not be
in this]{.underline} work today [if someone along the way had not been
**patient**]{.underline} with us.

[[Even if we never]{.mark} develop]{.underline} a sense of [**mutual
respect** and **understanding**]{.underline}, [or even come to [**like**
the people we're working with]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we can]{.mark}
still [build **power** with them]{.mark}]{.underline}. In many cases,
[we **must**]{.underline}. After all, [[the **whole world** is at
stake]{.underline}]{.mark}. We must ask ourselves, how much discomfort
is the whole world worth?

#### That's net [offense]{.underline}. The easier you [think]{.underline} it is to vote for them, the more it [proves]{.underline} our complacency arguments.

GC: So [[**rather** than a **step** in the right
direction]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it's]{.mark} a way of [**distracting**
from]{.mark} the fact that **[no steps are being
taken]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

JG: I agree with that completely. I think [it illustrates]{.underline}
two factors. One is [the [**turning away** from]{.mark}
**[real]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**actually existing** human
[hardship]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and despair]{.underline} even,
[[to]{.mark} these [**micro-aggressions** and **linguistic
issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which can]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[of
course]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[be **easily
solved**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [the advantage of [focusing **entirely**
on language]{.mark} is that [if you can **gain control** of the
language]{.mark} and make a **simple change**]{.underline} from "master"
to "main," [then [you **think** you've resolved something in the **real
world**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [You've resolved **absolutely nothing** in
the real world]{.underline}; [[the real world **goes on**]{.underline},
[but it **flatters the moral vanity** of those who make these
changes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [They don't have to **sacrifice**
anything]{.underline}; [they don't have to **suffer**]{.underline} in
any way. [And [they don't]{.mark} actually [have to do **anything**
beyond **passing motions**]{.mark} to change these terms]{.underline},
these words. So I think [[it is]{.mark} the [**avoidance** of]{.mark}
very difficult]{.underline} human [misfortunes and]{.underline} in some
cases human [[injustice]{.mark}s [by looking at **signifiers** of
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which can **easily** be
altered]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[even though the world **isn't altered at
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One could even say that [[the world is
**made worse** by these]{.mark} kinds of [**diversionary tactics**
because they **replace**]{.mark} what used to be]{.underline} a
left-wing project (or [a variety of left-wing
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}) [[that **did engage** with]{.mark}
issues]{.underline}, [that was concerned with the powers of trade
unions]{.underline}, [with getting decent housing]{.underline}, [with
providing medical care]{.underline} for people, [and which sometimes
**succeeded**]{.underline} for a while.

I grew up in the northeast of Britain; I was born in 1948, and I grew up
in the 1950s and '60s, which were shaped by the postwar Labour
government, which had brought in a number of sweeping reforms in health
care and schooling and housing, all of which had some negative impacts
but were, on balance, highly beneficial to many people. I remember being
visited at home by a doctor when I had measles as a child, at a time
when Britain was poor, but there was a national health service in which
doctors would come visit your home when called for what would now be
regarded as relatively trivial ailments---or they won't come at all now.
That actually happened.

[The world is **worse** from the **deflection** of energy away from
grappling with [**actual human situations** and their **material
components**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[the]{.mark} availability of
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} for medical [and other
matters]{.underline}---[[and instead]{.mark} moving into the **magical
thinking** which [imagines that a change in **semantics** equals a
change in the **world**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This kind of
movement is politically damaging as well as intellectually worthless.

Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies,

苗

The [history of the Arctic is one of colonization, oppression of
language and culture, exploitation of natural resources, and
depopulation]{.underline}. These issues are largely the result of
decisions made outside the Arctic without the participation or consent
of the people living there and with little regard for the existing
cultural and natural value. [The **future of the Arctic** must be
**driven and guided by young leaders** and **Indigenous peoples** with a
strong connection to the region.]{.underline}

The [most important factor for a better future for the Arctic is to put
**young experts** from the Arctic in **leadership roles** related to the
region]{.underline} and **[include them in the knowledge
creation]{.underline}** that is the basis for decision-making processes.
Re[gional youth collectives in northern Sweden and Norway have
articulated this demand in their visions for the futur]{.underline}e,
see Sweden's Youth 2030 Movement1) and Norway Youth Panel's Arctic White
Paper.2[) Contributions such as these emphasize that youth leadership in
the region can only be achieved by letting young leaders emerge from
Arctic communities]{.underline} and making the Arctic an attractive
place for young people to settle down and live their lives.

is in this context that the 2023 Arctic Policy Hackathon3) -- organized
by The Gordon Foundation, Global Affairs Canada, and the Arctic Mayors'
Forum -- brought together young leaders from Arctic Indigenous and local
communities across northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, Finland,
Norway, and Sápmi/Sweden. We met in Reykjavík to examine how to keep the
next generation of leaders in Arctic communities and produced a set of
policy recommendations.4) Our ideas emerged from conversations with one
another based on our respective experiences across the Arctic. While we
drew inspiration from some localized examples, we set out to create
broad new ideas that could resonate across the region. This article is
my contribution on what it will take to keep the next generation of
leaders in the Arctic, based on the group's policy recommendations.

In the policy recommendations authored by the group of young Arctic
leaders at the Hackathon we attempted to answer these questions through
a set of policy recommendations organized into three themes:

Culture and community

Sustainable development

Holistic wellness

Culture and Community

[Leadership roles in the Arctic must prioritize local youth, Indigenous
people, and minority groups]{.underline}. This requires succession plans
with mentorship and training, reduced credential barriers, and
recognition of local expertise as equal to formal qualifications, as
exemplified by First Alaskans Institute.5) or Aqquimavvik Arviat
Wellness Society.6) [Initiatives such as these work to advance local and
Indigenous]{.underline} [groups in the Arctic through leadership
development, community engagement, and **integration**
**between**]{.underline} **[traditional knowledge and modern
approaches]{.underline}**. Community [development based on
young]{.underline} and Indigenous [expertise]{.underline} with [strong,
local ties]{.underline} to the different regions in the [Arctic is
fundamental in securing inclusive and **representative leadership for
the** **Arctic**.]{.underline}

[Governments, companies, and international entities have huge interests
in the region and their actions can determine the future of thousands of
Indigenous and Arctic people]{.underline}. Many, if not most of these
actors' [**main power centers lie outside the Arctic,** in parliaments,
headquarters, or board rooms]{.underline}. It is important that the
Arctic is a part of the international community[, and **we welcome
cooperation** and **co**-**creation** with these **wielders of
power,**]{.underline} but it [is crucial to ensure the involvement of
the people of the region. Indigenous and Arctic youths must be given
leadership roles within the international entities and companies that
are involved in the development of the Arctic and **co-determination
must be a priority**]{.underline}. These leadership roles could be
achieved through recruitment of young professionals from the region,
establishing local and regional advisory boards or reserving board seats
at the executive level being given to representatives from the
communities.

The [rights of oppressed groups must be a key pillar in the development
of the Arctic]{.underline}. Increasing exposure to diverse populations
and perspectives, through awareness and learning opportunities led by
youth for their community, such [as public awareness campaigns
(2SLGBTQQIA+, gender identity) is vital]{.underline}. Creating more
opportunities for positive interactions will create a sense of safety
and belonging in lives and communities. Additionally, creating safer
spaces will allow for acceptance and inclusion of diverse multicultural
identities, promoting a holistic sense of community that is attractive
and welcoming to all, for instance, Samtökin '78, the National Queer
Association of Iceland has an extensive refugee welcoming program.7)
This [will not only **make the lives of those living in the Arctic
better** but will also **increase the attractiveness of the region** to
young people around the world.]{.underline}

[Sustainable Development]{.underline}

Whereas in the past, the [economic value created in the Arctic was for
the most part dependent on the extraction of natural
resources]{.underline},8) this is **[not sustainable]{.underline}** in
the long run and creates very little lasting value for the communities
in the region.9) [The **Arctic's future** must focus on **exporting
knowledge**, **innovation**, and **expertise** to create enduring value
for its people.]{.underline}

[Arctic-focused research and innovation hubs should be established in
key regions through **public-private partnerships**]{.underline},
**[concentrating on renewable energy technologies]{.underline}**,
**[climate adaptation solutions]{.underline}**, and **[sustainable
fisheries management]{.underline}**. These centers must also [launch
programs]{.underline} to [train local]{.underline} [youth]{.underline}
and [Indigenous people in emerging fields such as green
energy]{.underline}, [digital technology]{.underline}, [and sustainable
agriculture, fostering a skilled and innovative workforce.]{.underline}

[Policies]{.underline} must [ensure a significant portion of
Arctic-based projects are locally owned, **supported by tax incentives
f**]{.underline}or companies that prioritize local shareholders and
**[reinvest profits into communities.]{.underline}** Additionally,
**[grants and low-interest loans]{.underline}** [should be provided to
Indigenous entrepreneurs to develop businesses aligned with Arctic
values]{.underline}, including **[ecotourism]{.underline}**,
**[artisanal crafts]{.underline}**, and **[renewable
energy]{.underline}** **[ventures]{.underline}**, [which will strengthen
local economies]{.underline}. Companies carrying out operations in the
Arctic should be, to a larger degree, required to hire workers locally
and ensure that important positions are held by people who are a part of
the community.10)

[Legislation should mandate that all major Arctic development projects
**publish detailed impact assessments** outlining affected territories,
resources, and communities.]{.underline} **[Regional
councils]{.underline}** comprising local community representatives,
[Indigenous groups, and youth must review and approve these projects to
ensure diverse perspectives guide decisions]{.underline}. Digital
platforms offering real-time updates on project goals and progress will
further enhance public scrutiny and feedback.

A portion of [revenues from Arctic resource **extraction and
development**]{.underline} [projects]{.underline} must be
**[reinvested]{.underline}** into [community infrastructure, education,
and cultural preservation initiatives]{.underline}. Additionally, a
regional investment fund managed by Arctic community representatives
should be established to support long-term projects that align with the
region's sustainable development goals.

By focusing on these **[concrete initiatives]{.underline}**, the [Arctic
can transition to a sustainable economy rooted]{.underline} in
[innovation and inclusivity]{.underline}. Transparent governance, local
empowerment, and strategic investments will ensure the region's growth
benefits its people and preserves its cultural and natural heritage for
future generations.

Holistic Wellness

There is a [lack of accessible, culturally-relevant, and socially
cohesive mental health and medical]{.underline} care [services in the
Arctic, particularly for Indigenous and marginalized
groups]{.underline}.11) This includes critical areas like mental health
support, cultural programs,12) housing assistance, employment aid, and
rehabilitation services.13) To address these gaps, mobile health units
and telemedicine platforms should be deployed to bridge distances in
sparsely populated areas. [Community health initiatives, such as
culturally informed **mental health workshops** and **wellness centers**
led by local practitioners, must be prioritized]{.underline}.
Governments and stakeholders [should provide funding for these services
to ensure they are tailored to the specific needs of Arctic
populations.]{.underline}

The [quality of and access to education (including **cultural ways of
education**]{.underline}) in the Arctic is [limited]{.underline}. This
[leads to people leaving the region to pursue their own
education]{.underline}, or the education of their children.14) To
improve educational outcomes and retention, [Arctic-specific training
programs for educators should be]{.underline} established, [focusing on
cultural safety, anti-racism, ethics, technology,]{.underline} and
[innovative teaching methods.]{.underline} Additionally, creating
partnerships with local communities to develop bilingual and culturally
relevant curricula can help [preserve Indigenous languages and
knowledge]{.underline}. Building satellite schools or offering hybrid
learning options can expand access to education in remote areas.

[**Climate change** poses **severe challenges** to **living sustainably
in the Arctic**,]{.underline} affecting health, safety, and cultural
practices.15) To combat these effects, [**substantial investments**
should be directed toward **community-led adaptation
projects**]{.underline} such as **[sustainable housing
design]{.underline}**s that [withstand harsh climates]{.underline} as
for example has been suggested in Qaanaaq in Greenland and [renewable
energy installations in remote]{.underline} [villages]{.underline}.16)
Establishing [Arctic-led research facilities on **emission reduction**
**and climate resilience**]{.underline} can [position the region as a
global leader in green technology]{.underline}. For example, wind and
solar energy projects tailored for Arctic conditions could reduce
dependency on imported fossil fuels, [while promoting local expertise in
green energy solutions.]{.underline}

The [**development of the Arctic** must honor its natural and cultural
values while creating new opportunities.]{.underline} Community
ownership in **[development projects,]{.underline}** such as [co-managed
renewable energy farms or cultural tourism ventures, can ensure that
benefits remain within the region]{.underline}. Young leaders must play
a central role in these efforts by participating in policy discussions
and contributing to knowledge production. [Initiatives like **leadership
fellowships** and **Indigenous youth councils** should be
**established** to **empower** the **next** **generation** to guide
Arctic policy and innovation.]{.underline}

### Cede the Political---2AC

#### The 1AC's constructivist framing of Indigenous peoples as pacifist and cooperative reinscribes colonial erasure. Embracing political engagement is key for effective Arctic de-colonialism.

**Reid 23** (Julian Reid, a Professor of International Relations at the
University of Lapland, Finland. Previously he taught at King's College
and SOAS (both University of London), as well as Sussex University.

Relations,\" Georgetown Journal of International Affairs,

DOA: 7-15-2025//St. Marks Adam)

Constructivists [often criticize mainstream International Relations (IR)
theories for their colonial approach]{.underline} to the cultures,
knowledge, and agency of Indigenous peoples. Despite their intentions,
[[constructivist]{.underline}]{.mark} [[approaches]{.underline}
[fail]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to]{.mark} [decolonize
IR]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [constructivist]{.underline}
[construction]{.underline} [of Indigenous peoples as embodiments of
non-violence, cooperation, and empathy and as passive victims of
violence should be replaced by a more nuanced approach to the roles of
Indigenous people in war and violence--what we define as "martial
indigeneity."]{.underline}

[Constructivists]{.underline} [wrongly [portray]{.mark} the [Indigenous
as ultrasocial]{.mark} people]{.underline}

[[Many claim]{.underline}]{.mark} that [decolonizing]{.underline}
[International Relations ([IR]{.mark}) [requires moving]{.mark}
[past]{.mark} mainstream theories, especially [realism and
liberalism]{.mark}, which have ignored the effects of colonialism on
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, [excluded their knowledge, and
diminished their political agency because of state-centric assumptions
about "who counts in International Relations." [However,
constructivist]{.mark} [approaches]{.mark} also [reproduce colonial
narratives]{.mark} about Indigenous peoples in IR. This is]{.underline}
particularly [apparent in works about Indigenous war and violence.
Constructivist IR theorists often c[onstruct]{.mark} Indigenous [peoples
as]{.mark} communities [built on pacifist principles]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[non-violence]{.mark}, empathetic dialogue, and cooperation]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} as the [victims of violence]{.mark} rather than the
perpetrators. I argue that decolonizing [IR demands]{.mark} a more
[nuanced understanding of]{.mark} the roles of [war and violence]{.mark}
in Indigenous communities]{.underline}---"martial indigeneity."

[Constructivists argue that "Indigenous politics is driving a
transformational and revolutionary change in the theory and practice of
International Relations."]{.underline} One leading constructivist,
Beverly Crawford, even argues that [Indigenous peoples have prevented
the outbreak of interstate war in the Arctic]{.underline}. [Realism and
liberalism focus exclusively on the agency of states and international
organizations and fail to explain "Arctic peace," Crawford
asserts]{.underline}. According to Crawford, [Indigenous peoples are
"ultrasocial" and characterized by "empathy, cooperation and
other-regarding" capabilities. Without Indigenous ultrasociality and
governance in the Arctic, the Arctic would, she argues, most likely
already have suffered a great power conflict]{.underline}. Therefore,
Crawford believes that safeguarding "Arctic peace" depends on empowering
Indigenous peoples. However, [her constructivist portrayal of the
Indigenous as ultrasocial peoples is **no better** than realist and
liberal **neglect** of Indigenous peoples.]{.underline}

Indigenous peoples are adept at geopolitics and warfare

In his recent book, Indigenous Continent, historian Pekka Hämälainen
provides a detailed account of the military and geopolitical supremacy
that Indigenous peoples achieved across North America during their
17th-century conflicts with European settlers. With the advent of
settler colonialism, Indigenous peoples, such as the Iroquois and the
Sioux, outfought and outmaneuvered colonial forces from Spain, Britain,
France, and the Netherlands, adeptly using geopolitics to their
advantage.

[Indigenous]{.underline} [peoples waged war]{.underline}, however, [not
only against colonizers]{.underline}. The [[Inuit]{.underline} [of
Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} [[waged]{.mark} vicious [wars on]{.mark}
their southern [neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Cree, for hundreds
of years until Cree acquisition of firearms from settlers ended the
series of conflicts. There has been strikingly little 'ultrasociality,'
to use Crawford's essentializing term, in Inuit-Cree relations. The
realities of such violent conflicts between Indigenous peoples undercut
constructivist representations of Indigeneity, which misrepresent the
complexities of Indigenous cultures.

[Western academics may avoid researching Indigenous warfare]{.underline}
[due to the fear that representing Indigenous peoples as violent or
warlike legitimizes colonial narratives. But as the anthropologists
Richard Chacon and Ruben Mendoza highlight, warfare was fundamental to
Indigenous cultures long before contact with Europeans. Indeed, they
claim that denying the prevalence of Indigenous warfare is itself "a
vestige of colonial repression--depriving native warriors of their
history of armed resistance."]{.underline} Indigenous [peoples should be
recognized for their courage and their prowess in fighting to defend
themselves. Contemporary racism denies these capacities.]{.underline}

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(UNDRIP) seeks to protect Indigenous peoples from genocide, ethnocide,
or other acts of violence aimed at their destruction. Article 8 of
UNDRIP that states must prevent the spreading of "propaganda designed to
promote or incite racial or ethnic discrimination directed against \[the
Indigenous[\]." [Ignoring]{.mark} or denying the [existence of
war]{.mark} and violence [in Indigenous cultures **erases**]{.mark}
[elements of those]{.mark} [cultures,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[fostering]{.mark} the **[cultural destruction]{.mark}** that the UN
seeks to prevent]{.underline}.

[[Constructivist constructions]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [Indigenous damage]{.mark} [their interests]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[ability to]{.mark} [deploy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[organized
violence]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [integral to]{.mark} Indigenous abilities
to [defend]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[interests]{.underline}.]{.mark}
A tabletop [exercise conducted in 2018]{.underline} by the RAND
Corporation [cast Indigenous peoples' opposition to exploitation in the
Arctic as a potential "wild card," threatening to derail the
extractivist strategies]{.underline} [of]{.underline} nearby
[states]{.underline}. For example, [o[pposition by the
Saami]{.underline}]{.mark}[, an indigenous group inhabiting northern
Scandinavia and northern Russia, [to mining projects in the Finnish
Arctic]{.mark} has [undermined]{.mark} the state of
Finland's]{.underline} [[attempt to market]{.mark} Arctic
[territories]{.mark} as an attractive site for mining
corporations]{.underline}. A 2021 Fraser Institute report concluded that
many [mining [companies have avoided]{.mark} doing [business]{.mark} in
Finland]{.underline} [[due to conflicts]{.mark} with Saami
communities]{.underline}.

However, [[Indigenous efforts to defend themselves]{.mark} are
[threatened]{.mark} by [IR theorists']{.mark} essentializing
portrayals]{.underline} [of the Indigenous as exemplars of peace,
empathy, and cooperation]{.underline}. Such misrepresentations
[[contribute to]{.mark} the [Indigenous being]{.mark}
[associated]{.mark} only with "[soft politics"]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and excluded]{.mark} [from forums where hard political issues]{.mark}
[are at stake]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO, for instance, has ignored
Indigenous peoples while expanding its presence in the Arctic since the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. This [exclusion can prevent]{.underline}
the [Indigenous from defending their lands]{.underline}. [Military
issues are not recognized as Indigenous issues even when they concern
the occupation of Indigenous lands. As one of the leaders of the
Gwich'in (an indigenous people inhabiting northwestern North America),
Edward Alexander put it recently:]{.underline}

[Hard security issues]{.underline}, whether they NATO or the States, or
Canada, or in Russia---[if it does not include Indigenous people at
those tables, it is going to have negative impacts and implications for
Indigenous people]{.underline}. So, NATO should include us in their
discussions ... NATO should ensure that they have the consent of the
Indigenous people of the Arctic, so things are done in an ethical way,
and also in a way that promotes a better relationship for long-term
security.

The [UN recognizes that [protecting]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Indigenous
rights]{.mark} **[requires policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that
protect]{.mark} Indigenous [lands from
militarization]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [UN [must adhere to
this]{.mark} goal [by empowering]{.mark} [Indigenous communities to
shape hard power]{.mark} [**through** international
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. IR scholars can help this cause by
[embracing martial indigeneity--abandoning the narratives that
incorrectly construct Indigenous peoples as pacific and Indigenous
politics as "soft."]{.underline} Only then can IR move past its long
history of exploitation, exclusion, and discrimination against
Indigenous peoples.

### Engagement=Possible---2AC

#### The Arctic is a site of collaboration, not exclusion, with indigenous people. examples of "arctic exceptionalism" redefines IR.

Studies Center in the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies

As a result of global warming, the Arctic is now a key focus for the
eight Arctic nation-states -- Canada, Russia, Denmark (Greenland), the
United States, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland -- as well as many
non-Arctic states. In fact[, some scholars would argue that since the
Cold War the Arctic has become "the center of world politics" (Heininen
& Southcott, 2010: 4). By 2011, each of the Arctic nations had released
an Arctic or northern dimensions of its foreign policy clearly
illustrating the surge in geopolitical interest in the
region]{.underline}.1 Even the European Union and China are planning to
draft Arctic policies.2 [Although the Arctic was a key geopolitical
focus during the Cold War, the current situation differs in two
important ways. First, the [Arctic nations are]{.mark}, for the most
part, [committed to **collaboration** on]{.mark} issue-resolution and
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Brosnan, Leschine & Miles, 2011;
Heininen, 2011; Heininen & Southcott, 2010; Keskitalo, 2004 & 2007;
Young, 2009 & 2011) [[including **active** **participation** in the
Arctic Council,]{.mark} a high-level intergovernmental forum, created in
1996 to foster Arctic cooperation. Second[, Arctic indigenous peoples
have **mobilized** **politically** and]{.mark} [**effectively** in the
last 30 to 40 years and now play a significant role in]{.mark} [Arctic
policy development]{.mark} [and decision-making at]{.mark} both the
[domestic and international levels]{.mark}]{.underline} (Abele & Rodon,
2007; Griffith, 2011; Koivurova, 2010; Shadian, 2010; Plaut, 2011;
Wilson, 2007; Wilson & Smith, 2011). The **[Arctic has become the
meeting ground for traditional state geopolitics and indigenous
diplomacies]{.underline}**. Heininen & Nicol (2007) call the
geopolitical reality in the Arctic today "some sort of renaissance of
regional co-operation by circumpolar indigenous peoples and civil
societies" (Heininen & Nicol, 2007: 161). [The [combination of a
collaborative approach to geopolitics]{.mark} [combined with the
participation of new actors]{.mark} on the world stage -- actors who
have distinct values and goals that are not nation-state-centered --
[may be contributing to a new approach to international
relations]{.mark} in the Arctic region]{.underline}. [In international
relations theory, [the nation-state has traditionally]{.mark} [been used
as the]{.mark} primary [unit for political analysis]{.mark}. Therefore,
traditional foreign policies reflect the interests of the nation-state
and prioritize national interests over community or individual security
or capacity. The [northern dimensions of foreign policy for the]{.mark}
eight [Arctic nations]{.mark} begin to [diverge from this tradition
**placing**]{.mark} **greater [emphasis on state
collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Heininen, 2011) [[including a
commitment to working closely with Arctic indigenous peoples to
address]{.mark} current and future [challenges to
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, Arctic indigenous
organizations, in particular [[the]{.mark} international Inuit
organization, the Inuit Circumpolar Council [(ICC)]{.mark}3 , are
[**challenging** nation-**state dominance**]{.mark} in international
relations [by reframing the Arctic as a region that transcends]{.mark}
[nation-state borders]{.mark} [and by asserting]{.mark} [their rights as
a people]{.mark}. Even mainstream media have noted the growing influence
of the Inuit]{.underline}. For example, in March 2010 The [Economist
published an article about how [the Inuit are influencing]{.mark}
natural resource [development]{.mark} in the Arctic noting, "although
they are only a small minority -- an estimated 160,000 of them are
spread across the Arctic -- [they have achieved a degree of
power]{.mark}"]{.underline} (para. 4). Parallel efforts are also found
at the national level particularly evident in recent efforts by the
national Inuit association in Canada, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK),
to redraw the map of Canada to ensure all Inuit benefit from domestic
northern policies. Both domestically and internationally Arctic
indigenous peoples are challenging the conventional concepts of
territory in favor of a regional understanding of the Arctic in an
effort to enhance their voice and influence in political affairs.

#### Despite small population sizes, the Inuit have achieved [effective]{.underline} political engagement .

While there are difficulties for most minority groups in the political
realm, those that make up a small portion of the population have a much
more limited range of options for actions to take. For example, the
Mayans who make up a majority have engaged in international appeals in
the past with their advocate Rigoberta Menchú, along with ethnic voting
and local representation. This contrasts with the Inuit who have most of
their accomplishments through direct national or international appeals.
Following this trend, [it appears that smaller communities would be more
prone to choosing international appeals. While [work at the domestic
level]{.mark} [may be difficult]{.mark} for any indigenous group
regardless of population percentage because of discrimination, it is
virtually impossible [for smaller ethnic groups.]{.mark} This is not
because of formal barriers like restrictions of voting rights, but just
based on logistics.]{.underline} [However, **this [does not mean]{.mark}
that the [ways of political engagement]{.mark}** **[used by small
indigenous groups]{.mark} [are any less effective]{.mark}** than methods
of larger groups]{.underline}. While there is not a measure to quantify
effectiveness or success for these different methods in this paper, [the
international appeals that the Inuit favor seem to work
well]{.underline}. Partially [[because of]{.mark} work by [the Inuit,
Canada]{.mark} has [switched its position]{.mark} [from a non-signer of
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations [Declaration on the
Rights]{.mark} [of Indigenous People to supporting the
declaration]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Inuit have [also]{.mark}
successfully [managed to get seats on]{.mark} [international
organizations]{.mark} [and have]{.mark} been [a]{.mark} clear and
[ever-present voice at]{.mark} organizations like [the U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations]{.underline}. In fact, it [could be argued that these
international measures are **more effective** than the domestic means.
Through creating a lot of noise, the Inuit have managed to [represent
themselves on]{.mark} an international panel, [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. While there are still downfalls, such as
they have not secured voting rights in that organization, [the Inuit
still have succeeded in bringing their problems to an international
audience and manage to represent themselves while doing so]{.underline}.
The unfortunate situation is that often, forms of political engagement
only work when it is in the reigning government's interest to grant
rights to the indigenous population. This has often been a second
priority compared to economic or political development and is often used
as a PR stunt. While this reality creates doubt about the benefits of
attempting to fight back and become an advocate, it [still stands that
[any progress]{.mark} the group can make [would be beneficial]{.mark}.
With the use of domestic or international means of political engagement,
governments have a difficult time pushing groups to the side when their
voice is strong]{.underline}. The [benefits of working through domestic
efforts, like the Mayans and Quechua do, is that it is more difficult
for their governments to shut down these efforts without suppressing
democracy. While this has happened before, it calls into question human
rights abuses and creates another range of international problems for
the administrations.]{.underline} [[When groups make]{.mark}
[international appeals]{.mark}, it [brings attention into a
state]{.mark}, [which has resulted in them wavering and granting
requests]{.mark} (Coates & Holroyd, 2014). This has been the [case with
both Mayan and Inuit]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Through any of
these methods of political engagement, indigenous communities are
staring their governments down and demanding change]{.underline}. With
methods like local parties, voting, or international appeals, these
groups have succeeded in creating change to better their political
situation. [The **[best way to succeed is through]{.mark} legitimate,
[political means]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even in situations where
oppression is widespread, or the percentage of population is very low,
these [cases prove that it is possible to use political engagement to
**create** **change**.]{.underline}

Potential of an EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy

[Coloniality]{.underline} in an EU context is [often only understood as
a legacy of the EU Member States]{.underline} while the
**[EU]{.underline}** [itself is **framed** as a post-**colonial**
project]{.underline}. Following Hansen and Jonsson34) though, the EU
needs to address its own colonial legacy and present more critically.
[Although the authors focus on entanglements between the history and
present of EU integration and the African continent]{.underline}, they
still hold an [interesting angle for the case of the Sámi
People]{.underline}. An [EU internal Indigenous Peoples
Policy]{.underline} could [support]{.underline} in **[addressing
colonial legacies]{.underline}** [internally through strengthening
Indigenous Peoples' right to **participate in EU
policy-making**.]{.underline} Early in the policy cycle process, an EU
internal perspective featuring a rightsholder [concept in
consultation]{.underline} and [participation fora]{.underline} could
help to [counter current dynamics of "judge-made law and only applying
law]{.underline}"35) that often only in a last step decide on the
compliance of development projects with national and international law.
Furthermore, setting a rights-based standard and policy framework at the
EU level could [also assist in addressing the issue of capacity on the
side of Sámi organisations]{.underline}. By [including Indigenous
Peoples' representatives]{.underline}, in our case Sámi representatives,
**[early in policy-making processes]{.underline}**36) and by
[**facilitating** meaningful and **rights-based
participation**]{.underline}, policy [outcomes]{.underline} [run less
the risk of being perceived as unjust and can reduce the probability of
cases being brought to court]{.underline}. A relevant angle could be
[setting rights-based standards]{.underline} in an EU internal
Indigenous Peoples Policy on [permitting processes that could be
implemented at the national level]{.underline} to **[better
ensure]{.underline}** [Sámi rights to **self-determination** already at
a higher governance level]{.underline}. For instance, the [EU could
develop targeted guidelines on the implementation of
policies]{.underline} in the field of renewable energy and mining,
stronger safeguards for EU funding and decision-making in the European
Investment Bank and guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessments and
Strategic Environmental Assessments addressing Sámi rights. Moreover,
[the Commission could **establish dialogues** with the Member States to
**raise** **awareness** on **Sámi rights** to land and
resources.]{.underline}

Against the backdrop of insights and experiences from the local,
regional and national level regarding 'dialogues',37) these [dialogues
need to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples as rightsholders
different]{.underline} from [other actors to better protect Indigenous
Peoples' rights to self-determination]{.underline}. Although the EU
neither designs the processes in the national context nor permits
licences, it still has an [agenda-setting power]{.underline} [using
"moral discourses of climate change mitigation]{.underline}"38) through
developing overarching policy frameworks. Thus, applying a rightsholder
[concept]{.underline} in EU policy-making could also [**strengthen**
**Indigenous**]{.underline} [**Peoples'** **rights** throughout the
governance levels]{.underline}, [underlining]{.underline} the relevance
of an [EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy as a
framework.]{.underline}

However, currently the EU policies concerning the Arctic and Indigenous
Peoples cannot achieve their full potential on both the goal of
decarbonisation and on respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
[Through an EU internal policy, **rights cannot only be protected but
can thrive**.]{.underline} Such a [policy cannot only support
rightsholders but also stakeholders,]{.underline} Member States and the
EU in fulfilling the legal commitments and in actually acting on
Indigenous Peoples' rights and knowledge systems. [This also includes
acknowledging that consultations can lead to a decision not to proceed
with development]{.underline} [projects]{.underline}, securing space for
both Indigenous livelihoods and other developments. [EU decisions, even
if]{.underline} [applied nationally, regionally, or locally, strongly
impact the Sámi People]{.underline}. Due to the Sámi's rights, including
the right to self-determination, which need to be ensured by all actors
at different governance levels following inter alia ILO No. 169 and
UNDRIP, not only the nation-states but also the EU needs to consult with
the Sámi People on issues that affect their right to
self-determination[. Current examples from **Sápmi** demonstrate the
**significant impact of EU policies**]{.underline} on [Sámi livelihoods
and the ne**ed to properly protect Sámi rights** to self-determination
under the green transition]{.underline}. **[Sámi
rightsholders]{.underline}** all over Sápmi, whether in Fovsen, Giron or
elsewhere, [could be **better protected** by streamlining Indigenous
Peoples' rights into EU policy-making]{.underline}. However, such an
internal perspective should not be considered a panacea. We understand
it as [a **first** but relevant **step** because it could link existing
policies while stressing a rightsholder concept.]{.underline} An EU
internal Indigenous Peoples policy could also contribute to
**[addressing the EU's colonial legacies]{.underline}** [and design more
meaningful dialogues with Indigenous Peoples beyond the case of the Sámi
people.]{.underline}

Conclusion and Outlook

In this article, we presented the rightsholder concept as a potential
tool to streamline Indigenous Peoples' rights into EU policy-making.
[Court cases and insights from research with Sámi representatives who
participated in consultation processes at lower governance level
s]{.underline}how that the [stakeholder concept applied to participation
does not, in practice, protect the rights of Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}. Sámi representatives do not assess "dialogue"
processes as meaningful, which in many examples leads to so-called
judge-made law when rightsholders go to court. Dialogues remain
superficial, one-sided and often do not take into account Sámi
Indigenous knowledge.

[For nation-states and the EU as a whole, these legal uncertainties can
hamper the implementation of the European Green Deal.]{.underline} For
the Sámi People, [these legal means are linked to long processes that
decide if and how Sámi rightsholders can continue with their traditional
livelihoods]{.underline}. We identify an **[EU internal Indigenous
Peoples Policy]{.underline}** as [relevant for applying a rightsholder
concept in consultations]{.underline} and other forms of participation
at the EU level. It [would help the EU to **address** its **colonial**
**legacies** and could even **influence** through its framework setting
power other governance levels]{.underline} by establishing rights-based
standards at the EU level. [Ultimately, it **is in all actors'
interests** to ensure such legal certainty and follow laws protecting
Indigenous Peoples' rights to self-determination]{.underline}. An [EU
internal Indigenous Peoples Policy could **facilitate more just** and
sustainable **policy outcomes.**]{.underline}
