Practical arguments

[[If DoD]{.mark} were to consider [acquiring]{.mark} a fleet of
[SMRs]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it would start by]{.underline} assessing
its need for them and [identifying]{.underline} the [key mission
performance parameters]{.underline} [they would need to
satisfy]{.underline}. DoD manages the development of new programs
through its Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, which
starts by identifying either new threats or gaps in current
capabilities. [Assuming a valid gap is identified]{.underline}, the
[process]{.underline} then [moves through material
solutions]{.underline} analysis---essentially [looking at all possible
alternatives]{.underline} to fill that gap. [[There is little
evidence]{.mark} that the [SMR designs that would emerge]{.mark} from
this]{.underline} analytic [process [would be appropriate for]{.mark}
wide [commercial deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact,
[most]{.underline} of the [[evidence suggests]{.mark} **quite** [the
**opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[operational requirements]{.mark} and performance standards that
would be critical [in a]{.mark} v[SMR]{.mark} [slated for use in forward
operating bases would]{.mark}]{.underline} most likely
[[yield]{.underline} [a very small reactor]{.underline}]{.mark}
(nominally less than 10 megawatts of electricity), [[blunting]{.mark}
its broad **[commercial desirability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition
to their small size, these [reactors would likely be developed
with]{.underline} other [[characteristics]{.mark} that may [prove
**troublesome** for]{.mark} commercial [**industry** or **regulatory
bodies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, [they would need to have a **long
core** life]{.underline}, which means they would require fuel
"**[enriched]{.underline}**" with **[uranium-235]{.underline}** to a
higher level than used in commercial reactors. Second, [they would have
to be transportable and thus rugged]{.underline}. [Third]{.underline},
for [variants]{.underline} that are [small enough to be
deployed]{.underline} [in]{.underline} remote or forward operating
[bases]{.underline}, the [design [might]{.mark} have to [employ very
**modest** **containment structures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fourth, they
would be designed to absorb shocks and to continue operating in spite of
these. Fifth, control [systems would]{.underline} most likely [have to
be automated to a great degree]{.underline}, because it costs money to
train personnel, and [[DoD would **not look kindly** on SMRs that
turn]{.mark} forward operating [**bases** into **superbly guarded power
plants**]{.mark}]{.underline} that have more plant operators than
warfighters.

Though SMRs designed to provide power to US military bases could be
larger, [it is likely that [DoD]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[want **substantially different**
tech]{.mark}nical [specifications from]{.mark} those of **[commercial
reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As with vSMR variants, sound arguments
can be made for more highly enriched cores to lengthen refueling
intervals, greater ruggedness to support defense and security
resilience, and robust standalone control systems to limit vulnerability
to cyber and physical risks.

The characteristics outlined above would most likely be endorsed by many
reactor designers, and [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} experts [have [called
for DoD to be an early leader]{.mark} to ensure technical
specifications]{.underline} such as these [are tailored to meet unique
DoD requirements]{.underline}. [[But it is difficult to overstate how
**politically unpalatable**]{.mark} some]{.underline} of them [[would
be]{.mark} to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission]{.underline}. This is
especially true of any move toward higher fuel enrichment. Should they
be incorporated into one system, [we have [great difficulty
envisioning]{.mark} a [license]{.mark} being granted [without
**institutional reforms**]{.mark} so deep that they would be sufficient
to enhance nuclear power's prospects on their own, [weakening]{.mark}
the [case for the **military's involvement**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of
course, since DoD regulates its own reactors, it would not have to deal
with these institutional constraints. However, [the argument that [its
role as **first mover**]{.mark} could accelerate the commercial
licensing process [is **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} very
**[[compelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Moreover, [[any SMR fit for DoD's needs would]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[be **too expensive** for a commercial utility to
deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}. As noted above, [the [same
**requirements**]{.mark} and standards on [which **DoD would
insist**]{.mark} might [render commercial variants **economically
uncompetitive**]{.mark}]{.underline} in most of today's markets. [In
fact]{.underline}, the [military variant itself might not be deployed
widely]{.underline}: [even if]{.underline} the [political will did
materialize]{.underline}, and substantial appropriations were
forthcoming, and industry eagerly participated, [the [likelihood of
**successful project** execution is still
**modest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the [long history of cost
overruns and waste in defense acquisition]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [[**empirical record** is]{.mark} now [so robust that
this statement is]{.mark} almost **[axiomatic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### The AFF constructs a [military-industrial complex]{.underline} entirely reliant on the DoD

[[Should]{.underline}]{.mark} a fleet of [[SMRs]{.mark} developed by DoD
[somehow]{.mark}]{.underline} [[succeed]{.mark} in]{.underline}
fulfilling its ([poorly defined]{.underline}) [mission]{.underline}, and
should it succeed in spawning a following within Congress, [another
prosaic question]{.underline}---that [of **intellectual property**
ownership and **program management**]{.underline}---[would
emerge]{.underline}. Once DoD had deployed several dozen SMRs, and once
the infrastructure that supports these SMRs was developed, even
following a "fee for service" model, the [military might consider
bringing the entire enterprise in-house]{.underline}. This would
effectively create another Naval Reactors program and [would surely
**engender strong opposition**]{.underline}. Given the [contentious
nature of budget battles across the services]{.underline}, the [military
does not need **additional fiefdoms**]{.underline}. The creation of
[Naval Reactors was]{.underline} initially [**highly controversial**,
and [any SMR fleet]{.mark} that relied extensively on DoD]{.underline}
development and [[deployment would **undoubtedly** create
another]{.mark} such **[mini-empire]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For such a
[program]{.underline} not to [[devolve into a
**fiasco**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a similarly vigorous level of project
management, situational awareness, and [**political lobbying** would be
**required**]{.underline}. Military organizations that have been created
to address more critical warfighting needs, such as the Joint Improvised
Explosive Device Defeat Organization, grew far beyond their original
mandate and expected scope. [[If commercial development **lags** or
**fails**]{.mark} to materialize]{.underline}, there is also the [[very
real possibility of]{.underline}]{.mark} developing another [[industrial
base]{.mark} component]{.underline} that is [[**entirely reliant** on
the **military**]{.mark} for support]{.underline}, much like
shipbuilding. [Parts]{.underline} of the military-industrial complex
[already [resemble a **monopsony**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with programs
maintained to support the nation's industrial base despite often-limited
warfighting impact: the controversy surrounding the [USS Zumwalt-class
guided-missile destroyer]{.underline}, which many critics have [called a
**boondoggle**, serves as a prime example]{.underline}.

#### Maintaining a [firewall]{.underline} between [civilian]{.underline} and [military]{.underline} nuclear power is key to [industry success]{.underline} and [military superiority]{.underline}. Erosion [collapses]{.underline} the industry AND kills US credibility in norms setting.

Often, both **[advocates]{.underline}** and critics [of nuclear power
note that the [**firebreak** between]{.mark} the [**civilian** and
**military nuclear programs**]{.mark} is artificial]{.underline}. But
[no matter how]{.underline} [imprecise or imperfect, this firebreak [has
**substantial normative** value]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
[[ensures]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**power** and **weapons** remain
**separate**]{.mark} enough [for **evolutions**]{.mark} in the latter
not [to **compromise** or **cloud the future** of the
former]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Maintaining [this separation is]{.mark}
perhaps the easiest way to **[guarantee]{.mark}** that
[US]{.mark}]{.underline}-made [**[SMRs]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}
**[exportable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[while ensuring]{.mark} that
qualitative [US **military superiority**]{.mark}]{.underline} in reactor
development is maintained. Also, [[if the boundary were
**eroded**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it would make it]{.mark} far more
[**difficult** for the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
**restore** its **standing** with respect to **international controls**
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the development and use of civilian [[nuclear
power]{.underline}]{.mark} and fuel cycles.

#### The AFF [kills]{.underline} credibility of the technology -- amounts to an [admission of failure]{.underline}. Plan doesn't solve\-\--problems are fundamentally [political]{.underline} AND [economic]{.underline}.

Finally, [[adopting this model would **amount** to **an admission of
failure** on the]{.mark} nuclear [industry's part]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Defaulting to]{.underline} the **[national security
argument]{.underline}** in an effort [to [**salvage** the **commercial
nuclear** ]{.mark}**industry** **[concedes]{.mark}** the [**failure**
of]{.mark} the technical and economic arguments in favor of **[the
tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}. The [[nuclear]{.mark} energy
enterprise [is at a **critical juncture**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [its
[problems are **unlikely** to **abate**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near
future, [and [most]{.mark}]{.underline} of these [[are **fundamentally
economic** and **political**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The deregulation of
the electricity markets has yielded utilities that focus on short-term
profits and neglect long-term, structural challenges. [Every
[lender]{.mark}]{.underline} with the assets to finance generation
expansion [is similarly [preoccupied with **short-term
profits**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [US [**energy markets** remain
**warped**]{.mark}]{.underline}: where [[policies]{.mark}
favor]{.underline} [low-carbon power]{.underline}, they [**often
[exclude]{.mark}** [nuclear]{.mark} technologies]{.underline}. These are
profound problems that deserve attention, and fixing them will benefit
nuclear power, the nation, and the climate.

### Solvency\-\--No Adoption\-\--1NC

#### No SMR adoption\-\--they're [unproven]{.underline}, [unprofitable]{.underline}, and are [heavily regulated]{.underline}.

Of course, first-of-a-kind [[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[going to be
**expensive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They will [likely [cost more per
megawatt]{.mark}]{.underline} hour (MWh) than [**existing** large
reactors]{.underline}, and [**certainly** more [than **competing
fuels**]{.mark}]{.underline} (solar, wind, and natural gas). Expensive
new technologies that will [take a **decade** or more]{.underline} to
reach scale (if they ever do) are very high risk, and SMRs face four
distinct kinds of risk:

[Technology risks]{.underline}. Until the reactors are up and running,
[we [won't know]{.mark}]{.underline} whether in practice [[they
meet]{.mark} the [**anticipated** specs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because we
[don't have operational **experience**]{.underline} yet,
[[SMR]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [[could fail]{.mark} to
translate]{.underline} from the drawing board on pilot projects to full
commercial operation in multiple ways---they [could [generate **less**
power]{.mark}]{.underline}, use [[more **fuel**]{.underline}]{.mark},
require [[more **downtime**]{.underline}]{.mark}; there is a [**long
list** of things that could go wrong]{.underline}.

[Market risks]{.underline}. [SMRs]{.underline} as a
[[business]{.underline}]{.mark} face [[risks]{.mark} on
[both]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[supply]{.underline}]{.mark}** side
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**demand** side]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Aside from the technical risks, SMR companies may find that the
[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[more **intense** or
**effective**]{.mark} than anticipated]{.underline}; that some
[assumptions about]{.underline} their [supply chain are
wrong]{.underline}; or even that key [[patents don't hold
up]{.underline}]{.mark}. And of course---as with large
reactors---companies may simply find that [producing and
siting]{.underline} SMRs is much [more expensive]{.underline} than
expected, or takes much longer, or that interest rates shift sharply
upward, or indeed that inflation suddenly hits key inputs. On the demand
side, it may be that [[expected markets]{.underline}]{.mark} simply
[[don't materialize]{.underline}]{.mark}, or that there is [no market
for SMR energy]{.underline} at the price it needs to charge. It's hard
to predict energy markets a decade out.

[Regulatory risks]{.underline}. SMRs [[must
navigate]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple **[[layers of
regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They [[need]{.mark} to
get]{.underline} their [[designs **certified**]{.underline}]{.mark} for
safety (in the United States, [by the]{.underline} Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ([NRC]{.underline})). They need to get NRC safety [approval
for]{.underline} their [operating plan for a specific site]{.underline}.
They then need to get site approval via the National Environmental
Protection Act (NEPA) process to ensure that environmental issues have
been addressed. That may well also involve a defense against NIMBY ("not
in my backyard") lawsuits. And as SMRs will need to scale globally, they
will [also [need to address regulators in **other
countries**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### There are a [litany]{.underline} of more profitable energy sources.

**Gaster '25** \[Robin; April 14; PhD in Economics from UC Berkeley,

University, "Small Modular Reactors: A Realist Approach to the Future of
Nuclear Power,"
https://itif.org/publications/2025/04/14/small-modular-reactors-a-realist-approach-to-the-future-of-nuclear-power/\]

**[Beyond costs]{.underline}**, competitive energy
[technologies]{.underline} offer a [**[different]{.mark}** supply-side
[challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the United States, that
[competition]{.underline} comes from [multiple directions:]{.underline}

**[[Gas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Natural gas is [[by
far]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cheapest source]{.mark} of]{.underline}
firm 24/7 [power]{.underline} in the United States. It's [relatively
[**quick** and **simple** to build]{.mark}]{.underline} more CCGT and
peaker plants, and [natural gas is almost **ubiquitous**]{.underline}.
However, this is largely a U.S. phenomenon. Europe is suffering because
gas is expensive and it is largely dependent on flows from Russia. The
latter may be mitigated by more liquefied natural gas imports,
especially from the United States, but those won't be cheap.

**[Coal]{.underline}**. While [[coal is **cheap**]{.underline}]{.mark},
it is clearly on the way out---but only in the United States and perhaps
Europe. [Germany]{.underline} is [turning to coal]{.underline} for
dispatchable power when its wind-based generation fails. In
[India]{.underline} and [China]{.underline}, coal [use is [growing
**rapidly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and remains the [[**cheapest** form
of]{.mark} [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}---and hence the [most formidable
competitor]{.underline}---in much of the developing world.

[**[Large]{.mark}** nuclear [reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's
possible that, in the end, [[SMRs won't have]{.underline}]{.mark}
significant [[cost advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} over large reactors.
Big reactors do have economies of scale [[in site
**construction**]{.mark} and [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those
could perhaps [more than balance out reactor cost]{.underline}
advantage[s]{.underline} for SMRs, even if cheaper factory-built
reactors become a reality.

Other clean energy. **[[Wind]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[solar]{.underline}]{.mark}** are widely expected to [[eventually
**dominate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[energy]{.mark}
matrix]{.underline}. While their total system costs must include
[[necessary storage]{.underline}]{.mark} and [often [new
transmission]{.mark}]{.underline} (both costs that are often ignored by
wind and solar enthusiasts), [energy]{.underline} from wind and solar
[is]{.underline} cheap [now]{.underline}, and [[getting
**cheaper**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[New technologies]{.underline}**. There are [[promising new
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} on the horizon [that [could provide
firm]{.mark}]{.underline} dispatchable [[energy]{.underline}]{.mark},
notably **[[geothermal]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[fusion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Geothermal could become [important
within a decade]{.underline}, if the initial results from Fervo prove
out.

Transmission. If out-of-area energy from across the grid became cheaper
and more available, the need for localized firm power would decline,
reducing the market incentives for SMRs.

**[[Batteries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Similarly, continued [**rapid**
[cost declines]{.mark}]{.underline} and [**capacity growth** for
batteries]{.underline}---perhaps especially in combination with improved
transmission---might [also [make SMRs **less**
competitive]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**[s]{.mark}**mall **[m]{.mark}**odular **[r]{.mark}**eactor [track
record]{.mark}]{.underline} so far [[points to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
same kind of **[[dismal economic failure]{.underline}]{.mark}** as for
their larger cousins.

The [[US E]{.mark}nergy [D]{.mark}epartment [has been pursuing
s]{.mark}mall [m]{.mark}odular [r]{.mark}eactor[s]{.mark}
[since]{.mark}]{.underline} the last century. In
**[[2000]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the US Congress provided funding "to
undertake a study to determine the feasibility of and issues associated
with the deployment of... small reactors" (Department of Energy 2001,
1; *Congressional Record* 2001). The Energy Department's Office of
Nuclear Energy 2001 report reviewed nearly ten designs and concluded
that "the most technically mature small modular reactor (SMR) designs
and concepts have the potential to be economical and could be made
available for deployment before the end of the decade, provided that
certain technical and licensing issues are addressed" (Department of
Energy 2001, iii).

The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been similarly optimistic. In
October 2008, it projected that the certification review for the NuScale
design would be completed by 2015. It estimated that it would also
complete reviews for other designs, including the Pebble Bed Modular
Reactor and the Hyperion reactor (currently Gen4 Energy) in the same
time frame (Baker 2008). None of that happened.

These [[rosy predictions **failed to materialize** despite]{.mark}
substantial [government support]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the early
2010s, the [[Energy Department supported two]{.mark} small modular
reactor [designs]{.mark}]{.underline}: mPower by Babcock & Wilcox and
NuScale. [[The first]{.mark} of these [was]{.mark} a **[complete
failure]{.mark};**]{.underline} after [years of trying to get investors
and funding]{.underline}, the mPower [program was
terminated]{.underline} (Downey 2015; Adams 2017).

NuScale, [[another recipient]{.mark} of government
largesse]{.underline}, has fared a little better. But the [earliest
official projected [deployment date is]{.mark}]{.underline} now [2029 or
2030]{.underline}---more than a decade later than the Energy
Department's estimate. Even [that date is [**highly uncertain**
because]{.mark}]{.underline} the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's
Advisory [Committee on Reactor Safeguards]{.underline} has [identified
**[serious safety concerns]{.mark}** that will [have to be
addressed]{.mark}]{.underline} before any utility applies for permission
to construct a small modular reactor (Advisory Committee on Reactor
Safeguards 2020b; 2020a; NRC 2020). Significantly, a central concern
involves the steam generator, which, as noted above, is inside the
reactor vessel and a potential source of operational and economic
problems.

#### 2. [REGS]{.underline}.

**Makhajani '21** \[Arjun, M.V. Ramana; July 21; Arjun Makhaljani is a

https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-07/can-small-modular-reactors-help-mitigate-climate-change/\]

[[New designs]{.mark} will [mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that the process
of [getting [safety approvals]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}will likely
[[**take longer** and be **more expensive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
many cases, [[even setting up]{.mark} sound [certification]{.mark}
process [will take **years**]{.mark},]{.underline} since the [safety and
accident modes differ with **each basic design**]{.underline}. For
instance, one risk with high-temperature gas-graphite reactors is fires
rather than meltdowns.

[To give a sense of financial scale]{.underline}, the development of the
[[NuScale]{.mark} [s]{.mark}]{.underline}mall
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}odular [[r]{.underline}]{.mark}eactor, which is
the familiar light water design, is [[expected to cost]{.mark} roughly
\$[**1.5 billion** for]{.mark}]{.underline} development and
[[certification]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hopkins 2020; Chaffee 2020).
[Completely [new]{.mark} non-light water reactor
[designs]{.mark}]{.underline} envisioned by some small modular reactor
developers [[will]{.mark} very likely [**cost even more** and
take]{.mark} **even [longer]{.mark}** [to translate]{.mark}]{.underline}
from the conceptual stage to designs licensed for construction.

Finally, [[s]{.underline}]{.mark}mall [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}odular
[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}eactor[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, like their
larger counterparts, will [also [produce
**radioactive**]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[waste]{.mark}s; [many
will produce more]{.mark}]{.underline} per unit of [power generated [for
**technical** and **economic** reasons]{.mark}]{.underline} (Glaser,
Hopkins, and Ramana 2013; Brown, Worrall, and Todosow 2017; Krall 2020).
The [US government]{.underline} is already [[pay]{.mark}ing [**billions
of dollars** in fines]{.mark}]{.underline} for [not
fulfilling]{.underline} its [contractual obligations]{.underline} to
take possession of spent fuel from existing reactors. The legislative
plan in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act was for a deep geologic
disposal repository to open in 1998. All of the plans in that act have
come to naught after nearly four decades of effort.

[[Waste is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a problem
for]{.underline}]{.mark} non-light water [[reactor
designs]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many sodium-cooled reactors, for example,
use metallic sodium fuel that cannot be disposed of in geological
repositories without extensive processing (Krall and MacFarlane 2018).
Waste from molten salt reactors will be highly radioactive due to
fission products that were not vented in the off-gas and will include
halides like uranium tetrafluoride. If such waste forms are buried as
without processing, and  they interact with water, they would produce
corrosive hydrofluoric acid (Krall and MacFarlane 2018). Therefore,
[[they would need to be processed **before
disposal**]{.underline}]{.mark} using [processes [that will be
**costly** and **complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}; moreover, such
[[processing has **never been carried out** at
scale.]{.underline}]{.mark}

One **[economic problem]{.underline}** with [[s]{.mark}mall
[m]{.mark}odular [r]{.mark}eactors]{.underline} arises from the very
concept. This was [made clear]{.underline} by the developers of the
STAR-H2 design who pointed out [that "the [business risk]{.mark} [would
be transferred]{.mark}]{.underline} predominately [[to the
**supplier**]{.underline}]{.mark} who [must initially emplace a large
factory]{.underline} for economy of mass production fabrication" and
''\[a\] [[supplier would have to foresee]{.mark} a [sufficient
market]{.mark}]{.underline} to invest in factories large enough [to
achieve economy of mass production]{.underline} from production runs of
many hundreds of turnkey plants''  (IAEA 2007, 688). But [[electricity
demand **projections are difficult**]{.mark}; demand has
been]{.underline} consistently [overestimated since the 1970s. [That is

One noteworthy problem with small modular reactors is related to the
supply chain. A mistake for a large reactor affects the utility that
made the error. Significant errors in grid-level projections needed to
generate a large enough order book and sustain the supply chain, would
mean skyrocketing costs for all customers or losses for suppliers---or
both.

Even casual followers of energy and climate issues have probably heard
about [the [**alleged wonders** of]{.mark} small modular nuclear
reactors]{.underline} [([SMRs]{.mark}).]{.underline} This is due in no
small part to the "nuclear bros": an active and seemingly tireless group
of nuclear power advocates who dominate social media discussions on
energy by promoting SMRs and other "advanced" nuclear technologies as
the only real solution for the climate crisis. But as I showed in my
2013 and 2021 reports, the hype surrounding SMRs [is]{.underline} way
**[[overblown]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and my conclusions remain valid
today.

Unfortunately, [much of this SMR happy talk is [rooted in
**misinformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which always brings me back to
the same question: If the nuclear bros have such a great SMR story to
tell, why do they have to exaggerate so much?

What are SMRs?

SMRs are nuclear reactors that are "small" (defined as 300 megawatts of
electrical power or less), can be largely assembled in a centralized
facility, and would be installed in a modular fashion at power
generation sites. Some proposed SMRs are so tiny (20 megawatts or less)
that they are called "micro" reactors. SMRs are distinct from today's
conventional nuclear plants, which are typically around 1,000 megawatts
and were largely custom-built. Some SMR designs, such as NuScale, are
modified versions of operating water-cooled reactors, while others are
radically different designs that use coolants other than water, such as
liquid sodium, helium gas, or even molten salts.

To date, however, [[theoretical interest in SMRs]{.mark} has [not
translated into]{.mark}]{.underline} many [[actual
reactor]{.underline}]{.mark} orders. [The only SMR]{.underline}
currently under construction [is in China]{.underline}. And [in the
United States, only one company]{.underline}---TerraPower, founded by
Microsoft's Bill Gates---[has applied to]{.underline} the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to [build a power
reactor]{.underline} (but at 345 megawatts, [it technically
isn't]{.underline} even [an SMR).]{.underline}

The nuclear industry has pinned its hopes on SMRs primarily because some
recent large reactor projects, including Vogtle units 3 and 4 in the
state of Georgia, have taken far longer to build and cost far more than
originally projected. The failure of these projects to come in on time
and under budget undermines arguments that modern nuclear power plants
can overcome the problems that have plagued the nuclear industry in the
past.

Developers in the industry and the US Department of Energy say that SMRs
can be less costly and quicker to build than large reactors and that
their modular nature makes it easier to balance power supply and demand.
They also argue that reactors in a variety of sizes would be useful for
a range of applications beyond grid-scale electrical power, including
providing process heat to industrial plants and power to data centers,
cryptocurrency mining operations, petrochemical production, and even
electrical vehicle charging stations.

[Here are five facts about SMRs]{.underline} that [the nuclear industry
and the "**nuclear bros**]{.underline}" who push its message [don't
want]{.underline} you, [the public, to know.]{.underline}

1\. [[SMRs are **not**]{.mark} **more [economical]{.mark}** than large
reactors]{.underline}.

[[In theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, [small reactors [should have
lower]{.mark} capital [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} and construction times
than large reactors of similar design [so that utilities]{.underline}
(or other users) [can get financing]{.underline} more [cheaply and
deploy them]{.underline} more [flexibly]{.underline}. But [that doesn't
mean small reactors will be more]{.underline} [economical]{.underline}
than large ones. In fact, the [**[opposite]{.mark}** usually will be
[true]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What matters more [when
comparing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[economics of different power
sources]{.mark} is the cost to produce]{.underline} a [kilowatt-hour of
electricity, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [that depends on]{.underline} the
capital cost per kilowatt of generating capacity, as well as the costs
of operations, maintenance, fuel, and [other factors]{.underline}.

[According to]{.underline} the **[[economies of
scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** principle, [[smaller reactors]{.mark}
will]{.underline} in general [[produce **more expensive
electricity**]{.mark} than larger ones]{.underline}. For example, [the
**now-cancelled** project]{.underline} by NuScale to [build a
460-megawatt, 6-unit [SMR]{.mark}]{.underline} in Idaho [was estimated
to [cost]{.mark} over]{.underline} [\$20,000 per kilowatt]{.underline},
which is [**[greater than]{.mark} the actual [cost]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
the Vogtle [large reactor project]{.mark}]{.underline} of over \$15,000
per kilowatt. This cost penalty can be offset only by radical changes in
the way reactors are designed, built, and operated.

For example, [[SMR developers claim they]{.mark}]{.underline} can [slash
capital cost]{.underline} per kilowatt [by [achiev]{.mark}ing
[efficiency]{.mark} through]{.underline} the [mass
production]{.underline} of identical units in factories. [However,
[**studies** find]{.mark}]{.underline} that such [[cost
reductions]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [would **[not exceed]{.mark}
about [30%]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In addition, [[dozens of
units]{.mark} would [have to be]{.mark} [produced before
manufacturers]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[learn how to
make]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[processes]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[efficient]{.mark} and]{.underline} [achieve]{.underline} those capital
[cost reductions, meaning]{.underline} that the [[first
reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} of a given design [will be [unavoidably
expensive]{.mark}]{.underline} and will [[require]{.underline} [large
**government**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**or ratepayer [subsidies]{.mark}**
to get built]{.underline}. Getting past this obstacle has proven to be
one of the main impediments to SMR deployment.

[Another way]{.underline} that [[SMR developers]{.mark} try to
[reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} capital [[cost]{.mark} is [by]{.mark}
reducing]{.underline} [or **[eliminating]{.mark}**]{.underline} many of
the [**[safety features]{.mark}** required for operating reactors [that
provide]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple layers of
[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as]{.underline} a robust,
[reinforced concrete containment structure]{.underline}, motor-driven
[emergency pumps]{.underline}, and rigorous quality assurance standards
for backup safety equipment such as power supplies. But these changes so
far haven't had much of an impact on the overall cost---just look at
NuScale.

SMRs so far? Shut down

[The **history of small reactors** is a **history of failure**. The U.S.
Army built and operated eight small reactors beginning in the 1950s, but
they proved **unreliable** and **expensive** and the program was **shut
down** in 1977. In addition, 17 small civilian reactors were built in
the US in the 1950s and 1960s, but all have since shut
down.]{.underline}

[Twenty-six small]{.underline} Magnox [reactors were built in the
**U.K.** but all]{.underline} have [**shut down** and **no more will be
built**]{.underline}. The only operating Magnox is a mini-Magnox in
North Korea: the design was made public at an Atoms for Peace conference
and North Korea uses its 5 MW Magnox to produce plutonium for nuclear
weapons.

[India operates 14 small pressurized heavy water reactors, each with a
capacity of about 200 MW]{.underline}. Professor M.V. Ramana noted in
his 2012 book, "The Power of Promise: Examining Nuclear Energy in
India," that [despite a standardized approach to designing, constructing
and operating these reactors, many **suffered cost overruns** and
**lengthy delays**. There are **no plans to build more** of these small
reactors **in India**.]{.underline}

[Nuclear power's share of global electricity generation has **nearly
halved** from **17.5%** in 1996 to **9.2%** now]{.underline}

[Elsewhere, the history of small reactors is just as **underwhelming**.
This includes three small reactors in Canada (all shut down), six in
France (all shut down) and four in Japan (all shut down).]{.underline}

Ramana concludes his history of small reactors with this downbeat
assessment: "Without exception, [**small reactors cost too** much for
the **little electricity they produce**, the result of both their **low
output** and their **poor performance."**]{.underline}

[Just two SMR plants are said to be operating]{.underline} -- [neither
meeting the "modular" definition of serial factory production of reactor
components]{.underline}. [These so-called SMRs exhibit familiar problems
of **massive cost blowouts** and **multi-year delays.**]{.underline}

[The **construction cost** of Russia's floating twin-reactor plant
**increased six-fold** and]{.underline} the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency
estimates that the [electricity]{.underline} it produces [costs
**\$200**]{.underline} per megawatt-hour (**[MWh]{.underline}**). The
reactor is used to power fossil fuel mining operations in the Arctic.

[The other operating SMR]{.underline} -- loosely defined -- [is China's
demonstration twin-reactor]{.underline} high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor (HTGR). The World Nuclear Association states that [the cost of
the demonstration HTGR was **\$6,000 per kilowatt**, **three times
higher** than early cost estimates and **two to three times higher**
than the cost of China's larger Hualong reactors per
kilowatt.]{.underline}

NucNet reported in 2020 that China dropped plans to manufacture 20 HTGRs
after levelised [cost estimates **rose to levels higher than
conventional large reactors**]{.underline}. Likewise, the World Nuclear
Association states that plans for 18 additional HTGRs at the same site
as the demonstration HTGR have been "dropped". [China's demonstration
HTGR demonstrates yet again that the **economics of small reactors
doesn't stack up**.]{.underline}

[Three SMRs are under construction -- again with the qualification that
there's **nothing 'modular'** about these projects.]{.underline}

[Argentina's]{.underline} CAREM [reactor has been a
**disaster**]{.underline}. [Construction began in 2014 and the National
Atomic Energy Commission now hopes to complete the reactor in
2027]{.underline} ‒ [nearly **50 years** after the project was
conceived. The cost estimate]{.underline} in 2021 [was **\$750 million
for a reactor** with a capacity of just **32 MW**.]{.underline} [That's
a **huge expense for a reactor** with the capacity of a handful of large
wind turbines.]{.underline}

In 2021, [China began construction of a]{.underline} 125 MW [pressurized
water reactor]{.underline}. According to China National Nuclear
Corporation, [construction costs per kilowatt will be **twice the cost
of large reactors**, and levelised costs will be **50% higher** than
large reactors.]{.underline}

"[Without exception, **small reactors cost too much** for the **little
electricity they produce**]{.underline}"

Also in 2021, construction of the 300 MW demonstration lead-cooled BREST
fast neutron reactor began in Russia. The [cost estimate has more than
doubled]{.underline} to 100 billion rubles (US\$1.1 billion) and [no
doubt it will **continue to climb.**]{.underline}

[The rhetoric from small modular reactor (SMR) advocates is loud and

designs[. But **the few SMRs that have been built** (or have been
started) paint a different picture---one that looks startingly **similar
to the past**.]{.underline} [**Significant construction delays** are
still the norm and **costs have continued to climb.**]{.underline}

[IEEFA has taken a close look at the **data available from the four
SMRs** currently in operation]{.underline} or under construction, [as

SMR developers in the U.S. The results]{.underline} of the analysis
[show **little has changed** from our previous work. SMRs still are
**too expensive**, **too slow to build**, and **too risky** to play a
significant role in **transitioning from fossil fuels** in the coming 10
to 15 years.]{.underline}

But [despite the]{.underline} prodigious [chatter about a comeback of
nuclear, the endeavor to blanket the Earth with SMRs is a chimera that
**contradicts** the same established body of fact that the larger models
do]{.underline}, as reported in Undark, a media portal out of MIT. [That
this rollout won't happen]{.underline} -- [or if it eventually does,
will **unfold too late** to curb the climate crisis]{.underline} --
[might look like a **loss** to none other than the nuclear industry and
investors]{.underline} like Gates.

But its fallout is much broader: [nuclear's ostensible revival, whether
it pans out or not, **diverts critical resources** from the urgent task
at hand, namely the ever more important **buildout of clean
techn**ologies on hand and affordable]{.underline}.

"[Much of the battle to meet the **challenge of climate
change**]{.underline}," argued Mark Cooper of Vermont Law School in a
report subtitled, "Why Nuclear Subsidies are an Unnecessary Threat to
the Transformation," "[will **be over before** even **one of these
reactors is online**."]{.underline}

The most probable scenario is that these ideas never get off the ground.
Currently, there are just two facilities that roughly resemble the
envisioned SMR type, a pilot in China and Russia's diminutive Akademik
Lomonosov, also the world's first floating nuclear power plant (a dark
irony, its primary purpose is to power fossil fuel mining operations in
the Arctic.) Because the Akademik Lomonosov is Russian, it circumvented
design certification as required in North America and Europe, and is now
because of tension over the Ukraine war beyond the purview of Western
experts.

More small reactors are under construction in China and Russia, as well
as one in Argentina, but all of them are proving more expensive pro
kilowatt than traditional reactors. (There is a dedicated chapter on
SMRs in the most recent WNISR 2023.)

[In the U.S., the only developer with a design approved by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission is NuScale, which **hasn't yet laid a single
brick** in Idaho, where it plans to build. Its big win thus far is \$4
billion in federal tax subsidies that include a \$1.4 billion U.S.
Department of Energy contribution and the IRA's \$30/MWh
credit]{.underline}, according to the US-based Institute for Energy
Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

This year, [NuScale announced that a megawatt of electricity **will not
cost \$58/MWh**]{.underline}, as originally pledged, [but **rather
\$89/MWh**, because of construction costs now estimated at **\$9.3
billion rather than \$6.3 billion**]{.underline}. [BloombergNEF's
calculates that average global cost of **utility-scale solar** and
**onshore wind** at **\$45** and **\$46** per megawatt-hour,
respectively]{.underline}. Were the NuScale reactor to omit the
government subsidies, its price tag would be that much higher.

As expected, no NuScale SMR will be built in Idaho-- since it announced
that it will not begin construction until all of its expected generation
capacity is subscribed. Before the price hike, around 50 utilities and
other buyers have signed up for less than a quarter of capacity. In
November 2023, NuScale finally cancelled its contract with a US utility
for building its first SMR in Idaho.

Gates's TerraPower isn't even as far as NuScale, although it too is
cashing in on subsidies: the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced
Reactor Demonstration Program has pledged up to \$2 billion in matching
project costs for the construction of a Natrium-cooled demonstration
plant (modern nuclear power plants use water as a coolant) in Wyoming.
But the Gates project recently took a hit: it faces delays of at least
two years because its only source of fuel, namely uranium, was Russia.

[There's no reason that SMRs, like large reactors, will not be subject
to **egregious delays** and **cost overruns**, valid **safety concerns**
and the conundrum of **radioactive waste disposal**.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} planning-to-operation]{.underline} (PTO) [[times of **all
nuclear plants ever built** have been]{.underline} **[10-19 years or
more]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For example, [the Olkiluoto 3 reactor in
Finland was proposed to the Finnish cabinet in December 2000 to be added
to an existing nuclear power plant. Its latest estimated completion date
is 2020, giving it a PTO time of 20 years.]{.underline}

[SMRs so far? **Shut down**]{.underline}

[[The history of small reactors is a **history of
failure**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [Army
[built]{.mark} and operated [eight]{.mark} small reactors]{.underline}
beginning in the 1950s, **[but [they proved unreliable and
expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and the program was]{.underline}
**[shut down]{.underline}** in 1977. In addition, [[17]{.mark} small
civilian reactors [were built in the US]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
1950s and 1960s, but **[[all have]{.mark} since [shut
down.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Twenty-six small [Magnox reactors were built in the U.K.]{.mark} but
**[all]{.mark} have [shut down]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and **no more
will be built**]{.underline}. The only operating Magnox is a mini-Magnox
in North Korea: the design was made public at an Atoms for Peace
conference and North Korea uses its 5 MW Magnox to produce plutonium for
nuclear weapons.

[India operates 14 small pressurized heavy water reactors]{.underline},
each with a capacity of about 200 MW. Professor M.V. Ramana noted in his
2012 book, "The Power of Promise: Examining Nuclear Energy in India,"
that [despite a standardized approach to designing, constructing and
operating these reactors, many suffered cost overruns and lengthy
delays. There are no plans to build more]{.underline} of these small
reactors in India.

**[Elsewhere]{.underline}**, [the history of small reactors is just as
**underwhelming**]{.underline}. [This includes [three small reactors in
**Canada**]{.mark} (**all [shut down]{.mark}**), [six in
**France**]{.mark} (**all [shut down]{.mark}**) and [four in
**Japan**]{.mark} (**all [shut down]{.mark}**).]{.underline}

Ramana concludes his history of small reactors with this downbeat
assessment: "[**[Without exception]{.underline}**, [small reactors
**cost too much**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[for the little electricity
they produce]{.underline}**, [[the result of]{.mark} both their [**low
output** and]{.mark} their **[poor performance]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Just two SMR plants are said to be operating]{.underline} -- [neither
meeting the "modular" definition of serial factory production of reactor
components]{.underline}. [These so-called SMRs exhibit familiar problems
of **massive cost blowouts** and **multi-year delays.**]{.underline}

[The construction [cost of Russia's]{.mark} floating twin-reactor
[plant]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[increased
six-fold]{.underline}**]{.mark} and the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency
estimates that [the electricity it produces costs \$200 per
megawatt-hour (MWh).]{.underline} The reactor is used to power fossil
fuel mining operations in the Arctic.

[The other operating SMR]{.underline} -- loosely defined -- [is China's
demonstration]{.underline} twin-reactor high-temperature gas-cooled
[reactor]{.underline} (HTGR). The World Nuclear Association states that
the cost of the demonstration HTGR was \$6,000 per kilowatt, three times
higher than early cost estimates and two to three times higher than the
cost of China's larger Hualong reactors per kilowatt.

NucNet reported in 2020 that [[China]{.underline} **[dropped plans to
manufacture 20]{.underline}**]{.mark} HTGRs [[after]{.mark} levelised
[cost estimates rose to levels **higher than conventional**]{.mark}
**large [reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Likewise, [the World Nuclear
Association states that [plans for 18]{.mark}]{.underline} additional
HTGRs [at the same site as the demonstration]{.underline} HTGR **[[have
been "dropped".]{.underline}]{.mark}** China's demonstration HTGR
demonstrates yet again that [the]{.underline}
**[[economics]{.underline}]{.mark}** of small reactors **[[doesn't stack
up.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Three SMRs are under construction]{.underline} -- [again with the
qualification that there's nothing 'modular' about these
projects.]{.underline}

[**[Argentina's]{.mark}** CAREM [reactor has been a
**disaster**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Construction began in 2014 and the
National Atomic Energy Commission now hopes to complete the reactor in
2027 ‒ nearly 50 years after the project was conceived. The cost
estimate in 2021 was \$750 million for a reactor with a capacity of just
32 MW. That's a huge expense for a reactor with the capacity of a
handful of large wind turbines.

[[Even casual followers]{.mark} of energy]{.underline} and climate
issues [[have probably heard about]{.mark} the alleged [wonders
of]{.mark} small modular nuclear reactors]{.underline}
([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}). [[This is due]{.mark} in no small part
[to the **"nuclear bros":**]{.mark}]{.underline} [an]{.underline}
**[active]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} seemingly
**[tireless]{.underline}** [group of nuclear power [advocates who
**dominate social media**]{.mark} **discussions** on energy by
[promoting SMRs]{.mark} and other "advanced" nuclear technologies as the
only real solution for the climate crisis]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} as I showed in my 2013 and 2021 reports, **[the
[hype]{.mark} surrounding SMRs]{.underline}** [[is **way
overblown**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} my [conclusions
remain valid today.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [much of [this SMR happy talk is rooted in
**misinformation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} always
[brings me back to the same question:]{.underline} [[If the nuclear bros
have **such a great SMR story**]{.mark} to tell, [why]{.mark} do they
have to **[exaggerate]{.mark}** so much?]{.underline}

What are SMRs?

SMRs are nuclear reactors that are "small" (defined as 300 megawatts of
electrical power or less), can be largely assembled in a centralized
facility, and would be installed in a modular fashion at power
generation sites. Some proposed SMRs are so tiny (20 megawatts or less)
that they are called "micro" reactors. SMRs are distinct from today's
conventional nuclear plants, which are typically around 1,000 megawatts
and were largely custom-built. Some SMR designs, such as NuScale, are
modified versions of operating water-cooled reactors, while others are
radically different designs that use coolants other than water, such as
liquid sodium, helium gas, or even molten salts.

[To date]{.underline}, however, [[theoretical interest in SMRs **has not
translated** into]{.mark} many **[actual reactor
orders]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The only SMR currently under
construction is in China]{.underline}]{.mark}[. And in the United
States, only one company---TerraPower]{.underline}, founded by
Microsoft's Bill Gates---[has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a power reactor]{.underline}
([but]{.underline} at 345 megawatts, [it technically isn't even an
SMR]{.underline}).

### Solvency\-\--SMRs Fake\-\--2NC

#### The plan doesn't solve our costs arguments\-\--[even when]{.underline} the government [heavily subsidizes]{.underline} SMR projects, they still *[fail]{.underline}* and [bankrupt their parent companies]{.underline}\-\--there's [zero]{.underline} chance of successful large-scale SMR build\-\--NuScale and mPower prove!

**[NuScale Power]{.underline}**

In 2012, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[Department of
Energy]{.underline}]{.mark} (DOE) [[offered]{.mark} up to \$452 million
[to cover "the]{.mark} engineering, design, certification and licensing
[costs for up to two U.S. SMR designs]{.mark}]{.underline}."
[The]{.underline} two SMR [designs that were selected by the DOE for
funding were **[NuScale]{.mark}**]{.underline} Power
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Generation **[[mPower]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[NuScale]{.underline}]{.mark} **[recently [abandoned its flagship
project]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in Idaho. [The company secured
**subsidies** amounting]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} **around \$[4
billion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [from the U.S. government comprising a
\$1.4 billion subsidy from the DOE and an estimated \$30 per
megawatt-hour (MWh) subsidy in the Inflation Reduction Act. **[Despite
that]{.mark}**]{.underline} government largesse, [[NuScale **didn't come
close**]{.mark} to securing sufficient funding [to **get the project off
the ground.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NuScale's most recent cost estimates were **through the
roof**]{.underline}: \$9.3 billion for a 462 MW plant comprising six 77
MW reactors. That equates to \$20,100 per kilowatt and a levelised cost
of \$89 per MWh. Without the Inflation Reduction Act subsidy of
\$30/MWh, the figure would be \$129 per MWh.

Incredibly, NuScale still hopes to build SMRs but [[the company is
**burning cash** and **facing**]{.mark} **the real threat of
[bankruptcy]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[Generation **mPower**]{.underline}

Generation mPower ‒ a collaboration between Babcock & Wilcox and Bechtel
‒ [was the other SMR design prioritized by the U.S. DOE]{.underline}.
mPower was to be a 195 MW pressurized light water reactor.

In 2012, [[the]{.underline} **[DOE announced that it would subsidize
mPower]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in a]{.underline} five-year [cost-share
agreement]{.underline}. The DOE's contribution would be capped at \$226
million, of which \$111 million was subsequently paid. The following
year, Babcock & Wilcox said it intended to sell a majority stake in the
joint venture, but was unable to find a buyer.

In 2014, [Babcock & Wilcox announced it was sharply **reducing
investment**]{.underline} in mPower to \$15 million annually, [citing
the inability "to secure significant additional investors or customer
engineering, procurement and construction contracts to provide the
financial support necessary to develop and deploy mPower
reactors."]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} mPower **[[project was abandoned in
2017]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The joint venture companies spent more than
\$375 million on the project, in addition to the DOE's \$111 million
contribution.

[The fallout from the NuScale and mPower failures]{.underline}

[[NuScale and mPower had **everything going for them**]{.mark}**:**
large, experienced companies; conventional light-water reactor designs;
and **[generous government subsidies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But they
struggled to secure funding other than government subsidies.

Needless to say, [non-government funding is **even more
difficult**]{.underline} [to secure for projects without the involvement
of large companies; projects that envisage construction of
unconventional reactors such as **molten salt reactors**]{.underline},
**[fast neutron reactors]{.underline}**, etc.; [and projects that
haven't secured generous government subsidies]{.underline}.

[NuScale's failure is particularly striking given the **extent of the
government subsidies**]{.underline} [and that NuScale had **progressed
further through the licensing process**]{.underline} [than other SMR
designs -- which isn't saying much.]{.underline}

Not so "waste-annihilating" reactors go bust

**[[Many other plans]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to build small reactors
[have been **abandoned**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In 2013]{.underline},
American company [[Transatomic Power was promising]{.mark} that [its
"Waste-Annihilating Molten-Salt Reactor"]{.mark} [would deliver
safer]{.mark} nuclear [power]{.mark} at half the price of power from
conventional, large reactors]{.underline}. [**[By the end of
2018]{.underline}**, [the company had **given up**]{.underline}]{.mark}
on its "waste-annihilating" claims, **[run out of money [and gone
bust.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

MidAmerican Energy gave up on its plans for SMRs in Iowa in 2013 after
failing to secure legislation that would require ratepayers to partially
fund construction costs.

In 2018, TerraPower abandoned its plan for a prototype fast neutron
reactor in China due to restrictions placed on nuclear trade with China
by the Trump administration.

The French government abandoned the planned 100-200 MW ASTRID
demonstration fast reactor in 2019.

The U.S. government abandoned consideration of 'integral fast reactors'
for plutonium disposition in 2015 and the U.K. government did the same
in 2019. (Plutonium disposition means destroying weapons-usable
plutonium through irradiation, or treating plutonium in such a way as to
render it useless in nuclear weapons.)

**[["Advanced" nuclear power on the retreat]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**[Dozens]{.underline}** [of SMR designs are being
promoted]{.underline}]{.mark} **[worldwide]{.underline}** ‒ [[mostly by
**start-ups**]{.mark} [with **nothing more than a Powerpoint**]{.mark}
**presentation**. Precious few will reach the construction stage and
[the **likelihood** of SMRs being built]{.mark} in **large numbers** [is
**negligible**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Likewise [there are **dim prospects** for the broader 'advanced' or
"Generation IV" nuclear sector, those comprising reactor concepts with a
variety of different fuels, moderators or coolants.]{.underline}

[Stop]{.underline} **["whistling past this graveyard"]{.underline}**

#### There is [nothing fundamentally different]{.underline} about SMRs\-\--they'll run into the same [insurmountable barriers]{.underline} as conventional nuclear.

Some [[proponents]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear energy [[refuse to
give up]{.mark} on the technology. [They blame]{.mark} the decline in
nuclear energy and the high costs and long construction periods on the
characteristics of [**older** reactor designs]{.mark}]{.underline},
[arguing that alternative designs will rescue nuclear
energy]{.underline} from its woes. In recent years, [the alternatives
most often advertised are small modular (nuclear)
reactors---**[SMRs]{.mark}** for short]{.underline}. These are designed
to generate between 10 and 300 megawatts of power, much less than the
1,000--1,600 megawatts that reactors being built today are designed to
produce.

[For over a decade now]{.underline}, many of [my colleagues and I have
consistently explained why these reactors [would **not be commercially
viable**]{.mark} and why they [would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[never
resolve the undesirable consequences]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [building [nuclear]{.mark} power
plants]{.underline} (more on this topic in chapter 6). I first started
examining small modular reactors when I worked at Princeton University's
Program on Science and Global Security. [Our group largely comprised
**physicists**]{.underline}, [and we used a mixture of technical
assessments, mathematical techniques, and social-science-based methods
to study various problems associated with these
technologies]{.underline}. My colleague Alex Glaser, for example, used
neutronics models to calculate how much uranium would be required as
fuel for SMRs, which we then used to estimate the increased risk of
nuclear weapons proliferation from deploying such reactors.3 Zia Mian,
originally from Pakistan, and I showed why [the [**technical
characteristics** of SMRs would **not allow** for]{.mark} simultaneously
[solving]{.mark}]{.underline} the four [key problems identified with
nuclear]{.underline} [power]{.underline}: **[its [high
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[its [accident
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the difficulty of **dealing with
radioactive [waste]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and its linkage with the
capacity to make nuclear weapons.4 [[My colleagues and I also undertook
case studies]{.mark} on **Jordan**, **Ghana**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} **[Indonesia]{.underline}**, [three [countries
advertised]{.mark} by SMR vendors [as potential customers]{.mark}, and
showed that]{.underline} despite much talk, **[[none of them were
investing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in SMRs]{.underline}, because of
various country-specific reasons such as public opposition and
institutional interests.

We were not the only people coming up with reasons for not believing in
the claim that new reactor designs would solve all these problems. Other
scientists and analysts also highlighted the dangers and false promises
of SMRs.

[Nuclear advocates are not deterred]{.underline} by such arguments.
[[They insist that this time it will be different]{.mark}. Nuclear
plants would be cheap, would be quick to build, would be safe, would
never have to be shut down in unplanned ways, and would not be affected
by climate-related extreme weather events]{.underline}. **[[The evidence
from the real world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which I elaborate on later,
[[suggests]{.underline} **[otherwise]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Nuclear
reactors are unlikely to possess any of these
characteristics]{.underline}, let alone all of them. Thus, [what is
actually being advocated might be termed **faux nuclear plants**,
existing only in the **imagination** of some, **not in the real
world.**]{.underline}

This paper addresses the pressing need for rapid decarbonization of
energy systems by examining the role of nuclear power in future energy
scenarios collected in the IPCC database. Despite their explorative
character, energy scenarios can influence decision-makers or might be
used to promote certain technology developments. They are increasingly
subject to the integration into real-world settings and thus the need
for feasibility assessments has emerged in literature. [The case of
nuclear power is of particular interest, for which proponents project
steep capacity increases]{.underline}, [whereas]{.underline}
**[literature]{.underline}** [shows a **technology in
decline**]{.underline}. The paper investigates this discrepancy and
questions the nuclear scale-up in energy scenarios by investigating
proposed technology scale-up thresholds for low carbon scenarios. By
doing so, it moves beyond the often-applied aggregate view of nuclear
power and explores the techno-economic feasibility from a
reactor-technology-specific lens. [Three reactor technologies are
chosen]{.underline}: currently dominant [high-capacity light water
reactors]{.underline}, [small modular reactors]{.underline}, [and
non-light water-cooled reactors]{.underline} ([so-called **"new" or
"advanced"** reactor concepts]{.underline}). [Results indicate that
**[none of the]{.mark} currently [proposed reactor
technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[are]{.underline} **[fit
for]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[necessary rapid
[decarbonization]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[due to **availability
constraints and economic challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. We further
suggest the adaptation of proposed thresholds to absolute metrics based
on energy generation and towards the inclusion of a sub-technology
specific perspective. Overall, [the need for further
**[scrutiny]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of energy scenarios]{.underline},
particularly **[concerning nuclear power]{.underline}**, [[is
emphasized]{.mark} in order [to prevent
**instrumentalization**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[political]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[industry
actors.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The urgency of climate change requires a rapid decarbonization of energy
systems until 2050 \[1\]. In this context, energy scenarios are a useful
tool to explore variations of future energy systems and show possible
pathways towards the achievement thereof \[2\]. However, despite their
explorative character, energy scenarios can influence decision-makers or
might be used to promote certain technology developments \[3,4\].
Consequently, energy scenarios are increasingly subject to attempts to
be integrated into real-world settings. The assessment of the
feasibility of such implementations has thus emerged in literature
\[\[5\], \[6\], \[7\]\].

The role of nuclear power in future energy systems is especially
controversial. While some research suggests that future energy systems
can function with renewable energies only, such as wind and solar
\[\[8\], \[9\], \[10\]\], others include nuclear power as an option
\[\[11\], \[12\], \[13\]\] or even as a required complement to
renewables \[14,15\]. **[[Experience]{.underline}]{.mark}** however
[[shows nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} power [**[to be a technology in
decline]{.underline}**, [and a nuclear industry that will **likely not
be able to live up to expectations**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a **[rapid capacity
scale-up]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[16,17\].

Nonetheless, [proponents envision a substantial nuclear scale-up by
establishing **["novel" technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[including]{.mark} concepts for so-called ["small modular
reactors"]{.mark} (SMRs) or so-called "new" and "advanced" non-light
water reactors]{.underline} (SNRs), [and thus hope to reverse the
current trend of decline \[]{.underline}18,19\]. This is shown by a
recent declaration of 22 countries at COP28, that pledged a tripling of
today\'s installed nuclear capacity by 2050 \[20\]. Especially SMRs are
anticipated to accelerate the deployment and reduce costs compared to
high-capacity light water reactors (LWR) \[21,22\]. [Such plans and
underlying expectations [should be **treated with caution**]{.mark} as
[nuclear]{.mark} power [has **often** been]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[subject to overly **optimistic**]{.mark} scale-up
[expectations]{.mark} in the past, [which the **industry has failed to
deliver upon**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[23,24\].

#### This is [textbook industry messaging]{.underline}\-\--new technology will [magically]{.underline} solve all of nuclear energy's problems, but it's always years in the future. [Don't fall for it!]{.underline}

Unfortunately, [[innovation is **still far away**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[When [critics]{.mark} of nuclear energy [bring up problems like]{.mark}
radioactive]{.underline} [**[waste]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the non-renewability of
**[uranium]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [proponents]{.underline}]{.mark}
[frequently [counter with promises of **new technologies**]{.mark} on
the horizon, [like]{.mark} using]{.underline} the
three-times-more-abundant **[[thorium]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as a
replacement for uranium, improved efficiencies in recycling spent fuel,
and [deep salt storage]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[But, like
[fusion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[the **commercial viability** and
**practical scalability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of these technologies
**[loom ever just out of reach]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[with]{.mark}
projected [timelines]{.mark} stretching years or **[decades into the

radioactive waste]{.underline}, with an expected cost of \$3.4 billion

solution can only accommodate a small amount of waste
and]{.underline}---depending as it does on Finland's high investment
capacity, [high state involvement, and particular
geology]{.underline}---[does not appear to be a scalable solution around
the world.]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline} **[false promise of advanced
reactors]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[When]{.underline} such [problems are highlighted, nuclear [proponents
offer another argument. These problems belong to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[past]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and are
relevant **only to older reactor designs**]{.underline}. [[Newer reactor
designs, which go by names like "**advanced**"]{.underline}]{.mark}
[reactors, [or "**generation-IV**"]{.mark} reactors]{.underline}, or
some other such fancy name, [[will not be afflicte]{.mark}d by these
issues.]{.underline}

The term "advanced" is arguably the most sweeping of these. If one goes
to their historical origins, even the large reactor designs being
offered by US nuclear reactor companies can be termed advanced. That's
because these reactor designs all benefitted from the US Department of
Energy's Advanced Light Water Reactor Program initiated in the 1980s.
That program aimed to "restore nuclear power as a viable option" in the
1990s, by producing "improved and simplified" reactor designs that were
to be "economically attractive, and constructable on a predictable and
reasonable schedule," an official from the DOE told the 1990 American
Power Conference. This program underwrote the AP1000 reactors that
proved disastrous to the consumers of Georgia and South Carolina (see
chapter 3).

[These days nuclear advocates shift the definition and use terms like
"advanced" to refer to reactor designs not cooled by water. That cooling
role is played by gases like helium,]{.underline} [or molten metals like
sodium,]{.underline} [or by molten chemical compounds called
salts]{.underline} (of which common salt---sodium chloride---is an
example). [Many of these reactor designs also fit into the category of
small modular reactors]{.underline} because they would produce less than
300 megawatts of electricity.

[But]{.underline} [**[earlier generations]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear [designers have **explored**]{.mark}
**just about [all these types of
reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---[and]{.underline} **[abandoned
them]{.underline}** [because of **technical or operational
problems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is impossible to go through each
reactor design, but I will explain some of the problems that afflict
three generic categories of reactors.

### Solvency\-\--Epistemology

#### Treat evidence from [nuclear lobby groups]{.underline} with [extreme skepticism]{.underline}\-\--they are [crooks]{.underline} who have been [lying]{.underline} and [suppressing information]{.underline} for decades.

specialist at the NGO Beyond Nuclear, "They won't tell you these truths
about nuclear energy",
https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5118792-nuclear-power-industry-radiation-debunk/

Perhaps [the biggest lies about nuclear stem from
Eisenhower's]{.underline} 1953 ["Atoms for Peace" speech]{.underline},
[a carefully crafted bid to recast nuclear technology as peaceful
after]{.underline} the atrocious 1945 [Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline} bombings. [Atoms for Peace promised to make
electricity "too cheap to meter"]{.underline} and "make the deserts
bloom," [while deliberately concealing the truth that nuclear was
utterly uncompetitive and not remotely economically viable]{.underline}
as a power source. [Civilian nuclear power was
**misdirection**]{.underline} [away from the real agenda of building
nuclear power plants]{.underline}, which was [to help supply the
**nuclear weapons complex**]{.underline}, producing enriched plutonium
as feedstocks for nuclear bombs in the burgeoning arms race.

Today, [[nuclear weapons are]{.mark} **still** [the **hidden
agenda**]{.mark}]{.underline} and secret rationale [[behind the
otherwise **nonsensical** nuclear]{.mark} power
[industry]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The resurgent nuclear arms race is the
real reason why many **[tens of billions in federal
subsidies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (\$53.5 billion in the Inflation
Reduction Act alone, plus billions more in state subsidies) [[are
propping up]{.mark} the [utterly **uncompetitive**]{.mark} nuclear
[power]{.mark} industry, and why [many **billions more of taxpayers'
money**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} now [getting thrown at
corporations pushing]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[chimerical "advanced"
nuclear and]{.mark} uneconomical]{.underline}**,
**[dirty]{.underline}**, **[[failing]{.underline}]{.mark}** small
modular reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**).

But some are pushing back, like Indigenous nations and public interest
advocates in southwest Washington, where Amazon is pushing to build SMRs
to power its AI business, heedless of their negative impacts and
prohibitive costs.

[[Of all the dangers of **reckless**]{.mark} **nuclear
[boosterism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [the most insidious is
**disinformation** concealing]{.underline}]{.mark} [and denying
[nuclear's past]{.mark}, present and future harms [while **wildly
exaggerating**]{.mark} **its [benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These
are [the **perennial tactics of the**]{.mark} **nuclear
[industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They **litter its history**, and
[they're **again getting traction today.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[But they can be countered with sunshine]{.underline} --- both the kind
that powers real renewables with which nuclear can't compete, and the
kind [that exposes its prevarications and lies with scientific
**evidence** and **public scrutiny.**]{.underline}

#### Arctic SMRs [fail]{.underline}. Security constraints, waste disposal, and rogue weaponry.

Arctic: The potential of small modular reactors,"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/expanding-nuclear-energy-to-the-arctic-the-potential-of-small-modular-reactors/,
AA\]

Nuclear power as an energy source in the Arctic was one of the major
topics at the Arctic Circle Assembly conference in Reykjavik last week.
The big conversation was primarily about the [[placement of]{.mark}
small modular reactors (**[SMR]{.mark}** - reactors under 300 MW) and
microreactors (up to 10 MW), which can be placed in remote communities
and which almost operate themselves, should we believe the
researchers]{.underline}. Several US companies are now planning to
develop modular reactors to replace diesel-operated generators in the
rural Arctic. [But the road to nuclear power as an energy source
[in]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}** is [paved with unclear
**consequences**]{.mark} and costs, explains Professor August Valfells,
who works at Reykjavik Technical College]{.underline}. The use of
nuclear power in small modular must comply with the International Atomic
Energy Agency\'s (IAEA) security measures, which include [security
functions, management constraints, personnel security, and security for
physical structures, areas, and units. The disposal of **[radioactive
waste]{.mark}** is an obstacle, and as of today, only Finland is
building the world\'s first permanent repository for high-level nuclear
waste on the island of Olkiluoto. It takes around 10,000 before the
[uranium]{.mark} that is buried is [at]{.mark} the [same radiation level
as]{.mark} when it is [extracted]{.mark} from nature.]{.underline} [But
the radioactive [waste]{.mark} must be [buried for]{.mark} even
[longer]{.mark} - for [100,000 years]{.mark}. Today\'s [climate
measures]{.mark} may [become]{.mark} a **[headache for future
generations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"The only real option that exists
today is an intermediate solution, in which the radioactive fuel rods
are lowered into a pool to lock in the radiation for five to ten years.
This also cools down the radioactive substance,\" explains Valfells. The
fuel rods then have to be stored over a longer period of time, and that
is a solution that does not exist yet. Dry cask storage is therefore
being used indefinitely. [Another problem with commercializing nuclear
reactors is, of course, that [uranium could]{.mark} [fall into]{.mark}
the [wrong hands]{.mark} and [be used for **weapons**]{.mark}. The
[transport of]{.mark} nuclear [fuel]{.mark} to remote areas is also
[unclear]{.mark}, and possible [long-term **damage**]{.mark} to the
[surrounding environment]{.mark} has not yet been mapped]{.underline}.
In Alaska, extra attention ought to be given to the [\"Chariot\"
experiment, the state\'s past [trampling]{.mark} of the [**indigenous**
population]{.mark}. \"The indigenous communities must be part of the
process and the decisions that are made,\"]{.underline} says Diane
Hirshberg, Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research and
Professor of Education Policy at the University of Alaska Anchorage. [In
light of the state coming close to testing nuclear explosives near
Alaska and using the indigenous people as guinea pigs for medical
projects, it is not difficult to imagine that the [population]{.mark} is
[skeptical of having nuclear reactors]{.mark} placed in their
neighborhoods. \"They [sprinkled **radioactive waste** on the
tundra]{.mark},\" says Diane Hirshberg during an Arctic Circle panel
discussion.]{.underline} Now she wants to make sure that history does
not repeat itself. \"The US has a long history of targeting vulnerable
people who do not speak English. The legacy of America is mistrust. The
state did not clean up the waste until the 1990s, and even then, they
did not take it all and had to come back.\"

### Solvency\-\--Epistemology

#### Be [inherently skeptical]{.underline} of AFF solvency\-\--the nuclear industry always [over-promises]{.underline} then [fails]{.underline}\-\--new reactors will be [no different]{.underline}.

Kevin **Kamps 24**, radioactive waste specialist at Beyond Nuclear,
former Radioactive Waste Specialist at Nuclear Information and Resource
Service, has also met with and testified before officials at the highest
levels of the U.S. federal agencies charged with radioactive waste
management, including the Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, and Environmental Protection Agency, "Nuclear 'Renaissance'
Recalls Past Boondoggles, Legacy of Failures",
https://www.powermag.com/blog/nuclear-renaissance-recalls-past-boondoggles-legacy-of-failures/

[[Yet another nuclear]{.mark} power
["**renaissance**"?]{.mark}]{.underline} Again? [The **industry** and
its **friends in high places** would like us all to believe
so]{.underline}. But, besides the fact that "relapse" would be a better
word choice, [we've also seen this bad horror flick before]{.underline}.

[Anyone [recall the]{.mark}]{.underline} George W. [[Bush
administration's attempt]{.mark}ed nuclear power relapse?]{.underline}
[[Of some **three-dozen**]{.mark} **gigantic new [reactors]{.mark}
proposed**]{.underline}, [[only]{.underline}
**[two]{.underline}**]{.mark}---Vogtle 3 & 4---[[ever made it]{.mark}
into operation]{.underline}. [Albeit **[seven years behind
schedule]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and [more than **double the price
tag**]{.mark}]{.underline} Southern and Georgia Power
[predicted]{.underline} in 2012, more than \$35 billion instead of
"just" \$15 billion. Of course, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) had
predicted, as cited in Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force Report of May
2001, that such new reactors would "only" cost \$2.5 billion each, not
more than \$17.5 billion each! [Hence, \$12 billion in federal loan
guarantees, and "nuclear tax" surcharges on ratepayers' bills, were
required---[private capital **wouldn't touch it.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The rest]{.mark} of those proposed reactors [have simply been
**canceled**]{.mark} at **various stages of development**]{.underline}.
[[Many]{.underline} **[never broke ground]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[including Fermi 3 in Michigan, despite license approval from the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to construct and
operate]{.underline}. [Others **ended half-built**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[less]{.underline}**, as at Summer 2 and 3,
[contributing to the bankruptcy of century-old
**Westinghouse**]{.underline}, [and near-bankruptcy of century-old
**Toshiba**]{.underline}. [Summer 2 and 3's cancellation represented a
\$9 billion]{.underline} or more [loss to the ratepayers of South
Carolina]{.underline}, many of whom are low income and/or African
American. [They]{.underline} [will be paying for this fiasco on their
electric bills for decades]{.underline}---long after a small handful of
corporate execs finish their short time behind bars for fraud---with no
electricity in return.

Of course, [[that]{.mark} nuclear ["renaissance" going **belly
up**]{.mark}]{.underline} [just [echoed **earlier booms gone
bust**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Recall the Forbes editorial of February
11, 1985, entitled "Nuclear Follies," which stated: "[The failure of the
U.S. nuclear power program ranks as the **largest managerial
disaster**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[business
history]{.underline}**, a disaster [on a **monumental
scale**]{.underline}. The utility industry has already invested \$125
billion in nuclear power ... only the blind, or the biased, can now
think that most of the money has been well spent."

Scores, even [**[hundreds]{.underline}**, [of
reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} [were [**abandoned** at **various
stages**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of development [in the past 50]{.mark}+
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}. This included Midland Units 1 and 2,
abandoned after being 85% and 50% built, due to safety-significant
buildings sinking into the ground, a nuclear Leaning Tower of Pisa. By
1983, Consumers Energy had spent nearly \$4.5 billion---\$13.75 billion
adjusted for inflation, expressed in 2023 dollar figures. It is the
largest infrastructure fiasco in Michigan history. Whereas Richard
[Nixon had touted "Project Energy Independence," envisioning a thousand
reactors across the U.S. by]{.underline} the year [2000]{.underline},
"[only]{.underline}" [135 were built]{.underline}. [Of these, some
**never made it to full power**]{.underline} operations, such as
Shoreham. [Most of the burden of the \$6 billion **wasted**]{.underline}
(in 1989 dollars, which would be \$15 billion in 2023)---[fell
on]{.underline} Long Island **[ratepayers]{.underline}**: a 3% surcharge
was added onto electric bills for 30 years, to pay off the monumental
price tag.

Along the same lines, [the five-reactor Washington Public Power Supply
System]{.underline} (WPPSS) [defaulted on \$2.25 billion in municipal
bonds]{.underline} in 1983 (\$7 billion in 2023 dollars), one of the
largest such defaults in American history. [Hence, WPPSS became known as
"Whoops"!]{.underline}

But, **[[despite]{.mark} the [lessons that should have been
learned]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[here we go again]{.underline}**,
[with a **propaganda**]{.underline}]{.mark}-,
**[lobbying]{.underline}**-, [and]{.underline} **[campaign

before.]{.underline} [So-called **["Small Modular

"UAMPS" project, [NuScale]{.mark}'s in Idaho, with the [**cancellation**
of eight SMRs]{.mark}, the first certified design. [This happened
**despite massive subsidization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most recently,
**[NextEra]{.underline}** [has wisely dismissed SMRs as not "too cheap
to meter," but rather **too expensive to matter.**]{.underline}

[At stake are]{.underline} thousands of [well-paid power station

funds are diverted away from cheaper options for generating power.
Central to the debate is how governments can best cut fossil fuel use in
time to save the world from catastrophic climate change.

[There is not much middle ground]{.underline}. [On one side are **trade
unions** with many members in the nuclear industry]{.underline},
**[large companies]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[political
clout]{.underline}** [and a **vested interest** in building the

see wind, solar and tidal power, batteries and other emerging
technologies as the path to far more jobs, a cleaner future, and a
possible route out of potential disaster]{.underline}. There are also
those who fear the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

Lack of balance

**[Very little]{.underline}** [of this debate takes place where it
should]{.underline}, in national parliaments. In some countries, like
the UK and the US, nearly all politicians support the nuclear industry,
so there is little discussion of its merits.

[[Many of the **"news" clips** and **pro-nuclear

**[This [lack of balance is not surprising]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[Journalists find it difficult to penetrate an

bodies have warned that to stop irreversible damage from climate change,
we need to **reduce emissions drastically** within the **next
decade**]{.underline}. [The SMR contribution]{.underline} in the next
decade [will be essentially **zero**]{.underline}. [The prospects for
SMRs]{.underline} beyond that [are]{.underline} also
**[bleak]{.underline}**, [given that entire **supply chains would need
to be established** after the first ones have been built, tested and
proven in the field]{.underline}.

[The D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [E]{.underline}nergy [has
been pursuing SMRs since the **last century**. In 2001, the DOE's Office
of Nuclear Energy projected that there were nearly 10 SMR designs that
"have the potential to be economical]{.underline} and could be made
available for deployment before the end of the decade, provided that
certain technical and licensing issues are addressed."

[Nearly **two decades after**]{.underline} that rosy notion, [the
earliest official projected deployment date is only **2029** to
**2030**]{.underline} for the leading design, NuScale. [Even that date
is **highly uncertain**, because the **N**uclear **R**egulatory
**C**ommission's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards has identified
**serious safety concerns** that will have to be addressed before any
utility applies for permission to construct an SMR]{.underline}.
Significantly, [a central concern involves the **steam generator**,
which]{.underline}, as noted above, [is inside the reactor vessel and a
potential source of **reliability** and **economic
problems.**]{.underline}

[SMRs]{.underline} also [divert **valuable public money**]{.underline}.
For example, [the federal government has contributed]{.underline} at
least [**\$314 million** to the development of the NuScale SMR design
and has reportedly agreed to spend up to **\$350 million**]{.underline}
in new matching funds. [Babcock & Wilcox received over **\$100 million**
from the DOE for its mPower design but **abandoned the project** in 2017
because there were **no customers.**]{.underline}

### Warming\-\--No Solvency\-\--2NC

#### Nuclear power doesn't make a [dent]{.underline} in warming\-\--[best-case scenario]{.underline} is 4% emissions reduction and that's [physically impossible]{.underline}.

green and peaceful world",
https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/52758/reasons-why-nuclear-energy-not-way-green-and-peaceful-world/

1\. [[Nuclear]{.mark} energy [delivers **too little to
matter**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In order to tackle climate change, we need to reduce fossil
fuels]{.underline} in the total energy mix **[well before
2050]{.underline}** to 0%.

[[According to]{.mark} scenarios from the [World Nuclear Association and
the OECD Nuclear]{.mark} Energy [Agency]{.mark}]{.underline}
([both]{.underline} nuclear **[lobby organisations]{.underline}**),
[[doubling the capacity of nuclear]{.mark} power **[worldwide]{.mark}**
in 2050 [would **only decrease**]{.mark} **greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline} **[around
4%.]{.underline}**]{.mark} But [[in order to do that, the world would
need to bring **37**]{.mark} **new large nuclear
[reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to the grid **every year**]{.mark}
**from now**, year on year, **[until 2050.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The last decade only showed a few to **10** new grid connections per
year]{.underline}. **[[Ramping]{.mark} that up [to 37 is physically
impossible]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [there is not sufficient capacity
to make large forgings like reactor vessels. There are currently only 57
new reactors under construction or planned for the coming one-and-a-half
decade]{.underline}. **[[Doubling]{.mark} nuclear
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [different from the explosive growth
of clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind]{.underline} --
[[is therefore **unrealistic**]{.underline}. **[And that for only
4%]{.underline}**]{.mark} when we already need to reduce 100%.

#### Even the [best-case projections]{.underline} for global nuclear growth *[barely make a dent]{.underline}* in warming\-\--but there's [too many barriers]{.underline} regardless.

change?", Energy Policy, Volume 155, August 2021, 112363

**[Conclusions]{.underline}** [and **policy implications**]{.underline}

Anthropogenic [climate change requires a **rapid shift** towards a CO2
neutral economy, if the global average temperature increase is to be
kept below 2C]{.underline}, or, preferably, below 1.5C compared to
pre-industrial levels. By 2050 the economy should be CO2 neutral,
[therefore climate change mitigation measures are needed in the near
term to medium term]{.underline} future. Such a shift would strongly
influence the energy (and electricity) supply system, which is currently
based to a larger part on fossil fuels.

[The]{.underline} **[most important result]{.underline}** [of the
present work is that [the **contribution of nuclear**]{.mark} **power
[to mitigate climate change is]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline} **[will be, very
limite]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[d]{.underline}**. [According to current
planning [nuclear]{.mark} power [would avoid **at
most**]{.mark}]{.underline} [annually **[2--3% of total global GHG
emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the years 2020--2040]{.underline}.
[Moreover, [nuclear]{.mark} power **[cannot be
expanded]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to be the main source of future
electricity generation]{.underline}. [[Expansion]{.mark} scenarios
[require an increase in **uranium mining**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which
is met by two limitations: uranium [production could **hardly keep up**
during]{.mark} the [expansion]{.mark} phase, [and the overall amount of
available uranium is **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such
[scenarios]{.mark} would [leave new]{.mark} nuclear power [plants
**without fuel**]{.mark}]{.underline} [during their planned life
time.]{.underline} Fast [breeder reactors promise a
solution]{.underline} to the problem of limited uranium-235 resources,
[but will not be available for commercial deployment before
**2040--2050**]{.underline}. And [given the considerable **research
effort and research times**]{.underline} [up to now, it is even
**doubtful** if a commercially deployable fast breeder reactor will be
available **then**]{.underline}. [But even assuming such a scenario were
feasile, **[even substituting all fossil fired power plants by
nuclear]{.mark} power plants [would still leave 70% of projected global
GHG emissions from other sectors in 2040]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} would still [require **drastic actions**]{.mark} to reduce
all emissions to zero.]{.underline}

#### AND\-\--nuclear doesn't reduce emissions\-\--[longitudinal studies]{.underline}.

Dr. Benjamin K. **Sovacool et al. 20**, PhD in Science and Technology

renewable electricity versus nuclear power", Nat Energy 5, 928--935,
https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-00696-3

Accordingly, [[this]{.mark} paper [uses regression analyses to
interrogate]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant and consistent [global
[datasets extending **over 25 years and 123
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and to test]{.underline}]{.mark}
[interconnected [hypotheses related to **carbon emissions**]{.mark}
**reduction** [with **nuclear power**]{.mark} and renewable
energy]{.underline}, as well as one about crowding out and technological
lock-in. [One core finding is that [countries with nuclear power]{.mark}
attachments]{.underline} **[[do not]{.mark} tend to [have significantly
lower levels of]{.mark} national carbon
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A second core finding is that lower
levels of carbon emissions do associate more strongly with the relative
scales of national attachments to renewable energy than with nuclear
attachments. In other words, it is renewable (more than nuclear)
attachments that tend to be associated in practice with significantly
lower levels of carbon emissions. This is in line with recent work such
as that of [Jin and Kim]{.underline}, who [find]{.underline}, [using
data from a sample of 30 countries]{.underline}, [that]{.underline}
"**[[nuclear]{.mark} energy [does not contribute to carbon
reduction]{.mark}]{.underline}** unlike renewable energy"6 . A third
core finding is that the scales of nuclear and renewable attachments
tend to vary negatively with each other. This is broadly consistent with
a finding that nuclear and renewables commitments crowd each other out.
[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} then [rigorously test and seek to [validate
these findings]{.mark} through further **[multiple regression
analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as well as an investigation of possible
moderating effects.]{.underline} Note that the carbon-emission trends
observed may not occur because of the choice between renewable or
nuclear energy; the choice might be one result of a broader policy
programme that leads to less carbon emissions (or does not).

### Warming\-\--SMRs Bad\-\--1NC

Other concerns

[**Water use** is another concern that is expected to **intensify** in
the future]{.underline}. [Nuclear plants have **very high water
withdrawal requirements**. A single 300 MW reactor operating at 90
percent capacity factor would withdraw]{.underline} 160 million to
[**390 million gallons of water** every day, heating it up before
discharge]{.underline}. [Reducing the demand for water]{.underline} by
using air cooling will [require the addition of a **tower** and **large
electric fans**]{.underline} ­-- further [**raising the construction
cost** and **reducing output of electricity** by **up to 7 percent** of
the capacity of the reactor.]{.underline}

Finally, [SMRs will]{.underline} also [produce many kinds of
**radioactive nuclear waste**, because the reactors are **smaller in
physical size** and because of **refueling practices** adopted for
economic reasons]{.underline}. [SMRs based on light water
designs]{.underline}, such as NuScale, [will]{.underline} also [produce
a **larger mass of nuclear waste per MWh** of electricity generated. The
federal government is already **paying billions of dollars** in fines
for not fulfilling its contractual obligations to take possession of
spent fuel from existing reactors]{.underline}. [The legislative plan in
the **1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act**]{.underline} was for a deep
geologic disposal repository to open in 1998. After nearly four decades,
that plan [has **come to naught.**]{.underline}

Conclusion

[There **is no realistic prospect** that SMRs can make a **significant
dent** in the need to **transition rapidly** to a **carbon-free
electricity system**. The prospects of timely contributions by even the
light water designs,]{.underline} with NuScale being the most advanced
in schedule, [are **dismal**. The prospects for reactors of other
designs, like those with graphite fuels or sodium cooling, are even more
so.]{.underline}

It will be a [tough]{.underline} road [for SMRs to achieve **cost
parity** with large reactors]{.underline}. And that [cost
will]{.underline} still [be **far too high**. Two things are in
critically short supply on the road to a climate-friendly energy system:
**time** and **money**. An **objective evaluation** indicates that
**SMRs are poor on both counts**]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline}
simply [no realistic prospect for SMRs to play materially significant
role in **climate change mitigation.**]{.underline}

[Even]{.underline} **[existing plants emit]{.underline}** [due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the continuous **[mining and refining of

new nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[78 to
[178 g]{.mark}-CO2/kWh]{.underline}**, **[[not close to
0]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Of this, 64 to 102 g-CO2/kWh over 100 years
are emissions from the background grid]{.underline} **[while consumers
wait]{.underline}** 10 to **[19 years for nuclear to come
online]{.underline}** [or be refurbished, relative to 2 to 5 years for
wind or solar]{.underline}. In addition, **[all nuclear
plants]{.underline}** [emit 4.4 g]{.underline}-CO2e/kWh [from the water
vapor and heat they release]{.underline}. This contrasts with solar
panels and wind turbines, which reduce heat or water vapor fluxes to the
air by about 2.2 g-CO2e/kWh for a net difference from this factor alone
of 6.6 g-CO2e/kWh.

[In fact, [**China's** investment in nuclear]{.mark} plants that [**take

rather than declining by an estimated average of 3 percent. [The

deaths in years prior and since.]{.underline}

Hypothesized damaging consequences of global warming include (i) loss of
life from greater intensity and frequency of heat waves, hurricanes,
floods, droughts, and wildfires and (ii) economic losses from such
extreme-weather events and from sea-level rise due to melting polar ice
caps. [**Assessments** of the impact from **human**-caused warming are
**complicated** by]{.underline} the [**[difficulty]{.mark}** of
[determining]{.mark}]{.underline} the [extent to which **observed
[temp]{.mark}**erature [increases]{.mark} are [caused by
**natural**]{.mark} **climate [variability]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [a
**difficulty** [that **adds**]{.mark} to the **[uncertainty]{.mark}** in
**estimates** of how much human-caused warming to
**expect**]{.underline} over the 21st century.

Warming over the past 120 years

The question of whether global warming is dangerous (whatever its cause)
can be addressed by examining the behavior of the climate since before
the time human activity generated large amounts of greenhousegas
emissions. Human-caused global warming is typically measured with
reference to pre-industrial times; for practical reasons in terms of the
availability of data, the usual approach employs a baseline period in
the late 19th century. Since the late 19th century, Earth's average
temperature has increased by about 1.3o C (2.3o F). During the same
period, average global sea level has risen 8-9 inches, and [there has
been]{.underline} little or [[**no detectable** change
in]{.underline}]{.mark} most types of [**extreme [weather]{.mark}**
events]{.underline} when measured against the background of natural
weather and climate variability.

Since the late 19th century, with 1.3o C of global warming,
[[humanity]{.mark} has [seen **unprecedented increases** in
**prosperity**]{.mark} and **well-being**]{.underline}. Global
population has increased from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to 8.2 billion
people in 2024. In 1900, the global average lifespan was 34 years; [in
2024 the **global average [lifespan]{.mark}** more than
**[doubled]{.mark}**]{.underline} to 73 years. From 1961 to 2020,
[**global [ag]{.mark}**ricultural output **nearly
[quadrupled]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with a 53% increase in per capita
output despite a 2.6-fold increase in global population.

Since the early 1900s, per capita [[**mortality** from]{.mark}
hurricanes, **floods**, **droughts**, and **wildfires** has
[decreased]{.mark} by almost **[98%]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Koonin
(2021, page 170)). These favorable trends in weather- and
climate-related [**[mortality]{.mark} rates**
[reveal]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [world]{.mark} is now **much
better** at [**preventing** deaths from]{.mark} extreme weather and
**[climate]{.mark} events**]{.underline} than it was a century ago. The
sharp reduction in death rates has been [accomplished [through]{.mark}
**greater [wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([[driven by]{.mark} **energy
derived** from **fossil [fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}), which provides
[**better [infra]{.mark}**structure, **superior
[a]{.mark}**dvance-**[w]{.mark}**arning technologies, and **greater
[capacity]{.mark}** [to **recover**]{.mark} from weather-related
**disasters**]{.underline}.

Although the role of higher temperatures and atmospheric CO2
concentrations in these favorable changes in mortality rates is open to
debate, two aspects of the increases are unambiguously beneficial.
[First, **[sat]{.mark}**ellite observation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
since the 1980s [[indicate]{.mark} **widespread [greening]{.mark}** of
the [planet]{.mark}. The satellite **data show** that, over the **last
two** decades]{.underline}, Earth has increased its green leaf area by
approximately 5%. This greening reflects increased CO2 fertilization,
warmer temperatures, and more rainfall (Chen et al. (2024)).

The second aspect relates to heat and cold extremes. An unambiguous
consequence of global warming is more frequent heat extremes, coupled
with less frequent cold extremes. It is well known that mortality is
substantially greater (almost a factor of 10) for extreme cold than for
extreme heat (Zhao et al. (2021). Consequently, [**[rising
temp]{.mark}**eratures are [**associated** with]{.mark} a **[net
saving]{.mark}** of [lives]{.mark}]{.underline} owing to the reduction
of mortality from extreme cold events. Heat-related mortality is also
declining over time (O'Neill et al. (2021)), owing to general
improvements in health care systems, increasing prevalence of
residential air conditioning, and behavioral changes -- factors that
have dominated any impact of a warmer planet on the risk of heat-related
death.

Although the dollar value of damages from extreme weather events is now
greater than it was many decades ago, this increase is the result of
increasing vulnerability and exposure associated with greater population
and concentration of wealth in coastal and other disaster-prone regions.
A recent analysis summarizing many studies finds no evidence to support
claims that any part of the overall increase in global economic losses
from weather and climate disasters can be attributed to global warming
(Pielke (2020, 2023)).

Prospective warming over the 21st century

What about warming over the rest of the 21st century? Is there reason to
expect dire consequences for humanity going forward in time?

The Apocalyptic climate narrative and the most extreme impacts are
driven by extreme emissions scenarios, with 4-5o C of warming by 2100
(above a baseline in the late 19th century). However, since 2021, [the
**UN**]{.underline}'s climate negotiators [have **[abandoned
extreme]{.mark}** emissions [scenarios as
**unrealistic**]{.mark}]{.underline} for two reasons. First, [they
[make]{.mark} **unrealistic [assumptions]{.mark}**, especially [about
**coal**]{.mark} **use**]{.underline}. Second, [[**actual**
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [[tracking]{.mark} **well
[below]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [**most [extreme]{.mark}** emission
[scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}, and indeed slightly below their medium
emissions scenario. The [**[UN]{.mark}** is **now [working]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} an [estimated **year [2100]{.mark}** warming
[of **2.5°C**]{.mark}]{.underline} (UNFCCC (2022)), while the IEA
Roadmap to NetZero projects 2.4°C of warming by 2100 (IEA (2023)). [When
**[plausible]{.mark} scenarios** [of **natural**]{.mark} **climate
[variability]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} values of **climate
[sensitivity]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the lower end of the UN's IPCC
likely range are considered, the [[**expected** warming]{.mark} could be
**significantly [lower]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Lee et al. (2021)).

If we work with 2.5°C projected warming by 2100, more than half (1.3°C)
of the predicted increase in temperature has already occurred. [There
are **good reasons** to **expect continued** advances in
**prosperity**]{.underline} and well-being over the remainder of the
21st century -- [and **[ample]{.mark} reasons** such as [**AI** to
expect]{.mark} such [advances to **accelerate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the **so-called [threshold]{.mark}** [of
danger]{.mark}]{.underline} of 2°C warming since pre-industrial times
[[is **not**]{.mark} an **[objective]{.mark} threshold** of
danger]{.underline}. Rather, 2°C is a politically negotiated target
designed to motivate broad-based actions to reduce emissions (Curry
(2023, page 9)).

Importantly, [there is [**no credible** case]{.mark} that
[missing]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[2°C]{.mark}** target would
[pose]{.mark} an [**existential** risk]{.mark} to **humanity**.
[Humans]{.mark} have **[adapted]{.mark}** to]{.underline} ([[and
**thrived**]{.mark} in]{.underline}) [climates **[extremes]{.mark} far
[worse]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} in the **[pessimistic]{.mark}** extreme
[scenario]{.mark}]{.underline}, as summertime residents of Phoenix and
wintertime residents of Minneapolis demonstrate every year.

Two other risk-related points are relevant here. First, a basic
assumption in the socioeconomic scenarios used in formulating the UN
climate-assessment reports is that vulnerability to weather and climate
extremes decreases with greater wealth and economic development, as
adaptive capacity increases. All of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs) scenarios constructed for the most recent UN climate assessment
entail dramatic growth, with global GDP in 2100 between four and ten
times larger than in 2010 (Dellink et al. (2017)). These scenarios do
not imply any futures for humanity that are worse than today.

Second, risks from human-caused global warming are difficult to separate
credibly from natural weather and climate variability and the risks are
dominated by the vulnerabilities of less-developed countries and poorer
populations generally. Increasing wealth and productivity will continue
to reduce humanity's vulnerability to weather- and climate-related
risks.

Tipping points and surprises

Uncertainty about the impact on humans of continued use of fossil fuels
is dominated by the difficulties of estimating the likelihood of
catastrophic outcomes from climate tipping points that could cause
severe and possibly irreversible damage.

Climate tipping points are defined as abrupt or nonlinear transitions to
a different climate state, which are hypothesized to occur once some
threshold has been crossed, with regional or global consequences that
are largely uncontrollable and beyond our management. In other words,
tipping points are points of no return, at least on the century
timescale. In recent geologic history, abrupt climate change has been
caused by changes in ocean circulation patterns and ice-sheet dynamics,
including (i) the Younger Dryas (12,900- 11,700 years ago) when global
temperatures dropped by up to 15o C in some regions, (ii) an unnamed
sudden cooling event that occurred around 8,200 years ago and that
lasted about 150 years, and (iii) the Dansgaard-Oeschger Events
(115,000-11,500 years ago) with a series of abrupt warmings and cooling
during the last Ice Age with temperature shifts of 5-10o C occurring
within decades.

The [**[IPCC]{.mark}** Assessment Reports]{.underline} have
[**[considered]{.mark}** a number of **potential [tipping
points]{.mark}** [associated with]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark},
including **ice-sheet** collapse, collapse of the
**A**]{.underline}tlantic **[O]{.underline}**verturning
**[C]{.underline}**irculation, [carbon release from **permafrost**
thawing]{.underline}, and [destruction of the **Amazon rainforest** and
**coral reefs**]{.underline}. There are some preliminary [climate
**model** simulation**s** for]{.underline} some of these conjectured
tipping points. However, climate models [do **not** include the
**appropriate** physical, chemical, and biological **processes** to
**adequately simulate** such events]{.underline}. Hence, [these
**hypothesized** climate tipping points have been based largely upon the
consideration of **imperfect analogues**]{.underline} from the geologic
past, process models, and physically based storylines.

[The **likelihood** of any of the above types of **hypothesized**
tipping points]{.underline} occurring in the 21st century under the
medium emissions scenario [is]{.underline} generally [regarded as
**low**]{.underline}, although there is also low confidence in any
conclusions surrounding possible tipping points owing to deep
(Knightian) uncertainties in our understanding of the complex climate
system.

Could something genuinely catastrophic happen to the climate on the
timescale of the 21st century? Yes, although continued use of
[**[f]{.mark}**ossil **[f]{.mark}**uels is **[not]{.mark}** the
**[only]{.mark} possible** [cause]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [a
**[climate]{.mark} catastrophe** could]{.underline} also [be [**caused**
by **nuc**]{.mark}lear **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a series of
explosive volcanic eruptions, natural shifts in ocean circulation
patterns, and/or shifts in ice-sheet dynamics driven by geologic
processes.

It is impossible to remove all sources of climate-related risk, and it
would be unwise to attempt to try to avert low probability climate
catastrophes with policy actions that would themselves surely impose
massive near-term costs on humanity. There is no doubt that aggressive
near-term suppression of fossil-fuel use would impose significant costs
on humans until such time as viable replacements for fossil fuels were
found for the roles they play in the production of food, steel, cement,
and plastics.

The critical implication: In terms of rational risk management, there is
no case for policies that would suppress fossil-fuel use aggressively
simply because something bad might happen. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark}
such [[**suppression** to be **rational**]{.mark}, we should have good
reason to think]{.underline} that the [**[low probability]{.mark}**
climate [catastrophe we]{.mark} would **[avoid]{.mark}** would [be **far
worse** than]{.mark} the [**catastrophe** we]{.mark}]{.underline} would
surely [[induce by]{.mark} **moving [aggressive]{.mark}**ly to **[net
zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We have yet to see anyone provide credible
support for the latter argument.

### Warming\-\--No Impact\-\--2NC

#### Warming is [survivable]{.underline} AND [net-beneficial]{.underline}. 

**Cloete '23** \[Schalk; January 21; Research Scientist at SINTEF, PhD,

[**[Dangerous]{.mark}** Levels of [Warming]{.mark} are **[Highly
Unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[**Lynas** presents **compelling** evidence that life above **four
degrees** can get rather **uncomfortable**]{.underline}. Although
[**[four degrees]{.mark}** of warming does [not]{.mark} pose an
[**existential**]{.mark} threat]{.underline}, we can expect some serious
problems:

Sea levels could rise as much as 1 m by the end of the century,
potentially displacing a billion people if no coastal protection is
built.

Millions of climate refugees will migrate from regions plagued by more
frequent droughts and floods.

We can expect the occasional category 6 hurricane, and warmer waters
will allow major storms to develop further from the equator.

30x more people will be exposed to "dangerous heat" worldwide, and some
of the hottest places will occasionally reach potentially lethal
conditions where humans can no longer lose heat by sweating.

Without adaptation, the likelihood of food exporters experiencing a
disruptive 10% loss in output increases from virtually nothing to 86%.

Without human intervention, one-sixth of all species may go extinct.

A shifting Gulf Stream and more frequent El Niños and La Niñas could
create large climactic changes around the world.

Permafrost melt could drive an additional 0.2--1 °C of warming, pushing
us toward a five-degrees world where things could start getting out of
control.

As scary as these threats are, [the fact is that [we'll have to **try
very hard** to achieve **four**]{.mark} **degrees** of anthropogenic
global **warming** this century, e.g., the almost
**unthinkable**]{.underline} SSP3--7.0 emissions trajectory shown below.

CO2 emission trajectories in the five scenarios covered by the IPCC

[More **[likely]{.mark}** scenarios]{.underline} like SSP2--4.5,
although a far cry from "net zero by 2050," [will see a
**[peak]{.mark}** temperature rise of about **[3 °C]{.mark}** with
[**very little** chance of]{.mark} touching **[4
°C]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the error bars below show 90% confidence
bounds).

The change in global temperatures in the five IPCC scenarios

[After **fourteen** years of work in **clean energy R&D**]{.underline}
and thousands of free-time hours spent studying other sustainable
development solutions, [I'd be **[quite surprised]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(and disappointed) [if we **[don't]{.mark}** manage to [stay
**below**]{.mark}]{.underline} SSP2--4.5, [with **[2.5 °C]{.mark}** of
peak **warming** appearing **most likely**]{.underline}. Other factors
such as the [**finite supply** of cheap oil and gas]{.underline} and the
fact that pathways like SSP3--7.0 will reach CO2 concentrations
exceeding indoor air quality requirements [add **further confidence**
that we will **stay below**]{.underline} the SSP2-4.5 trajectory.

Yes, Lynas is correct that complex [**[feedback]{.mark}** mechanisms may
make the climate **more sensitive**]{.underline} to our greenhouse gas
emissions than we currently believe. [But the **uncertainty** band
continues to **narrow**]{.underline} as our understanding grows.
Currently, the 90% certainty band around 2.5 °C is ±0.7 °C. In other
words, [there's a **[5% likelihood]{.mark}** that we eventually **exceed
3.2 °C**]{.underline} if we follow what we now believe to be a 2.5 °C
pathway.

[The **very unlikely** scenario of unexpectedly **high** climate
**sensitivity**]{.underline} and negative surprises from tipping point
cascades [**cannot** be ignored]{.underline} due to the large potential
impact. However, as this follow-up article explores, comparable risks
emerge from the drastic decarbonization pathways advocated to mitigate
these climate risks, so we will have to accept the possibility of
low-likelihood, high-impact events either way.

Accordingly, the primary question is [whether we can **live
comfortably** with **2--3 °C**]{.underline} of global temperature rise.
The new version of Six Degrees has [convinced me that **we certainly
can**]{.underline}.

Life in a 2--3 °C Warmer World

Six Degrees gives an admirable overview of the available literature on
the potential impacts of climate change. Below, I will summarize how the
main impacts will play out over this century. In each case, I will
strive to bring balance to the alarmist tone in Six Degrees using other
reputable sources, largely the latest IPCC reports.

Sea level rise

Next to extreme weather, [**rising oceans** are probably the **most
recognized** symbol]{.underline} of the climate crisis narrative. The
effects are certainly significant, with about 100 million people (1% of
the global population) being displaced by the end of the century in a
2--3 °C warmer world if we do not build coastal protection. Furthermore,
some small island nations may need to be abandoned as rising seas
salinate groundwater.

In the long run, [**3 °C** of warming could lead to about **10 m** of
**sea level rise**]{.underline}, driven largely by the melting of the
Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. As shown below, 10 m of sea
level rise will only [consume a **small fraction** of available
land]{.underline}. However, if the change happens rapidly, it would have
a very large impact because so many people live near the ocean.

Images showing the effect of 10 m of sea level rise on the coast of
South East Asia \| Climate Central

[Luckily, **[sea level rise]{.mark}** is a **[very slow]{.mark}**
process]{.underline}. As the IPCC shows below, a 3 °C scenario (SSP2)
[needs about [**140 years** for **every meter**]{.mark} of rising
oceans]{.underline}. Surely, [[we can **adapt**]{.mark} to oceans rising
**less than 1 cm**]{.underline} per year.

A summary of sea level rise findings from the IPCC

There are [two main **adaptation** pathways: **coastal protection** and
**gradual retreat**]{.underline}. In low-lying regions where a dyke can
protect large areas of land, coastal protection would be preferable.
Although Lynas correctly points out the catastrophic risk of dyke
collapse in such a scenario, experience from the Netherlands shows that
[we can **manage** this risk]{.underline}.

If the amount of valuable land protected by dykes is insufficient, a
gradual retreat presents a simple and low-cost alternative. The
[**[timescales]{.mark}** involved in **sea level rise** are [so
long]{.mark} that [they **match**]{.mark} reasonably well with
**[building infra]{.mark}**structure lifetimes]{.underline}. Hence,
intelligent planning can allow cities to retreat before slowly advancing
coastlines without having to sacrifice infrastructure that still has
economic value. It can even be beneficial if we are forced to constantly
modernize our cities in this manner (e.g., rebuild cities for people,
not for cars).

Yes, there are some [**[outlier]{.mark}** assessments projecting **rapid
rises**]{.underline} caused by self-strengthening collapses of the
Greenland and West-Antarctic ice sheets (see the dashed red lines in the
figure above). We will know soon enough if these projections hold any
water, and if they do, we will know that we will have to adapt faster at
a higher cost. [But these [are **low-likelihood**]{.mark} cases, even on
the **crazy emissions** pathway]{.underline} of the SSP5--8.5 scenario,
so [they certainly [do **not justify**]{.mark} the enormous costs of
**[desperate climate]{.mark}** action.]{.underline}

Water cycles

Since hotter air can hold more water, a [warmer planet intensifies
**[hydro]{.mark}**logical **[cycles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, driving
changes in precipitation patterns. This will [**benefit some** regions
and hurt others]{.underline}, which can certainly be problematic if the
change happens quickly.

South Europe may experience the greatest drought shock, with most other
regions projected to experience greater drought already being dry,
sparsely populated, and adapted for such a climate.

The change in consecutive dry days in a 3 °C scenario from the IPCC
Interactive Atlas

On the flip side, flood risk will increase in the monsoon region, with
each degree of temperature rise causing about 10% greater rainfall
intensity.

The change in maximum 5-day precipitation in a 3 °C scenario from the
IPCC Interactive Atlas

The projected [changes in **precipitation** patterns are **[quite
mild]{.mark}** in a **2--3 °C** warmer world, and
**well-[adapted]{.mark}** [societies]{.mark} can certainly still
**[thrive]{.mark}**]{.underline} throughout the world. However, if
adaptation happens too slowly, impacts in regions like South Europe and
South Asia can be quite disruptive.

In this case, [the **rate of change** is more important than the
**magnitude**]{.underline}, a theme that will recur frequently in the
sections below. The implication of this observation is that we should
prioritize more practical partial decarbonization options over the
impractical net-zero ideology --- a critical point I will explore
further in a follow-up article.

Regardless of the rate of change, proactive adaptation is key. For
example, there are many millions of people already living under the more
arid conditions projected for South Europe. Hence, the world has no
shortage of practical experience to share, and the transition can be
quite smooth if this experience is proactively implemented where needed.

Natural disasters

[[**Lynas** says little about **extreme weather**]{.mark} in the
**two**-degrees and **three**-degrees]{.underline} chapters, except that
changes from shifting jet streams and more frequent El Niños and La
Niñas remain subtle at these levels.

Still, [**sensationalist** reporting]{.underline} linking extreme
weather events and other natural disasters to climate change [spreads so
much **needless alarm**]{.underline} that this section deserves a few
additional paragraphs.

The most important concept that must be understood is the expanding
bullseye effect. Because of the great economic expansion facilitated by
fossil fuels, the mass of infrastructure available to be damaged by
extreme weather has greatly increased. Thus, the highly touted rising
economic costs of natural disasters should come as no surprise.

But absolute economic damages is the wrong metric. Instead, we should
adjust damages with economic output, which is a reasonable proxy for the
amount of valuable capital available to be damaged by extreme weather
events. As shown below, this trend is actually slightly down, showing
that our ability to insulate our economies against natural disasters is
outpacing any exacerbating effects of climate change.

The relative cost of natural disasters to the global economy \| Our
World in Data and World Bank

[The efficacy of **economic development** as a climate
adaptation]{.underline} mechanism is even [more **powerfully
illustrated** by the precipitous [**decline** in deaths from]{.mark}
**natural [disasters]{.mark}** over the last century]{.underline}. As
shown below, any [**[negative effects]{.mark}** from climate change have
been totally [**overpowered** by]{.mark} the **[positive
effect]{.mark}** of the climate **resilience**]{.underline} created by a
growing economy.

Population-adjusted deaths from natural disasters \| Our World in Data

These simple graphs painfully expose the irresponsible sensationalist
reporting around supposedly climate-induced natural disasters. It is a
terrible journalistic practice that has to stop.

Extreme temperatures

**[[Extreme heat]{.underline}]{.mark}** presents another example where
the [**rate of change** is more important than the
**magnitude**]{.underline}. [Climate **[zones]{.mark}** are currently
[moving]{.mark} about **[20 km]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward the poles
[[each year]{.underline}]{.mark}. Put another way, cities in a 3 °C
world will be exposed to temperature conditions currently found about
1000 km toward the equator. Obviously, [[humans]{.mark} can live (and
[**live well**) under]{.mark} such **[conditions]{.mark}** when
communities are properly **adapted**]{.underline} to the local climate,
but adaptation can become difficult if the rate of change is too large.

The change in the maximum temperature of the hottest days in a 3 °C
scenario from the IPCC Interactive Atlas

However, a critical element that [climate [alarmists]{.mark} (including
Mark **Lynas**) regularly **[fail to mention]{.mark}** is that global
**[warming]{.mark}** does a lot to [**alleviate** suffering]{.mark} from
cold]{.underline}. [Humans are far better **adapted** to **tolerate
heat** than cold]{.underline} (we can sweat across a large skin area for
effective cooling but have no fur or blubber layer to keep us warm).
Hence, it should come as no surprise that research finds that the
[**warming** climate has thus far **saved** about **ten lives** by
reducing **cold** for every life it took]{.underline} through excessive
heat, avoiding about half a million deaths each year.

A distribution of excess deaths from cold and heat around the world
(note the vast difference in the scales of the two maps) \| Zhao, et al.

Lynas also points out that air conditioning will become more important
(and energy-hungry) as the number of people requiring this technology to
remain healthy and productive increases. However, he again fails to
mention the flip side: less space and water heating. Comparing the rise
in cooling degree days to the fall in heating degree days on the IPCC
Interactive Atlas once again shows that the [**benefit** of generally
warmer temperatures **outweighs** the costs]{.underline}.

Overall, a warmer planet [stabilized **2--3 °C**]{.underline} above
pre-industrial levels could [make a **more comfortable**
home]{.underline} for Homo sapiens. The only concern is whether we can
limit the rate of change and boost the rate of adaptation sufficiently
to avoid serious problems in the transition phase.

**[[Ag]{.mark}ricultural output]{.underline}**

The changing [climate]{.underline} is already [causing problems for
**farmers**]{.underline}. As climate zones continue their 20 km/year
poleward march, farms that once occupied prime real estate are now
becoming less productive. Thus far, [the [effect is **small**]{.mark}
(in the order of a [**1% yield** reduction]{.mark})]{.underline}, but it
seems clear that the negative effect of changing local climates
outweighs the positive effect of CO2 fertilization for the global
agricultural sector.

Due to its ongoing population boom and high poverty incidence, Africa is
of particular concern. On this already hot and arid continent, the 5 °C
warmer maximum temperatures projected for a three-degree world are
expected to do considerable harm to agricultural output, potentially
triggering mass migrations. It will also prevent subsistence farmers
from working their fields on the hottest days.

That said, [**history** has repeatedly proven predictions of
**[food]{.mark}-related** global [calamities **woefully
wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, food production per capita has
increased by 25% over the last 50 years despite the population more than
doubling. However, the stagnation in African food supply is concerning.

Global food availability trends are still moving upward \| Our World in
Data

On a global level, it is unquestionable that too many calories cause
vastly more death and suffering than too few. As shown below, obesity is
currently linked to 8.5% of global deaths (5.7 million people). In
contrast, protein-energy malnutrition causes 0.2 million annual deaths.

The rapidly escalating global obesity epidemic \| Our World in Data

From this data, it is clear that a couple of percentage points of
[climate-related **yield loss** from the global **agricultural sector**
may well **save** many **more lives** than it takes]{.underline}. Thus,
the main risk is not one of total food supply, but one of immorally
unequal food distribution. As an example of our terrible performance in
this respect, the rich world currently spends as much trying to lose
weight as would be needed to eradicate world hunger.

In simple terms, the best adaptation strategy to combat the projected
population- and climate-related food shortages in Africa is for the rest
of the world (the West especially) to simply grow a heart. A fraction of
the food that ends up in waste bins and dangerously obese rich-world
bodies can easily solve world hunger, even in a three-degree world.

Of course, the [**agricultural** sector also has many climate
**adaptation**]{.underline} mechanisms at its disposal. Most
prominently, [[farmers]{.mark} can **[adapt]{.mark}** their
**[crops]{.mark}** to the changing **climate**]{.underline}, and
agricultural zones can slowly migrate poleward. Here, we again encounter
the critical point that the rate of change is more important than the
magnitude. A world fully adapted to 2--3 °C of warming with optimized
agricultural zones established about 1000 km toward the poles can
produce more than enough food (further boosted by CO2 fertilization),
but there are clear limits to how rapidly this migration can take place,
so the transition must be carefully managed.

**[Ecosystem losses]{.underline}**

Lastly, we encounter perhaps the best example of how the rate of climate
change is more important than the magnitude. While nature is highly
adaptable and has flourished during times when the planet was much
warmer than 2--3 °C above pre-industrial levels, it cannot keep up with
the rate of anthropogenic climate change.

Studies suggest that 26% of insects, 19% of amphibians, 14% of reptiles,
12% of mammals, and 11% of birds will lose at least half their climate
ranges on an emissions trajectory resulting in a 2 °C temperature rise
by 2100. These numbers approximately double in a 3 °C scenario. In the
oceans, each degree of temperature rise is projected to reduce total
living biomass by about 5%.

Two highly diverse ecosystems are of particular concern: coral reefs and
the Amazon rainforest. Shallow-water corals are particularly sensitive
to rising temperatures and will see drastic declines in a 2--3 °C warmer
world. The fate of the Amazon is still hotly debated, with some saying
it should be safe well above 4 °C and others seeing tipping points below
3 °C. Reassuringly, the IPCC assigns a low probability to an Amazon
dieback tipping point being crossed in the 21st century.

But once again, it is important to bring some balance to the discussion.
As shown below, [**climate** change is **far** from being the
only]{.underline} (or even the most important) [**threat** to
ecosystems]{.underline} around the world.

Graph depicting the classification of threats to species monitored on
the IUCN Red List

Furthermore, [there is **[a lot]{.mark}** that can be done to
**[minimize]{.mark}** climate impacts on
**[biod]{.mark}**iversity]{.underline}. Lynas discusses several of these
in Six Degrees, including [**assisted [migration]{.mark}**[, **habitat
restoration**]{.mark}, reducing hunting and agricultural pressures,
maintaining **[refuges]{.mark}**, and keeping [**seeds**, **eggs**, and
**DNA**]{.mark} for resurrecting lost species]{.underline}.

It's worth reiterating that, if we can keep ourselves to the SSP2--4.5
emissions trajectory (or even slightly below), we are currently
navigating the most challenging decades due to the rapid rate of change.
After 2050, the [**rate** of [temp]{.mark}erature [rise]{.mark} will
**[slow down]{.mark}** and approach **stagnation** by 2100]{.underline}.
At that point, [**[eco]{.mark}system** [pressures]{.mark} will be
**[considerably lower]{.mark}**]{.underline} than they are today
[because climate **zones** will **no longer** be shifting]{.underline},
allowing nature to catch up and settle down into a new equilibrium.

The rate of global temperature rise in realistic emission trajectories
(SSP2--4.5 or below) slows considerably after mid-century \| IPCC

Our job is to limit the rate of change and manage the transition period
as best we can. If we do this reasonably well, [nature will
**thrive**]{.underline} in the 22nd century and beyond.

Our Best Adaptation Strategy

As discussed above, [the **2--3 °C** [warmer world]{.mark}]{.underline}
we will leave our 22nd-century descendants [is [**nothing** to be
**afraid** of]{.mark}]{.underline}, although some of the changes we
would need to make on the way there will be uncomfortable. In fact, it
would not surprise me one bit if the 22nd-century society decides to
stay in a stabilized two-degree world instead of making another
troublesome journey back to pre-industrial temperatures.

#### Alarmism is rooted in [biased activism]{.underline} that [ignores scientific shortfalls]{.underline}.

The Science. "We're all supposed to know what "The Science says. ["The
Science,"]{.underline} we're told, [is **settled**]{.underline}. How
many times have you heard it? [Humans have]{.underline} already
[**broken** the]{.underline} earth's [climate. **Temp**eratures are
rising, **sea level** is surging, ice is disappearing, and heat waves,
storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires are]{.underline} an
[ever-**worsening**]{.underline} scourge on the world.
[**G**reen**h**ouse **g**as **emissions** are causing **all** of this.
And unless]{.underline} they're [**eliminated promptly** by radical
changes]{.underline} to society [and its energy systems, "The Science"
says Earth is **doomed**]{.underline}.

[Well \... **not quite**]{.underline}. Yes, it\'s true that the globe is
warming, and that humans are exerting a warming influence upon it. But
beyond that-to paraphrase the classic movie The Princess Bride: \"I do
not think \'The Science\' says what you think it says.\"

For example, [both the **[research lit]{.mark}**erature [and
**gov**]{.mark}ernment **[reports]{.mark}** that summarize and assess
the state of climate science [say **clearly** that
heat]{.mark}]{.underline} waves in the US are [now [**no** more
**common** than]{.mark} they were in **[1900]{.mark}**, and that the
warmest **[temp]{.mark}**eratures]{.underline} in the US [have [**not
risen** in]{.mark} the past **[fifty years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When
I tell people this, most are incredulous. Some gasp. And some get
downright hostile.

But these are almost certainly not the only climate facts you haven\'t
heard. Here are three more that might surprise you, drawn directly from
recent published research or the latest assessments of climate science
published by the US government and the UN:

- Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past
  century.

- Greenland\'s ice sheet isn\'t shrinking any more rapidly today than it
  was eighty years ago.

- The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be
  minimal through at least the end of this century.

So what gives?

If you\'re like most people, after the surprise wears off, you\'ll
wonder why you\'re surprised. Why haven\'t you heard these facts before?
Why don\'t they line up with the narrative-now almost a meme-that we\'ve
already broken the climate and face certain doom unless we change our
ways?

Most of [the [**disconnect** comes from]{.mark} the **long
[game]{.mark}** [of **telephone**]{.mark} that starts with the
**research lit**erature]{.underline} and [runs through the **assessment
reports** to the **summaries** of the assessment reports]{.underline}
and [on to]{.underline} the [**media** coverage. [There are]{.mark}
**abundant [opportunities]{.mark}** [to get things
wrong]{.mark}]{.underline}-both [**accident**ally and **[on
purpose]{.mark}**]{.underline}- [[as]{.mark} the
**[info]{.mark}**rmation [goes through **filter**]{.mark} **after
filter** to be packaged]{.underline} for various audiences. The public
gets their climate information almost exclusively from the media; very
few people actually read the assessment summaries, let alone the reports
and research papers themselves. That\'s perfectly understandable-the
data and analyses are nearly impenetrable for non-experts, and the
writing is not exactly gripping. As a result, most people don\'t get the
whole story.

But don\'t feel bad. It\'s not only the public that\'s ill informed
about what the science says about climate. Policymakers, too, have to
rely on information that\'s been put through several different wringers
by the time it gets to them. Because most government officials-and
others involved in climate policy for the public and private sectors-are
not themselves scientists, it\'s up to scientists to make sure that
non-scientists making key policy decisions get an accurate, complete,
and transparent picture of what\'s known (and unknown) about the
changing climate, one undistorted by \"agenda\" or \"narrative.\"
Unfortunately, getting that story straight isn\'t as easy as it sounds.

I should know. That used to be my job.

WHERE I\'M COMING FROM

I\'m a scientist-I work to understand the world through measurements and
observations, and then to communicate clearly both the excitement and
the implications of that understanding. Early in my career, I had great
fun doing this for esoteric phenomena in the realm of atoms and nuclei
using high-performance computer modeling (which is also an important
tool for much of climate science). But beginning in 2004, I spent about
a decade turning those same methods to the subject of climate and its
implications for energy technologies. I did this first as chief
scientist for the oil company BP, where I focused on advancing renewable
energy, and then as undersecretary for science in the Obama
administration\'s Department of Energy, where I helped guide the
government\'s investments in energy technologies and climate science. I
found great satisfaction in these roles, helping to define and catalyze
actions that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the agreed-upon
imperative that would \"save the planet.\"

But then the doubts began. In late 2013 I was asked by the American
Physical Society-the professional organization of the country\'s
physicists-to lead an update of its public statement on climate. As part
of that effort, in January 2014 I convened a workshop with a specific
objective-to \"stress test\" the state of cli- mate science. In ordinary
terms, that meant analyzing, critiquing, and summarizing humanity\'s
accumulated knowledge about the past, present, and future of the
earth\'s climate. Six leading climate experts and six leading
physicists, myself included, spent a day scrutinizing exactly what we
know about the climate system and how confidently we can project its
future. To focus the conversation, we physicists had spent the prior two
months preparing a framing document based on the UN assessment report
that had just been released.1 We posed some specific and crucial
questions along the lines of: Where is the data poor or the assumptions
weakly supported-and does that matter? How reliable are the models that
we use to describe the past and project the future? Many who\'ve read
the workshop transcript were struck by how successfully-and unusually-it
brought out the certainties and uncertainties of the science at that
time.2

For my part, I came away from the APS workshop not only surprised, but
shaken by the realization that [[climate science]{.mark} was [**far less
mature** than]{.mark}]{.underline} I had
**[[supposed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Here\'s what I discovered:

- [[Humans exert]{.mark} a]{.underline} growing, but [**physically
  [small]{.mark}**, warming [influence on]{.mark}]{.underline} the
  [[climate]{.mark}. The [**deficiencies** of]{.mark} climate [data
  **challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline} our [[**ability** to
  **untangle**]{.mark} the response to human [influences]{.mark} from
  **poorly understood** natural changes]{.underline}.

- [The [results from]{.mark} the multitude of [climate **models
  disagree**]{.mark} with, [or even **contradict**]{.mark}, each other
  and **many**]{.underline} kinds of [observations]{.underline}. A vague
  \"expert judgment\" was sometimes applied to adjust model results and
  obfuscate shortcomings.

- Government and UN press releases and summaries do not accurately
  reflect the reports themselves. There was a consensus at the meeting
  on some important issues, but not at all the strong consensus the
  media promulgates. Distinguished climate experts (including report
  authors themselves) are embarrassed by some media portrayals of the
  science. This was somewhat shocking.

- In short, [the [science is **insufficient** to make]{.mark} **useful
  [projections]{.mark}** about how the climate will change over the
  coming decades, **much less** what **effect**]{.underline} our
  [**actions** will have on it]{.underline}.

Why were these crucial deficiencies such a revelation to me and others?
As a scientist, I felt the scientific community was letting the public
down by not telling the whole truth plainly. And as a citizen, I was
concerned that the public and political debates were being misinformed.
So I began to speak out, most publicly through a two-thousand-word
\"Saturday Essay\" published in the Wall Street Journal that September.3
In it, I outlined some of the uncertainties in climate science and
argued that ignoring them could hinder our ability to understand and
respond to a changing climate:

> Policy makers and the public may wish for the comfort of certainty in
> their climate science. But I fear that rigidly promulgating the idea
> that climate science is \"settled\" (or is a \"hoax\") demeans and
> chills the scientific enterprise, retarding its progress in these
> important matters. Uncertainty is a prime mover and motivator of
> science and must be faced head-on.

That piece drew thousands of online comments, the great majority of them
supportive. My frankness about the state of climate science was less
popular in the scientific community, however. As the chair of a highly
respected university earth sciences department told me privately, \"I
agree with pretty much everything you wrote, but I don\'t dare say that
in public.\"

Many scientific colleagues, some of them my friends for decades, were
outraged that I\'d highlight problems with The Science and thus, as one
of them said, \'give ammunition to the deniers.\" Another said it would
have been okay to publish my essay in some obscure scientific journal
but reproached me for doing so in a forum with so many readers. And a
prominent defender of the idea that The Science is settled enough
published a response to my Op-Ed that began by calling for New York
University to reconsider my employment, went on to misrepresent many of
the things I had written, but then, bafflingly, acknowledged that most
of the uncertainties I\'d mentioned were well known and much discussed
among experts.4 It seems that by highlighting those uncertainties so
plainly and publicly, I had inadvertently broken some code of silence,
like the Mafia\'s omerta.

More than six years of study since the APS workshop have left me
increasingly dismayed at the public discussions of climate and energy.
[Climate [alarmism]{.mark} has come to
**[dominate]{.mark}**]{.underline} US politics, especially among
Democrats, where I have otherwise long felt most comfortable
politically. The 2020 Democratic presidential primary saw each candidate
[[trying to **outdo**]{.underline}]{.mark} the other with
[[**over-the-top** statements]{.mark} about \"climate emergency\" and
\"climate crisis\" **increasingly divorced** from the
science]{.underline}. The election run-up also witnessed increasingly
sweeping policy proposals like the Green New Deal that would \"fight
climate change\" with government interventions and subsidies. Not
surprisingly, the Biden administration has made climate and energy a
major priority, with the appointment of former secretary of state John
Kerry as climate envoy and proposed spending of almost two trillion
dollars to fight this \"existential threat to humanity.\"

While I have no informed opinions on the fiscal and policy merits of
proposals like the Green New Deal-I am a physicist, not an economist-I
do know that any policy should be based upon what the science actually
says about the changing climate. Trillion-dollar decisions about
reducing human influences on the climate are, in the end, about values:
risk tolerance, intergenerational and geographical equities, and a
balance among economic development, environmental im- pact, and energy
cost, availability, and reliability. But they must be informed by an
accurate understanding of scientific certainties and uncertainties.

This book is an attempt to set us on the road to that understanding. And
I intend to do it the only way that a scientist knows how: with
documented facts, almost all drawn from the most up-to-date official
assessments or quality research literature, presented in their proper
context. As the late representative John Lewis, the conscience of
Congress, said in his speech about the first impeachment of President
Trump:5

> When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have
> a moral obligation to say something, do something.

My late Caltech colleague Richard Feynman was one of the greatest
physicists of the twentieth century, renowned for both the creativity
and importance of his research (including Nobel Prize-winning work on
quantum electrodynamics). Irreverence, showmanship, and the ability to
tell a good story were also part of what made him a legend. He was a
character, one with extraordinary intellectual substance.

I was one of many aspiring physicists attracted to Caltech by Feynman\'s
presence. Before I arrived in the fall of 1968, I had already read his
wonderful \"red book\" series of physics lectures cover to cover
multiple times. My four undergraduate years at Caltech were lived pretty
much as those depicted in The Big Bang Theory, except without the laugh
track. The highlights included some one-on-one conversations with
Feynman (he loved interacting with young scientists), as well as a
memorable session playing bongo drums with the great man himself during
my first year.

Scientific integrity is central to the Caltech ethos. Its importance is
impressed upon new students from their first day on campus, and
Feynman\'s absolute intellectual honesty demonstrated for students and
faculty alike what this means for a working scientist. At the 1974
Caltech commencement, he gave a now famous address titled \"Cargo Cult
Science.\" Its topic was the rigor scientists must adopt to avoid
fooling not only themselves, but also others:

> In summary, the idea is to try to give all of the information to help
> others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the
> information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or
> another.
>
> The easiest way to explain this idea is to contrast it, for example,

> through food. Well, that\'s true. It\'s not dishonest; but the thing
> I\'m talking about is not just a matter of not being dishonest, it\'s

> that should be added to that advertising statement is that no oils

Much of the public portrayal of [climate [science suffers from]{.mark}
**Feynman\'s [Wesson Oil]{.mark}**
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}-[[in]{.mark} an [effort to
**persuade**]{.mark} **rather** than **inform**, the
**[info]{.mark}**rmation presented **[withholds]{.mark}**]{.underline}
either [**essential [context]{.mark}** or what doesn\'t
\"**fit**.\"]{.underline} (And coincidentally, as with cooking oil,
it\'s mostly a matter of temperature.)

Most of the climate researchers I\'ve met pursue their work with the
objectivity and rigor that are the norm in every field of science. But
[because the **potential impact** of a changing [climate strikes at
**human existence**]{.mark} itself, the [issue]{.mark}]{.underline}
understandably [**[engenders passion]{.mark}** and emotion]{.underline}.
Some people argue that there\'s no harm in a bit of misinformation if it
helps \"save the planet,\" and indeed, when phrases like this (however
unwarranted or inaccurate) are being used to describe the stakes,
perhaps it isn\'t surprising that some [climate scientists are **less
than objective**]{.underline} when talking to the public. The late
Stephen Schneider, a prominent climate researcher, said it explicitly as
early as 1989 7:

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific
method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but-which means that we must include all the doubts, the
caveats, the ifs, ands, and buts. On the other hand, we are not just
scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we\'d like to
see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our
working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climatic change. To
do that we need to get some broad based support, to capture the
public\'s imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media
coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified,
dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might
have. This \"double ethical bind\" we frequently find ourselves in
cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right
balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means
being both. Many others have made similar points, or commented on the
dark side of Schneider\'s supposed \"double bind.\" For example: \"It
doesn\'t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is
true.\" -PAUL WATSON, COFOUNDER OF GREENPEACE 8 \"We\'ve got to ride
this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is
wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and
environmental policy.\" -TIMOTHY WIRTH, PRESIDENT OF THE UN FOUNDATION 9
\"Some colleagues who share some of my doubts argue that the only way to
get our society to change is to frighten people with the possibility of
a catastrophe, and that therefore it is all right and even necessary for
scientists to exaggerate. They tell me that my belief in open and honest
assessment is naïve.\" -DANIEL BOTKIN, FORMER CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL
STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAAT SANTA BARBARA10 And so the
media is filled with scary climate predictions. Here are a few old
enough to have been proven wrong: \"\[Inaction will cause\] \... by the
turn of the century \[2000\], an ecological catastrophe which will
witness devastation as complete, as irreversible as any nuclear
holocaust.\" -MOSTAFA TOLBA, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED
NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM, 1982 11 \"\[Within a few years\] winter
snowfall \[in the UK\] will become a very rare and exciting event.
Children just aren\'t going to know what snow is.\" -DAVID VINER, SENIOR
RESEARCH SCIENTIST, 2000 12 \"European cities will be plunged beneath
rising seas as Britain is plunged into a Siberian climate by 2020.\"
-MARK TOWNSEND AND PAUL HARRIS, QUOTING A PENTAGON REPORT IN THE
GUARDIAN, 200413 Although Schneider later spent many words trying to
explain his statement about the \"double ethical bind,\" I believe the
underlying premise is dangerously wrong. There should be no question
about \"what the right balance is between being effective and being
honest.\" It is the height of hubris for a scientist even to consider
deliberately misinforming policy discussions in service of what they
believe to be ethical. This would seem obvious in other contexts:
imagine the outcry if it were discovered that scientists were
misrepresenting data on birth control because of their religious
beliefs, for instance. Philip Handler, a former president of the
National Academy of Sciences, identified the problem in a 1980 editorial
that resonates eerily four decades later: Difficulty arises in the
scientific community from confusion of the role of scientist qua
scientist with that of scientist as citizen, confusion of the ethical
code of the scientist with the obligation of the citizen, blurring the
distinction between intrinsically scientific and intrinsically political
questions. When scientists fail to recognize these boundaries, their own
ideological beliefs, usually unspoken, easily becloud seemingly
scientific debate. 14

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

With scientists\' unique role comes a special responsibility. We\'re the
only people who can bring objective science to the discussion, and that
is our overriding ethical obligation. Like judges, we\'re obligated to
put personal feelings aside as we do our job. When we fail to do this,
we usurp the public\'s right to make in- formed choices and undermine
their confidence in the entire scientific enterprise. [There\'s nothing
at all wrong with scientists as [activists]{.mark}, but **activism
[masquerading]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} The [Science]{.mark} is
**pernicious**]{.underline}.

#### [Adaptation]{.underline} is [guaranteed]{.underline}, [zeroing]{.underline} the impact.

[It's easy [to construct **climate disasters**. You]{.mark} just [find
a]{.mark} current, disconcerting [trend and **project it**]{.mark} into
the future, while [**ignoring** everything]{.mark} humanity could do [to
**adapt**]{.mark}. For instance]{.underline}, one widely reported study
found that **[heat waves]{.underline}** could kill thousands more
Americans by the end of the century if global warming continues
apace---but only if you assume people won't use more air conditioning.
[Yes, the [climate is]{.mark} likely [to change, but **so is
human**]{.mark} **behavior** in **[response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Adaptation doesn't make the cost of global warming go away entirely,
but it does **reduce it dramatically**]{.underline}. Higher temperatures
will shrink harvests if [farmers]{.underline} keep growing the same
crops, but [they're likely to **adapt** by growing other varieties or
different plants altogether]{.underline}. Corn [production]{.underline}
in North America has **[shift]{.underline}**ed away from the Southeast
toward the Upper Midwest, where farmers take advantage of longer growing
seasons and less-frequent extreme heat. [[When sea levels rise,
governments build **defenses**]{.mark}---like the levees, flood walls
and drainage systems]{.underline} that protected New Orleans from much
of Hurricane Ida's ferocity this year.

[Nonetheless, many]{.underline} in the media [push **unrealistic
projections** of climate catastrophes, while **ignoring** adaptation. A
new study documents how the **biggest [bias]{.mark}** [in
studies]{.mark} on the rise of sea levels [is]{.mark} their [tendency to
ignore]{.mark} human [adaptation, **exaggerating**]{.mark} flood
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2100 [by as much as **[1,300
times]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also evident in the breathless tone
of most reporting: The Washington Post frets that sea level rise could
"make 187 million people homeless," CNN fears an "underwater future,"
and USA Today agonizes over tens of trillions of dollars in projected
annual flood damage. All three rely on [studies]{.underline} that
[**implausibly** assume no society]{.underline} across the world [will
make]{.underline} any [adaptation]{.underline} whatever for the rest of
the century. [This isn't **reporting** but
**scaremongering**]{.underline}.

You can see how far from reality these sorts of projections are in one
heavily cited study, depicted in the graph nearby If you assume no
society will adapt to any sea-level rise between now and 2100, you'll
find that vast areas of the world will be routinely flooded, causing
\$55 trillion in damage annually in 2100 (expressed in 2005 dollars), or
about 5% of global gross domestic product. But as the study emphasizes,
[["in **reality**]{.mark}, societies are **likely** to
adapt."]{.underline}

By raising the height of dikes, the study shows that [[humanity]{.mark}
can **[negate]{.mark}** almost [**all** that]{.mark} terrible
**projected [damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 2100. Only 15,000 people
would be flooded every year, which is a remarkable improvement compared
with the 3.4 million people flooded in 2000. The total cost of damage,
investments in new dikes, and maintenance costs of existing dikes will
fall sixfold between now and 2100 to 0.008% of world GDP.

Adaptation is much more effective than climate regulations at staving
off flood risks. Compare the two types of policies in isolation. Without
any climate mitigation to help, dikes would still safeguard more than
99.99% of the flood victims you'd see if global warming continued on
current trends. Instead of 187 million people flooded in 2100, there
would be only 15,000. Climate policy achieves much less on its own.
Without adaptation, even stringent regulations that keep the global
temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius would reduce the number of
flood victims only down to 85 million a year by the end of the century.

Stringent climate policy still has only a mild effect when used in
concert with dikes: Instead of the 15,000 flood victims you'd get with
only adaptation, you'd have 10,000. And getting there would cost
hundreds of trillions of dollars, which is hardly mitigated by the \$40
billion drop in total flood damage and dike costs climate regulations
would achieve. As I've explained in these pages before, this kind of
policy has a high human cost: the tens of millions of people pricey
climate regulations relegate to poverty.

You don't have to portend doom to take climate change seriously.

First, the good news: [**[climate scientists]{.mark}**, as a whole, are
[**not** warning us]{.mark} to prepare [for]{.mark} the
[apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The **[most recent]{.mark}** report
of the]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark}**)---a group of hundreds of scientists
working with the United Nations to analyze climate change research from
around the world---[[names]{.underline}]{.mark} many serious [**risks**
brought on by the **warming**]{.underline} of our planet, but [[human
**extinction** is not **among** them]{.underline}]{.mark}.1

"If I had to rate odds, I would say [the [chances of **climate**]{.mark}
**change** [driving us to]{.mark} the point of human
**[extinction]{.mark}** are [very low, if not **zero**]{.mark}," says
Adam **[Schlosser]{.mark}**, the Deputy Director of the **MIT** Joint
Program on the **Science** and Policy of Global Change and a **climate

impact on human societies.

In some ways, [the [most **recent climate science**]{.mark} even
[shows]{.mark} some **[encouraging trends]{.mark}**]{.underline}. IPCC
reports have always spelled out different scenarios for the amount of
climate-altering greenhouse gases humans will put into the atmosphere,
to show a range of possible climate risks the world may face. The IPCC
calls these scenarios "representative concentration pathways" (RCPs),
and they range from the relatively mild RCP2.6 scenario all the way up
to RCP8.5, whose risks would be calamitous.

But as [the [world]{.mark} has [made **progress**]{.mark} in recent
years on switching to **clean energy**]{.underline} and controlling our
greenhouse gas emissions, [it has [become **clearer**]{.mark} that [we
are **not**]{.mark}, in fact, [headed toward]{.mark} the [**worst-case**
scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline}. "RCP8.5 is being viewed more and more as
an extreme outcome," says Schlosser. Even with no further progress on
climate action, he says, the less-dire RCP6.0 scenario now looks closest
to reality.

### Warming\-\--No Impact\-\--AT: Climate Wars\-\--2NC

#### [No climate wars]{.underline} AND they'd be [localized]{.underline} and [easily]{.underline} defused.

**Gleditsch '21** \[Nils Petter; 2021; Ph.D. and Research Professor at
PRIO, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the Norwegian
University of Science and Technology, and former Editor of the Journal
of Peace Research; Journal of Peace Research, "This Time is Different!
Or is it? NeoMalthusians and Environmental Optimists in the Age of
Climate Change" Volume 58, Issue 1, Sage Journals\]

While the concern for the effects of global warming is new,
[the]{.underline} underlying [argument about]{.underline} armed
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} and other social consequences
[[bears]{.mark} extensive [similarities to]{.mark} the traditional
**[neoMalthusian argument]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, as Meierding
(2013: 186) points out, 'quantitative [climate change--conflict
researchers]{.underline} usually [import arguments from
earlier]{.underline} environmental conflict [studies]{.underline} or
from the civil wars literature' and the same would seem to apply to the
non-quantitative literature as well. Once again, even though climate
change is not a traditional pollution issue, [the fear of]{.underline}
developing [[**scarcities** is]{.mark} at [the
**core**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [IPCC reports that a warmer climate
will lead to]{.underline} more [drought]{.underline} and be detrimental
to agriculture, particularly rain-fed agriculture in Africa and the
Middle East. Excessive temperatures may drive people away from their
traditional homelands and force them to become migrants, leading to
competition for scarce resources in their countries of arrival. Other
parts of the world may be more affected by excessive rainfall, leading
to [floods]{.underline} that will negatively affect human habitation and
livelihoods. More generally, a warmer climate will increase the
probability of natural [disasters]{.underline} such as storms and
hurricanes. Rising sea levels will threaten low-lying areas as well as
coastal cities and may make small low-altitude islands uninhabitable.
The warming of the oceans will also impact the world's fisheries, with
possible consequences for another important component of [food
security]{.underline} (IPCC, 2019b).

The first reports from the IPCC paid little direct attention to armed
conflict. The Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 2001) made a few references
to the potential for climate change-induced conflict, mainly water wars,
conflicts generated by migration, and resource wars. The report had a
weak basis in peer-reviewed literature. The Fourth Assessment Report
(IPCC, 2007) contained even fewer references to armed conflict. The
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) included a chapter on human security with
a 4.5-page section on conflict, which noted that 'collectively the
research does not conclude that there is a strong positive relationship
between warming and armed conflict' (IPCC, 2014: 772). The report also
noted 'high agreement' that 'in the specific circumstances where other
risk factors are extremely low \[...\], the impact of changes in climate
on armed conflict is negligible.' The Africa chapter noted the
possibility of water conflict. A chapter labeled 'Detection and
attribution', devoted to assessing the robustness of relationships
reported in other chapters, dismissed the link from climate change to
violence out of hand. More recent reports from IPCC do not deal
extensively with armed conflict, although it is briefly mentioned in the
special reports on the impact of 1.5° global warming (IPCC, 2019a: 245),
on the oceans (2019b: 30), and on land use (2019c: 23, 25), and neither
will AR6 (IPCC, 2021).

While there is wide agreement that climate change poses large challenges
to human security in a broad sense (IPCC, 2014, WG II: Ch. 12), [the
[academic **lit**]{.mark}erature on climate change and armed conflict
[remains **divided**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Koubi, 2019; Mach et al.,
2019). [A common feature]{.underline} in most of the relevant research
[is that hypotheses about increasing scarcities]{.underline} provide the
starting point regardless of whether the authors conclude in favor of a
positive relationship or not. Key scarcities are reductions in arable
land and a declining supply of food, fresh water, and the yield of
fisheries. Important mechanisms assumed to generate increased scarcity
from climate change are cross-border migration, domestic rural-to-urban
migration, rising inequalities, interethnic tensions, climate changes
that affect different groups unequally, pre-existing competition for
scarce goods, competing claims to resources, and the response or lack of
response of national and international authorities.

In this special issue, Mach & Kraan (2021) focus on interactions between
science and policy. All the other articles feature emerging or
increasing scarcities (mostly within but also between nations) as key
mechanisms in translating climate change into violence and armed
conflict, frequently through involuntary migration. Other links could of
course have been hypothesized. If climate change were to lead to greater
abundance in some areas (despite an overall decline), groups could have
been assumed to fight over increased spoils, as in models of conflict
driven by opportunity rather than grievance (Collier & Hoeffler, 2004).
Alternatively, the link between climate change and violence could have
been derived from the literature on heat and aggression (Anderson,
2012), which suggests that higher temperatures will lead to physical
violence at the level of individuals and groups. But in fact, the
academic work reported in this special issue is framed within a
grievance model of conflict, with scarcity as the main source of
grievance, as in the IPCC reports and in the earlier literature on
environmental change and conflict more generally. This also applies to
articles that study wider forms of human insecurity resulting from
climate change (such as Adger et al., 2021). That said, these articles
do not always take a neoMalthusian starting point, nor do they find
unqualified support for the scarcity model -- but the hypotheses tested
are generally about scarcities.

As noted by Busby (2021), climate change has become a prominent policy
concern for the international community. President Barack Obama, several
Secretaries-General of the UN, and other prominent figures have argued
that climate change is likely to increase the risk of violent conflict,
and similar concerns are widely voiced by the environmental movement.
The Extinction Rebellion lists sea-level rise, desertification, water
shortage, and crop failure as unprecedented effects of the present
climate and ecological disruptions.5 The environmental
[activist]{.underline} Greta Thunberg [claimed]{.underline}, in a
dramatic speech to the UN General Assembly, that because of climate
change, 'People are suffering. People are dying.'6 Public support can be
found even for quite extreme views. For instance, a YouGov poll in July
2019 found that a majority in the USA and nine European countries
thought that it was likely ('quite likely' or 'very likely') that
[climate change]{.underline} would cause small wars, around one-third
thought that it [would cause a new **world war**, and]{.underline} about
as many that it would result in the '**[extinction]{.underline}** of the
human race'.7 In ten countries in Asia, the pessimism was even more
pronounced.8 David Wallace-Wells (2019), in a book tellingly titled The
Uninhabitable Earth, attempts to demolish the line between alarmism and
realism. And because the effects of human-induced climate change are
quite unprecedented, there may be a limit to what can be learned by
looking to earlier environmental debates (Meierding, 2013: 200).

The optimists' responses to climate change

The most extreme contrarian position is, of course, to deny one or both
key conclusions of the IPCC: the reality of global warming or the human
contribution to it. However, most environmental optimists accept these
two key conclusions but raise other problems with the panel's discussion
of the social effects of climate change and even more so with popular
interpretations of the panel reports. For instance, Hausfather & Peters
(2020), by no means 'climate deniers', decry the common use of choosing
the high-risk RCP8.59 to illustrate 'business as usual' as misleading.

[The [causal chains]{.mark} from climate]{.underline} change [to
the]{.underline} proposed [effects on human beings [are **long** and
**complex**]{.mark}, and the [**uncertainty** increases **every
step**]{.mark} of the way]{.underline}. In the literature on the social
effects of climate change, including the IPCC reports, statements abound
that something 'may' lead to something else, or that a variable 'is
sensitive to' another, without any guidelines for how to translate this
into probabilities (Gleditsch & Nordås, 2014: 87f). Uncritical use of
the precautionary principle, where any remotely possible calamity
unwittingly becomes a probable event, is not helpful.

Gleditsch & Nordås (2014: 85) note that while [AR5
([IPCC]{.mark}]{.underline}, 2014) [[did **not** find **strong
ev**]{.mark}**idence** [for a]{.mark} **direct [link]{.mark}** between
climate]{.underline} change [and conflict]{.underline}, it argued that
climate change is likely to impact known conflict-inducing factors like
poverty and inconsistent political institutions and therefore might have
an indirect effect on conflict. But this assumes that correlations are
transitive, which is not generally the case. If A correlates with B and
B with C, we know nothing about how A relates to C unless both
correlations are extremely high. The strongest case for the
climate--conflict link is the effect of interaction between climate
change and factors like poverty, state failure, or ethnic polarization.
It may be more cost-effective to try to deal with these other risk
factors than with global warming itself if the goal is to reduce the
'risk multiplier' effect of climate change on armed conflict.

The [[articles]{.underline}]{.mark} in this special issue [[do
not]{.mark} generally [see scarcity]{.mark} by **[itself]{.mark}** as
necessarily [resulting in]{.mark} **strongly negative**
[outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Factors like development, state failure,
and previous overload on ecosystems continue to play an important role
in that they interact with climate change to produce conflict and other
social outcomes. For instance, Ide, Kristensen & Bartuseviĉius (2021)
conclude that [the [impact]{.mark} of floods on]{.underline} political
[conflict [are **contingent** on other factors]{.mark} such as
population size and regime type]{.underline}. Moreover,
[most]{.underline} of the articles [do [not]{.mark} assume that
scarcities are likely to arise at the **[global]{.mark}** level. [They
may be **regional**]{.mark}]{.underline} (mostly [in
**Africa**]{.underline}), national, or local. Urban and rural areas may
be affected by different scarcities. Climate change may also affect
particularly strongly groups that are already at an economic or
political disadvantage. [The [effects can be **alleviated** and
**adapt**]{.mark}**ations constructed** [at **these
levels**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The argument about how climate change may indirectly impact conflict
leans heavily on]{.underline} the negative [economic
consequences]{.underline} of climate change, [but with]{.underline}
little or [**no reference** to the research that **explicitly** deals
with this topic]{.underline}. In fact, the relevant chapter in AR5
concluded that [for most sectors]{.underline} of the economy, [the
impact of climate change was likely to be **dwarfed** by **other
factors**]{.underline}. Tol (2018) finds that the long-term global
economic effects are likely to be negative, but that [a century of
climate change will have about the same impact on the economy as the
loss of **one year** of economic growth]{.underline}. Other economists
are more cautious, but the dean of climate change economics, William
Nordhaus (2018: 345, 359), estimates that 'damages are 2.1 percent of
global income at 3°C warming and 8.5 percent of income at 6°C', while
also warning that the longer the delay in taking decisive action, the
harsher the necessary countermeasures. Stern (2006) is more pessimistic,
based mainly on a lower discount rate (the interest rate used to
calculate the present value of future cash flows) as are Wagner &
Weitzman (2015). Heal (2017) argues that [the]{.underline} Integrated
Assessment [[Models]{.mark} generally used in the assessment of the
economics of climate change [are **not accurate**]{.mark} **enough** to
provide quantitative insights and should not be taken as serious
forecasts]{.underline}. Yet, [all]{.underline} these [[economists take
the]{.underline}]{.mark} basically [[**optimistic** view]{.mark} that
[climate]{.mark} change [is **manageable**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
appropriate policies for raising the price on the emission of greenhouse
gases. With a chapter heading from Wagner & Weitzman (2015: 17): 'We can
do this'.

Khalil **Ryan 24**, Policy Analyst @ Good Energy Collective whose main
area of work is introducing civil nuclear energy to nations seeking to
move away from the traditional carbon-based energy infrastructure
through partnerships with the United States civil nuclear export regime,
"Risen from the Ashes: The Rebirth of American Nuclear Leadership",
https://www.goodenergycollective.org/policy/risen-from-the-ashes

Is [[the U.S. **reigniting its drive**]{.underline} [to **lead the
world** into]{.underline}]{.mark} [a new era of **[civil nuclear
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}? [With its legacy of leadership in
nuclear diplomacy fading since the 1980s, [the U.S. **recently sought to
reenter the global stage** and **reclaim its role**]{.mark} as an
innovator and trendsetter in nuclear energy. In 2021, the Biden-Harris
Administration created the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible
Use of SMR Technology]{.underline} (FIRST) [program to support nations
seeking to meet their clean energy goals]{.underline}.1

[[The FIRST program]{.mark} is [a State-led initiative that
provides]{.mark} capacity-building [support for allied nations to help
facilitate]{.mark} the safe and responsible construction of small
modular reactors]{.underline} ([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}), [advanced
nuclear reactors]{.underline}2 [that generate 300 megawatts or less of
electricity]{.underline} (MWe) [per unit. [These]{.mark} collaborations
[provide **partner nations** with **advanced reactor
tech**]{.mark}**nology** and help develop a **robust civil nuclear
industry**]{.underline} [with a **highly skilled workforce** that
**meets or exceeds** international nuclear safety, security, and
nonproliferation standards. **[Over 40 nations have applied]{.mark}**
for the FIRST program, with another 17 on a waitlist]{.underline}.

Then, [in]{.underline} November [2022, the U.S. announced a new
program]{.underline}, **[Project Phoenix,]{.underline}** [which will
provide direct U.S. support for coal-to-SMR conversion feasibility
studies advancing Central and Eastern European energy security
goals.]{.underline} [This program]{.underline}, a collaboration between
Commerce's SMR Public-Private Program and State, [was initiated at a
critical juncture following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the related
disruption of Europe's natural gas supply]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} Nuclear Expediting the Energy Transition
(**[NEXT]{.underline}**) [program]{.underline}, a FIRST sub-program,
[and a NEXT One Stop Shop are for European and Eurasian countries
approaching SMR deployment decision points]{.underline}, with a suite of
advanced project preparation tools and services, including expert study
tours to visit U.S. nuclear facilities and access to an SMR simulator
for workforce development.

To date, [Project Phoenix's efforts have been primarily focused on
Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Projects include feasibility studies in
Slovenia, Slovakia, Czechia, and Poland. [By aiding these nations, the
U.S. can **satisfy national security objectives**]{.underline} [while
protecting the energy security of partner countries.]{.underline}

[To help finance potential projects in partner countries, State works
with the Trade and Development Agency, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM),
and the International Development Finance Corporation]{.underline} to
explore funding options. For example, [the Romania SMR feasibility
study]{.underline}, which would generate additional exports of American
services, [required cooperation with EXIM to hire additional engineers.
Projects under]{.underline} the [Phoenix]{.underline} initiative
[undergo extensive scrutiny through Front-End Engineering and Design
(FEED) studies]{.underline}, which estimate costs, technical
specifications, and procurement requirements. Around two-thirds of the
cost of these projects comes from engineering, procurement, and
construction; the remaining price tag is the construction of the nuclear
island of the plant.

[Several U.S. vendors and companies are also involved in Project
Phoenix, providing]{.underline} various [technology and procedure
options to the nations participating in the program]{.underline}. The
variety provided within the program enables nations to select the option
that best fits their needs or goals.

[[The initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} underneath the FIRST program
umbrella are the early steps that could [**[set the stage]{.underline}**
[for a **resurgence of American leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
the global nuclear space.]{.underline} **[[Implementing these]{.mark}
initiatives [has aided the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in its attempt
[to **reassert itself as a competitive**]{.mark} **and reliable
[option]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for nations seeking to **advance their
clean energy ambitions.**]{.underline}

the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report, "Even China Cannot
Rescue Nuclear Power from its Woes",
https://www.colorado.edu/cas/2022/04/12/even-china-cannot-rescue-nuclear-power-its-woes

[[What about China's role in nuclear]{.mark} power
**[elsewhere]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

[Nuclear]{.underline} power [features prominently in China's plans for
exports of energy technologies under the Belt and Road
Initiative]{.underline}. In February 2022, [China]{.underline} National
Nuclear Corporation [signed an agreement to build a nuclear plant in
Argentina]{.underline}. [This marks China's first export of a nuclear
reactor to a country other than Pakistan]{.underline} (with whom China
shares a special relationship that also extends to sharing nuclear
weapons and related military technology).

[But **[a swallow does not a summer make]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many
other nuclear reactor [vendors have won]{.mark} one or two]{.underline}
[**[contracts]{.underline}** [but have **not managed to translate that
into future orders**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [South Korea, which beat out
France in 2009 for the contract to build the UAE's first]{.underline}
nuclear power [plant, is perhaps the best example. Since that "victory",
South Korea has not won a single reactor export contract.]{.underline}

A different example is that of Russia, which has dominated the nuclear
export market since 2009. Following its attack on Ukraine and resultant
sanctions, many of Russia's contracts, including in Finland and in
Hungary, are likely to be cancelled if they have not already been.
Russia's ability to even complete the remaining contracts is also being
questioned.

[The future of the Argentina project is also **uncertain**]{.underline}.
Historically, [Argentina's commitment to new nuclear construction has an
**on-off character**]{.underline}. [In 2007, for example, the country
signed an agreement with Canada and China to construct a CANDU
reactor]{.underline}---**[which never happened]{.underline}**. [In 2015,
Argentina signed an agreement with China to build two nuclear plants.
**That, too, never happened**]{.underline}. The current agreement might
not come to fruition because [the Argentinian government is dealing with
high debt levels and is pushing China to fully finance construction of
this plant.]{.underline} Notwithstanding China's deep pockets, [there is
a limit to how many multi-billion dollar nuclear plants it can
finance---on top of all the other Belt and Road construction projects it
is involved in.]{.underline}

At a more basic level, [**[all countries]{.underline}** [have to contend
with the **uneconomical nature of nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[power [plants]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [whether it is Argentina or it
is any of the countries that had planned to import reactors from
Russia]{.underline} (for example, Bangladesh). [[If countries with
**decades of experience**]{.mark} with nuclear power [cannot make that
technology **competitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[odds that
**newcomers** will]{.mark} be able to do so [are **slim at
best.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Putting it all together

[Nuclear power in China has grown dramatically]{.underline} in the last
decade or more, in large part because of high level political decisions
to promote the technology even if it was not really technically or
economically justified. [This]{.underline} rapid expansion and the
ambitious targets announced by the Chinese nuclear establishment, [both
for domestic and foreign construction]{.underline}, have [led to the
expectation that China might give the nuclear industry a new lease on
life.]{.underline}

[These expectations are **at odds** with how [the energy sector is
**changing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially [due to rapid reductions
in the costs of **renewable**]{.mark} **energy
[tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline}. [Photovoltaic panels,]{.underline}
in particular, [have become dramatically cheaper]{.underline}, partly
because of China's role in manufacturing these. [This is why the
International Energy Agency dubbed solar energy the "**new king of
electricity**" in 2020. In contrast, [**nuclear** power costs have been
**increasing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These [trends **essentially
ensure**]{.mark} that **[nuclear capacity will continue to
decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [China's unstoppable capacity for
construction might shake the nuclear world, but it is **unlikely to
move**]{.underline}. However, each new reactor that is built will result
in additional risks and burdens, especially that of accidents leading to
widespread radioactive contamination, and dealing with radioactive
nuclear waste streams that remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of
years.

[While the U.S. has coasted on its laurels]{.underline}, with nuclear
energy production not changing much in over 30 years,
[**[Russia]{.underline}** [continues its]{.underline}]{.mark} [gradual
[climb upward]{.mark}]{.underline} and exports many reactors,
[while]{.underline} [**[China]{.underline}** [is investing
heavily]{.underline}]{.mark} [in civilian nuclear]{.underline} tech and
boosting its atomic power generation at home. Beijing plans to build 24
new nuclear power plants by 2030, bringing the total up to 60,
overtaking the U.S. with its old reactor fleet. For comparison, the U.S.
has 93 operational nuclear power plants in total, and in the same period
as China's building spree, the U.S. added 2 with none under development
now.

[[This]{.mark} decline [is **by choice**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S.
certainly used to have the technical and financial resources to compete
with Russia and China in these fields, but the political will to pursue
nuclear power (despite its overwhelmingly green characteristics (zero
CO2 emissions, and its exemplary safety record in North America) has
been lacking. The notorious Three Mile Island accident in 1979, killed,
injured, irradiated, or harmed zero people. Meanwhile, ballooning costs
and [[the]{.underline} **[nightmare that is America's
byzantine]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[environmental [review and permitting
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[resulted in the last]{.mark} nuclear
power [plant arriving **7 years late**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[17 billion]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[dollars [over
budget]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [It's **little surprise** the U.S. is
falling behind]{.underline}]{.mark} [in many nuclear areas.]{.underline}
"A generation of Americans were scared by Three Mile Island, and the
nuclear industry became a political and environmental target", said Jack
Edlow of Edlow International, a company that specializes in the global
transportation of nuclear materials and has been in the nuclear industry
for 55 years.

The average age of a nuclear reactor in the U.S. is 40 years old,
meaning Russia and China have been able to take advantage of (often
American) research into better reactors. The emerging technology of
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and advanced generation four reactors are
being embraced far quicker in China and Russia than in the U.S.

SMRs are a popular option to advance clean and safe production, as they
address multiple concerns about nuclear power. The ease of assembly and
transport of SMRs changes the construction of a reactor from a
multi-billion dollar, multi-year process into a shorter and cheaper
endeavor with timelier returns. SMRs also lower environmental risks due
to their anticipated reduced rate of accidents and lack of meltdown
potential due to innovative technology. Additionally, environmental and
aesthetic concerns are addressed by the ability of SMRs to be placed in
remote areas, or underground. Despite the promise of SMRs and platitudes
from the DOE on the subject, investments in SMRs lag far behind what is
needed.

Even with an updated fleet of reactors, the United States would still be
falling behind Russia in its supply of high-assay, low-enriched uranium
(HALEU), which is enriched up to 20% compared to the average 5% of
uranium used in current reactors to allow more efficient units to
function. The commercial supply of HALEU is currently controlled by
TENEX, a division of the state-owned Russian nuclear energy company
Rosatom. To bolster America's domestic production, the Biden
administration has put out an RFP for HALEU enrichment. The process of
building a domestic supply will be difficult to jumpstart with only one
U.S. company, Centrus Energy, being licensed to refine HALEU and one
European company, Urenco, planning to start production in New Mexico.
The RFP will allow many companies other than CENTRUS to bid for the new
plant operation but operation is not likely to occur until the late
2020s.

[[Building a new reactor is **uniquely difficult in the United
States**]{.underline} [due to its]{.underline}]{.mark} [own
**self-imposed [bureaucratic straight jacket]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[It takes]{.underline}]{.mark} [an average [3.2 years to generate
an]{.mark} environmental impact statement ([EIS]{.mark}) for a new
reactor]{.underline} -- **[that is [generate, not
process]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [There are]{.underline}]{.mark} [then
[**years** of]{.mark} **additional Nuclear Regulatory Commission
[hearings]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} officially [license **any
project**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [None of these concern
safety]{.underline} -- safety inspections occur independently of this
process and largely function as designed, lasting only months. [Then,
years of public hearings susceptible and often systematically captured
by private interests and militant environmentalists further delays
construction, **forcing the U.S. to burn coal and natural gas instead of
the clean atom.**]{.underline}

[What was once introduced to prevent government planners from running
roughshod over communities has become a tool of privileged interests to
block construction. This [over-regulation]{.mark} does not protect the
environment and **[deters private investment]{.mark}** in green

Nuclear Proliferation

In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that "no new nuclear
weapons states" should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst
Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation
should be "our number one national‐​security priority."5

[[There are]{.mark} good [reasons to **avoid
alarmism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this area, however. First, [the pace
of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [has been]{.mark} **far
[slow]{.mark}er** than has been **commonly predicted** primarily because
the [weapons convey **little advantage**]{.mark} **to their
possessor**]{.underline}. Second, [the **consequences** of such
[prolif]{.mark}eration that **[has]{.mark} taken place** have
[been]{.mark} **substantially [benign]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [those who
have acquired the weapons have "used" them simply to **stoke their
egos** or to **deter**]{.underline} real or imagined
**[threats]{.underline}**.6

And thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very
substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of
dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six
figures.

Pace

Alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear
proliferation. [[**Dozens** of]{.mark} **technologically
[capable]{.mark}** [countries have **considered**]{.mark} obtaining
nuclear [arsenals, but **very few have done
so**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed
out, even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have
proved to be too pessimistic.7 Thus, in 1958, the National Planning
Association predicted "a rapid rise in the number of atomic powers ...
by the mid‐​1960s."8 A few years later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted,
"Within, at the most, six years, China and several other states \[will\]
have a stock of nuclear bombs," and John Kennedy observed that there
might be "ten, fifteen, twenty" countries with a nuclear capacity by
1964.9

As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that nuclear
weapons would be important status --- or virility --- symbols;
therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to
show how "powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the
1960s, "No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.11 [Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits
insist on **extrapolating** from the **wrong cases**]{.underline}. A
more pertinent prototype would have been [Canada]{.underline}, a country
that **[could]{.underline}** easily [have had nuclear weapons by the
1960s but **declined to make the effort**]{.underline}.12 In fact, over
the decades, [[a **huge number**]{.mark} **of countries** capable of
developing nuclear weapons have **[neglected even to consider the
opportunity]{.mark}** --- for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway ---
even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan have **backed
away from** or **reversed** nuclear weapons programs, and Belarus,
Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually **surrendered** or
**dismantled** an **existing nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}.13 Some of
that reduction is no doubt due to the hostility of the nuclear nations,
but even without that, the Canadian case seems to have proved to have
rather general relevance.

To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [there is no "**technological
imperative**" for countries to **obtain nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
once they have achieved the technical capacity to do so.14 Moreover,
like military prowess in general, [the weapons have **not proved** to be
crucial status symbols]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis has observed,
"India, China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack
by developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have
increased their general prestige or influence."15 How much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? [Would anybody pay a
**great deal more attention** to Britain or France if their arsenals
held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay **much less** if they
had **none**? Did **China** need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its **economic growth?**]{.underline} Or with its Olympics? As
Jennifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe observe, "[Germany,
like]{.underline} its erstwhile Axis ally, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[has become powerful because of its **economic might** rather than its
**military might**]{.underline}, [and its **[renunciation of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** may even have **[reinforced]{.mark}
its [prestige]{.mark}**]{.underline}."16

[**[Decades of]{.mark} alarmist [predictions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}
proliferation **chains**, **[cascades]{.mark}**, **dominoes**,
**waves**, **avalanches**, **epidemics**, and **points of no return**
[have proved]{.mark} to be **[faulty]{.mark}**. The
[proli]{.mark}feration of nuclear weapons [has been]{.mark} **far
[slow]{.mark}er than routinely expected** because, insofar as most
**[leaders]{.mark} of most countries**]{.underline} ([even **rogue
ones**]{.underline}) have [considered acquiring the weapons, they have
come to [appreciate]{.mark} **several defects**]{.underline}: [the
[weapons are **dangerous**]{.mark}, **distasteful**, [**costly**,
and]{.mark} likely to **[rile the neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Moreover, as Jacques Hymans has demonstrated, [the [weapons have]{.mark}
also [been]{.mark} **[exceedingly difficult to obtain]{.mark}** for
**administratively dysfunctional countries** like
**Iran**]{.underline}.17

Consequences

Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during
which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in
nuclear proliferation, [the consequences of the proliferation that
**has** occurred have been **substantially benign**]{.underline}. [The
few [countries]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} the weapons [have proliferated
have **quietly kept them in storage**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and haven't
even found much benefit in **rattling them** from time to
time]{.underline}. And [even the **deterrence value** of the weapons has
been **questionable**]{.underline} --- [the major Cold War
participants]{.underline}, for example, [scarcely needed visions of
mushroom clouds to conclude that any replication of World War
II]{.underline}, with or without nuclear weapons, [was a **decidedly bad
idea**]{.underline}.18

Moreover, [[there has **never** been a]{.mark} **militarily
[compelling]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- or even minimally sensible ---
**[[reason]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to **use the
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly because of an
**inability** to **identify suitable targets**]{.underline} or ones that
could not be attacked about as **[effectively]{.underline}** by
conventional munitions. And [it is difficult to see how nuclear weapons
**benefited their possessors** in specific military ventures.
Israel's]{.underline} presumed [nuclear weapons **did not restrain** the
Arabs from attacking in **1973**]{.underline}, nor did Britain's prevent
Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied
forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of
Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.

Other analysts have sounded a much less alarmist tone, however. Some
scholars even suggested that **[a]{.underline}**n Iranian [[bomb]{.mark}

[an]{.underline} **[unbalanced]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}

Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that [[despite]{.mark} the **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the **[deterrent]{.mark}** they
provide]{.underline} should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other

1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that [because
nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a **[rare]{.mark}**
phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}

**[[net]{.mark} destabilising [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of new

[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts
regional and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. [The word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}**
[appears to suggest that the **established**]{.underline} nuclear
[powers have]{.underline} [**provide**d]{.underline} [other interested
nations with (at least a few) operational nuclear warheads.]{.underline}
**[Yet such transfers have [never]{.mark} been
[undertaken]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that sought
nuclear weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[all]{.underline}** these transfers
[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well [below]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}**, nations
seeking nuclear weapons always had to build them indigenously. Hence,
[in reality, the spread of nuclear weapons has meant that merely the
**ambition**]{.underline} [to possess a nuclear arsenal has
spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of which then had to
pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.

[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[many)
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[have]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}** nuclear
**[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, [[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the task]{.underline}, some
[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

Gavin, 2012a, p. 164; Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have
contended that because nuclear proliferation is such a rare phenomenon,
and since robust nonproliferation measures tend to be disruptive, the
net destabilising effect of new nuclear countries is quite small and,
therefore, manageable (Mueller 2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp.
293--296). The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising

[Despite the **popularity** of the **[nuclear domino
theory]{.mark}**]{.underline} among policymakers, [[the]{.mark}
**academic [lit]{.mark}erature** [has **turned against
it**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The reason is **obvious**: [**several
decades** of]{.mark} pessimistic proliferation [forecasts based on
**falling dominoes**]{.mark} were [proved **embarrassingly
wrong**]{.mark} by **history**]{.underline}. Moeed Yusuf notes that if
all the "first tier" suspects for nuclear acquisition identified in such
reports had become weapons states there would be nineteen nuclear powers
today (Yusuf 2009: 61). Instead, as noted above, [the number of
**technically capable** nuclear states has **grown**, while the number
of weapons states has **remained small**.]{.underline} Moreover, [there
was relatively little variation in the number of states in the
"exploration" or "pursuit" phases of nuclear programs during the Cold
War, **[despite]{.mark}** instances of [prolif]{.mark}eration [that
**ought to have caused domino behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the
Cold War, [[there has been a **striking decline in nuclear
interest**]{.mark}, as more states abandon their programs and fewer
states initiate new ones]{.underline} (Miller 2014a: 10--11).

The judgment of scholars has been scathing. Yusuf concludes that "an
evident shortcoming of historical predictions was their inability to
accurately estimate the pace of developments ... [the majority of
\[potential nuclear dominoes\] **never even came close** to **crossing
the threshold**]{.underline}. In fact, most did not even initiate a
weapons program" (Yusuf 2009: 61). John Mueller suggests that
projections of falling nuclear dominoes "have shown a want of prescience
that approaches the monumental---even the pathological ... \[[fear of a
**nuclear tipping point**]{.underline}\] [continues to flourish despite
the fact that it has **thus far proven** to be **almost entirely
wrong**]{.underline}" (Mueller 2009: 89). Francis [Gavin finds
**[no]{.mark}** "**[compelling ev]{.mark}idence** [that a]{.mark}
nuclear proliferation [chain reaction will **ever
occur**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Gavin 2009: 18). A two-volume study led
by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova cites a
"[**[consensus]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} the case study
[authors]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [that [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [spread
is neither **imminent** nor **likely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to involve
a]{.mark} process in which one country's pursuit of nuclear weapons
leads to a '**[chain reaction]{.mark}**' involving other
states]{.underline}" (Potter and Mukhatzhanova 2010: 337--338).

Research also suggests that [even where security concerns matter for
proliferation, their influence is more **diffuse** and
**complex**]{.underline} [than is **generally believed**]{.underline}.
Thus, [even where proliferation causes security fears, it **may not
beget more proliferation**]{.underline}. Phillip Bleek's [[**statistical
analysis** suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [nuclear
[acquisition]{.mark} by regional competitors [has]{.mark} **only a
modest effect** on state **exploration** of nuclear programs and [**no
impact** on whether they **pursue**]{.mark} **or acquire [an
arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contrast, a state's history of
conventional military disputes with its rivals strongly impacts all
three phases of nuclear development (Bleek 2010: 177). Bleek interprets
these results to mean, in part, that states seek nuclear weapons for a
particular sort of security---deterring attack, not because of security
competition in general. That conclusion is consistent with other recent
studies (Sechser and Fuhrmann 2013: 173--195). Thus, Bleek concludes
that his "[findings **strongly contradict** the conventional '**reactive
proliferation**' wisdom that **underpins widespread predictions** ... of
proliferation **cascades**, **dominoes**, **tipping points**, and the
**like**]{.underline}" (Bleek 2010: 179).

**dominate the area**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That argument was repeatedly
used with dramatic urgency for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam

[Exactly **how** that domination business is to be carried out is
**never made clear**]{.underline}.19 But [the notion apparently is that
[should an **atomic**]{.mark} **Iraq**]{.underline} (in earlier

[threatened states will make **common**]{.mark} **cause** with each
other [and]{.mark} with other **concerned countries** against the
threatening neighbor. It]{.underline} thus [seems overwhelmingly likely
that if a **nuclear Iran** brandishes its weapons]{.underline} to
intimidate others or to get its way, [it will find that those
threatened, rather than **capitulating**]{.underline} to its
blandishments [or **rushing off** to build a **compensating arsenal of
their own**]{.underline}, [will **[ally with
others]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([including conceivably
Israel]{.underline}) [[to **stand up to the

SMRs spark interest in Europe

Although a pioneer, [Romania is not the only country that wants to
benefit from this nuclear energy innovation. Several [countries in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[expressed **interest in SMR**]{.mark}
program[s as part of their **energy transition**]{.mark}
strategies]{.underline}. The [[European Commission announced]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} February [[2024]{.mark} that [it will
**launch** ]{.mark}**its own [reactors]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} the **early
[2030s]{.mark}**. Under the European Industrial Alliance, the European
executive body [selected **nine s**]{.mark}mall **[m]{.mark}**odular
**[r]{.mark}**eactor [**projects** to accelerate]{.mark} their
[deployment on the EU market]{.mark}]{.underline}, including two
lead-cooled fast reactors. The [[Polish Ministry]{.mark} of Climate and

technology of the American company GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy. [These
SMRs will be distributed across six sites and [are **scheduled to go

[While Romania and Poland are the most advanced in their SMR
implementation plans due to]{.underline} their [partnerships with
American companies, there are [European states]{.mark} that [have made
**commitments to develop** ]{.mark}**domestic SMR
[tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}. [[France]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
country with a strong nuclear energy tradition, [is scheduled to create
a unique and simplified SMR design--- NUWARD---through its state-owned
company]{.underline} Électricité de France (**[EDF]{.underline}**) and
deploy it in the early 2030s. The [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom [provided significant funding for the
**Rolls-Royce SMR program**]{.underline}, with plans for deployment in
the early 2030s. The [[Czech]{.mark} government has selected the
Rolls-Royce SMR as its preferred supplier in 2024]{.underline}, despite
earlier talks with the U.S.'s NuScale. [Countries like **[Estonia,
Bulgaria, and Sweden]{.mark}** are considering SMR technology to
**satisfy their industrial sector**'s energy needs, **enhance energy

U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, [[with a]{.mark} **target

\"[This site is]{.underline} now undeniably [ground zero for the nuclear
renaissance]{.underline},\" said Rick Springman, president of global
clean energy opportunities for Holtec.

[Two [new modular]{.mark} nuclear [reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}, dubbed
**[SMR-300s]{.underline}**, [[are planned]{.mark} for]{.underline}
co-location with the restarting Palisades plant [by 2030]{.underline}.
Each small modular reactor, or SMR, would generate approximately 300
megawatts of energy, enough to power about 300,000 homes, in addition to
the Palisades plant\'s 800 megawatts of generation.

[At a signing ceremony at the Palisades nuclear plant site]{.underline}
in Covert on Tuesday, [[Holtec]{.underline}]{.mark} officials [**[signed
a]{.mark} strategic [agreement]{.mark}** [with Hyundai]{.mark}
Engineering & Construction]{.underline}, a Korean-based leading global

[**built in North America** fo]{.mark}r a [national and international
client base]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

\"I believe [today will be recognized as the day when **new nuclear was
born**, in the form of small modular reactors]{.underline},\" said
Holtec CEO Kris Singh.

Nuclear power, with its high-volume, carbon-free energy production, is
getting a new look as many countries seek to meet significant carbon
emissions reduction goals to combat climate change. And the concept of
SMRs is getting global buy-in as a way to enable targeted, scalable
nuclear power generation without the huge upfront costs and construction
time of a full-scale nuclear power plant.

\"We do find in the United States and most countries of the world, the
need for power is insatiable,\" said Holtec International President
Kelly Trice.

\"If you look at power generation in this country over the next 40
years, there are areas of this country where (demand) is going to
quadruple. And you can\'t do it alone with wind and solar.

\"While nuclear power doesn\'t solve all of the problems of the
universe, it is very clean,\" he said. \"It is carbon-free, and it is
baseload full generation, 24/7 power.\"

[Holtec [has already **been at work** on the SMR-300 project **for over
a year**]{.mark}, doing **environmental studies**, including
**groundwater monitoring** and **soil borings**, to choose a
location]{.underline} on the Palisades property [for the first two SMR
modules. Some **[\$50 million has]{.mark} already [been
spent]{.mark}**]{.underline} on site development and environmental
activities, company officials said.

\'Victory in developing an ultrasafe reactor\'

The two SMR-300 units, in addition to the 600 megawatts of power they
would generate, would also create about 1 gigawatt of thermal power.

\"[The SMRs will be used]{.underline} not only [for electricity
generation but also]{.underline} for [providing steam to commercial
plant]{.underline}s, which you will see come around and be created in
this area,\" Singh said.

**r**eactors to better align with President **Trump\'s** bold agenda to

["America's nuclear energy renaissance starts now," said U.S. Secretary

U.S. electricity demand is forecast to soar in the coming years driven
by consumer needs, data center growth, increased AI use, and the
industrial sector's need for constant power.

Small modular reactors could provide reliable power for these
energy-intensive sectors, with the added benefit of flexible deployment
thanks to their compact size and modular design. Light-water small
modular reactors could also leverage the existing service and supply
chain supporting the country's current fleet of light-water reactors,
helping speed up the near-term deployment of new nuclear reactors.

\-\--pancakes!

Every now and then, the US government offers a huge subsidy to an
industry on grounds that make no sense to anyone with even basic
knowledge of the subject. The latest example, announced in June, is the
Army's Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) [program to
install **small reactors** on military bases]{.underline}, ostensibly
[to increase "energy **resilience**]{.underline}."

This [is **perplexing**]{.underline} for several reasons. First, such
[resilience can be provided much more **effectively**, **safely**, and
**cheaply** with **non-nuclear**]{.underline} options. Second, nuclear
reactors [themselves cannot provide "resilience]{.underline}," because
[their **safe** operation]{.underline} always has [require]{.underline}d
input of [electricity]{.underline} to the reactors [from
**other**]{.underline} power [sources]{.underline}. Third,
[the]{.underline} Army's planned [reactors would lack]{.underline} a
[robust **containment**]{.underline} building, [so an **attack** or
**accident** could disperse **radioactive waste**]{.underline},
endangering base personnel and neighboring civilians.

Both the Army and taxpayers should cry foul on this indefensible waste
of national security dollars.

Of course, energy resilience is a reasonable concern for Army bases,
which now get their electricity from the commercial [grid]{.underline}
that [is]{.underline} potentially [subject to **blackouts**]{.underline}
from bad weather or even cyberattacks. [The **simple** and
**inexpensive** solution]{.underline}, [**already** utilized by military
bases]{.underline} and other essential services including hospitals, [is
to maintain **backup**]{.underline} diesel [fuel and
generators]{.underline} for emergency use. It costs only about \$2
million to \$4 million for a set of diesel generators to produce 5
megawatts of electricity --- the amount the Army seeks --- and the
[diesel fuel would be **cheap** since]{.underline} the
[generators]{.underline} would operate [only during **rare**
emergencies]{.underline}.

By contrast, the [price of a single nuclear reactor]{.underline} to
produce the same five megawatts of electricity would be several hundred
million dollars --- roughly [**100** times as expensive]{.underline} ---
[according to government estimates]{.underline} and my previously
published research. Even if, as the Army hopes, the reactor could
replace the commercial grid as the primary source of power for the base,
the electricity produced by the reactor would cost several times more
than what the Army now pays for commercial electricity. So, regardless
of whether the reactor was used for primary or backup power, [Army costs
would **spike**]{.underline} substantially.

What about resilience, which is the supposed justification for buying
these expensive reactors? Well, even though reactors can produce
electricity, they have always required an external source of electricity
to keep them running safely --- most crucially to cool the fuel to avoid
a nuclear meltdown and radioactive release. The Army's recent request
for proposals seems to acknowledge this reality by saying that in
addition to an external electricity source, the reactor must have an
"alternative credited independent power source as a backup."

Therefore, an Army base reactor would almost surely depend on drawing
electricity from the commercial grid. But this means the reactor would
be no more resilient than the existing power source it is supposed to
replace to increase resilience. [In the event of a blackout]{.underline}
of the commercial grid, what would [the reactor]{.underline} do to get
essential electricity? Of course, it [would turn on its backup
**diesel** generators]{.underline}. However, if the base requires backup
generators anyway, it has [no need for the **super-expensive**
reactor]{.underline}.

It gets even worse. [To prevent **costs** from rising]{.underline} even
higher, [the nuclear industry]{.underline} has [decided]{.underline}
that its [small reactors]{.underline} --- the kind the Army is seeking
--- [will be built **without** a containment building that]{.underline}
could [**prevent** radiation from escaping]{.underline} in the event of
an accident. This also [means the reactors would be more **vulnerable**
to attack]{.underline} by aircraft, missiles, rockets, and drones.

A successful kinetic attack could spread radioactivity in at least two
ways. First, like a "dirty bomb," it could [disperse]{.underline} the
reactor's solid [irradiated fuel]{.underline} over a wide area into a
few [or]{.underline} many [**radioactive** chunks]{.underline} that
would be very hazardous if approached. Even worse, if the attack
interrupted the reactor's active or passive cooling, the fuel could
overheat and breach its cladding, thereby allowing gaseous radioactivity
to spread more widely.

Rationale #1: Casualty Reduction\
The [**main** rationale]{.underline} cited [to justify]{.underline} Army
**[mobile reactors]{.underline}** for FOBs [is to reduce **casualties**
from **convoys** that deliver **diesel** fuel for **generators** to
produce electricity]{.underline}, a risk typically illustrated by a
stock photograph (Figure 4). [The statistical evidence for
this]{.underline} rationale [is]{.underline} quite
**[old]{.underline}**, [dating to 2010]{.underline}, as cited in a 2015
RAND report: "From October 2001 to December 2010, of the approximately
36,000 total U.S. casualties in OIF \[Iraq\] and OEF \[Afghanistan\],
about 18,700 (52 percent) occurred from hostile attacks during land
transport missions."38 This outdated statistic is still cited in recent
government documents including the 2018 Army report, a 2018 Energy
Department report, and a 2021 Army presentation.39 However,
[the]{.underline} historical [claim cannot be **verified**]{.underline},
because it is based on a Pentagon study that is "not available to the
general public."40\
Figure 4. Diesel fuel convoy to forward operating base\
Source: Michael E. Canes, "Managing Military Energy for Greater Cost
Effectiveness," November 6, 2012.\
[**Contradictory** evidence]{.underline} is [provided in]{.underline} a
publicly available 2009 [Army study]{.underline} that [cites a **much
lower** casualty rate]{.underline} from convoys, as follows: "Resupply
casualties have been significant in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to
the Center for Army Lessons Learned, they have historically accounted
for about 10-12% of total Army casualties -- the majority related to
fuel and water transport."41\
Even if the 2010 statistic were accurate, it would not justify MNPPs for
several reasons. First, according to the Army, only about
**[half]{.underline}** of the cited land convoys were for fuel, while
the rest [were for **water**]{.underline} and other supplies.42 Second,
according to a 2009 GAO study of five FOBs in June 2008, an average of
[65 percent of]{.underline} the [diesel]{.underline} fuel delivered [was
not for]{.underline} electricity [generation]{.underline} but rather for
land vehicles and aircraft.43 This evidence suggests that only about 18
percent (.5 x .35) of the convoys comprised diesel for electricity
generation. Thus, even if the 2010 statistic were correct that 52
percent of casualties had been from convoys, and assuming no bias in the
distribution of convoy attacks or resulting casualties, only nine
percent (.18 x .52) of casualties during this period ending a decade ago
were attributable to convoys of diesel for electricity generation.
Moreover, [the share of]{.underline} delivered [diesel fuel]{.underline}
that is [used for electricity generation is]{.underline} even
**[small]{.underline}**er than 35 percent at big bases, which are the
main candidates for MNPPs. Thus, [mobile reactors]{.underline} at best
[could eliminate only a **small** fraction]{.underline} of the
casualties associated with a war base.\
The 2010 statistic is further misleading because during the past decade
the incidence of casualties per convoy has plummeted dramatically.
Figures 5 and 6 show that annual military deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq
dropped sharply from 2007 to 2019, even as fuel deliveries increased, so
the ratio of military deaths to delivered fuel decreased by 25fold. In
2005, there were 4.7 military deaths per million gallons of fuel used,
but nine years later this ratio had declined dramatically to 0.19,
despite similar amounts of fuel being used. This evidence indicates
that, by 2014, the [Pentagon had largely **solved**]{.underline} the
[problem]{.underline} of U.S. casualties [arising from fuel
convoys]{.underline}, apparently [through several
**innovations**]{.underline}: [better **roads**]{.underline}, an
improved relationship with Pakistan, [**outsourcing**
transport]{.underline} to non-U.S. personnel, [and use of
**airlift**]{.underline} where land routes were especially vulnerable.44
This finding is not an artifact of troop withdrawal because the largest
decrease in the casualty rate, from 2007 to 2009, occurred during an
increase in the number of deployed forces (Figure 7).\

Iraq\

It is not known why the Army, in its 2018 report, cited an outdated
casualty ratio that was 25 times higher than the reality at the time,
but this misleading statistic cannot be used to justify mobile nuclear
reactors. Even if convoys still were a large cause of U.S. troop
deaths[, it is **unlikely** that the most **efficient** way to
reduce]{.underline} such [casualties would be]{.underline} to develop,
manufacture, and deploy [**expensive** nuclear reactors that could
eliminate only a **fraction** of the]{.underline} 18 percent of
[convoys]{.underline} that carry diesel for electricity generation. As a
2016 scholarly article concluded, "Since water and waste trucks are
exposed to similar risks and subject to similar costs as fuel trucks ...
it is possible that [much **greater** benefits]{.underline} with much
less investment [can be achieved by targeting **water** and
**waste**]{.underline} logistics volumes instead of fuel."45

Despite the claims of developers, [it is **very unlikely**
that]{.underline} any reasonably foreseeable [SMR]{.underline} design
[would]{.underline} be able to [**safely** operate without]{.underline}
reliable [access to]{.underline} electricity from [the **grid** to power
coolant pumps and]{.underline} other [vital **safety**
systems]{.underline}. Just like today's nuclear plants, [SMRs will be
**vulnerable** to extreme **weather** events or other **disasters**
that]{.underline} could [cause a loss of **offsite** power and force
them to **shut down**]{.underline}. In such situations a user such as a
data center operator [would have to provide **backup**
power]{.underline}, likely [from **diesel** generators]{.underline}, for
both the data center AND the reactor. And since there is virtually no
experience with operating SMRs worldwide, it is highly doubtful that the
novel designs being pitched now would be highly reliable right out of
the box and require little monitoring and maintenance.

[It]{.underline} very likely [will take **decades**]{.underline} of
operating experience [for **any**]{.underline} new [reactor design to
achieve]{.underline} the level of [**[reliability]{.mark}**]{.underline}
characteristic [of the operating **light-water**]{.underline} reactor
[fleet]{.underline}. Premature deployment based on unrealistic
performance expectations could prove extremely costly for any company
that wants to experiment with SMRs.

**[Climate change]{.underline}** and its [**direct** and **indirect**
effects]{.underline}, including [on **politics** and
**security**]{.underline}, also [pose **risks** for nuclear power
plants]{.underline} and other critical infrastructure. Direct effects
include rapid-onset [extreme **weather** events]{.underline} (such as
**[storms]{.underline}** and storm surges, [heatwaves and flash
**floods**]{.underline}) [as well as]{.underline} slower-onset phenomena
(such as [**sea-level** rise]{.underline}, [**water**
scarcity]{.underline}, [changes to]{.underline} rainfall or average
**[temperatures]{.underline}**). All of this can
[**undermine**]{.underline} the safe and [secure **functioning** of
nuclear facilities]{.underline}. For instance,
**[drought]{.underline}**---especially compounded by competing demands
for water---could [disrupt the **cooling water** supply]{.underline} to
a reactor, potentially [necessitating a **shutdown**]{.underline}, while
[floods or storms could damage **critical** systems]{.underline}.\
A 2021 analysis of nuclear power plants' vulnerability to such
climate-linked effects is full of important insights. The [study
shows]{.underline} that the average frequency of [**climate-linked**
power outages]{.underline} at nuclear power plants globally has
[**dramatically** increased]{.underline}---from 0.2 outages per
reactor-year in the 1990s to about 0.82 in 2000s, to 1.5 in 2010--19. It
projects that [energy losses]{.underline} due to climate change [will
continue to rise]{.underline} among the world's nuclear power plants.\
That study's findings for the period 2010--19 suggest that, after
hurricanes and typhoons (in the United States, South and South East
Asia), the second largest climate-linked contributor to outages was
increased [ambient temperatures]{.underline}. Higher ambient
temperatures can affect nuclear power plants in a variety of ways. For
example, warmer temperatures [can foster the]{.underline} rapid [growth
of **algae** or other **biological** material]{.underline}, which can in
turn [**clog** cooling water intakes]{.underline}, [reducing
**production** and]{.underline} even [requiring]{.underline} the [plant
to **shut down**]{.underline}, particularly in warmer areas or reactors
using seawater for cooling. High ambient temperatures can also [make
power generation **less efficient**]{.underline}. Many of the developing
countries where electricity access is currently lowest (and thus where
SMRs might have the greatest value in promoting development) already
have relatively high ambient temperatures, which are likely to increase
further.

Few Suitable FOBs\
Even proponents of MNPPs concede that manufacturing the first one would
be expensive, but they argue that per-unit costs would decline sharply
as large numbers were ordered. In reality, however, there will be
[**few** if any FOBs that use **enough** electricity to]{.underline}
potentially [justify a MNPP]{.underline}, so it is unlikely that
economies of scale from mass production could be realized. The Pele
Program RFS specified the power output of MNPPs as ranging from 1 to 10
MWe, but as noted the maximum apparently was subsequently capped at 5
MWe. The cost per unit of power would likely decline with increasing
size, so **[low-power]{.underline}** MNPPs with output of 1 MWe [would
be **least** economical]{.underline}. If casualties from convoys of
diesel ever again became a problem, the lower power MNPPs also would do
less to address it, since they could eliminate fewer convoys. Therefore,
[the **strongest** possible case]{.underline} for MNPPs can be [made for
**larger**]{.underline} [ones]{.underline} with maximum output [of
either **5 or 10 MWe**]{.underline}. This raises a key question: How
many FOBs use so much electricity?\
Electricity demand and supply at a FOB typically correlate positively
with number of personnel, but not necessarily linearly. [Small FOBs
have]{.underline} few amenities and thus [**low** electricity
demand]{.underline} per capita. They also tend to be inefficient in
producing electricity, because they simultaneously run multiple
generators well below capacity in the absence of a microgrid. Larger
FOBs have a broader range of activities and amenities, and thus higher
electricity demand per capita. They also can produce electricity more
efficiently by operating prime generators at or near capacity for
distribution via a microgrid, although in practice they also operate
many smaller generators less efficiently. Usage of electricity also
varies within and between days, so that in the absence of energy storage
the production capacity must exceed not only the average usage but the
peak demand.\
Table 1. Energy Usage at Afghanistan FOBs: 2010 Per Capita Estimates\
Source: Michael Bowes and Barry Pifer, "Reducing Energy Footprint on the
Battlefield," CNA, CRM D0022638.A2/Final, June 2010, 17-19. Note: gpd =
gallons of diesel fuel per day (per capita).\
Previous research suggests that at large FOBs, the per capita
electricity demand is about 1 kW average and 2 kW peak, and the supply
capacity is larger. A 2010 study of Marine Corps FOBs in Afghanistan by
CNA (Table 1) found that such camps, which typically house at least
5,000 personnel, had average demand of 1.0 to 1.2 kW, which was supplied
by a capacity of 4 kW per person. Exemplifying this, in August 2009,
Camp Leatherneck in Afghanistan housed about 5,000 Marines and had an
average electricity demand of 5 MW, supplied by 196 generators with
total capacity of 19 MW,66 indicating that the electricity capacity was
about four times the average demand. Army test base studies suggest that
peak usage is typically about twice average usage,67 so Leatherneck's
peak usage may have been around 10 MW, or 2 kW per person.68\
Electricity supply capacity on FOBs often dwarfs both average and peak
demand due to inefficiencies, as at Camp Leatherneck in 2009, but the
Pentagon is working to fix that in two main ways. First, microgrids
allow electricity from any generator to be channeled to any end user, so
that supply capacity can be reduced to slightly above peak demand.
Second, energy storage allows electricity produced at times of low usage
to be utilized at times of high usage, so that supply capacity can be
reduced further to slightly above average demand. This suggests [a FOB
with **5,000** personnel could be **adequately** supplied]{.underline}
by 5 to 10 MWe of electricity generation, depending on the extent of the
microgrid and energy storage.\
[Assuming]{.underline} that Pele [MNPPs]{.underline} would be
**[most]{.underline}** cost [efficient]{.underline} if they produced
[at]{.underline} the **[maximum]{.underline}** [power]{.underline} level
(5 to 10 MWe), and that such output would suffice for 5,000 personnel,
it is necessary to explore [how many U.S. FOBs have]{.underline} at
least [that population]{.underline}. According to a RAND analysis, from
2012 to 2014, when the U.S. averaged 60,000 troops in Afghanistan, six
of its bases each exceeded 3,000 personnel on average, including
contractors.69 By extrapolation, a very rough estimate is that
[at]{.underline} the **[peak]{.underline}** of US
[deployment]{.underline} to Afghanistan and Iraq, in 2009, when slightly
over 200,000 troops were deployed, [about a **dozen**]{.underline} bases
contained 5,000 or more personnel and thus potentially could have been
suitable for the most economic utilization of one or more MNPPs.70
Today, by contrast, the number of such FOBs is zero, which would inhibit
the economic utilization of MNPPs. Prospectively, as well, [in light of
**diminished**]{.underline} U.S. public support for [large
deployments]{.underline} of forces, **[few]{.underline}** if any
cost-effective [opportunities]{.underline} for MNPPs on FOBs may arise
in the foreseeable future.\
The [Pentagon]{.underline} also is [**cutting** electricity
capacity]{.underline} needs on FOBs [through **efficiency**
reforms]{.underline} such as insulating barracks and equipping them with
thermostats, and adding microgrids and energy storage.71 The Army has
found such changes can [cut by **more than half** the **diesel** fuel
required]{.underline} for electricity at a large base in Afghanistan by
diminishing the demand for electricity and increasing the efficiency of
its production.72 Renewable energy, including solar and wind, can help
decrease the remaining demand for non-renewable sources.73 A U.S.
national laboratory also has explored connecting FOBs to the power grids
of their host countries,74 as is typical for other types of overseas
U.S. bases.75 [Such reforms]{.underline} will **[reduce]{.underline}**
further the [likelihood]{.underline} that a future [FOB would
**require** 5 to 10 MWe]{.underline} of power from a MNPP, as necessary
to optimize the reactor's economics. In light of this reality, the Army
in 2018 modified its rhetoric, claiming instead that [MNPPs]{.underline}
could be [deployed to large **rear** bases]{.underline} -- rather than
forward bases in war zones. However, this switch undermined the Army's
ostensible main rationale for expensive MNPPs: to reduce casualties from
delivering diesel fuel to FOBs. The rear bases that the Army identifies
as candidates for MNPPs are located in secure locations such as Alaska
and Puerto Rico,76 which face little risk of casualties from fuel
deliveries. Such bases [already have **secure** and affordable
electricity]{.underline} supply, typically either from the local power
grid or generators utilizing diesel fuel that can be delivered by
surface vessels without armed escort, thereby sharply reducing the fully
burdened cost of fuel and energy.77

While they share the overall focus on confronting what both Moscow and
Beijing see as a hostile and threatening U.S., [Russia and China have
**conflicting ends** when it comes to]{.underline} their [views on
their]{.underline} [respective roles in the]{.underline} future
[international system. [**Russia wants** to be a **leading great
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} but [[realize]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[role]{.mark} will [become increasingly difficult]{.mark}
if]{.underline} the [world moves towards a]{.underline} bipolar
[standoff between China and the U.S]{.underline}. Even if
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** officially adheres to multipolarity, it
[increasingly **[measures]{.mark}** and positions itself **[solely in
relation to]{.mark} the [U.S]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China thus assesses
its strategic cooperation with Russia in terms of the benefits this
cooperation brings in China's confrontation with the U.S.
[As]{.underline} the [power asymmetry continues to grow]{.underline} to
China's advantage, it is [highly likely]{.underline} that a more
confident **[Beijing]{.underline}** will [increasingly feel **entitled
to set the tone** in]{.underline} the strategic [partnership with
Russia]{.underline} and will push for emphasis on Chinese concepts and
ideas -- on the development of the future international order, for
example. We are [already seeing strong signs of this]{.underline}, most
recently [in the 2022 Joint Statement, in which Beijing expressed
support for]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n critique of NATO
enlargement for the first time. [When it came to describing]{.underline}
the preferred international [development]{.underline}, however, [Chinese
concepts and ideas]{.underline} were [clearly dominant]{.underline}
(President of Russia, 2022). [[To **leave**]{.mark} the **[dominant
role]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the initiative to China [does [**not
come easily** for Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, being [[**incompatible**
with]{.mark} Russian]{.underline} great power
[[identity]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Russian reservation shines through
in some of the formulations of its official statements:

The Russian side notes the significance of the concept of constructing a
"community of common destiny for mankind" proposed by the Chinese side
to ensure greater solidarity of the international community and
consolidation of efforts in responding to common challenges (President
of Russia, 2022).

According to Lukin (2021, p. 166), [Beijing's intensified effort to push
Chinese concepts and]{.underline} official [statements]{.underline} on
various issues and thus to shape the narrative of joint declarations and
treaties [provokes a **growing discontent**]{.underline} in Russia. As
seen in the 2022 Joint Statement, [Russia]{.underline} has [accepted
the]{.underline} Chinese concept of "community of common destiny" as
well as "the new era of [Sino-Russian relations]{.underline}" -- but
**[not without internal dissent]{.underline}** (see Denisov & Lukin,
2021, pp. 545--546). Such internal dissent in Russia is likely to grow
with the increase in Chinese confidence and assertiveness.

[[As China develops]{.mark} its goal of becoming]{.underline} a [world
class]{.underline} military [power]{.underline} and a maritime great
power, [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} deeply ingrained
[**[insecurity]{.mark}** and]{.underline} feeling of
**[[vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}** will also
[[grow]{.underline}]{.mark}. As demonstrated above, it will be
[particularly]{.underline} so [[in the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark},
given that Russia's great power identity is closely connected to the
region. [Moscow]{.underline} will therefore [find it extremely difficult
to make room for]{.underline} and to accommodate [China as
the]{.underline} leading [great power there. In other
words]{.underline}: while [Russia and China have expanded their
strategic cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline} in recent years, [there
are [**serious stumbling blocks** to]{.mark} further
[expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.mark} wants to **[retain]{.mark}** its
**[position]{.mark}**]{.underline} as the leading power **[[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to preserve the privileges of the
Arctic states in relation to Arctic governance. Such [ends]{.underline}
will [[increasingly]{.mark} be [challenged by]{.mark} a more
**[assertive China]{.mark}**]{.underline} insisting on being respected
and included in the region as a great power, and on gaining a decisive
role and influence on the region's governance regime. As mentioned
above, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} [shows a preference for
non-Arctic]{.underline} specific [[agreements and
regulations]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [until now]{.underline} has been
[[met with **strong resistance** in Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here it
is worth noting the statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry's Special
Envoy to the Arctic, Nikolay Korchunov that

it is impossible to disagree with U.S. Secretary of State Michael
Pompeo's statement made in May 2019 that there are two groups of
countries --- Arctic and non-Arctic ... He said so in relation to China,
which positioned itself as a near-Arctic state. We disagree with this
(quoted in Wishnick, 2021)

In this one sentence, Korchunov says that [[China, in Russia's
view]{.mark}, is [**not** an Arctic state]{.mark}]{.underline} and
therefore [should [not]{.mark} [enjoy]{.mark}]{.underline} comparable
[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}. Arctic [governance]{.underline}, in other
words, [is for Arctic states]{.underline}. It should be
[remembered]{.underline} that [**[Russia]{.mark}** initially **[opposed
China's]{.mark}** observer **[status]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
Arctic Council [until China agreed to recognize]{.underline} the
privileges and rights of the [Arctic states]{.underline} (Wishnick,
2020, p. 6). However, Beijing has since gradually moved and is
increasingly challenging Russia's -- and the other Arctic states' --
position in line with its overall ambition of becoming "rule-maker"
instead of "rule-taker". Increasing [[Chinese]{.mark} lawfare
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially, are [[to meet **strong
resistance** in Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Given these vulnerabilities, [**sophisticated**
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} seeking to [hinder U.S.
forces]{.underline} are likely to [[realize]{.mark} the [**utility**
of]{.mark} the [reactor]{.mark}]{.underline} as an area-denial target.
In comparison to typical area-denial tactics that require constant use
of munitions and can only continue as long as those munitions last, a
[[reactor strike]{.mark} offers [**months** of
exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline} at the cost of only a few
[well-placed]{.underline} high-explosive [warheads]{.underline}, a
[[capability **well within reach**]{.underline}]{.mark} of even regional
adversaries, as demonstrated by Iran's attack on Al Asad air base. While
these reactors are not intended to be [deployed on]{.underline} the
[**front lines** of a conflict]{.underline}, and would reside in
well-guarded revetments, a [[**major** aspect of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[rationale]{.underline}]{.mark} for [placing]{.underline} these
[reactors at **forward operating**]{.underline} bases is their
[[proximity to conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} and the [[likelihood of
attacks on]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[supply
lines]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Likewise, the requirements laid out in
Pele make it clear that these [reactors will [not]{.mark}]{.underline}
be [[buried or encased in concrete]{.underline}]{.mark}, as they are
intended to be **[rapidly mobile]{.underline}**. The [[consequences
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a reactor [[strike are
serious]{.underline}]{.mark} and deployment of these systems requires
both detailed understanding and extensive preparation for the
radiological consequences of a strike.

[Even assuming]{.underline} that the [fuel material does not
leak]{.underline} fission products under the thermal and mechanical
shock of an attack, **[[direct irradiation]{.underline}]{.mark}** from
reactor [fuel fragments]{.underline} will [[pose a
hazard]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[cannot be
mitigated]{.underline}]{.mark}** by defense equipment for
**[chemical]{.underline}**, **[biological]{.underline}**,
**[radiological]{.underline}**, **[nuclear]{.underline}**, and high
yield **[explosives]{.underline}**. The gamma dose rate at 50cm from a
pea-size tri-structural isotropic fuel fragment with burnup similar to
what would be anticipated at the end of a fuel cycle would impart
a near-fatal dose in under an hour. Such
[[fragments]{.underline}]{.mark} could [**easily** settle]{.underline}
on or [[lodge in equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}, as seen in the
[[cleanup]{.underline}]{.mark} effort following Chernobyl, [rendering it
**[useless]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is conceivable that the exclusion
area resulting from a [successful reactor strike]{.underline} could
force large sections of a [[base]{.underline}]{.mark} to be
[[evacuated]{.underline}]{.mark} for weeks or months [[due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the external [[radiation]{.underline}]{.mark}
exposure threat alone.

An [[attack]{.mark} against]{.underline} a mobile [nuclear
reactor]{.underline} resulting in the release of fission products could
[[pose]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[contamination
**hazard**]{.underline}]{.mark} that would [render **material
useless**]{.underline}, even if fuel fragments are successfully located
and removed. Should 1 percent of the fuel particles be [damaged in a
kinetic attack]{.underline}, tens of kilocuries of volatile [fission
products]{.underline} would be [released]{.underline}. Many of these
radioisotopes would react with air, water, and soil to create mobile
[[**radioactive** contamination]{.underline}]{.mark} that would require
topsoil removal; disposal of equipment; and extensive, dose-intensive
decontamination using caustic agents and media-blasting. As a point of
comparison, decontamination of aircraft used in the response at
Chernobyl proved so costly that dozens of military helicopters were
decommissioned and left to rust at the accident site even as the Soviet
Union pursued a campaign in Afghanistan that was heavily reliant on
those aircraft.

[[Even]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or minimally [damaging [attack]{.mark}]{.underline} on a reactor could
[[offer]{.underline}]{.mark} an [adversary **[significant
benefits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Due to the risk of radiological
release, moderate damage incurred by a reactor installation through a
small attack would lead to a significantly extended shelter-in-place
order to evaluate consequences in comparison to an attack on a
conventional power system. This effect may be used synergistically,
allowing the adversary to concentrate or [[**distract**
personnel]{.underline}]{.mark} for an [[extended
time]{.underline}]{.mark}, potentially [[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[**effectiveness** of other attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
offers the adversary a significantly [greater ability to [**degrade**
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}, hold personnel at risk, [[and decrease
**morale**]{.underline}]{.mark} with [minimal expenditure]{.underline}:
A strategy that may be especially attractive to adversaries incapable of
destroying the reactor outright.

Yet because **[[airpower]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as a subset of war, [is
not only]{.underline} **[a political instrument]{.underline}** [but also
one that is **applied by humans**]{.underline}, [it [will be subject
to]{.mark} the whims and [frailties of the **political
leader**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[who chooses to rely on
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Richard Nixon saw himself as a Patton-esque
figure who could swiftly and efficiently brandish military force to
achieve his aims. He felt little compunction in berating his air
commanders or---in the case of General Lavelle---casting one adrift when
he thought that doing so might save him embarrassment. Nixon believed
that airpower gave him the ideal military tool for threatening an
opponent or persuading an ally, and that perspective has gained traction
since he left the White House. [The last four occupants of the Oval
Office]{.underline}, to include President Barack Obama, [have all relied
heavily on airpower in the conflicts they have fought]{.underline}. [The
[positive goals]{.mark} pursued]{.underline}--- [["stability,"]{.mark}
"security," [and]{.mark}, on occasion, "[democracy"---have proved
**difficult to achieve with**]{.mark}]{.underline} any military force,
particularly with [**[airpower]{.underline}**. [Its **siren song**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [an **[enticing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [one,
however, as Johns Hopkins Professor Eliot Cohen has astutely
observed]{.underline}, "**[[Airpower is]{.mark} an unusually
[seductive]{.mark} form of military strength]{.underline}**, [in part
because]{.underline}, [[like **modern courtship**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[it appears to offer **gratification without
commitment**]{.underline}]{.mark}."48 [[That promise is]{.mark} a
**[dangerous]{.mark} one**]{.underline}, [as General Myers
warns:]{.underline}

> [[The last thing that we want is for]{.mark} the **political
> [leadership]{.mark}** [to **think war is too
> easy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially in terms of
> **casualties**]{.underline}. It's awful; it's horrible, but sometimes

Were he alive today, the Prussian military philosopher Carl von
Clausewitz would doubtless nod in agreement at General Myers's
observation.

But **[[Clausewitz]{.underline}]{.mark}** [never saw an
airplane]{.underline}; [if he had, though, his airpower notions would
likely have been **unsurprising**]{.underline}. Had he examined
America's air wars in Vietnam, [he [would]{.mark} certainly [have
commented about]{.mark} the **[difficulty of achieving political
objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in a limited war]{.underline}. In all
probability, he would have looked at President Johnson's Tuesday

Thanks, Peter, I think [[the]{.mark} overarching [thing
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, sort of, **[[sticks out for
me]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and I would say this [[as an **airpower
specialist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but [[about the **western way of
war** is an **unhealthy**]{.mark}, frankly, **[dependency on
airpower]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In effect, [the]{.underline}, sort of,
[success of]{.underline}, basically [the US Air Force and the coalition
in clearing the skies and then really smashing the Iraqi forces in 1991
has]{.underline}, kind of, [led to]{.underline}, in conjunction with [a
series of relatively **discretionary conflicts**]{.underline} [where
[there was a desire to keep **footprints to a minimum on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [a tendency to
**design**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[maritime and land
components]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of the joint force [around an
assumption of **huge amounts of**]{.mark} **firepower and [overhead
ISTAR]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on tap]{.underline}. And **[this idea that
you\'re always going to have air superiority]{.underline}**, it\'s the
prerequisite you often hear, they\'re, kind of, cliched but things like,
well, air superiority is like oxygen, when you have it you don\'t think
about it, when you don\'t have it you can\'t think of anything else. But
[it really is **striking**]{.underline}, [when you look at the **western
military\'s standfast**]{.underline}, to a degree the US, just by dint
of scale, but particularly the European NATO members, of course I
include the UK in that. That, [[compared to a force like
**Russia**]{.underline} **[or]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or indeed more allied forces in the
Pacific theatre like South Korea, for example, that [[we have,
really]{.mark}, **very, [very limited ground and maritime-based
firepower]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[There is this **huge
dependency on**]{.mark} **the [air]{.mark} side**]{.underline}, [[which
becomes **very**]{.mark}**, very [problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if you then need to **plan to or**]{.mark}**, indeed, god forbid,
[actually fight]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[an **opponent**]{.mark} who can
make that air superiority very **difficult to achieve.**]{.underline}

#### Air power doesn't change [overall]{.underline} balance of power.

Dr. Jeremy **Black 16**, PhD from Durham University, Professor and
Established Chair in History at Exeter University, "Air Power: Strength
and Weaknesses",
https://defenceindepth.co/2016/05/11/air-power-strength-and-weaknesses/

These issues raise questions not only about how best to present the
history of air power, but also concerning its past and continuing
rationale and relevance. [[Air power]{.mark},]{.underline} especially if
missiles are included, [[has always appealed to those]{.mark} who are
**[looking for "the modern,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}
**["latest and the greatest,"]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and for a
strategic **"magic bullet."**]{.underline} However, [the
[accounts]{.mark} of contemporaries [about
**effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the hopes of the advocates
[of air power, have frequently proved
**misplaced**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and often seriously so. [This is the
case both for the **military outcomes** of its use and for their
**political consequences.**]{.underline}

Nevertheless, despite the problems confronted in adapting circumstances,
learning lessons, coping with the pressures of commitments, and
responding to fiscal exigencies, air power has dramatically changed
equations for firepower and mobility. More specifically, both in its own
right, and as part of combined air operations, air power has made
manoeuvre warfare a more central part of conflict. As a result, air
power has greatly increased the tempo of war as well as its potential
deadliness.

As with armoured warfare when it was introduced in the 1910s, the
perception of the capability of air power and its reality were very
different. This was also true for fears of what it might mean for
warfare. [There is generally a **poor understanding** of the
**reliability** of aircraft systems]{.underline}. In practice, [the more
complex a system, the less reliable it is.]{.underline} [And there is
the issue of appropriate use]{.underline}. Thus, [[air power is **not a
panacea**]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, in one particular respect, air
power fulfilled the hopes of some early advocates. Thanks to the
successful integration of reconnaissance information with artillery,
aircraft helped overcome the relative stasis of First World War land
operations. In doing so, aircraft helped restore mobility and, at least,
a sense of results to ground operations, although this achievement was
heavily qualified in terms of outcomes. In the 1918 Allied victory on
the Western Front, more was due to the effective use of artillery
incorporating the advantages of air-derived information than to new
weapons, whether tanks or aircraft, operating in ground support roles,
let alone to long-range bombing. Nevertheless, air power indeed proved
part of the equation in translating advantages into the ability to
defeat opposing forces on the ground, as it also did in 1918 with the
British success against the Turks in Palestine.

This factor remained important in the understanding, presentation and
use of air power. All of the combatants in the Second World War believed
in the value of air dominance or supremacy and in its impact on
operations on the ground, even if not all pursued the latter with the
immediacy understood by the term ground support. Indeed, the stress on
the war-winning dimension of air power encouraged Britain and the United
States, neither of which saw their army as war-winning, to focus not on
ground support but on gaining an air dominance that could be used for
strategic bombing campaigns against their opponents' home countries,
rather than, at least as primarily intended, to affect operations on the
ground. However, the latter was also an objective, even if the
relationship between strategic bombing and theatre dominance was
frequently somewhat unclear in practice.

These goals and priorities were not static. They were affected by
resources, opportunities, doctrine and the ability to respond. Thus, the
American ability to demonstrate flexibility and rethink the situation,
and to plan and produce accordingly, led to the development and use of a
long-range escort fighter capability. Similarly, in large part in
response to Japanese advances in China and Japanese advances in the
Pacific, the Americans moved their focus for air attacks on Japan from
China-based aircraft to those operating from Pacific bases, and this had
significant strategic and operational consequences. Ground-support
proved more significant from the outset for militaries that were reliant
on their armies for war-winning, rather than on strategic bombing. This
was the case in the Second World War for Germany, Japan, the Soviet
Union and China.

The demonstration of air power in the 1940s challenged the traditional
geopolitical dichotomy of land and sea. Contemporaries, such as Carl
Schmidt in Land and Sea (1942), argued that this would revolutionize
geopolitics. The range and tempo of geopolitical rivalry was certainly
different. During the Cold War, contrasting national legacies,
priorities and opportunities very much affected the protagonists. The
United States and Britain continued to place an emphasis on strategic
bombing, one greatly enhanced by the availability of nuclear weapons. In
contrast, although the Soviet Union had effective long-range bombers, as
it had not done during the Second World War, the stress there was on
ground-support.

[As of the present, [air power has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[confirmed]{.underline}**, **[not challenged]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[the [overall]{.mark} ranking of [military
strength]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if [[it]{.underline} **[has not
enabled]{.underline}** [that strength to **operate** as
**effectively**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[as had been
proclaimed]{.underline}** [and as might have been
**anticipated**]{.underline}. At the higher level, [[air
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, like space power, [has greatly
changed]{.underline} global-[reach capabilities]{.underline}, **[but
[has not changed the way the global system operates]{.mark}
politically]{.underline}** [[nor]{.underline} **[radically
altered]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[the concentration of [military
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Britain and the United States,
successively, the leaders in sea power, became (so far), successively,
the leading air powers (especially, as it should be, if naval air power
is also part of the equation); albeit their being subject to short-term
intense challenges as well as to more lasting questions about their
successive effectiveness as the leading state and about the
effectiveness of air power. These leading powers have been technological
leaders and, like other states with cutting-edge technology, have tended
to rely, at least in part, on air power as a function of their economic
and technological advantages, whether or not the results have encouraged
the process. Moreover, the arrival, and, even more, diffusion, of new
technologies suggested that air power in the shape of unmanned aircraft
has a great potential. Air power therefore very much continues to be
part of the military agenda.

Peter Roberts: So, this places us in quite a difficult position because,
[having defined [the]{.mark} western [way of war as so **dependent on
air power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **close air support** and air
supremacy, from what you\'re saying, **that\'s just not going to

Justin Bronk: **[[Against a very highest end

think it\'s going to work**]{.mark} in its current form]{.underline}.
[There\'s various ways that air forces can try and make that picture a
bit better]{.underline}, you know, things [like practising dispersal for
their assets so that they can actually sustain with lower risk of being
destroyed]{.underline} on the ground a more prolonged air campaign
[and]{.underline}, at least, are for a threat in being, [investing in
more long-range standoff munitions]{.underline} capability. They\'re
expensive but the more targets you can service, the more rapidly, the
faster you might be able to get some close air support in.

**Inertia, debt, and underfunding thump air power.**

**Zuegel '20** \[Keith; Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, served in combat

After more than 20 years of advocating for the U.S. Air Force, I
continue to be surprised how [the world's most dominant air force has
been **taken for granted**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} even
**[ignored]{.underline}**, in Washington, D.C. [[Congress remains
**fixated on shipbuilding**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} the
[ground services **dominate**]{.mark} the military's **senior
positions**]{.underline}, **[policy]{.underline}** [and **defense
[budgets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Department of [the Air
Force]{.mark}]{.underline}, responsible for training and equipping two
military services --- the Air Force and the Space Force --- [[has been
**underfunded for decades**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [resulting in
significant **shortfalls in readiness** and
**modernization**]{.underline}. While the Air Force forfeited future
modernization to pay for current operations, China and Russia made great
strides toward parity. Politicians protect airplanes on military
installations to prevent closures, so [the U.S. Air Force has been
**unable to right-size its basing** and has been **stonewalled** in
managing its force structure.]{.underline} For the past couple years,
the Air Force requested funding to grow its force by 23 percent to 386
squadrons. [Congress]{.underline} authorized it --- but [fails to
provide the commensurate funding. Air Force leaders have long insisted
that the service needs [investment]{.mark}; however, their [requests
go]{.mark} largely **[ignored]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The force has
grown]{.underline} too **[old]{.underline}**, too
**[small]{.underline}** [and **not ready** to meet future global
threat]{.underline}s. Meanwhile, [[China and Russia]{.mark} **increased
investments in technology** and [are **leaping ahead**]{.mark} in
capabilities such as **hypersonics**]{.underline}. The U.S. Air Force is
continually forced to choose: Win today's fight, or modernize for
tomorrow's conflict. To fund newer aircraft, it must divest
resource-draining legacy aircraft --- designed for past conflicts and
unable to penetrate modern defenses. Yet, [[Congress]{.mark} continues
to [**force** the service to keep **dated aircraft**]{.mark}, or even
procure **more old fighters**.]{.underline} After 1991′s Operation
Desert Storm, [[the]{.underline} [Air Force was **downsized by a
third**]{.underline}]{.mark}[. It is now **too small** for our nation's
requirements]{.underline}. Of all the services deployed to the Persian
Gulf in 1990, however, only the Air Force has yet to return --- 30 years
of continuous combat operations. [The need for modernization grows
**more dire each year.** The Minuteman intercontinental ballistic
missile force is now **beyond repair**]{.underline} and must be
replaced. [**[Ninety percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Air Force [bombers]{.mark} [**predate** stealth techn]{.mark}ology [and
are **unable** to penetrate]{.mark} modern air
[defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Defense Department's budget is
**confusing**]{.underline} --- [and **misleading**]{.underline}. On the
surface, it appears that the departments of the Air Force, Army and Navy
receive comparable shares of the budget. That's false. There is a
little-understood provision, referred to as the "pass-through," which
quietly transfers more than 20 percent of the Department of the Air
Force's budget to programs outside its control. Pass-through funds that
seemed to go to the Air Force for space were inaccessible for Air Force
space investment. Meanwhile, [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 has
**[[exacerbated readiness challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the
military. [**Four [huge stimulus]{.mark} funding [bills]{.mark}** [will

[Here's a fact that ought to **startle** every American who assumes that

**primacy over our emerging rival**, China.]{.underline}

"Over the past decade, [[in]{.mark} U.S. [war games against China, the

a]{.mark} **nearly [perfect record]{.mark}**[: We have
**lost**]{.mark}]{.underline} almost **[[every single
time]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

That's a quote from a new book called "The Kill Chain: Defending America
in the Future of High-Tech Warfare," the most provocative critique of
U.S. defense policy I've read in years. It's written by Christian Brose,
former staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a close
adviser to late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). [The book isn't just a
wake-up call, it's a **fire alarm** in the night.]{.underline}

Brose explains a terrible truth about war with China: [[Our]{.mark} spy
and communications [satellites would **immediately**
be]{.mark}]{.underline} \[**[[shut down]{.underline}]{.mark}**\]
~~disabled~~; [[our]{.underline}]{.mark} forward
**[[bases]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Guam and Japan [[would be
"**inundated**"]{.mark} by **precise missiles**]{.underline}; [our
[aircraft carriers would have to **sail away**]{.mark}]{.underline} from
China to escape attack; [[our]{.mark} F-35 [fighter jets **couldn't
reach their targets** because]{.mark} the **[refueling tankers]{.mark}**
they need [would be **shot down**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Many U.S. forces would be rendered \[ignorant\] ~~deaf, dumb and
blind~~," writes Brose. We have become so vulnerable, he argues because
we've lost sight of the essential requirement of military power --- the
"kill chain" of his title --- which means seeing threats and taking
quick, decisive action to stop them.

[How did this happen? [It **wasn't**]{.mark} an **intelligence
failure**]{.underline}, or a malign Pentagon and Congress, [or [**lack
of money**, or **insufficient tech**]{.mark}**nological

### Airpower Bad\-\--1NC

#### Overreliance on air power is [bad]{.underline}\-\--it [trades off]{.underline} with land power, undermines [state stability]{.underline}, causes [terrorism]{.underline}, and [weakens deterrence]{.underline}.

Dr. Steven **Metz 16**, PhD in Political Science from Johns Hopkins
University, Senior Research Professor and the Henry L. Stimson Professor
of Military Studies at the U.S. Army War College Strategic Studies
Institute, "For U.S., Ignoring the Limitations of Airpower a Recipe for
Disaster",
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/for-u-s-ignoring-the-limitations-of-airpower-a-recipe-for-disaster/?one-time-read-code=35983166440707848432

There are good reasons for this. [[Relying on airpower]{.underline},
**[rather than direct methods]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that put U.S.
troops in close proximity to enemies]{.underline}, [lowers American
casualties]{.underline}. [Airpower exploits America's technological
superiority]{.underline}. [And it's]{.underline}
\[[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[easier to disengage]{.mark}, should
things go badly]{.underline}, if the United States does not have troops
on the ground. Aircraft can fly away from a losing cause without seeming
to retreat or surrender.

Because of this, [airpower has long been a **foundation** of American
military power]{.underline}. **[[The problem,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[though, [is that U.S. airpower is so **good**]{.mark} **at what it
does** accomplish [that policymakers]{.mark} and the public [can **lose
sight of its limitations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Too often Americans
expect **more** than airpower can **deliver**]{.underline}, [[using it
to seek]{.mark} the sort of [decisive results that only come from a
**direct** ]{.mark}**application of [force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The
result is]{.mark} endless **frustration**]{.underline}, [which in turn
**fuels [calls for U.S. disengagement from the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To avoid this vicious cycle, American
military leaders, policymakers, political leaders and opinion-shapers
must be clear on what airpower can and can't do.

For instance, airpower is very good at denying an opponent that relies
on conventional military force a decisive victory. No conventional
military---or even a semi-conventional one, like the self-declared
Islamic State force that captured Mosul and other Iraqi cities last
year---can withstand the precise and withering fire delivered by
American airpower. This makes it a powerful and vital deterrent of
conventional aggression and component of containment. Airpower can
salvage an unraveling situation when a partner is collapsing under
military pressure. And airpower can even things up when the United
States is backing an irregular force against a conventional military,
such as Afghanistan's Northern Alliance in its war with the Taliban
after the attacks of 9/11.

[What [airpower **can't**]{.mark} **do**]{.underline}, though, [is
[defeat an **irregular opponent**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the absence
of an **effective ground force**]{.underline}, whether American, local
or some combination of the two. This is because, [in the face of intense
air attacks]{.underline}, [[an irregular force can
**disperse**]{.underline}, **[go to ground]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[wait out the storm]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [then
**reconstitute** and **resume operations**]{.underline}. [Nor can air
attacks be sustained at a "shock and awe" level for a protracted length
of time without **incurring serious risks**]{.underline}, as airmen grow
fatigued and equipment wears out. [And [airpower **cannot control
territory or populations**]{.mark}]{.underline} on its own,
[[or]{.underline} **[stabilize a post-conflict state]{.underline}** [to
pave the way for **long-term stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [American
[airpower is masterful at **destroying**]{.mark} **targets** and enemy
forces, but [not]{.mark} at **[shaping the political outcome of a
war.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

To put this in today's context, airpower can prevent the Islamic State
from taking more Iraqi cities. It can deter outright, large-scale
military aggression by China, Russia, Iran or North Korea. But it cannot
defeat the Islamic State, stabilize North Korea after a war, or prevent
the kind of camouflaged aggression below the threshold for war that
Russia has used against its neighbors and China is using to seize
control of the South China Sea.

But are these latter missions vital to U.S. national security, or even
important? The United States could alter its global strategy to one
based exclusively on indirect military power, including seapower,
Special Operations Forces activities, and airpower. As Mike Pietrucha
and Jeremy Renken [put
it](http://warontherocks.com/2015/08/airpower-may-not-win-wars-but-it-sure-doesnt-lose-them/),
"not all conflicts have to be resolved by the seizure of land, and not
all political solutions require armed occupations to enforce."

But some do.

**[[The sort of airpower-centric strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [which
Pietrucha and Renken recommend]{.underline} would [only work
if]{.underline} the expectations of the American people are brought in
line with what indirect power can actually achieve. If [the United
States is willing to rely on strategic spoiling attacks to prevent
conventional]{.underline} or semi-conventional [enemies from winning a
decisive victory]{.underline}---that is, if it is willing to contain
them rather than defeat them---and if it is willing to deter
conventional or semi-conventional aggression without actually exercising
control over any other part of the world, then relying on indirect
military power would be enough.

[An argument can be made that this would]{.underline}, in fact, [be the
best American global strategy, as it would **avoid
entanglement**]{.underline} [in complex and often bloody conflicts on
the part of people who often don't really want the United States there
in the first place]{.underline}. [It [would]{.mark}, though, [require
a]{.mark}]{.underline} fundamental **[shift in the]{.underline}**
American **[way of thinking]{.underline}** [about the

[Today the United States is the only nation that has the **military

question for Americans is whether this is a capability worth keeping.

Some day there may be a third way between the direct and indirect
application of American military power based on the deployment of
autonomous or remotely controlled platforms that can exercise some
degree of local control without putting large numbers of American troops
in danger. Until then, [**[expecting too much of airpower]{.underline}**
[is a recipe for **disaster**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Political leaders

realistic.

#### Failed states go [nuclear]{.underline}\-\--[extinction]{.underline}.

The disregard for nuclear commitments and an increasing nuclear
stockpile reflect growing global passivity. With the current nuclear
stockpile standing at around 13000, Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI) has projected a considerable growth in the
number of nuclear bombs in the years to come. In his assessment, UK
security adviser Stephen Lovegrove said the nuclear threat is higher
today than it was during the cold war, warning that a breakdown of
dialogue among the rival powers could trigger a nuclear war in Eurasia.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Putin's warning of a nuclear attack on
NATO has put the world in imminent danger. The ongoing escalation in the
Taiwan Strait is fraught with risks of nuclear misadventures.
**[Multiple [powder kegs]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[exist today with
**nuclear weapons on**]{.mark} **standby**]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
**[[hair triggers.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Pakistan-India, US-China,
US-Russia-NATO, Iran-Israel-US, North Korea-South Korea-US are potential
nuclear flashpoints today. **[[A minor mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[misconception]{.underline}**, [or a **technical glitch**]{.underline}
[[is enough to ignite]{.mark} the **cascade of a [nuclear
inferno.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Moreover, the growth of [**[rogue states, failed states and non-state
actors]{.underline}** [adds to the **nuclear
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The unchecked [prolif]{.mark}eration
[of nuclear]{.mark}-grade **[fissile material]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[nuclear ambitions]{.mark}** of a

[non-proliferation]{.underline} and arms control [desperately
failed]{.underline}. Interests and [biased stances of major world
powers]{.underline}, the US being in the forefront, [weakened the
international nuclear control regimes]{.underline}.

Though the assertions of the proponents of nuclear weapons as a source
of stability might be grounded in logic or custom, we should not forget
that [[the environment for nuclear wars thrives in
**anarchy**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [a realm **far beyond** the
international]{.underline} cannons and [conventions of
warfare]{.underline}. As the times have been fast-changing, so do the
context, composition and behaviour of the international actors. [In

[where fundamental human rights face serious blows, [even in]{.mark} the

Sub-national or Terrorist Threats

Strategic policies will have to deal with a variegated assortment of
sub-national threats of WMD terrorism. Until now, insurgent enemies were
sometimes able to confront states with serious perils and in assorted
theatres of conflict, but they were never really capable of posing any
catastrophic hazard to a nation's homeland. Now, however, [[with]{.mark}
the [**steadily expanding** prospect of **WMD**]{.mark}**-equipped**
[terrorist enemies]{.mark} -- possibly, in the future, **[even]{.mark}**
well-armed **[nuclear]{.mark}** terrorists-- humankind could have to
face a strategic situation that is]{.underline} prospectively
**[dire]{.underline}** and historically sui generis.

To face any such unprecedented and portentous situation,
**[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s president
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} need to [["arm"]{.mark} themselves
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} antecedent [[**nuclear** doctrine]{.mark} and
policies]{.underline}. By definition, such doctrine and policies should
never represent "seat of the pants" reactions to ad hoc threats. Rather,
because generality is a trait of all serious meaning in science, such
doctrine and policies will have to be shaped according to broad
categories of strategic threat. In the absence of such previously
worked-out conceptual categories, human responses are almost certain to
be inadequate or worse.

Rationality and Non-Rationality

From the start, all strategic policies have been founded upon some
underlying assumption of rationality. We humans have always presumed
that our enemies, states and terrorists, will inevitably value their own
continued survival more highly than any other preference or combination
of preferences. But this core assumption can no longer be taken for
granted.

Expressions of decisional irrationality could take various different and
overlapping forms. These forms include a disorderly or inconsistent
value system; computational errors in calculation; an incapacity to
communicate efficiently; random or haphazard influences in the making or
transmittal of particular decisions; and the internal dissonance
generated by any structure of collective decision-making (i.e.,
assemblies of individuals who lack identical value systems and/or whose
organizational arrangements impact their willing capacity to act as a
single or unitary national decision maker).

Confronted with Jihadist enemies, states and terrorists, world leaders
must quickly understand that our primary threats to retaliate for
first-strike aggressions could sometime fall on deaf ears. This holds
true whether we would threaten massive retaliation (MAD), or instead,
the more graduated and measured forms of reprisal termed nuclear
utilization theory (NUT).

Ultimately, sensible. nuclear doctrine must recognize certain critical
connections between law and strategy. From the formal standpoint of
international law, certain expressions of preemption or defensive first
strikes are known as anticipatory self-defense. Expecting possible enemy
irrationality, when would such protective military actions be required
to safeguard the human homeland from diverse forms of WMD attack?

This is an all-important question to be considered.

There is more. Recalling that international law is part of the law of
the United States, most notably at Article 6 of the Constitution (the
"Supremacy Clause") and at a 1900 Supreme Court case (the Pacquete
Habana), how could anticipatory military defense actions be rendered
compatible with both conventional and customary obligations? This is a
critical question to be raised.

From the standpoint of international law, it is necessary to distinguish
preemptive attacks from "preventive ones." Preemption is a military
strategy of striking first in the expectation that the only foreseeable
alternative would be to be struck first oneself. A preemptive attack is
launched by a state that believes enemy forces are about to attack. A
preventive attack, on the other hand, is not launched out of any genuine
concern about "imminent" hostilities, but rather for fear of some
longer-term deterioration in a prevailing military balance.

In a preemptive attack, the length of time by which the enemy's action
is anticipated is presumptively very short; in a preventive strike, the
anticipated interval is considerably longer. A related problem here for
the United States and allies is not only the practical difficulty of
accurately determining "imminence," but also the problems of
postponement. To the point, delaying a defensive strike until an
imminent threat would be tangibly ascertainable could invite existential
harms. [[A]{.mark} state's [resort to]{.mark} "anticipatory
[self-defense" could be **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} or non-nuclear,
and be directed at either a nuclear or non-nuclear adversary.

[[Any]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[resort]{.mark} involving nuclear
weapons [on **one** or **several sides**]{.mark} could [prove
**catastrophic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nuclear Targeting Issues

There is more. World leaders must understand that any proposed national
strategic doctrine will need to consider and reconsider key issues of
nuclear targeting. Relevant operational concerns here would concern
vital differences between the targeting of enemy civilians and cities
(so-called "counter value" targeting) and targeting of enemy military
assets/infrastructures (so-called "counterforce" targeting). Most
national leaders still don't realize that the actual essence of "massive
retaliation" and MAD was always an unhidden plan for counter value
targeting.

At first glance, any such partially-resurrected doctrine could sound
barbarous or at least inhumane, but if the alternative were less
credible systems of nuclear deterrence, certain explicit codifications
of counter value posture might still become the best way to prevent
millions of civilian deaths -- i.e., deaths from nuclear war and/or
nuclear terrorism. Neither preemption nor counter value targeting could
ever guarantee absolute security for Planet Earth, but it is nonetheless
imperative that we put serious strategic thinkers to work on these and
other critically-related nuclear warfare issues. Under no circumstances
should these policies ever be fashioned by "trained specialists" in
marketing and public relations.

Quo Vadis

The first time that a world leader will have to face an authentic
nuclear crisis, his or her national response should flow seamlessly from
broad and previously calibrated strategic doctrine. It follows that
national leaders should already be thinking carefully about how this
complex doctrine could best be shaped and articulated. Whatever the
particulars, these leaders should acknowledge at the outset the broadly
systemic nature of the global security problem.

There is one final summarizing aspect of nuclear war avoidance. This is
the continuously-intersecting subject matter of law. Whatever strategic
imperatives can be identified, national leaders with nuclear weapons
access or authority must be continuously constrained by binding
principles of international law. These compelling principles concern all
elements of the law of armed conflict or humanitarian international law,
and various peremptory anti-genocide norms of the international law of
human rights. At the same time, treaty law among sovereign states will
never be suitably self-enforcing, and expectations of pacta sunt
servanda will likely still fall upon largely deaf ears.

Going forward, a planetary system of law and power management that seeks
to avoid nuclear war must recognize another significantly underlying
axiom: As egregious crimes under international law, war and genocide
need not be mutually exclusive. On the contrary, war could sometimes be
undertaken as an especially "efficient" manner of national, ethnical,
racial or religious annihilation. When the war in question is a nuclear
one, the argument becomes self-evident and unassailable.

A final thought dawns. [Our [**planet** displays]{.mark}]{.underline}
the same **[[fragility]{.underline}]{.mark}** an individual human life.
[Just [as a **person** can perish because of a **single
miscalc**]{.mark}ulation, **misjudgment** [or **accident**]{.mark}, so
too can [the **world as a whole** be subject to]{.mark} **singular
[error]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the final analysis, microcosm and
macrocosm are both made of ashes, and ashes signify elements of
incomparable importance. Most important here is that neither the
individual person nor the individual state can ever achieve safety at
the deliberate expense of designated others.

In world politics and world law, Realpolitik is inevitably a
prescription for despair. Left to its traditional endpoints of conflict,
war, **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and genocide, this
time-dishonored dynamic, worsened by ongoing transition from anarchy to
chaos, [[could propel]{.mark} entire [continents toward]{.mark}
irrecoverable **[nuclear w]{.mark}ar**]{.underline}. There is likely
still time for rescue, but only if humankind can first finally
acknowledge the global survival obligations of intellect or mind.

From Syria to Yemen in the Middle East, Libya to Somalia in Africa,
Afghanistan to Pakistan in South Asia, [**[an American aerial

swath of the planet. Its stated purpose: combating terrorism. [Its

**bombing**]{.underline}---and yet more bombing. [[Its **political**
benefit: minimizing]{.mark} the number of US **[boots on the

in the never-ending war on terrorism, as well as any [public

conflicts. [Its]{.underline} **[economic benefit]{.underline}**: [plenty

**national security emergency** whenever he likes and so sell their
warplanes and munitions to preferred dictatorships in the Middle

and **missiles** bursting **here, there, and everywhere.**]{.underline}

Think of all this as [[a [**cult of
bombing**](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175883)]{.underline}]{.mark} [on
a **global scale**]{.underline}. [America's [wars]{.mark} are
increasingly **[waged from the air]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not on the
ground---[a reality [that makes the prospect of **ending them**]{.mark}
ever more **[daunting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The question is: What's
driving this process?

[For many of America's decision-makers, **airpower** has clearly
**become something of an abstraction**]{.underline}. After all, [except
for]{.underline} the [9/11]{.underline} attacks by those four hijacked
commercial airliners, [Americans [haven't
been](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/174928) the target of such strikes
since World War II. On]{.underline} Washington's [battlefields across
the Greater Middle East and Northern Africa,]{.underline} [airpower is
always a **one-way affair**]{.underline}. There are no enemy air forces
or significant air defenses. The skies are the exclusive property of the
US Air Force (and allied air forces), which means that we're no longer
talking about war in the normal sense. [No wonder Washington
policy-makers and military officials see it as our **strong

[our way of settling scores with evildoers, real and
imagined.]{.underline}

BOMBS AWAY!

In a bizarre fashion, you might even say that [in the 21st century, the
bomb and missile count replaced the Vietnam-era body count as a **metric
of (false) progress**]{.underline}. Using data supplied by the US
military, [the Council on Foreign Relations estimated that the United
States dropped at least [26,172
bombs](https://www.cfr.org/blog/how-many-bombs-did-united-states-drop-2016) in
seven countries in 2016]{.underline}, the bulk of them in Iraq and
Syria. Against Raqqa alone, ISIS's capital, the United States and its
allies dropped more than [20,000
bombs](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/a-year-after-the-end-of-isis-control-in-raqqa-a-ruined-city-looks-to-rebuild) in
2017, reducing that provincial Syrian city
to [rubble](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/26/658142688/u-s-plan-to-stabilize-raqqa-and-stop-return-of-isis-doesnt-appear-to-be-working).
[Combined with artillery fire, [the **bombing of
Raqqa**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[killed]{.mark} more than **[1,600
civilians]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [according to [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/unprecedented-investigation-reveals-us-led-coalition-killed-more-than-1600-civilians-in-raqqa-death-trap/)]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, since Donald Trump became president, after claiming that he
would get us out of our various never-ending wars, US bombing has
surged, not only against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq but
in [Afghanistan](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/16/without-saying-so-u-s-raises-the-stakes-in-afghanistan-from-the-air/) as
well. It has driven up the [civilian death
toll](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/05/10/alarming-rise-civilian-deaths-war-terror?cd-origin=rss) there
even as friendly Afghan forces are sometimes mistaken for the enemy [and
killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-southern-afghanistan-nato-airstrikes-kill-up-to-18-police-officers/2019/05/17/f99c7d44-78a8-11e9-a7bf-c8a43b84ee31_story.html),
too. Air strikes
from [Somalia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes-shabab.html) to [Yemen](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-has-expanded-obamas-drone-war-to-shadow-war-zones-2018-11) have
also been on the rise under Trump, while civilian casualties due to US
bombing continue to
be [underreported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/16/magazine/uncounted-civilian-casualties-iraq-airstrikes.html?_r=0) in
the American media
and [downplayed](https://bracingviews.com/2017/11/19/u-s-air-strikes-and-civilian-deaths-in-the-war-on-terror/) by
the Trump administration.

US air campaigns today, deadly as they are, pale in comparison
with [past](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175665) ones like the Tokyo
firebombing of 1945 (which killed more than 100,000 civilians), the
atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki later that year (roughly
250,000), and those in World War II (at least 600,000 German civilians)
and the Vietnam War (estimates vary, but when napalm and the long-term
effects of [cluster
munitions](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37286520) and defoliants
like [Agent
Orange](https://www.pennlive.com/projects/2014/agent-orange/) are added
to conventional high-explosive bombs, the [death
toll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties) in Southeast
Asia may well exceed 1 million). [Today's]{.underline} air [strikes are
more limited]{.underline} than in those campaigns and may be more
accurate, [but never confuse a 500-pound bomb with a surgeon's scalpel,
even rhetorically]{.underline}. [When
"[surgical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_strike)" is applied
to **bombing** in today's age of **lasers, GPS, and other
precision-guidance technologies**]{.underline}, [it only **obscures**
the **very real**]{.underline} human **[carnage]{.underline}** [being
produced by all these American-made bombs and missiles]{.underline}.

[[This country's propensity for **believing**]{.mark} that [its
**ability to
rain [hellfire](https://www.military.com/equipment/agm-114-hellfire) from
the sky** provides a **winning methodology**]{.mark} **for its
wars**]{.underline} [[has proved to be a
**fantasy**]{.underline}]{.mark} of our age. [In Korea]{.underline} in
the early 1950s, [Vietnam]{.underline} in the 1960s, [or more recently
in Afghanistan]{.underline}, Iraq, and Syria, [the United States might
have controlled the air, but **that [dominance simply hasn't led to
ultimate success]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [In]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
case of **[Afghanistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [weapons like
the]{.underline}]{.mark} ["mother of all bombs,"]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} [**[[MOAB]{.underline}]{.mark}**](https://bracingviews.com/2017/05/15/icons-of-american-militarism/) (the
most powerful nonnuclear bomb in the US military's arsenal), [have been
celebrated as game changers **even when they [change
nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (Indeed, [the Taliban only continues
to [grow
**stronger**](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/numbers-afghanistan-are-not-good-n842651)]{.underline},
as does the branch of the Islamic State in Afghanistan.) [As is often
the case when it comes to US airpower, [such **destruction** leads
neither to **victory** nor to **closure**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[of any sort, [only to **yet more
destruction.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Such results are contrary to the rationale for airpower that I absorbed
in a career spent in the US Air Force. (I retired in 2005.)
The [fundamental
tenets](http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/afdc/afdd1-chap3.pdf) of
airpower that I learned, which are still taught, speak of decisiveness.
They promise that airpower, defined as "flexible and versatile," will
have "synergistic effects" with other military operations. When bombing
is "concentrated," "persistent," and "executed" properly (meaning not
micromanaged by know-nothing politicians), airpower should be
fundamental to victory. As we used to insist, putting bombs on target is
really what it's all about. End of story---and of thought.

Given the banality and vacuity of those official Air Force tenets, given
the 21st-century history of airpower gone to hell and back, and based on
my experience teaching such history and strategy in and outside the
military, I'd like to offer some airpower tenets of my own. These are
the ones the Air Force didn't teach me but that our leaders might
consider before launching their next "decisive" air campaign.

10 CAUTIONARY TENETS ABOUT AIRPOWER

1\. Just because US warplanes and drones can strike almost anywhere on
the globe with relative impunity doesn't mean that they should. Given
the history of airpower since World War II, **[ease of
access]{.underline}** [should never be **mistaken** for **efficacious
results.**]{.underline}

2\. [**[Bombing alone]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} **[never be the
key to victory]{.underline}**. [If that were true, the United States
would have easily won in **Korea**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
**[Vietnam]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as well as in [**Afghanistan** and
**Iraq**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [American airpower **pulverized** North
Korea and Vietnam]{.underline} (not to speak of neighboring [Laos and
Cambodia](http://www.thebigchilli.com/feature-stories/americas-secret-war-and-the-bombing-of-southeast-asia)),
[yet the Korean War ended in a **stalemate**]{.underline}, [and the
Vietnam War in **defeat**]{.underline}. (It tells you the world about
such thinking that airpower enthusiasts, reconsidering the Vietnam
debacle, tend to argue the United States should have bombed even
more---[lots
more](https://www.amazon.com/The-Limits-Air-Power-American/dp/0803264542).)
**[Despite total air supremacy]{.underline}**, [the recent **Iraq** War
was a **disaster**]{.underline} even as the Afghanistan War staggers on
into its 18th catastrophic year.

3\. [[No matter how much it's advertised as
**precise**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[discriminate]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline} **[measured]{.underline}**]{.mark},
[bombing]{.underline} (or using missiles like
the [Tomahawk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk_(missile)))
[rarely is.]{.underline} [[The deaths of innocents are
**guaranteed**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[Airpower and those
deaths]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[joined at the
hip]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and [such killings **generate anger and
blowback**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [thereby]{.underline} **[[prolonging
the wars they are meant to end.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Consider]{.underline}, for instance, the [decapitation strikes launched
against Iraqi autocrat Saddam Hussein]{.underline} and his top officials
in the opening moments of the George W. Bush administration's invasion
of 2003. [Despite the hype about that being the beginning of the most
precise air campaign in all of history]{.underline}, [50 of those
attacks]{.underline}, supposedly based on the best intelligence around,
**[failed to take out Saddam]{.underline}** or a single one of his
targeted officials. [They did, however, cause **dozens of civilian
deaths**]{.underline}. [Think of it as a monstrous repeat of the
"precision" air attacks launched on Belgrade in 1999 against [Slobodan
Milosevic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia) and
his regime that hit the [Chinese
Embassy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bombing_of_the_Chinese_embassy_in_Belgrade) instead,
killing three journalists.]{.underline}

Here, then, is the question of the day: [Why is it that, despite all the
**precision** talk about it, airpower so regularly proves]{.underline},
at best, **[a blunt instrument of destruction]{.underline}**? As a
start, [**intelligence** is often **faulty**.]{.underline} [Then bombs
and missiles, even smart ones, **do go astray**]{.underline}. [And even
when US forces kill [high-value
targets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-value_target)]{.underline} (HVTs),
[there are always **more HVTs**]{.underline} [out there]{.underline}. A
paradox emerges from almost 18 years of the war on terrorism:
[[The]{.underline} **[imprecision of airpower]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[leads]{.mark} only [to **repetitious cycles of
violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and even when air strikes prove
**precise**]{.underline}, [[there always turn out to be]{.mark} **fresh
targets, [fresh terrorists]{.mark}, fresh insurgents [to
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**[Warfare on land]{.underline}** [has always been among the most
**horrific** experiences a human being could go through]{.underline}.
[From ancient times, the warring sides sought ways of **avoiding** the
specter of crushed limbs and pierced bodies that inevitably came with
land battle]{.underline}. Single combat by champions was one ancient
means of minimizing casualties for both sides that persisted through the
millennia. Pre-modern generals could turn to negotiation and subterfuge
to gain a victory without the necessity of a bloodbath. If a fight was
necessary, commanders sought the dramatic, decisive battle that decided
the war within hours.

[Decisive battles were harder to come by once societies became
industrialized]{.underline}, [with the ability to field massive armies
to fight total war]{.underline}. Instead, [wars were increasingly
decided by a series of brutal tactical encounters]{.underline}, as both
sides sought to grind each other\'s forces down until they
capitulated.\[2\] [That process reached a ghastly peak in the trenches
of World War One]{.underline}, and in the aftermath leaders looked to
airpower as a way around land warfare which had become too costly. [In
1921, Giulio Douhet published his seminal work arguing that **airpower**
would make land armies **irrelevant**]{.underline}, [and that victory
could be gained by destroying civilian \"vital centers.\"]{.underline}

[In the century since]{.underline} Douhet\'s book, ground formations are
still a central component of warfare, but [Western airpower has grown in
capabilities and importance]{.underline}, transforming the way wars are
fought. Countries like Israel and the US have been wildly successful in
achieving air superiority. The last US soldier killed by enemy air
attack occurred back in 1953, and the US has never even been in a
position where an enemy plane was close enough for them to fire a
surface-to-air missile at it. \[3\] Indeed, US Army doctrine has over
the years has assumed air superiority. Israel has had its way with enemy
air forces, and since the total domination of Syrian planes in 1982, it
has enjoyed near total mastery of the skies.

It is clear that [[air supremacy is important]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[**[why exactly?]{.underline}** [Is it enough to]{.underline} **[gain
victory on its own?]{.underline}**]{.mark} [What does it
**enable**?]{.underline} [What is its **relationship** with **other
forms of military power**, especially **land power?**]{.underline}

Airpower Applied: U.S., NATO, and Israeli Combat Experience, edited by
John Andreas Olsen, seeks to clarify the potential and limits of
airpower. It does this through four chapters on the American, NATO, and
Israeli use of airpower, and one on the airpower profession itself. Each
chapter is written by different authors. While the chapters are useful
as standalone essays, they struggle to create a coherent whole beyond an
in-depth survey of the use of airpower by the US and Israel.

Western Airpower from World War II to Present

\"Chapter 1. America as a Military Aerospace Nation: From Pearl Harbor
to Desert Storm,\" by past Air Force Historian Richard P. Hallion,
investigates World War II (1939-45), Berlin Airlift (1948-49), Korean
War (1950-53), Vietnam War (1960-75), Operation El Dorado Canyon (1986),
Operation Just Cause (1989), and Operations Desert Shield and Desert
Storm (1990-91). It traces the development of US airpower from Kitty
Hawk in 1903 to \"the first air and space war,\" Desert Storm.

World War II was the first conflict in which no land or naval campaigns
could be conducted without considering both the offensive and defensive
air dimensions. It also proved the wisdom of the British approach of
creating an independent air force, which had the institutional focus and
wherewithal to fund the development of high-performance aircraft and
game-changing technologies like radar. In addition, it revealed the
importance of sound R&D, production, and doctrine, the lack of which led
to crucial failures by otherwise capable forces like France, Japan, and
Germany.

[The use of airpower [in **Vietnam**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} especially [instructive on the importance of clarity
from political leadership on what constitutes victory]{.underline}, and
the damaging effects of political interference in military decisions
like target selection. Operation Rolling Thunder In 1965, designed as a
limited air campaign to bring the North to the negotiating table, was a
prime example of failure on these fronts. Three of the operation\'s five
goals were psychological -- affecting the will of North Vietnam\'s
leadership, coercing the North to stop its aggression, and improving the
morale of the South, in addition to creating a bargaining chip and
reducing infiltration in to the South. Beyond these amorphous goals, it
lacked defined and unified command and control structure. What\'s more,
there was no updated joint doctrine for air operations, making it next
to impossible to achieve units of effort. Washington made matters worse,
with pervasive intervention by political leaders in tactical
decision-making, especially in the famous weekly Tuesday targeting
lunches in which approved target lists were made. Not surprisingly,
[**[Rolling Thunder]{.underline}** [**failed** to
accomplish]{.underline}]{.mark} [its stated [goals]{.mark}, while
costing the US **hundreds of aircraft.**]{.underline}

That being said, American airpower proved itself in many ways during the
war. The US accelerated the development of precision munitions, which
proved themselves against bridges, power plants, and mechanized assault.
American airpower in Operation Linebacker I (1972) stopped the massive
North Vietnamese invasion by destroying communications, supply columns,
and forces.

Operation **[[Desert Storm]{.underline}]{.mark}** [was a high point for
Western airpower]{.underline}, [especially precision
strikes]{.underline}. **[Unfortunately]{.underline}**, [it [created a
**false understanding** that **war could be
\"clean,\"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}
**[minimal]{.underline}**]{.mark} [civilian]{.underline}
**[[casualties]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It also showcased the
technological strides the US had made]{.underline} - the product of
significant investment and effort - in GPS, communications, guided
weapons, and sensors. 

Hallion stresses the important fact that the US lagged behind
significant innovations until the Vietnam War. These include radar,
turbojet engines, jet fighters, battlefield artillery rockets, ballistic
missiles, and human-carrying spacecraft. From the Vietnam War,
America\'s aerospace industry was an unparalleled leader in innovation.
Now, however, her adversaries are closing the gap quickly. He argues
that if the US is to retain its edge, it must recognize the importance
of technological investment.

\"Chapter 2. American and NATO Airpower Applied: From Deny Flight to
Inherent Resolve,\" by Benjamin Lambeth, examines Operation Deny Flight
(1993), Operation Deliberate Force (1995), Operation Desert Fox (1998),
Operation Allied Force (1999), Operation Enduring Freedom (2001),
Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003), Operation Unified Protector (2011), and
Operation Inherent Resolve (2014-2016).   It was a period in which the
tactical application of airpower continued to climb to new heights,
operations were conducted with almost blanket air superiority, while the
strategic effects of airpower were more qualified.

[Operation Deny Flight]{.underline}, [NATO\'s first air campaign, came
just after the apex of airpower\'s might in Desert Storm. It was meant
to enforce a no-fly zone]{.underline} over Bosnia and support UN troops
there. [But it quickly became clear it bore the trademarks of other
**half-hearted air campaigns**]{.underline} without a clear and
achievable political directive. UN restraints meant NATO aircraft could
do nothing that would influence Bosnian Serb behavior, and in the
operation\'s two years, there were only four CAS attacks (out of more
than a hundred requests) and five precision air
strikes.[\[4\]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/dado-center/dado-english-book-reviews/congratulations-you-have-air-superiority-now-what/#_ftn4) [The
operation]{.underline}, in Lambeth\'s words, \"[was reminiscent of
**every bad strategy choice** the U.S. government made throughout its
long and costly misadventure in **Vietnam**]{.underline}.\"

Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb targets was the next
step in NATO\'s campaign to support UN peacemaking efforts in the
Yugoslav civil war.  UN demands for total precision and minimal 
civilian casualties led to a situation in which each intended strike was
personally vetted by the campaign\'s air commander. Even in these
constraining conditions, the operation succeeded in accomplishing
specific objectives short of war.

Desert Fox, the four-day 1998 CENTCOM-led bombing campaign against
Saddam Hussein\'s regime to punish him for failing to meet the demands
of WMD inspectors, was undoubtedly a tactical success, with no loss of
US aircraft or civilian casualties. Still, it is not clear what the
successful military campaign was meant to accomplish. The word that
repeatedly cropped up from the US government was \"degrade\" -- Iraq\'s
WMD capabilities and military apparatus -- which is a nebulous,
impossible-to-measure term. The operation was \"uncoupled from any
coercive demands on Saddam,\" according to analyst Kenneth
Pollack.[\[5\]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/dado-center/dado-english-book-reviews/congratulations-you-have-air-superiority-now-what/#_ftn5)

[The 1999 campaign to stop Serbian abuses in Kosovo, Allied Force,
started with high hopes, but with the Clinton Administration publicly
ruling out a ground invasion.  It soon became clear]{.underline},
however, [that]{.underline} Slobodan [Milosevic was not about to change
course easily]{.underline}, **[especially]{.underline}** [when he knew
that a **ground invasion was off the table**]{.underline}, [and his
forces could easily **disperse** and **hide from attack**]{.underline}.
[Bombing intensified]{.underline}, and new targets like media, oil
refineries, and bridges were added to the list. It took 78 days of
bombing for Milosevic to agree to a peacekeeping force, but [the role of
airpower in brinhing about that desired result **remained a
question**]{.underline}. [Did the Serbs simply agree to a ceasefire
**once they had achieved their goals?**]{.underline} Was it the threat
of a NATO or Kosovo Liberation Army ground invasion that forced
Milosevic\'s hand? [American commanders weren\'t shy about airing their
grievances]{.underline}. [Adm. Leighton Smith Jr., NATO commander during
Deliberate Force, said it was \"**possibly the worst way we employed our
military forces**]{.underline} [in **history**]{.underline}.\" 

American and NATO airpower achieved unprecedented tempo and jointness
during the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns. But it seems that these
Western powers failed to learn lessons from the conflicts. Operations
Odyssey Dawn and Unified Protector in Libya led to the fall of Muammar
Gaddafi, but the ongoing civil war that has followed is reminiscent of
the highly effective air campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq that left
chaos in their midst, and gave terrorist organizations territory from
which to launch attacks. Without a willingness to use ground troops --
which the Obama Administration had absolutely no appetite for -- NATO
had little means of steering the post-Gaddafi outcome.

[The]{.underline} American-led air [campaign against
**ISIS**]{.underline} [was **even worse**]{.underline}. Lambeth calls
the operation \"overly measured, and halting\" with \"a conspicuous lack
of evident seriousness and senior leadership
determination.\"[\[6\]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/dado-center/dado-english-book-reviews/congratulations-you-have-air-superiority-now-what/#_ftn6) Like
in 1998, the word \"degrade\" was expressed by the Obama Administration
as the goal, which telegraphed \"his unwillingness to pursue anything
more than a minimalist response to the spread of ISIS.\" Lambeth argues
that [the campaign was \"**mindless target servicing**\"]{.underline}
[with no overriding strategic course of action]{.underline} or
well-defined goal. Political control over targeting has also hampered
America\'s ISR/Strike platforms, restraints that are \"without a doubt
the most obsessively restrictive of any air campaign ever fought by a
U.S.
coalition.\"[\[7\]](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/dado-center/dado-english-book-reviews/congratulations-you-have-air-superiority-now-what/#_ftn7) Once
a new American administration was in place after the publication of the
book, and the military was freed to conduct a more aggressive campaign
in concert with a ground invasion led by the Iraqi Army, Shiite miitias,
and Kurdish forces, the ISIS caliphate has been destroyed in Iraq.

Moving to the Israel Air Force (IAF), \"Chapter 3. Modeling Airpower:
The Arab-Israeli Wars of the Twentieth Century,\" by Alan Stephens,
looks at Israeli airpower from 1948 until 1982. Stephens argues that
Israel\'s consistent dominance over Arab adversaries stems from the
formula identified by  the chief of staff of the world\'s first air
force, the RAF\'s Hugh Trenchard: top-rate pilot\'s training, indigenous
R&D, a skilled technicians corps, a strong national economy, and a
quality educational system.

Several important points arise from the chapter.
[[When]{.underline}]{.mark} Israel\'s [[enemies finally grasped they
**could not contend with the**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[I**[AF]{.underline}** [in the **air**]{.underline}, [they moved toward
**asymmetrical responses**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [These include
**[hiding among civilians]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
**[[developing rocket arsenals]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[tunnels]{.underline}**, **[international terror]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[more]{.underline}**]{.mark}. In addition, we tend
to think of air forces winning air superiority. [The Yom Kippur War was
a firm reminder that]{.underline} **[ground-based air
defenses]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[armored
formations]{.underline}** [can **also** control the sky.]{.underline}

Overall, this chapter doesn\'t offer much that is new to the Israeli
practitioner. Moreover, the author\'s insistence on repeatedly accusing
Israel of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in asides that don\'t have
anything to do with airpower sticks out and only detracts from any
argument he would like to make on airpower.

\"Chapter 4. The Israeli Air Force and Asymmetric Conflicts,
1982-2014,\" by Raphael Rudnik and Ephraim Segoli (both former Dado
Center researchers) is a crucially important chapter. It centers around
dilemmas the IAF faced in adapting to an era of asymmetric wars after it
had become a dominant force in fighting Arab states.

Many of [the [syndromes that **affect**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**application** of US airpower **when it enjoys air
superiority**]{.underline} [crop up]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the Israeli
case]{.underline} as well. Already by Operation Accountability in 1993,
[[we]{.mark} [see an **aversion to ground
invasion**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that became a **decisive
factor**]{.mark} **in campaign planning**]{.underline}, [[the
expectation that there would be **minimal**]{.mark} **collateral
[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline} **[micromanagement of
tactical decisions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [by the **political
echelon**]{.underline} [which led to **complications in carrying out
attacks.**]{.underline}

The authors argue very clearly that [the senior leadership]{.underline}
of the IAF -- Eitan Ben Eliyahu, Dan Halutz, Amir Eshel - [believed and
argued openly that strategic air strikes could and should **replace
ground maneuver**.]{.underline} The IAF also believed that it could
become the leading service for the counterterrorism operations that
Israel has fought since 2000. As the nature of Israel\'s campaigns
changed, the air force displayed impressive intellectual and operational
flexibility, even developing a concept for \"holding territory\" through
sensors, which allowed it continuous observations of the battlespace.  

One is struck by the persistence of specific problems that resurface
throughout the period. One is ongoing tension between Northern Command
and IAF, which boiled over after the operations in Lebanon in 1993 and
1996. Northern Command felt the outcome strengthened and legitimized
Hezbollah, while the IAF saw the air-led operations as highly
successful.  The two bodies continued to talk past each other in 2006,
and failed to engage in close planning and discussions, planning their
missions almost independently.

Another problem that the IAF could not shake was the pattern of carrying
out preplanned missions exceptionally well, but failing to follow up
initial success. IAF operations in this period were marked by declining
effectiveness after the initial strike.

A final challenge, and one that perhaps defines the IAF\'s struggle to
this day, is the identification of viable targets despite consistently
improving assault capabilities. This was evident in Operation Grapes of
Wrath, and describes the rounds in Gaza as well. As Gen. Kobi Barak
wrote in the Dado Center Journal vol. 11-12, \"While we have improved
the precision of our strike capability from GPS coordinates of eight
digits to 10, 12, 14 even 15 digits (altitude), the enemy, in contrast,
has succeeded in frequently escaping from these targets before they
could be attacked. We destroy GPS coordinates, but struggle to hit the
actual enemy.\"

The body of Airpower Applied is a useful reference for almost all the
major operations undertaken by arguably the world\'s two leading air
forces since the 1940s, with some useful commentary. But the most
valuable analysis comes from the short afterword by Prof. Eliot
[Cohen]{.underline}. He [recognizes the extraordinary military success
that Israel and the US have achieved in the last seventy
years]{.underline}, [due in no small part to their air
superiority]{.underline}. [Cohen identifies the **downsides of this
success**]{.underline} -- [that [air superiority can **cover up serious
flaws**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [including]{.underline} **[logistical
problems and unskilled ground forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Moreover,
he argues, [[it can **make war seem easier than it is**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [can [give
**decision-makers**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[an]{.underline}
**[excuse]{.underline}** [to avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **difficult
and uncomfortable work of [strategic thinking]{.mark}** about
**objectives** and **how to achieve them**.]{.underline} Much like the
medic in basic training who offers Acamol and advice to drink more water
no matter the problem, [[bombing can be seen as a **cure-all** for **any
\"strategic ailment.\"**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Cohen also points out that [even with all that air superiority has done
for Israel and the US]{.underline}, **[it was never able to deliver
victory]{.underline}**. Without ground troops seizing territory, or at
least the threat of ground invasion, [tactical success from the air
**did not turn into** strategic success.]{.underline}

He argues that Israeli and [American air superiority could be entering a
period of **growing challenge**]{.underline}. Hezbollah UAVs and Hamas
rockets have Israelis looking up again nervously;
**[Chinese]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Iranian
surface-to-surface missiles]{.underline}** [threaten]{.underline}
**[American air bases]{.underline}**. Though air superiority will
remain, air supremacy will not. The era of \"airpower triumphalism\" is
over, writes Cohen, and now is the time for Western liberal democracies
to continue to develop their technological and manpower edge for the new
era.

Implications for the Future of Israeli Airpower

[The values, economy, and technology of Western democracies have enabled
countries like the US and Israel to build and maintain dominant air
forces]{.underline}, based on skilled pilots, cutting edge systems, and
massive government investment. [But these [Western societies have
**developed a characteristic**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} their
[**enemies have taken notice of,** and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[seek to
exploit]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[Somali]{.underline}** militia
[leader]{.underline} Mohammed Farah **[Aideed]{.underline}** told an
American official, \"We have studied Vietnam and Lebanon and know how to
get rid of Americans, by killing them so that public opinion will put an
end to things.\"\[8\] Saddam Hussein (\"Yours is a society which cannot
accept 10,000 dead in one battle.\") [and]{.underline} Slobodan
**[Milosevic]{.underline}** (NATO is \"not willing to sacrifice lives to
achieve our surrender.\") [both thought they were immune because of
**Western sensitivity to casualties.**]{.underline}

While they certainly were not immune, they were correct that America and
its allies prioritized minimizing casualties, and prefer airpower-heavy
campaigns in which they enjoy total air supremacy.

Israel\'s enemies have reached the same conclusion. Hezbollah leader
Hassan Nasrallah pins his strategy in a future conflict on causing heavy
casualties to IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians.\[9\] If Israel avoids
ground maneuver and relies on airpower, Hamas and Hezbollah will present
Israel with a dilemma. They will inflict pain on Israel\'s home front,
while forcing Israel to inflict civilian casualties, and bear the brunt
of international opprobrium.

Traditionally, air superiority has allowed Israel and the US to fight at
the strategic level -- by striking enemy C2 for example - while the
enemy is forced to try to gain victory while fighting at the tactical
level. Allows us to fight at the strategic while forcing enemy to fight
at tactical. \[10\] Now, Hamas and Hezbollah have flipped the script,
and are increasingly able to fight at the strategic level with precision
missiles while forcing Israel to try to string together a series of
tactical successes to stop them.

Facing this challenge, Israel\'s [**[aversion]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[casualty-heavy ground maneuver]{.underline}** [has
pushed it into operational concepts that **reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**the [effectiveness]{.mark}** [of both **airpower and ground
maneuver**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Airpower can play an important
role in defeating Hamas and Hezbollah, but not in isolation from other
coercive instruments.\[11\] Airpower is far less successful when used
alone, and measured through a binary lens. In Israel\'s coercion
operations, it must be used synergistically with other forms of
pressure, and measured as a component of a multi-faceted campaign.\[12\]

4\. [[Using airpower to send **political messages** about
**resolve**]{.underline}]{.mark} or seriousness **[[rarely
works.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [If it did, the United States would have
swept to victory in **[Vietnam]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In Lyndon
Johnson's presidency, for instance, Operation [Rolling
Thunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rolling_Thunder)]{.underline} (1965
to '68), a graduated campaign of bombing, [was meant
to]{.underline}---**[but didn't]{.underline}**---[persuade the North
Vietnamese to give up their goal of expelling the foreign
invaders]{.underline} (us) [from South Vietnam]{.underline}.
[Fast-forward to]{.underline} our era and consider recent signals sent

the Trump administration]{.underline} via B-52 bomber deployments, among
other military messages. [[There's **no evidence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that [either country **modified its behavior**]{.mark} significantly

those [baby-boomer-era](https://www.duffelblog.com/2019/05/baby-boomer-jet-realizes-it-may-never-be-able-to-retire/) airplanes.]{.underline}

5\. Airpower is enormously expensive. Spending on aircraft, helicopters,
and their munitions accounted for roughly half the cost of the Vietnam
War. Similarly, in the present moment, making operational and then
maintaining Lockheed
Martin's [boondoggle](https://bracingviews.com/2014/02/18/the-f-35-fighter-program-america-going-down-in-flames/) of
a jet fighter, the F-35, is expected to cost at least [\$1.45
trillion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lockheed-fighter/exclusive-u-s-sees-lifetime-cost-of-f-35-fighter-at-1-45-trillion-idUSBRE82S03L20120329) over
its lifetime. The new B-21 [stealth
bomber](http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176431) will cost more than
\$100 billion simply to buy. Naval air wings on aircraft carriers cost
billions each year to maintain and operate. These days, when the [sky's
the
limit](https://theintercept.com/2019/05/23/defense-spending-bill-senate) for
the Pentagon budget, such costs may be (barely) tolerable. When the
money finally begins to run out, however, the military will likely
suffer a serious hangover from its wildly extravagant spending on
airpower.

6\. [Aerial surveillance]{.underline} (as with drones), while useful,
[can also be misleading. **Command** of the **high ground**]{.underline}
is not synonymous with godlike total [situational
awareness](http://www.titan-vision.com/pages/hot-topics/total-situational-awareness.html).
It [can]{.underline} instead [prove to be a kind of
**delusion**]{.underline}, [while war practiced in its spirit often
becomes little more than an exercise in destruction.]{.underline} [You
simply can't negotiate a truce or take prisoners or foster other options
when you're high above a potential battlefield and your main recourse is
blowing up people and things]{.underline}.

7\. **[Airpower is inherently offensive]{.underline}**. [That means it's
more consistent with **imperial power projection** than with national
defense]{.underline}. As such, [it **fuels imperial
ventures**]{.underline} [while fostering the kind of [global-reach,
global-power](https://bracingviews.com/2014/07/12/global-reach-global-power-has-deep-roots-in-americas-past/) thinking
that has in these years had Air Force generals in its grip.]{.underline}

8\. [[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[fantasies]{.mark} of those
sending out the planes]{.underline}**, [[airpower often **lengthens wars
rather than shortens them**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Consider Vietnam
again]{.underline}. [[In the early]{.mark} 19[60s, the]{.mark} [**Air

[conflict]{.mark} at the **lowest cost**]{.underline} (mainly in
American bodies). [With enough bombs, napalm, and defoliants, victory
was a sure thing and US ground troops a kind of
afterthought]{.underline}. (Initially, they were sent in mainly to
protect the airfields from which those planes took off.) [**[But bombing

Two decades after the attacks of 9/11, [preventing and countering
terrorism continues to be one of the main challenges faced by policy
makers]{.underline}. [[The **threat of nuclear
terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is often **dismissed** as
**unlikely**]{.mark} or **not imminent**]{.underline}. [T]{.underline}he
mere circumstance that it seems unthinkable does not mean it should not
be actively prevented. [In fact,]{.underline} [[there are both
**examples of**]{.mark} [**threats** and **feasible pathways**
to]{.mark} conduct [nuclear terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}. Therefore,
[countering it can **no longer** be met with ignorance or
negligence.]{.underline}

[This year marks the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks]{.underline}
that reshaped how Western governments thought about security and
terrorism. Measured by the number of causalities, they remain among the
most severe terrorist events that have ever occurred. Yet, [that
day]{.underline}, [the **threshold to another**]{.underline}, [even
**more devastating** form of attack was alarmingly **low**]{.underline}:
[According to [the 9/11 Commission
Report](https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf)]{.underline},
although [the perpetrators]{.underline} chose more feasible and symbolic
targets in the end, they had [considered]{.underline} targeting [the
Indian Point Energy Center]{.underline} -- [a **nuclear power plant** 40
kilometers north of Manhattan]{.underline} -- to create a massive
release of radioactivity.

[While the human and environmental consequences of a terrorist attack
with nuclear]{.underline} or radiological [materials are barely
imaginable]{.underline}, **[[the threat]{.mark} of nuclear terrorism [is
real.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[Several terrorist
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [including]{.underline} [**[[Al

[[and]{.mark} the]{.underline} [so-called **[Islamic

(**[[IS]{.underline}]{.mark}**)](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-risk-of-a-nuclear-isi_b_8259978) --
[[have demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} their **[[nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a means of communicating with and
targeting their "enemies." Al Qaeda generally targets "the West"; North
Caucasian terrorists have chosen Russia as a less abstract enemy. As a
more recent example, [the [perpetrators of the 2015 attacks in
**Paris**](https://www.dw.com/en/a-nuclear-terrorism-threat-made-in-belgium/a-19191458) gathered

#### Afghanistan withdrawal [changed the game]{.underline}\-\--leakage of nuclear materials is [likely]{.underline} and causes [Indo-Pak nuclear war]{.underline}

Eric **Edelman &** Robert **Joseph 21**, Edelman is Counselor at the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and served as under
secretary of defense for policy from 2005 to 2009; Joseph is a senior
scholar at the National Institute for Public Policy and served as under
secretary of state for arms control and international security, from
2005 to 2007, "Afghanistan\'s Terrorist Future," Bulwark, 3-19-2021,
https://www.thebulwark.com/afghanistans-terrorist-future/

[After]{.underline} the [U.S. withdrawal, [Afghanistan]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} likely [become]{.mark} the world's **prime
[ungoverned]{.mark} space**]{.underline}. The timing of the withdrawal
announcement coincided with the release of the annual Director of
National Intelligence Global Threat Assessment, which concluded that
[after]{.underline} a [U.S.]{.underline} and allied [withdrawal,
Afghanistan will again [**descend** into **civil
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the result of which could be that [the
Taliban will]{.underline} **[again rule]{.underline}** in Kabul. The
assessment also suggests that the prospects for a negotiated settlement
were "low" and that the "Taliban is likely to make gains on the
battlefield, and the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban
at bay if the coalition withdraws support." The potential humanitarian
disaster and undoing of hard won gains, including for women's rights,
loom as dark consequences.

[The repercussions]{.underline} of chaos in Afghanistan [will be **felt
globally**]{.underline}. Like the American withdrawal from Vietnam,
Biden's decision will be seen as a sign of weakness, encouraging Russia,
China, Iran, and other adversaries to challenge U.S. interests. [It
will]{.underline} also [be [a **victory for
violent**]{.mark}]{.underline} Islamist **[[extremists]{.mark} around
the world]{.underline}**. After all, it was the initial U.S. abandonment
of Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal that initially enabled al
Qaeda to create a base of operations there. As the DNI assessment notes,
despite sustaining serious losses in the past years, the
[**[a]{.mark}**l **[Q]{.mark}**aeda leadership [will]{.mark}
**continue** "calls for **[attack]{.mark}**s against the United States
and other international targets [and]{.mark} seek to **[advance
plotting]{.mark}** around the world. Al Qa'ida's [**regional**
affiliates]{.mark} will [exploit **local conflicts** and **ungoverned
spaces** to **threaten U.S.**]{.mark} **and Western
[interests]{.mark}**, as well as local governments and populations
abroad."]{.underline}

That is why the Congressionally mandated, bipartisan Afghanistan Study
Group, co-chaired by former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph
Dunford and former Sen. Kelly Ayotte,

> was advised that a complete U.S. withdrawal without a peace agreement
> would allow these groups to gradually rebuild their capabilities in
> the Afghanistan-Pakistan region such that they might be able to attack
> the U.S. homeland within eighteen to thirty-six months. The Group,
> relying on its own collective judgments, agreed with this assessment.
> It also agreed that outside of Afghanistan, there are no practical
> alternative locations in the region from which to conduct effective
> U.S. counterterrorism operations against threats from Afghanistan.
> \[Emphasis added.\]

There has not been another 9/11 since 9/11---but that was never a
guarantee.

The Afghanistan Study Group also touched---if glancingly---on the
subject of nuclear terrorism. It noted that [concerns]{.underline}
"**[remain]{.underline}** [about the possibility of **[nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [falling into the hands of a terrorist
organization. It is difficult to assess the probability of this
happening, but the [consequences would be **deadly**]{.mark}. The
possibility of a **terrorist nuclear attack** on the United States could
**not be entirely ruled out**."]{.underline}

The group pointed out that [[the complex of **jihadists**]{.mark}
factions [that]{.mark} have [battled U.S.]{.mark} and Afghan [forces are
**intertwined** with]{.mark} those that **threaten the stability of
[South Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, more
specifically, those that [[threaten to spark]{.mark} a [**conflict**
between]{.mark} two **[nuclear-armed]{.mark} states, [India and
Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As their report observed, "[any group
that could [increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of **nuclear
conflict**]{.mark} or the **dispersal of nuclear
materials**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[weapons]{.underline}** in
South Asia, [especially to **nonstate** groups, could **[severely
threaten regional stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, U.S. allies and
interests, [and [even **American** territory]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The report does not unspool this potential scenario in any detail, but
it is not difficult to imagine how such a catastrophe could come to
pass. The first and most likely step is that the U.S. and allied
withdrawal leads to an intensified civil war in Afghanistan with the
Taliban making territorial gains against the elected Afghan government.
The result is a large-scale out-flow of refugees, mostly to Pakistan (it
is worth recalling that in the 1980s and 1990s, the Afghan refugee
population was the largest in the world). In Pakistan, the
**[[refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}** become a fertile breeding ground for
Islamist extremism, a useful pool of recruits for terrorist groups, and
[add]{.underline} **[enormous [stress]{.mark}es]{.underline}** [to
[the]{.mark} already [fragile **Pakistani** state]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The Pakistani government is already increasing its nuclear weapons
capacity, including by scaling up its production of enriched uranium and
plutonium]{.underline}. Unclassified estimates suggest [it may already
possess the world's fifth-largest and fastest-growing nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. It currently possesses as many as 160 nuclear
weapons, produces enough fissile material for up to 15 warheads per
year, and could be on track to surpass the U.K.'s arsenal.

[The Afghanistan-Pakistan border is over 1600 miles long, mountainous,
and notoriously **poorly governed on both sides**]{.underline}. It also
includes a portion of the Gilgit-Baltistan area of Pakistan that India
claims as part of the larger Kashmir dispute.

[Pakistani-sponsored [jihadists]{.mark} executed a deadly
[attack]{.mark} in **[Mumbai]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2008. [With more
**recruits**]{.underline} among the Afghan refugee population and a
favorable strategic posture vis-à-vis their Indian neighbors, [they
[might]{.mark} be **encouraged**]{.underline} at some point in the
months or years after the American withdrawal [to execute]{.underline}
**[multiple]{.underline}** such [attacks, which would be the next [step
toward **nuclear terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response,
**[India]{.underline}** [turns to its]{.underline} superior
**[conventional]{.underline}** [forces as a means of
**reprisal**]{.underline}. As Indian armored columns approach the
Pakistani border, the **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**i Army widely
**[[disperses]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, both [[to]{.mark} ensure]{.underline} their
**[survivability]{.underline}** against an Indian first strike, [and to
[enable a]{.mark} [blunting **strike**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
short-range missiles to stop India from breaching the border and
threatening the existence of the Pakistani state.

Suddenly, [in the middle of a crisis or]{.underline} even an all-out
[war, hundreds of nuclear weapons are **stationed**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} largely **[ungoverned areas]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} [**networks of radical Islamist militants**. To
experts who spend their time thinking (and worrying) about nuclear
terrorism, this is the **most feared scenario**]{.underline}. And after
September 11, 2021, the U.S. will not have the necessary military forces
nearby capable of rapidly responding to the crisis that loose nuclear
weapons would inevitably create. In that context President Bidenmight
want to recall President Obama's warningfive years ago that "The danger
of a terrorist group obtaining and using a nuclear weapon is [[one of
the **greatest threats to global security**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

https://www.stimson.org/2021/u-s-priorities-for-reducing-the-risk-of-nuclear-terrorism/

For decades, [U.S. officials have expressed]{.underline} that [reducing
the threat of nuclear terrorism is a national security
priority]{.underline}. [Despite a history of broad bipartisan
support]{.underline}, [funding]{.underline} [for nuclear security
programs has steadily declined]{.underline} over the past decade. [The
United States has taken a back seat with international
leadership]{.underline} and cooperation on nuclear security [even though
**[adequate security measures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}
**[lacking for fissile materials]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} [[nuclear terrorism threats **continue
evolving**]{.underline}]{.mark}. International cooperation is necessary
to strengthen security around nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons-useable
nuclear material, and nuclear faculties where sabotage could pose a
significant risk. The Biden administration can take critical steps to
ensure states stay ahead of the constantly evolving threat of nuclear
terrorism by increasing nuclear security program funding, engaging with
countries that face significant risks, and strengthening international
treaties around nuclear security.

[An act of nuclear terrorism]{.underline} anywhere in the world [would
be a global humanitarian, economic, and political
catastrophe]{.underline}, and would undermine the role of nuclear
technology for energy, medical, industrial, and other purposes.
Unfortunately, **[[this is not a hypothetical
concern]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Well-resourced]{.mark} terrorist
[groups]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[espousing **apocalyptic**]{.underline}
**[ideology]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have [pursued nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} in the past]{.underline}. While [[nobody knows **who
will be the next**]{.mark} to pursue a nuclear weapon]{.underline} or
attempt to sabotage a nuclear power plant, U.S. leadership is needed to
ensure the international community continues to reduce the danger by
effectively protecting the hundreds of nuclear facilities and transport
operations around the world.

Problem

U.S.  programs to strengthen security at nuclear facilities around the
world are among the few nuclear policy issues with strong bipartisan
support. Every president, from President Clinton to President Trump, for
nearly three decades has said reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism
was a national security priority. Despite this support, the United
States has taken a back seat in strengthening nuclear security around
the world in recent years, and progress is slowing. U.S. funding for
strengthening nuclear security has declined significantly.
[The]{.underline} **[scope and scale]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[multilateral and bilateral [nuclear security
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[has been
**diminishing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly [with countries like
China and Russia which face]{.mark} **significant
[risks]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[Countries are **not keeping up**

by]{.mark} **[emerging tech]{.mark}nologies**]{.underline} such as

[There is no consensus on **just** how serious [the threat]{.mark} of
nuclear terrorism is]{.underline}.22 [This is because it [is]{.mark}
**very [hard to judge]{.mark} with any confidence**]{.underline}. That
said, at the time of writing this second edition of this book (in 2020),
there is a feel- ing that the nuclear terrorist threat is not as acute,
or at least does not domi- nate the nuclear security debate to the
extent that it did a decade ago. John **[[Mueller]{.underline}]{.mark}**
for one [[has been]{.mark} **highly [sceptical]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the nuclear terrorism "hype":

> weapons or are remotely capable of obtaining them should the desire to
> do so take hold of them. If they try, there are a host of practical
> and organisational difficulties that make their likelihood of success

[[Nevertheless, governments]{.mark} around the globe have **[treated the
threat as serious]{.mark}** and **pressing**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[continue to do so]{.underline}**. Table 9.1 gives
an overview of the differ- ing views of the threat of nuclear terrorism:

According to David Albright, Osama [[bin Laden **approached A. Q. Khan
several times**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the 1990s [[seeking]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[-related
[material]{.mark}]{.underline}** but was rebuffed.24 However, it is
believed that [a]{.underline} **[rival]{.underline}** [of Khan's within
[the **Pakistani**]{.mark} nuclear [hierarchy]{.mark}, Sultan
Bashiruddin Mahmood, [did **meet several times**]{.mark} with bin Laden
and other leading members of Al Qaeda, [and]{.mark} may have **[promised
nuclear]{.mark}-related [tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} through the
Ummah Tameer-e-Nau network.25 Indeed, in 1998 [bin Laden
[declared]{.mark}]{.underline}:

> [[Acquiring]{.underline} \[**[nuclear]{.underline}**]{.mark} and

> It would be a sin for Muslims not to try to possess the weapons that
> would prevent the infidels from inflicting harm on Muslims.26

[However, the [possibility of]{.mark} a **[safe haven in
Afghanistan]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a possible Al Qaeda nuclear bomb
project **[ended]{.underline}** [when the **Taliban**]{.underline}
regime [was]{.underline} **[toppled]{.underline}** in 2001 by coalition

[Nevertheless]{.underline}, and while US Special Forces killed Osama Bin
Laden at a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan on 2 May 2011,27
[the]{.underline} **[spectre and possibility]{.underline}** [of a
nuclear threat from Al Qaeda]{.underline} and associated groups
**[[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, in the past decade the
nuclear

\[TABLE 9.1 OMITTED\]

terrorist threat has shifted to a new entity, closely linked with Al
Qaeda, known as the Islamic State (or Daesh, ISIS or ISIL). It is
believed that ISIS has tried to acquire the material needed to make a
dirty bomb,28 and in 2014 allegedly captured nuclear materials from
Mosul University. In 2016, NATO warned that ISIS might be plotting to
carry out biological and nuclear attacks in Europe.29 However, in March
2019 a "territorial victory" was declared over ISIS in Syria, which is
likely to make any nuclear ambitions far more difficult.30

How Might Terrorists Get a Nuclear Device or Cause
a Nuclear/Radiological Disaster?

There are a number of ways that a terrorist group might seek to acquire
and use a nuclear bomb.31 [The [most difficult]{.mark} and **least
likely**]{.underline} (though not impos- sible) [method [would be for a
terrorist group to **build** a bomb]{.mark} from
**scratch**]{.underline} without any outside help and in complete
secrecy. Slightly more plausible is that terrorists could steal or
somehow acquire a working bomb or the fissile material that could then
be used in a very crude Improvised Nuclear Device. At a slightly lower
level, terrorists might choose to attack a nuclear mili- tary facility
or civilian nuclear power plant, use more easily accessible radioac-
tive material in a radiological dirty bomb or seek to cause or
exacerbate a nuclear crisis in other ways. However, it is worth noting
that even if a terrorist group did acquire a nuclear device or the
ability to create a nuclear disaster, this would not automatically mean
that it was to be used/carried out. Indeed, evidence suggests that
certain groups might use such a capability principally as a bargaining
chip or as a threat.32

By far the most difficult pathway would be to build a bomb from scratch.
It is highly unlikely that any terrorist group could do this without
considerable outside help (e.g. from a nation state, see below). [[Each
stage of the process would be]{.mark} **[incredibly difficult]{.mark}**
to master; producing the necessary fissile mate- rial and fabricating
the weapons would be an enormous challenge and would require access to
sophisticated modern facilities. Producing a working dirty bomb would be
easier, but still require significant expertise, time and money. Even if
a terrorist group were to acquire all the necessary material and tech-
nology for a nuclear bomb]{.underline} (for example through an illicit
source similar to the A. Q. Khan network), [they would still need a
place to build and maybe test it (the firing mechanism rather than a
full nuclear expulsion), which would almost certainly require state
support]{.underline}.33 [Finally, terrorists must seek to pro- duce such
a weapon in complete secrecy, which would be very difficult, if not
impossible.]{.underline}

[A [more **likely**]{.mark} pathway [could be]{.mark} through a
**terrorist group [acquiring a bomb and fissile
material]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In theory while there is no reason why
a state could not provide a terrorist organisation with either a working
nuclear bomb or the fissile material needed for a weapon, a bigger
threat is that terrorists could acquire the necessary knowhow,
technology and material illicitly to produce their own. The illicit
acquisition of fissile material is perhaps a greater threat than a state
providing terrorists with a working bomb, although such a move would
still have significant ramifications for the state or organisations
involved should the transfer be uncovered. However, if terrorists did
acquire sufficient fissile material, they could certainly build a crude
Improvised Nuclear Device.

[Or a potentially much **easier** option would be to build a
**radiological** weapon such as a **dirty bomb**]{.underline} (see
below). While debate remains about whether a "rogue state" might provide
terrorists with nuclear weapons,34 it is generally accepted that a
number of national government authorities were complicit to varying
degrees in the A. Q. Khan network.35

In May ,2015 [**[ISIS]{.underline}** [announced]{.underline}]{.mark}
[their [desire to obtain a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon34]{.underline}.
[Despite this shocking announcement, it was clear that [the]{.mark}
terrorist [organization had **no technical**]{.mark} **nuclear
[expertise]{.mark} even during its great power stage**]{.underline}
between 2014- 2015. [The]{.underline} [group]{.underline} then
[[resorted to]{.mark} trying to **[purchase]{.mark}** nuclear [weapons,
using]{.mark} their **large [revenues]{.mark} at that
time**]{.underline}, which had reached about \$80 million a month35.
[Two months before ISIS announced their desire to buy an atomic bomb,
there was **another incident to sell nuclear materials36**]{.underline}.

[In the five years [preceding ISIS' announcement, law enforcement
authorities]{.mark} in some parts of Eastern Europe **[foiled four
separate attempts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by gangs that sought to
**sell**]{.mark} [radioactive materials to
extremists]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2010, [three individuals were
arrested for selling enriched uranium]{.underline}. In 2014,
[investigators thwarted an attempt to sell unenriched uranium to a
potential buyer in the Middle East for \$15,000]{.underline}. [Six of
the smugglers were arrested, while five others were able to escape,
fleeing with nuclear materials in their possession]{.underline} 37. [Two
months before ISIS announced their desire to buy an atomic bomb, there
was another incident to sell nuclear materials38]{.underline}.

[**[These]{.mark}** five years [mark only **one episode** in the
nuclear]{.mark} materials' [black market, but]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[similar]{.underline}** [incidents have taken place both **before**
and **after**]{.underline}]{.mark} [this, [which **cannot be
forgotten**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1996, Al-Qaeda's second-in-command
Ayman Al-Zawahiri, sought to buy nuclear materials from Chechen
extremist groups in conjunction with the intense global search for
nuclear materials that disappeared after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, to prevent extremist's accesses. Western security reports have
confirmed that Al-Qaeda had already bought 20 nuclear bags for \$30
million in cash and two tons of refined heroin in laboratories in
Afghanistan39. The attempts of terrorist organizations to purchase
nuclear materials did not stop very recently. In 2016, six people were
arrested in Georgia while attempting to sell more than one kilogram of
uranium in the black market for three million dollars40, this being the
second arrest of its kind in a month41.

[The main [concern about 'catalytic nuclear war']{.mark}]{.underline} --
and 'Nth country problem' more broadly -- in the late 1950s and
early-1960s [[centered on]{.mark} the [fear]{.mark} that a
[small]{.mark} or new nuclear [power would **deliberately** set a
**major exchange in motion**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the United
States and the Soviet Union. 1 As its name suggests, the concept was
inspired by chemical reactions where the catalyzing agent (a third-party
actor) would remain unscathed by its initiated process. 2 In his seminal
work on 'catalytic nuclear war' in 1962, Donald Kobe defines the notion
of 'catalytic war' as the possibility that [a third party's actions
**induce** a **nuclear** war between the **two nuclear-armed
opponents**]{.underline}. [[A third-party attack]{.mark} on
**nuclear-power**]{.underline} [[would be **misattributed**]{.mark} to
another state, thus [sparking a **catalytic 'chain
reaction**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}
**[retaliation]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[and
counter-retaliation]{.underline}**.' 3 A broader definition of
'catalytic nuclear war' **[[encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[situations in which the]{.underline} catalyzing actor ([non-state or
another third party]{.underline}) [initiates [a **simulated**
attack]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., [a false alert]{.underline}) [[that
produces the **effect** of]{.mark} an [imminent
attack]{.mark}]{.underline} [on one or both of the nuclear-armed
adversaries, [for which **pre-emption**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[is]{.mark} [considered]{.mark} the]{.underline} most
[[expedient]{.underline}]{.mark} (or **[only]{.underline}**)
**[strategic recourse]{.underline}**. 4 This broadened definition, and
used in this article, includes any process by which a third-party actor
uses its capabilities to involve nuclear-armed strategic rivals in a war
intentionally or to increase the scope or intensity of a situation. 5
The paper's originality lies in revisiting the 'catalytic nuclear war'
concept, considered by many as unworkable, and reconceptualizing it in
light of technological change, as well as improved understanding of
human psychology and other factors.

[Because nuclear powers must have some policy of
**retaliation**]{.underline} (i.e., massive, proportional, finite, or
random) [in order to act as a deterrent, this chain reaction **may**,
under certain circumstances, become a **self-fulfilling
prophecy**]{.underline}. For instance, the common fear of pre-emption
caused by one or both states is vulnerable to a first strike, or if a
state's command, control, and communication structures are compromised
following an attack. 6 [This]{.underline} situation [would be
**compounded**]{.underline} [by the presence of higher]{.underline}
**[numbers]{.underline}** [of nuclear-armed states -- or nuclear
multipolarity -- with varied, and possibly conflicting, retaliation and
deterrence postures]{.underline}. 7 Moreover,
**[miscalculation]{.underline}**, misperception, or an irrational act,
[would]{.underline} also **[increase]{.underline}** [the risk of
**catalytic war**]{.underline}. 8 At the root of these conditions is
human psychology, which strains the credibility of arguments that
human-rationality, perceptions, and nuanced signaling ensure that
deterrence will prevail.

[Classical]{.underline} nuclear **[deterrence]{.underline}** policies,
[premised on the assured threat of a retaliatory second
strike]{.underline} (or mutually assured destruction (MAD)), [are a
fundamentally **psychological-political-technical
phenomenon**]{.underline} that has worked to reduce the chances of
deliberate use of nuclear weapons. 9 This article argues that
[increasingly sophisticated, interdependent, and vulnerable]{.underline}
nuclear command, control, and communications (**[NC3]{.underline}**)
**[systems]{.underline}** -- [the]{.underline} **[bedrock]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} the [mutual deterrence]{.underline} regime between
nuclear-armed states -- **[increases]{.underline}** [the risks
associated with unintentional catalytic nuclear war]{.underline}. 10 The
article is not a treatise on the motives or goals of non-state motives
for committing such acts, but rather [the evolving means at the disposal
of [actors]{.mark} to]{.underline} **[[actualize]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[their]{.underline} **[malevolent goals]{.underline}** -- [or
'[apocalyptic world views']{.mark} -- in the digital age]{.underline}.
11 There is a rich body of literature on the intersection of emerging
technology and the nuclear enterprise -- and the potential for warfare
more broadly defined. 12 However, there is a relative paucity of
research on how existing concepts of escalation, **[[nuclear
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and classical deterrence theories
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} apply (or [[be]{.underline}
**[tested]{.underline}**]{.mark}) [[in the]{.mark} **digital
[age]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are [increasingly [defined by]{.mark}
developments in **artificial intelligence**]{.underline}
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [and]{.underline}
**[autonomy]{.underline}** perfect information and rational
decision-making cannot be assumed. 13 Are existing theories of military
escalation still applicable in the era of AI and autonomy? 14

The remainder of the article proceeds as follows. First, it
contextualizes the concept of 'catalytic nuclear war' with emerging
security technologies, particularly AI. The article uses this analytical
framework to examine how and under what circumstances the nefarious
**[(mis)use]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} these [technologies
by]{.underline} non-state actors (i.e., **[terrorists]{.underline}**,
criminals, and state-proxy actors) [might [create]{.mark} or exacerbate
[escalation pathways]{.mark} leads [to]{.mark} an **[accidental nuclear
confrontation between nuclear]{.mark}-armed
[powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Next, in the articles' empirical core,
it considers four aggravating features in the interaction of emerging
technology with nuclear weapons and the pathways to nuclear escalation
examined in the article -- information complexity and asymmetry; greater
automation of NC3; disinformation, misinformation, and information
manipulation; and nuclear multipolarity. 15 This article posits that
AI-enhanced capabilities will likely amplify these underlying conditions
(or second-order effects), thus increasing the risk of sparking
unintentional escalation between strategic nuclear-armed powers --
especially in crisis and conflict conditions. The next section uses four
fictional scenarios -- cyber false flag operation, cyber-attack on
nuclear early-warning systems, drone swarming targeting ISR systems, and
deepfake disinformation -- to demonstrate how AI-enhanced capabilities
in the hands of non-state actors might accidentally or inadvertently
drag a competitive nuclear dyad into conflict. The final section
considers possible ways of reducing catalytic escalation risk caused by
non-state actors, particularly how militaries can maintain effective
command and control of their nuclear forces in a rapidly evolving and
complex conflict environment.

Lastly, [[terrorist groups]{.mark} could]{.underline} seek to
**[[exacerbate]{.mark} a [nuclear crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** or cause
or a nuclear disaster indirectly. For example, [by [attempting
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[escalate a crisis]{.underline}**

And [what standards of **international order** and law would still
hold]{.underline} sway? [[The country attacked might]{.mark} well
**[lash out militarily]{.mark}**]{.underline} at whatever countries it
thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A terrifying
description of the kinds of discussions that might occur appeared in
Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) [[With the nuclear
threshold]{.mark} already [crossed]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
scenario---at least by terrorists---it [is conceivable that some of the
resulting [conflicts]{.mark} might **[escalate to nuclear
use.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [International politics could
become]{.underline} more **[brutish]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[violent,]{.underline}** [with powerful states taking unilateral
action]{.underline}, [by force]{.underline} if necessary, in an effort
to ensure their security. [After 9/11, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [led the invasions of
two sovereign nations]{.underline}, in wars that have since cost
hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, while plunging
a region into chaos. [Would the reaction after a far more devastating
nuclear attack be any less?]{.underline}

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
[Powerful states would likely demand]{.underline} that [others surrender
their nuclear material or accept foreign troops]{.underline} (or other
imposed security measures) to guard it.

[That could well be the first step toward a more **profound
transformation of the international system**]{.underline}. After such a
catastrophe, [[major powers may feel compelled to]{.mark} more freely
[engage in **preventive war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, seizing territories
they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens, and taking other
steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve their security. For
this reason, [foreign policy analyst Stephen Krasner has
argued]{.underline} that ["conventional [rules of sovereignty **would be
abandoned overnight**]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[Confidence
in]{.underline}]{.mark} both the national security institutions of the
country attacked and [[international institutions]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} the [International Atomic Energy Agency and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, which had so
manifestly failed to prevent the devastation, [might
[erode]{.mark}]{.underline}. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

#### Yes retal\-\--domestic pressure, confusion, preemptive pressures, and latent tension

Seth **Baum et al. 18**, Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, "A Model
for the Probability of Nuclear War", SSRN Electronic Journal, Crossref,
doi:10.2139/ssrn.3137081

The second type of non-war nuclear detonation is the detonation of a
nonstate nuclear weapon, by which we specifically mean the detonation of
nuclear weapons that are built by nonstate actors. Building a nuclear
weapon is a difficult technical and organizational challenge, especially
for a group that lacks a state's resources and control of territory.
However, [[it may be possible for nonstate groups to
**build**]{.underline}]{.mark} their own **[[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bunn and Wier 2006). Over the years,
nonstate groups such as **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**l
**[[Q]{.underline}]{.mark}**aeda [[and]{.underline} **[Aum
Shinrikyo]{.underline}** [have attempted]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
acquire nuclear weapons from states and to build their own]{.underline}.

The third type of non-war nuclear detonation is accidental detonation.
To date, no nuclear weapon has detonated by accident, but there have
been several incidents that may have come close to accidental detonation
(Schlosser 2013). The model distinguishes between accidental detonations
that occur on home soil, in which a nuclear-armed state accidentally
bombs itself, and those that occur on foreign soil, in which the state
accidentally bombs another state. This distinction is important because
accidental detonations are more likely to occur on home soil, but ones
on foreign soil are especially likely to be perceived as an intentional
attack. Indeed, the victim state may be unable to discern accident from
intentional attack.

All three types of non-war nuclear detonations share similar dynamics
for going from detonation to nuclear war. [A nuclear-armed state must
believe some other nuclear-armed state is responsible and]{.underline}
must [decide to conduct a nuclear attack in]{.underline} [what
it]{.underline} **[believes]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[retaliation]{.underline}**. The nuclear-armed state that makes the
"retaliation" attack could be, but does not need to be, the state that
is the victim of the initial detonation. The following discussion refers
to the various parties as the victim state, the attacker state (which
could be the victim state), the blamed state, and the perpetrators (if
the detonation was not an accident).

Ayson (2010) describes the dynamics in detail in the context of nuclear
terrorism. [[The attacker state could blame another state because, for
example, it believes that the blamed state: (1) **conducted the
attack**]{.underline}]{.mark} on its own; [([2) conducted the attack
in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[collaboration]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with
the terrorist]{.underline} perpetrators, perhaps in hope of dodging
blame; [[or]{.mark} (3) did not conduct the attack, but **[should have
prevented it]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} such as by shutting down
the terrorist group or preventing it from acquiring the nuclear
weapon(s). The first possibility is especially likely if the real
perpetrators cannot readily be identified. The second and third
possibilities are especially likely if the real perpetrators are
identified and they have ties to the blamed state. [**[Domestic pressure
to]{.mark} [act]{.mark}**, **[confusion]{.mark}** in the aftermath of
the attack,]{.underline} [**[fears]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[**additional attacks**, and]{.underline} **[preexisting
tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [with the blamed state could [make the
attacker state **further inclined to launch its nuclear
weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, the ability to
identify the perpetrators and defeat them with non-nuclear force and
concerns about breaking the taboo against states using nuclear weapons
could make the attacker state less inclined to launch.

[The attacker state's ability to correctly identify the perpetrator is
not guaranteed. Some information can be obtained via technical
analysis]{.underline} of physical properties of the detonated bomb, a
process known as nuclear forensics. [However, [current U.S. **nuclear
forensic** capabilities are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[limited]{.underline}**]{.mark} (NRC 2010), [and other states'
capabilities are likely even more limited. [Nuclear forensics would also
only identify the **origin**]{.mark} of the bomb, not]{.underline}
**[who delivered it]{.underline}**. Other information may be more
productive. Conventional terrorist attacks---especially large ones---are
frequently attributed to their terrorist perpetrators and in turn any
state sponsors; this suggests that attribution of nuclear terrorism is
likely to succeed even without technical forensics (Lieber and Press
2013). The question then would be whether attribution can occur fast
enough to inform attacker state decision-making.

[Even if the perpetrator is identified, the attacker state could **still
launch**]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[nuclear attack]{.underline}**.
The ensuing nuclear war could be classified under either of the two main
model branches, depending on whether the attacker state correctly assess
the role of other states. If it identifies the perpetrator and
mistakenly believes another state is complicit, then the nuclear war
would be classified under the second branch. If the perpetrator has
close ties to the blamed state, then it may be difficult to believe that
the state played no role. This is especially true if the perpetrator is
a rogue faction of the blamed state's military, or if the detonation was
an accidental detonation on foreign soil in a state with poor relations
with the blamed state. [Rogue elements of a state's military could
further leave the attacker state especially inclined to "retaliate"
because [the initial attack could **seem close to an act of
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and because additional attacks could be
imminent. Relative to an outside]{.underline} (e.g., terrorist) [group,
it could be relatively easy for military insiders to acquire and
detonate multiple weapons. The attacker state could legitimately wonder
if the blamed state still had control of its own nuclear
forces.]{.underline}

### Airpower Bad\-\--Terror\-\--Impact\-\--AT: No Motive\-\--2NC

#### [Tons]{.underline} of motives for nuclear terror

Andrew **Futter 21**, Associate Professor of International Politics and
Director of Research for Politics and International Relations at the
University of Leicester, "Nuclear Weapons and Non-State Actors," The
Politics of Nuclear Weapons, Springer International Publishing, 2021,

In this regard, [[the biggest]{.mark} nuclear [concern]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} terrorist [groups that are **ideological** rather than
political]{.mark}]{.underline}, those that can operate without
significant state support, and groups with members that may be prepared
to sacrifice their own lives for their cause. Suicide terrorists and
martyrs may therefore repre- sent the biggest nuclear danger.

Unlike nation states, it is doubtful that a terrorist group would choose
to deliver a nuclear device by ballistic missile or aircraft (although
not impossi- ble), since access to these types of capability would also
probably require con- siderable help from a nation state and probably be
unnecessary for what the terrorist group was trying to achieve (although
a nuclear-capable missile or airplane could theoretically be stolen,
hijacked or even hacked). Instead, it is more likely that a nuclear
device would be hidden in a shipping container or a truck, as a small
nuclear bomb would be incredibly difficult to detect enter- ing a port
or a city, or via a direct attack on a civilian or military nuclear
instal- lation.16 As a result, if a terrorist group bent on mass
destruction were to acquire a nuclear device or build a dirty bomb
(which spreads radiation but does not involve a nuclear yield) or gain
access to a nuclear weapon in another way, it would be very difficult to
defend against its use, irrespective of intelli- gence, border security
and other means of detection and prevention.

Nuclear terrorism is a label that refers to a broad range of groups and
enti- ties with different intentions and that might use a nuclear device
in different ways. According to Charles Ferguson and William Potter,17
[there are **[four types]{.mark}** of terrorist groups that [might
seek]{.mark} to acquire [a **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon;]{.underline}

> [• **[Apocalyptic]{.underline}** [groups]{.underline}]{.mark}. Groups

#### There are [clear ideological]{.underline} AND [tactical]{.underline} motives for nuclear terrorism

Center for Combating Extremist Ideology, "The Great Threat: Extremism
and the Spread of Nuclear Terrorism," Etidal, July 2021,

2\. Ideological Motives

Currently, international institutions have committed to execute a
perspective study on Nuclear Terrorism for the next five years51; as
attempts by terrorist organizations to acquire nuclear weapons are very
real. This indicates that there is a strategy that prevails over history
and the surrounding circumstances, in addition to motives put forth by
radical organizations to accomplish nuclear capabilities, including:

2.1 Instigation

[[Terrorist leaders]{.mark} and extremist idelogues have [consistently
issued **fatwas**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[calling for]{.mark} the
**[acquisition]{.mark} and development [of nuclear capabilities,]{.mark}
[citing]{.mark} qualitative [religious
justifications]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including but not limited to:

In 1998, **[Osama [bin Laden]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[issued a
fatwa]{.mark} that resembled a **major transition from ideology to
reality**. He considered the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction
to be a **religious obligation**]{.underline}52. The fatwa was founded
on baseless arguments, and misutilized religious texts and ideas in
order to gain legitimacy. In the same year that bin Laden planned the
September 11 terrorist attacks53, Al-Qaeda members in their camps at
Afghanistan found the means to acquire a nuclear bomb, in relatively
small amounts of high-enriched uranium, or plutonium, the size of an
orang or grapefruit.

In 1999, [bin Laden reissued his fatwa in an interview with an
**American magazine**]{.underline}54. Despite the start of the War on
Terror after the September 11th attacks, terrorist organizations have
not stopped seeking to acquire nuclear weapons55, as can be seen by
Al-Zawahiri's reuse of bin Laden's fatwa in 200856, and his
justification of nuclear attacks as a religious obligation - even if
they killed women, children, the elderly, and any other civilians -- on
the grounds of necessity and deterrence. Prior to his killing in 2011,
Anwar al-Awlaki, leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, wrote an article that was
published in the group's Inspire magazine, through which he called for
developing and deploying biological weapons, and to use them against
population centers, in an attempt to terrorize states that combat the
terrorism of the organization57:

2.2 Shock and Awe

Terrorist organizations in the world have a deeply polarized world view
where only they possess the absolute truth and therefore have to fight
everyone else58. [Violent terrorist strategy]{.underline},
[is]{.underline} therefore, [[closely linked to a **media** strategy
that uses **propaganda** to **diminish the other**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Efforts to acquire or develop nuclear weapons are **no
different**]{.underline} [and can be **[explained as a "policy of
destructive coercion",]{.mark}**]{.underline} [practiced as a desperate
attempt to enforce its terrorist expansion in different areas, under the
pretext of practicing propagandist behaviors.]{.underline}

It is clear that [terrorist organizations haven't, **until now**, used
nuclear weapons. However, [the **announcement by terrorist organizations
of**]{.mark} **their [desire to acquire]{.mark} those
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is an example of]{.mark} their
["shock and awe" strategy]{.mark}59]{.underline} [they have adopted as
[a form of **psychological** warfare]{.mark} that is **[designed to
strike fear]{.mark} in others**]{.underline}; whether [by committing
bloody massacres, broadcasting horrifying videos, or through the use of
non-traditional means in terrorist operations, such as the biological
attacks perpetrated by ISIS in Syria and in Iraq]{.underline}, [to
[**terrorize** people in order to]{.mark} **facilitate
[control]{.mark}ling [them]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **[deter them]{.mark} from [attacking the
organization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Prior to these operations were the
September 11th attacks that expressed the bloody desire of terrorism,
and confirmed that theoretical probabilities of terrorist behavior could
transform into a real danger, even if they at some point were limited to
intimidation60.

#### Tons of motives. 

Gary **Ackerman 18**, Associate Professor with the College of Emergency
Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity at SUNY Albany,
"Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Terrorism",
Routledge Handbook of Terrorism and Counterterrorism, Routledge

Motivation The standard formula for understanding a threat like CBRN
terrorism is to examine the intent that an adversary might have for
employing these weapons, relative to the capability it possesses for
doing so. Recognizing that these overarching factors are not completely
independent, one can begin by exploring the various motives that might
underlie a terrorist's decision to pursue CBRN weapons. Several
comprehensive articulations for why terrorists might seek CBRN weapons
have been undertaken elsewhere (for example, Gurr and Cole 2002; Bale
and Ackerman 2009; Gressang 2001); thus [it suffices to
consider]{.underline} these [motives under three broad
categories.]{.underline}

[First, [there are the **operational** and **instrumental**
motives]{.mark}. The most common of these in popular discourse is the
potential for **CBRN weapons**, when used as **[WMDs]{.mark}**, to
[cause **massive**]{.mark}]{.underline} numbers of [**casualties**.
[For]{.mark} terrorists [seeking]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[revenge]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}]{.mark} pursuing other
**[[punitive goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** against an entire population,
[CBRN weapons would be one means of achieving large-scale injury and
death. Indeed, for those seeking to inflict truly catastrophic levels of
casualties, numbering in the tens or hundreds of thousands,]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[high-end
bio]{.underline}**logical **[weapons]{.underline}** [are among
the]{.underline} **[few viable options]{.underline}**. Yet, terrorists
rarely pursue mass murder on such cataclysmic scales; they are usually
far more interested in using violence and the spectacle thereof to
intimidate their enemies. We have already established that CBRN weapons,
by their very nature, exert a disproportionate psychological impact.
Irrespective of the scale of their physical effects, they are thus
eminently suitable as weapons of terrorism per se, which is likely to be
a key driver in terrorist decisions to utilize them. In this respect,
governments, the media and other public voices can paradoxically play a
role in stimulating terrorist decisions to pursue CBRN weapons. Indeed,
A1 Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri has stated that the genesis of
Al-Qaeda's biological weapons exploits was the immense coverage in the
West (as illustrated by Secretary Cohen's antics described above) such
weapons received in the mid-1990s (Al-Zawahiri 1999): "Despite their
extreme danger, we only became aware of them \[biological weapons\] when
the enemy drew our attention to them by repeatedly expressing concerns
that they can be produced simply with easily available materials."

[A unique]{.underline} **[instrumental]{.underline}** [motive for
choosing CBRN weapons in particular is their ability to **[contaminate
vital locales]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and make them]{.underline}
**[unusable]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, thus [inflicting long-term
**economic**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[social
disruption.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [This aspect has not been lost on
terrorists]{.underline}, as seen in the following advice from a jihadist
who is well aware that radiological weapons are not suitable for causing
massive casualties (Al-Faqir 2005):

> The important thing is to disperse radioactive material in a large
> commercial area so the government is forced to shut down this area,
> which will cause this country massive economic disruption due to the
> following reasons:

• The high costs of decontamination of radioactive areas.

> • The high economic losses in this large commercial area due to
> closure.

• Subsequent unemployment and loss of jobs.

• Stoppage of general life in that area.

> • large compounded problems are to follow due to these losses.

[A further advantage is the [ability]{.mark} of at least biological and
radiological agents [to be used]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**covertly**,
with]{.mark} a significant **[lag time]{.mark}** between exposure to the
agent and when health effects become evident, thus **[allow]{.mark}**ing
the [perpetrators]{.mark} ample opportunity [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[escape]{.underline}**]{.mark} and perhaps even flee the country.
[Last, there are more]{.underline} **[strategic]{.underline}**
[motives]{.underline} for acquiring (or at least being perceived as
acquiring) CBRN weapons that do not even require that they be used.
First, [credible possession of a sizeable [CBRN]{.mark} weapon might
[serve as a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[deterrent]{.underline}**]{.mark}
against attack by counterterrorism forces. Second, [widespread knowledge
that a terrorist group possesses (or perhaps even that it is pursuing)
CBRN weapons [might provoke]{.mark} its **[government]{.mark}**
enemie**[s]{.mark}** [to **spend**]{.mark} exorbitant amounts of
**[money]{.mark}** on efforts [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[protect]{.mark} its [citizens]{.mark} from CBRN attack**, thus
[furthering]{.mark} a strategy of **[economic attrition]{.mark}**, or as
terrorist strategists have put it,]{.underline} **["death by a thousand
cuts"]{.underline}** (Cole 2010).

[The second category are psychological or ideological
stimuli]{.underline}, which can take a variety of forms, but tend to
favor CBRN weapons for reasons that are not objectively instrumental.
[Among the more frequently observed of these are the resonance of CBRN
weapons with certain ideological prophecies of cataclysm and the end
of]{.underline} days (Stern 1999). [Several religions contain references
to plagues, poisons or punishment by fire]{.underline}, for example the
Old Testament stories of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the
F.gyptian plagues or the New Testament allusions to apocalyptic
upheavals in the Book of Revelations. [To the extent that terrorists
adhere to such beliefs, CBRN weapons might take on a **legitimate or
even "sacred" role**. Moreover, the relatively bloodless (albeit no less
awful) effects of CBR agents and the instant incineration of the
immediate victims of a nuclear blast might be viewed as a
**"humane"**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **["purifying"
way]{.underline}** [to erase the old world and make way for the
new]{.underline}, along the lines of Robert Jay Lifton's "destroying the
world to save it" (Lifton 2000).

[Then there are those terrorist leaders or commanders who are drawn to
CBRN weapons for more]{.underline} **[solipsistic]{.underline}**
[reasons. The first of these is [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[fetishistic
relationship]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to either advanced technology in
general (i.e., when leaders are so-called 'techies') or CBRN weapons in
particular, which seems to [have been the case with]{.mark} the leader
of **[Aum Shinrikyo]{.mark}**, who wrote **odes to the nerve
agent**]{.underline} sarin. Not always entirely distinct from this is
the pursuit of CBRN for purposes of social status and self-glorification
by individuals who fancy themselves as masterminds and are intent on
displaying their technical prowess to both followers and enemies.

[The final category of terrorist motivations for pursuing CBRN weapons
are **organizational** motives. [One]{.mark} important set of
**[motive]{.mark}**s [entails]{.mark} a group version of the pursuit
of]{.underline} **[[prestige]{.underline}]{.mark}** described already,
although based on organizational concerns. When a terrorist group finds
itself in a rivalry with one or more other groups for the support of a
constituency, there can arise a pressure to intensify its attacks in
order to differentiate itself from its rivals (Bloom 2005); similarly,
an incumbent leader of a terrorist group might face a challenger within
his own group, with both parties having an incentive to escalate
tactically in order to elicit the support of the group membership. It
should be noted that tactical escalation can take many forms, however
one of the ways of gaining or maintaining status might be to show
oneself to be an innovator who is sufficiently bold and competent to
acquire CBRN weapons. [Tied to the idea of status and prestige, the
traditional association of CBRN weapons with advanced **state programs**
might make them attractive to terrorists who seek to establish
themselves]{.underline} (at least for their constituencies) [as
a]{.underline} **["world power"]{.underline}** on a par with their state
enemies.

[Last, some terrorist groups might pursue CBRN weapons simply because
they possess a]{.underline} **[surfeit of resources]{.underline}**
(Ackerman 2014, p. 78), akin to how a multinational corporation might
diversify its portfolio as an investment against future uncertainties.
While it is somewhat uncommon for terrorist groups to enjoy such freedom
of operation, there have been cases where a well-established group with
safe havens and a stable membership has established specific research
and development organs for the purpose of innovation in weapons and
tradecraft. [Examples include the Provisional Irish Republican Army,
Hezbollah and the FARC in Colombia.]{.underline}

In 2014, [Air Force Magazine published an article in which the

has **eclipsed land power** as the primary means of destroying enemy

general [contended ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY8KjKNIh24)that
American airpower]{.underline}---properly applied to achieve certain
effects---[could have quickly destroyed the Islamic State in Iraq and

Such [airpower advocacy does not just emanate from Air Force
circles]{.underline}. Retired US Army Gen. David [Petraeus
and]{.underline} Michael [O'Hanlon penned a 2016 op-ed, "[It's time to

and followed it up months later with another piece, "[Take the Gloves
Off Against the
Taliban](https://www.wsj.com/articles/take-the-gloves-off-against-the-taliban-1463783106),"
where they reinforce their call for a shift towards more airpower. [Such
arguments rest on rationalistic assumptions about a ground adversary
being willing to expose their foot soldiers, vehicles, and bases for
opportune aerial bombing]{.underline}. However, **[these expectations
miss the reality that [an enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[[and a **local
population**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[will **not acquiesce**]{.mark}
**solely**]{.underline} [[to the **application of kinetic
airpower**]{.underline}]{.mark} and a limited number of ground troops.
**[Larger numbers of [ground forces]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[are]{.underline} [needed]{.underline}]{.mark} [to maintain an **active
presence**]{.underline}---day and night---[if counterinsurgents are to
overcome the problem of **locals being intimidated**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[coerced by insurgents]{.underline}**. In fact, many
American troops will tell you that the Taliban prefer to stage attacks
on days with cloud cover or inclement weather, since Taliban fighters
know they can achieve near parity in a ground fight without concern that
an A-10, drone, or attack helicopter will show up to provide air cover
and deny their assault.

More broadly, [what many of these **airpower arguments** miss about the
**evolution of warfare**]{.underline}---especially since World War
II---[is that **[destruction accomplishes little.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**[Adversaries]{.underline}**]{.mark} [typically [find **alternative

**[exerting control]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[over

historical consistency, was made most cogently by T. R. Fehrenbach in
1963, when he
astutely [recognized](https://books.google.com/books?id=OJNxAAAAMAAJ&dq=But%2C+pushbutton+warfare+meant+Armageddon%2C+and+Armageddon%2C+hopefully%2C+will+never+be+an+end+of+national+policy.+Americans+in+1950+rediscovered+something+that+since+Hiroshima+they+had+forgotten%3A+you+may+fly+over+a+land+forever%3B+you+may+bomb+it%2C+atomize+it%2C+pulverize+it+and+wipe+it+clean+of+life%E2%80%94but+if+you+desire+to+defend+it%2C+protect+it+and+keep+it+for+civilization%2C+you+must+do+this+on+the+ground%2C+the+way+the+Roman+legions+did%2C+by+putting+your+young+men+in+the+mud.&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Americans+in+1950+rediscovered+something+that+since+Hiroshima+they+had+forgotten%3A+you+may+fly+over+a+land+forever%3B+you+may+bomb+it%2C+atomize+it%2C+pulverize+it+and+wipe+it+clean+of+life%E2%80%94but+if+you+desire+to+defend+it%2C+protect+it+and+keep+it+for+civilization%2C+you+must+do+this+on+the+ground%2C+the+way+the+Roman+legions+did%2C+by+putting+your+young+men+in+the+mud) a
fact of the US experience in the Korean War:

Americans in 1950 rediscovered something that since Hiroshima they had
forgotten: [[you may fly over a land forever]{.mark};]{.underline} [you
may bomb it]{.underline}, [atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean of
life]{.underline}---**[[but if you desire to defend
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[protect it]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[keep it]{.underline}** for civilization, [[you must
do this on the **ground**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the way the **Roman
legions did**]{.underline}, by putting your young men in the mud.

Such an airpower-centric mindset increasingly permeates American
strategy toward Afghanistan, as the US military struggles to maintain
control. In October 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis loosened the
rules of engagement in Afghanistan, to
include [removing ](https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2017/10/03/mattis-reveals-new-rules-of-engagement/)"restrictions
that did not allow \[the American military\] to employ the air power
fully." Unfortunately, such firepower-intensive rules of engagement have
not improved the security situation in Afghanistan. In fact, as of
September 2018, the Taliban now control or contest [about 60 percent of

Afghanistan, the largest [swath of
territory](https://www.longwarjournal.org/mapping-taliban-control-in-afghanistan) that
the Taliban have controlled since 2001. Taliban control will likely grow
even larger given
the [assassination ](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/20/taliban-won-key-battle-afghanistan-future-election-abdul-raziq/)of
Kandahar Police Chief Abdul Raziq, a strongman client that had been able
to provide some modicum of security on behalf of the United States. This
should leave us wondering: [[What is the future of]{.mark} American
military power and [effectiveness in dealing with]{.mark} not only
**fragile states** such as Afghanistan]{.underline}, [but also
**[conventional threats emanating from]{.mark} rising, [near-pear

[[airpower is an **oversold panacea**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} [[**[landpower]{.underline}** ]{.mark}](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a594671.pdf)(i.e.,

Operation Allied Force and the Gulf War Hangover

Operation Allied Force (OAF) is traditionally used by airpower
enthusiasts as the prime example of airpower deciding a conflict
independent of the other armed services. For many airpower planners,
the [effects-based
approach](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a515374.pdf) used to
decimate Iraqi centers of gravity in the Persian Gulf War justified a
similar method in trying to coerce and punish the Serbian government
for [atrocities ](https://books.google.com/books?id=p0gVDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serb+atrocities+in+Kosovo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjetrqmzLPeAhXxtlkKHb7kAX0Q6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&q=Serb%20atrocities%20in%20Kosovo&f=false)in
Kosovo. However, such **[weak induction]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[hasty generalizations]{.underline}** [by airpower enthusiasts
raise]{.underline} two [questions which they must answer, yet seldom
do.]{.underline}

[First]{.underline}, [if airpower won OAF alone, why did it take **so
long** to achieve a decisive victory?]{.underline} The typical response
to this question is that NATO-imposed restrictions limited the
effectiveness of the air campaign compared to the unleashed force that
characterized Desert Storm. The more logical argument is that [airpower
took so long]{.underline}, not due to self-imposed limitations, but
[because the **developed Serbian economy**]{.underline}, **[rough
terrain]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[foliage]{.underline}**,
[simply **limited airpower's lethality**]{.underline}. Serbian President
Slobodan
[Milošević [believed ](https://books.google.com/books?id=fu1QiZ1n5AgC&pg=PA335&dq=Milosevic+hunkered+down&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiphK3BoLHeAhVirlkKHeulDLEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Milosevic%20hunkered%20down&f=false)that
if he hunkered down, he could simply **outlast the
barrage.**]{.underline}

Next, [if the psychological implications of airpower can induce
capitulation, why did the slaughter of ethnic
Albanians [continue](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Iraq_Wars_and_America_s_Military_Rev.html?id=0J3q-vpyrDkC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=mcpeak's%20warning&f=false)]{.underline}---with
the genocidal rate actually increasing---[for seventy-eight days after
the initial strikes took place?]{.underline} In this case,
**[US]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[NATO bombings]{.underline}**
[only]{.underline} **[strengthened Milošević's resolve]{.underline}**
[and that of his **army**.]{.underline}

Interpretations of OAF and the conflict's resolution reveal a
fascinating dichotomy, which largely predicts how one views airpower
more generally. Traditionalists would say that airpower forced
Milošević's hand; yet the threat dynamics of a US/NATO [ground
invasion](https://books.google.com/books?id=0J3q-vpyrDkC&pg=PA125&dq=Milosevic+nato+ground+invasion+threat&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwic6sjtoLHeAhUCx1kKHV8ZBpoQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q=Milosevic%20nato%20ground%20invasion%20threat&f=false) carried
the day and finally forced him (and the Serbian army) to capitulate and
withdraw. Much like [Saddam
Hussein](https://books.google.com/books?id=Klzc6NpfKCMC&dq=saddam+miscalculated+persian+gulf+war&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=glaspie) during
the Persian Gulf War, Milošević made
political [calculations ](https://books.google.com/books?id=MyJKGq26ZjAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Serbian+government+for+atrocities+in+Kosovo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGmP3Ey7PeAhUiwFkKHYgQBMoQ6AEIQzAE#v=onepage&q=leverage&f=false)about
the resolve of the United States (and her allies) to commit to the
riskier use of ground forces (i.e., landpower).

[The Kosovo conflict]{.underline} provided many airpower traditionalists
the fodder needed to push airpower narratives of an offensive capability
that would transform warfare toward a future absent of land occupation.
However, the conflict instead [**illustrates the self-defeating
strategic intent of [airpower]{.mark}**. Its "**[effects]{.mark}**" [are
**so successful** and **low-risk that**, **by its very nature**, it
leads to a **seductive illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[that]{.underline} **[landpower is not
necessary]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[That]{.mark} illusion]{.underline},
however, **[[fails to comprehend]{.mark} the dynamic nature of
[adversarial decision making]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and ability to
easily **adapt** to **airpower-centric coercion**]{.underline}. [Since
landpower requires [**engagement** and
**commitment**](https://mwi.usma.edu/201425simplifying-strategic-concepts-thinking-about-what-landpower-seapower-airpower-and-the-marines-ought-to-do/)]{.underline},
[political and military leadership need to create the
**necessary **[**willpower** ](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2017/11/5/the-death-of-american-conventional-warfare-its-the-political-willpower-stupid)to
support landpower objectives]{.underline}. Such purposes can range from
attrition to establishing territorial control, all of which should
support strategic level goals.

Airpower Enables, but Landpower with a Strategy is Vital

Strategic effectiveness on the modern battlefield in the twenty-first
century is centered on the reality that
airpower needs [landpower ](https://mwi.usma.edu/2014512defining-and-conceptualizing-strategic-landpower/)to
be strategically relevant. Landpower, by contrast, merely desires
airpower because it makes both offensive and defensive maneuvers less
risky by degrading and disrupting adversarial ground forces. There is a
co-dependence between the two, but it is unequal. That fact is perhaps
threatening to some advocates of airpower, but it need not be.
Airpower's decisiveness might be in question---domination in the air
domain does not equal domination in the ground domain---but
its relevance is unequivocally not. Both the kinetic effects and
non-kinetic capabilities afforded by airpower can favorably shape
battlefield outcomes for landpower.

[[Against **near-peer state adversaries**]{.underline}, [airpower
provides]{.underline}]{.mark} [tremendous [kinetic
power]{.mark}]{.underline} against fixed targets.
[**[However]{.underline}**, [due to]{.underline}]{.mark} [contemporary
understandings of **[international law]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and what
are legal targets), [[adversaries **rarely allow** the United States to
**target critical assets**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[and the United States
and her allies generally **refrain from purposely inflicting collateral
damage**]{.underline}. For instance, [during the Vietnam
War]{.underline}, [the State Department regularly informed North
Vietnamese leadership what targets were going to be bombed by the US
military so as to avoid civilian casualties]{.underline}. **[[The most
airpower can provide]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the sphere of military
operations against adversarial states [is]{.mark} primarily
**[non-kinetic effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}---things like ISR
(intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) and C2 (command and
control) capabilities. **[Moreover]{.underline}**, [with
the [development ](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00249)of
**A2/AD**]{.underline} (antiaccess and area denial) [weapon systems by
potentially **adversarial states**]{.underline} [to **detect stealth
aircraft** and launch accurate, long-range
surface-to-air-missiles]{.underline}, [the prospect of American airpower
achieving **nothing more than air parity**]{.underline} [in certain
regions is close to being a **reality**.]{.underline}

In regard to non-state actors, **[ground forces]{.underline}** [still
have to deal with the
same [dynamics ](https://books.google.com/books/about/Civil_Wars.html?id=C8wCDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=widespread%20and%20destrutive&f=false)seen

nearly two millennia ago. [[There are local-level politics that **no

[There might be competition between pro-government soldiers and
anti-government fighters]{.underline} taking place seemingly on every
street corner and in every neighborhood---[and this is the dynamic
environment in which both sides are vying for control while the local
population tries to hedge its bets]{.underline}, simply seeking
survival. In this precarious situation, [the armed force that
eventually [gains
control](https://books.google.com/books?id=jaTUJZlOykkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=kalyvas+logic&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOg4S44areAhXs64MKHZNeAGQQuwUIKzAA#v=snippet&q=information%20violence&f=false) does
so because of its ability to **better collect
intelligence**]{.underline} (especially through collaborators and
defectors) [and **discriminately** kill adversarial forces]{.underline}
(and their supporters and sympathizers). Even attempts to use
technology, such as mechanized formation or armored vehicles to protect
counterinsurgent forces in such a situation, [reduces the
ability](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/7D087F93A59E7D15931576039C0641BF/S0020818309090031a.pdf/rage-against-the-machines-explaining-outcomes-in-counterinsurgency-wars.pdf) of
counterinsurgents to collect accurate, detailed, and nuanced
intelligence, thereby degrading their ability to selectively target and
fight insurgents among the population.

The fact that there has been so much American military investment in and
emphasis
on [building ](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/02/07/training-wreck/)the
Afghan Air Force with little to show in terms of Afghan combat
effectiveness against the Taliban is not an indictment of the Afghan
military forces. It is a reflection of a strategic delusion, an
illustration of what the United States values in the war effort in
Afghanistan---and what the Afghan military is actually capable of. The
first [deployment ](https://www.stripes.com/news/with-1st-sfab-deployed-army-looks-to-build-more-adviser-brigades-1.519734)of
a security force assistance brigade to Afghanistan in early 2018---with
the specific intent to develop an effective Afghan National
Army---might help the war American war effort to overcome the [three
common
traps](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326534224_Getting_American_Security_Force_Assistance_Right_Political_Context_Matters_Forthcoming_in_Joint_Forces_Quarterly) of
security force assistance missions (politicized, unaffordable, and
threatening) in fragile states. There is a moral hazard involved with
training and supporting host-nation armies in weak states, because this
can lead to a dependency on American firepower without resolving
domestic political issues and civil-military relations problems that
prevent the host-nation military from being effective and sustainable in
the long term. Thus, airpower and landpower need to be further
re-conceptualized around the idea of how American military power can be
utilized in these two domains. Understanding which explicit effects can
be obtained through each is vital in supporting long-term strategic
interests, such as nation-and-state building in fragile states (e.g.,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, etc.). Otherwise even air- and landpower
effects together become, at best, part of attritional wars that amount
to nothing more than a game
of [whack-a-mole](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2014.935229).

Conclusion: Airpower Needs to Enable Ground Forces

Airpower is inherently an enabling force. Airpower advocates have long
argued that it can generate strategic effects absent landpower. As with
many contentions, this is correct if the context is set tightly. More
importantly, non-kinetic airpower (e.g., intelligence and signals
collection) provides tremendous value to all military branches and
allies seeking to target important nodes in criminal, insurgent, or
terrorist networks and also against adversarial states.

OAF represents the most recent example of airpower failing to achieve
the desired effects of capitulation from an adversarial state with a
developed infrastructure and economy. Only under the perceived threat of
a ground invasion did Milošević finally conclude that his efforts would
fail. Ultimately, there is an indisputable feature of [survival
concerns](https://books.google.com/books?id=TjmpCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=phil+haun+air+power+coercion&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi60rGKz7PeAhXrx1kKHUBLDhUQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=survival%20concerns&f=false) seen
in most weak state contexts, where coercion throughout all the domains
is the surest way to achieve strategic goals.

There is inherent virtue in advocating for greater "jointness" between
all branches in all the different domains, especially given the current
strategic context---the United States having been sobered by the
elusiveness of clear-cut victories in Iraq and Afghanistan and the
post--Cold War "unipolar moment" seemingly over as the United States
faces a revanchist Russia and the continued rise of China. But separate
from this, there is a simple truth: airpower ultimately needs landpower
to remain strategically important. Landpower can operate without
airpower, if ground commanders can accept a higher level of risk.
Airpower without landpower or strategic purpose is just [bombing to
win](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xHZnTAPQFc8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=bombing+to+win&ots=IKZZADoIiZ&sig=OWsJoSYfbNgGxEDNSNnIc69kwhs#v=onepage&q=bombing%20to%20win&f=false), without
actually winning.

Luckily, American and allied ground forces have been able to
operate---for decades---under the presumption of the air domain being
dominated by friendly forces achieving and maintaining air supremacy.
The more complicated aspect of this relationship has been trying to
convert tactical victories in the short term into successes at the
strategic level in the long term. [Perhaps]{.underline}

**[cannot]{.underline}** [substitute for sound policy]{.underline}."

While there might be some merit to [discussions about relying on
[airpower]{.mark} to achieve certain effects]{.underline} to defeat
adversaries, such as the Islamic State, this [**[short-circuits the
primary center of gravity]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [most
[underdeveloped countries: **state formation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If
one takes a **long view of history**]{.underline}, [then it might have
been **strategically wise**]{.underline}---in terms of state-building
objectives---[that the US military reluctantly engaged in a **minimalist
fashion**]{.underline} (i.e., with advisers, fire support, air support,
etc.) [in supporting the Iraqi Army against the Islamic
State]{.underline}. The reluctant American approach forced politicians
in Baghdad to move beyond their corrupt survival strategies (e.g.,
patronage, coup-proofing, etc.), thereby allowing Iraqi military forces
to operate with maximum combat effectiveness. Thus, numerous domestic
political issues that had fueled Sunni grievances, which begat Islamic
State momentum in the first place, were resolved by the existential
threat [posed ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/isis-within-8-miles-of-baghdad-airport-and-armed-with-manpads/)by
Islamic State fighters getting within eight miles of the Baghdad Airport
in October 2014.

[[Airpower]{.underline} **[cannot resolve]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the
[political dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.underline}
**[distort state building]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[presence of ground troops can]{.mark} serve as a third-party
enforcement mechanism**]{.underline} [when political relations **break
down** between various factions.]{.underline} Much like the NATO-led
peacekeeping force in Kosovo has maintained a sizeable presence of
troops in Kosovo [since
1999](https://www.army.mil/article/201778/jmrc_prepares_units_for_kosovo_mission),
perhaps American policymakers need to accept a similar strategy in Iraq.
Deploying a similar type of US-led international peacekeeping force in
Iraq might be needed for several decades so as to prevent future Iraqi
political factionalism and military fragmentation. A long-term
engagement could institutionalize trust between various factions in the
Iraqi government and security organizations, allowing the US military to
eventually pull out without worrying about the Iraqi government or
military collapsing.

Thus, [[while many will keep arguing]{.mark} for the **unleashing of
[airpower]{.mark}** to maximize combat effectiveness]{.underline},
**[[we should be wary]{.mark} of such suggestions]{.underline}**. [[We
need to ask **tougher**]{.mark} **[questions]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} how airpower will support [**[landpower

[Mention "failed states" in an academic seminar]{.underline} or a policy
meeting [and you will hear a laundry list of tragic
problems]{.underline}: poverty, disease, famine, refugees flowing across
borders and more. If it is a really gloomy day, you will hear that
failed states are associated with terrorism, ethnic cleansing and
genocide. This is the conventional wisdom that has developed over the
past two decades, and rightly so given the scale of the human tragedies
in Bosnia, Somalia and Rwanda, just to mention the most egregious cases
of the 1990s.

[This]{.underline} **[prevailing view]{.underline}** [of failed states,
however, though true, is also **incomplete**]{.underline}. [[Failed
states are]{.mark} not only a source of **domestic**

more traditional view of state failure is less prevalent these days, for
only recently has the prospect of great power competition over failed
"vacuum" states returned. But, clearly, recent events in Georgia---as
well as possible future scenarios in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, as
well as southeastern Europe, Asia and parts of Africa---suggest that it
might be a good time to adjust, really to expand, the way we think about
"failed states" and the kinds of problems they can cause.

**[[The Problem of Failed States]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Even a cursory look at the vital signs of our current world order lends
unwelcome support to my conclusion. And those of us in the environmental
field are well into our third decade of charting trends of environmental
decline without seeing any significant effort to reverse a single one.

In six of the past nine years world grain production has fallen short of
consumption, forcing a steady drawdown in stocks. When the 2008 harvest
began, world carryover stocks of grain (the amount in the bin when the
new harvest begins) were at 62 days of consumption, a near record low.
In response, world grain prices in the spring and summer of last year
climbed to the highest level ever.

As demand for food rises faster than supplies are growing, the resulting
food-price inflation puts severe stress on the governments of countries
already teetering on the edge of chaos. Unable to buy grain or grow
their own, hungry people take to the streets. Indeed, even before the
steep climb in grain prices in 2008, the number of failing states was
expanding \[see sidebar at left\]. Many of their problem\'s stem from a
failure to slow the growth of their populations. But if the food
situation continues to deteriorate, **[[entire nations will break down
at an ever increasing rate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We have entered a new
era in geopolitics. **[[In the 20th century the main threat]{.mark} to
international security [was superpower conflict; today it is failing
states.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is not the concentration of power but
its absence that puts us at risk.

[States fail when national governments can no longer
provide]{.underline} [personal security, food security and basic social
services]{.underline} such as education and health care.
[They]{.underline} often [lose control of part or all of their
territory.]{.underline} [When governments lose their monopoly on power,
**law and order begin to disintegrate**]{.underline}. After a point,
countries can become so dangerous that food relief workers are no longer
safe and their programs are halted; in Somalia and Afghanistan,
deteriorating conditions have already put such programs in jeopardy.

[[Failing states **are of international concern**]{.mark} because [they
are a source of **terrorists**, **drugs**, **weapons** and **refugees**,
threatening **political stability everywhere**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Somalia, number one on the 2008 list of failing states, has become a
base for piracy. Iraq, number five, is a hotbed for terrorist training.
Afghanistan, number seven, is the world\'s leading supplier of heroin.
Following the massive genocide of 1994 in Rwanda, refugees from that
troubled state, thousands of armed soldiers among them, helped to
destabilize neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (number six).

[Our [**global civilization** depends on a **functioning network
of**]{.mark} **politically [healthy nation-states]{.mark}** [to
control]{.mark} the spread of infectious **[disease]{.mark}**, to manage
the international monetary system, to control international
[**terrorism** and]{.mark} to reach [**scores of other common goals**.
If the system]{.mark} for controlling infectious
diseases]{.underline}\--such as polio, SARS or avian flu\--[**[breaks

assumes responsibility for their debt to outside lenders. If enough
states disintegrate, [**their fall will threaten the stability of global

### Airpower Bad\-\--Failed States\-\--Impact\-\--AT: No Scenario

**[Such is the way of hegemony]{.underline}**, argues Porter.
Rule-makers aren't generally rule-takers. Porter, a realist in the
classical tradition, is untroubled by this. What bothers him is the
"false promise" that hegemony can be benevolent---a delusion, he
believes, that warps the world view of [U.S. leaders]{.underline}. From
their perspective, the international order created in 1945 has been a
blessing. They [have]{.underline} thus [struggled to understand why
foreigners might not be content or might perceive U.S. policing as a
threat]{.underline}. Puffed up on their own hype, policymakers in
Washington have been repeatedly "shocked" when their "obviously benign
actions result in resistance," Porter writes. Seeing themselves as pure,
they can explain opposition only by seeing the world as wicked: a
sinkhole teeming with thugs, bad guys, and ever-duplicitous Pakistanis.
"You know why they hate us?" George W. Bush asked after Al Qaeda's
attacks on September 11, 2001. "They hate us because we love freedom."

[Such a world view **leads easily**]{.underline} [to the conclusion that
**[Something Must Be Done]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Bush started Middle
Eastern wars in the name of freedom]{.underline}---[wars
that]{.underline}, in different forms, **[Obama]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Trump continued]{.underline}**. The titles of the
military missions read like tombstones in a graveyard of liberal
ambitions: [Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom,
Operation Freedom's Sentinel, Operation New Dawn. We're now at Operation
Inherent Resolve]{.underline}, the ongoing mission to extirpate the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It's the first one whose name makes no
reference to freedom or transformation, yet [it would be **optimistic**
to **interpret this as a backing down**]{.underline}. [[Recent years
have shown **Washington's military commitments** to be **wedged
tightly**]{.mark} **[in place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This past
September, [on the same day that Trump declared "we are out of Syria"
other than to guard its oil fields, the Pentagon announced that it was
increasing troop levels by twenty per cent.]{.underline}

"[[You guys want me to **send troops everywhere**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
[[Trump]{.mark} reportedly [complained]{.mark}]{.underline} to his top
national-security aides as they proposed more force in North Africa.
"**[[Unfortunately, sir]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [Secretary of Defense
Jim [Mattis replied]{.mark}]{.underline}, "**[[you have no
choice]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[Does the United States, in the end, have a choice?]{.underline} **[Not
really]{.underline}**, writes Gates. With U.S. primacy, the world is a
place where differences can be resolved peaceably. [Without it, the
planet "descends into a **dog-eat-dog**]{.underline},
**[might-makes-right]{.underline}** [environment]{.underline}." **[[The
question]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Gates [[is **not whether the United
States should reign but how it should do so**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
A defter hand, he hopes, will restore the country to its necessary role.
This restoration would, as Biden has put it, "place America back at the
head of the table."

Porter has different advice: abandon the seat. The U.S.-centered system
was built at the end of the Second World War, when the U.S. economy was
larger than the four next-largest economies combined. Today, by some
measures, it is smaller than China's. The crisis of U.S. supremacy has
been in the making for decades, though Porter thinks that it has now
reached its culmination. For the United States to hang onto its
increasingly untenable position would only leave it "a militarized,
overextended empire in a permanent state of alarm," perpetually
threatening the peace it claims to protect. A better course for the
obsolescent hegemon, Porter proposes, would be to "decline gracefully."

What might a [graceful decline]{.underline} look like? It [would require
Washington to give up the notion that its troops or its values should
dominate the planet]{.underline}. This wouldn't mean retreating from
worldly affairs, just adjusting to a more level international field.
Relieved of having to frantically defend its leadership, Porter notes,
the United States could focus, as it had before the Second World War, on
the more achievable goals of protecting itself from physical attack and
defending its republican institutions.

Both tasks would be easier with a smaller military. It's hard to be a
calm and secure republic with armed forces stationed everywhere,
stirring up resistance. A dethroned Washington would still need to
maneuver against powerful rivals---Porter recommends that the United
States contain China and block it from forming a strong alliance with
Russia. Yet it would no longer have to compulsively monitor the map for
threats to its primacy.

**[[Relinquishing]{.mark} that [primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[giving
up the seat at the head of the table]{.underline}---**[[is about as
palatable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to U.S. policymakers [as **defunding
police departments**]{.mark}. It's not just that the position is
**unpopular**]{.underline} among them; [it's that]{.underline}, until
recently, [it was]{.underline} in many circles
**[unthinkable]{.underline}**. But is that because the idea is so
horrendously bad that it would quickly trigger global catastrophe, as
Gates believes? Or is U.S. hegemony yet another relic from a bygone era,
long overdue for reappraisal?

THE ROAD TO PERDITION

[If I had to reduce these tenets to a **single maxim**, it would be
this: **[All the happy talk about]{.mark} the [techno-wonders of modern
airpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[obscures its]{.mark} **darker
facets**]{.underline}, [especially its [ability to **lock America into
what are effectively one-way wars with dead-end
results.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

For this reason, [precision warfare is truly an
**oxymoron**]{.underline}. [War isn't precise]{.underline}. [It's nasty,
bloody, and murderous]{.underline}. [War's]{.underline} **[inherent
nature]{.underline}**---its unpredictability, horrors, and tendency to
outlast its original causes and goals---[isn't changed when the bombs
and missiles are guided by GPS]{.underline}. [Washington's enemies in
its war on terrorism]{.underline}, moreover, **[have learned to adapt to
airpower]{.underline}** [in a grimly **Darwinian fashion**]{.underline}
[and have the advantage of fighting on their own turf.]{.underline}

Who doesn't know the old question about if a tree falls in the forest
and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Here's a
21st-century airpower variant on it: If foreign children die from
American bombs but no US media outlets report their deaths, will anyone
grieve? Far too often, the answer here in the United States is no, and
so our wars go on into an endless future of global destruction.

### Economy\-\--SMRs Worse\-\--1NC

#### SMR's are [bad for the Economy]{.underline} and [too slow to solve climate change]{.underline}. UAMPS's failed project proves.

small modular nuclear reactors", Utility Dive,

1-31-2024). Accessed 7-6-2025 by NT-RM.

[This past November]{.underline}, the Utah Associated Municipal Power
Systems, or [**UAMPS, terminated** what was to be "the **first NuScale
Power s**mall **m**odular **r**eactor plant to begin operation in the
United States]{.underline}." [This was a **death
foretold**]{.underline}; [the **red flags** have been obvious for
years]{.underline} now. Although there were problems specific to that
project, [the **financial challenges** and **cost trends**
witnessed]{.underline} in this case [will afflict any small modular
nuclear reactor project. In a rational world, **no utility or government
would invest another dime** on these theoretical reactor
concepts.]{.underline}

As announced in 2015[, the UAMPS project initially involved constructing
12 reactor modules capable of generating 600 MW, with the aim
of]{.underline} starting operations "around 2023," and at [an "overnight
cost" of \$3 billion. In 2018, NuScale announced a design modification
with each module now producing 60 MW of electricity,]{.underline} or 720
MW for the whole plant, claiming this would lower the cost "on a per
kilowatt basis from an expected \$5,000 to approximately \$4,200."

[The estimated costs of the project **rose to \$4.2 billion** in 2018,
**then \$6.1 billion** in 2020, and **finally \$9.3 billion** in
2023,]{.underline} after it was scaled down to 462 MW in 2021. [In the
end, the **costs were clearly too high** for UAMPS members to
bear]{.underline}.

[The engineers and accountants on the project were **evidently
unrealistic** about the likely costs]{.underline}, or perhaps NuScale
preferred to gently break the bad news about how immense the bill would
be. Or both. NuScale also managed to retain members by claiming an
unreasonably low cost of power from the project once operational, a cost
derived using an opaque economic methodology without clarity over its
assumptions. [There is a lesson here: one just **cannot trust initial
cost estimates for nuclear reactors** and their
electricity]{.underline}.

[The UAMPS project is no exception, and just **adds one more data
point** to a **long history of cost** and **time overruns** for nuclear
power projects]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} 2014 [academic study
examined 180 nuclear power projects around the world and found **175 of
them exceeded the initial budget** by an average of **117%** by the time
they were completed. They also took]{.underline}, on average**[, 64%
longer than projected.]{.underline}**

[More recent projects have **fared worse**]{.underline}. For example,
the only reactor being constructed in France --- the poster child for
nuclear energy --- is Flamanville 3 with an estimated cost of 13.2
billion euros (around \$15 billion) --- four times the forecast when
construction started. The time anticipated has gone from 4.5 years
initially to over 16 years.

[These **high costs translate to expensive electricity**. In April
2023]{.underline}, Lazard, [a financial firm, estimated that the
unsubsidized levelized cost of electricity from new nuclear plants in
the U.S. will be]{.underline} between \$141 and [**\$221** per megawatt
hour. By comparison, a newly constructed **utility-scale solar
facility** with some storage to provide power after the sun sets will
produce power at an unsubsidized levelized cost of]{.underline} between
**[\$46]{.underline}** and \$102 [per megawatt hour,]{.underline}
according to Lazard. [Costs for these technologies have been trending in
opposite directions: **nuclear is going up** whereas **solar** and
**batteries have become cheaper** and are expected to decline
further.]{.underline}

[Small modular reactors are at an **economic
disadvantage**]{.underline}. [The lower power output of these reactors,
**less than 300 MW per unit**]{.underline} by definition as compared to
the roughly 1,000 MW for the typical reactors that have been constructed
for over four decades, [means **less revenue** for the owning utility.
But the **cost of construction** is not proportionately smaller.
Engineers call this economies of scale. In terms of cost per unit
(megawatt) of generation capacity, SMRs and the electricity they produce
will be **more expensive**]{.underline} than power from large nuclear
plants currently under construction. As the Lazard estimates show, these
large [plants are]{.underline} themselves **[not competitive with
renewables.]{.underline}**

The [lack of "economies of scale" is apparent for the UAMPS
project]{.underline}. Its [final cost was]{.underline} around [**250%
more** than the initial per megawatt cost for the 2,200 MW Vogtle
project in Georgia]{.underline}. But [the phenomenon of **higher costs
for s**mall **r**eactors is general, and will **plague all SMR
proposals**]{.underline}. On a per megawatt basis, the estimated cost of
the CAREM-25 SMR project being built in Argentina is estimated to be
between \$17 million to \$24 million, in the same ballpark as the UAMPS
project. [Historically]{.underline}, too, [most of the early small
reactors built in the United States **shut down** because of adverse
economics]{.underline}.

Nuclear energy advocates point to the variable nature of renewables and
argue that some form of nuclear power is necessary to keep the power
system reliable. [But grids have always had to deal with variable
supply, including from supposedly reliable sources of power: nuclear
plants have to be **shut down unexpectedly** for safety
reasons]{.underline} (for example, Japan's plants after the Fukushima
disaster) and coal plants might not operate because their fuel supply is
interrupted, for example, by the derailment of a train. [Every French
nuclear plant was, on average, shut down for **96.2 days**, **115.4
days**, **103.8 days**, and **152** days in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022,
respectively.]{.underline}

The variability of modern renewables can be addressed by a combination
of increasing diversity in technologies and in geographical locations,
providing incentives to consumers to shift their electricity use to
periods when renewable energy is plentiful, and finally expanding
investments into multiple forms of energy storage, from lithium-ion
batteries to pumped storage of water. But even prior to all that is
encouraging more efficient use of energy. This also helps address
variability because, for example, a building that gains or loses heat
more slowly can remain comfortable for longer periods of time, even
during periods of reduced electricity supply. [Nuclear plants are **not
needed** to compensate for the periods when the sun is not shining or
the wind is not blowing.]{.underline}

All of this also means that [nuclear power is not needed to solve the
climate crisis. Not only are nuclear reactors **very expensive**, they
also take a **very long time to build**. And this is **time we don't
have** because the climate crisis is **urgent**.]{.underline}

When announcing the end of the [UAMPS project, NuScale's Chief Executive
Officer said]{.underline} on a conference call: ["Once **you're on a
dead horse**, you dismount quickly. That's where we are here." The dead
horse, in reality, **is all the SMR projects**. The sooner we get off
this misguided quest, the more we can **focus on rationally dealing with
our energy and climate challenges**]{.underline}.

Adding insult to injury, EV owners alone aren't shouldering these
increased electricity costs, which average \$11,833 per vehicle over 10
years. Until a utility starts charging EV owners for the extra
infrastructure costs to serve them, those costs are shared among all the
utility's customers. Residential electricity costs across the U.S. have
risen 20% over the last three years, and a rapid forced adoption of EVs
will only make this problem worse.

Direct federal and state subsidies provide EVs with another \$8,984 per
vehicle over 10 years, including the widely publicized \$7,500 federal
tax credit in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and smaller state
subsidies for EVs. All these subsidies, of course, are borne by the
American taxpayer.

President Biden's expensive green pipe dream is not without irony.

While Biden administration claims that these draconian EV mandates are
necessary to combat climate change, the widespread adoption of EVs in
the developed world would have negligible effects on global emissions
and climate. For starters, if EVs are able to displace all the carbon
emissions from U.S. passenger cars, that would only cut out 20% of U.S.
carbon emissions. Our calculations show that even if the U.S. eliminated
all of its carbon emissions by 2050, the effect on global temperatures
in 2100 would only be 0.08 degrees Celsius.

But EVs will not even get us that far because they don't cut carbon
emissions much---if at all---compared  to gasoline vehicles. As pointed
out by Mark Mills in a recent op-ed in Real Clear Energy, it is nearly
impossible to measure an individual EV's emissions. While driving an EV
itself does not directly produce emissions, the emissions to generate
the electricity used to charge EVs vary widely depending on location.

[[EV **batteries**]{.mark} also [require **fossil fuels** to
produce]{.mark}]{.underline}, and many components of EV batteries are
made in emissions-heavy China. The [[emissions]{.mark} resulting [from
**mining** and **processing**]{.mark} the materials]{.underline} used in
the battery are largely unreported, and the emissions during EV
production [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [be enough to
**[wipe out]{.mark}** the **[emissions saved]{.mark}** by not combusting
gasoline]{.underline}.

A recent study by Volvo attempts to quantify some of these factors, and
the result is not rosy for EVs. The lifetime emissions of the electric
version of the Volvo SUV at the center of the study are only a third
less than the emissions of the gasoline version, and that is when it is
charged on the carbon-light European grid. Different assumptions could
lead to an EV emitting more carbon than its gasoline counterpart. The
obvious conclusion is that without rapid reductions in carbon emissions
from the electric grid, an equally Herculean task to EV mass adoption,
EVs will continue to produce significant carbon emissions.

Emissions from gasoline vehicles are projected to decline 20% over the
next decade, and hybrids, which nearly double the fuel efficiency of a
gasoline vehicle with a battery that is 50-100 times smaller than an EV
battery, would actually produce the least amount of lifetime emissions.
But the net-zero advocates are needlessly demanding all EVs---or
nothing.

EVs would also have little impact on levels of actual pollution in U.S.
cities, like soot and smog, because the U.S. is already a world leader
in clean air. When the number of passenger cars on the road fell by half
during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was no
measurable impact on air quality in the U.S. Our air pollution levels
are so close their natural state that weather has a far greater impact
on pollution levels in most U.S. cities than the emissions from our
vehicles.

[The [reality is, **EVs** are **not going away**]{.mark} any time soon,
[but **neither** are **cars**]{.mark} in general. [Americans
are]{.mark}]{.underline} still **[[driving]{.underline}]{.mark}**
at nearly [[the **same rate**]{.mark} they were
[before]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19
pandemic---[more than [**3.2 trillion** miles]{.mark} total
**[annually]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even the addition of a few hundred
million [**[new EVs]{.mark}** over [the next
decade]{.mark}]{.underline}, up from 20 million today, [[will
**only account**]{.mark} for]{.underline} approximately 10-[[**20%**
of]{.mark} all]{.underline} passenger [[vehicles
**globally**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[GU1\] \[GU2\] \[3\]  Currently, 90%
of EVs in the U.S. are purchased as a second or third car, usually in
addition to a gasoline vehicle. If the U.S. were to adopt the
[Biden]{.underline} administration's preferred number [EVs,
[consumers]{.mark} would [have to **purchase** EVs]{.mark} at a

greater]{.underline}]{.mark} and faster [[than **any**]{.mark}

[[households **without a car** needs to rise]{.underline}]{.mark} from

right---[70%]{.mark} of people]{.underline} around the world [[must
**not** have a **car**]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet the global elite's

we enjoy [in the **U.S.** and in **Europe**]{.underline}, but net-zero
will require them to remain confined forever or to rely solely on
government-owned transit. Even the developed world will have to cut its
driving dramatically. In California, regulators predicted \[GU5\] that
the state's emissions goals will require Californians to both buy EVs
and reduce miles driven by 25%.

### Economy\-\--AT: Lithium Batteries\-\--1NC

#### No lithium shortages -- African Markets, Consumer Preferences, and Market Slowdown Solves

**Homes**, Andy 7-11-**24** Senior metals columnist who previously
covered industrial metals markets for Metals Week and was EMEA
commodities editor at Knight-Ridder (subsequently Bridge). Started up
Metals Insider in 2003 and sold it to Thomson Reuters in 2008, he is
author of 'Siberian Dreams' (2006) about the Russian Arctic (After
another boom and bust, where next for lithium? \| reuters. (n.d.).
https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/after-another-boom-bust-where-next-lithium-andy-home-2024-07-11/)

LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - [Lithium boom has turned to lithium bust
over the last two years as a wave of **new supply** overwhelms
**weaker-than-expected** demand for electric vehicle (EV)
batteries]{.underline}.

The CME contract for lithium hydroxide has collapsed from a 2022 high of
\$85,000 per metric ton to \$11,930. The CME carbonate contract was
above \$40,000 when it began trading in July 2023 and has since slumped
to \$12,850.

[Lithium has **been here before**. There was a similar boom-bust cycle
in 2016-2017 but the difference this time is that no-one seems to be
expecting a speedy recovery.]{.underline}

The [short-term outlook is for]{.underline} [prices to trundle along at
the lows as the market digests surplus material]{.underline}.

The longer-term picture is more positive as governments force the
transition to electric vehicles but there will be no return to the giddy
heights of 2022 in the next 10 years, according to analysts at BMI, a
Fitch Solutions company.

Don\'t be too quick to write off either lithium or the electric vehicle
sector, though. The current price bust has been exacerbated by one-offs
on both the supply and demand sides of the equation.

[TOO MUCH SUPPLY]{.underline}

Lithium producers view their product as a bespoke chemical tailored to
battery-makers\' tight specifications rather than as a generic
commodity.

[Yet lithium\'s price behaviour is that of any other commodity, periods
of **high pricing encouraging** over-production which must then be
weeded out by periods of low pricing.]{.underline}

That pattern is currently playing out as producers trim output and defer
expansion plans in reaction to the new much lower price reality.

One little-discussed element of the current glut, however, is the surge
in artisanal mining (ASM) in Africa, particularly in Nigeria and
Zimbabwe.

[Research house CRU estimates that artisanal miners accounted for almost
two-thirds of African lithium supply in 2023 with volumes nearly
equivalent to the global market surplus last year.]{.underline}

African shipments of ore and low-grade concentrates accounted for a
quarter of China\'s total lithium imports in the first quarter of this
year on a metal contained basis, according to CRU.

Chinese entities are heavily involved in formalising artisanal supply
which is centred on previous tin and tantalum mining areas.

However, ASM is particularly price sensitive. The current wave of
independent production began when the price of spodumene ore was still
above \$6,000 per ton at the start of 2023. It is now closer to \$1,000,
challenging the economic viability of all but the richest of deposits.

More formalisation may result but as the cobalt market has learnt, ASM
can be a very significant and very fast-moving swing component of the
overall supply picture.

[TOO LITTLE DEMAND]{.underline}

Compounding lithium\'s price weakness has been a downgrade in
expectations for EV sales as the Chinese market matures and the Western
market loses some of its recent momentum.

[The EV revolution has hit a **slow patch** but is far from going into
reverse.]{.underline} BNP Paribas, for example, is still expecting
global sales growth of 23% this year, equivalent to over 18.7 million
vehicles.

[What has changed, however, is the product mix. Sales of pure battery
vehicles are **flat-lining**, while sales of hybrid gas-electric
vehicles are booming, even in China.]{.underline}

[Chinese sales of plug-in hybrids jumped by 90% year-on-year in April
and May, while those of pure electric vehicles rose by a comparatively
modest 10%, according to BNP.]{.underline}

This may be good news for the broader energy transition but it\'s not so
good for lithium since many hybrids use a nickel hydride battery with no
lithium, the bank notes.

Hybrids, once viewed as a mere stepping stone on the journey from
internal combustion to fully electric engines are proving remarkably
popular with consumers worried about charging infrastructure and the
relatively high cost of pure battery vehicles.

Automakers are responding. Stellantis [(STLAM.MI), opens new
tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/STLAM.MI), which saw
hybrid sales grow by 41% year-on-year in Europe in the first half of the
year, plans [to
expand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-expand-hybrid-vehicle-line-meet-growing-demand-2024-07-09/) its
line of affordable hybrid vehicles to 36 models in Europe by 2026.

So too are governments. [The Joe Biden administration has [rowed
back](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/plug-in-polluters-how-bidens-emissions-rules-go-soft-hybrid-trucks-suvs-2024-06-06/) on
its target of converting two-thirds of new vehicles to battery electric
vehicles by 2032, allowing auto-makers to step up production of hybrids
instead.]{.underline}

[FULL CHARGE AHEAD]{.underline}

[The automotive energy transition is still in full swing but is not
matching the exuberant forecasts made a couple of years
ago.]{.underline}

There is now too much lithium supply and too much battery capacity
relative to consumer demand for electric vehicles.

The slowdown could easily reverse.

[One critical facilitator will be the build-out of EV **charging
infrastructure**, a sector which has attracted **far less investment**
than battery manufacturing.]{.underline}

Car buyers in Europe and the United States are choosing hybrids because
of range anxiety and they will continue to do so until they see more
charging points.

[The second key factor is price, with electric vehicles **still more
expensive** than traditional cars everywhere outside of
China.]{.underline}

[Just as high lithium prices were]{.underline} [good news for
**producers** but not **battery-makers**]{.underline}, current low
prices are bad news for the lithium sector but very good news for
consumers in the form of lower battery prices.

[Lithium-ion battery packs registered a 7% increase in price between
2021 and 2022, breaking a long-running downtrend, according to the
International Energy Agency. High lithium prices were matched by bull
markets in other battery inputs such as cobalt, nickel and
graphite.]{.underline}

[Battery prices are now tumbling as prices for lithium and other
materials fall.]{.underline}

[The average Asian nickel-cobalt-manganese battery cell price fell to
\$90 per kilowatt hour in May, according to analysts at Benchmark
Mineral Intelligence. That was the lowest since 2021 and a long way off
the March 2022 peak of \$166.]{.underline}

### Economy\-\--AT: Overfishing\-\--1NC

#### [No overfishing]{.underline}- stocks increasing, [self-interest]{.underline} checks, alternatives worse

**Hillborn, 19** \-- University of Washington aquatic and fishery
science professor \[Ray, and Ulrike Hilborn, Ocean Recovery: A
sustainable future for global fisheries?, 2019, accessed 12-14-19,
language corrected\]

Unnoticed in all this frenzy of doom, [a stubbornly persistent
cornucopia of offerings at the fish counters]{.underline} of the Western
world [has remained the same]{.underline}, has [possibly increased
even]{.underline}. [There has been no falling off in
bounty.]{.underline}

It should come as no surprise that the real situation is complex: there
are failures and successes. Even though there have been no fish
extinctions, there have been major fish stock collapses, but there have
also been recoveries. [The ocean, far from being drained of them, still
contains lots of fish]{.underline}, [perhaps as many as there were
before industrial fishing began.]{.underline} It is almost perverse that
it is precisely in most of the doom-laden developed countries that [fish
stocks are **not even the tiniest bit declining**, but
**increasing**]{.underline}. [The disconnect between the well-stocked
seafood counters and the common narrative of gloom]{.underline} and doom
[is truly perplexing.]{.underline}

(p.vi) I recognize that most people find themselves outside the world of
fisheries management and are not familiar with the great complexities of
past and present developments. I also recognize that the ever-growing
pressure from advocacy groups can easily take us in the wrong direction,
away from solutions that have been shown to work. Hence, this book.

My aim is to provide interested readers outside of fisheries science
with an overview of the major issues associated with managing global
fisheries, but also with enough detail that anyone can dig into specific
topics. My hope is to correct many of the most common misconceptions
about how fisheries are managed, the status and sustainability of fish
stocks, and the relative environmental cost of catching fish in the
ocean compared with producing food from the land.

Some teasers that may surprise you and encourage you to read more.

[In most of the developed world, the abundance of fish is increasing not
decreasing]{.underline}. [Overall, global fish abundance is]{.underline}
probably [stable]{.underline}.

[The number of fish in the ocean now is likely higher than it was before
industrial fishing began]{.underline}, [and their total weight may be
close to what it was before large-scale fishing]{.underline}. (Hint:
Many fisheries target predators; therefore, more prey survive. Smaller
fish in greater numbers equals more total weight.)

Overfishing can be sustainable.

[There is **no widespread extinction** of marine fish]{.underline}.
[Only one marine fish has been documented to go extinct, and it was not
due to fishing.]{.underline}

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will only increase the abundance of fish
where fish stocks are seriously overfished.

[Commercial fisher\[s\]]{.underline}~~men~~ [have more of a **financial
interest** in sustainability than NGOs]{.underline} or academics like
me. A collapse puts fishermen out of business, whereas NGOs and
academics see their funding increase.

[Capture fisheries are among the **lowest environmental impact** forms
of food production]{.underline}. A thoughtful piscivore could have a
lower environmental impact than that of a vegan.

### Economy\-\-- AT: Overfishing\-\--Alt Cause\-\--1NC

#### Seafood processing is decreasing due to a [lack of workers]{.underline} and [plan closures]{.underline}. Microreactors [can't solve]{.underline}. 

Yereth **Rosen '24**\-\--Reporter and journalist at the Alaska Beaon.
(\"Alaska seafood processing workers made more money in 2023, but there
were fewer of them\", Alaska Beacon,
https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/alaska-seafood-processing-workers-made-more-money-in-2023-but-there-were-fewer-of-them/,
11-21-2024). Accessed 7-6-2025 by NT-RM.

[[Alaska seafood processors **hired fewer people**]{.mark} [in 2023 but
**paid them more**]{.mark}]{.underline} and relied more on nonresidents
to fill the jobs, [a state analysis shows]{.underline}.

[The [**employment trends** are]{.mark} what would be expected [in an
**industry struggling to find worke**]{.mark}**rs**, said]{.underline}
Dan [Robinson,]{.underline} the [state economist]{.underline} who wrote
the analysis [for the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce
Development's monthly magazine.]{.underline}

"[I]{.underline} do [think the reason for that is]{.underline} just
[[they've had to **work harder to get workers** an]{.mark}d to
**[pay]{.mark} workers [more]{.mark}** to come there]{.underline}," said
Robinson, the department's research chief and author of the article in
the November issue of Alaska Economic Trends.

[The [number of Alaska seafood processor jobs totaled **8,495**]{.mark}
**in 2023**, about **[20% lower than]{.mark} the total in
[2014]{.mark}**, the analysis shows. At the same time, according to the
analysis, [total pay]{.mark} to processing workers [of **\$626 million**
last year was]{.mark} about **[30% higher than the aggregate
pay]{.mark}** in 2014, calculated in 2023 dollars, of **\$482
million.**]{.underline}

[The average]{.underline} monthly [wage for seafood workers]{.underline}
in 2023 [was \$6,100, **exceeding the statewide average** of \$5,700 for
all workers, the analysis found]{.underline}.

[Processing workers made more money, despite [myriad woes
afflicti]{.mark}ng [the]{.mark} Alaska [seafood industry, including
**market erosion**, **low fish prices** and **rising
costs.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is not clear whether the inflation-adjusted increase in processor
workers' earnings was from higher base pay or from increased overtime
pay, Robinson said. The department does not have the information needed
to make that distinction.

Increased earnings of either type, along with the smaller jobs total,
point to the same underlying cause, he said.

["Lower employment, higher wages, that [smells strongly of **difficulty
finding enough people**]{.mark} and having to pay them
more,"]{.underline} he said.

[**[Nonresidents made up 82.3% of the]{.mark} seafood processing
[workforce]{.mark}** in 2023, according to the department's
analysis]{.underline}. Nonresidents have long made up the majority of
seafood processor workers, but [the [proportion has **crept up** in
recent years]{.mark}, from about three quarters from 2014 to 2018 to
over 80% since 2021]{.underline}, according to the analysis.

[Workers from outside the United States have]{.underline} also [been
important to the industry]{.underline}, but the numbers who are employed
through a special visa program vary by year. In 2023, the U.S.
Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration certified
Alaska employers to hire 825 workers under the federal H-2B visa
program, which is commonly used for the seafood industry. Of the
authorized positions, 554 were for seafood processing workers, according
to the state analysis.

It is unclear whether all 554 spots were used by the seafood industry,
Robinson said.

In some years, there are far fewer seafood processing workers hired
through these visas. In 2014, for example, the federal Department of
Labor granted only one company's request to hire workers under the H-2B
program, and only 20 workers were authorized, Robinson's analysis said.

[Yet to be determined by the state Department of Labor and Workforce
Development is the full impact of **[seafood plant closures]{.mark}**
that [have **roiled some coastal communities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A particularly devastating closure came this year at the **seafood
plant in King Cove**. The plant has operated for more than a century and
has long been critical to that Alaska Peninsula community's economy and
its main source of local tax revenue.]{.underline}

Robinson said the Department of Labor and Workforce Development does not
yet have all the information needed to analyze this year's seafood
processing employment.

Earth\'s atmosphere." Geology and Mineral Resources of World Ocean,
Volume 18, Issue 2.

The appearance of the ozone layer (OL) in the Earth's atmosphere and the
associated processes of attenuation of the ultraviolet (UV) part of
solar radiation reaching the surface are considered. It is shown that
the [[role of OL in protecting]{.mark} **living [organisms]{.mark}**
from the **destructive effects** of exposure to the short-wavelength
part of the insolation spectrum [is **immensely
exaggerated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ozone is generated by UV radiation
below the ionosphere when oxygen molecules in the air are divided. When
absorbed by UV rays, it is destroyed. Ozone exists for the longest time
at minimum temperatures of the atmosphere. This circumstance and the
[[**increased density** lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[accumulation]{.mark} of O3 [above the tropopause]{.mark}]{.underline},
where the OL is formed. The [amount of **simultaneously existing** gas
is **extremely insignificant**]{.underline} --- [about **10⁻⁶
air**]{.underline}. It is this circumstance that makes it possible to
[[estimate its contribution to]{.mark} the [absorption of **UV**]{.mark}
**rays** as **[vanishingly small]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Compared with
it, the [**[scattering]{.mark} of rays** [by **air**]{.mark}
**molecules** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} incomparably [[more
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}, although each single act of absorption
of the middle part of the ultraviolet is several times greater than a
single result of scattering. One can agree with the idea of the
elimination of ozone molecules by reaction with freons and other gases
containing halogens, including those of volcanic origin. It is also
possible that it interacts with hydrogen, but H2 rather arising in the
atmosphere, and not in the bowels of the Earth. But the [processes of
**changing the OL**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} the
[**periodic formation** of]{.underline} «**[[ozone
holes]{.underline}]{.mark}**», [[do not pose **any danger** and are
explained by **natural phenomena**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} by [[human activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
very expensive campaign to save the layer makes no sense. On the other
hand, ground5level ozone concentration increases over time precisely
under the influence of industrial emissions. In the cities of developed
countries, the content of this poisonous gas already often exceeds
permissible levels and it is time to take up more effective
counteraction to its accumulation.

## AT: Arctic Sustainability ADV

### AT: Arctic Sustainability\-\--1NC

#### [Best research]{.underline} shows ice is [stable]{.underline}\-\--no [tipping points]{.underline} or [collapse]{.underline}.

**Bastach '15** \[Michael; 2011; Senior Reporter with The Daily Caller
News Foundation, a D.C.-based News Organization Specializing in Policy
Reporting and Investigative Journalism; Daily Caller, "Irreversible'
Arctic Ice Loss Seems to Be Reversing Itself,"
http://dailycaller.com/2015/04/29/irreversible-arctic-ice-loss-seems-to-be-reversing-itself/#ixzz4LO47rQRG\]

For years, [scientists have been warning the Arctic was in a "death
spiral]{.underline}" and could soon be ice-free during the summertime
and shrink to unprecedented levels due to man-made global warming. Such
ice loss could be "irreversible," some scientists claimed.

But [**[new research]{.mark}** from the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography [says]{.mark} that [predictions of]{.mark} a permanently
[**ice-free** Arctic are]{.mark} based on **["oversimplified"]{.mark}**
theories]{.underline}. [Scripps researchers,]{.underline} who were
co-funded by the Navy, [found that the Arctic sea [ice may be
"substantially **more stable** than]{.mark} has been [suggested]{.mark}
in previous idealized modeling studies]{.underline}."

"We found that [two [key]{.mark} physical [processes]{.mark}, which
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} often **[[overlooked]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in previous process models, [were]{.underline} actually
[essential]{.underline} for accurately describing whether sea ice loss
is reversible," Scripps climate scientist Ian Eisenman, co-author of a
new study refuting claims the Arctic is in a "death spiral," said in a
statement.

"Our results show that [the basis for a sea ice **tipping point**
doesn't hold up when these additional processes are
considered]{.underline}," echoed Till Wagner, also a Scripps scientist.
"In other words, [[**no tipping point** is]{.mark} likely [to
devour]{.mark} what's left of the [Arctic]{.mark} summer sea
[ice]{.mark}]{.underline}. So if global warming does soon melt all the
Arctic sea ice, at least we can expect to get it back if we somehow
manage to cool the planet back down again."

"If the associated parameters are set to values that correspond to the
current climate, the ice retreat is reversible and there is no
instability when the climate is warmed," according to Eisenman and
Wagner's study.

Eisenman and Wagner's study comes after the Arctic hit its lowest
maximum sea ice extent on record during February. This was followed by
the Arctic having its lowest ice extent for March on record, according
to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Indeed, Arctic sea ice has
been declining at a rate of 2.6 percent per decade since 1979.

Scientists and climate pundits have already predicted this year's Arctic
summer sea ice extent will be the lowest on record, following poor
winter extent. This has only bolstered claims that the Arctic could soon
be ice free.

"Summertime Arctic sea ice is not long for this world," lamented Joe
Romm, a climate scientist and editor for the liberal blog ThinkProgress.
"Because of Arctic amplification, the Arctic warms twice as fast (or
more) than the Earth as a whole does."

Romm goes on to cite a February study claiming that Arctic ice is losing
its thickness and becoming more susceptible to warmer weather ---
meaning it's melting a lot faster. The study, published in the journal
The Cryosphere found that "annual mean ice thickness has decreased from
3.59 meters \[11.8 feet\] in 1975 to 1.25 m \[4.1 feet\] in 2012, a 65%
reduction."

"The ice is thinning dramatically," climatologist Ron Lindsay, the
study's lead author, was quoted saying.

It wasn't long ago that David Barber, Canada's Research Chair in Arctic
System Science at the University of Manitoba, warned there was almost no
multi-year ice left in the Northern Hemisphere.

"We are almost out of multiyear sea ice in the northern hemisphere," he
told Canada's Parliament in 2009. "I've never seen anything like this in
my 30 years of working in the high Arctic ... it was very dramatic."

Arctic sea ice extent that year was at its third-lowest extent on
record, behind 2007 and 2008, and experts were saying there would be no
polar ice during the summer by 2030 for the first time in one million
years.

"I would argue that, from a practical perspective, we almost have a
seasonally ice-free Arctic now, because multiyear sea ice is the barrier
to the use and development of the Arctic," Barber said.

But such [[predictions]{.mark} have **[fall]{.mark}**en [flat,]{.mark}
as the [Arctic has seen a **resurgence**]{.mark} of multi-year ice since
2009]{.underline}.

NSIDC and European satellite data show that multi-year sea ice made a
big comeback in 2013 and 2014 --- increasing from 2.25 to 3.17 million
square kilometers during that time and making up 43 percent of the north
pole's ice pack.

In fact, [Arctic sea [ice]{.mark} extent [**as a whole** seems to be
**stabilizing**]{.mark} despite this year's record low
maximum]{.underline} in February. NSIDC data shows [Arctic sea ice
extent is currently [**within** the **normal
range**]{.mark}]{.underline} based on the 1981 to 2010 average extent.

["Global sea ice is [at a record high, **a**]{.mark}nother [key
**indicator**]{.mark} that [something is]{.mark} working in the
**[opposite]{.mark}** direction of what was predicted,"]{.underline} Dr.
Benny Peiser, [director of the Global Warming Policy Forum, told the
U.K. Express]{.underline} in January.

"Most [[people think]{.mark} the [poles are melting... **they're
not,"**]{.mark}]{.underline} he said. "This is a huge inconvenience that
[reality is now catching up with climate alarmists]{.underline}, who
were predicting that the poles would be melting fairly soon."

[It's easy [to construct **climate disasters**. You]{.mark} just [find
a]{.mark} current, disconcerting [trend and **project it**]{.mark} into
the future, while [**ignoring** everything]{.mark} humanity could do [to
**adapt**]{.mark}. For instance]{.underline}, one widely reported study
found that **[heat waves]{.underline}** could kill thousands more
Americans by the end of the century if global warming continues
apace---but only if you assume people won't use more air conditioning.
[Yes, the [climate is]{.mark} likely [to change, but **so is
human**]{.mark} **behavior** in **[response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Adaptation doesn't make the cost of global warming go away entirely,
but it does **reduce it dramatically**]{.underline}. Higher temperatures
will shrink harvests if [farmers]{.underline} keep growing the same
crops, but [they're likely to **adapt** by growing other varieties or
different plants altogether]{.underline}. Corn [production]{.underline}
in North America has **[shift]{.underline}**ed away from the Southeast
toward the Upper Midwest, where farmers take advantage of longer growing
seasons and less-frequent extreme heat. [[When sea levels rise,
governments build **defenses**]{.mark}---like the levees, flood walls
and drainage systems]{.underline} that protected New Orleans from much
of Hurricane Ida's ferocity this year.

[Nonetheless, many]{.underline} in the media [push **unrealistic
projections** of climate catastrophes, while **ignoring** adaptation. A
new study documents how the **biggest [bias]{.mark}** [in
studies]{.mark} on the rise of sea levels [is]{.mark} their [tendency to
ignore]{.mark} human [adaptation, **exaggerating**]{.mark} flood
[risks]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2100 [by as much as **[1,300
times]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also evident in the breathless tone
of most reporting: The Washington Post frets that sea level rise could
"make 187 million people homeless," CNN fears an "underwater future,"
and USA Today agonizes over tens of trillions of dollars in projected
annual flood damage. All three rely on [studies]{.underline} that
[**implausibly** assume no society]{.underline} across the world [will
make]{.underline} any [adaptation]{.underline} whatever for the rest of
the century. [This isn't **reporting** but
**scaremongering**]{.underline}.

You can see how far from reality these sorts of projections are in one
heavily cited study, depicted in the graph nearby If you assume no
society will adapt to any sea-level rise between now and 2100, you'll
find that vast areas of the world will be routinely flooded, causing
\$55 trillion in damage annually in 2100 (expressed in 2005 dollars), or
about 5% of global gross domestic product. But as the study emphasizes,
[["in **reality**]{.mark}, societies are **likely** to
adapt."]{.underline}

By raising the height of dikes, the study shows that [[humanity]{.mark}
can **[negate]{.mark}** almost [**all** that]{.mark} terrible
**projected [damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} by 2100. Only 15,000 people
would be flooded every year, which is a remarkable improvement compared
with the 3.4 million people flooded in 2000. The total cost of damage,
investments in new dikes, and maintenance costs of existing dikes will
fall sixfold between now and 2100 to 0.008% of world GDP.

Adaptation is much more effective than climate regulations at staving
off flood risks. Compare the two types of policies in isolation. Without
any climate mitigation to help, dikes would still safeguard more than
99.99% of the flood victims you'd see if global warming continued on
current trends. Instead of 187 million people flooded in 2100, there
would be only 15,000. Climate policy achieves much less on its own.
Without adaptation, even stringent regulations that keep the global
temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius would reduce the number of
flood victims only down to 85 million a year by the end of the century.

Stringent climate policy still has only a mild effect when used in
concert with dikes: Instead of the 15,000 flood victims you'd get with
only adaptation, you'd have 10,000. And getting there would cost
hundreds of trillions of dollars, which is hardly mitigated by the \$40
billion drop in total flood damage and dike costs climate regulations
would achieve. As I've explained in these pages before, this kind of
policy has a high human cost: the tens of millions of people pricey
climate regulations relegate to poverty.

You don't have to portend doom to take climate change seriously.

[Implementing sustainable energy policies involves **considering local

those at the national or regional level as they reflect the unique

context of the Russian Arctic energy industry, the state plays a crucial
role in influencing development.Footnote11 Central to the attainment of
sustainability in the Arctic is imperative for optimising resource
utilisation.Footnote12 To reduce the dependence on diesel-based power
systems and increase sustainability, infrastructural investments are

State Legislative Response

This year, [state [lawmakers]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[considered **55

Regulatory Reform and Utility Cost Recovery

[Most]{.underline} of these [[bills]{.mark} either [seek to **roll
back** regulations]{.mark}]{.underline} to allow SMRs a smoother path to
come online [[or provide **tax incentives**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
encourage development. On the regulatory side, [Indiana lawmakers
enacted a bill]{.underline} (IN SB 424) that allows electric utilities
[to **recover** pre-construction costs]{.underline} associated with
building SMRs. Since these reactors prevent a huge upfront cost to
energy providers, [[rate recovery provisions]{.mark}
[lower]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**financial risk** for regulated
utilities]{.underline}]{.mark} to [invest in SMRs]{.underline}.

legislation (AZ HB 2774) that would prevent large counties from
regulating SMRs if the reactor met all the necessary zoning
requirements. That legislation, however, was ultimately vetoed by
Governor Hobbs (D).

Economic Incentives and Grant Programs

[[Economic incentives are]{.underline}]{.mark} always [[a]{.underline}
[**powerful** financial tool to encourage

Proliferation Risks Associated with SMRs

The [[global spread of]{.mark}]{.underline} Small Modular Reactors
([[SMRs) poses]{.mark} potential [risks]{.mark} and challenges in terms
[of **nuclear proliferation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One [[major concern
is]{.mark} the [**dual-use** nature]{.mark} of SMR
technologies]{.underline}, which can be [[utilized
for]{.underline}]{.mark} both peaceful purposes and **[[weapons
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [compact size and lower
proliferation resistance]{.underline} of SMRs compared to larger nuclear
reactors [[increase]{.mark} the [potential for
**misuse**]{.mark}]{.underline} or diversion [of these
technologies]{.underline}. The [proliferation of small modular
reactors]{.underline} (SMRs) [raises concerns about **weapons
proliferation**]{.underline}, especially for governments with latent
weapons capacity. [[SMRs]{.mark} are [**attractive** to
proliferators]{.mark} due to their **lower cost** compared to larger
power reactors,]{.underline} and [power reactors can produce
**significant amounts** of weapons-grade plutonium]{.underline} on
shorter cycles \[Shellenberger, 2018\].

Small modular reactors ([SMRs) [have]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[historic **root in military applications**]{.underline}]{.mark},
specifically [in the development of naval reactors for]{.underline}
submarines and [naval vessels]{.underline}. The [experience gained
from]{.underline} these [military programs laid]{.underline} the
[foundation for the advancement of civilian SMRs]{.underline}. Today,
many SMR designs draw upon the knowledge and advancements achieved
through military nuclear programs, incorporating features such as
compact reactor cores, passive safety systems, and modular designs
\[Maize, 2015\]. While the military pursuit of small, portable, and
reliable nuclear power systems influenced the concept of SMRs, their
focus has shifted towards addressing energy needs and promoting
sustainable energy sources for civilian use. SMRs have evolved beyond
their military origins and are now primarily aimed at meeting civilian
energy demands, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and ensuring secure
and sustainable energy generation. Yet still, [there are [concerns
about]{.mark} the [possibility of **clandestine construction**]{.mark}
or diversion of SMRs for military purposes.]{.underline} The [[smaller
size]{.mark} and portability of SMRs [make them]{.mark} more
**[difficult to detect]{.mark} and monitor** compared]{.underline} to
larger reactors. This [[raises]{.mark} the [risk of **covert development
of nuclear weapons**]{.mark} under the **guise** of civilian SMR
programs]{.underline} \[Green, 2019\]. The [potential for **military
applications** of SMRs]{.underline} could [[undermine]{.mark} the
**[non-proliferation efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and international
security. Furthermore, the spread of SMRs may lead to challenges in
safeguarding and verifying their peaceful use. The [deployment of
numerous SMRs across different countries]{.underline} could [**strain**
the capacity of regulatory bodies and international organizations to
effectively monitor and verify compliance with non-proliferation
commitments]{.underline}. Ensuring robust safeguards, transparency, and
international cooperation becomes crucial to address these challenges
and mitigate the risks associated with the global spread of SMRs.
Analysis of selected SMRs in development has been summarized in Table

can **[preserve human societies]{.mark}** amidst a nuclear
conflict]{.underline}. [Rising distrust in the]{.underline} U.S.-led
[nuclear nonproliferation regime]{.underline} will surely [lead to more
states **seeking** nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The examples of
[**Iran**, **North Korea**, and Syria]{.underline} illustrate. [the
danger posed by WMDs proliferating to **aggressive, unstable** states
and terrorist organizations.]{.underline}

The current nuclear nonproliferation regime under the Nonproliferation
Treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) will have to [[contend
with]{.underline}]{.mark} an increasing number of
**[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the coming years. [Many
[members]{.mark}]{.underline} of the international community
[[question]{.mark} the [commitment of nuclear weapon]{.mark} states [to
disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has led to the creation of the
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons(TPNW) \[1\] . The TPNW has
been criticized by the United States as divisive to the broader
nonproliferation regime \[2\]. While the TPNW is a sign of an effort to
speed up the process of abolishing nuclear weapons, rational deterrence
theory suggests that, today's international security landscape, in part,
depends on the presence of nuclear weapons for stability. Well known
nuclear scholars such as Matthew Kroenig posit that, at least for the
moment, the world is a safer place with the United States retaining its
vast nuclear capabilities \[3\]. In essence, the [slow steps taken by
nuclear weapons states towards disarmament]{.underline},
[hinders]{.underline} their [ability to limit]{.underline} the
[proliferation of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. As this process
continues, it is possible that [more [states **abandon**]{.mark} the
[prospect of nuclear arms]{.mark} [reduction]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[seek to **acquire WMDs** themselves]{.underline}. Amidst the uncertain
future of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, [[new]{.mark} potential
nuclear [weapons]{.mark} [states]{.mark} are
**[emerging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [spent]{.underline} most of its [recent history]{.underline} first
**[acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}** and [then [building
up]{.mark} its **[nuclear arsenal]{.mark}** and delivery
systems]{.underline}. Likewise, [**Iran** has sought a nuclear arsenal
to contend with]{.underline} its regional rival [Israel and]{.underline}
the [United States]{.underline}. Part of the [**[difficulty]{.mark} in
[dealing]{.mark}** [with rogue]{.mark} states]{.underline} is that [each
will [require]{.mark} a [different diplomatic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. While a proponent of deterrence might
argue that mutually assured destruction will ensure global stability,
[North Korea's nuclear capabilities coupled with]{.underline} its
[belligerent rhetoric]{.underline} towards its neighbors, such as South
Korea and Japan, as well as the United States, [is nevertheless
**concerning**]{.underline}. In addition, [the anti-U.S. and
anti-Israeli contingent in Iran]{.underline} that
[characterizes]{.underline} much of its foreign policy underscores why
[the potential for them to acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline} should
be particularly concerning \[4\]. The role of nuclear weapons as a
coercive tool suggests that there is a wide array of aggressive
behaviors for which both states can use nuclear weapons without even
launching them \[5\]. Additionally, [rogue states]{.underline},
particularly North Korea, that [are]{.underline} seemingly [on the brink
of collapse]{.underline} could [[fall victim to]{.mark} the '**[use them
or lose them']{.mark}** logic]{.underline}. According to this logic, the
North Korean leader may feel compelled to use his arsenal if his demise
is in sight.

In addition to being problematic and destabilizing states, [Iran and
North Korea are]{.underline} both [on the United States list of state
sponsors of **terrorism**]{.underline} \[6\]. Another prominent member
of that list, Syria, has used chemical weapons against its own
population in a civil war, which involves the terrorist group ISIS
\[7\]. [[Links between **WMDs and terrorism** pose]{.mark} a
[significant **danger**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [because]{.underline} most
[terrorist]{.underline} groups [do not have a clear territory where a
counter nuclear strike could occur]{.underline}, [which
calls]{.underline} into question [whether **deterrence** would
hold.]{.underline} [[Terrorist actors and rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark} that do not have civilian control over their
military and [have less sophisticated command]{.underline} and control
systems [are more likely to [fall **victim to nuclear
accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[8\]. Each of these situations will
require a unique diplomatic strategy to address the danger of
proliferation. What we know for certain is that the spread of WMDs to
unpredictable states such as Iran, North Korea, and Syria is a threat to
the international security landscape, to the national security of the
United States and its allies, and an impediment to the end-goal of
disarmament. [Until the nuclear nonproliferation regime]{.underline} can
more effectively wed the concepts of deterrence providing temporary
stability and a viable path to nuclear zero, [[nuclear
cooperation]{.mark} will continue to [fracture]{.mark}, leading [more
states]{.mark} to **[seek nuclear weapons
programs]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

terms of]{.underline} the [amount of heat generated]{.underline}, [the
[amount of **uranium fuel**]{.mark}]{.underline} that must undergo
nuclear fission [is [the **same**]{.mark} whether a reactor is large or
small]{.underline}. And although reactors that use coolants other than
water typically operate at higher temperatures, which can increase the
efficiency of conversion of heat to electricity, this is not a big
enough effect to outweigh other factors that decrease efficiency of fuel
use.

[Some [SMRs designs require]{.mark}]{.underline} a type of uranium fuel
called "high-assay low enriched uranium ([[HALEU]{.underline}]{.mark}),"
[which [contains **higher concentrations** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
isotope [[uranium]{.underline}]{.mark}-235 than conventional light-water
reactor fuel. Although [this]{.underline} reduces the total mass of fuel
the reactor needs, that [doesn't mean it uses less uranium]{.underline}
nor results in less waste from "front-end" mining and milling
activities: in fact, the [opposite is more likely to be
true]{.underline}.

One reason for this is that [[HALEU production
requires]{.underline}]{.mark} a relatively [large amount of **natural
uranium**]{.underline} to be fed into the enrichment process that
increases the uranium-235 concentration. For example, the TerraPower
Natrium reactor which would use HALEU enriched to around 19%
uranium-235, will [require **[2.5 to 3 times]{.mark}** as much [natural
uranium]{.mark}]{.underline} to produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity
than a light-water reactor. Smaller reactors, such as the 15-megawatt
Oklo Aurora, are even more inefficient. Improving the efficiency of
these reactors can occur only with significant advances in fuel
performance, which could take decades of development to achieve.

[Reactors that use uranium inefficiently [have **disproportionate
impacts** on]{.mark} the [environment from polluting
uranium]{.mark}]{.underline} mining and processing activities.
[They]{.underline} also [are **[less effective in mitigating]{.mark}**
carbon [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}, because uranium mining and
milling are relatively carbon-intensive activities compared to other
parts of the uranium fuel cycle.

3\. [[SMRs]{.mark} will [**not** reduce]{.mark} the [problem
of]{.mark}]{.underline} what to do with [[radioactive
waste]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [[industry makes]{.underline}]{.mark} highly [[misleading
claims]{.mark} that]{.underline} certain [SMRs]{.underline} will
[reduce]{.underline} the intractable [problem of]{.underline} long-lived
[radioactive waste]{.underline} management [by generating less waste,
or]{.underline} even by ["recycling]{.underline}" their own wastes or
those generated by other reactors.

First, it's [necessary to **define** what "less" waste]{.underline}
really [means]{.underline}. In terms of the quantity of highly
radioactive isotopes that result when atomic nuclei are fissioned and
release energy, [[small reactors]{.mark} will [produce **just as much**
as large reactors]{.mark} per unit of heat generated]{.underline}.
(Non-light-water reactors that more efficiently convert heat to
electricity than light-water reactors will produce somewhat smaller
quantities of fission products per unit of electricity
generated---perhaps 10 to 30%---but this is a relatively small effect in
the scheme of things.) And [for reactors with denser fuels]{.underline},
the [volume and mass of]{.underline} the [spent fuel generated may be
smaller, but]{.underline} the [[concentration of fission
products]{.underline}]{.mark} in the spent fuel,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[heat generated]{.mark} by]{.underline}
the [decay products]{.underline}---factors that really matter to
safety---[will be **[proportionately greater]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Therefore, [[entities]{.mark} that hope to acquire SMRs]{.underline},
like data centers that lack the necessary waste infrastructure, [will
[have to]{.mark}]{.underline} safely [**[manage]{.mark} the
[storage]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} significant quantities of
[[spent nuclear fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} on site [[for]{.mark} the
**[long term]{.mark}**, just [like any other]{.mark}]{.underline}
nuclear [[power plant]{.underline}]{.mark} does. Claims by vendors such
as Westinghouse that they will take away the reactors after the fuel is
no longer usable are simply not credible, as there are no realistic
prospects for licensing centralized sites where the used reactors could
be taken for the foreseeable future. Any community with an SMR will have
to plan to be a de facto long-term nuclear waste disposal site.

#### SMR's create more nuclear waste AND the US doesn't have methods of safely storing it.

[[SMRs **exacerbate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[nuclear waste **storage
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} [Disposal and storage of radioactive
waste]{.underline} already [raises a major red flag]{.underline} for
conventional reactors. This [includes waste produced through the mining

--- like most countries with nuclear reactors --- [**[lacks]{.mark}**
the deep geological storage [facilities]{.mark}]{.underline} necessary
[[for]{.mark} long-term [storage]{.mark}]{.underline} of spent nuclear
fuel. This is due in part to opposition from fenceline communities and
state governments that, understandably, do not want to be burdened with
the nuclear industry's waste. Instead, [[U.S. spent]{.mark} nuclear
[fuel]{.mark} is typically [stored at reactor
sites]{.mark},]{.underline} presumably [until geological facilities are
built]{.underline} --- a [prospect]{.underline} that increasingly
[appears **out of reach**]{.underline}.18 [This]{.underline} on-site
[storage can [lead to]{.mark} the **[release of radioactive
materials]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A 2011 Associated Press investigation
that reviewed [[NRC records found]{.mark} that [radioactive
materials]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[leaked from]{.mark} at least
**[48]{.mark} out [of 65]{.mark}** [reactor sites]{.mark}]{.underline},
with some materials even contaminating drinking water wells.19 [Spent
nuclear [fuel]{.mark}]{.underline} can also [**[ignite]{.mark}** in an
[incident at]{.mark} the nuclear [reactor]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[magnifying]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[release of radioactive]{.mark}
[plumes]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 SMRs do not lower this flag. [[SMR
deployment]{.mark} would [create **more nuclear
waste**]{.mark}]{.underline} with an already troubling legacy, and
potentially add new waste disposal complexities with their use of novel
fuels.21 One recent study suggests that SMRs would significantly
increase the volume of spent nuclear fuel compared to conventional
pressurized water reactors.

military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Iran gave advance notice of the
attack, and Qatar's defense systems blocked the strikes. U.S. officials
said there were zero casualties.

President Trump has celebrated the U.S.'s attack, saying the assault
"obliterated" Iran's three nuclear facilities. He and other
administration officials have pushed back against the early, "low
confidence" Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that suggested the
U.S. military attack set back Iran's nuclear program by a matter of
months.

The [new three-way [**security pact sealed** by]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} and the leaders of Japan and
South Korea at Camp David on Friday was forged with threats by China and
North Korea in mind. But [there was one other possible
factor]{.underline} driving the diplomatic breakthrough: Donald J.
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

While the former president's name appeared nowhere in the "Camp David
Principles" that the leaders issued at the presidential retreat, [one of
the subtexts was the possibility that he **[could return to]{.mark}
[power]{.mark}** in next year's election]{.underline} [and disrupt
ties]{.underline} with America's two [closest allies in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region.

[Both Japan and South Korea struggled for four years as Mr. Trump
threatened to scale back]{.underline} longstanding U.S. security and
economic commitments while wooing China, North Korea and Russia. [[In
**formalizing a three-way alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark} that had long
eluded the United States, Mr. [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} and his
counterparts hoped [[to **lock in**]{.mark} a strategic architecture
[that will endure]{.mark} **[regardless of who is in the White House
next]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"[This is not about a day, a week or month]{.underline}," Mr. Biden said
at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan
and President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea. "This is about decades and
decades of relationships that we're building." [The goal]{.underline},
he added, was [to "lay in place a **long-term structure** for a
relationship that **will last**."]{.underline}

Asked by a reporter why Asia should be confident about American
assurances given Mr. Trump's campaign to recapture the presidency on a
so-called America First platform, Mr. Biden offered a testimonial to the
value of alliances in guaranteeing the nation's security in dangerous
times. "There's not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on
foreign policy," Mr. Biden said, adding that "walking away from the rest
of the world leaves us weaker, not stronger. America is strong with our
allies and our alliances and that's why we will endure." The meeting at
the getaway in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland was a milestone in Mr.
Biden's efforts to stitch together a network of partnerships to counter
Chinese aggression in the region. While the United States has long been
close to Japan and South Korea individually, the two Asian powers have
nursed generations of grievances that kept them at a distance from one
another. The alignment at Camp David was made possible by Mr. Yoon's
decision to try to put the past behind the two countries. His
rapprochement with Tokyo has not been universally popular at home with a
public that harbors long memories of the Japanese occupation in the
first half of the 20th century, but both sides made clear they are
dedicated to a fresh start. "That's a long, bitter colonial wound that
President Yoon has to jump over, and Kishida as well," said Orville
Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia
Society. "That I think is a consonant expression of the degree to which
China's rather belligerent, punitive behavior has driven together
allies, partners and friends within Asia." Mr. Biden hoped to capitalize
on that by bringing the Japanese and South Korean leaders together for
the first stand-alone meeting between the three nations that was not on
the sidelines of a larger international summit. He repeatedly praised
Mr. Yoon and Mr. Kishida for "the political courage" they were
demonstrating. He chose the resonant setting of Camp David for the talks
to emphasize the importance he attaches to the initiative, inviting the
leaders to the storied retreat that has been the site of momentous
events over the decades, including most memorably Jimmy Carter's 13-day
negotiation in 1978 brokering peace between Israel and Egypt. "This is a
big deal," Mr. Biden said, noting that it was the first time he had
invited foreign leaders to the camp since taking office. "This is a
historic meeting." The others echoed the sentiments. "Today will be
remembered as a historic day," Mr. Yoon said. Mr. Kishida agreed, saying
the fact that the three could get together "means that we are indeed
making a new history as of today."

The [[leaders agreed to establish]{.underline}]{.mark} a three-way
hotline for crisis communications, enhance ballistic missile cooperation
and expand joint military exercises. They issued [[a]{.mark} written
"**[commitment to]{.mark} [consult]{.mark}**" in which they resolved "to
coordinate our responses]{.underline} to regional challenges,
provocations, and threats affecting our collective interests and
security."

The commitment is not as far-reaching as NATO's mutual security pact,
which deems an attack on one member to be an attack on all, nor does it
go as far as the defense treaties that the United States has separately
with Japan and South Korea. But it cements the idea that the three
powers share a special bond and expect to coordinate strategies where
possible. China has derided the idea of a "mini-NATO" in Asia, accusing
Washington of being provocative, but aides to Mr. Biden stressed the
difference from the Atlantic alliance. "It's explicitly not a NATO for
the Pacific," said Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. Mr.
Biden and his aides maintained that the collaboration sealed at Camp
David should not be seen as aimed at China or any other country. "This
summit was not about China. This was not the purpose," the president
said. "But obviously China came up." Instead, he said, "this summit was
really about our relationship with each other and defining cooperation
across an entire range of issues." Still, no one had any doubt about the
context against which the meeting was taking place. The Camp David
Principles issued by the leaders did not directly mention China, but it
did "reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait," a warning against aggressive military actions by Beijing. The
documents released were more explicit about nuclear-armed North Korea
and the joint efforts they will take to counter its military, cyber and
cryptocurrency money laundering threats.

[Looming in the backdrop was Mr. Trump]{.underline}, whose mercurial
actions and bursts of hostility while president flummoxed Japanese and
South Korean leaders accustomed to more stable interactions with
Washington.

At various points, [he threatened to withdraw from the U.S. defense
treaty with Japan and to pull all American troops out of South
Korea]{.underline}. He abruptly canceled joint military exercises with
South Korea at the request of North Korea and told interviewers after
leaving office that if he had a second term he would force Seoul to pay
billions of dollars to maintain the United States military presence.

The Asian leaders hope that [the three-way [accord]{.mark} fashioned by
Mr. Biden [will]{.mark} help **[avoid wild swings in the
future]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [president [and]{.mark} his guests
sought to **[institutionalize their new collaboration]{.mark}** by
**committing to annual three-way meetings** in the future by whoever
holds their offices]{.underline}.

"There's definitely risk-hedging when it comes to political leadership,"
said Shihoko Goto, acting director of the Asia program at the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars."

[[By deepening]{.mark} the [coop]{.mark}eration **[below the leader
level]{.mark}** through **various new mechanisms**]{.underline}, she
said, the [[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} may be able to
[[maintain]{.mark} functional [ties **even if a**]{.mark} **[volatile
president occupies]{.mark}** the White House.]{.underline}

"[If a new U.S. president were to avoid]{.underline} going to
international conferences or had no interest in [engaging]{.underline},
[the trilateral [institutionalization]{.mark} of ties [should be
**strong enough**]{.mark} [so that]{.mark} working relations between the
three countries would continue]{.underline}," she said. "So [it won't
matter [if a president didn't show up]{.mark} since the
[working-level]{.mark} military or economic **[cooperation would be
well-established]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

It is not the first time allies have questioned the United States'
commitment to its partners. Despite Mr. Biden's promise at the NATO
summit last month that Washington would "not waver" in its support for
Ukraine and western allies, some leaders openly asked whether the U.S.
foreign policy agenda would be upended by the outcome of the next
election.

Ukraine needed to make military progress more or less "by the end of
this year" because of the coming elections in the United States,
President Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic warned on the first day of
the summit.

Mr. Biden in Finland was also asked about whether the U.S. support of
NATO would endure. "No one can guarantee the future, but this is the
best bet anyone could make," Mr. Biden said then.

At Camp David on Friday, neither Mr. Yoon nor Mr.
**[[Kishida]{.underline}]{.mark}** mentioned Mr. Trump directly in their
public comments, but they [seemed [intent on]{.mark} ensuring that their
[agreement]{.mark} **persists [beyond]{.mark} their
[tenures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Mr. Yoon said [the nations were focused
on building an alliance that could **last for years to
come.**]{.underline} The three nations will hold a "global leadership
youth summit to strengthen ties between our future generations," he
said.

Endurance was a running theme throughout the day. "[We're opening a new
era]{.underline}," Mr. Sullivan told reporters shortly before the
meetings opened, "and we're [making sure that era has **staying
power**]{.underline}."

1\. Introduction

With the heightened electricity demand and need for energy security,
[several [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[expressed **interest in
nuclear energy**]{.mark} as]{.underline} a [pathway to reduce harmful
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. Specifically, the Russian
invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has made European countries return to energy
security as their main concern. Germany has extended the decommissioning
schedule of two of its remaining three nuclear power plants (NPPs)
\[1\], and France has declared that it will open a renaissance era for
the nuclear power industry \[2\]. These announcements by Germany and
France also align with the countries that have not been interested in
nuclear energy but are now considering it as an alternative option to
improve energy security.

In particular, the [nuclear energy newcomer (**[NEN]{.mark})
countries**]{.underline}1 and major nuclear supplier countries recently
[have a [**growing interest** in]{.mark}]{.underline} small modular
reactors (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) because SMRs are promoted as
having advantages over large commercial reactors in terms of governance,
public perception, safety, and financial risk. SMR manufacturers
publicize that SMRs could offer a safer and faster construction
alternative to the large commercial reactors, and ideally complement
intermittent renewable sources of zero-carbon electricity in the future.
SMRs are also advertised to enhance nuclear security and safety by
reducing the amount of plant area, implementing a passive safety system,
and having a long refueling cycle in most core designs.

However, [there are [concerns about SMRs in terms of **nuclear weapons
proliferation risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nuclear [tech]{.mark}nology
and materials]{.underline} inherently [[have "**dual-use**]{.mark}"
purposes]{.underline}. This implies that [it can be [used for]{.mark}
civilian as well as **[military purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [One
area of]{.underline} potential [concern]{.underline} regarding the NEN
countries [is their governance characteristics and political
environment]{.underline}, which can [have significant implications for
**nuclear safety**]{.underline}, security, and spent nuclear fuel (SNF)
management. [[Many]{.mark} of these NEN [countries **scored low**
on]{.mark}]{.underline} regulatory quality, [[government
effectiveness]{.mark}, [control of corruption]{.mark}, and political
stability]{.underline} (see Table 1) \[3,4\]. These [scores [imply
vulnerabilities from]{.mark}]{.underline} the mismanagement and [[misuse
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}. Although
previous studies \[5,6\] have pointed out that the evidence for
obtaining civilian nuclear power to build a national nuclear weapons
program is uncertain, such [[vulnerabilities of]{.mark} NEN
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[introduce]{.mark} new
**[uncertainties in non-proliferation]{.mark}** compliance in the
future]{.underline}. This could result in growing pressure on the
international community to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear
technology. Lastly, the risks due to the external security threat cannot
be ignored by the NEN countries, which are potential SMR clients.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

[The proliferation risks]{.underline}/resistance [regarding SMR
technology have a]{.underline}lso [been discussed]{.underline} in a few
studies, resulting in diverse viewpoints. For example, using [the Markov
model]{.underline}, Glaser et al. \[8\] [argued that **[SMRs]{.mark}**
generally [have **higher proliferation risks**]{.mark} than large
commercial light-water reactors.]{.underline} In [another
study,]{.underline} Frieβ et al. \[9\] [conducted analyses of
SMRs]{.underline}, focusing on the sodium-cooled fast reactor
(Toshiba-4S design), and [revealed]{.underline} significant plutonium
[[production]{.underline}]{.mark} with isotopic characteristics [[highly
**attractive for military uses**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The study
conducted by Mulyana and Chirayath \[10\] evaluated the intrinsic
proliferation resistance of uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel
from a 500 MWt pebble bed reactor and an integral pressurized water
reactor, showing lower resistance values for pebble bed reactor fuel
compared to integral pressurized water reactor. The high proliferation
resistance values mean they are less appealing for potential misuse in
acquiring nuclear material for nuclear weapons/explosive devices.
However, the aforementioned studies have focused on the technical
aspects of SMRs, overlooking the broader context of a country\'s
proliferation risks. Consequently, they did not consider other important
factors such as the country\'s motivation, including considerations of
international security, risk environment, and adherence to
non-proliferation measures, or made assumptions that the country intends
to proliferate. From another perspective, several characteristics of
specific SMR types, such as longer refueling intervals can be a
potential enhancer of proliferation resistance \[11\]. Several experts
have suggested that the inherent impact of SMR on proliferation risks is
relatively minimal when compared to the presence of enrichment or
reprocessing (E&R) facilities \[12\].

[Industry and government]{.underline} in the UK openly [**promote SMRs**
on the grounds that]{.underline} an [SMR industry]{.underline} would
**[support]{.underline}** the [**nuclear weapons** program]{.underline}
(in particular the submarine program) by providing a pool of trained
nuclear experts, and that in so doing [an SMR industry will
**cross-subsidize** the weapons program]{.underline}. Such arguments are
problematic for several reasons. Firstly, the weapons program is
problematic and the UK's compliance with its Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty obligations is questionable. Secondly, why subsidize an SMR
industry to subsidize the weapons program ‒ why not simply invest more
in the weapons program directly? Thirdly, there are strong reasons to
firewall civil nuclear programs from military programs yet there is no
longer any pretense of a firewall.

The arguments are clearly stated in a 2017 report by Rolls-Royce.1 The
company trumpets its role in powering and maintaining the UK Royal Navy
submarine fleet. But its recent interest in civil SMRs isn't a case of
swords-to-ploughshares ... it's ploughshares-supporting-swords. The
report states:1

"The indigenous UK supply chain that supports [**defence nuclear
programmes** require]{.underline}s significant [ongoing support
to]{.underline} retain talent and develop and [maintain capability
between]{.underline} major [programmes]{.underline}. Opportunities for
the supply chain to invest in new capability are restricted by the
limited size and scope of the defence nuclear programme. [A]{.underline}
UK [**SMR programme** would increase the]{.underline} security, size and
[scope of opportunities for the]{.underline} UK [supply chain
significantly]{.underline}, enabling long-term sustainable investment in
people, technology and capability.

"Expanding the talent pool from which defence nuclear programmes can
draw from would bring a double benefit. First, additional talent means
more competition for senior technical and managerial positions, driving
excellence and performance. Second, the expansion of a nuclear-capable
skilled workforce through a civil nuclear UK SMR programme would relieve
the Ministry of Defence of the burden of developing and retaining skills
and capability. This would free up valuable resources for other
investments."

So [SMRs will **relieve** the Ministry of Defence of the "**burden" of
paying** for its own **WMD programs**]{.underline}!

Andy Stirling and Phil Johnstone have carefully studied the links
between the UK's nuclear power program and the weapons program.2 They
wrote in The Guardian in March 2018:

"Their \[National Audit Office\] 2008 costing of military nuclear
activities states: "One assumption of the future deterrent programme is
that the United Kingdom submarine industry will be sustainable and that
the costs of supporting it will not fall directly on the future
deterrent programme." If the costs of keeping the national nuclear
submarine industry in business must fall elsewhere, what could that
other budget be?

"Although unstated, by far the most likely source for such support is a
continuing national civil nuclear programme. And this where
[the]{.underline} burgeoning [hype aroun]{.underline}d UK [development
of SMRs]{.underline} comes in. Leading designs for these reactors [are
derived directly from **submarine propulsion**]{.underline}. British
nuclear submarine reactor manufacturer Rolls-Royce is their most
enthusiastic champion. But, amid intense media choreography, links
between SMRs and submarines remain (aside from reports of our own work)
barely discussed in the UK press.

[Nuclear proliferation risks associated with]{.underline} small modular
reactors ([SMRs]{.underline}) are a [**concern** due to several
factors]{.underline}. Firstly, [on-load refueled reactors require
frequent handling of]{.underline} irradiated [fuel, increasing the
**risk of diversion**]{.underline}. [Breeders]{.underline}, a type of
SMR, [can]{.underline} convert U-238 to Pu-239, which could be used to
[produce **weapons-grade material**]{.underline}. Additionally,
[advanced fuel cycles]{.underline} and smaller fuel element sizes in
SMRs [pose challenges for safeguards inspections]{.underline}. The use
of non-transparent coolants and the storage of fuel elements vertically
also complicate inspection efforts. These factors highlight the need for
safeguards experts to work with design teams and develop monitoring
methods specifically for SMRs \[Kim, 2022; UK Houses of Parliament,
2018\].

In terms of nuclear non-proliferation resistance, the build-up of
transuranics (TRU) in nuclear reactors and the characteristics of the
plutonium (Pu) vector in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) are important
considerations. For proliferation resistance and the nuclear design,
higher burnup in SMRs may reduce the attractiveness of the Pu vector for
weapons-grade use. The relationship between reactor characteristics and
proliferation resistance reveals that smaller SMRs with lower power,
higher burnup, longer cycle length, and autonomous operation can improve
proliferation resistance. However, [there is no consensus on whether the
smaller size of SMRs]{.underline} inherently [increases proliferation
resistance]{.underline}. The [**proliferation resistance** of different
SMR designs]{.underline}, such as solid fuel and molten salt reactors,
also [varies]{.underline}. [Geopolitically]{.underline}, [SMR
development **intersects** with the innovation and arms races between
great powers]{.underline}, presenting both opportunities and challenges.
Governments can support innovation, collaboration, and the development
of demonstration projects to foster the responsible use of SMR
technology and mitigate nuclear risks internationally \[OECD, 2020;
Luongo, 2022\].

### Link\-\--SMRs\-\--Plutonium

#### Plutonium extraction is used to [build nuclear bombs]{.underline}

John **Woodside'23**. (\"Bad guys and bombs: The nuclear risks of small
modular reactors," Canada\'s National Observer,
https://www.nationalobserver.com/2023/11/03/news/bad-guys-bombs-nuclear-risks-small-modular-reactors,
11-3-2023, Accessed 7-5-2025)//Ilake-EO

[Nuclear proliferation experts]{.underline} are [warning]{.underline}
that 50 years of [policy designed to limit]{.underline} the [spread of
nuclear weapons]{.underline} is [**unravelling** as governments invest
in]{.underline} certain [**s**mall **m**odular **r**eactors that could
be misused to build **bombs**]{.underline}.

The concerns are aimed at Moltex, a Saint John, N.B., nuclear startup
building small modular reactors (SMRs) that will be powered with spent
fuel from CANDU reactors. To make the fuel, Moltex plans to separate
plutonium from uranium in CANDU waste and use the extracted plutonium to
power new SMRs.

It is this [separation process]{.underline} that [led a dozen nuclear
scientists to]{.underline} write to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in
September, [warni]{.underline}ng him [that Moltex is a **nuclear weapon
proliferation risk**]{.underline} and calling for a formal risk
assessment of emerging nuclear technologies.

Edwin Lyman, Union of Concerned Scientists nuclear power safety
director, was one of the signatories of the letter. Lyman --- who has
testified multiple times before the U.S. Congress and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission on the topics of nuclear power safety, security
and proliferation --- said that [by separating and concentrating
plutonium, Moltex is completing one of the most difficult steps on the
path to **making a bomb.**]{.underline}

[Nuclear proliferation experts are worried that a]{.underline} Canadian
[company could make it easier to **acquire nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. The CEO disagrees. After decades of policy to
stop the spread of nuclear weapons, the stakes of this battle couldn\'t
be higher.

"[The]{.underline} very [process of extracting plutonium from the spent
nuclear fuel and concentrating it is]{.underline} itself [a]{.underline}
very [serious **proliferation and security threat**]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} [you\'re]{.underline} simply [doing the work of
the bad guys for them]{.underline} by concentrating and extracting
plutonium," he said.

[Extracting plutonium from nuclear waste]{.underline}, converting it
into a fuel and then transporting the fuel to a reactor [increase the
nuclear weapon proliferation threat "**immensely**]{.underline}," Lyman
said. The alternative is leaving the plutonium in the waste, where it is
more difficult to extract, he said.

Currently, nuclear waste created by existing reactors is stored in
facilities designed for interim storage. But because the waste stays
radioactive for thousands of years, long-term storage solutions are a
pressing concern. Canada is exploring plans to deal with the waste by
burying it deep underground. Moltex, which has received at least \$50.5
million worth of federal government subsidies, \$10 million from New
Brunswick, and \$1 million from Ontario Power Generation (and is eyeing
roughly \$200 million more), said its SMRs, which will use plutonium
extracted from the waste and use it as new energy to power a reactor, is
another viable solution because the waste becomes less radioactive in
the process.

Both recycling and burying spent nuclear fuel come with risks. [Burying
the waste deep underground could]{.underline} hypothetically [mean the
site could be exploited as a **plutonium mine** for future **nuclear
weapon production**]{.underline} while [reprocessing it could open the
door for **clandestine repurposing**.]{.underline}

Not only is this attempt to avoid paying for basic infrastructure a
shirking of responsibilities borne by all other power users, [but there
are]{.underline} also [serious **concerns** about the]{.underline}
economics, [**safety and security** of SMRs.]{.underline}

[Nuclear power generates large quantities of highly]{.underline}
carcinogenic [radioactive materials]{.underline} during the course of
normal operation and is therefore not truly "clean" energy. Long-term
management and final disposal of this highly radioactive waste is an
ongoing problem with no solution in sight. States will have to expect
that any radioactive waste generated by SMRs will stay within their
borders indefinitely. [Some SMRs]{.underline} also [rely on a level of
enriched **uranium fuel**]{.underline} [that could be misused to
**manufacture nuclear weapons**]{.underline} [if stolen, posing risks of
**nuclear terrorism and proliferation**.]{.underline}

//TL

Finally, the proliferation risks of these reactors and their fuel is a
concern. The original RFI stipulated that the reactor fuel had to be
high-assay low-enriched uranium ([[HALEU]{.underline}]{.mark}), which is
[uranium [enriched to levels **above**]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[5
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}** uranium-235 [concentration of

the 20 percent that marks]{.underline} the lower limit for highly
enriched uranium (HEU), which is usable in [nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Although [HALEU]{.underline} is considered highly
impractical for direct nuclear weapons use, it [[has **greater
proliferation potential** than fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} with
uranium-235 concentrations below 5% [[because of]{.mark} the [reduced
effort]{.mark} needed [to enrich]{.mark} it to]{.underline} a

NRC -- nuclear regulatory commission

2\. [[SMRs]{.mark} are **[not]{.mark}**]{.underline} generally
[[**safer** or]{.mark} more [secure]{.mark}]{.underline} than large
light-water reactors.

[Because of their size]{.underline}, [you might think]{.underline} that
[small nuclear reactors pose lower risks to public health and the
environment]{.underline} than large reactors. After all, the amount of
radioactive material in the core and available to be released in an
accident is smaller. And smaller reactors produce heat at lower rates
than large reactors, which could make them easier to cool during an
accident, perhaps even by passive means---that is, without the need for
electrically powered coolant pumps or operator actions.

[However]{.underline}, [the so-called [passive safety features]{.mark}
that SMR proponents]{.underline} like to cite **[may [not]{.mark} always
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially during extreme events such as
large earthquakes, major flooding, or wildfires that can degrade the
environmental conditions under which they are designed to operate. And
in some cases, [passive features]{.underline} can actually [[make
accidents worse]{.underline}]{.mark}: for example, [the [NRC's
review]{.mark} of the NuScale design [revealed]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[passive emergency systems]{.mark} could **[deplete cooling
water]{.mark}** of boron]{.underline}, [which is [needed to keep]{.mark}
the [reactor]{.mark} **safely [shut down]{.mark}** after an
accident.]{.underline}

In any event, [[regulators]{.mark} are **[loosening safety]{.mark} and
security [requirements]{.mark}** for SMRs in ways [which]{.mark} could
**[cancel out]{.mark}**]{.underline} any [[safety benefits]{.mark} from
passive features.]{.underline} For example, [the
[NRC]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[approved]{.mark}]{.underline} rules and
procedures in recent years that provide [regulatory [pathways for
**exempting**]{.mark} new reactors, including
**[SMRs]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [from]{.underline}]{.mark} many of the
**[[protective measures]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it requires for
operating plants, [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [physical
[containment structure]{.mark}]{.underline}, an offsite [[emergency
evacuation plan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and an [exclusion zone that
separates]{.mark} the [plant from]{.mark} densely [populated
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is also considering]{.underline} further
[changes that]{.underline} could [allow SMRs to
[reduce]{.mark}]{.underline} the numbers of [[armed security personnel
to protect]{.underline}]{.mark} them [[from terrorist
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} and highly trained operators to run them.
[Reducing security at SMRs is]{.underline} particularly
**[worrisome]{.underline}**, because even [the [safest reactors
could]{.mark} effectively [become]{.mark} **[dangerous radiological
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} [if they are sabotaged]{.underline} by
skilled attackers. [Even passive [safety mechanisms]{.mark} could be
**[deliberately disabled]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Considering]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cumulative impact
of]{.underline}]{.mark} all [these [changes]{.mark}, [SMRs]{.mark}
could]{.underline} be as---or even [**[more--- dangerous]{.mark}** than
large reactors]{.underline}. For example, if a containment structure at
a large reactor reliably prevented 90% of the radioactive material from
being released from the core of the reactor during a meltdown, then [a
reactor 5 times smaller without]{.underline} such [a containment
structure could]{.underline} conceivably [[release more **radioactive
material**]{.mark} into the environment]{.underline}, even though the
total amount of material in the core would be smaller. And if the
[SMR]{.underline} were [[located closer to **populated
areas**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with no offsite emergency
planning]{.underline}, [more people could be [expos]{.mark}ed to
dangerously high levels of **[radiation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

But [even if one could show that the]{.underline} overall safety [risk
of a small reactor was lower than]{.underline} that of [a large
reactor]{.underline}, that [still wouldn't]{.underline} automatically
[imply]{.underline} the [overall risk per unit of
electricity]{.underline} that it generates [is lower, since smaller
plants generate less electricity]{.underline}. If an accident caused a
250-megawatt SMR to release only 25% of the radioactive material that a
1,000-megawatt plant would release, the ratio of risk to benefit would
be the same. And a site with four such reactors could have four times
the annual risk of a single unit, or an even greater risk if an accident
at one reactor were to damage the others, as happened during the 2011
Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan.

The [**global pursuit** of small modular reactor (**SMR**)
technology]{.underline} could [feed into the development of **nuclear
warheads**.]{.underline}

[SMRs are]{.underline} near the [top of the agenda in]{.underline} the
[nuclear industry in the UK]{.underline}. At least [four
companies]{.underline} - GE-Hitachi, Holtec Britain, Rolls-Royce SMR and
Westinghouse Electric Co. - [are competing to have their designs
adopted]{.underline} by Great British Nuclear, and [at the same
time,]{.underline} the [UK's nuclear weapons stockpile]{.underline} is
[due to increase]{.underline}.

Nuclear power was originally created in pursuit of the materials needed
for the development of nuclear weapons during and after the Second World
War.

While there have been major technological advancements, the process
behind nuclear power generation remains similar.

There is an in-built assumption, at least in open discussion about the
nuclear industry, that civil nuclear is pursued for exclusively peaceful
ends, and in particular as part of the race to net zero.

However, the UK does have a nuclear weapon programme with its Trident
nuclear submarines, also called the continuous-at-sea-deterrent (CASD).

NCE asked the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) under
the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act if it had made any assessment of
the potential for SMRs to produce material for nuclear weapons.

In its response, DESNZ said that the deployment of SMRs in the UK "will
comply with UK civil nuclear safety and security regulations and
international conventions to ensure that nuclear material intended for
use in civil nuclear deployments is used for that purpose only, and
cannot be diverted or manipulated for use in nuclear weapons".

However, this statement does not mean that [SMRs can]{.underline}not [be
used to create **materials for nuclear warheads**]{.underline}. [The
fissile material that could]{.underline} potentially [be
used]{.underline} in nuclear weapons [is what is **produced by the
reactor**]{.underline}, [not what is used within it.]{.underline}

DESNZ went on to say that it "neither confirms nor denies that it holds
information" on whether assessments have been made on whether material
from SMRs could be used in nuclear weapons.

"This is a qualified exemption, and we have considered the public
interest arguments in confirming or denying whether we hold the
requested information," it continued.

"We acknowledge that confirming or denying if information is held would

Demand for weapons-grade nuclear material in the UK has increased

The Integrated Review 2021 published under the Boris Johnson government
said: "In 2010 the government stated an intent to reduce our overall
nuclear warhead stockpile ceiling from not more than 225 to not more
than 180 by the mid-2020s.

"However, in recognition of the evolving security environment, including
the developing range of technological and doctrinal threats, this is no
longer possible, and the UK will move to an overall nuclear weapon
stockpile of no more than 260 warheads."

This represented a potential uplift of 16% and it is worth remembering
that nuclear weapons have a shelf life. AWE (the Atomic Weapons
Establishment) is responsible for creating, maintaining and renewing the
stockpile of warheads. The missiles in Trident are supplied by the US
Government.

The Integrated Review 2021 also said the UK Government would no longer
give public figures for its operational stockpile, deployed warhead or
deployed missile numbers.

NCE spoke with University of Glasgow senior lecturer in physics and
astronomy Bjoern Seitz and University of Surry NPL (National Physical
Laboratory) professor of nuclear metrology Patrick Regan to understand
the potential links between SMRs and nuclear weapons.

Regan said: "[The reason we have nuclear power]{.underline} in the UK
[was to make **plutonium** for the **nuclear weapons
programme**]{.underline}."

Seitz said [the UK is "sitting on the largest stockpile of
plutonium]{.underline} in Sellafield," and noted that [only "a **few
kilograms**]{.underline}" are [needed to **create a nuclear
weapon**]{.underline}, while there is likely to be hundreds of tons
available.

Conventional nuclear power plants producing gigawatt-scale electricity
generation are the closest cousins today of the reactors originally used
to generate power and weapons-grade material.

[SMRs]{.underline}, meanwhile, "are trying to use mass production on
more or less existing technology; you use the same nuclear technology as
you would do in Hinkley Point C," according to Seitz.

Reactors generally [start with **uranium** as their fuel]{.underline}.
[Through]{.underline} a process called '[neutral capture',]{.underline}
[the uranium turns into **plutonium**]{.underline}.

["If you have a **conventional reactor**]{.underline}, it creates
plutonium, and [you can chemically separate the plutonium to **produce a
weapon**]{.underline}," Seitz explained.

Safety and Security

Typically in the nuclear field, "safety" refers to accidents that
release radioactivity, while "security" refers to adversaries attacking
a reactor or stealing material for weapons. The two concepts are
related, especially when contemplating [a **reactor** on a
FOB]{.underline}. The Pele Program [requires]{.underline} MNPPs [to be
"inherently **safe**]{.underline}," meaning they would avoid radiation
release in the event of an accident or an adversary attack, but this
[may not be **physically possible**]{.underline} for reasons explained
below.

Reactor designers for decades have pursued inherent safety [via two main
strategies]{.underline}. The first is ensuring passive cooling of the
fuel in the event of an accident -- to prevent melting, fire, or
explosion that could release radiation. The second is creating
encapsulated fuel with a high melting point to contain radioactive
material inside the fuel even if passive cooling were to fail.

However, [potential **attacks**]{.underline} on MNPPs, [and
**countermeasures** intended to provide security]{.underline}, could
**[undermine]{.underline}** inherent [safety]{.underline}. The [most
obvious threat is]{.underline} from [**precision-guided**
munitions]{.underline}. This danger was highlighted in the January 2020
attack by Iran on U.S. forces at Iraq's al-Asad base using ballistic
missiles of two varieties including the larger Qiam-2, which is 40-feet
long and has an estimated 750 kilogram (kg) warhead containing
fragmentation high explosive and/or cluster munitions. Eleven missiles
hit the base and damaged or destroyed at least five structures, leaving
craters as large as 30 feet in diameter (Figure 1), and igniting a large
fire (Figure 2). American forces received warning several hours in
advance, and so were able to take cover and disperse to avoid any
deaths, but more than a hundred troops still suffered traumatic brain
injuries, and 29 received Purple Hearts.22

The missiles were fired from approximately 500 km and were
[**extremely** accurate]{.underline}, estimated to have a 50 percent
chance of landing within tens of meters of their intended target, known
as the Circular Error Probable-50 (CEP50).23 By contrast, in its 2018
report on mobile reactors, the Army had assumed Iranian missiles were
much less accurate, having a CEP50 ten times bigger.24 Several of the
[strikes may]{.underline} have been direct [hit]{.underline}s, including
one in [the **middle** of several structures]{.underline} (Figure 3).
Experts assess that the missiles did not require satellite geolocation
but were terminally guided and maneuverable. The base did not have
[anti-missile **protection**]{.underline} until after the attack, when
three air-defense systems were installed belatedly.25 However, even such
systems [might not]{.underline} have **[prevented]{.underline}** the
[damage because]{.underline}, as a respected French think-tank notes,
"Iran\'s growing [mastery of **maneuverability**
technologies]{.underline} poses the fundamental problem of
[**adapt**i]{.underline}ng the terminal [antimissile
defenses]{.underline} deployed in the Gulf, [whose technologies
are]{.underline} essentially [**optimized** for]{.underline} the
interception of [un-maneuverable craft]{.underline}."26

If a MNPP were deployed to such a FOB, [an **adversary**]{.underline}'s
terminally guided munitions [could **target** the **distinct signature**
of its footprint, heat output, connection to a microgrid]{.underline},
and related characteristics. [This **vulnerability** will **grow** as
adversary munitions become **increasingly** accurate]{.underline}. On
January 1, 2021, Congress reflected such concerns in the enacted annual
defense bill by requiring the Pentagon to provide, "an assessment of
physical security requirements for use of such reactors on ...
non-domestic installations or locations, including fully permissive,
semipermissive, and remote environments, including a preliminary design
basis threat analysis."27

[The U.S. Army]{.underline}, in its 2018 report, [**conceded**
that]{.underline}, "[the MNPP is **not expected** to survive a direct
**kinetic** attack]{.underline}," but it argued that defensive measures
could prevent a direct impact, thereby averting significant radiation
release. However, as Dr. Edwin Lyman, a physicist at the Union of
Concerned Scientists, has explained, [**measures** to avert kinetic
damage might **undermine** the reactor's **inherent**
safety]{.underline}, which relies crucially on convective air flow to
reduce overheating of fuel that could disperse radioactivity.28 The Army
suggests it would [**defend** the reactor from attack by]{.underline}
both [burying it **underground** and **enclosing** it]{.underline} under
a shelter -- "dug in with overhead cover"29 -- but each of [those
tactics would inhibit]{.underline} passive **[cooling]{.underline}**.
Thus, protecting the reactor from kinetic-induced radiation dispersal
could [**increase** the risk of heat-induced **radiation**
dispersal]{.underline}. If so, there might be [**no way** to ensure
against radioactive release]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} the Pele
Program says [is a **requirement**]{.underline}.\
**[Overheating]{.underline}** of fuel could be [triggered
by]{.underline} at least two attack scenarios: [a kinetic
blast]{.underline} burying the reactor in debris, [or
infiltrators]{.underline} sabotaging the reactor by [covering it with
a]{.underline}n insulating **[blanket]{.underline}**. TRISO fuel,
mandated by the Pele Program, is designed to retain its radioactive
material even at very high temperatures, but tests at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) [have]{.underline} revealed [fuel
**failures**]{.underline} and release of highly radioactive cesium-137
at temperatures above 1500° C.30 Micro-reactors using TRISO fuel are
designed not to exceed 1400° C, even in a loss of coolant accident, but
that assumes "direct heat transfer to the surrounding environment,"31
which might not be possible if passive cooling were blocked by an
adversary attack or the Army's defensive measures. Lyman also warns of
"incendiary weapons that burn hotter, such as thermite," and potential
graphite oxidation.32\
Because a MNPP would generate less than one percent of the power of a
commercial nuclear reactor, any release of radiation from an attack or
accident would be proportionally smaller. However, the Army's 2018
report makes a bolder claim -- that the new design of MNPPs would
virtually eliminate risks. Traditionally, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) has required nuclear powerplants to establish radiation
Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs) of approximately 10 miles for inhalation
and 50 miles for ingestion.33 By contrast, the Army claims that, "The
MNPP system reduces the EPZ to hundreds of feet, a substantive leap
forward in safety."34 However, the top counter-terrorism official at the
U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration criticized proposed EPZ
reductions for new reactor designs in July 2020, warning the NRC that,
"Historically, reactor accidents have been the result of or complicated
by unforeseen risks or hazards and/or accordingly."35\
Thousands of [U.S. troops]{.underline} would be [in **close**
proximity]{.underline} to a MNPP on a large FOB and thus potentially
[susceptible to **radioactive** exposure]{.underline} from an attack or
accident. Personnel tasked with rapid evacuation of an irradiated and
possibly damaged reactor core could receive especially high exposure.36
[If U.S. forces **abandoned** the FOB]{.underline} but could not
evacuate the MNPP, [the **adversary** would come into **possession**
of]{.underline} several hundred kilograms of highly
[radioactive]{.underline} spent [fuel]{.underline} in millions of tiny
balls [that could be used for radiological **terror
attacks**]{.underline}. If the adversary could disperse these balls,
which emit dangerous radiation, it could contaminate large areas and
induce panic even if the balls were not ruptured to further spread their
contents. The Pele Program manager implicitly acknowledged such concerns
in an August 2020 presentation, conceding that, "I don't think anytime
soon we're going to have these things actually at the front, there are a
lot of safety concerns with that."37

Can one really invent a reactor robust enough to suffer such a strike
without causing unacceptable consequences? The "[inherently [safe
reactor]{.mark}]{.underline}" has been a [nuclear industry
**[catchphrase for decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but the
[reality]{.underline} has [**never** matched]{.underline} the [rhetoric.
All it really means is]{.underline} that [in certain **idealized
scenarios**, a reactor, after shutdown, could be adequately
cooled]{.underline} by passive mechanisms, such as convective airflow.
But [[passive safety cannot eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} every
[[pathway by which]{.underline}]{.mark} the [reactor [**fuel** could be
**damaged**]{.mark} and **[release radioactivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
If a severe accident or sabotage attack were to induce more extreme
conditions than the reactor was designed to withstand, all bets are off.
[How long would passive airflow keep]{.underline} nuclear
[fuel]{.underline} safely [cool if]{.underline}, say, an [adversary
threw]{.underline} an [insulating blanket]{.underline} over a small
reactor? [Or]{.underline} if the [reactor were **buried**]{.underline}
under a pile of debris?

Moreover, it is [hard to imagine]{.underline} that a [[**direct
explosive breach** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the reactor [[core]{.mark}
would not [result in]{.mark} dispersal of some]{.underline} radioactive
**[[contamination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An [operating]{.underline}
nuclear [reactor]{.underline} is essentially a [can filled with
concentrated radioactive material]{.underline}, including some highly
volatile radionuclides, under conditions of high pressure and/or
temperature. [Even a [reactor]{.mark} as [small as 1
megawatt]{.mark}]{.underline}-electric would [[contain
a]{.underline}]{.mark} large quantity of highly radioactive, long-lived
isotopes such as cesium-137---a potential [**[dirty bomb]{.mark}** far
bigger than]{.underline} the [medical radiation sources that have caused
much concern]{.underline} among security experts. Operating the reactor
for long cycle lengths, another RFI requirement, would increase the
quantity of fission products available for release.

[At best a [release of radioactivity]{.mark} would be]{.underline} a
**[[costly]{.underline}]{.mark}** disruption, and [at worst]{.underline}
it would [[cause **immediate harm**]{.mark}]{.underline} to personnel,
[[render]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[base
**unusable**]{.underline}]{.mark} for years, and alienate the host
country. For any reactor and fuel design, extensive experimental and
analytical work would be needed to understand how much radioactivity
could actually escape after an attack and how far it would disperse.
This is also true for spent fuel being stored or transported.

**[[TRISO]{.underline}]{.mark}** fuel [[enthusiasts]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[long claimed]{.mark} that [reactors]{.mark} utilizing it **[do
not need containments]{.mark}**]{.underline} because each particle
essentially has its own. This would [seem to make TRISO an ideal fuel
for small, mobile reactors]{.underline}, which can't be equipped with
the large, leak-tight containment structures typical of commercial power
reactors. The army report buys into the notion that these "encapsulated"
nuclear fuels can "avoid the release of radioactive volatile elements"
and prevent contamination of the surrounding area, either during normal
operations or accidents.

TRISO fuel's [actual [performance]{.mark}]{.underline} has been

fuel [temperature rises above 1,600 degrees]{.underline} Celsius,
[fission product release]{.underline} can [rapidly increase, making it
[**vulnerable** to incendiary weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} that burn
hotter, such as thermite. And the [ubiquitous [presence of
graphite]{.mark}]{.underline} in gas-cooled reactors---the combustible
material that [brought the world]{.underline} an 11-day [radioactive
fire]{.underline} after the April 1986 Chernobyl
explosion---[[introduces **other dangers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Because
graphite can oxidize at high temperature, gas-cooled reactors must be
protected from small breaches that could allow air or water to come into
contact with their cores.

Nuclear Proliferation

[[Nuclear **proliferation**]{.underline}]{.mark} refers to the spread of
nuclear weapons, materials, or technology to additional countries or
non-state actors beyond the existing nuclear-armed states recognized
under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). It
basically [consists of acquiring, developing, or transferring nuclear
weapons or the **capacity to produce them**]{.underline}. Nuclear
proliferation raises significant concern due to the destructive nature
of the power the nuclear weapons have and the likely potential of being
used in conflict. [This could [lead to **catastrophic
environmental**]{.mark} and **[humanitarian
crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It [**[undermines]{.mark}** regional and
[global **security**]{.mark} by increasing the number of actors capable
of deploying nuclear weapons and [potentially **destabilizing**]{.mark}
delicate [geopolitical balances]{.mark}]{.underline} \[IAEA, 2023\].

[Nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [poses]{.mark}]{.underline} several
risks and [challenges]{.underline}. **[[Security
Risks]{.mark};]{.underline}** the more countries or non-state actors
possess nuclear weapons, the [greater the risk of **accidental** or
intentional use.]{.underline} [[Increased proliferation
heightens]{.mark} the [likelihood of **nuclear
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**,
[terrorism]{.mark}, or **unauthorized access** to nuclear
materials]{.underline}. **[Regional Instability]{.underline}**; [nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration can [contribute to]{.mark} regional tensions and
**[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as [neighbouring
states]{.mark}]{.underline} may [perceive an increased security
threat]{.underline} and [respond by seeking their own nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}. This [[arms race]{.mark} dynamic]{.underline}
can [escalate regional rivalries and [increase]{.mark} the [probability
of]{.mark} **nuclear [confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
**[Disarmament Impediment]{.underline}**; [nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration [**complicates** global disarmament]{.mark}
efforts]{.underline}. As more states acquire nuclear weapons, [the
[incentives]{.mark} for existing nuclear-armed states [to]{.mark} reduce
or [eliminate]{.mark} their [arsenals **diminish**]{.mark}]{.underline},
perpetuating a state of mutual deterrence and inhibiting progress
towards a world free of nuclear weapons. **[Non-State Actor
Concerns]{.underline}**; [the [risk of nuclear
materials]{.mark}]{.underline} or technology [[falling into]{.mark} the
[hands of non-state actors]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as terrorist
groups, [is [heightened]{.mark} with proliferation]{.underline}.
**[[Illicit acquisition]{.underline}]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons or
materials [by non-state actors [poses]{.mark} a [grave **threat** to
international]{.mark} [security]{.mark} and stability]{.underline}.
**[Treaty Erosion]{.underline}**: [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} the [effectiveness and [credibility
of]{.mark} international non-proliferation treaties, particularly the
**[NPT]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The NPT aims to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons while facilitating the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Proliferation strains the treaty\'s objectives and may undermine its
integrity if non compliance becomes widespread \[Panofsky, 2003\].

Why [Nuclear Proliferation Is **a Problem**]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear weapons poses **at least six severe threats** to
**international peace and security** including: **nuclear war**,
**nuclear terrorism**, global and regional **instability**, constrained
US]{.underline} freedom of [action, weakened alliances, and **further
nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}. Each of these threats has received
extensive treatment elsewhere and this review is not intended to
replicate or even necessarily to improve upon these previous efforts.
Rather the goals of this section are more modest: to usefully bring
together and recap the many reasons why we should be pessimistic about
the likely consequences of nuclear proliferation. Many of these threats
will be illuminated with a discussion of a case of much contemporary
concern: Iran's advanced nuclear program.

[Nuclear War]{.underline}

[**The [greatest threat]{.mark}** posed by the spread of nuclear weapons
is **nuclear war**. [The more states in **possession**]{.mark} **of
nuclear weapons**, [the greater the probability]{.mark}
that]{.underline} somewhere, someday, [[there will be]{.mark} **a
[catastrophic]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945,
the United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the
65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear
weapons are unusable, but it would be naïve to think that nuclear
weapons will never be used again simply because they have not been used
for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that worldwide
economic downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of the past,
only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in the decade
and the Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This author, for one, would
be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime in his
lifetime.

[[Before]{.mark} reaching **a state of [MAD]{.mark}**, **new nuclear
[states]{.mark}** go through **a transition period** in which they
[lack]{.mark} **a secure-[second strike]{.mark}
capability**]{.underline}. In this context, one or both
[states]{.underline} might [believe that it **has**]{.underline} an
incentive [to use nuclear weapons first]{.underline}. For example, if
Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its nuclear-armed
rival, Israel, will have a secure, second-strike capability. Even though
it is believed to have a large arsenal, given its small size and lack of
strategic depth, Israel might not be confident that it could absorb a
nuclear strike and respond with a devastating counterstrike. Similarly,
Iran might eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear
arsenal, but, when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will
have a small and vulnerable nuclear force.

[In these **pre-MAD situations**, there are **at least three
ways**]{.underline} that [nuclear war could occur. First, the [state
with]{.mark} **the nuclear [advantage]{.mark}** [might believe it
has]{.mark} **a splendid [first strike]{.mark}
capability**]{.underline}. In a crisis, Israel might, therefore, decide
to launch a preventive nuclear strike to disarm Iran's nuclear
capabilities. Indeed, this incentive might be further increased by
Israel's aggressive strategic culture that emphasizes preemptive action.
[Second, [the state with **a small**]{.mark} **and vulnerable nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in this case Iran, [might [feel
**use**]{.mark} **them [or lose]{.mark} th[em
pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is, in a crisis, Iran might
decide to strike first rather than risk having its entire nuclear
arsenal destroyed. [Third]{.underline}, as Thomas Schelling has argued,
[nuclear war could result due to **the [reciprocal fear]{.mark}** [of
**surprise attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.49 [If there are advantages to
striking first, one [state]{.mark} might start **a nuclear war** in the
[belief]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[war is
**inevitable**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [that it would be better to go
**first** than to go **second**]{.underline}. Fortunately, there is no
historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it
is still possible. In an Israeli--Iranian crisis, for example, Israel
and Iran might both prefer to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike
first rather than suffer a devastating first attack from an opponent.

**[Even [in]{.mark}]{.underline}** a world of
[[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, when both sides have secure,
second-strike capabilities, [[there is]{.mark} **still a [risk]{.mark}**
of nuclear war. **Rational [deterrence]{.mark} theory** assumes
nuclear-armed states]{.underline} are governed by rational leaders who
[would not intentionally launch **a suicidal nuclear war**.
This]{.underline} assumption appears to have [[applied to
**past**]{.mark} **and current nuclear [powers]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}
there is **[no guarantee]{.mark}** that [it will continue]{.mark} to
hold in the future]{.underline}. Iran's theocratic government, despite
its inflammatory rhetoric, has followed a fairly pragmatic foreign
policy since 1979, but it contains leaders who hold millenarian
religious worldviews and could one day ascend to power. We cannot rule
out the possibility that, as nuclear weapons continue to spread, some
leader somewhere will choose to launch a nuclear war, knowing full well
that it could result in self-destruction.

[One **does not need** to resort to **irrationality**]{.underline},
however, [to imagine nuclear war under MAD]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons
may deter leaders from intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they
do not mean the end of international politics. As was discussed above,
nuclear-armed states still have conflicts of interest and leaders still
seek to coerce nuclear-armed adversaries. [[Leaders]{.mark}
might]{.underline}, therefore, choose to [[launch]{.mark} **a
[limited]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.50 This strategy
might be especially attractive to states in a position of conventional
inferiority that might have an incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to
the nuclear level. During the Cold War, the United States planned to use
nuclear weapons first to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given
NATO's conventional inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has
deteriorated since the end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more
heavily on nuclear weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian
strategy calls for the use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict
(something that most Western strategists would consider to be
escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's
military plans for nuclear use in the event of an invasion from
conventionally stronger India. And finally, Chinese generals openly talk
about the possibility of nuclear use against a US superpower in a
possible East Asia contingency.

Second, as was also discussed above, leaders can make a 'threat that
leaves something to chance'.52 They can initiate a nuclear crisis. [By
playing]{.underline} these [**[risky]{.mark} games** of **nuclear
[brinkmanship]{.mark}**, states]{.underline} can [[increase]{.mark} the
risk of [nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt [to
force **a less resolved adversary** to back down]{.underline}.
Historical crises have not resulted in nuclear war, but many of them,
including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, have come close. And scholars
have documented historical incidents when accidents nearly led to war.53
When we think about future nuclear crisis dyads, such as Iran and
Israel, with fewer sources of stability than existed during the Cold
War, we can see that there is a real risk that a future crisis could
result in a devastating nuclear exchange.

[Nuclear Terrorism]{.underline}

The spread of nuclear weapons also increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism.54 While September 11th was one of the greatest tragedies in
American history, it would have been much worse had Osama Bin Laden
possessed nuclear weapons. Bin Laden declared it a 'religious duty' for
Al- Qa'eda to acquire nuclear weapons and radical clerics have issued
fatwas declaring it permissible to use nuclear weapons in Jihad against
the West.55 [Unlike states]{.underline}, which can be more easily
deterred, [there is **[little doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[if
terrorists acquired]{.mark} [nucl]{.mark}ear weapon[s, they **would**
use them]{.mark}]{.underline}.56 Indeed, in recent years, many US
politicians and security analysts have argued that nuclear terrorism
poses the greatest threat to US national security.57

Analysts have pointed out the tremendous hurdles that terrorists would
have to overcome in order to acquire nuclear weapons.58 Nevertheless,
[as nuclear weapons spread, the possibility]{.underline} that [they will
**eventually fall** into terrorist hands **increases**. [States
could]{.mark} **intentionally [transfer]{.mark}** nuclear weapons, or
**the fissile [material]{.mark}** required to build them, to terrorist
groups]{.underline}. There are good reasons why a state might be
reluctant to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, as nuclear
weapons spread, the probability that a leader might someday purposely
arm a terrorist group increases. Some fear, for example, that Iran, with
its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah, might be at a heightened risk of
transferring nuclear weapons to terrorists. Moreover, [**even
[if]{.mark}** [no state would]{.mark} **ever intentionally
[transfer]{.mark}** nuclear capabilities to terrorists, **a [new]{.mark}
nuclear [state]{.mark}**[, with **underdeveloped**]{.mark} **security
[procedures]{.mark}**, might be **[vulnerable to
theft]{.mark}**]{.underline}, allowing terrorist groups or corrupt or
ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous material to
terrorists. There is evidence, for example, that representatives from
Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met with Al-Qa'eda members to
discuss a possible nuclear deal.59

Finally, [**a [nuclear]{.mark}-armed [state]{.mark}** [could
**collapse**, resulting in]{.mark} **a breakdown** of **law and order**
and **a [loose nukes]{.mark} problem**]{.underline}. US officials are
currently very concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear
weapons if the government were to fall. As nuclear weapons spread, this
problem is only further amplified. Iran is a country with a history of
revolutions and a government with a tenuous hold on power. The regime
change that Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could actually
become a nightmare if a nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown in
authority, forcing us to worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear arsenal.

[Regional Instability]{.underline}

[The spread of nuclear weapons]{.underline} also [emboldens **nuclear
powers**, contributing to **regional instability**]{.underline}. States
that lack nuclear weapons need to fear direct military attack from other
states, but [states with nuclear weapons]{.underline} can be
[confident]{.underline} that [they can deter **an intentional military
attack**, giving them an incentive to be **more
aggressive**]{.underline} in the conduct of their foreign policy. In
this way, [[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s provide **a shield** under which
states]{.mark}]{.underline} can [feel free to [engage in
**low**]{.mark}**er-[level aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed,
international relations theories about [**the ['stability-instability
paradox']{.mark}** maintain]{.underline} that [stability at the nuclear
level [contributes to **conventional
instability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.60

[**Historically**, we have seen]{.underline} that [the spread of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} has [**emboldened** their possessors and
contributed to regional instability. **[Recent]{.mark} scholarly
[analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[demonstrated]{.mark} that,
[after controlling]{.mark} for **other [relevant factors]{.mark}**[,
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear-weapon [states]{.mark}** are **[more
likely]{.mark}** to [engage in conflict than]{.mark}
**[nonnuclear]{.mark}-weapon [states]{.mark}** and that **this
[aggressiveness]{.mark}** [is **more pronounced** in **new**]{.mark}
**nuclear [states]{.mark}** [that have less experience with]{.mark}
**nuclear [diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.61 Similarly, research on
internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani foreign
policymakers may have been emboldened by the acquisition of nuclear
weapons, which encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes against
India.62

[Nuclear weapon use in a limited manner may be a serious threat, and the
[prolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [of nuclear weapon]{.underline}s and
the changing state of the world into a multipolar nuclear order [may
[encourage]{.mark} this.]{.underline} Despite tensions between the U.S.
and USSR, they were ultimately able to manage this competition in a
bipolar nuclear world; this competition for advantage and security ended
with the eventual collapse of the USSR. The security dilemma ran its
course without the use of nuclear weapons, and the U.S. rose to become
the hegemon of a unipolar world. However, in a multipolar nuclear world,
the challenges faced previously are significantly exacerbated.
Currently, the nine known nuclear-weapon states are the United States,
the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France, Israel, Pakistan, India, and
North Korea.\[14\] [Strategies that worked in a bipolar world may not be
as effective in the modern landscape, thus preventing the failure of
deterrence---and the subsequent [use of a nuclear weapon]{.mark}---may
be more challenging than before.]{.underline}

The most recent nuclear state, North Korea, is one of the most troubling
in the current group of nuclear states. North Korea is one of the
world's poorest states, facing harsh sanctions and isolation from much
of the international community. Yet, despite the hardships, poverty, and
poor economy of this autocratic state, it managed to defy the
nonproliferation regime and create a fully operational nuclear
arsenal.\[15\] Pyongyang is not bashful about its willingness to use its
weaponry either, stating that it will use its weapons to "reduce the
U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness."\[16\] Such a clear security threat
may increase proliferation elsewhere in response. Allison calls this the
["[nuclear cascade,"]{.mark}]{.underline} and [suggests that [if a
state]{.mark}]{.underline} as weak and isolated as North Korea [[can
defy]{.underline}]{.mark} the [non-proliferation [regime, other]{.mark}
states are likely to [follow]{.mark} suit.]{.underline}\[17[\] If the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is incapable of preventing
such a clear security threat, why would Tokyo and Seoul rely on
Washington to defend them in the face of a nuclear threat? Japan already
has the capability to build nuclear weapons, possessing well-developed
uranium enrichment and missile programs that could allow Japan to
rapidly create a credible nuclear weapons program to defend itself and
its national interests without the United States. According to The
Council on Foreign Relations, there are **[thirty states]{.mark}** that
[have]{.mark} the technological **[ability]{.mark}** to **[quickly build
nuclear weapons.]{.mark}**\[]{.underline}18\]

While Pyongyang claims offensive intentions, it is incredibly unlikely
to attempt to use its nuclear forces offensively against the United
States. Doing so would be an act of suicide, the disparity between U.S.
and North Korean forces is far too great. Instead, these weapons were
more than likely obtained for defensive purposes. Pyongyang may not be
able to destroy the United States, but it can ensure its own
sovereignty. Forcibly trying to topple the Kim regime could escalate
into the use of nuclear force if Pyongyang got desperate, and a strike
designed to eradicate their nuclear weapons would again invoke this "use
it or lose it" mentality. While Pyongyang may not be able to destroy the
U.S. with its capabilities, it can undeniably cause immense harm to the
US. It could cause even greater harm to smaller, closer countries such
as U.S. allies Japan and South Korea. Knowledge of this is a strong
deterrent against U.S. intervention, allowing Pyongyang to carry on less
cautiously without fearing foreign intervention. The creation of this
deterrent may have effectively ensured the sovereignty of the Kim regime
for the time being, and they are unlikely to relinquish this guarantee.
The establishment of this deterrent highlights some of the challenges in
the modern nuclear era. North Korea's outright defiance of the
nonproliferation regime sends a signal that other states can build a
nuclear capability as well and that such a force may be an effective way
to guarantee their sovereignty against the Western world.\[19\]

[[Proliferation]{.mark} to [autocratic states is]{.mark} a cause for
concern, primarily because they are considerably [less]{.mark}
[stable]{.mark} than democratic states and may be [more willing to
utilize]{.mark} a nuclear weapon.]{.underline} The inherently volatile
nature of these regimes poses a significant challenge. North Korea has a
very poor and impoverished populace, held under authoritarian rule.
[Regimes such as these are not known for their longevity and stability.
The [threat of regime change and revolt]{.mark} from within is a
realistic consideration with autocratic states.]{.underline} If this
occurred, it [could [result in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[loss
of]{.mark} a nuclear [weapon, or]{.mark} their domestic [use]{.mark} to
quell a rebellion.]{.underline}\[20\] It could also
[escalate]{.underline} into [conflict]{.underline} as
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} forces
both seek [to]{.underline} [[secure]{.underline}]{.mark} their nuclear
[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[end]{.mark} up [in conflict]{.mark}
with each other]{.underline}. China would certainly not accept U.S.
forces along the Yalu river, and both would want to immediately seek to
ensure the stability of Pyongyang's nuclear assets.

Autocratic states could also safely assume that Western powers would
prefer it if they were a democratic government friendly to the West.
With the international liberal orders push for global democracy,
autocratic rulers are likely to fear Western interference. After
Pyongyang's recent success, a nuclear weapons capability may appear to
be an effective way to prevent Western interference and ensure its
sovereignty.

[With smaller autocratic states, the constant external and internal
threats to the stability of their regimes breed]{.underline} paranoia
and [volatility. Leading government officials tend to be promoted based
on loyalty rather than competence, and [disagreement]{.mark} or
discontent with the dictator may be [punished harshly, stifling
progress]{.mark}]{.underline} and ingenuity. [These regimes also tend to
have [strong military leadership]{.mark} directing the
country.]{.underline} Pakistan is notable in this regard, where the
military maintains significant control over the government and has a
history of instigating a military coup when they dislike civilian
leadership. Pakistan has had four separate military coups since its
creation, with military dictators constantly consolidating their power
into the executive branch.\[21\] [Military leadership is far [more
likely to see **nuclear weapons**]{.mark} use [as]{.mark} a
[viable]{.mark} option, which [increases]{.mark} the
**[instability]{.mark}** of nuclear autocratic regimes even
further]{.underline}. Civilian leadership has arguably been a key factor
in preventing nuclear use thus far. Military officers often possess a
different mindset and attitude on the subject than civilian leadership
due to their career path[. During the Cold War, there were numerous
instances where the Joint Chiefs of Staff were far more willing to
utilize nuclear weapons in a preventive war and were reined in by U.S.
civilian leadership.\[]{.underline}22\]

[Throughout the Cold War, there were **numerous [false alarms;]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}equipment detected missile launches that did not exist, drills
were confused for real launches, and communication cut-offs and the
**"fog of war"** **nearly led to nuclear use.**]{.underline}\[23\] [If
faced with similar threats, it is **[less likely]{.mark}** that an
**[autocratic state]{.mark}** will **[respond]{.mark}** in such a
**[level-headed]{.mark}** manner. With shorter-range nuclear weapons,
this could be exacerbated.]{.underline} These states are less likely to
have a robust, survivable nuclear arsenal. [[If]{.mark} a state's
nuclear arsenal is [threatened]{.mark}, it is **likely to** take action
to **[ensure]{.mark}** its **[survival or use.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Without having the same geographic separation that the U.S. and USSR
did, several states today rely on shorter-range weapons, like
short-range missiles and multi-role fighter/bomber aircraft. Whether
these weapons systems carry nuclear or conventional payloads may be
unknown; [being forced to make a [rapid decision]{.mark} to respond to a
potential threat may [push]{.mark} a state [over]{.mark} the
[edge]{.mark} to ensure its security]{.underline}.\[24\]

[Particularly concerning, at least in regard to stability, is the
[smaller size]{.mark} and the heightened [vulnerability]{.mark} of many
[arsenals]{.mark} compared to other states]{.underline}. The multipolar
nuclear order lacks the same levels of parity both quantitatively and
qualitatively that were present in the Cold War. The number of weapons
between states varies significantly. While exact numbers are typically
classified, experts have estimated a range varying from approximately 20
warheads in North Korea, to around 6,000 for both the U.S. and
Russia.\[25\] Destroying all the nuclear weapons in North Korea is
significantly easier to do than performing the same action against the
U.S. or Russia, and this may be especially true with an even newer
autocratic state that develops a brand-new nuclear capability. The
**[[parity dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}** further extends to
conventional capabilities. A [[state with inferior]{.mark}]{.underline}
conventional [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} such as North Korea
compared to the U.S. or Pakistan compared to India, may feel
**[[pressured into utilizing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or at least
threatening, to use its **[nuclear capabilities]{.underline}** [to make
up for its inferiority. If a nuclear-armed state lacks an effective
conventional response option and is faced with a crisis that threatens
its security, it may **decide to [escalate ]{.mark}**[with]{.mark} a
limited **nuclear [strike]{.mark}** to preserve its integrity and
security.]{.underline}

The primary barriers to the use of nuclear weapons in the Cold War were
the second-strike capability and the threat of [[mutual
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}. But as has been discussed, this
second-strike may [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} have been as
[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark} as previously thought and is
particularly less effective in the modern age. [Such disparity between
arsenal sizes eliminates many other concerns with a nuclear first
strike.]{.underline} The chances of eliminating a second-strike
capability are significantly higher in many circumstances, and the
[abolition of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty has made the idea
of intercepting any surviving nuclear weapons much more
likely.]{.underline} While ballistic missile defense is a fickle and
inconsistent technology, the prospect of defending against a few
surviving second-strike weapons is much more realistic than trying to
defend against a general nuclear war.\[26\] [The disparity between
military strength has led to conflict through all history, and this has
not changed with nuclear weapons]{.underline}. If a state thinks it can
successfully engage and win in a conflict that would bring great benefit
and little harm to itself, the threat of this occurring is great. As
Thucydides cited the Athenians telling the Melians during the
Peloponnesian War, "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what
they must."

[in **a**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nother **[state]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[involve]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[superpowers]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} even **[[every nuclear]{.mark} weapon [state]{.mark} on

What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be
statistical or human, the consequences of nuclear war require an
entirely new paradigm of death. Only such a paradigm would allow us a
proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and
the outer limits of human destructiveness. [Any nuclear war would
have]{.underline} effectively **[permanent and irreversible
consequences]{.underline}**. Whatever the actual extent of injuries and
fatalities, [it [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[entomb]{.underline}**]{.mark} the spirit of [**[the entire

This would be **[as true]{.underline}** [for a]{.underline}
**[\"limited\"]{.underline}** nuclear [war as]{.underline} for
[an]{.underline} **[\"unlimited\"]{.underline}** [one]{.underline}.
Contrary to continuing Pentagon commitments to the idea of selected
\"counterforce\" strikes that would reduce the chances for escalation
and produce fewer civilian casualties, the strategy of limited nuclear
war is inherently unreasonable. There is, in fact, no clear picture of
what states might hope to gain from counterforce attacks. This
understanding is reflected by Soviet military strategy, which is founded
on the idea that any nuclear conflict would necessarily be unlimited.

Nuclear War Between the Superpowers

The consequences of a strategic exchange between the United States and
the Soviet Union have been the object of widespread attention. One
account of these consequences is offered by Andrei D. Sakharov, the
brilliant physicist who played a leading role in the development of
Russia\'s thermonuclear capacity:

> A complete destruction of cities, industry, transport, and systems of
> education, a poisoning of fields, water, and air by radioactivity, a
> physical destruction of the larger part of mankind, poverty,
> barbarism, a return to savagery, and a genetic degeneracy of the
> survivors under the impact of radiation, a destruction of the material
> and information basis of civilization---this is a measure of the peril
> that threatens the world as a result of the estrangement of the
> world\'s two superpowers. 13

Presently, U.S. strategic arsenals contain approximately 9,000 strategic
weapons and 4,000 megaton equivalents. Soviet strategic forces number
approximately 3,000 weapons and about 5,000 megaton equivalents.14 An
exchange involving any substantial fraction of these forces could
promptly destroy more than half of the urban populations in both
countries. The subsequent fallout could be expected to kill upwards of
50 percent of the surviving rural inhabitants as well as create
worldwide contamination of the atmosphere.15

To better understand the effects of fallout, it is useful to recognize
that radiation effects have three basic forms: (1) radiation directly
from the explosion; (2) immediate radioactive fallout (first twenty-four
hours); and (3) long-term fallout (months and years). In areas where
radioactive fallout is of particularly high intensity, individuals will
be exposed to high doses of radiation regardless of shelter protection.
Those who do not become prompt or short-term fatalities and have
suffered radiation exposures above 100 REMs will undergo hemo tological
(blood system) alterations that diminish immunological capabilities. The
resultant vulnerability to infection will seriously impair prospects for
long-term recovery.

The effects of a nuclear war between the superpowers, however, cannot be
understood solely in terms of projected casualties. Rather, these
effects must also include quantitative effects (i.e., availability of
productive capacity, fuel, labor, food, and other resources);
qualitative effects (i.e., political, social, and psychological damage);
and interactive effects (i.e., the impact on the relationships between
the social and economic factors of production).17 When these corollary
effects are taken into account, it is easy to see that policy makers and
public alike have typically understated the aggregate impact of nuclear
war.

This point is supported by a 1975 study of the National Research
Council, National Academy of Sciences, entitled Long- Term Worldwide
Effects of Multiple Nuclear Weapons Detonations. Going beyond the usual
litany of crude physical measures of destruction (e.g., number of human
fatalities, number of cities destroyed), the report portrays the
long-term, worldwide effects following a hypothetical exchange of 10,000
megatons of explosive power in the northern hemisphere. These effects
are cast in terms of atmosphere and climate, natural terrestrial
ecosystems, agriculture and animal husbandry, the aquatic environment,
and both somatic and genetic changes in human populations.

While the report recognizes that the biosphere and the species Homo
sapiens would survive the hypothesized nuclear war, it recognizes that
the very idea of survival in such a context is problematic. Building
upon this recognition, a more recent study prepared for the Joint
Committee on Defense Production of the Congress---Economic and Social
Consequences of Nuclear Attacks on the United States---identifies four
discrete levels of postattack survival. This new taxonomy permits a more
subtle look at the interactive effects of nuclear war and allows more
precise judgments about the acceptability or unacceptability of nuclear
attack damage. According to the study, there are four levels of
survival, in decreasing order of damage.

1\. Biological Survival of Individuals. Individuals or groups of
individuals survive but not necessarily within the organized political,
social, and economic structure of a modern society.

2\. Regional Survival of Political Structures. Some subnational
political units survive as viable entities, but without a functioning
central government.

3\. Survival of a Central Government. Some form of viable, central
control over all preattack national territory survives, but the
effectiveness of this control may vary over an extremely wide range,
depending on the specific nature and pattern of the attack(s).

4\. Survival Intact of Basic Societal Structure. Damage to the nation is
characterized as relatively limited socially, politically and
economically; nevertheless, the attack is militarily destructive. This
is the concept of survival envisioned in the notion of limited or
controlled nuclear war. However, it should be noted that the idea that
effective strategic military attacks can be benign in their impacts on
society is in dispute. It is used here as a criterion without any
implicit acceptance that it can be achieved. 19

There are, however, levels of strategic exchange at which even the first
listed category of survival might not be relevant. At such levels, the
species itself---let alone organized political, social, and economic
structures---would disappear. The plausibility of such levels is
underscored by the fact that the magnitude of exchange postulated in the
NAS report is really quite low. Were the superpowers to exchange between
50,000 and 100,000 megatons of nuclear explosives, rather than the
10,000 megatons assumed by the report, worldwide climatological changes
would imperil the physical existence of Homo sapiens.

Worldwide Nuclear War

If nuclear terrorism should lead to worldwide nuclear war,
[the]{.underline} **[results]{.underline}** [would represent
[humankind\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[last]{.mark} and [most complete
calamity]{.mark}**, defying not only our]{.underline}
**[imaginations]{.underline}** [of disaster, but our]{.underline}
[**customary measurements as well**. As the culmination of]{.underline}
what Camus once described as \"**[years]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
absolutely [**insane history**,\" worldwide nuclear war would represent
the]{.underline} **[final eradication of the very boundaries of
annihilation]{.underline}**.

In technical terms, the consequences of systemwide nuclear war would
[include]{.underline} [[**atmospheric effects**; effects on]{.mark}
natural]{.underline} **[terrestrial [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}**;
effects on managed terrestrial ecosystems; [and]{.underline} effects on
[the]{.underline} **[aquatic environment]{.underline}**.

Atmospheric effects would be [highlighted by greatly
[reduced]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ozone]{.underline}**]{.mark}
concentrations producing [increased]{.underline}
**[u]{.underline}**ltra**[v]{.underline}**iolet [radiation]{.underline}
[and a]{.underline} **[drop in]{.underline}** average
**[temperature]{.underline}**. Even the possibility of
**[irreversible]{.underline}** climatic **[shifts]{.underline}** [cannot
be ruled out]{.underline}.

Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide nuclear
war through three principal stress factors: ionizing radiation; uv-B
radiation; and climatic change. [[The **cumulative
effect**]{.underline}]{.mark} of these three factors [would [render
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[entire planet a \"hot
spot\"]{.underline}**]{.mark} where even vast forests would
[show]{.underline} physiological and **[genetic damage]{.underline}**.21

Managed Terrestrial Ecosystems would be affected by systemwide nuclear
war by radionuclide contamination of foods, chromosome breakage and gene
mutations in crops, and yield-reducing sterility in seed crops.
[The]{.underline} **[cumulative effect]{.underline}** of these changes
[would be the]{.underline} **[disappearance]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology **[base for
ag]{.underline}**riculture. Even if there were any significant 11
survivors, a return to normal world food production would be
unimaginable.22

Aquatic effects of a systemwide nuclear war would stem from ionizing
radiation from radionuclides in marine waters and fresh waters; solar uv
radiation; and changes in water temperatures associated with climate.
**[Irreversible injuries]{.underline}** to sensitive aquatic species
[could be anticipated]{.underline} during the years of large transient
increase in uv-B isolation. And the range of geographic distribution of
sensitive populations of aquatic organisms could be reduced.23

Nuclear terrorism post-cold war: trigger for inadvertent nuclear war?

The possible catalytic effect of nuclear terrorism on the risk of
state-based nuclear war is not a simple linkage. [The multiple
types]{.underline} and scales [of nuclear
[terrori]{.mark}sm]{.underline} may affect state-nuclear use decisions
along multiple pathways [that [lead to **inadvertent**]{.mark} **nuclear
[war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These [include:]{.underline}

- **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**arly **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning
  **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystems fail or [are **["tripped"]{.mark}**
  in ways that lead to **l**aunch-**o**n-**w**arning]{.underline}

- [**[Accidental]{.mark}** nuclear [detonation]{.mark}]{.underline},
  including sub-critical explosions.

- Strategic [**[miscalc]{.mark}ulation** in crisis]{.underline}, show of
  force

- Decision-making failure (such as irrational, misperception, bias,
  degraded, group, and time-compressed decision-making)

- Allied or enemy choices (to seek revenge, to exploit nuclear risk, to
  act out of desperation)

- Organizational cybernetics whereby a nuclear command-control-and
  communications [(NC3) system generates **error**]{.underline},
  including the interplay of national NC3 systems in what may be termed
  the meta-NC3 system.

Synchronous and coincident combinations of above.\[4\]

Exactly how, where, and when nuclear terrorism may "ambush" nuclear
armed states already heading for or on such a path to inadvertent
nuclear war depends on who is targeting whom at a given time, either
immediately due to high tension, or generally due to a structural
conflict between states. Nuclear armed states today form a complex set
of global threat relationships that are not distributed uniformly across
the face of Earth. Rather, based on sheer firepower and reach, the nine
nuclear weapons states form a global hierarchy with at least four tiers,
viz:

> Tier 1: United States, clear technological supremacy and qualitative
> edge.
>
> Tier 2: Russia, China, global nuclear powers and peers with the United
> States due to the unique destructive power of even relatively small
> nuclear arsenals, combined with global reach of missile and bomber
> delivery systems, thereby constituting a two-tiered global "nuclear
> triangle" with the United States.
>
> Tier 3: France, UK, NATO nuclear sharing and delivery NATO members
> (Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey) and the NATO and
> Pacific nuclear umbrella states (Japan, South Korea, Australia) that
> depend on American nuclear extended deterrence and directly and
> indirectly support US and US-allied nuclear operations even though
> they do not host nor deliver nuclear weapons themselves.

The first two tiers constitute the global nuclear threat triangle that
exists between the United States, Russia, and China, forming a global
nuclear "truel." Each of these states targets the others; each
represents an existential threat to the other; and each has a long
history of mutual nuclear threat that is now a core element of their
strategic identity.

Tier three consists of states with their own nuclear force but
integrated with that of the United States (even France!) that expand the
zone of mutual nuclear threat over much of the northern and even parts
of the southern hemisphere; and states that host American nuclear
command, control, communications, and intelligence systems that support
US nuclear operations and to whom nuclear deterrence is "extended" (if,
for example, Australia's claim to having an American nuclear umbrella is
believed). The fourth tier is composed of smaller nuclear forces with a
primarily regional reach and focus.

Between most of these nuclear armed states and across the tiers, there
are few shared "rules of the road." The more of these states that are
engaged in a specific conflict and location, the more unpredictable and
unstable this global nuclear threat system becomes, with the potential
for cascading and concatenating effects. Indeed, as the number of
nuclear states projecting nuclear threat against each other increases,
the notion of strategic stability may lose all meaning.

The emergence of a fifth tier---of non-state actors with the capacity to
project nuclear threat against nuclear-armed and nuclear umbrella states
(although not only these states)---is a critically important possible
catalytic actor in the new conditions of nuclear threat complexity that
already exist today. Such a layer represents an "edge of chaos" where
the attempts by nuclear armed states to exert absolute "vertical"
control over the use of nuclear weapons confront the potential of
non-state entities and even individuals (insiders) to engage in
"horizontal" nuclear terrorism, presenting radically different control
imperatives to the standard paradigm of organizational procedures,
technical measures, and safeguards of various kinds. This tier is like
the waves and tides on a beach that quickly surrounds and then causes
sand castles to collapse.

In 2010, Robert Ayson reviewed the potential linkages between
inter-state nuclear war and non-state terrorism. He concluded:
"...\[T\]hese two nuclear worlds---[a non-state actor nuclear attack and
a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not]{.underline}
necessarily [separable]{.underline}. It is just possible that some sort
of terrorist attack, and especially [an act of [nuc]{.mark}lear
[terror]{.mark}ism, could **[precipitate]{.mark} a chain of events**
leading to a **[mass]{.mark}ive [exchange]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} between two or more of the states that possess
them."\[5\] How this linkage might unfold is the subject of the next
sections of this essay.

#### Means and motive exist \-- future attacks are [impending]{.underline} and barriers are [surmountable]{.underline}.

Are non-state actors motivated and able to attempt nuclear terrorism?

A diverse set of non-state actors have engaged in terrorist
activities---for which there is no simple or consensual definition. In
2011, there were more than 6,900 known extremist, terrorist and other
organizations associated with guerrilla warfare, political violence,
protest, organized crime and cyber-crime. Of these, about 120 terrorist
and extremist groups had been blacklisted by the United Nations, the
European Union and six major countries.\[6\]

[Some have argued that the technical, organizational, and funding
demanded for a successful nuclear attack]{.underline}, especially
involving nuclear weapons, [exceeds the capacity of]{.underline} most of
the [non-state actors]{.underline} with terrorist proclivities.
[Unfortunately, this assertion is not true]{.underline}, especially at
lower levels of impact as shown in Figure 1; but even at the highest
levels of obtaining authentic nuclear weapons capabilities, [a small
number of [non-state actors]{.mark} already [exhibit]{.mark} the
[**motivation** and]{.mark} possible **[capacity]{.mark}** to become
nuclear-armed]{.underline}.

Ellingsen suggests a useful distinction that nuclear terrorists may be
impelled by two divergent motivations, as shown in Figure 2, creating
"opportunistic" and "patient" profiles.\[7\] The requirements for an
opportunist non-state nuclear terrorist tend towards immediate use and
the search for short-term payoffs with only tactical levels of
commitment; whereas the patient non-state nuclear terrorist is able and
willing to sustain a long-term acquisition effort to deal a strategic
blow to an adversary in a manner that could be achieved only with
nuclear weapons.

Figure 2: Opportunist versus strategic nuclear terrorist motivation

In turn, many factors will drive how a potential nuclear terrorist
non-state organization that obtains nuclear weapons or materials may
seek to employ them, especially in its nuclear command-and-control
orientations.

Blair and Ackerman suggest that the goals, conditions, and capacity
limitations that shape a possible nuclear terrorist's posture lead
logically to three types of nuclear terrorist nuclear
command-and-control postures, viz: pre-determined (in which the
leadership sends a fire order to a nuclear-armed subordinate and no
change is entertained and no capacity to effect change is established in
the field, that is, the order is fire-and-forget); assertive (in which
only the central command can issue a nuclear fire order, central control
is maintained at all times, with resulting demanding communications
systems to support such control); and delegative (in which lower level
commanders control nuclear weapons and have pre-delegated authority to
use them in defined circumstances, for example, evidence of nuclear
explosions combined with loss-of-connectivity with their central
command).\[8\] An example of such delegative control system was the
November 26, 2008 attack on Mumbai that used social media reporting to
enable the attacking terrorists to respond to distant controller
direction and to adapt to counter-terrorist attacks---a connectivity
tactic that the authorities were too slow to shut down before mayhem was
achieved.\[9\]

Logically, one might expect nuclear terrorists oriented toward
short-term, tactical goals to employ pre-determined nuclear
command-and-control strategies in the hope that the speed of attack and
minimum field communications avoids discovery and interdiction before
the attack is complete; whereas [nuclear terrorists]{.underline}
oriented toward long-term, strategic goals [might employ more
pre-delegative **c**]{.underline}ommand-[and-**c**]{.underline}ontrol
[systems]{.underline} that would support a bargaining use and therefore
a field capacity to deploy nuclear weapons or materials that can
calibrate actual attack based on communications with the central
leadership with the risk of interdiction through surveillance and
counter-attack. These differing strategic motivations, timelines, and
strategies in many respects invert those of nuclear weapons states that
rely on large organizations, procedures, and technical controls, to
ensure that nuclear weapons are never used without legitimate
authorization; and if they are used, to minimize needless civilian
casualties (at least some nuclear armed states aspire to this outcome).
The repertoire of state-based practices that presents other states with
credible nuclear threat and reassures them that nuclear weapons are
secure and controlled is likely to be completely mismatched with the
strengths and strategies of non-state nuclear terrorists that may seek
to maximize civilian terror, are not always concerned about their own
survival or even that of their families and communities-of-origin, and
may be willing to take extraordinary risk combined with creativity to
exploit the opportunities for attack presented by nuclear weapons,
umbrella, and non-nuclear states, or their private adversaries.

For non-state actors to succeed at complex engineering project such as
acquiring a nuclear weapons or nuclear threat capacity demands
substantial effort. Gary Ackerman specifies that to have a chance of
succeeding, non-state actors with nuclear weapons aspirations must be
able to demonstrate that they control substantial resources, have a safe
haven in which to conduct research and development, have their own or
procured expertise, are able to learn from failing and have the stamina
and strategic commitment to do so, and manifest long-term planning and
ability to make rational choices on decadal timelines. He identified
[five such violent non-state actors]{.underline} who [already
conducted]{.underline} such [engineering projects]{.underline} (see
Figure 3), and also noted the important facilitating condition of a
global network of expertize and hardware. Thus, [although [the
**skill**, **financial**, and **materiel requirements**]{.mark} of a
non-state nuclear weapons project present a high bar, they [are]{.mark}
**certainly [reachable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Figure 3: Complex engineering projects by five violent non-state actors
& Khan network

Along similar lines, James Forest examined the extent to which non-state
actors can pose a threat of nuclear terrorism.\[10\] He notes that such
entities face practical constraints, including expense, the obstacles to
stealing many essential elements for nuclear weapons, the risk of
discovery, and the difficulties of constructing and concealing such
weapons. He also recognizes the strategic constraints that work against
obtaining nuclear weapons, including a cost-benefit analysis, possible
de-legitimation that might follow from perceived genocidal intent or
use, and the primacy of political-ideological objectives over long-term
projects that might lead to the group's elimination, the availability of
cheaper and more effective alternatives that would be foregone by
pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the risk of failure and/or discovery
before successful acquisition and use occurs. In the past, almost
all---but not all---non-state terrorist groups appeared to be restrained
by a combination of high practical and strategic constraints, plus their
own cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of pursuing nuclear
weapons. However, should some or all of these constraints diminish, a
[**[rapid]{.mark}** non-state nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [is
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Although only]{.underline} a few non-state actors such as
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**l **[[Q]{.underline}]{.mark}**aeda [[and
**I**]{.underline}]{.mark}slamic **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate have
[[exhibited]{.underline}]{.mark} such underlying stamina and
[organizational [capacities]{.mark} and]{.underline} actually [attempted
to obtain]{.underline} nuclear weapons-related skills, hardware, and
materials, [the **past is not prologue**. [A]{.mark}n **incredibly
[diverse set]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} variously motivated terrorist [groups
**exist**]{.mark} **already**]{.underline}, including
politico-ideological, apocalyptic-millenarian, politico-religious,
nationalist-separatist, ecological, and political-insurgency entities,
some of which converge with criminal-military and criminal-scientist
(profit based) networks; but also pyscho-pathological mass killing
cults, lone wolves, and ephemeral copy-cat non-state actors. [The
social, **economic**, and **deculturating** conditions that **generate**
such entities are likely to persist and even **expand**]{.underline}.

In particular, [rapidly growing]{.underline} coastal
[mega-cities]{.underline} as part of rapid global urbanization
[offer]{.underline} such [actors]{.underline} the [ability to
sustain]{.underline} themselves as ["flow gatekeepers,"]{.underline}
possibly in alliance with global criminal networks, thereby supplanting
the highland origins of many of today's non-state violent actors with
global reach.\[11\] [Other contributing factors]{.underline}
contributing to the supply of possible non-state actors seeking nuclear
weapons [include]{.underline} new entries such as city states in search
of new security strategies, megacities creating their own
transnationally active security forces, [non-states]{.underline} with
partial or complete territorial control [such as **Taiwan**
and]{.underline} various micro-states, **[failing states]{.underline}**,
provinces in dissociating, failing states that fall victim to internal
chaos and the displacement effects of untrammeled globalization, and
altogether failed states resulting in ungoverned spaces. To this must be
added domestic terrorist entities in the advanced industrial states as
they hollow out their economies due to economic globalization and
restructuring, adjust to cross-border migration, and adapt to cultural
and political dislocation.

In short, the prognosis is for the fifth tier of non-state actors to
beset the other four tiers with intense turbulence just as waves on a
beach swirl around sandcastles, washing away their foundations, causing
grains of sand to cascade, and eventually collapsing the whole
structure.

Observed non-state nuclear threats and attacks

In light of the constraints faced by non-state terrorist actors in past
decades, it is not surprising that the constellation of actual nuclear
terrorist attacks and threats has been relatively limited during and
since the end of the Cold War. As Martha Crenshaw noted in a comment on
the draft of this paper:

We still don't know why terrorists (in the sense of non-state actors)
have not moved into the CBRN \[chemical,biological, radiological or
nuclear \] domain. (Many people think biosecurity is more critical, for
that matter.) Such a move would be extremely risky for the terrorist
actor, even if the group possessed both capability (resources, secure
space, time, patience) and motivation (willingness to expend the effort,
considering opportunity costs). So far it appears that "conventional"
terrorism serves their purposes well enough. Most of what we have seen
is rhetoric, with some scattered and not always energetic
initiatives.\[12\]

Nonetheless, those that have occurred demonstrate unambiguously that
such threats and [attacks are **not merely hypothetical**]{.underline},
in spite of the limiting conditions outlined above. [[One]{.mark} survey
[documented **eighty**]{.mark} **actual, planned [attacks]{.mark}** on
nuclear facilities containing nuclear materials between
1961-2016]{.underline}\[13\] as follows:

- 80 attacks in 3 waves (1970s armed assaults, 1990s thefts, post-2010,
  breaches)

- High threat attacks: 32/80 attacks posed substantial, verified threat
  of which 44 percent involved insiders.

- All types of targets were found in the data set---on reactors, other
  nuclear facilities, military bases leading Gary Ackerman and to
  conclude: "Overall, empirical evidence suggests that there are
  sufficient cases in each of the listed categories that no type of
  threat can be ignored."\[14\]

[[No region was **immune**; **no year**]{.underline}]{.mark} was
[[without]{.underline}]{.mark} such a [threat or
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [there is a likely to
b]{.underline}e a coincidence of [**future** non-state
threats]{.underline} and attacks [with]{.underline} inter-state
[**nuclear-prone** conflicts]{.underline}, as in the past, and possibly
more so given the current trend in and the generative conditions for
global terrorist activity that will likely pertain in the coming
decades.

Of these attacks, about a quarter each were ethno-nationalist, secular
utopian, or unknown in motivation; and the remaining quarter were a
motley mix of religious (11 percent), "other" (5 percent),
personal-idiosyncratic (4 percent), single issue (2 percent) and state
sponsored (1 percent) in motivation.

Non-state nuclear attack as trigger of inter-state nuclear war in
Northeast Asia

The critical issue is how [a nuclear terrorist [attack]{.mark} may
**["catalyze"]{.mark} inter-state [nuclear war]{.mark}**[,
especially]{.mark} the **NC3 [systems]{.mark}** [that inform]{.mark} and
partly **determine** [how leaders respond]{.mark} to nuclear
threat]{.underline}. Current conditions in Northeast Asia suggest that
[multiple precursory conditions for nuclear terrorism already exist or
exist in **nascent form**]{.underline}. In Japan, for example,
low-level, individual, terroristic violence with nuclear materials,
against nuclear facilities, is real. In all countries of the region,
[the [risk of **diversion**]{.mark} of nuclear material [is
**real**]{.mark}]{.underline}, although the risk is likely
**[high]{.underline}**er [[due to]{.mark} **volume** and **laxity** of
security]{.underline} in some countries of the region than in others. In
all countries, [the risk of an **[insider]{.mark} "sleeper"
[threat]{.mark}** is real in]{.underline} security and [nuclear
agencies]{.underline}, and such insiders already operated in actual
terrorist organizations. Insider corruption is also observable in
nuclear fuel cycle agencies in all countries of the region. The threat
of extortion to induce insider cooperation is also real in all
countries. The possibility of a cult attempting to build and buy nuclear
weapons is real and has already occurred in the region.\[15\]
Cyber-terrorism against nuclear reactors is real and such attacks have
already taken place in South Korea (although it remains difficult to
attribute the source of the attacks with certainty). The stand-off
ballistic and drone threat to nuclear weapons and fuel cycle facilities
is real in the region, including from non-state actors, some of whom
have already adopted and used such technology almost instantly from when
it becomes accessible (for example, drones).\[16\]

Two other broad risk factors are also present in the region. The social
and political conditions for extreme ethnic and xenophobic nationalism
are emerging in China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. Although there has been
no risk of attack on or loss of control over nuclear weapons since their
removal from Japan in 1972 and from South Korea in 1991, this risk
continues to exist in North Korea, China, and Russia, and to the extent
that they are deployed on aircraft and ships of these and other nuclear
weapons states (including submarines) deployed in the region's high
seas, also outside their territorial borders.

The most conducive circumstance for catalysis to occur due to a nuclear
terrorist attack might involve the following nexi of timing and
conditions:

1.  Low-level, tactical, or random [individual terrorist
    attacks]{.underline} for whatever reasons, even assassination of
    national leaders, up to and including dirty radiological bomb
    attacks, that [overlap with inter-state crisis dynamics in ways that
    affect state decisions to]{.underline} threaten with or to [use
    nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This might be undertaken by an
    opportunist nuclear terrorist entity in search of rapid and high
    political impact.

2.  Attacks on major national or international events in each country to
    maximize terror and to de-legitimate national leaders and whole
    governments. In Japan, for example, more than ten heads of state and
    senior ministerial international meetings are held each year. For
    the strategic nuclear terrorist, patiently acquiring higher level
    nuclear threat capabilities for such attacks and then staging them
    to maximum effect could accrue strategic gains.

3.  Attacks or threatened attacks, including deception and disguised
    attacks, will have maximum leverage when nuclear-armed states are
    near or on the brink of war or during a national crisis (such as
    Fukushima), when intelligence agencies, national leaders, facility
    operators, surveillance and policing agencies, and first responders
    are already maximally committed and over-extended.

At this point, we note an important caveat to the original concept of
catalytic nuclear war as it might pertain to nuclear terrorist threats
or attacks. Although an attack might be disguised so that it is
attributed to a nuclear-armed state, or a ruse might be undertaken to
threaten such attacks by deception, in reality a catalytic strike by a
nuclear weapons state in conditions of mutual vulnerability to nuclear
retaliation for such a strike from other nuclear armed states would be
highly irrational.

Accordingly, [the effect of nuclear [terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline}
involving a nuclear detonation or major radiological release may not of
itself be *catalytic* of *nuclear* war---at least not
intentionally--because it will not lead directly to the destruction of a
targeted nuclear-armed state. Rather, it [[may be
**catalytic**]{.underline}]{.mark} of non-nuclear war between states,
especially if the non-state actor turns out to be aligned with or
sponsored by a state (in many Japanese minds, the natural candidate for
the perpetrator of such an attack is the pro-North Korean General
Association of Korean Residents, often called Chosen Soren, which
represents many of the otherwise stateless Koreans who were born and
live in Japan) [and a]{.underline} further [**sequence** of]{.underline}
coincident [events]{.underline} is necessary to [drive **escalation**
to]{.underline} the point of **[nuclear first use]{.underline}** by a
state. Also, the catalyst---the non-state actor--is almost assured of
discovery and destruction either during the attack itself (if it takes
the form of a nuclear suicide attack then self-immolation is assured) or
as a result of a search-and-destroy campaign from the targeted state
(unless the targeted government is annihilated by the initial terrorist
nuclear attack).

It follows that the effects of [a non-state nuclear attack may be
characterized better as a **trigger effect**, bringing about a
***cascade*** of nuclear use decisions within NC3 systems that shift
each state increasingly away from nuclear non-use and increasingly
towards nuclear use [by **releasing**]{.mark} **negative controls** and
enhancing positive [controls in]{.mark} **multiple
[action-reaction]{.mark} escalation [spirals]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(depending on how many nuclear armed states are party to an inter-state
conflict that is already underway at the time of the non-state nuclear
attack); [and]{.underline}/or by [inducing **concatenating nuclear
attacks** across geographically proximate nuclear weapons forces of
states already caught in the crossfire of nuclear threat or attacks of
their own making before a nuclear terrorist attack]{.underline}.\[17\]

An example of a cascading effect would be a non-state attack on a key
node of linked early warning systems that is unique to and critical for
strategic nuclear forces to be employable, or the effect of multiple,
coincident and erroneous sensor alerts of incoming attacks (as occurred
during the Cuban Missile Crisis with radar in Florida monitoring Soviet
missiles in Cuba that mistakenly fused an erroneous reading of a missile
trajectory with a real observation of a Soviet satellite that happened
to be passing overhead).

An example of a concatenating effect would an attack that leads a
nuclear weapons state to target two other states forces because it
cannot determine whose forces attacked its own. This circumstance might
arise if key anti-submarine forces or an aircraft carrier battle group
were attacked and it was impossible to determine in a given waterway or
area of ocean whose submarines were present or responsible for the
attack, leading the attacked state to destroy all the submarines
presenting on-going threat to its strategic forces.

As we noted above, a terrorist nuclear shock may take various forms and
appear in different places. Ever since an extortion attempt in Boston in
1974 based on the threat of nuclear detonation, the threat of an
improvised nuclear device has been credible. For such a threat to be
credible, a non-state terrorist entity must release a plausible
precursor such as nuclear material or warhead design information, or
stage an actual demonstration attack that makes it plausible that the
attacker controls a significant quantity of fissile material (most
likely plutonium, or simply radioactive materials suitable for a
radiological device that might be used to draw in first responders and
then detonate a warhead to maximize damage and terror). Such an attack
might be combined with a separate attack on critical infrastructure such
as a cyberattack. The attacker might retain sufficient material for
bargaining and insurance should the initial attack fail. Given the need
to adapt to circumstances, such an attacker is likely to be patient and
strategic, in the terms defined earlier, and to have extensive
organizational and communication capacities; and to be able to operate
at multiple targeted sites, possibly in multiple countries. Given its
patience and stamina, such [an [attacker]{.mark} would [select]{.mark} a
**highly [symbolic target]{.mark}** such as a **high level
meeting**]{.underline}. Such a case would present the targeted state
with an exquisite dilemma: bargaining and negotiation with the non-state
actor threatening such an attack may be justified given the explicit and
plausible nature of the threat, which may be politically impossible
while making counter-terrorism operations very risky and only possible
with extreme caution. [And]{.underline}, such an attacker might well
[issue a **false statement** about **state-sponsorship**]{.underline} to
invoke third parties in ways that vastly complicate the response to the
threat.

If the attacker is less capable and driven for immediate political or
other returns, then it may be satisfied with highly delegated delivery
with no recall option, and no use of communications to minimize the risk
of discovery or interdiction. Such an attacker is also less likely to
wait for the circumstances in which inter-state nuclear war is more
likely due to inter-state tension; and also less likely to seek third
party effects beyond the damage to the immediate target and resulting
terror. Should surveillance indicate that an improvised nuclear device
is in motion, then an all-out search to interdict the attackers and to
retrieve the device or materials would likely ensue.

In these two instances of credible threat of non-state nuclear attack,
the insider versus outsider perpetrator factor will affect significantly
how the attack affects possible inter-state conflicts. In Kobe's terms,
if the perpetrator is confirmed to be an outsider, then a
country-of-origin suspicion matrix may cast suspicion onto another state
as possible sponsor. For an attack threatened in China, the linkage
might be back to Russia, the United States, or North Korea. For an
attack threatened in Russia, the linkage might be back to the United
States, China, or North Korea. For an attack threatened in North Korea,
the linkage might be back to the United States, China, or Russia. And
for an attack threatened in one of the umbrella states in the region,
South Korea and Japan, such an attack might be linked to each other, as
well as to China, North Korea, or Russia. In each case, the shadow of
suspicion and possible accusations could tilt decision-making processes
in one or more of these states and ways that could worsen pre-existing
views about the nuclear use propensity of an opposing nuclear armed
state.

Should an actual nuclear attack occur, the situation is even more
complex and problematic. Such an attack might be purely accidental, due
to hardware, software, or human error while nuclear materials or weapons
are in transit. In principle, this limits the site of such an event to
the nuclear weapons states or their ships and aircraft as neither South
Korea nor Japan host nuclear weapons today. If an insider is involved,
then the perpetrator may be identified quickly, and whether there is a
linkage with another state may become evident (depending on nuclear
forensics as well as insight obtained from surviving attackers).

If an outsider is the perpetrator, then [the **suspicion matrix** will
come into play]{.underline} again, [with]{.underline} possibly [severe
effects on **inter-state tension** due to accusation, suspicion, and
fear of follow-on attacks]{.underline}. During the attack, especially if
it is a hostage-taking type of attack, [the identity of the perpetrator
may be]{.underline} unknown or **[ambiguous]{.underline}**, and
maintaining this ambiguity or even opacity as to the attacker may be
deliberate---as was the case with the 2008 Mumbai attack in which the
controller tried to ensure that all the attackers were killed in the
course of the twelve separate but coordinated attacks across the city
over four days. Although much progress has been made in establishing
local nuclear forensics capability in Japan,\[18\] China, and South
Korea, there is no certainty that it is sufficiently developed to
identify the perpetrator of an act of nuclear terrorism, especially if
there is a state sponsor and deception involved.

Conclusion

We now move to our conclusion. Nuclear-armed states can place themselves
on the edge of nuclear war by a combination of threatening force
deployments and threat rhetoric. Statements by US and North Korea's
leaders and supporting amplification by state and private media to
present just such a lethal combination. Many observers have observed
that the risk of war and nuclear war, in Korea and globally, have
increased in the last few years---although no-one can say with authority
by how much and exactly for what reasons.

However, states are restrained in their actual decisions to escalate to
conflict and/or nuclear war by conventional deterrence, vital national
interests, and other institutional and political restraints, both
domestic and international. It is not easy, in the real world, or even
in fiction, to start nuclear wars.\[19\] Rhetorical threats are standard
fare in realist and constructivist accounts of inter-state nuclear
deterrence, compellence, and reassurance, and are not cause for alarm
per se. States will manage the risk in each of the threat relationships
with other nuclear armed states to stay back from the brink, let alone
go over it, as they have in the past.

This argument was powerful and to many, persuasive during the Cold War
although it does not deny the hair-raising risks taken by nuclear armed
states during this period. Today, the multi-polarity of nine nuclear
weapons states interacting in a four-tiered nuclear threat system means
that the practice of sustaining nuclear threat and preparing for nuclear
war is no longer merely complicated, but is now enormously complex in
ways that may exceed the capacity of some and perhaps all states to
manage, even without the emergence of a fifth tier of non-state actors
to add further unpredictability to how this system works in practice.

The possibility that non-state actors may attack without advance warning
as to the time, place, and angle of attack presents another layer of
uncertainty to this complexity as to how inter-state nuclear war may
break out. That is, non-state actors with nuclear weapons or threat
goals and capacities do not seek the same goals, will not use the same
control systems, and will use radically different organizational
procedures and systems to deliver on their threats compared with nuclear
armed states. If used tactically for immediate terrorist effect, a
non-state nuclear terrorist could violently attack nuclear facilities,
exploiting any number of vulnerabilities in fuel cycle facility
security, or use actual nuclear materials and even warheads against
military or civilian targets. If a persistent, strategically oriented
nuclear terrorist succeed in gaining credible nuclear threat capacities,
it might take hostage one or more states or cities.

[If]{.underline} such [an event coincides with already high levels of
tension]{.underline} and even military collisions between the
non-nuclear forces of nuclear armed states, [then a non-state nuclear
terrorist [attack]{.mark} could [**impel** a **nuclear**]{.mark} **armed
[state]{.mark}** [to **escalate**]{.mark} its threat]{.underline} or
even military actions against other states, in the belief that this
targeted state may have sponsored the non-state attack, or was simply
the source of the attack, whatever the declared identity of the
attacking non-state entity. [[This]{.mark} outcome [could
**trigger**]{.mark}]{.underline} these states to go onto one or more of
the pathways to [**inadvertent** nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline},
especially if the terrorist attack was on a high value and high risk
nuclear facility or involved the seizure and/or use of fissile material.

[[Some]{.mark} experts [dismiss this]{.mark} possibility as so remote as
to be not worth worrying about. Yet the **[history]{.mark}** of nuclear
terrorism globally]{.underline} and in the Northeast Asian region
**[[suggests otherwise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Using the sand castle
metaphor, once built on the high tide line, sand castles may withstand
the wind but eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches the
castle---at least once, usually twice a day. Also, theories of
organizational and technological failure point to the coincidence of
multiple, relatively insignificant driving events that interact or
accumulate in ways that lead the "metasystem" to fail, even if each
individual component of a system works perfectly. Thus, the potential
catalytic effect of a nuclear terrorist incident is not that it would of
itself lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war; but that at a time of
crisis when alert levels are already high, when control systems on
nuclear forces have already shifted from primary emphasis on negative to
positive control, when decision making is already stressed, when the
potential for miscalculation is already high due to shows of force
indicating that first-use is nigh, when rhetorical threats promising
annihilation on the one hand, or collapse of morale and weakness on the
other invite counter-vailing threats by nuclear adversaries or their
allies to gain the upper hand in the "contest of resolve," and when
organizational cybernetics may be in play such that purposeful actions
are implemented differently than intended, then a terrorist nuclear
attack may shift a coincident combination of some or all of these
factors to a threshold level where they collectively lead to a first-use
decision by one or more nuclear-armed states. If the terrorist attack is
timed or happens to coincide with high levels of inter-state tension
involving nuclear-armed states, then some or all of these tendencies
will likely be in play anyway---precisely the concern of those who posit
pathways to inadvertent nuclear war as outlined in section 2 above.

Weapons in a Crisis." 2021.

Here\'s What You Need to Know: Obviously, under current circumstances,
[it's not in anyone's interests [for Japan to have nuclear
weapons]{.mark}. Still,]{.underline} it must be recognized that [if
pushed]{.underline}, **[it could certainly do so]{.underline}**.
Although a long ways off, all sides should remember that increasingly
strained relations between Japan, China, and Russia could make a bad
situation much, much worse. [It [is]{.mark} perhaps [China's **greatest
nightmare**]{.mark}]{.underline}: a nuclear-armed Japan. [Permanently
anchored off the Asian mainland]{.underline}, bristling with nuclear
weapons[, [a nuclear Japan would make China's]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[security [situation]{.mark} **much more [complex]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}]{.underline}than it is now, [and **[force China to
revise]{.mark} both [its]{.mark} [nuclear]{.mark} [doctrine]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} increase its nuclear [arsenal]{.mark}.**]{.underline} To be
perfectly clear, Japan has no intention of building nuclear weapons. In
fact, it has a strong aversion to nukes, having been the only country to
actually be on the receiving end of a nuclear strike on its cities.
Japan's strategic situation would have to grow very dire for it to
undertake such a drastic and expensive option. At the same time, China
has no interest in provoking Japan into building them. China's nuclear
"no first use" policy is in part aimed at reassuring Japan that, unless
it were attacked first with nuclear weapons, it will not use them in
wartime. Japan has no nukes, therefore, if China holds to its word,
Japan should be reassured. "If" and "should" being the operative words
here. Still, it's an interesting proposition. Nuclear phobias and the
lack of a pressing need aside, [there's]{.underline} **[certainly no
reason]{.underline}** why [Japan]{.underline},**[the third largest
economy in the world]{.underline}**, [couldn't build nukes.]{.underline}
What would a Japanese nuclear deterrent look like? Let's examine the
traditional nuclear triad of land-based ballistic missiles, strategic
bombers and ballistic missile submarines and each leg of the triad's
suitability for Japan's circumstance. For the sake of argument, let's
say Japan can choose just one leg to invest in. We'll also set the
number of nukes at roughly 300. Japan's high population density would
mean that the destruction of just a handful of cities could kill or
injure the majority of the country's civilian population. Against an
adversary such as Russia or China, Japan must be able to inflict similar
losses. [[Japan could invest in a small arsenal of land-based
missiles]{.underline},]{.mark} [each carrying]{.underline} **[one or
more nuclear warheads.]{.underline}** [The missiles could be stationed
in hardened silos,]{.underline} like the American Minuteman III, or on
mobile launchers like the Russian RS-24 Yars. A Japanese ICBM would be
smaller, not needing the range and fuel to reach North America. [[The
ability to **reach all of China, European Russia and the Middle
East**]{.mark} would be sufficient.]{.underline} Eventually, Japan might
settle on a force of 100 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, each
equipped with three 100 kiloton warheads. The missiles could be based in
hardened silos in eastern Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, or
moved around on mobile launchers. This is the least survivable of the
three ideas. [[Japan's]{.mark} **close [proximity to
China]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[means]{.mark} that in the event of a
nuclear attack]{.underline} from the latter [[it would need]{.mark} to
have a]{.underline} "[**[launch on warning]{.mark}" doctrine** to ensure
the missiles survived]{.underline}. [[That would]{.mark}]{.underline}
considerably [[increase]{.mark} [the possibility of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[accidental nuclear war,]{.mark}** [as a hardware or software
malfunction]{.mark}]{.underline} [in Japan's early warning system [could
be incorrectly interpreted as an attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Japan has]{.mark} tons of [bomb-grade plutonium]{.mark}]{.underline},
left over from its atomic-energy [program, [and could build]{.mark} a
small nuclear arsenal [**within a year.** South Korea **could do the
same**]{.mark} in]{.underline} perhaps [two]{.underline} years, and on
January 11, its president raised the possibility that his country might
need to "possess its own nukes." [Japan and South Korea now face nuclear
threats from North Korea and China]{.underline}. More than 70 percent of
South Koreans think their country should obtain nuclear weapons, and
Japan has decided to double the size of its military budget.
[[Taiwan]{.mark} could have its own nuclear weapons **[within a few
years]{.mark}** of deciding to build them. [Saudi Arabia could]{.mark}
also **[obtain them quickly.]{.mark}**]{.underline} At a conference in
Abu Dhabi this December, the Saudi foreign minister [made clear that "if
Iran gets an operational nuclear weapon, **all bets are
off."**]{.underline} And if [Saudi Arabia gets nuclear weapons, [Turkey,
Egypt, and Algeria]{.mark} might **[build them
soon]{.mark}**]{.underline} too.

On a number of occasions during the Cold War, the United States and the
Soviet Union came perilously close to a nuclear conflict that neither
side wanted---a conflict that could have killed hundreds of millions of
people. It is remarkable that no city has been destroyed by an atomic
blast since Nagasaki in 1945. [[The spread of]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark} to more countries, [amid]{.mark} today's rising

In a class of special cases, Taiwan is a particularly special one.
There's no evidence that it possesses or seeks to possess nuclear
weapons. There has been virtually no talk of Taiwan developing domestic
nuclear capabilities since the Taiwan Strait crisis of the mid-1990s.
But, as its prowess in chip manufacturing demonstrates,
[**[Taiwan]{.mark}** is highly technologically sophisticated. There's
**little doubt** that it **[could produce nuclear weapons]{.mark} if it
wished.**]{.underline} And, [as [China]{.mark} continues to [**stir up
nationalist zeal** and **bolster**]{.mark} **its [military]{.mark}
capabilities** [while]{.mark} the **[US turns]{.mark} its gaze
[inward]{.mark}**, Taiwan's [leaders]{.mark} may [conclude that]{.mark}
the **deterrent [value]{.mark}** [of strategic ambiguity has declined to
the point where it should **pursue** ]{.mark}**its own path towards
[nuclearisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}

As for **[[Finland]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the defensive wars it fought
against the Soviet Union have [**calcified** into a **[wari]{.mark}ness
[of Russian intentions.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It is not a member of
NATO or the EU, nor is it a party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons. True, Putin's invasion of Ukraine has pushed public
support for NATO membership to record highs. But that support may
subside. [[Finns cherish]{.mark} their [independence. They]{.mark} may
yet [conclude]{.mark} that acquiring [nuclear weapons is the **sole
means of preserving it.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a slightly speculative inclusion.
Indeed, it is today party to most relevant non-proliferation treaties
and agreements, including the Treaty of Bangkok. But it is also [poised
to be the first Southeast Asian state to **[generate its own nuclear
energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}---thanks in part to Russian assistance. It
[fought wars against China and the US within living memory]{.underline},
shares a 1,300-kilometre border with the former, and abstained from the
UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion. [Hanoi may
[decide]{.mark} that, despite its treaty commitments, [the **only way**
to]{.mark} truly [**guarantee its security** is **with its own nuclear
weapons.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

What about Australia? As recently as the late 1960s, Prime Minister John
Gorton wanted Australia to develop its own nuclear weapons. Despite
Australia signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1970 and being
under the implied protection of the US nuclear umbrella, today there's
occasional debate about Australia acquiring its own weapons (strong
recent pieces include one in the Australian Financial Review and another
in The Strategist).

Certainly, China's aggression is driving strategic competition in the
Indo-Pacific to new levels. But I'm not convinced that Canberra's
calculations have been altered substantially by Putin's invasion of
Ukraine. First, it's clear that the acquisition of nuclear submarines as
part of the AUKUS agreement is partly intended to enhance Australia's
powers of deterrence. Second, Australia's leaders are likely to conclude
that there's too much uncertainty about how Putin's invasion will
influence China's actions in the region. While it's true that the
government has sought to make national security an election issue, there
is no serious talk of developing our own nuclear weapons.

[The countries mentioned here are [likely to seek]{.mark} their security
by other, [non-nuclear means. But]{.mark} accumulate enough tiny
probabilities and you will be confronted by an event with a low to
**[medium probability of occurring.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Leaders
around the world may well have drawn the lesson that the seeds of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine were sown the day Kyiv willingly ceded its
nuclear weapons. After all, only the most ardent hawk today seriously
contemplates an invasion of North Korea.

[**[Even a 5% probability]{.mark}** that a new member will join the
nuclear club]{.underline}---or even signal a desire to do
so---**[[should alter]{.mark} strategic
[calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Washington, Beijing, Moscow,
Brussels and Canberra. [When the **[stakes]{.mark} are [so
high]{.mark}**, **even [a small possibility]{.mark}** of a more
multipolar nuclear order is **[worth taking
seriously.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Multipolar market lowers barriers to acquisition

Won't the great powers step in? Wouldn't the United States and other
countries interested in stopping proliferation block Riyadh's access to
sensitive nuclear transfers, such as enrichment technology? It's
possible Saudi Arabia will be unable to acquire or develop the
wherewithal for a nuclear weapon. But [[the nuclear market is
changing]{.mark} in ways that facilitate proliferation. There's been a
shift [from a unipolar world]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the United
States as the dominant power, [[to]{.mark} a world of [several great
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, or multipolarity. Since 1975, [[the key
instrument for curbing]{.mark} nuclear [transfers has been the supplier
cartel]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG),
created by the United States in cooperation with the Soviets. [The NSG
forced suppliers to act in unison and incorporate the same
guidelines]{.underline} into their individual nuclear export policies,
restricting the sale of ENR and thus stemming proliferation. [Here's the
catch: [The NSG's ability to regulate supplier behavior depends
on]{.mark} how many [great powers]{.mark} are in the system]{.underline}
and whether they agree to work together to limit proliferation. The
emerging multipolar world and the growing rivalry among the United
States, Russia and China is likely to weaken the NSG's effectiveness.
This could crack open the door [to [renewed supplier competition and
broader access]{.mark} to sensitive nuclear technologies. And this [lets
countries interested in acquiring nuclear transfers]{.mark}, such as
Saudi Arabia[, pit suppliers against each other and secure better
products]{.mark}, lower prices [and **more advantageous terms of
use.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

When the Cold War ended in 1990 and new regional threats arose, several
of the nonnuclear weapon nations began reconsidering their earlier
decisions to reject nuclear weapons. [The [potential for]{.mark}
**widespread nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} certainly
[[existed]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2006, for example, Mohamed ElBaradei,
then [**[director]{.mark} general [of the IAEA]{.mark}**,
estimated]{.underline} that as many as **[[forty-nine]{.mark} nonnuclear
weapons [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[possess]{.mark}ed **the
technical [knowledge]{.mark}** [to make **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}** [and warned]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**global or
regional [tensions]{.mark}** [might]{.mark} persuade some to
**[launch]{.mark} such [programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unquestionably,
what German physicist Werner Heisenberg warned in 1947 had come to pass:
[the [making]{.mark} of atomic [bombs was "no longer **a problem of
science** in any country, but]{.mark} **a problem of
[engineering]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline} Mitchell Reiss amplified
Heisenberg's warning by pointing out in The Nuclear Tipping Point that
["[**the building blocks** for **a nuclear arsenal**]{.mark} \-- **the
scientific** and **engineering [expertise]{.mark}**, **precision machine
[tools]{.mark}**, **computer [software]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **nuclear
[design]{.mark} information** \-- [are]{.mark} **more [readily
available]{.mark}** than **ever before**."]{.underline} Reiss and his
colleagues argued states that adopted a "hedging strategy," which
permits them to gradually acquire nuclear competence, posed the most
serious threat to non-proliferation. [**A nuclear ["tipping
point"]{.mark}** would [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}, they claim,
[[once]{.underline}]{.mark} several [[states make **the**]{.mark}
**political [decision]{.mark}** [to acquire **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **the means of [delivery]{.mark}**[.
This could create **a prolif**]{.mark}**eration

[Following the conclusion of World War II]{.underline},
[Japan]{.underline} has managed to **[establish itself]{.underline}**
[as a pacifist leader]{.underline} after an extensive history of
belligerence.56 [As a result of its **internationally-renowned
reputation**]{.underline} [as a **pacifist, non-nuclear
state,**]{.underline} [[Japan]{.mark}ese nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[spur]{.mark} a [worldwide
reevaluation]{.mark} of the international threat
environment**]{.underline} and Japan's idiosyncratic position within it.
During the process of reevaluating the international threat environment,
[[global frameworks]{.mark} of non-proliferation]{.underline} --- such
as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons --- [would
likely be]{.underline} **[[overturned]{.underline}]{.mark}** a[s
membership deteriorates]{.underline}. [Without a physical
framework]{.underline} of non-proliferation [and the associated
**symbolic loss of Japan**]{.underline} [as a non-nuclear
power]{.underline}, [the probable [outcome would be]{.mark}
a]{.underline} **["[domino effect]{.mark}" of widespread
nuclearization]{.underline}** [that would **[contribute to]{.mark} an
increasingly [volatile global security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [landscape
and ideologically]{.underline} [strengthen unorthodox acts of
proliferation]{.underline}. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons [The]{.underline} Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons ([NPT]{.underline}) [may not]{.underline} be a domestic,
[legally-binding]{.underline} agreement, [but Japan has been
a]{.underline} **[devoted proponent]{.underline}** [of and]{.underline}
**[adherent]{.underline}** [to its core values]{.underline}; therefore,
as a consequence of Japan's potential proliferation, [the NPT would lose
a]{.underline} **[foundational member]{.underline}**, [thus **reducing
the efficacy**]{.underline} [of the treaty itself.]{.underline} Despite
Japan's contemporary dedication to the NPT, the Diet's ratification was
delayed until 8 July 1976 --- six years following the signing of the
treaty --- after a series of intense debates over Japan's right to have
a 'free-hand on nuclear devices' (Endicott 1977, 278). The ability of
Japan to remove its 'free-hand on nuclear devices' and democratically
decide its fate regarding such a contentious subject in and of itself
demonstrates its true commitment to both the NPT as an entity and the
general concept of non-proliferation itself. If Japan were to have
faltered ideologically, it is logical to assume that they may have
either protracted or prevented the domestic ratification of the NPT
altogether. Additionally, with --- at the time --- such a diverse diet
(both in the Upper and Lower Houses), partisan compromise indicated the
visible importance of nuclear non-proliferation to Japan (Endicott 1977,
275--76). Although the NPT is adhered to by a majority of the world's
countries, it contains an article, Article X, which specifies that each
party of the NPT maintains its sovereign right to withdraw from the
treaty at any time given irregular circumstances (United Nations, n.d.).
Essentially, this article renders the treaty non-binding, and its
legitimacy is upheld by the membership of its constituents. Japan, as a
visible proponent of non-proliferation and a non-nuclear state, serves
as one of the major anchors for the non-nuclear constituents of the NPT.
If Japan were to sever its commitment to the NPT as a previous proponent
of non-proliferation, it would concurrently be severing its commitment
to non-proliferation as a whole[.]{.underline} Violation of Japanese
Pacifism and The Ideological Ramifications of Proliferation Even when
possessing nuclear potential, Japan has maintained a steadfast
commitment to pacifism --- a decision that would further exacerbate the
global response to Japan's hypocrisy in the event of its proliferation.
In 1963, the US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, reckoned that 20
nations had the ability to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970s
--- Japan included (Davenport 2019, 2--3). McNamara's estimate involving
Japan, later researched in 1994, was proven correct. As uncovered and
subsequently reported by the Asahi Shimbun, Japanese scholars ---
recruited by the Cabinet Research Office --- had confirmed that Japan
was entirely capable of constructing nuclear weapons during the 1960s;
however, it was also uncovered that the construction was rendered
improbable due to "political and other reasons" (Kurosaki 2017, 47).7
Unlike many countries intent on developing robust nuclear programs and
not possessing the appropriate resources to do so, Japan holds the
opposite set of traits. Its ability to proliferate --- in and of itself
--- should be a cause for concern in the international community, yet
Japan mitigates this concern through its practice of restraint and its
national commitment to serve as a model for the rest of the world\'s
non-proliferation efforts. The "political reasons" mentioned by the
Asahi Shimbun are inherent to the modern Japanese political structure.
Explicitly outlined in the Constitution of Japan (and discussed in
greater detail in Chapter IV), Article 9 serves as a direct legal
barrier to Japanese proliferation. Additionally, further symbolic
statements by influential political figures, such as former PM Eisaku
Sato's Three Non-Nuclear Principles and reiterations by former PMs Naoto
Kan and Yoshihiko Noda have assured both domestic and foreign entities
that proliferation countervails the very fabric of the modern Japanese
society (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, n.d. (B)). [In the event
of Japanese proliferation, [Japan]{.mark} would
[lose]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[any]{.mark} semblance of
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a benchmark for the
non-proliferation movement]{.underline}, [[and **the**]{.mark} **durable
[restraint of Japan as a motivator]{.mark}** for other countries'
non-proliferation regimes]{.underline} **[[would
disappear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[When a role model goes against
the]{.mark} very [idea that it supported]{.mark}]{.underline} and
valued, [[it will]{.mark} both]{.underline} **[[lose]{.mark} its
[adherents]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[disenfranchise
the ideology itself.]{.underline}** [Japan is an]{.underline} [exemplar
of advocating for and upholding non-proliferation]{.underline}, [and if
it is not possible for Japan to remain in said position, **it is
unlikely** that another]{.underline}, **[less qualified]{.underline}**
[country will **thereafter be able to inherit it**]{.underline}. The
environment that [this would produce]{.underline} is that of
**[ideological anarchy surrounding non-proliferation]{.underline}**.
With their benchmark defunct, [[countries would]{.underline} **[no
longer feel obligated]{.underline}**]{.mark}, even on an informal basis,
[to practice restraint]{.underline} with regard to the production of
nuclear weapons.8 The East Asian Disequilibrium With the NPT rapidly
disintegrating and the ideology of non-proliferation in a state of
disrepair, [Japan's immediate neighbors]{.underline} **[would be the
first to suffer]{.underline}** from its proliferation. As it stands,
[Japan, South Korea]{.underline} (ROK)[, and Taiwan]{.underline} (ROC)
[do not possess nuclear weapons]{.underline} despite their neighbors,
North Korea (DPRK) and China (PRC), possessing them. Rather, the nuclear
umbrella under which Japan and the ROK exist provides a counterbalance
to the nuclear capabilities of the DPRK and the PRC.9 [Japan's
acquisition]{.underline} of nuclear weapons **[would entirely confound
this delicate balance.]{.underline}** On the side of Japan's allies,
[the [ROK and ROC]{.mark} may [perceive]{.mark} a [nuclearized
Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as a **threat**]{.mark} **to their own
sovereignties**]{.underline} [both directly and through the threat of
nuclear escalation]{.underline} [with their neighbors]{.underline} (the
DPRK and PRC), and [they **may [attempt to match]{.mark} Japan's
proliferation**]{.underline} with their own campaigns of nuclear
procurement. Presently, [the President of the R]{.underline}epublic
[o]{.underline}f [K]{.underline}orea, Yoon Suk-yeol [has]{.underline}
**[already expressed]{.underline}** [his willingness to begin the
development of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and --- due to this
existing willingness to proliferate --- [[Japan's prolif]{.mark}eration
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} **[likely [serve as the
catalyst]{.mark}]{.underline}** [for the ROK's proprietary
development]{.underline} of nuclear weapons (Herzog and Sukin 2023).
Regarding [the ROC, the situation would be less dire on account of
President Tsai Ing-wen's staunchly anti-nuclear views]{.underline};
nevertheless, [as]{.underline} [non-proliferation loses its legitimacy
and the ROC **gains exposure to new regional threats, this attitude
would likely change**]{.underline} (AP News 2019). [For Japan's nuclear
neighbors]{.underline}, with whom relations exist in a precarious state,
[its nuclear proliferation]{.underline} [may give reason [for]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[procurement of increasingly powerful nuclear
arsenals]{.underline}** [in an attempt to]{.underline} **[preempt a
potential strike]{.underline}** [from Japan and]{.underline}
'[rebalance' the nuclear ecosystem.]{.underline} With both effects in
mind, **[an [arms race among]{.mark} a [nuclearized East
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would occur]{.underline} at a minimum, and
--- in the worst case --- [the nuclear arms race]{.underline}
[originating in East Asia]{.underline} **[would spread sequentially from
country to country]{.underline}** [in a centrifugal manner.]{.underline}
The Delusion of Nuclear Security: India and Pakistan Despite its
theoretical basis, a similar scenario to that which was previously
mentioned has already materialized, and although historical events are
not necessarily indicative of the future, they can provide an apt
warning. If Japan were to consider proliferating with the pretense of
bolstering security, a careful analysis of India and Pakistan may serve
as an appropriate deterrent. Upon splitting into two separate states,
India and Pakistan have remained in a nearly constant state of conflict.
Even prior to India's incipient nuclear test in 1974, the two states had
already undergone three conventional conflicts (Hashim 2019). With the
acquisition of nuclear weapons, it could have been reasonably assumed
that conflicts --- particularly conventional conflicts --- between India
and Pakistan would have ceased, yet periodic clashes in the Kashmir
region continued to occur throughout the latter quarter of the 20th
century (Hashim 2019). It is, however, possible to argue that conflict
persisted due to the absence of nuclear weapons in Pakistan until 1998,
which in theory would have eliminated the threat of conflict due to
mutually assured destruction (MAD). From a normative viewpoint and with
consideration of MAD, 1998 should have been the year in which conflict
between India and Pakistan ceased, yet Pakistan's proliferation proved
only to escalate conflict between the two states with the eruption of
the Kargil conflict in the Kashmir region during the same year. Japan
may exist in a unique situation that currently bears little resemblance
to that between India and Pakistan; however, if proliferation were to
occur, it may find itself bridging said gap. In such an event, [Japan
would]{.underline} [**occupy the position of the first domino in a large
series.** By attempting to improve its own security]{.underline} through
nuclear sovereignty, [a paradoxical effect would transpire.]{.underline}
Much like Pakistan's response to India's proliferation, [Japan's
proliferation]{.underline} [would]{.underline} **[inflame the regional
security environment]{.underline}**, [and, as other countries become
threatened]{.underline} by Japan's proliferation, [they may seek to
improve their security]{.underline} through the construction of their
own arsenals, **[thus causing further inflammation]{.underline}**. [As
demonstrated in India and Pakistan, human conflict]{.underline} ---
through the age of nuclear weapons --- has persisted, and
[proliferation]{.underline} merely [serves]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[augment the potential severity of armed conflict, not to deter
it.]{.underline}** Japanese Proliferation and Revolutionary States: The
Case of Iran As previously stated, Japan's proliferation would likely
lead to the sequential centrifugal formation of nuclear states, and ---
while East Asia was explicitly mentioned previously --- proliferation is
not limited to Japan's immediate vicinity; rather, due to the
international scope of the non-proliferation regime through the NPT, the
nuclear domino effect would have an international reach. While certain
states may not pose a significant threat as a result of a limited
nuclear arsenal or general nuclear abstention in the event of Japanese
proliferation, other states may pose a unique threat, and a floated set
of standards for nuclear etiquette could arise. [With the desertion of
one of the NPT's core members, the legitimacy of non-proliferation
**would exist in a gray area**]{.underline}, [and the enforcement of the
NPT's]{.underline} consequences for proliferation [would largely rely on
the international community's responses]{.underline} to acts of
proliferation10 . If Japan were to face international sanctions, it
would suffer economically, yet it would still possess nuclear weapons.
[For revolutionary states --- such as **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
upon whom sanctions have already been placed, their non-nuclear status
would be suboptimal. As it stands, the United States currently has
extensive sanctions placed on Iran that span over numerous industries
with merely a remote link to the Iranian nuclear energy program (Nada et
al. 2023). While this may serve to reduce the scale of Iran's nuclear
capabilities, it employs a great deal of American leverage. Since the
United States has levied so many sanctions thus far, Iran's marginal
loss from additional sanctions would be greatly reduced. That being
said, Iran has already borne a large portion of international sanctions
without possessing nuclear weapons; therefore, the United States and its
other allies, in an effort to materially stunt Iran's nuclear program,
would not be able to do so effectively as a result of their diminished
level of influence. [Combined with the hypocrisy of a supposedly
pacifist nation's decision to proliferate, Iran --- and other
revolutionary states --- [would have]{.mark} **both logical and
ideological [pretenses to pursue]{.mark} the development of
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The **domino
effect**]{.mark}, however, [is not]{.mark} entirely [confined]{.mark} to
the revolutionary states themselves]{.underline}. [Given the upended
condition of non-proliferation]{.underline} as an ideology and the
presence of the aforementioned \'gray area\', **[any type of
proliferation]{.underline}** [would not have the potential to be easily
contested.]{.underline} Connected with the limited marginal loss from
sanctions, [revolutionary states would have little in the way of
providing nuclear weapons to ideologically aligned terrorist states or
organizations.]{.underline} Namely, Iran's continuous support of
designated terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah could produce said
issues in the event of Iran's reactive proliferation (Grace and
Mandelbaum 2006).11 As a major opponent of the Israeli state, a
potential nuclear power, Hezbollah's acquisition of nuclear weapons from
Iran would likely heighten regional tensions and lead to even more
clashes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Further clashes with Israel
would introduce the possibility of American intervention as a result of
Israel's diplomatic ties with the United States. Additionally, [as
terrorist states lack overt state affiliation]{.underline}, [the danger
of nuclear attacks with]{.underline} **[limited retaliatory
potential]{.underline}** [would have a marked increase]{.underline}. [As
this danger increases]{.underline}, [non-nuclear countries would
have]{.underline} **[less of a reason to retain such bounded security
capabilities]{.underline}**, [thus further augmenting the potential
scale of proliferation.]{.underline} Conclusion [Japan's proliferation
would]{.underline} --- as demonstrated --- [have consequences that could
exceed initial projections.]{.underline} **[Resembling [a sinking
ship]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the [holes in]{.mark} the ideology of
[non-prolif]{.mark}eration as a result of Japan's potential
proliferation]{.underline} **[[would]{.mark} greatly
[outnumber]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the [states attempting to maintain
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Once this]{.mark} symbolic [ship has sunk,
there would be nothing preventing]{.mark} the [complete]{.mark}
ideological dissolution]{.underline}** [of an often underappreciated
security measure]{.underline}, [and the global geopolitical environment
may enter **an era of [nuclear disarray]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Further Proliferation

[Nuclear proliferation]{.underline} poses an additional threat to
international peace and security because it [causes **further
proliferation**. [As]{.mark} former [Secretary]{.mark} of State George
[Schultz]{.mark} **once [said]{.mark}**, '[prolif]{.mark}eration
[begets]{.mark} [prolif]{.mark}eration']{.underline}65 [When one country
acquires nuclear weapons, its **regional [adversaries]{.mark}**, feeling
threatened by its neighbor's **new nuclear capabilities**, [are **more
likely**]{.mark}]{.underline} to attempt [[to acquire
**nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in response.
Indeed, [the [history]{.mark} of nuclear proliferation [can be read
as]{.mark} **one long [chain reaction]{.mark} of
proliferation**]{.underline}.

Of course, [reactive proliferation does **not always
occur**]{.underline}. In the early 1960s, for example, US officials
worried that a nuclear-armed China would cause Taiwan, Japan, India,
Pakistan, and other states to acquire nuclear weapons.66 In hindsight,
we now know that they were correct in some cases, but wrong in others.
Using statistical analysis, Philipp Bleek has shown that reactive
proliferation is not automatic, but that rather, states are more likely
to proliferate in response to neighbors when three conditions are met
(1) there is an intense security rivalry between the two countries, (2)
the potential proliferant state does not have a security guarantee from
a nuclear-armed patron (3) and the potential proliferant state has the
industrial and technical capacity to launch an indigenous nuclear
program.67 In other words, [**[reactive prolif]{.mark}eration** [is
**real**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but conditional. To be sure, as Barry
Posen has argued, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey all have primitive
nuclear infrastructures and it would be difficult for any of them to
build nuclear weapons overnight.68 In addition, Turkey is a member of
NATO and Saudi Arabia enjoys a close security partnership with the
United States and these states might prefer to lounge in the shade of
America's nuclear umbrella rather than build independent arsenals. On
the other hand, one or more of these states, much like the United
Kingdom and France in the early days of the Cold War, might decide that
America's nuclear protection is insufficient. With a decade's worth of
dedicated nuclear development, any of these states could conceivably
become nuclear powers. Just because reactive proliferation takes time,
does not mean that it is not a problem. If Iran enters the nuclear club,
therefore, it is likely that some, but not all, of the countries that we
currently worry about will eventually become nuclear powers.

We should worry about the spread of nuclear weapons in every case,
therefore, because the problem will likely extend beyond that specific
case. As Wohlstetter cautioned decades ago, [[prolif]{.mark}eration [is
**an N+1 problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}.69

In sum, [[nucl]{.mark}ear [prolif]{.mark}eration [gives us]{.mark}
**many [reasons]{.mark}** to [fear]{.mark} **the [spread of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to **additional
states**]{.mark}. While it is important not to exaggerate **the above
threats**, it would be **an even greater sin** to **underestimate** them
and]{.underline}, as a result, [not take the steps **necessary** to
combat the spread of the world's **most dangerous

Further proliferation. [Nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration poses an
additional threat to international peace and security because it [causes
**further prolif**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}. As former Secretary

[**adversaries**, feeling threatened]{.mark} by its neighbor's new

to **[acquire]{.mark}** nuclear weapons in response]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the [history]{.mark} of nuclear proliferation [can be read as a
**chain**]{.mark} **[reaction]{.mark}** of proliferation]{.underline}.
[The United States acquired nuclear weapons in response to Nazi
Germany's crash nuclear program]{.underline}. [The Soviet Union and
China acquired nuclear weapons to counter the U.S. nuclear arsenal. The
United Kingdom and France went nuclear to protect themselves from the
Soviet Union. India's bomb was meant to counter China and it, in turn,
spurred Pakistan to join the nuclear club]{.underline}. Today, we worry
that, [if Iran acquires nuclear weapons,]{.underline} [other Middle
Eastern countries]{.underline}, [such as Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, and Saudi
Arabia, might desire nuclear capabilities]{.underline}, [triggering an
arms race]{.underline} in a strategically important and volatile region.
[Of course, reactive proliferation does not always occur]{.underline}.
In the early 1960s, for example, U.S. officials worried that a
nuclear-armed China would cause Taiwan, Japan, India, Pakistan, and
other states to acquire nuclear weapons.[^2]\[70\] In hindsight, we now

become nuclear powers. We should worry about the spread of nuclear

beyond that specific case. As Wohlstetter cautioned decades ago,
proliferation is not an N problem, but an N+1 problem. Further nuclear
proliferation is not necessarily a problem, of course, if the spread of
nuclear weapons is irrelevant or even good for international politics as
obsessionists and optimists protest. But, as the above discussion makes
clear, [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration, and the further nuclear
proliferation it causes, [increases the risk of **nuclear war**]{.mark}
and nuclear terrorism, emboldens nuclear-armed states to be more
aggressive, threatens regional]{.underline} [stability, constrains U.S.
freedom of action, and weakens America's alliance relationships, [giving
us]{.mark} all good [reason to **fear the spread** of]{.mark} nuclear

Proliferation through Rose-Colored Glasses

The **[proliferation optimist]{.underline}** position has a
distinguished pedigree, and provides a useful rationale for actors
interested in developing strategic deterrence with limited means, but it
[provides a **weaker intellectual framework**]{.underline} for
comprehensively understanding the likely effects of nuclear
proliferation on international politics.

Scott [Sagan and]{.underline} other contemporary **[proliferation
pessimists]{.underline}** have [provided **systematic** and]{.underline}
**[thoroughgoing critiques]{.underline}** of the proliferation optimism
position.31 Sagan shows that [the spread of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s
leads to]{.mark} **greater levels** of **international
[instability]{.mark}** [because: states]{.mark} might [conduct
**preventive strikes** on]{.mark} the **nuclear [facilities]{.mark}** of
**proliferant states**, **proliferant [states]{.mark}** [might
not]{.mark} take **the necessary** steps to [build]{.mark} **a secure**,
**[second-strike]{.mark} capability**, [and **organizational
pathologies**]{.mark}]{.underline} [within nuclear states could [lead
to]{.mark} **[accidental]{.mark} or inadvertent nuclear
[launch]{.mark}**]{.underline}.32 As Frank Gavin writes in his review of
the optimism/pessimism debate, 'The real problem, however, is that Sagan
plays small ball in his debate with Waltz, conceding the big issues. Why
not challenge Waltz on his core arguments about deterrence and
stability?'33 Rather than repeat the substantial efforts of previous
pessimists, therefore, I will take up Gavin's challenge and focus on
three big issues. In particular, this section maintains that
[proliferation [optimists: present an **oversimplified**]{.mark}
**version** of **nuclear [deterrence theory]{.mark}**[, follow]{.mark} a
line of [argumentation that contains]{.mark} **an internal logical
[contradiction]{.mark}**, and do not address the concerns of **US
foreign policymakers**]{.underline}.

#### They are mistaken about deterrence theory.

**Kroenig 15** \-- Matthew Kroenig, International Relations Professor
and Chair at Georgetown University. \[The History of Proliferation
Optimism: Does It Have a Future? 38(1-2), Taylor & Francis\]

First and foremost, [proliferation optimists present **an oversimplified
view** of nuclear deterrence]{.underline} theory. Optimists argue that
since the advent of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), any nuclear war
would mean national suicide and, therefore, no rational leader would
ever choose to start one. Furthermore, they argue that the requirements
for rationality are not high. Rather, leaders must value their own
survival and the survival of their nation and understand that
intentionally launching a nuclear war would threaten those values. Many
analysts and policymakers attempt to challenge the optimists on their
own turf and question whether the leaders of potential proliferant
states are fully rational.34

Yet, [these debates overlook]{.underline} the fact [that]{.underline},
apart from the optimists, [**[leading]{.mark} nuclear deterrence
[theorists]{.mark}** [believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration contributes to **a real [risk]{.mark} of**
nuclear [war]{.mark} **even [in]{.mark}** a situation of [MAD]{.mark}
among **rational states**]{.underline}.35 Moreover,
[realizing]{.underline} that [nuclear war is possible does not depend on
**peculiar beliefs** about **the possibility** of **escaping
MAD**]{.underline}.36 Rather, as we will discuss below, these theorists
understand that some risk of nuclear war is necessary in order for
deterrence to function. To be sure, in the 1940s, Viner, Brodie, and
others argued that MAD rendered war among major powers obsolete, but
nuclear deterrence theory soon advanced beyond that simple
understanding.37 After all, great power political competition does not
end with nuclear weapons. And nuclear-armed states still seek to
threaten nuclear-armed adversaries. States cannot credibly threaten to
launch a suicidal nuclear war, but they still want to coerce their
adversaries. This leads to a credibility problem: how can states
credibly threaten a nuclear-armed opponent? Since the 1960s, academic
nuclear deterrence theory has been devoted almost exclusively to
answering this question.38 And their answers do not give us reasons to
be optimistic.

Thomas Schelling was the first to devise a rational means by which
states can threaten nuclear-armed opponents.39 He argued that leaders
cannot credibly threaten to intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war,
but they can make a 'threat that leaves something to chance'.40 They can
engage in a process, the **[nuclear crisis]{.underline}**, which
[increases the risk of **nuclear war**]{.underline} in an attempt [to
force a **less resolved adversary** to back down. As states escalate **a
nuclear crisis** there is **an increasing probability**]{.underline}
that [the conflict will **spiral out of control** and result
in]{.underline} an inadvertent or accidental **[nuclear
exchange]{.underline}**. As long as the benefit of winning the crisis is
greater than the incremental increase in the risk of nuclear war,
however, threats to escalate nuclear crises are inherently credible. In
these games of nuclear brinkmanship, the state that is willing to run
the greatest risk of nuclear war before backing down will win the
crisis, as long as it does not end in catastrophe. It is for this reason
that Thomas Schelling called great power politics in the nuclear era a
'competition in risk taking'.41 This does not mean that states eagerly
bid up the risk of nuclear war. Rather, they face gut-wrenching
decisions at each stage of the crisis. They can quit the crisis to avoid
nuclear war, but only by ceding an important geopolitical issue to an
opponent. Or they can the escalate the crisis in an attempt to prevail,
but only at the risk of suffering a possible nuclear exchange.

Since 1945 [[there]{.underline}]{.mark} were [[have been **20**]{.mark}
**high stakes nuclear [crises]{.mark}** [in which **'rational'
states**]{.mark}]{.underline} like the United States [run **a
frighteningly-real [risk]{.mark} of nuclear
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.42 By asking whether states can be deterred,
therefore, proliferation optimists are asking the wrong question. The
right question to ask is: what risk of nuclear war is a specific state
willing to run against a particular opponent in a given crisis?
Optimists are likely correct when they assert that a nuclear-armed Iran
will not intentionally commit national suicide by launching a
bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack on the United States or Israel. This
does not mean that Iran will never use nuclear weapons, however. Indeed,
it is almost inconceivable to think that a nuclear-armed Iran would not,
at some point, find itself in a crisis with another nuclear-armed power.
It is also inconceivable that in those circumstances, Iran would not be
willing to run some risk of nuclear war in order to achieve its
objectives. If a nuclear-armed Iran and the United States or Israel were
to have a geopolitical conflict in the future, over the internal
politics of Syria, an Israeli conflict with Iran's client Hizballah, the
US presence in the Persian Gulf, shipping through the Strait of Hormuz,
or some other issue, do we believe that Iran would immediately
capitulate? Or is it possible that Iran would push back, possibly
brandishing nuclear weapons in an attempt to coerce its adversaries? If
the latter, there is a risk that proliferation to Iran could result in
nuclear war and proliferation optimists are wrong to dismiss it out of
hand.

An optimist might counter that nuclear weapons will never be used, even
in a crisis situation, because states have such a strong incentive,
namely national survival, to ensure that nuclear weapons are not used.
But this objection ignores the fact that [leaders operate under
**competing pressures**. Leaders in nuclear-armed
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[have]{.mark} **strong
[incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to convince]{.mark} their
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s might
be used]{.mark}. **Historically** [we have seen]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[leaders]{.mark} take [actions in crises]{.mark}]{.underline},
such as [[placing]{.mark} nuclear [weapons on **high alert** and
delegating]{.mark} **nuclear launch [authority]{.mark}** [to
**low**]{.mark}**-level [commanders]{.mark}**[, to]{.mark} **purposely
[increase]{.mark}** the risk of [nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} in an attempt to force less-resolved opponents
to back down.

Moreover, not even the optimists' first principles about the irrelevance
of nuclear posture stand up to scrutiny. Not all nuclear wars would be
equally devastating.43 Any nuclear exchange would have devastating
consequences no doubt, but, if a crisis were to spiral out of control
and result in nuclear war, any sane leader would rather face a country
with five nuclear weapons than one with 5,000. Similarly, any sane
leader would be willing to run a greater risk of nuclear war against the
former state than against the latter. Indeed, scholars have demonstrated
that states are willing to run greater risks and are, therefore, more
likely to win nuclear crises when they enjoy nuclear superiority over
their opponents.44 [Proliferation optimists might be
correct]{.underline} that [[no]{.mark} rational [leader would
choose]{.mark}]{.underline} to launch [**a [suicid]{.mark}al nuclear
war**, [but]{.mark}]{.underline}, depending on the context,
[**[any]{.mark} sane [leader]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
almost [**[certainly]{.mark}** be willing to [risk
one]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nuclear deterrence theorists have also proposed [a second scenario under
which rational leaders]{.underline} would be willing to [instigate a
nuclear exchange: **limited nuclear war**]{.underline}.45 For example,
by launching a single nuclear weapon against a small city, a
nuclear-armed state could signal its willingness to escalate a crisis,
while leaving its adversary with enough left to lose to deter the
adversary from launching a full-scale nuclear response. In a future
crisis between China and the United States, for example, China could
choose to launch a nuclear strike on a US military base in East Asia to
demonstrate its seriousness. In that situation, with the continental
United States intact, would Washington choose to launch a full-scale
nuclear war on China that could result in the destruction of many
American cities? Or would it back down? China might decide to strike
after calculating that Washington would prefer a humiliating retreat
over a full-scale nuclear war. If launching a limited nuclear war could
be a rational strategic move under certain circumstances, it then
follows that the spread of nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear
use. To be sure, some strategic thinkers, including Henry Kissinger,
advocated limited nuclear war as a viable strategy only to recant the
position later due to fears of uncontrollable escalation. Yet, this does
not change the fact that [**leading nuclear deterrence theorists**
maintain]{.underline} that [**[limited]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**
[is possible among]{.mark} **rational [leaders]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} **a
[MAD]{.mark} world**]{.underline}.46

In sum, [proliferation [optimists present **an oversimplified**]{.mark}
**conception** of **nuclear [deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} theory.
[**Leading academic deterrence theorists** maintain]{.underline} that
[the spread of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} could [lead to]{.mark}
**nuclear use** in **[games of]{.mark} nuclear [brinkmanship]{.mark}**
and [through]{.mark} the exercise of **[limited]{.mark}** nuclear
[options]{.mark}]{.underline} [**even [among]{.mark}** [rational leaders
in]{.mark} **a situation of [MAD]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, they
understand that a risk of nuclear war is necessary in order for nuclear
deterrence to function, which leads us to our next point.

#### 4. It's a contradiction.

**Kroenig 15** \-- Matthew Kroenig, International Relations Professor
and Chair at Georgetown University. \[The History of Proliferation
Optimism: Does It Have a Future? 38(1-2), Taylor & Francis\]

The second weakness in [the proliferation optimist
[argument]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it [[rests on]{.mark} **an
internal logical [contradiction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This might come
as a surprise to some, given that optimists are sometimes portrayed as
hard-headed thinkers, following their premises to their logical
conclusions. But, the contradiction at the heart of the optimist
argument is glaring and simple to understand: [**[either]{.mark}** the
[probability of nuc]{.mark}lear [war is **zero**, or]{.mark} it is
**[nonzero]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but [it can[not]{.mark} be [**both**.
If]{.mark} the [probability]{.mark} of nuclear war [is **zero**, then
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s should have **no deterrent**]{.mark}
**effect**]{.underline}. States will not be deterred by a nuclear war
that could never occur and states should be willing to intentionally
launch large-scale conventional wars against nuclear-armed states. In
this case, proliferation optimists cannot conclude that the spread of
nuclear weapons is stabilizing.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [the probability of
nuclear war is [**nonzero**, then]{.mark} there is **a real
[danger]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [the spread of [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} will [result in]{.mark} **a [catastrophic]{.mark}
nuclear [war]{.mark}**. In this case, proliferation optimists cannot
conclude that nuclear weapons will **never be used**]{.underline}. This
is true whether the risk of nuclear war is exogenous or endogenous to
the behavior of the actors involved; the probability of nuclear war
simply cannot be both zero and nonzero.

In sum, [**[either]{.mark}** the [spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons
**[raises]{.mark}** the [risk of nuclear]{.mark} [war
and]{.mark}]{.underline}, in so doing, [[deters]{.underline}]{.mark}
large-scale [[**conventional conflict**. Or th]{.mark}ere is **[no
danger]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [nuclear weapons will **[ever]{.mark}
be [used]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the spread of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s
do]{.mark}es [not increase]{.mark} **international
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But, despite the claims of many
proliferation optimists, [[it is **nonsensical** to
argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s will **never
be used** and]{.mark} to **simultaneously [claim]{.mark}** that
[their]{.mark} [spread contributes to]{.mark} **international
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As was argued above, [**the most
obvious way out** of this dilemma is to
**[concede]{.mark}**]{.underline} that nuclear [[prolif]{.mark}eration
[does]{.mark} **indeed raise** the [risk]{.mark} of nuclear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--AT: Prolif Good\-\--AT: Cohen\-\--2NC

#### Cohen is wrong.

**Hymans 19** \-- Jacques E.C. Hymans, International Relations Professor
at the University of Southern California. \[Do nuclear crises vaccinate
against nuclear war? The Non-Proliferation Review, 23(3-4), Taylor &
Francis\]

Despite the book's many merits, it gets into trouble by stretching the
theory and evidence to argue---including in the book's very title---that
"proliferation causes peace." Throughout the book, Cohen repeats like a
mantra, "Nuclear proliferation is dangerous when leaders learn that
nuclear assertion is safe, but it is safe when they learn that nuclear
assertion is dangerous." This mantra appears nearly verbatim on pages
50, 112, 152, 207, 220, 231, and 234, and in a slightly weaker
formulation on pages ix, 3, and 124. Cohen repeats the mantra so often
because he believes he has found the key to resolving the famous debate
between "proliferation pessimists" who think that more states with
nuclear weapons increases the chances of bad things happening and
"proliferation optimists" who think that more states with nuclear
weapons decreases the chances of bad things happening.8 Cohen argues
that his theory shows that both sides in this debate are half-right (pp.
206--07). Pre-crisis nuclear states behave in line with
"proliferation-pessimist" logic, whereas post-crisis nuclear states
behave in line with "proliferation-optimist" logic. But [Cohen's
conclusion]{.underline} that nuclear crises vaccinate against nuclear
war [needs to be **heavily qualified**]{.underline}.

The first problem with Cohen's "proliferation becomes safe" mantra is
that the psychological literature on which he relies focuses on
individuals' fearful learning as a result of their own actions, yet the
correctness of [the mantra **depends on**]{.underline} those
[lessons]{.underline} also [being internalized by **entire
states**]{.underline}. After all, [nuclear arsenals]{.underline} tend to
[last **a lot longer** than top leaders]{.underline} do. Belatedly
recognizing the gap between his micro-level theory and his macro-level
conclusions, in his final chapter, Cohen acknowledges the possibility of
a post-crisis reversion to nuclear assertiveness by "subsequent
generations of leaders who come to power decades later in autocracies,"
and maybe a little sooner than that in democracies (pp. 213--14).
Cohen's own case study of Richard Nixon also recognizes that Nixon did
not internalize the lessons Kennedy had drawn from the Cuban Missile
Crisis, and therefore he embarked on a spree of nuclear assertiveness
after landing in the White House in 1969. It was Kennedy---Nixon\'s
archrival---who was in power in October 1962, and therefore the crisis
did not affect Nixon\'s thinking about the bomb as it did Kennedy\'s.
Again, such a reversion to nuclear assertiveness by a subsequent leader
is entirely consistent with Cohen's psychological theory. But, by the
same token, it is powerful evidence against Cohen's general claim that
[**"new" nuclear powers** are **more dangerous** than **"experienced"
ones**]{.underline} (e.g., p. 24). Cohen makes a weak stab at papering
over the inconsistency by stating, "Nixon's nuclear assertion is
anomalous, as experienced nuclear powers tend to authorize restrained
foreign policies" (p. 180). But Ronald Reagan was also highly assertive
in the nuclear realm and seems to have needed his own near-death
experience of nuclear crisis in the 1980s to draw in his horns.9
Similarly, regarding South Asia, Cohen makes much of the deceleration of
the Kashmir crisis for a decade or so after 2002 as evidence of the
power of nuclear-crisis learning (see p. 129); but today, Kashmir is
ablaze again, and India and Pakistan are back to playing with nuclear
fire.10 Thus, it would appear that the salutary effects of nuclear
crises last only a few years at most. And [if countries need to go
through **a new nuclear crisis** every decade]{.underline} or so [to be
reminded that nuclear assertion is **dangerous**]{.underline}---as a
proper interpretation of Cohen's theory indicates---[then proliferation
**simply can't** be safe]{.underline}.

The second problem with [Cohen]{.underline}'s "proliferation becomes
safe" mantra is that it **[downplays]{.underline}** all of the ways that
[nuclear weapons]{.underline} can end up destroying human lives for
reasons other than top leaders' deliberately assertive foreign policies.
In fact, [nuclear weapons are **very dangerous**]{.underline} even [when
top leaders are **highly prudent** and view their]{.underline} nuclear
[weapons as nothing more than **last-resort deterrents** against
**external aggression**. For instance, what about the security
dilemma]{.underline} in which actions that are meant by the leader to be
prudent and defensive are interpreted by the other side as being
aggressive? What about the destabilizing effects of new technological
advances that imperil states' second-strike capabilities, causing
leaders to face the difficult choice of ["use 'em or lose
'em"?]{.underline} What about the very real potential for [nuclear
accidents and unauthorized use?]{.underline} Indeed, as Scott Sagan has
shown, [**risk-averse efforts** to increase the safety of a nuclear
arsenal **often backfire** and increase]{.underline} the potential for
**[accidents]{.underline}**.11 And of course, lest we forget: what about
the possibility that a nuclear crisis goes fatally wrong before it can
turn into a useful "teachable moment"? In short, while it's surely a
good thing when the leaders of nuclear powers start lowering their
expectations of what their arsenals can help them achieve, that
evolution in their thinking hardly erases the nuclear danger.

The third problem with [Cohen]{.underline}'s "proliferation becomes
safe" mantra is that it [relies on **broad generalizations** about **all
human beings**, while minimizing **the very real differences** between
**different personality types**]{.underline} and, indeed, [between
**unique individuals**]{.underline}. As noted previously, Cohen's
empirical test of the theory consists of in-depth case studies of two
individual leaders, with briefer glances at four additional ones. All
six of the leaders he looks at more or less conformed to the expected
pattern. But [this is **a very small sample size**, which]{.underline}
ipso facto [comes with **huge standard errors**]{.underline}. Moreover,
[**even if** Cohen could have studied **999 leaders**]{.underline} who
went through nuclear crises and found that they all subsequently behaved
exactly in line with his theoretical predictions, [this would **still
not guarantee**]{.underline} that [**the thousandth leader** would
behave that way]{.underline}. And, given that millions of human lives
are on the line, would even a one in-thousand error rate be acceptable?

This last point comes back full circle to what I argued at the outset of
this review. It is useful, even vital, to use political-science methods
to seek a better understanding of the general behavioral tendencies of
top leaders in nuclear affairs. Cohen's book is a fine example of how to
do it. When it comes to giving policy advice, however, we must not be
satisfied with what political science can do. There is also a place for
less systematic, but potentially more insightful methods of analyzing
each leader as a unique individual with historical agency. As Aristotle
taught, the essence of practical judgment is to strike the right balance
between the universal and the particular. Even if we do strike that
balance, our predictions may still be wrong. Ultimately, then, [**the
real problem** is not]{.underline} just this or [that]{.underline}
individual [leader, but]{.underline} the destructive power of [the
**bomb itself**]{.underline}. [**Nuclear proliferation** is **always
dangerous**]{.underline}, and [it becomes **especially dangerous** when
we start thinking it could be safe]{.underline}.

[SMRs designed to **serve a military base** would face an even **greater
challenge**]{.underline} since they [could be **attacked** on the **same
economic grounds** as commercial reactors.]{.underline} The [arguments
**in favor** of **vSMR deployment**]{.underline}---that they could
minimize the need for long fuel supply lines and thus fill a warfighting
capability gap, for example---[**evaporate** when considering large,
**domestic** bases]{.underline}. [Even assuming that such a need could
be identified and that it justifies new]{.underline} program
[development, defense programs must be competitive when
possible]{.underline}. [Unless **resilient**, **independent supply**
were given **far more weight** than it **now** receives]{.underline},
[there is **little guarantee**]{.underline} that [a nuclear design would
win the day for base power supply]{.underline} any more than it is
dominating deregulated energy markets. [Other]{.underline} generating
[sources such as]{.underline} combined cycle [**natural gas** constitute
**viable alternatives**]{.underline} if sound dual-fuel management
practices are adopted. In short, [[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[remain **victims**]{.mark} of]{.underline} their [poor **economic
competitiveness**]{.underline}, absent a hard, statutory mandate or an
overly rigid performance parameter that forces a nuclear solution.
Regardless, [the [existence of **ready substitutes** makes]{.mark} this
[program a **recurring target** for]{.mark} [the **DoD budgeter's
ax**]{.mark}]{.underline}: [it would [consistently be the **last
program** in and the first one out of]{.mark}]{.underline} any
submission to [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### The plan [necessitates]{.underline} political lobbying and [engenders]{.underline} strong [budget opposition]{.underline}.

[[Should]{.underline}]{.mark} a fleet of [[SMRs]{.mark} developed by DoD
[somehow]{.mark}]{.underline} [[succeed]{.mark} in]{.underline}
fulfilling its ([poorly defined]{.underline}) [mission]{.underline}, and
should it succeed in spawning a following within Congress, [another
prosaic [question]{.mark}]{.underline}---that [[of **intellectual
property**]{.mark} ownership [and]{.mark} **program
[management]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[would
emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}. Once DoD had deployed several dozen SMRs,
and once the infrastructure that supports these SMRs was developed, even
following a "fee for service" model, the [military might consider
bringing the entire enterprise in-house]{.underline}. This would
effectively create another Naval Reactors program and [[would surely
**engender strong opposition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given the
[[contentious nature of budget battles]{.mark} across the
services]{.underline}, the [[military does not need **additional
fiefdoms**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The creation of [Naval Reactors
was]{.underline} initially [**[highly controversial]{.mark}**, and [any
SMR fleet]{.mark} that relied extensively on DoD]{.underline}
development and [[deployment would undoubtedly create another]{.mark}
such [mini-empire]{.mark}]{.underline}. For such a [program]{.underline}
not to [[devolve into a **fiasco**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a similarly
vigorous level of project management, situational awareness, and
[[**political lobbying** would be **required**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Military organizations that have been created to address more critical
warfighting needs, such as the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat
Organization, grew far beyond their original mandate and expected scope.
[If commercial development lags or fails to materialize]{.underline},
there is also the [very real possibility of]{.underline} developing
another [industrial base component]{.underline} that is [entirely
reliant on the military for support]{.underline}, much like
shipbuilding. Parts of the military-industrial complex already resemble
a monopsony, with programs maintained to support the nation's industrial
base despite often-limited warfighting impact: the controversy
surrounding the USS Zumwalt-class guided-missile destroyer, which many
critics have called a boondoggle, serves as a prime example.

#### Waste management is [politically burdensome]{.underline}.

The organizational troubles do not end once the overall management
structure is defined. Whether managed in-house or by a contracted vendor
(as with the Navy nuclear labs), [another fiefdom would almost certainly
be created in the form of a waste-management organization]{.underline}.
Given the absence of a national geological repository, this [would
effectively force the military into the political imbroglio that is
nuclear waste management and storage]{.underline}. [Even a small fleet
of]{.underline} a few dozen [SMRs would quickly saddle the military with
an unenviable job]{.underline}. Complicating things further, this waste
would likely not be under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.
[It would be logical for other nuclear powers to]{.underline}
[assume]{.underline} that [it is potentially weaponizable and alter
their own strategic doctrines accordingly]{.underline}. Alternatively,
DoD could lobby for a transfer of responsibility to the Department of
Energy, which would simply add to that organization's already
challenging waste management task.
