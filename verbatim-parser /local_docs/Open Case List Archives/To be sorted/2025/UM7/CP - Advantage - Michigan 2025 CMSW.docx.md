Beginning [in the]{.underline} early days of the [Cold War]{.underline},
[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} has [[relied]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the threat to use **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}
first [as a way [to **deter**]{.mark} both nuclear and non-nuclear
attacks]{.underline}. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[world]{.mark}
has **[changed significantly]{.mark}** since then]{.underline}. In the
contemporary era, the [[dangers and **risks of a first-strike policy
outweigh**]{.mark} the [hoped-for **deterrence**
benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [United States should]{.underline}
join China and India in [[adopting a declared **no-first-use**
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} and should [[**encourage** the other
nuclear-armed states to do likewise]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
[[no-first-use]{.mark} policy means]{.underline} that the [United
States]{.underline} [[would pledge to use nuclear]{.mark}
weapons]{.underline} **[[only in retaliation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for
a nuclear attack]{.underline}. The sole purpose of U.S. nuclear weapons
would then be to deter --- and, if necessary, respond to --- the use of
nuclear weapons against the United States and its allies and partners.
**[To be credible]{.underline}**, [this declaratory pledge would need to
be **reflected** in a **retaliatory-strike-only** nuclear force
posture.]{.underline}

The [**[most important goal]{.underline}**]{.mark} for the United States
today [should be to [**prevent** the use of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the United States dropped atomic
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 --- the only use of nuclear
weapons in warfare --- it has [established a nearly 74-year tradition of
not using nuclear weapons]{.underline}. This [[tradition is the **single
most important fact**]{.mark} of the nuclear age]{.underline}. Today,
the [[risks of nuclear war]{.mark} are
**[increasing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Heightened geopolitical
**[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a [more **[complex
calculus]{.mark}** of deterrence in a]{.underline} [[**multipolar**
nuclear world]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**renewed reliance** on nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, **[technological arms races]{.underline}** in
nuclear and non-nuclear systems, the [**collapse** of arms
control]{.underline}, and the [return of **nuclear
brinkmanship**]{.underline} have all [resulted in highly]{.underline}
[**dangerous deterrence** policies]{.underline} that, **[through
miscalculation or accident]{.underline}**, could [plunge the United
States into a nuclear war]{.underline} with North Korea, Russia, or
China. The [[nuclear-armed states]{.underline} [**urgently** need to
step back]{.underline}]{.mark} from this dangerous situation [by
adopting a **no-first-use** policy]{.underline} that would
[**significantly reduce the risk** of nuclear war.]{.underline}

International Relations Theory and No First Use

Several theoretical approaches in international relations help to
illuminate why states choose to adopt a first-use versus a no-first-use
(NFU) policy. A realist approach, which emphasizes the central role of
material capabilities, would generally be skeptical of no-first-use
pledges, which it would view as "cheap talk" and unenforceable. States
that have made such pledges could still launch a nuclear weapon first in
a conflict. Thus, NATO leaders and other observers expressed
considerable skepticism during the final years of the Cold War that
Russia's declaration of an NFU policy in 1982 had any real substance
behind it.1 Today, while India has made an NFU pledge, analysts debate
how constraining it really is. In turn, Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi is sometimes dismissive of China's NFU policy.2

But some [states]{.underline} --- India, China, and the Soviet Union for
a period --- have nevertheless pledged no-first-use and, in the cases of
India and China, have [attempted to make those pledges]{.underline}
**[credible]{.underline}**. What explains these choices? The empirical
record suggests that a state's choice regarding a nuclear first-use
policy tends to be strongly influenced by asymmetries in the
conventional military balance between nuclear-armed adversaries.
Nuclear-armed states that face a conventionally superior military
adversary will threaten to use nuclear weapons first because they depend
more heavily on nuclear threats to defend themselves. In contrast,
nuclear-armed states that possess overwhelming conventional superiority
are more likely to declare an NFU policy because it privileges their
conventional advantage on the battlefield and might help to keep the
conflict non-nuclear.

Thus India, which possesses a much larger conventional military than
Pakistan, declared an NFU policy in 1999, following its nuclear test in
1998. Pakistan, which relies heavily on its nuclear deterrent for its
defense against India, has rejected Indian calls to adopt a no-first-use
pledge.3 This logic also helps explain why, in 1993, Russia dropped its
NFU pledge first made in 1982. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1989, as Russian conventional military forces deteriorated and the
United States declined to reciprocate the NFU pledge, Russian leaders
felt they had to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons.

Consistent with this logic, during the Cold War, the United States
relied on a first-use threat to offset and counter the overwhelming
conventional superiority of the Soviet conventional military threat in
Europe. Today, the situation is reversed. The United States possesses
overwhelming conventional superiority while Russia's conventional
military has declined. Because U.S. conventional military power now
vastly exceeds that of its largest adversaries, Russia and China, many
argue that America's first-use policy is now unnecessary to deter
conventional threats.4

China's NFU policy, on the other hand, while consistent with its small
nuclear force, is less well explained by asymmetries in conventional
forces. China adopted an NFU policy at the time of its first atomic bomb
test in 1964, when its peasant army was still transitioning to a modern
military force. Part of the explanation for this decision has to do with
Mao's thinking about the nuclear bomb as a "paper tiger," but Chinese
leaders have primarily seen an NFU policy as an effective way to signal
the purely defensive nature of the small Chinese nuclear arsenal and to
avoid a U.S.-Soviet-style arms race.5 An NFU policy also conveys the
spirit of "peaceful coexistence" to which China is committed.

The theory that adopting an NFU policy is based on asymmetries in
conventional forces is further complicated by the existence of other
weapons of mass destruction. During the George W. Bush and Barack Obama
years, the strongest argument for the United States to retain the
first-use option was that nuclear weapons are necessary to help deter
and possibly retaliate against attacks with chemical and especially
biological weapons.6 The Trump administration's 2018 Nuclear Posture
Review has expanded the category of non-nuclear attacks that it will
seek to deter with nuclear threats to include cyber attacks, a move that
previous presidents had ruled out and that most observers view
skeptically, given its dangerous escalatory potential.

A second theoretical perspective, "liberal institutionalism," emphasizes
the role of rules and institutions, both domestic and international, in
stabilizing expectations and behavior. According to this theory, even if
no-first-use pledges are unenforceable, they are not necessarily
meaningless. To be meaningful, an NFU pledge must be built into domestic
institutions, that is, the structure of operational military
capabilities.7 A genuine NFU policy would require that nuclear forces be
consistent with an "assured retaliation" posture that eschews
counterforce objectives --- the ability to destroy an adversary's
nuclear arsenal before it is launched.

This perspective thus emphasizes the value of an NFU pledge in
structuring operational forces to make them smaller and less
threatening. When Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, soon after
entering office in 1961, sent a directive to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
about strategic force requirements, he stated that the first assumption
shaping requirements was that "we will not strike first with such
weapons."8 McNamara's directive was undoubtedly partly an effort to stem
Air Force demands for a first-strike capability and the vast procurement
of weaponry it would require. This directive, in effect, repudiated the
extended deterrent doctrine that the United States would respond to a
Soviet conventional attack in Europe with nuclear weapons.

At the international level, liberal institutionalists emphasize the
value of rules and institutions to prevent nuclear war. They argue that
NFU has become a de facto norm anyway and therefore should be declared
publicly and multilaterally. As Morton Halperin, who later became deputy
assistant secretary of defense for arms control, wrote as early as 1961,
"There now exists a powerful informal rule against the use of nuclear
weapons," and it would be advantageous to the United States to transform
this tacit understanding into a formal agreement.9 Indeed, the "negative
security assurances" first issued by the United States and the other P5
countries in 1978 and renewed periodically --- commitments to
non-nuclear states that are members of the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against them ---
already constitute a partial NFU regime. Liberal institutionalists would
also point out that constantly touting the value of a nuclear threat for
security sends signals that nuclear weapons are useful and undermines
nonproliferation goals.10

Finally, constructivists, who focus on the role of norms, identity, and
discourse, emphasize that a [[declared NFU]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline} is an [[important way to strengthen **norms
of nuclear restraint**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the nearly 74-year [tradition of **non-use**]{.underline}. [Strong
statements]{.underline} from leaders about the need to avoid using
nuclear weapons can help **[[reduce tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
just as irresponsible tweets can increase them. In the constructivist
view, an [NFU policy]{.underline} is also a [diplomatic
tool]{.underline} that can be used to signal that a state is a
responsible nuclear power. As Modi recently put it, "India is a very
responsible state. We are the only country to have a declared NFU
\[sic\]. It's not because of world pressure, but because of our own
ethos. We will not move away from this, whichever government comes to
power."11 Indeed, India's NFU pledge has proved useful for portraying
Pakistan as a relatively irresponsible custodian of its nuclear arsenal.
Likewise, Indian leaders use their NFU pledge as a way to resist
pressures to sign any treaties that would restrict India's nuclear
arsenal.

https://tnsr.org/roundtable/its-time-for-a-u-s-no-first-use-nuclear-policy/;
7-26-2025)//CMSW-ShajSpec

As Kingston Reif and Daryl Kimball of the Arms Control Association have
argued, "a [clear U.S. [no-first-use policy]{.mark} would [**reduce the
risk of** Russian]{.mark} or Chinese nuclear
**[miscalculation]{.mark}**]{.underline} during a crisis **[[by
alleviating]{.mark} [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}** about a devastating
U.S. nuclear first-strike."24 This [would mean]{.underline} that the
[United States would rely on nuclear]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline}
[only to deter nuclear attacks]{.underline}. [Adopting this
approach]{.underline} would [involve more than "cheap
talk,"]{.underline} for it would [require meaningful doctrinal and
operational changes]{.underline}.25 Specifically, it [would allow the
United States]{.underline} [to adopt a **less threatening nuclear
posture**]{.underline}. It [would **[eliminate first-strike
postures]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[preemptive
capabilities]{.underline}**, [and other types of **destabilizing
warfighting**]{.underline}]{.mark} [strategies]{.underline}. It would
**[[emphasize restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}** in targeting,
launch-on-warning, alert levels of deployed systems, procurement, and
modernization plans. In other words, it [would help shape the physical
qualities of nuclear forces]{.underline} in a way that [[renders them
**unsuitable**]{.mark} for missions other than deterrence of nuclear
attacks.]{.underline}26

[[Implementing]{.underline}]{.mark} these steps [would]{.underline}
**[[significantly reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [risk of
**accidental**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[unauthorized]{.underline}**,
**[mistaken]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [or
**[preemptive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[use]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[removal of threats]{.underline}]{.mark} of a nuclear first strike
[would]{.underline} also **[[strengthen]{.mark} [strategic]{.mark} and
crisis [stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**.27 Of perhaps equal importance,
[adopting an NFU]{.underline} policy [would]{.underline} help
[[address]{.underline} **[humanitarian concerns]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline} **[reduce the salience]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}.28 Likewise, it [would]{.underline} "[be
[more consistent with]{.mark} the long-term goal of **[global nuclear
disarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} and would better contribute to US
nuclear non-proliferation objectives."29

A **[multilateral NFU]{.underline}** pledge would [have even more
benefits]{.underline}. It would move Russia and Pakistan away from their
high-risk doctrines and reduce a source of Russia-NATO tensions. A
common NFU policy would help anchor the existing NFU policies of China
and India and implicitly acknowledge their leadership in this area, a
virtue when middle-power states are feeling disenfranchised from the
global nuclear order.

Some analysts have questioned whether, in an asymmetric conflict, an
American NFU policy would actually help reduce the risk of nuclear
escalation by an adversary. The United States is so conventionally
dominant, they argue that, in a crisis, a country like North Korea might
employ nuclear weapons preemptively because the United States could take
out North Korean targets even with just conventional weapons.30 It is
true that an NFU policy might make no difference in such a situation.
Still, it might [[nevertheless **remove** at least one source]{.mark} of
**crisis instability**]{.underline}. Most importantly, however, in an
era of "multi-front" deterrence, [North Korea is not the only
adversar]{.underline}y and a [U.S. [NFU policy would **remain
valuable**]{.mark} in less asymmetric conflicts.]{.underline}

A second concern is that a real NFU strategy would require a greater
commitment to a counter-value targeting strategy --- targeting civilians
rather than nuclear silos --- and thus run up against moral and legal
rules prohibiting the direct targeting of civilians.31 This is a
legitimate point. However, [current U.S. counterforce targeting policy
will **likely result** in massive civilian casualties]{.underline} as
"collateral damage," [making the risk to civilians of an NFU strategy
**little different**]{.underline}.32

#### Nuclear weapons are unnecessary -- conventional methods suffice and using nukes opens Pandora's box

**Tannenwald 19 -** Nina Tannenwald is an American political scientist.
She is a senior lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Brown
University, and a former director of Brown\'s International Relations
Program. (8-1-2019; \"It's Time for a U.S. No-First-Use Nuclear
Policy\"; Texas National Security Review;
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/its-time-for-a-u-s-no-first-use-nuclear-policy/;
7-26-2025)//CMSW-ShajSpec

These [[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} are **[[not
compelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** for four reasons. First, a [policy of
[calculated ambiguity is **unnecessary**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today,
there are [[**very few missions** that the United States could **not
accomplish with conventional weapons**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Indeed,
[U.S. [conventional capabilities are **more than
sufficient**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to deter and respond to anything but
a nuclear attack]{.underline}. [None of the United States' most likely
adversaries]{.underline} --- Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran [---
can **hope to defeat** the United States]{.underline} and its allies in
a protracted non-nuclear conflict.

Second, [[threats of first use]{.mark} are
**[dangerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Michael Gerson has argued, [they
**[undermine crisis stability]{.mark}** in multiple ways]{.underline}.15
The [large, highly accurate U.S. nuclear arsenal]{.underline}, along
with missile defenses and new dual-use precision-strike weapons, may
[lead leaders in Russia and China to believe that the [United States is
capable of **conducting a disarming first strike**]{.mark}]{.underline}
against them. [Furthermore]{.underline}, the [entanglement]{.underline}
of nuclear and conventional weapons [in [deterrence strategies could
**inadvertently increase**]{.mark} the chance of **[nuclear
war,]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}while new, [smaller nuclear
warheads]{.underline}, along with **[doctrines of "escalate to
de-escalate]{.underline}**" [appear to be **lowering the
threshold**]{.underline} for nuclear use.16 In a crisis, Russian or
Chinese leaders might come to believe that the United States might
attempt a disarming strike, forcing them, in turn, to contemplate acting
preemptively.17

Third, although [[supporters of calculated
ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark} fervently [believe it maximizes
deterrence]{.underline}, the [evidence for such a claim [is **hardly
definitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Nuclear weapons **did not deter the
9/11**]{.underline}]{.mark} attacks; the [rise of the]{.underline}
[**[Islamic State]{.underline}**; **[Russian
interventions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in Georgia]{.underline}, [Ukraine,
or Syria]{.underline}; [or North Korean nuclear [and]{.mark}
**[ballistic missile tests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nor have Indian and
Pakistani nuclear weapons deterred risky conventional crises between the
two countries over Kashmir, most recently in February 2019. The
calculated ambiguity argument gained some support from the perception
that during the 1991 Gulf War a U.S. nuclear threat had helped deter
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from using chemical weapons against U.S. and
coalition forces or Israel.18 As Scott Sagan has persuasively argued,
however, it is highly unlikely that a nuclear threat in fact deterred
Saddam from using chemical weapons.19 Indeed, recent research suggests
that the threat to use nuclear weapons first against non-nuclear states
has little credible coercive power.20

Fourth, [even in the very small number of scenarios where nuclear
weapons might seem to be necessary]{.underline} --- for example,
knocking out North Korean mobile missiles or underground command centers
--- [opening the **Pandora's box** of nuclear use would likely lead to
**uncontrolled escalation**]{.underline}. There is [[no scenario in
which using nuclear weapons first]{.mark}]{.underline} can **[[make a
bad situation better]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As James Doyle, a former
staffer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, has argued, "It is **[folly
to believe that the use of nuclear weapons could de-escalate a
conflict]{.underline}**."21

As for [[threatening to use nuclear weapons first]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in support of extended deterrence]{.underline} commitments, [[such a
policy **lacks credibility**]{.mark} because the **costs** of starting a
nuclear war would **vastly outweigh the benefits**]{.underline}. As
Henry Kissinger once said, "**[[Great powers don't commit suicide for
their allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**."22 Thus, as a number of analysts
have persuasively argued, [extended deterrence]{.underline} [based
on]{.underline} a **[conventional military response]{.underline}** to a
conventional threat [is much more credible]{.underline}. Moreover,
**[constantly arguing]{.underline}** that [nuclear weapons are
necessary]{.underline} **[reduces the credibility]{.underline}** of the
United States' more usable conventional deterrent.23

### NFU Fails\-\--2AC

#### An NFU decks US ability to deter and respond to threats

7-26-2025)//CMSW-ShajSpec

A [first-use policy]{.underline} is [based primarily]{.underline} [on
the belief that the threat of nuclear escalation continues to serve as a
deterrent]{.underline} to large-scale conventional war or the use of
chemical and biological weapons.12 [Critics]{.underline} of NFU
[argue]{.underline} that the [[United States **should not make any
promise**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[might **make it easier for an
opponent**]{.mark} to plan an effective military action]{.underline}, a
strategy known as "**[[calculated ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}**." As
the Defense Department recently explained,

[[Retaining a degree of ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
[[refraining from a no first use policy]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[creates]{.mark} **[uncertainty]{.mark} in the mind of potential
adversaries**]{.underline} and **[[reinforces deterrence of
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by ensuring **adversaries cannot
predict** what specific actions will lead to a U.S. nuclear
response]{.underline}. [Implementing]{.underline} a [[no first use
policy could **undermine** the U.S. ability to **deter Russian, Chinese,
and North Korean aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially with
respect to their growing capability to carry out nonnuclear strategic
attacks.13

In addition, [skeptics]{.underline} [believe]{.underline} that an [NFU
promise would be **especially costly** for the United
States]{.underline}, given its wide-ranging extended deterrence
commitments.14

#### The United States federal government should invest in the development and implementation of bacteriophage therapy.

#### Bacteriophages solve AMR and ABR but are under-utilized

**WHO 25 -** The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of
the United Nations which coordinates responses to international public
health issues and emergencies. (2-17-2025; \"Bacteriophages and their
use in combating antimicrobial resistance\"; WHO;
https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/fact-sheets/item/bacteriophages-and-their-use-in-combating-antimicrobial-resistance;
7-26-2025)

[[Bacteriophages]{.underline}]{.mark} (phages) are [viruses]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [[**selectively target** and **kill
bacteria**]{.underline}]{.mark}. They are the [[**most abundant**
commonly occurring natural entities]{.underline}]{.mark}, [playing
**[crucial roles in regulating bacterial populatio]{.mark}ns** and
**influencing microbial ecosystems**.]{.underline}

[Phages]{.underline} are **[[useful]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they [[can
destroy bacteria **resistant to drugs**]{.mark} such as
antibiotics]{.underline}. [Phages infect]{.underline} their bacterial
hosts [with great specificity]{.underline}. They **[do not infect human
cells]{.underline}**.

[Antimicrobial resistance (**[AMR]{.mark}**]{.underline}[) [poses a
**serious global threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to our ability to treat
bacterial infections]{.underline}. [New antibiotics]{.underline} have
often [proved **difficult** and **expensive** to develop]{.underline}.
This has led to an interest in an older approach to treating microbial
infections by using phages. [[Phage therapy can be a **promising
too**]{.mark}**l** for controlling AMR]{.underline}, which is [[one of
the **top global public health**]{.mark} and development
**threats**.]{.underline}

In the WHO European Region, [[AMR is **directly responsible for 133 000
deaths**]{.mark} each year]{.underline} and [**[indirectly linked to 541
000 deaths]{.underline}**. [Estimates]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[show]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[AMR costs the European
Union]{.underline}]{.mark} and European Economic Area about **[€[11.7
billion each year]{.mark}]{.underline}** due to health expenditure and
workforce productivity losses.

[Addressing AMR requires a **multifaceted approach**]{.underline} that
considers the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental
health -- known as the One Health approach. [[Phages provide
**biologically innovative approaches**]{.mark} to addressing the
challenge of AMR]{.underline} [across sectors]{.underline}, ranging from
[therapeutic use]{.underline} in humans and animals [to potentially
replacing antibiotic]{.underline} [use]{.underline} in the agricultural
sector.

**[[Currently]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[phages are primarily
used]{.underline}]{.mark} on compassionate grounds[, [in
life-threatening situations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [when all other
treatments have been exhausted]{.underline}.

Further evidence from clinical studies is needed before phages can
become widely available for human use. Phage application and therapy
requires robust evidence to support its efficacy, safety, and
feasibility across all One Health sectors.

How can phages be used to treat bacterial infections?

[Phages]{.underline} that are used for therapy are lytic, which means
that they [**[infect and destroy]{.underline}** [bacterial
cells]{.underline},]{.mark} [[effectively **preventing the onward
spread**]{.mark} of infection.]{.underline}

[[Phages are **highly specific**]{.mark} to their bacterial
hosts,]{.underline} that is the bacteria they target. They
[**[do]{.mark} [not infect human]{.mark}** [cells but can target and
kill bacteria]{.mark}]{.underline} that could cause disease [[**without
disrupting** the body's]{.mark} normal [microbiota]{.mark} or causing
significant side-effects]{.underline}. [Phage therapy can be
tailored]{.underline} [to]{.underline} individual bacterial
[infections]{.underline}, particularly those that are [resistant to
antibiotics]{.underline}. Phages can be combined to make mixtures that
can target most common infections. [Phages]{.underline} can also be
[used alongside antibiotics]{.underline} to enhance treatment efficacy,
especially against infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In
medicine, [phages]{.underline} have been described as a
"**[[personalized medicine]{.underline}]{.mark}**" -- a group of
treatments adapted to each patient individually.

In some countries in the eastern part of the WHO European Region, phages
are more broadly used as a treatment for bacterial infections,
especially when antibiotics fail.

However, unlike antibiotics, [phages are **not approved**
medicines]{.underline} (biological medicinal products) in most
countries. Therefore, they are [primarily used on compassionate
grounds]{.underline}, in life-threatening situations, when all other
treatments have been exhausted.

Further evidence from clinical studies is needed before phages can
become available more widely for therapeutic use in humans.

How can phages be useful in combating AMR?

[[Phage therapy]{.underline}]{.mark} can be [**[useful]{.underline}**
[in the treatment]{.underline}]{.mark} and prevention of infections [in
humans, animals and plants]{.underline}, [and [potentially in the
**environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

In humans, [phages]{.underline} can be [used as therapy]{.underline} for
bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics, which means
those that no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines. Case studies
have shown the [[**successes of phage therapy** in the]{.mark}
[treatment]{.mark} of infections caused by bacteria]{.underline}, such
as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.

In veterinary medicine, [[phages]{.underline}]{.mark} are used to
[[treat infections in livestock]{.mark} and companion
animals]{.underline}, reducing the reliance on antibiotics and thereby
decreasing the overall consumption of antimicrobials, which is
[considered a key factor in the development and spread of
AMR]{.underline}. In agriculture and food production processes,
[[phages]{.underline}]{.mark} can be [[applied to control bacterial
diseases]{.mark}.]{.underline} Phages are used to target harmful
bacteria like salmonella and Escherichia coli in poultry and cattle,
reducing infections without relying on antibiotics.

Phage treatments are currently applied to crops like tomatoes, peppers,
and potatoes to control bacterial pathogens such as Xanthomonas and
Erwinia that cause diseases like bacterial spot and soft rot. Likewise,
phage sprays are used to manage a serious bacterial disease caused by
Erwinia amylovora, which affects apple and pear orchards.

In aquaculture, [[phages]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[replace]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[use of
[antibiotics]{.mark}]{.underline}** and chemicals [that]{.underline} may
[contribute to the development of AMR]{.underline}.

Other potential environmental uses of phages include disinfecting
hospital surfaces and wastewater treatment.

Environmental phages could play an important role in One Health
responses to AMR by helping us to better understand, control and limit
the global and local emergence, selection and transmission of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their genes.

The potential broader adoption of phage therapy requires further robust
evidence to support its efficacy, safety, and feasibility across all One
Health sectors.

Are phages new?

[Phages]{.underline} have [long been used]{.underline} to control
microbes in human, animal and environmental settings. [Many countries in
eastern Europe have used phage therapy]{.underline} for over 100 years.
In western Europe, phages are primarily used on compassionate grounds,
in life-threatening situations, when all other treatments have been
exhausted.

However, **[[more evidence is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to
support]{.underline} the wider [[routine use of phages in
humans.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Are phages substitutes for antibiotics?

[Phages]{.underline} could [offer]{.underline} an **[[alternative to
traditional antibiotics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or be used in
combination with them to enhance treatment efficacy]{.underline}.

In the case of drug-resistant bacteria, [phages provide]{.underline} a
[**[biologically innovative approach]{.underline}** [to treating
infections]{.underline} [that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[can no longer be
treated with traditional antibiotics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, further evidence from clinical studies is needed before phages
can become widely available for routine therapeutic use in humans.

Can phages be used against all bacterial infections?

No, phages cannot be used for the treatment of all bacterial infections
as it might not be possible to identify corresponding phages and amplify
them for all bacterial infections. Although phages may be found, they
might not have the right properties needed to treat infection.

Bacteria can develop resistance to phages, and complex, mixed infections
would need treatment with a combination of multiple phages. For specific
bacterial infections, phage therapy holds promising potential, but it
cannot be used universally against all infections.

Can phages be dangerous to humans?

[[Phage therapy]{.underline}]{.mark} is generally considered **[[safe
for humans]{.underline}]{.mark}** as [[phages do not target human
cells]{.underline}]{.mark}. [They]{.underline} do, however, [interact
with human cells]{.underline} that can take them up, which [could be a
useful way of targeting intracellular bacteria]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, there are some risks because, like antibiotics, phages can
cause the release of endotoxins (toxic substances from bacterial cell
walls), leading to inflammatory responses, especially in large-scale
infections.

Further evidence from clinical studies and monitoring are needed before
phages can become widely available for therapeutic use in humans.

#### Any resistance will be easily overcome -- unlike antibiotics, phages can evolve and increase effectiveness

[**[Will phage resistance develop like for

[[Bacteria]{.underline} [can develop **resistance**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[to phages]{.underline}, just like they can develop resistance to
antibiotics, but [[phage-resistant bacteria are **often less

[**[Positive aspects]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[bacteriophages]{.underline}

**[[Antimicrobial agents]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[The use of antimicrobials reflected]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[better
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} of microbial relations in foods at
the time of the food preservation strategy formation. Some
[[microflora]{.underline}]{.mark} is [**[beneficial]{.underline}** [in
food from a competitive aspect]{.underline},]{.mark} whereas native
microflora must be eradicated or killed under other circumstances. As a
result, [broad-spectrum antimicrobials are frequently replaced with more
targeted preservatives]{.underline}. This approach is less effective
than bio-preservation with bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria.
[[Using phages is **another**]{.mark} **[way]{.mark}** to [change the
bacterial ecology]{.mark} actively]{.underline}. d'Herelle found that
[**[lytic phages]{.underline}** [were effective against the
dysentery]{.underline}]{.mark} [bacillus]{.underline} (Shigella) [in the
faeces of convalescing patients in 1917]{.underline}, which makes him
the first to consider phages as a bio-therapeutic option1. Phage
prophylaxis has been described for treating various human and animal
diseases as well as a patented medicinal treatment. Phage therapy could
be a better antibiotic option43. Phage therapies are also being used to
treat Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, and the results in the animal
studies that comprise of mice models are positive44.

**[Alternatives to antibiotics]{.underline}**

[Nobody will disagree]{.underline} that the [use of
antibiotics]{.underline} in various agricultural-based food production
[should be strictly regulated, because it is a significant source of
bacterial resistance]{.underline} that eventually extends to clinical
environments. **[[Bacteriophages]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
phage-isolated proteins (phage therapy) **[are [promising
treatments]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for]{.mark} [various bacterial
infections24]{.mark}]{.underline},45. Popular antibiotics, such as
beta-lactams, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and aminoglycosides, are
less effective or ineffective in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, causing
problems in the medical industry46. Almost [[700,000 people worldwide
die each year as a result of disease-causing bacterium]{.mark}
resistance]{.underline}, and **[fatalities are anticipated to rise by
more than 10 million]{.underline}** by 205047. The [quest for novel
medicines is vital]{.underline}, and the [battle against antimicrobial
resistance is still ongoing]{.underline}. According to experts
[exploring alternative antibiotic therapy]{.underline}, the [most
significant challenge is ARGs that code for bacterial resistance to
conventional antibiotics]{.underline}, which **[[phages]{.mark} might be
a [viable]{.mark} [option48]{.mark}]{.underline}**,49.
**[[Phages]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be [[used to treat
illnesses]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[caused by a variety of
bacteria]{.underline}]{.mark}, which include Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella, and Salmonella. It has been [shown
that many of these bacteria are
**[antibiotic-resistant]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}an[d [can cause
fatal Infections50]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Phages]{.underline}]{.mark}
can [[treat infections]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [induced by the
lysis phenomena]{.underline} generated by the microorganisms. The [west
had **traditionally lagged** in regard to phage therapy
development]{.underline} even after successful phage therapy
implementation in former Soviet republics and Eastern European
nations13. Treatment with phages was effective against cystic fibrosis,
also known as resistant infections. Some groups of researchers found
that bacteriophage treatment is also ineffective on the infectious
pathogen, which is due to the resistance against it. Susceptibility
assessment of bacteria to a specific bacteriophage is essential before
being used as a therapy51. Treatment usually consists of a mixture of
many phages, which is due to a lack of quick diagnostic screening tests.
The bacterial lysis causes the release of endotoxin, which will cause
sepsis52. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of phages easily gets
diffused to all other organs. Another key challenge with phage therapy
is immunogenicity, which means that the defense system may be triggered
the first time and then destroy the phages as soon as they enter the
system using the system's defense mechanism a second time. Phages can
now be used in novel ways to prevent bacterial infection, which is due
to advances in genetic engineering53,54. Antibiotic-resistant infectious
diseases of the lungs, which are known as pulmonary infections, are
among the most dominant55. **[Phages]{.underline}** [that can combat
these diseases have already been tried]{.underline} in in-vitro models
and in animal models, and the **[[results have been
promising]{.underline}]{.mark}** [especially when the phages are
delivered via nebulization as in aerosol form56]{.underline}.
Antibacterial medications, such as phages and antibiotics can be given
locally to the lung cells as aerosols for respiratory tract
infections57. This enables larger concentrations at the site of
infection, which prevents antibacterial agent dispersion in places where
it isn't needed. This results in dramatically increased action in situ
and fewer potential side effects. A 5-year-old child with cystic
fibrosis was given a commercial bacteriophage product after failing to
respond to regular antibiotic treatment (prophage) in 2008. The bacteria
P. aeruginosa and S. aureus have been associated with the illness. The
drug was delivered three times a day via nasal phage nebulization. No
weight gain was observed for a year before the treatment, but the
child's general condition significantly improved after six days of
therapy, and a weight gain of 1 kg was observed after twenty days. S.
aureus and P. aeruginosa were undetectable in the sputum after three
therapy sessions, which included one with tetracycline58. Pseudomonas
phages demonstrated antibacterial activity in the sputum of cystic
fibrosis phages in-vitro59. Morello et al.60 obtained multi-resistant P.
aeruginosa from a cystic fibrosis patient and intranasally administered
the pathogens to animals in order to induce pneumonia in a mouse model.
Bacteria, inflammatory markers, and cytotoxicity, which included cell
death and endocytosis, levels were all examined to see how far the
infection had progressed. Phage P3-CHA was used in an animal study in
order to check the lethal levels of P. aeruginosa with two doses of
phage 3.0×107 and 3.0×108 plaque forming unit (PFU) per mouse. The
bacterial count in the high phage dose treated group was observed to
have decreased by more than 2-fold in contrast to the control group 20 h
after the treatment. The phage-treated group had significantly lower
levels of cytokines and lactic dehydrogenase than the control group.
Similar results were seen in the histological investigations of the
animals' lungs. The pneumonia was treated with an intranasal spray of
the same phage before infection61. [Overview of **advantages of
bacteriophages over the antibiotics**]{.underline} are shown in Fig. 2.
Aerosol-based phage therapy appears to be a [**successful way** of
treating extremely antibiotic-resistant bacterial
respiratory]{.underline} infections, [particularly infections that are
caused by BCC,]{.underline} according to Semler et al.62. Another study
was conducted in 2015 in order to investigate phage therapy in-vitro and
in-vivo in minks against P. aeruginosa hemorrhagic pneumonia, as well as
the effectiveness of ultrasonic atomization of phage preparations. The
researcher used vB PaeP PPAABTNL (PPA-ABTNL), which is a lytic
Podoviridae phage that is isolated from hospital sewage. The phage was
tested against five strains of P. aeruginosa that were taken from minks
with hemorrhagic pneumonia. The in-vitro [tests]{.underline}
[demonstrated]{.underline} that the [phage was **[exceptionally
effective in killing the bacteria]{.mark}** it was meant to
kill]{.underline}. The [phage was later determined]{.underline} **[to be
extremely safe]{.underline}** in in-vivo rat investigations. The study
states that this [delivery method]{.underline} could be used to
**[[treat pneumonia]{.underline}]{.mark}** caused by these bacteria63.

[**[Negative aspects]{.underline}** [of
bacteriophages]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [use]{.underline} [and effectiveness]{.underline} of phage therapy
in humans, animals, and plants have been [previously
demonstrated]{.underline}, but [there are some
**limitations**]{.underline} [as well as potential **issues** when
utilizing phage treatment therapy]{.underline} in other circumstances,
which [include]{.underline} [**[fundamental human safety
issues]{.underline}**116]{.mark}. No harmful effects have been observed
due to phage treatment, but the [**purity of phages** may pose a
problem]{.underline}. [Phages emit]{.underline} lipopolysaccharides,
peptidoglycan, or other [inflammatory components]{.underline} after they
lyse bacteria, which [can end up in the crude phage
preparation]{.underline}117. Various technologies, such as density
gradient centrifugation and column chromatography118, are now available
for phage purification that are simple and cost-effective, and these
methods have reduced problems that are related to contaminants. **[Phage
contamination]{.underline}** [during fermentation gave the first
evidence in the dairy industry]{.underline}, which provided crucial
information on the presence of phages in the food industry. These
dietary settings serve as a host for bacteria and phages to coexist.
Many factors may limit the use of phages and the creation of new
therapeutic formulations. Furthermore, [[preparing phages]{.underline}
[for medicinal application]{.underline} **[is
challenging,]{.underline}**]{.mark} and [not all of the
[issues]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that are strictly interrelated
with phage biology **[[have been]{.mark}
[resolved6]{.mark}]{.underline}**,119,120.

**[Increased risk of antibiotic resistance]{.underline}**

Lysogenic [phages]{.underline} could be [vehicles]{.underline} [for
horizontal gene transfer]{.underline} [and contribute to ARG
spread]{.underline}. [Transduction]{.underline} might theoretically
[result]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [**[emergence of new
microbes]{.underline}** [or even **more
resistance**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**genes** in
bacteria121]{.underline}]{.mark}. [However]{.underline}, the [exact role
of phages in the propagation of ARGs **remains unknown**]{.underline}.
Phage inducers, which are substances that are capable of encouraging the
expression of the prophage gene or leading to the excision and spread of
temperate phages, can help disperse ARGs in the environment. Bacteria
can be infected with new phage particles and then be lysed with EDTA or
sodium citrate, which triggers the lytic cycle of lysogenic viruses and
phage release outside the cell. [[Antimicrobial-resistant
pathogen-infected patients']{.mark} [secretions]{.mark}]{.underline} and
tissues [[have]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[substantial
number]{.underline}]{.mark} 600 of phage transport genes that are
**[[linked to antibiotic resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has
[previously been constantly treated with 601 antibiotics49]{.underline}.
Some [antibiotic-resistant genes have been reported in the
phages]{.underline} present in the environment, but its efficacy to
transfer these genes to the bacteria and the resultant successful uptake
and expression of these antibiotic-resistant genes needs to be further
studied before taking any conclusive inferences122.

Impact of phages on the food industry

The role of phages in starter culture failure has been extensively
researched and discussed70. More than 10% of the raw milk samples that
were collected from different dairies included Lactococcus lactis
phages. 37% of the lactococcal and streptococcal phages were identified
in the raw milk samples that were used for yoghurt manufacturing in
another study. Refrigerated foods, such as red meats and poultry, are
perishable, and they support a complex microbial environment and huge
numbers of bacteria (2 to 6 log CFU/g). These dietary conditions serve
as hosts for bacteria and phages to coexist. The [most common cause of
fermentation failures]{.underline} in the dairy industry [is the **phage
infection** of dairy starter cultures]{.underline}. [[Phage
breakouts]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[result]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} **[financial losses]{.underline}**]{.mark}, such as
[**[factory halts]{.underline}**, **[raw material waste]{.underline}**,
**[poor product quality]{.underline}**, **[microorganism
proliferation]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [or [even]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[total production loss]{.underline}**15]{.mark}. The starter activity
is completely lost due to a dead vat when a phage infection is severe,
which results in the dumping of a considerable amount of partially
acidified milk. A few actions should be taken to avoid the adverse
effects of phages on dairy starting culture, which include the use of
mixed strains, the cheese manufacturing and whey handling unit must be
located away from the starter preparation area, the use of a phage
inhibitory medium for bulk batch starter production, the injection of
frozen concentrated starter cultures directly into cheese vats,
sanitation regimes, air filtering, and a variety of additional tactics.
The effective monitoring at the area's entrance, swift and effective
phage detection tools, and control measures help limit the risk of phage
proliferation within the fermented sector of the dairy industry.

Natural phages may impact the variety of microbial communities by
exerting species-specific control over indigenous bacteria, thereby
influencing the microbial communities' diversity123. The close
monitoring of entrance channels, quick and effective phage detection
technologies, and control measurements are being used in order to limit
the risk of phage proliferation in dairy settings. **[Manufacturing
delays]{.underline}**, the **[waste of components]{.underline}**,
**[lower quality]{.underline}** [products]{.underline}, the **[growth of
spoilage]{.underline}**, [and **infectious microbes**]{.underline}, or
even **[total production loss,]{.underline}** can [all result from
**phage outbreaks15**]{.underline}.

**[Bacterial resistance]{.underline}** against phages

[[Bacteria]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially and possibly may [**[become
resistant]{.underline}** [to phages]{.underline}]{.mark} [over a
specific period]{.underline}, and [**[bacteria have]{.underline}** [or
can create a multitude of methods in order to **evade phage
attacks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. These [mechanisms]{.underline} primarily
**[prohibit phage adherence]{.underline}** [to bacterial
receptors]{.underline}, the activation of steps to prevent phage DNA
inoculation into the cell, and the prevention of phage reproduction and
release by hiding, altering, or losing the receptor and secretion of
chemicals124. Variation or the lack of receptors for membrane protein
changes is demonstrated in E. coli, S. aureus, Bordetella
bronchiseptica, and Vibrio cholerae. Pseudomonas spp release
extracellular polymeric compounds, and Enterobacteriaceae release
glycoconjugates125,126. The antibiotic association, a mixture of phages
that are capable of lowering the bacterial resistance, or a high
concentration of original phages are all viable options. The phage
mixture, a higher initial phage inoculum, and antibiotic interactions
can all help in order to reduce the development of bacterial resistance
to phages. If phages eliminate pathogens quicker than these can
multiply, a large inoculum is linked to a lower likelihood of generating
phage-resistant bacteria11.

PORT ARANSAS, Texas --- [[Microbiologists]{.underline}]{.mark} at The
University of Texas at Austin and their colleagues have [**[cracked the
genetic code]{.underline}** [of how]{.underline}]{.mark} [[bacteria
broke down oil]{.underline}]{.mark} to help clean up the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill. The [findings]{.underline}, published in the journal
Nature Microbiology, [reveal]{.underline} that some [**[bacteria have
far greater potential]{.underline}** [for consuming]{.underline}
[oil]{.underline}]{.mark} than was previously known. The
[[research]{.underline}]{.mark} also [has
**[applications]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for responding]{.underline} [to
**future oil**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[spills]{.mark}** and other
**ecological disasters**]{.underline}, while shedding light on the ways
in which tiny microbes played an outsized role in limiting damage from
the 2010 spill caused by the explosion of a BP oil rig.

Since the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, scientists have studied how
communities of bacteria that grew exponentially after the disaster
helped to eat away at the vast range of chemicals there, but little was
known about the genetic underpinnings of the process. Brett Baker, an
assistant professor in the Department of Marine Science; Nina
Dombrowski, a postdoctoral researcher in his lab at The University of
Texas Marine Science Institute; and colleagues sequenced the DNA of
oil-munching microbes to reveal the genetic potential in different
bacterial species, including ones newly identified as important to the
cleanup task.

"[Oil is extremely complicated]{.underline} but it has [two major
compounds]{.underline}: alkanes, which are **[[relatively easy for
bacteria to break down]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and aromatic
hydrocarbons, which are much trickier to get rid of," Dombrowski said.
"We [found a number of bacteria]{.underline} surprisingly **[[capable of
dealing with the more dangerous compounds]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
has [[implications for future oil spills]{.underline}]{.mark} and how we
[**[take advantage]{.underline}** [of the natural environmental
response]{.underline}."]{.mark}

One [[bacterium]{.underline}]{.mark} known to [[have **oil-eating
abilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Alcanivorax, was previously thought
incapable of consuming the more stable hydrocarbons the spill left
behind. Others, like Neptuniibacter, weren't known to be involved with
degrading oil in the Gulf. Not only did the [[gene
sequencing]{.underline} [show]{.underline} [several bacteria could
**break down** aromatic hydrocarbons]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
illuminated how [[various species worked together]{.underline}]{.mark}
to **[[maximize the genetic potential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the
whole microbial community]{.underline}.

"[[We used **new methods**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to obtain [genomes
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[bacteria]{.underline}** [that haven't been
grown in the lab]{.underline} [to enhance our
understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} of how **[[bacteria consume oil in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Baker said.

The scientists catalogued the [genes of numerous bacteria from the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill]{.underline} to [figure out how microbes
gobble up the complex mix found in oil]{.underline}, which consists of
as many as 1,000 types of chemical compounds. The researchers pinpointed
specific pathways where members of the complex, native bacterial
community work together to consume oil.

"It's equivalent to a concert," Dombrowski said. "All the musicians have
to work together to make a piece of beautiful music. After the spill,
all [bacteria]{.underline} must [[work together]{.underline} **[to
efficiently degrade oil."]{.underline}**]{.mark}

The scientists even found that some [[bacteria]{.underline}]{.mark}
might **[[assist with "cleanup after the
cleanup,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** meaning they [also could eat what
humans pour into the water to clean up the oil]{.underline}. These
[dispersants]{.underline} can **[cause environmental problems
themselves]{.underline}**. The DNA sequencing revealed evidence that
some bacteria can degrade sulfur-containing compounds such as those
found in dispersants used after the Deepwater Horizon spill.

5.3 Biological Treatments (Bioremediation)[[To
overcome]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark}
associated with that of above treatments, [the oil is utilized as a
carbon source]{.underline} by some in situ microorganisms by the process
of "bioremediation" (Tazaki, 2013; Hu and Chan, 2015). So,
**[[bioremediation]{.underline}]{.mark}** can be **[[deﬁned as the use
of microorganism]{.mark} either individually or in a
consortium]{.underline}** (Chhatre et al., 1996) [to **[detoxify or
remove pollutants]{.mark}** with their diverse metabolic
actions]{.underline}. The [main purpose of the bioremediation
design]{.underline} [should be the creation of]{.underline} the most
[favourable conditions]{.underline} [for microbial growth and
activities]{.underline} (Jeong, et al., 2015).
[Bioremediation]{.underline} [is]{.underline} an **[ecofriendly and
economical]{.underline}** technique [for cleaning and restoration of
sites that have been contaminated with the petroleum
products]{.underline} [and other crude oils]{.underline} with no
generation of secondary pollution (Menendez-Vega et al., 2007; Chan,
2011).

[**[Genetically Modifed Microbes for Bioremediation]{.underline}** [of
Oil Spills]{.underline}]{.mark} in Marine Environment 
[281Microorganisms particularly bacteria and fungi]{.underline} are the
major natural recycling agents. They [have the ability to
transform]{.underline} either aliphatic or aromatic
[**[hydrocarbons]{.underline}** [and **use that for energy and growth**
purposes]{.underline}. **[Hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [[yeast and fungi are widely
distributed in marine]{.mark}, fresh water and soil
habitats]{.underline} (Oelschlägel et al., 2015). The major hydrocarbon
degrading microbes include genera, Alanivorax, Bacillus, Pseudomonas,
Bravibacillus, Acinetobacter, Dietzia, Methylobacterium, Caulobacter,
Halomonas, Flavobacteriales, Candidauts, Vibrio, etc. (Harayama et al.,
2004; Nakamuraet al., 2007; von der Weid et al., 2007). The BTEX
(benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene isomers) [degraders are
found in situ identiﬁed]{.underline} though the [polymerase chain
reaction,]{.underline} denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and
nucleotide sequence analysis (Kao et al., 2008). In spite of being
bacterial ﬂora, yeast and fungi are also efﬁcient oil hydrocarbon
eaters. The **[[reported efﬁcacy of
biodegradation]{.underline}]{.mark}** ranged from 6 percent to **[[82
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}** for soil fungi, 0.13 percent to 50
percent for soil bacteria and 0.003 percent to 100 percent for marine
bacteria (Das and Chandran, 2011). The microbial transformation of PAHs
has been studied on the lower-molecular-weight compounds, such as
naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene, but more recent studies have
shown the capabilities of other microorganisms to metabolize higher
molecular weight compounds, including the white rot fungus Phanerochaete
chrysosporium. The degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons requires the
microbial consortium (Balba et al., 1998).Sometimes the indigenous
microorganisms are incapable for bioremediation of spilled oil through
the process of biostimulation. Hence, to achieve bioremediation, the
known oil eating bacteria are added externally at the contaminated
sites. This process is known as bioaugmentation (Nikolopoulou et al.,
2013; Hassanshahian et al., 2014). [[**Bioaugmentation has been
successful** in removal of sites contaminated with aromatic
compounds]{.underline},]{.mark} but [still faces many environmental
limitations]{.underline}. One of the [most difﬁcult issues is survival
of strains introduced at the site]{.underline}. It has been observed
that the number of exogenous microorganisms has decreased shortly after
inoculation at the contaminated site. Many studies have shown that both
abiotic and biotic factors inﬂuence the effectiveness of bioaugmentation
(Mrozik and Piotrowska-Seget, 2010). The [most important abiotic factors
are temperature, moisture, pH and organic matter content]{.underline}.
The indigenous population of microbes has capability to degrade
different kinds of hydrocarbons, but the toxic chemicals present along
with the hydrocarbons inhibit the growth of populations. So to avoid
this, the microorganisms are cultured under the harsh environment in the
laboratory by providing nutrients aseptically and then are added at the
site of spilled hydrocarbons. This treatment not only adapts the
microorganisms at the toxic pollutant sites, but can also degrade the
hydrocarbons (Xu and Lu, 2010; Suja et al., 2014). The potential of
bioremediation of hydrocarbons would be increased with the addition of
microorganisms which are already present at the contaminated site. The
best example is the addition of microbial community from soil around the
petrol pumps to the spilled petroleum on marine water. This process is
known as autochthonous bioaugmentation, but these isolates may not show
signiﬁcant growth due to extreme parameters in marine waters

282  Bioremediaon: Current Research and Applicaons(Nikolopoulou et
al., 2013). [Bioaugmentation and biostimulation processes combindely
accelerate]{.underline} [bioremediation]{.underline} of hydrocarbons.
Before bioaugmentation, some factors are needed to be considered
concentration of the contaminant, the **[availability of the hydrocarbon
degrading microbes,]{.underline}** nutrients along with the physical
parameters including pH, temperature, pressure, salinity, etc. (Suja et
al., 2014). The [culturing of local community of microbes in nutrient
broth containing all the parameters required for growth in marine water
can be **adapted in the laboratory**]{.underline} to avoid the

hydrocarbonsAlso there are some microbes that accelerate the degradation
process by producing surfactants (surface active agents) called
biosurfactant. The main role of surfactants is to make hydrophobic
compounds more soluble with the breakdown into smaller droplets by
decreasing the surface tension at the water-oil interface owing to
provide them for microbial degradation (Wei et al., 2005; Saeki et al.,
2009). Also, the [biosurfactants produced by the microbes are
biodegradable in nature]{.underline}, so **[no question of their
pollution]{.underline}**. Some biosurfactant producers and the type of
biosurfactants are Alcaligenes faecalis (glycolipids) (Bharali et al.,
2011), Pseudomonas aeruginosa MA01 (rhamnolipids) (Khoshdast et al.,
2012; Singh and Tripathi, 2013), Candida lipolytica (ruﬁsan) (Ruﬁno et
al., 2013), etc. Most common biosurfactants are glycolipids in which
carbohydrates are linked to a long-chain aliphatic acid, while others,
like lipopeptides, lipoproteins and heteropolysaccharides, are more
complex (Dua et al., 2002).

Genecally Modied Microbes for Bioremediaon of Oil Spills in Marine
Environment  283The biosurfactants are either excreted outside the cell
or they remain adhered with their cell membrane. The adhered
biosurfactant modiﬁes the cell membrane of the its producer in such a
way that the hydrophobic hydrocarbons are readily internalized into the
cell (Chandankere et al., 2014). It has been reported that some
microbial consortium are likely to produce biosurfactants under harsh
environment of extreme temperature, pressure, pH, salinity, carbon
sources stresses at ex situ or in situ sites (Darvishi et al., 2011). To
achieve [**[90 percent removal of spilled hydrocarbons]{.underline}**,
**[the 10 percent biosurfactant production is
necessar]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[y]{.underline}** (Kavitha et al.,
2014). For bioaugmentation of biosurfactant producers, initially those
are screened as: haemolysis in blood agar, oil spreading, oil breakage,
emulsiﬁcation property, bacterial adhesion to the hydrocarbons test
(BATH) (Hassanshahian, 2014).Aerobic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria act
initially on the spilled hydrocarbons by producing oxygenase enzyme.
After partial hydrolysis, the bacteria utilize hydrocarbons as carbon
source for their biomass development owing to the removal of spilled
hydrocarbon pollutants in marine environment. Although, the growth is
accelerated under biostimulation process (Das and Chandran, 2011).

FACTORS AFFECTING BIOREMEDIATION6.1 Weathering ProcessesThe weathering
process consists of spreading, evaporation, dispersion, sedimentation,
and emulsion. The volatile components of low molecular weight from the
hydrocarbons are readily evaporated like benzene and n-alkanes, this
assists microorganisms to degrade efﬁciently (Venosa and Zhu, 2003). The
oil-in-water emulsion is mostly favourable which provides
bioavailability of hydrocarbons to the microorganisms. The formation of
water-in-oil emulsions reduces the surface area of oil droplets which
indeed decreases bioremediation of oil. The droplet size of oils is also
one of the vital factors. The smaller oil droplets are readily prone to
be degraded due to their large availability of surface area. 6.2
OxygenThe action of microorganisms on the aliphatic or aromatic
hydrocarbons is oxygen dependant, mostly involves aerobic bacteria.
Since oxygenase is the ﬁrst enzyme produced by the microorganisms during
the bioremediation process and which is oxygen dependent. Oxygen
depletion at the subsurface is the limiting factor for bioremediation of
spilled hydrocarbons, but there are many microorganisms that degrade
BTEX compounds efﬁciently under anaerobic conditions.6.3
BioavailabilityThe rate at which microbial cells can convert
contaminants during bioremediation is directly proportional to the rate
of contaminant uptake and metabolism, and the rate of transfer to the
cell (mass transfer). Increased microbial conversion ability does not
lead to higher biotransformation rates when mass transfer is a limiting
factor (Boopathy, 2000; Pieper and Reineke, 2000).

7\. GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MICROBIAL BIOREMEDIATIONThe [[indigenous
microbial community]{.underline}]{.mark} at the site of spilled oil is
[**[able to degrade the hydrocarbons]{.underline}**,]{.mark} but the
[rate]{.underline} of degradation of hydrocarbons **[is very
slow]{.underline}**. Due to this, [oil hydrocarbons reach the shoreline
before their removal or converting them into simpler form]{.underline}.
If once the oil hydrocarbons reach the shoreline, the beaches and
[coastal areas are affected severely]{.underline}. So, the **[[concept
of bioaugmentation is being utilized]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [But [to
achieve complete bioremediation by bioaugmentation]{.mark}]{.underline},
the [microorganisms should be capable of adapting with the high salinity
water by degrading many hydrocarbons]{.underline} with the production of
biosurfactants within a short duration. Also, the microorganisms must
withstand within the toxic chemicals present with the hydrocarbons. So
to have such microorganism, which can degrade different kinds of
hydrocarbons, salt tolerance, biosurfactants producer, the
microorganisms are genetically modiﬁed by using genetic

Genecally Modied Microbes for Bioremediaon of [[Oil Spills in Marine
Environment  285engineering technique]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is the
**[[technique of manipulation of genetic
sequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to [enhance the **efﬁcacy of
bioremediation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Genetic engineering allows humans
to isolate genes from certain organisms and put them into other
organisms.Several genetic ways have been developed and used to optimize
the enzymes, metabolic pathways and organisms with respect to
biodegradation (Pieper and Reineke, 2000). The essential strategy of
using genetically engineered microbes in bioremediation is to design
such novel strains which have the ability of degrading high molecular
weight polyaromatic compounds. Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens HK44 represents
the ﬁrst genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) approved for ﬁeld
testing in the United States for bioremediation purposes. Strain HK44
has an introduced lux gene as a reporter gene fused within a naphthalene
degradative pathway, thereby allowing this recombinant microbe to show
bioluminescence as it degrades speciﬁc polyaromatic hydrocarbons such as
naphthalene. The [bioremediation process can therefore be observed by
the detection of light]{.underline}. Anand Mohan Chakrabarty, an Indian
born American Microbiologist, is a pioneer for the development of oil
eating 'superbug'. For this research he was awarded US patent. He used
four strains of Pseudomonas containing plasmid. He then isolated the
plasmids from each strain which degrade octane, camphor, xylene, and
naphthalene, respectively. Then he inserted all the four plasmids into
the one strain of Pseudomonas putida which has capability to degrade
octane, camphor, xylene, and naphthalene known as superbug as described
in Figure 13.4 (Renneberg, 2008).Chromosome CAM Plasmid OCT Plasmid XYL

286  Bioremediaon: Current Research and ApplicaonsThe degradative
efﬁciency of polyaromatic hydrocarbons can be enhanced through genetic
engineering. For example[, rate-limiting steps in known metabolic
pathways can be genetically manipulated to yield increased degradation
rates]{.underline}, or [completely new [metabolic pathways can be
incorporated into bacterial strains for the degradation of previously
recalcitrant]{.mark} compounds]{.underline}. In addition, other
strategies using engineered microorganisms for process monitoring and
control, toxicity and stress response assessment, and ﬁnally cleanup of
complete hydrocarbons.It is essential to track the recombinant
microorganisms released into the environment to observe their spread
into the contaminated regions and mitigate their activity. It is
possible by linking the target gene with the reporter under the control
of promoter. The degradation of hydrocarbons is tracked by the
expression of reporter genes inserted in GEM. The activity of reporter
gene is assayed either by enzyme activity or immunoﬂuorescence. The most
commonly and widely applicable reporter genes are lacZ, gfp (green
ﬂuorescence protein), gus, lux, etc. (Sousa et al., 1998).

Since [naturally occurring microorganisms]{.underline} are [**[not

engineered microorganisms]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been [[tendered as

**[[genetic manipulation has advanced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However,
[there have been very few field trials]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
the use of [genetically engineered microorganisms]{.underline} for
bioremediation \[14\].

Although there has been a boom in the commercialization of genetically
modified drugs, crops, and other biotechnological innovations over the
last two decades, [genetically engineered microbes for bioremediation
have not been commercialized]{.underline} \[14\], \[18\].
[Some]{.underline} have [speculated]{.underline} that [cost, complexity,
and a burdensome]{.underline} regulation may be a reason for the lack of
commercialization \[18\]. However, that explanation does not seem to
present the full picture. Since the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) started regulating genetically engineered
microbes about 30 years ago, there has been [**[no
commercialization]{.underline}** [of any genetically engineered microbe
for bioremediation]{.underline},]{.mark} except in demonstration
projects in closed reactor systems \[18\], \[16\].

What happened to the promise of genetically modified microorganisms for
bioremediation? We present an analyses of the research-commercialization
gap using examples. We evaluate this gap from both a regulation and
research-based perspective, taking into account the containment
technologies that have been developed. In this study, we reviewed recent
literature on the development of genetically engineered microbes for
bioremediation and interviewed Ananda Chakrabarty, the first scientist
to patent a living organism (the "**[[oil-eating
microbe]{.underline}]{.mark}**"). Through our analysis of the interview
and literature review, we found that the inability of scientists to
adapt their research to the prevailing regulatory environment, lack of a
risk-based and evolving regulatory framework, and inadequate support by
government agencies to help bioremediation researchers bring their
products to the market could be an explanation for this gap.

We suggest that risk-based regulation and the design of genetically
engineered microbes with technical safeguards could bring about the
important translation of this kind of bioremediation research from the
lab to the field, where it is most needed.

2.1. [Role of traceability technologies]{.underline}

[[Traceability]{.underline}]{.mark} alone does not deliver improved fish
stocks, healthier ecosystems, nor sustained benefits for people. It does
[[improve]{.mark} our [ability to understand]{.mark} whether
[sustainable practices]{.mark} are adopted]{.underline},
**[[identify]{.mark} [fraudulent activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, and
**[aid enforcement]{.underline}**]{.mark} [rules aimed to support
greater transparency]{.underline} of the supply chains. By improving
cost effectiveness and capacity development to utilize the below
described tools, we create the opportunity to lower the startup cost and
barriers to adoption and implementation and facilitate pathways to
sustainable fisheries and livelihoods.

2.2. Molecular genetic tools

The advent of [[affordable]{.mark} and more accessible molecular
[genetics tools]{.mark}]{.underline} [and technologies]{.underline}
(Willette et al., 2014) has [[opened opportunities for
**modernizing**]{.mark} **marine fisheries
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Traditional DNA barcoding is one
such tool]{.underline} that has both been [**rigorously vetted and
widely adopted**]{.underline} late in seafood supply chain [to detect
seafood substitution]{.underline}, including in market and
restaurant-focused studies (Naaum et al., 2016; Luque and Josh Donlan,
2019; Willette et al., 2021a). Yet, [traditional DNA barcoding methods
can be limiting]{.underline}; requiring direct, individual sampling of
fish tissues which is not practical early in the supply chain where
thousands of fish may be transported and processed at once. The
[emergence of environmental DNA]{.underline} (eDNA) methods [helps
circumvent the need for direct sampling of fish tissue]{.underline} by
instead targeting the remnant DNA and metabolic waste left behind in
their environment, which can then be used to identify multiple present
species simultaneously (Deiner et al., 2017). For example, Willette et
al. (2021b) [demonstrated the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for in
situ profiling]{.underline} of [fish species composition]{.underline}
from the [meltwater in the fish holds of industrial and artisanal
fishing vessels]{.underline}, revealing more diverse taxa than generally
reported by the vessel's crew. Such [[applications]{.underline}]{.mark}
would not only [[complement existing surveillance
tools]{.underline}]{.mark} but could [have a transformative effect in
achieving unambiguous species identification]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} fish [supply chain traceability.]{.underline}

[[New applicatio]{.underline}ns]{.mark} of the use of eDNA for
addressing a wide range of scientific and management questions [[emerge
every day]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its [potential use for supporting
fisheries management]{.underline} by supplying abundance indices is
[increasingly explored]{.underline} (Rourke et al., 2022). However,
numerous methodological challenges still need to be overcome and
promising novel approaches remain to be tested (see review in Yao et
al., 2022). One common result across a diversity of case studies is the
high vertical resolution of eDNA signals in stratified marine ecosystems
and the overall positive relationship of eDNA derived abundance indices
with traditional sampling methods such as trawling, visual counts,
echo-sounders, etc. (Rourke et al., 2022). Recent progress has further
been made in applying molecular genetics to estimate absolute abundance
of exploited fish populations based on genotyping fish tissues samples,
identifying related individuals, and applying advanced statistical
methods (Bravington et al., 2016; Trenkel et al., 2022). This approach
also provided novel insights into demographic connectivity and fine
scale population structure, which are essential for both conservation
and sustainable exploitation (Hillary et al., 2018; Trenkel et al.,
2022). Further, applications of eDNA metabarcoding can also be used to
detect rare or threatened species captured as by-catch (Burgess et al.,
2018), catalog fish gut content in diet analyses (Leray et al., 2013),
and spot instances of farmed fish in wild stocks (Aguirre-Pabon et al.,
2015).

Since its earliest application in French wetlands to detect and identify
invasive American bullfrogs (Ficetola et al., 2008), [eDNA
[methods]{.mark} have [gained traction]{.mark} as a tool [for]{.mark}
the **[surveillance]{.mark}** and monitoring of
biodiversity]{.underline}. This **[includes [in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** where federal agencies have launched
in-house eDNA research labs (Morisette et al., 2021) and have been
successful in getting eDNA genetic findings admitted as evidence in
litigation (N.D. Illinois 2010, App. Voices v US Dept of Interior 4th
Cir Court 2022). This [technology is now]{.underline} [undergoing a
transition]{.underline} from research-focused exploratory trials [to
more routine use by fisheries agencies]{.underline} (Aylagas et al.,
2018; Laroche et al., 2018), with the next necessary step the creation
of national and international policies (Lodge, 2022).

2.3. [Vessel monitoring systems]{.underline}

[[Vessel monitoring systems]{.mark} (VM]{.underline}S) are a [technology
that [contributed to i]{.mark}mproving MCS]{.underline},
**[[implementing restricted areas for fishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and [showing a more reliable estimate of fishing effort]{.underline}
than before (e.g., Murawski et al., 2005; Mills et al., 2007). [VMS are
designed to automatically acquire and transmit the position, speed and
heading]{.underline} of the vessel. Because the reporting interval is
mandatory (currently every hour for vessels above 12 meters in the
European Union (EU)), and the [VMS equipment cannot be switched
off]{.underline}, any interruption of VMS signal reception can raise an
alert in the MCS room of the flag state and may be analyzed as potential
attempt to fraud. The VMS data set is encoded and sent over satellite
link to the only authorized recipients. The flag state is the primary
recipient, then sharing on "need to know" basis with coastal states or
Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).

Because of its **[[high level of data security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[VMS is fit for]{.mark} the [purpose]{.mark} of fishing effort
estimate]{.underline}, distant control and possible at-sea inspections.
Most fishing nations now operate a VMS to monitor their industrial fleet
and many are considering monitoring more vessels to include small scale
fisheries with cellular VMS (Burgos et al., 2013). The VMS data link is
also used to transmit the electronic logbook (also called Electronic
Reporting System or ERS), which becomes a mandatory requirement in many
states. The electronic logbook is a computer or tablet application used
by the ship master to report each fishing trip details (start, end,
capture species and quantities, possible bycatch, quantities in hold
when entering or exiting a zone). These data are used for quota
management and fishing effort statistics.

In the EU, monitoring and control of the Common Fisheries Policy is
based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 which requires fishing
vessels above 12 meters to carry a VMS and report their catches via an
electronic logbook. The VMS systems have been adapted for small scale
artisanal boats, with cellular connectivity and solar panels (STARFISH,
2020). All EU member states today operate a [[Fisheries Monitoring
Center]{.mark} (FMC) for their national fleet]{.underline}, to manage a
vessel register, [[monitor]{.mark} the [fishing
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, [compare with the licences and
authorizations]{.underline}, **[[detect suspicious
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and exchange data with the European
Commission and regional fisheries management organizations. [Data
exchanges through the UN Flux format and cybersecurity are becoming
standards]{.underline} in a context [where fisheries irregularities can
[lead]{.mark} [to **heavy penalties**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2.4. [[Automatic identification systems]{.underline}]{.mark}

A[utomatic identification system (AIS) is another
[technology]{.mark}]{.underline} which has [[progressively been
installed]{.underline}]{.mark} on most vessels above tonnage thresholds
under the SOLAS regulation V/19 as a collision avoidance system
supporting safety of life at sea. Like VMS, [AIS also transmits the
vessel position and movements]{.underline} but more frequently and in
open broadcast format, so that everyone with an appropriate AIS receiver
can pick up the messages. While the initial concept allowed reception in
close proximity only (ship-to-ship to avoid collision) or through
institutional coastal systems (port authorities), the [AIS usage has
greatly change]{.underline}d with introduction of web-based AIS data
providers and commercial satellite-AIS constellations. These systems now
make the vessels movements a commodity which can be purchased by any
entity, including fishing companies to monitor their competitors,
shipping companies to evaluate the traffic in ports etc. Some fishers
prefer not to disclose the best fishing grounds and turn off the system,
some others engaged in illegal activities may switch off (Welch et al.,
2022) or purposely tamper their AIS device to send false identifiers or
positions (called AIS spoofing; Androjna et al., 2021).

The [reference data portal providing free access to global AIS data
sets]{.underline} is the Global Fishing Watch (Kroodsma et al., 2018),
which [acquires AIS from satellite operators]{.underline}, [publishes
them and supports data analytics]{.underline} **[[revealing large scale
IUU activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The portal also shows that AIS
tracking is not evenly distributed over the planet. However, the portal
gives only a partial view of actual fishing since most small fishing
vessels do not have an AIS, or not an AIS model able to be received by
satellite.

2.5. [Remote electronic monitoring]{.underline}

**[Remote electronic monitoring ([REM]{.mark}]{.underline}**) is a
[[technology of interest in **deterrence of IUU
fishing**]{.underline}]{.mark} at sea [and appraisal of incidental
catches]{.underline} such as marine mammals (Kindt-Larsen et al., 2012).
[REM consists of a complete VMS, including CCTVs, sensors on winches,
conveyors and freezers]{.underline}. The best AIS or VMS will not tell
which species and quantity is actually captured, and the real figures
may differ from those declared in the electronic reports. The
[[monitoring of bycatch]{.mark} is a [prime example]{.mark}]{.underline}
[demonstrating the capacity]{.underline} of REM **[[to deter IUU
fishing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Bycatch represents the non-targeted
organisms captured while fishing for specific species. It could be
tempting to discard it at sea to save limited hold space for target
species, or to avoid a complete fisheries closure in the case of mixed
fisheries where the vessel has reached its quota for a given species
(the choke species) and cannot take the risk to continue fishing for the
other species. [Bycatch is by nature underestimated and
underreported]{.underline}. In 2019, FAO evaluated discards at 9.1
million tons or 10% of total catches, and fisheries may interact with 20
million individuals of endangered species (sea birds, turtles, sharks
etc.; Pérez et al., 2019). [Many states have consequently implemented
landing obligations for all bycatch]{.underline}, but these measures are
complex to monitor unless deploying observers to monitor the deck
activities. Where onboard observers were mandatory, [their replacement
by cameras has been increasingly considered and implemented]{.underline}
when COVID pandemic prevented boarding of observers. Presently less than
1% of global fisheries are subject to REM. REM is a complex system to
adapt to each individual vessel, and it may generate substantial amount
of information, for which artificial intelligence will be necessary to
extract relevant events from hours of video footage (Monkman et al.,
2019), [yet another [technology]{.mark} with the [potential to
transform]{.mark} marine fisheries [management and **combat IUU
fishing.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

EM = Electronic Monitoring

In the U.S., the [[use of EM]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[still]{.underline}]{.mark} primarily in the
"**[[experimental]{.underline}]{.mark}**" stage. [[Experimental EM
typically is **used by a few vessels** in]{.mark} a fishery to test the
efficacy of technology]{.underline} and, in most cases, to [compare EM
data to those provided by ASOs]{.underline}. Examples of largely
experimental EM include the New England Electronic Monitoring Project
(Pria et al. 2014) and the Maine Coast Community Sector EM Initiative
(Ecotrust Canada 2016). A

smaller number of EM programs have moved to the fleet trial stage where
technical, operational and/or regulatory adjustments are still being
made as part of EM implementation. [[Examples]{.underline}]{.mark} of EM
programs at this stage of development [[**include the** **Pacific
Groundfish EM programs for the whiting**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [fixed
gear, and trawl fisheries]{.underline} (PFMC 2016), and [the Alaskan
North Pacific Fisheries Management Council]{.underline} EM Program
(Loefflad et al. 2014).

**[[In Alaska, EM is fully operational]{.underline}]{.mark}** in four
fisheries to verify compliance with regulations for catch sorting and
weighing. Three of the programs are in the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands (BSAI) fisheries and one in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) fishery
(Cahalan, et al. 2014). These fisheries include the BSAI non-pollock and
pollock trawl fisheries, the BSAI longline fishery for Pacific cod, and
the Central GOA Rockfish Program fishery. [These programs require at
least one observer]{.underline} on board [while the vessel is
fishing]{.underline} so they differ from new EM programs where observers
are generally not required. In the trawl fisheries, the [imagery feed
helps ensure species are not presorted]{.underline} or discarded before
an

observer is able to obtain a sample. In the catcher/processor longline
fishery for Pacific cod, [cameras are used to monitor compliance with
regulations that require all retained]{.underline} [Pacific cod to be
weighed on a flow scale]{.underline}. [Imagery required for
compliance]{.underline} monitoring may be [viewed in real-time by the
observer]{.underline} and/or periodically collected and checked by
management agency staff. The use of EM in the fixed gear, [small boat
fishery for halibut]{.underline} and sablefish in Alaska is in [a
pre-implementation phase and is]{.underline} [expected to
become]{.underline} [operational in 2018.]{.underline}

The [Atlantic pelagic longline fishery has]{.underline} **[[fully
implemented EM to monitor Bluefin tuna]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[bycatch]{.underline}, [and [**two New England** groundfish]{.mark}
sectors **[voluntarily employ EM]{.mark}** for quota]{.underline}
[monitoring]{.underline} and to [ensure compliance with maximized
retention regulations]{.underline}. The Pacific groundfish EM programs
for the whiting, fixed gear, and trawl fisheries will become operational
in the near future (PFMC 2016). Although not a U.S. fishery,
similarities with many U.S. fisheries makes the British Columbian
groundfish hook and line fishery a useful comparator for U.S. west coast
fisheries. This [fishery is one of the few large]{.underline} [fisheries
**[where EM has become and continues to be a routine component of
MCS]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[(]{.mark}Stanley 2014).]{.underline}

**[[Costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Industry

• [[Costs to industry]{.underline}]{.mark} are
**[[problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [[industry often **doesn't
pay the full EM**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[**costs**.]{.underline} This [can create a problem]{.underline} since
[[fishermen may **not be incentivized**]{.underline}]{.mark} to help

reduce EM costs.

• Given high program EM fixed costs, there must be strategies to get
broader fleet

buy in -- especially as **[[pilot projects are winding
down]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What are the key

strategies and incentives to get "buy-in"?

• [Biggest issue]{.underline} with ASO observers is flexibility and
availability---the "[**[planning]{.underline}**"]{.mark}

**[[costs will be high]{.underline}]{.mark}** if a weather window is
small and observers are not available.

This is [especially a problem in remote geographic areas]{.underline}.

• If industry is looking for panaceas from EM they will be disappointed
and will

undermine EM program success.

• Industry often provides 100's of hours of free upfront costs in
upfront pilot

project costs but rarely are they compensated. Would compensation
improve EM

success?

• In some cases, there are [[there are **excessive regulatory
burdens**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for the fleet to]{.underline}

[enroll in EM]{.underline}. This has the [[potential to
undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially successful
[[programs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• Experience has shown that when institutional incentives are in
alignment, the

collective industry will develop their own self-enforcing standards,
punish bad

performers, and in some cases kick them out of an EFP based EM project.

• Software licensing language by tech providers can be problematic,
expensive, and

many service costs will fall on industry -- the providers don't take
enough

responsibility.

• Long term requirements to hold data and pay storage costs are a major
cost and

problem for industry and will undermine EM success.

• When compliance needs are first established via an observer program,
it is easier

to transition to EM since the compliance requirements and standards are

established.

Government

• Audit based analysis is key to cut labor costs---but need cooperation
and

incentives to make it successful.

• Why can't observers be part timers living in a community? It will
reduce

observer costs in remote locations. Does it really create too many
pressures to

encourage "cheating"?

• [Who is ultimately responsible]{.underline} for EM costs---[[industry
or government]{.underline}]{.mark}? This is

**[[rarely articulated]{.underline}]{.mark}** early on which [[creates
problems and **confusion**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

• EM review costs depend on the fishery and regulations. For example,
the West

coast whiting fishery has lower costs than the West coast IFQ groundfish
fishery.

Technology companies

• [Scale and geography]{.underline} are very **[[big issues in
considering costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**---especially
[given]{.underline}

[small markets]{.underline}. No fishery has 1000's of customers but
usually a few score or a

few hundred at most. [[Geographically **small**]{.underline},
**[diverse]{.underline}** **[and remote fleets]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[[significantly increase EM **costs**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

## Climate Change ADV CP

### 1NC

#### The United States federal government should institute a cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide.

#### CP solves --- reduces emissions

**EDF 20 -** EDF is a nonprofit environmental advocacy group that is
known for its work on issues including global warming, ecosystem
restoration, oceans, and human health. (January 22, 2020; How cap and
trade works;
https://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works)//CMSW-ShajSpec

How [[cap and trade]{.underline}]{.mark} works. [[The]{.underline} [best
climate policy]{.underline}]{.mark} --- environmentally and economically
--- [limits emissions and puts a price on them]{.underline}. Cap and
trade is one way to do both. It's a system designed to reduce pollution
in our atmosphere. Smokestacks [Cap and trade reduces
emissions]{.underline}, such as those from power plants, [by
[set]{.mark}ting [a limit]{.mark}]{.underline} on pollution [[and
creati]{.mark}ng [a market]{.mark}]{.underline}. The cap on greenhouse
gas emissions that drive global warming is a firm limit on pollution.
The cap gets stricter over time. The trade part is a market for
companies to buy and sell allowances that let them emit only a certain
amount, as supply and demand set the price. [Trading [gives]{.mark}
[companies]{.mark} a strong [incentive]{.mark} [to]{.mark} save money by
[cut]{.mark}ting [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} in the most
cost-effective ways. Caps limit harmful emissions The government sets
the cap across a given industry, or ideally the whole economy. It also
decides the penalties for violations. [Carbon dioxide]{.underline} and
related pollutants that drive global warming [are main targets of
such]{.underline} caps. Other pollutants that contribute to smog can
also be capped. In carbon dioxide\'s case, the heat-trapping greenhouse
gas mixes into the upper atmosphere and has a global effect.
[[Reducing]{.mark} [emissions locally lowers]{.mark} levels [around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Companies are allowed to emit set amounts
The total amount of the cap is split into allowances, each permitting a
company to emit one ton of emissions. (You\'d have to drive 2,400 miles,
roughly the distance between New York and Las Vegas, to emit that much
carbon dioxide.) [The government distributes the allowances to the
companies]{.underline}, either for free or through an auction. The cap
typically declines over time, [providing a]{.underline} growing
[incentive]{.underline} for industry and businesses [to reduce their
emissions more efficiently]{.underline}, while keeping production costs
down. Trading can lead to cuts in pollution sooner Companies that cut
their pollution faster can sell allowances to companies that pollute
more, or \"bank\" them for future use. This market --- the \"trade\"
part of [[cap and trade --- gives]{.mark} companies
[flexibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. It increases the pool of available
capital to make reductions, [[encourages]{.mark} [companies to cut
pollution]{.mark} faster]{.underline} and rewards innovation. Because
there are only so many allowances available, [total pollution
drop]{.underline}s as the cap falls. As companies use established
techniques to lower emissions, such as adopting energy-efficient
technology, entrepreneurs see opportunity. Ever wonder why you don\'t
hear about acid rain anymore? Thank [cap and trade]{.underline}, which
[[slashed levels of sulfur dioxide]{.underline}]{.mark} to solve the
problem --- at a fraction of the projected cost. [Cap and trade is
lowering emissions globally]{.underline} A market-based approach like
cap and trade allows countries to make more ambitious climate goals.
Contractors at build site. Environmental enforcement officials, trained
by EDF, conduct an on-site inspection at a factory in China.
[China]{.underline}, the world\'s largest greenhouse gas emitter,
[launched the initial phase of a national carbon market]{.underline} in
2017 with help from EDF. The new emissions trading system is expected to
be the world's largest, dwarfing all existing programs, and is a central
component of China's strategy to tackle climate pollution. The national
program builds on pilot emissions trading systems, which have included
elements of cap and trade and are already underway in seven cities and
provinces in China. They cover more than 2,600 companies in regions with
a population of more than 258 million. [In the [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion\'s]{.underline} Emissions Trading System, capped
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} from stationary structures [were [29%
lower]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2018 than when the program started in
2005. In the United States, [California's]{.underline} climate
[policies]{.underline} have [led to a steady decline]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} the state\'s carbon dioxide [pollution]{.underline}.
The [centerpiece is the cap-and-trade]{.underline} program, which EDF
has helped design and implement. California\'s emissions from sources
subject to the cap declined 10% between the program's launch in 2013 and
2018. Meanwhile, the state's economy is thriving. Cap and trade makes
even deeper cuts possible when countries cooperate, such as the United
States and Canada. California and Quebec connected their systems in
2014, building a strong market that shows great potential.

Public Policy at the University of Chicago. (July 20, 2010; The Benefits
of Cap-and-Trade Would Have Exceeded Its Costs;
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-benefits-of-cap-and-trade-would-have-exceeded-its-costs/)//CMSW-ShajSpec

The announcement that the Senate will not take up broader climate change
legislation before the August recess makes it likely that Congress will
not vote to curtail carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade system this
year. This seems like a natural time to explore what we will lose by
failing to implement an economy wide domestic cap-and-trade system.
Using new analytic tools, we can calculate the actual costs of continued
inaction on climate change and the potential benefits of implementing
new cap-and-trade policies. The findings of this exercise are
surprising: [the [benefits]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the United States economy
of a [cap-and-trade system exceed]{.mark} its
[costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [U.S. government]{.underline} recently
[examined]{.underline} the full range of scientific and economic data
[and developed a new way to measure the costs of releasing greenhouse
gases]{.underline}, like carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. The
government's central conclusion (pdf) is that [the release of
[a]{.mark}n additional [ton]{.mark} [of carbon dioxide]{.mark} today
[will cause]{.mark} about [\$21 of damage]{.mark} globally]{.underline}.
This is referred to as the social cost of carbon. [It finally puts a
monetary value on the expected damages from climate change]{.underline},
including shortened life spans, reduced agricultural yields, and
increased property damage due to higher sea levels. The social cost of
carbon confirms that the price of inaction is substantial. [Assuming
that all nations continue on their current emissions path]{.underline},
[the [average]{.mark} [annual]{.mark} [damages]{.mark} from the increase
in greenhouse gas emissions,]{.underline} relative to 2010 emissions[,
[is]{.mark} expected to be about [\$100 billion]{.mark} over the next
decade]{.underline}. [As the chart reveals]{.underline}, the annual
[[damages by 2050 would be]{.mark} equal to [nearly \$1.3
trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. If caps are not put in place, the average
annual damages from greenhouse gas emissions would be about \$570
billion over the next four decades. \<not-mobile message="To see the
chart, please visit Brookings.edu on your
desktop."\>0730_climate_change_greenstone.jpg\</not-mobile\> The
[projected economic [damages]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} alone are estimated to
[[reach \$200 billion]{.mark} [annually]{.mark} by 2050]{.underline}.
Over the next four decades, the average annual damages are projected at
\$85 billion. There is significant momentum for regulations and
subsidies to boost the energy efficiency of buildings and cars and
incentives for nuclear energy and renewable energy sources. These types
of policies tend to be expensive approaches to reducing greenhouse
gasses and are unlikely to reduce emissions by enough to substantially
slow climate change. [An economy wide [cap-and-trade system]{.mark}
[that limits]{.mark} carbon [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the
levying of a fee for carbon emissions, [[would]{.mark} harness market
forces to [find]{.mark} [the least cost]{.mark} means to reduce carbon
emissions]{.underline}. The Hamilton Project, an economic policy group
that I now direct, detailed the importance of this approach in 2007.
Furthermore, the social cost of carbon calculation illustrates this
point by allowing us to examine the impact that different climate
policies will have within a cost-benefit framework. I assessed the
benefits and costs of the cap-and-trade programs that have been
considered in Congress. Specifically, I examined the Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) recent analysis of the economy wide
cap-and-trade provisions of the American Power Act legislation, which
the Senate considered. [Using the social cost of carbon]{.underline},
[the global cumulative [benefits of]{.mark} the [emissions
reductions]{.mark} produced by the legislation [is]{.mark} roughly \$1.5
to [1.7 trillion]{.mark} between now and 2050]{.underline}. In
comparison, [the EPA's analysis indicates projected cumulative domestic
costs of \$600 billion to \$1 trillion over the same
period.]{.underline} Of course, it is natural to ask why Americans
should pay for benefits in other countries. Climate change is a global
problem and, as such, some of the benefits from U.S. action will spill
over to other countries. In the same vein, we will also reap the
benefits from carbon reduction programs abroad. What we have learned
through past negotiations in the international arena is [that
[if]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [takes]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} clear leadership [position]{.mark}, [it will]{.mark} greatly
[increase]{.mark} the chances of a [global agreement]{.mark} to reduce
emissions]{.underline}. The [passage of an economy wide
[cap-and-trade]{.mark} system [would]{.mark} exert just such
leadership]{.underline}. Indeed, the real payoff from a domestic
cap-and-trade system is that [it could [pave the way for global
action]{.mark} toward emission reductions]{.underline} along the lines
that were discussed at the Copenhagen climate change summit in December.
If there are global emissions reductions like those spelled out in the
Copenhagen Accord, then [the domestic benefits would easily exceed the
domestic costs.]{.underline} The critics of cap-and-trade have been
correct all along. It would impose costs on the U.S. economy. What they
have failed to notice, however, is that [the projected benefits are
larger than these costs.]{.underline}

[A [cap-and-trade]{.mark} system is]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
market-based environmental [policy]{.underline} [that [places a limit on
harmful pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline} and establishes a market-based
price on emissions. Companies must hold permits to cover their
emissions; these permits, often called "allowances," can be bought or
sold at prices determined by supply and demand. [[The]{.mark}
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [is]{.mark} in the process of extending
and [strengthening]{.mark} its]{.underline} carbon dioxide (CO2)
[[cap-and-trade]{.mark} system]{.underline}; California has extended and
strengthened its own system; and nine New England and Mid-Atlantic US
states have extended and strengthened the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI), a program that sets a cap on CO2 emissions from the
electricity sector. In addition, it is expected that before the end of
this year, New Jersey will join RGGI, and Oregon will launch its own CO2
cap-and-trade system. And, most important, perhaps, after years of
preparation and pilot operations, [[China]{.mark} is expected to
[launch]{.mark} the world's largest CO2 emissions trading [system
nationwide]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2020. With such developments in place
and on the horizon, this is an important time to think carefully and
critically about the history of cap and trade and to identify lessons
that can be learned from three decades of prior experiences---both
successes and failures. Historical Context Thirty years ago, many
environmental advocates argued that government allocation of rights to
emit pollution legitimized environmental degradation, while others
questioned the feasibility of such an approach. At the time, virtually
all pollution regulations took a command-and-control approach, in which
governments set uniform source-specific requirements, such as specifying
the type of pollution-control equipment to be used or setting uniform
limits on emissions levels or rates. Today, economists and students of
economics recognize that the [total costs of reducing
emission]{.underline}s (i.e., abatement costs) [under
command-and-control approaches can be much higher than those under
market-based approaches]{.underline} because emissions reduction costs
can vary greatly across sources. Since market-based approaches aim to
reduce overall costs by allowing the firms that find it easiest to
reduce emissions to reduce more---and for firms that find it more
difficult to reduce emissions to reduce less---they can achieve
aggregate pollution-control targets at minimum cost. This is an
important time to think carefully and critically about the history of
cap and trade. In a recently published article in Review of
Environmental Economics and Policy, we examined the design and
performance of seven of the most prominent emissions trading systems
that have been implemented over the past thirty years to identify key
lessons for future applications. We focused on systems that have been
important for the environment and/or the economy, and that have
well-documented performances. We excluded emission-reduction-credit
(offset) systems, which offer credits for emissions reductions from some
counterfactual baseline (the difference between what actually happened
and what would have happened if no emissions reductions measures had
been undertaken). While emissions can generally be measured directly,
emissions reductions are unobservable because the counterfactual
baseline is often ill-defined. The seven emissions trading systems we
examined were the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) phasedown
of leaded gasoline in the 1980s; the US sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowance
trading program under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; the Regional
Clean Air Incentives Market (RECLAIM) in Southern California; the
trading of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the eastern United States; RGGI in
the northeastern United States; California's cap-and-trade system under
Assembly Bill 32; and the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System
(ETS). All these programs except the first are textbook cap-and-trade
systems. The leaded gasoline phasedown was a tradable performance
standard, in which the standard was in terms of a rate of emissions per
unit of product, rather than the mass of emissions. This is precisely
the type of emissions trading system that China is planning to launch to
abate CO2 emissions. President George H.W. Bush signed an amendment to
the Clean Air Act into law on November 15, 1990. Credit: Photo: Charles
Tasnadi/Associated Press Lessons from Thirty Years of Experience
[Overall]{.underline}, we found that [[cap-and-trade]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}, if well designed and appropriately implemented,
[[can]{.mark} [achieve]{.mark} [their]{.mark} core [objective of
meeting]{.mark} targeted [emissions reductions]{.mark}
cost-effectively]{.underline}. This is not something that was taken for
granted before cap-and-trade systems were implemented, and it is still
not accepted in some quarters. That said, the devil is in the details,
and both the design and the economic environment in which systems are
implemented are very important. Moreover, as with any policy instrument,
there is no guarantee of success. Based on the numerous specific lessons
we identified in our analysis, several design and implementation
features of cap-and-trade programs appear critical to their performance.
Key Features for System Design and Implementation First, it is important
not to require prior government approval of trades. In contrast to early
US experience with emissions offset systems, transactions costs can be
low enough to permit considerable efficiency-enhancing trade if prior
approval of trades is not required. Second, it is clear from both theory
and experience that a robust market requires a cap that is significantly
below business-as-usual emissions. Third, to avoid unnecessary price
volatility, it is important for final rules (including those for
allocation of allowances to companies) to be established and accurate
data supplied well before companies must start operating under an
allowance trading system. Fourth, high levels of compliance in a system
that requires emitters (such as coal-fired electricity generators),
rather than fossil fuel producers, to purchase allowances, can be
achieved by ensuring there is accurate emissions monitoring combined
with significant penalties for noncompliance. Fifth, provisions allowing
companies to save permits for later use, called banking, have proven to
be very important for achieving maximum gains from trade, and the
absence of these provisions can lead to price spikes and collapses.
Sixth, price collars can lower costs by providing more stable prices
that facilitate investment planning. A changing economy can reduce
emissions below a cap, rendering it non-binding, or a growing economy
can increase emissions and drive allowance prices to excessive levels.
Price volatility can be reduced by combining a price floor at which the
program administrator will buy allowances with an allowance reserve from
which it will sell at a price ceiling. The [resulting hybrid system will
have less certain emissions reductions]{.underline}, however. Finally,
[economy-wide systems are feasible]{.underline}, although sectoral
programs have been more commonly employed. The latest cap-and-dividend
proposal in Congress was announced by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and
Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) at an event at Resources for the Future (RFF) in
March 2019. Credit: Photo: Julian Bregnard Political Considerations that
Affect Cap-and-Trade Design Experiences with cap and trade also indicate
that political considerations can have important effects on the design
of cap-and-trade programs. First, because of the potentially large
distributional impacts involved, the allocation of allowances inevitably
has been a major political issue. Allowances have been given away for
free to help build political support. Under most conditions, if
transaction costs are low, the total costs of reducing emissions in a
cap-and-trade system are independent of the initial allowance
allocation. This means that the allowance allocation decision can be
used to build political support and address equity issues without
concern about impacts on overall cost-effectiveness. Of course, giving
away allowances for free eliminates the opportunity to generate revenue
by selling them at auction, which in turn eliminates the opportunity to
use the proceeds to cut taxes that distort economic activity. On the
other hand, experience has shown that political pressures exist to use
auction revenue not to cut such taxes but to expand environmental
programs. Indeed, cap-and-trade allowance auctions can and have
generated very significant revenue for governments. Second, companies'
relocation decisions and other adverse competitiveness impacts from
cap-and-trade systems (i.e., leakage) have been a prominent political
concern. Virtually any meaningful environmental policy will increase
production costs and thus could raise these concerns, but this issue has
been particularly prominent in the case of cap-and-trade instruments. In
practice, leakage from cap-and-trade systems can range from nonexistent
to potentially quite serious. It is most likely to be significant for
programs of limited geographic scope---particularly in the power sector
because of interconnected electricity markets. Attempts to reduce
leakage and competitiveness threats through free allocation of
allowances do not address the problem per se, but allowance allocations
updated based on levels of production output can do so. Third, although
carbon pricing (through cap and trade or taxes) may be necessary to
address climate change, it surely is not sufficient. In some cases,
abatement costs can be reduced by using complementary policies that
address related market failures. Unfortunately, the "complementary
policies" that have emerged from political processes have often
addressed emissions under the cap instead---thereby relocating rather
than reducing emissions, driving up abatement costs, and suppressing
allowance prices. Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) speaking in June 2009 about the
American Clean Energy and Security Act, which he cosponsored with Edward
J. Markey (D-MA). The legislation was passed by the US House of
Representatives but it was not taken up by then-Senate Majority Leader

2.0) Identifying New Applications As we noted at the outset,
[[cap-and-trade]{.mark} systems [are]{.mark} now [being seriously
considered]{.mark}]{.underline} [for a wide range of environmental
problems around the world]{.underline}. Past experience can offer some
guidance as to when this approach is most likely to be successful.
First, [the greater the differences in the cost of abating
pollution]{.underline} across sources, [the greater the likely cost
savings from a market-based system]{.underline}---whether cap and trade
or tax---relative to conventional regulation. For example, it was clear
early on that differences in costs for SO2 abatement among sources was
great because of differences in ages of plants and their proximities to
sources of low-sulfur coal. Second, if pollutants are well-mixed in the
receiving airshed (or watershed), [a market-based system is particularly
attractive,]{.underline} because local hot spots are not a concern, and
the focus can thus be on cost-effective achievement of total emissions
reductions. Most cap-and-trade systems have been based on either the
reality or the assumption of the uniform mixing of pollutants. However,
[even without uniform mixing, well-designed cap-and-trade systems can be
effective]{.underline}---as illustrated by the two-zone trading system
under RECLAIM---though at the cost of greater complexity. Third and
finally, Martin L. Weitzman's 1974 seminal analysis of the effects of
cost uncertainty showed that the relative efficiency of taxes versus
cap-and-trade systems depended critically on whether marginal damages or
marginal abatement costs were more responsive to changes in pollution
levels. Subsequent literature has identified additional relevant
considerations. Perhaps more importantly, theory and experience have
shown that there are efficiency advantages of hybrid systems that
combine price and quantity instruments in the presence of uncertainty.
In the United States, [the failure of Congress to pass cap-and-trade
climate legislation in 2010 was essentially collateral damage from a
much larger political war]{.underline}. Implications for Climate Change
Policy Two highly relevant lessons from [[thirty years of]{.mark}
experience with [cap-and-trade]{.mark} systems]{.underline} stand out.
First, cap and trade [[has proven itself to be]{.mark} environmentally
[effective]{.mark} [and]{.mark} economically
[cost-effective]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}relative to traditional
command-and-control approaches. Moreover, [less flexible systems would
not have led to the technological change]{.underline} and innovation
that appear to have been induced by market-based instruments. Second,
and equally important, the performance of cap-and-trade systems depends
on how well they are designed. In particular, it is important to reduce
unnecessary price volatility to avoid excessive costs. Hybrid designs
offer an attractive option to do this if some variability of emissions
can be tolerated. All of this suggests that [cap and trade merits
serious consideration]{.underline} when countries, states, provinces, or
regions around the world develop policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. And, indeed, this has happened. However, as mentioned above,
proposals for such policies have often triggered significant opposition.
In the United States, the failure of Congress to pass cap-and-trade
climate legislation in 2010 was essentially collateral damage from a
much larger political war that decimated the ranks of both moderate
Republicans and moderate Democrats. Nevertheless, [political [support
for]{.mark} using [cap]{.mark}-[and-trade]{.mark} systems to reduce GHG
emissions [has emerged]{.mark}]{.underline} in many other parts of the
world. In fact, in the negotiations leading up to the 2015 UN Climate
Conference in Paris, many parties endorsed key roles for carbon markets
and broadly agreed on the value of linking those markets. It is
certainly possible that three decades of high receptivity to cap and
trade in the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world will
turn out to have been only a relatively brief departure from long-term
reliance on command-and-control environmental regulation. However,
[[considering the]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[positive
experience]{.mark} with cap and trade]{.underline}, we are cautiously
optimistic that the denigration of cap and trade in US political debates
may turn out to be a temporary departure from the long-term trend of
increasing reliance on market-based environmental policy instruments. We
are hopeful, but only time will tell.

The **[[Missteps]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [Why Cap-and-Trade Often
**[Falls Short]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Cap-and-trade]{.underline} is not inherently flawed, but it is
**[[vulnerable to poor execution]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Five key
missteps]{.underline} have repeatedly undermined performance:

1[. **[Over-Allocation of Permits]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[Political resistance]{.underline} to strong caps often [leads
[governments to issue **too many free permits**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in
the early phases of implementation]{.underline}. This
[[dilutes]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[scarcity]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[drives price discovery]{.underline} and emissions reductions.

Example: The EU ETS Phase I (2005--2007) saw member states grant more
permits than actual emissions. The [[market price of carbon collapsed to
nearly zero,]{.underline} [eliminating the incentive]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [reduce emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} and shaking
public trust.

2\. [[Weak or]{.underline} **[Unstable Price
Signals]{.underline}**]{.mark}

At the [[heart of any effective cap-and-trade system is a price
signal]{.underline}]{.mark}---the market-determined cost of emitting one
ton of pollution. In economic theory, [prices do far more than
facilitate transactions]{.underline}; they act as [information carriers,
aggregating the complex web of trade-offs]{.underline} made by
consumers, producers, regulators, and innovators. This
[insight]{.underline}, championed by economists like Friedrich Hayek,
[underscores that prices are not just]{.underline}
[numbers]{.underline}---they are dynamic signals of scarcity, demand,
innovation potential, and opportunity cost.

A [strong and stable carbon price is essential]{.underline} because it
[tells firms and investors]{.underline} the [true cost of
polluting]{.underline} and the real value of clean alternatives.
[When]{.underline} the [price]{.underline} of emissions [is
credible]{.underline} and predictable, [companies can justify long-term
investments]{.underline} in clean technologies, infrastructure upgrades,
and supply chain transformation. [It creates certainty]{.underline} and
urgency, [both]{.underline} of which [are critical]{.underline} for
innovation and emissions reductions.

[However]{.underline}, [[when carbon prices are **weak**]{.underline},
**[volatile]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
**[distorted]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [they fail to signal the need for
change]{.underline}. [[Firms may continue **business as
usual**]{.underline},]{.mark} [choosing cheaper but dirtier energy
sources]{.underline} because the [market gives them no reason not
to]{.underline}. **[Worse]{.underline}**[, [volatility in permit prices
can **paralyze decision-making**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as [companies
hedge against uncertainty]{.underline} instead of investing in progress.

Example: In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, emissions across
Europe fell as industrial activity slowed. But because the EU Emissions
Trading System had no effective mechanism to adjust permit supply, the
market was flooded with unused allowances. As a result, the price of
carbon plunged---at one point dropping below €5 per ton. This price was
too low to incentivize meaningful emissions reductions, and investments
in clean technology stalled. Without a reliable price signal, the system
became a formality rather than a driver of change.

Lesson: To maintain the integrity of cap-and-trade systems, policymakers
must ensure price stability mechanisms are in place. Tools like price
floors set a minimum cost for pollution, ensuring the carbon market
continues to shape behavior even during economic downturns.
Auction-based allocation reduces the distortion caused by free permits
and reflects real market demand. Market Stability Reserves (MSRs)---as
adopted by the EU ETS in 2017---allow regulators to remove surplus
permits during periods of low demand, maintaining price integrity and
restoring confidence in the system.

In sum, a cap without a coherent price signal is like a compass with a
broken needle. Cap-and-trade systems only work when the price of
pollution consistently and transparently reflects its social cost---and
when that price is allowed to guide the millions of decentralized
decisions made by firms, innovators, and consumers across the economy.

The Struggle of **[[Goodhart's Law]{.underline}]{.mark}**

British economist Charles Goodhart famously observed: "**[[When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good
measure]{.underline}]{.mark}**." In the context of cap-and-trade, this
is [more than a theoretical warning]{.underline}---it [reflects a real
risk to the credibility of emissions]{.underline}
[monitoring]{.underline} and pricing systems. [When permit
prices]{.underline} or emissions levels [become the primary targets
for]{.underline} political or regulatory [performance]{.underline},
[actors]{.underline} may [**[manipulate inputs]{.underline}**---[such as
banking allowances, lobbying for looser caps, or engineering short-term
reductions]{.underline}]{.mark}---[at the expense of
long-term]{.underline} [outcomes]{.underline}. This
[undermines]{.underline} the **[[quality of the price
signal]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the informational value of the metric
itself. Effective program design must guard against this by building in
feedback loops, independent oversight, and adaptive mechanisms that
preserve the price signal as a reflection of actual environmental and
economic trade-offs---not just a policy scoreboard.

3\. [**[Complexity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Administrative
Burden]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[[Cap-and-trade]{.underline}]{.mark} systems [[hinge on the
**credibility of their enforcement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To work as
intended, [they require robust monitoring]{.underline},
[reporting]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [verification]{.underline}
(MRV) frameworks that [track emissions, validate compliance, and ensure
environmental integrity]{.underline}. But as Thomas Sowell emphasizes in
Knowledge and Decisions, [monitoring is not free]{.underline}---it
[incurs **administrative**]{.underline}, [**technological**, and
**political** costs.]{.underline} The key, Sowell argues, is that the
[cost of oversight]{.underline} [must be justified]{.underline} by the
value of the trade-offs it secures.

In the case of cap-and-trade, the [benefits of market
flexibility]{.underline} and cost-efficiency are [only realized when
participants trust that everyone is playing by the same
rules.]{.underline} That means the system must be both rigorous and
accessible. [**[However]{.underline}**, [many
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}---especially early on---[struggled to
strike this balance]{.underline}.

[Larger emitters]{.underline} often [[have the legal, financial, and
technical resources]{.underline} [to navigate complex reporting
protocols]{.underline}]{.mark} and secure favorable treatment.

[Smaller businesses]{.underline}, municipalities, and frontline
communities may lack the same access or expertise. As a result, they
[are frequently **underrepresented**]{.underline} [in program
benefits]{.underline} or burdened by compliance challenges.

[[Excessive complexity]{.underline}]{.mark} can [lead]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline} [regulatory]{.underline}
**[bottlenecks]{.underline}**, [reduced]{.underline}
**[participation]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[diminished]{.underline}**]{.mark} [environmental impact]{.underline}.
Worse, when [compliance costs]{.underline} [outweigh]{.underline}
[perceived benefits,]{.underline} public **[[support
erodes]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[undermining]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[long-term stability]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the system.

Recognizing this, many successful cap-and-trade programs have adopted a
test-and-learn approach. Rather than assume a perfect design upfront,
regulators build in feedback loops that allow for iterative adjustments
to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary burdens. This adaptive
governance model ensures that MRV protocols are right-sized---rigorous
enough to maintain integrity, but not so onerous that they stifle
participation or innovation.

Ultimately, the administrative burden of cap-and-trade is not a
flaw---it is a design variable. When approached thoughtfully, monitoring
becomes an investment, not a cost: one that secures trust, ensures
fairness, and enables the market to deliver on its environmental
promise.

4\. **[[Market Manipulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Speculation

[Like any market]{.underline}, [carbon trading]{.underline} is [subject
to strategic behavior]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline}
[entities]{.underline} bank allowances, [speculate on future
prices]{.underline}, [or [**lobby** for regulatory
loopholes]{.mark}]{.underline}[---]{.mark}[undermining environmental
goals]{.underline}.

5\. **[[Equity Failures]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[Localized Harm]{.underline}**

Perhaps the [[most serious critique]{.underline}]{.mark} of
cap-and-trade is its [potential to **[exacerbate environmental
injustice]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [While]{.underline}]{.mark} [total
emissions may fall]{.underline}, [pollution can concentrate in specific
communities]{.underline}, especially near heavy industry.

[Example]{.underline}: [In California]{.underline},
[studies]{.underline} have [shown]{.underline} that [some
[**low-income** and minority communities]{.underline} [experienced
**increased local pollution**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[even
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[state's]{.underline} [**overall emissions
dropped**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Solution: Include place-based safeguards, geographically targeted
reinvestments, and air quality co-benefits to ensure pollution
reductions are felt where they are needed most.
