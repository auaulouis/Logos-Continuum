#### States have no incentives to produce bioengineered pathogens

- PEPP = pathogens with enhanced pandemic potential

Aa Yassif, Korol, and Kane note, creating effective disincentives
against the development of any bioweapon requires first understanding
the motives of states to develop it. [A state might develop or procure
bioweapons to deploy them as offensive weapons or stock them to deter
aggression from other states]{.underline}. Under conditions of mistrust,
states may also develop bioweapons if they worry that other states may
come to possess bioweapons, leading to an arms race dynamic.

[The highly lethal, transmissible, and indiscriminate nature of the
worst PEPPs weakens, at least on the face of it, all these incentives
for state agents to develop them as a form of bioweaponry]{.underline}.
First, consider how the highly transmissible and lethal nature of the
worst bioweapons will undermine their usefulness as a strategic weapon.
[Insofar as a state genuinely wishes to protect the well-being of its
citizens, or at least its leaders, understanding that highly
transmissible pathogens are likely to infect them too should motivate it
not to deploy bioweapons]{.underline}. (In addition, the state's allies
are unlikely to sanction the state's use of PEPPs, given allies'
concerns for their own health.) Here, highly infectious PEPPs contrast
with old-school bioweapons such as anthrax, for example, whose limited
transmissibility could keep attackers safe.

Perhaps states may still have incentives to develop PEPP bioweapons as a
form of deterrent. For a weapon to function as a deterrent, it is
essential that other states believe that the state developing the
bioweapon will use the weapon if sufficiently provoked. Yet if other
states are aware of a state's prudential reasons not to release PEPPs,
then they would not normally believe that their adversaries are likely
to release them even if provoked. [No state minimally concerned for the
health of its citizens or leaders would willingly release highly lethal
and transmissible pathogens anywhere. Mutual knowledge of this
consideration would remove the entire deterrence advantage of having
bioweapons]{.underline}.

[Such mutual knowledge would therefore impede a PEPP bioweapons arms
race as well.]{.underline} Arms races typically occur because states
wish to avoid a situation in which they lack a weapons program that
other states have. Yet this situation is only objectionable for a state
when it leaves it vulnerable to attacks. [When a state knows that other
states cannot afford to use their superior PEPP weapons stockpiles, it
also knows that it need not build its own program. In short, even if
states suspect that other states are developing the worst PEPP
bioweapons, they lack the incentives to enter a PEPP bioweapons arms
race. And if a state fears that a rogue individual is developing or in
possession of a PEPP bioweapon, responding to that threat with its own
PEPP threats is pointless.]{.underline} A state cannot afford to use
that weapon against the individual---and the individual will know that.

What states do gain from developing and possessing PEPPs as weapons is
lots of risk. Accidental release is possible, as is the misuse of the
technology by adversaries, including terrorist groups. Taken together,
this means that, [typically, states not only lack reasons to develop
PEPPs but they also have significant reasons not to develop them.
Strategically and tactically, the costs of PEPP weapons far exceed their
benefits.]{.underline} Thus, a likely effective, relatively inexpensive,
and readily implementable means of disincentivizing the development of
the worst PEPP bioweapons would be to promulgate these calculations to
all states.

Though permafrost slows nucleic acid degradation, [significant damage
still occurs in the form fragmentation, crosslinking, and lesion
accumulation]{.underline} (62). DNA extracted from ancient faunal
remains contains a mix DNA from the animal itself, microorganisms
(including viruses) present at the time of death, and microorganisms
introduced postmortem (59, 73, 74). This [DNA is typically highly
fragmented, usually less than a few hundred base pairs in length but
often much smaller]{.underline} (73--77). [RNA, when recoverable, is
even more degraded]{.underline} (78). [Even remains preserved soon after
death experience nucleic acid damage]{.underline} (79, 80), [which
accumulates over time]{.underline} (59).

Most well-preserved animal specimens found in permafrost date back to
the late Pleistocene (between 11,700 and 129,000 years ago) and early
Holocene (between 8,200 and 11,700 years ago) (68, 81, 82). These
timeframes exceed the expected survival of fully intact nucleic acids
from viral and other microbial sources unless they are protected by
stress-resistant forms (e.g., capsids that shield against harsh
extracellular environments or cysts) or they have low levels of
metabolic activity that enable DNA repair (79, 83, 84). [Unlike viruses
associated with microbial hosts in permafrost (discussed in the next
section), animal viruses lack adaptations to the permafrost environment
and do not have the protection of a cold-adapted host that can perform
DNA repair or enter dormancy]{.underline} (11, 79, 83, 85, 86).

[In stark contrast to the hypothetical risk posed by viruses from
thawing permafrost, viruses circulating among wild and domestic animals
have repeatedly jumped into human hosts, causing disease
outbreaks.]{.underline} Examples include the viruses causing coronavirus
disease 2019, Ebola, and avian influenza (87--89). [This suggests that
risks of disease outbreaks from viruses of animal origin are much more
likely to stem from contact with extant wildlife (direct or indirect) in
the Arctic and subarctic rather than emergence from
permafrost]{.underline} (90, 91).

Representatives of fungal insect pathogens have also been detected in
ancient Siberian permafrost.66,68 Some taxs were putative colonizers of
skin or dung of mammals, potentially reflecting the presence of a range
of insect and other animal species that thrived at the time (Pleistocene
to early Holocene eras). Lydolph et al.68 studied ancient DNA from a
permafrost tunnel in Siberia that ranged from the modern age to 400,000
years ago. [They also found ancient DNA with fungal representatives of
coprophilic and keratophilic fungi as well as plant
pathogens]{.underline}. The main representatives were from the
Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, and Zygomycetes phyla. [However, to our
knowledge, no active fungal pathogens in permafrost that directly infect
humans have been reported to date.]{.underline}

"There was a nematode resuscitated from permafrost and was alive, a
40,000 year old roundworm. One thing to think about is that free living
organisms are designed to survive more in the environment than
pathogens," Jenkins said. "Like the roundworms, are [those so called
zombie viruses. They\'re actually **not pathogens** of people or even
animals.They\'re either free living or the viruses in particular, were
actually **viruses of amoeba**. So it is quite a big stretch to jump
from those things surviving to pathogens. The risk is not zero, but
it\'s **low probability."**]{.underline}

years](https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article-abstract/11/1/12/14496/Hydro-Political-Hyperbole-Examining-Incentives-for?redirectedFrom=fulltext),
[and despite such "[water wars]{.mark}" **[never]{.mark}** having
[happened]{.mark}, hypotheses about them keep cropping up around
conflict-affected regions such as the Middle East and South
Asia]{.underline}. In reality, conflicts are multidimensional with
social, political, economic, and ecological drivers producing conflicts
through their complex interrelations. Because of these multidimensional
conflict drivers, the water war message is wrong-headed and needlessly
scaremongering. **What Is the Contemporary 'Water Wars' Hypothesis and
What's Wrong With It?** Defense ministers, military generals, NGOs, UN
Secretaries-General and environment-focused academics all repeat the
misguided hypothesis that increasing [resource scarcity leads to
conflict](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210816-how-water-shortages-are-brewing-wars).
Since Al Gore's [*Inconvenient
Truth*](https://www.amazon.com/Inconvenient-Truth-Al-Gore/dp/B000KZ3BWE)
movie, the narrative keeps expanding to include climate-induced mass
migration, climate disasters, and even [climate
wars](https://www.dw.com/en/un-climate-change-increases-risk-of-violent-conflict/a-59286176).
Indian geostrategist [Brahma Chellaney has recently]{.underline} [argued
that water is the new
oil](https://openthemagazine.com/cover-stories/the-water-wars/) [and
claims that [water will]{.mark} be the centerpiece of power struggle in
Asia.]{.underline} This year, tensions between Ethiopia, Sudan, and
Egypt over [filling the enormous Grand Ethiopian Renaissance
Dam](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/6/egypt-angry-ethiopia-resumes-filling-gerd)
on the Nile River has also refueled water war theories. After the summer
floods in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, European Commissioner
Frans Timmermans repeatedly predicted that there will be [future wars
over food and
water](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/30/climate-crisis-we-must-make-sacrifices-to-avoid-future-wars-says-eu-deputy-frans-timmermans)
unless there are 55 percent reductions in carbon dioxide emissions by
2030. Military analysts such as retired Dutch General Tom Middendorp,
chairman of the International Military Council on Climate and Security,
has repeatedly [aligned himself with the water
wars](https://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2323119-water-gaat-vaker-bron-zijn-van-conflicten)
(and climate-induced mass migration)
[discourse](https://www.globe-eu.org/wp-content/uploads/Opening-address-Tom-Middendorp.pdf).
The [Water, Peace, and Security](https://waterpeacesecurity.org/map)
Partnership was set up by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
the German Agency for International Cooperation and a consortium of six
partners to forecast and understand water-related conflicts and
organized violence[. Climate change will intensify weather extremes, but
extremes alone do [not cause violent conflict.]{.mark} As Dr. Clionadh
Raleigh of Sussex University said, "It's just a simplistic,]{.underline}
[nonsense
narrative](http://www.ipsnews.net/2014/08/will-climate-change-lead-to-conflict-or-cooperation/)
[that the climate makes people violent." Violence is only one, rarely
used coping strategy for stress and sudden change.]{.underline} Multiple
factors have to interact in complex ways before they create an
escalating crisis. And even then, as Professor Aaron Wolf's extensive
Oregon State University database shows, [states have not gone to war
over
water](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-4219-9_18)
only. As Naho Mirumachi has shown, a [mix of conflict and cooperation is
more
likely](https://www.soas.ac.uk/water/publications/papers/file39696.pdf).
Water as a Pawn in Multidimensional Conflicts In Afghanistan, water
stress is a prominent issue and water resources and infrastructure often
fall victim to local and wider geopolitical conflict. Afghanistan shares
the transboundary Harirud River with Turkmenistan and Iran, with which
it shares a [hostile
relationship](https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/13/no-friend-of-iran-tehrans-responses-to-the-talibans-return-to-power-in-afghanistan/).
The Afghan-India Friendship Dam has been targeted by the Taliban
multiple times, including [earlier this
year](https://theprint.in/world/taliban-seize-of-herat-puts-afghan-india-friendship-dam-and-water-to-thousands-at-risk/714519/).
Such violence not only slowed down progress on the project, it also
serves a strategic advantage: as dams are highly visible symbols of
state presence and development, attacking them immediately captures the
global attention. The reason to target the Friendship Dam appears to
have been to attack the [Indian
reconstruction](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-troops-foil-another-attack-on-india-built-salma-dam-101628087863319.html)
efforts in Afghanistan, rather than to initiate a water war. The attack
on water infrastructure shows Taliban's political alignment towards
Pakistan and not India, challenging in a way the geo-political position
of India in South Asia. In this case, water is used as a tactical
leverage point to strangle India's approach to becoming a leader in the
region. Such concerted violence on water infrastructure echoes the
Turkish Atatürk mega dam construction works targeted in 1984 by the
Kurdish insurrection fighters
[PKK](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8ZG6Q7N). The
Kurdish population in Southeast Turkey has been struggling for
independence from Turkey for many decades, and many Kurds saw the dam
project as a symbol of Turkish oppression and an invasion of their
territory. Attacks on the dam during construction were not solely
*about* the dam. The dam was a target in a much bigger chess game,
fueled by a sense of marginalization, territory, identity, and Kurdish
independence. Despite all claims of imminent water war in Asia, water
treaties have survived wars and military insurgency between arch-rivals
for decades. The [Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan has
survived three major
wars](https://thewire.in/external-affairs/india-pakistan-indus-waters-treaty-world-bank-water-sharing)
(in 1965, 1971, and 1999) between the countries. There has been
controversy over dam construction, but the underlying issues in these
cases were an escalation of the disputed territory and insurgency in the
Kashmir valley. There have been instances where India has attempted to
scare its neighbor by threatening to stop water from the eastern rivers.
For instance, after the 2016 attack on a military base in Uri (Kashmir),
Narendra Modi said, "[Blood and Water cannot flow
simultaneously](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/indus-water-treaty-blood-and-water-cant-flow-together-pm-modi-pakistan-uri-attack/),"
implying that India would stop water flow on the Indus and other rivers
shared with Pakistan. Fortunately, India did not follow through on the
threat. In these and other incidents water was not the cause of the
conflict between the two countries, but was used as leverage in the
dispute over Kashmir or other insurgent activity. The river was a stake
in a territorial power game. Likewise, water is often involved but not
the primary driver in
[disputes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56147309) between India
and China. For instance, the sharing of water data on the Brahmaputra
River was drawn into a border dispute when China stopped sharing data
after the 2017 military standoff in
[Doklam](https://warontherocks.com/2018/06/doklam-one-year-later-chinas-long-game-in-the-himalayas/).
(The Chinese army attempted to build a road through disputed territory
in the Doklam plateau and Indian soldiers based nearby stopped the
Chinese crew, resulting in the military standoff.) Following this event,
the Chinese stopped providing the hydrological data used for flood
forecasting by India. China agreed to resume sharing hydrological data
only after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi
Jinping held discussions in April 2018 in
[Wuhan](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-narendra-modi-meets-chinese-president-xi-on-sidelines-of-sco-summit/articleshow/64520120.cms?from=mdr).
Hydrological data sharing became the symbolic victim in the military and
diplomatic standoff over territorial issues between India and China.
[**[Promoting the False Narrative of Water Wars is Damaging]{.mark}**
The problem is that the choice of words, ideas, and narratives built on
projections of water wars [have **consequences**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If repeated enough in an echo chamber, the false claims may become
self-fulfilling prophecies. [[If we lend credence]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the water [war narrative,]{.mark} will [nations]{.mark} [eventually send
troops to prevent them]{.mark}? Will we [then divert military, economic,
and humanitarian resources]{.mark} to defending the water war narrative
rather than using those resources to bring resolution to what conflicts
are truly about---the underlying social, political, economic, and
ecological challenges? [The hype over water]{.mark} and climate
**[wars]{.mark} [must stop!]{.mark}**]{.underline} [By]{.mark} sounding
the alarm over water wars and attributing them only to climate change,
we detract from the lamentable shortcomings of water governance and
politics in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Instead of militarizing water
scarcity, we should be promoting the truer narrative that we produce our
own water scarcity crisis and have all the tools for alleviating it.
Conflict is multidimensional. The construction of simple, one-sided
threats generally favors [military
forces](https://www.planetarysecurityinitiative.org/sites/default/files/2020-10/CA_PSI_Militarisation_of_CC.pdf).
Military intervention can distract and divert resources from issues like
human security and governance of natural resources. Instead, we must
work to improve water distribution, ensure better water governance for
all, and counter degradation and appropriation (capture) by
elites---even though [[water **is not** going to spark nor determine

"THE WATER WARS MYTH"
[https://www.openmindmag.org/articles/the-water-wars-myth//\[fifa](https://www.openmindmag.org/articles/the-water-wars-myth//%5bfifa)

"[Water shortages are brewing
wars](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210816-how-water-shortages-are-brewing-wars),"
warned the BBC last year[. [People who worry about climate change are
drawn to this **dramatic**, high-stakes
idea]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} After all, persistent droughts and
destructive floods are symptoms of a changing climate, and it seems
irresistibly intuitive to claim that when water becomes scarce or
unpredictable, states will go to war with each other to secure it. [But
by [paying so much attention to an exaggerated,]{.mark} simplistic
[scenario]{.mark} (even with good intentions), [we miss the **true
risks**]{.mark} of water shortages and the solutions at
hand]{.underline}. Take the current conflict in Ukraine,
[described](https://www.eurasiareview.com/22042022-potential-of-water-wars-and-conflicts-oped/)
by some people as a conflict over water: Russia intervened, they say, to
ensure Crimea would get water that Ukraine has been holding back since
2014. But alleged causes of the ongoing invasion also include economics,
identity, history, security, and an unhinged dictator. This does not
mean that water is immaterial. Water infrastructure can be a target in
war, as when Russian forces cut off Mariupol from its water supply to
conquer the city. Water can also be weaponized, as both Ukrainian and
Russian forces have done by breaching dams to flood the landscape and
shift the odds in the ground fight. And, of course, localized conflicts
can ignite over water when institutions collapse, as when Russian-backed
separatists took over parts of the Donbass region in 2014, cutting in
half the Soviet-era integrated water system that served it. [History is
littered with examples](https://www.worldwater.org/conflict/list/) of
times when water, or the infrastructure designed to manage it, played
some role in war. But that is not the same as being the *cause* of an
international war. Attributing wars to water scarcity implies that
material conditions inevitably determine armed conflict, when in fact
military aggression is almost always a matter of choice. Blaming war on
water absolves politicians of their responsibility and deprives people
of their agency, undermining efforts to resolve the very conflicts water
is supposedly driving. There are [310 river
basins](https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/sites/transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/files/Database/Data/register/McCracken_Wolf_2019.pdf)
straddling national boundaries, covering nearly half of the earth's land
surface and home to half of humanity. [Many of those rivers are under
stress](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019EF001321)
today. Focusing on them as possible theaters of war---as the "water
wars" story would have it---diverts us from seeing them for what they
could be: 310 instruments of peace. In fact, cooperation rather than
conflict is the most common response to a difficult water situation. In
contemporary culture, the thesis of a war over water has a modern
archetype: the Arab--Israeli conflict. The Jordan River, more than 300
kilometers long, is fed by tributaries in southern Lebanon and Syria and
flows into the Sea of Galilee. From there it receives water from two
more tributaries on its eastern bank---the Yarmouk and the Zarqa---and
runs along borders that, after the armistice in 1949, separated Israel
and the West Bank on one side from Jordan on the other. In the early
1950s, both Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan began drawing from that
system to support economic development. Jordan announced plans to divert
the Yarmouk. Two years later, Israel began construction of its National
Water Carrier, a system of pipelines and canals that would draw water
mainly from the Sea of Galilee. These developments were not meant as
threats, but [they set the stage for what happened
next](https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/olj/meria/meria_jun05/meria05_seo01.pdf).
By 1956, with Israel's Carrier system still under construction, Egypt
had blocked Israeli ships from passing through the trade route of the
Suez Canal. Amid growing tensions, in 1964 Egyptian president Gamal
Nasser convened a summit of Arab states---a meeting notable for the
birth of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Famously, participants
declared that the continued economic development of Israel would
displace more Palestinians and pose an existential threat to the Arab
world. One way to constrain Israel's development was to divert the
Syrian headwaters of the Jordan River, reducing the amount reaching the
Sea of Galilee by about a third and limiting what Israel could draw for
its Carrier system. With construction of the system finally completed,
Israel declared the diversion an infringement of its sovereign rights.
Things escalated, and in May 1967 Nasser's troops surrounded Israel.
During the Six Day War that followed, Israel destroyed the Syrian
diversion and took over the Golan Heights, West Bank, Gaza Strip, and
Sinai, vastly extending its control over the region. This not only
secured control of the Jordan River but gave Israel access to the
aquifers below the West Bank. Its National Water Carrier had even more
room to grow. Water clearly played a key role in this conflict. The Arab
attempt to divert the headwaters weaponized the river's sources. But
water was not the *cause* of the conflict. Water in the Jordan valley
has always been scarce. It took the carving up of the Middle East,
Israel's quest for statehood, Arab nations' refusal to recognize it, and
Egypt's desire for Arab unity and expansion to fuel war. Besides, the
very same war offered an important, if incomplete, example of how
difficult water conditions could facilitate peace. Following 1978
negotiations at Camp David, Anwar Sadat, Nasser's successor as president
of Egypt, resurrected an old water plan, offering Israel its Nile waters
to develop the Negev desert in the hopes of finding a workable
compromise for regional stability. Sadat was assassinated in 1981 and
nothing came of the offer, but the attempt showed how water scarcity
could be a precursor to cooperation rather than a cause of conflict.
Despite this, the "water wars" thesis held sway, attracting serious
public attention when Sadat claimed that water was "the only matter that
could take Egypt to war again." In 1985 Sadat's former minister of state
for foreign affairs, Boutros Boutros-Ghali (later the secretary general
of the United Nations), reprised this statement, claiming that the
*next* war in the Middle East "will be fought over water, not politics,"
a thinly veiled threat to states along the Nile. Then, in 1995, during a
speech to water experts in Stockholm, another Egyptian, World Bank Vice
President Ismaïl Serageldin, claimed that "if the wars of the 20th
century were fought over oil, "[the wars of the 21st century will be
fought over water](http://www.serageldin.com/water.htm)." Serageldin
wasn't literally predicting a water war; he was drawing people's
attention to the importance of water management. This time the
alliterative phrase was picked up widely by media, including the *New
York Times*, *Newsweek*, and CNN. **Cooperation, not conflict, is the
recurrent theme when nations share a water source.** ublic fascination
with the idea of a water war led academics to investigate its empirical
basis. Scholars dug into the past to find evidence of military conflicts
between nations over water. The very first water war in recorded history
was described in the *Stele of Vultures*. The stele is a Sumerian
monument from about 4,500 years ago whose fragments are at the Louvre in
Paris. It tells the story of what could be called a water war between
Umma and Lagash, two city-states in lower Mesopotamia, between Baghdad
and Basra in modern Iraq. But the geographer Aaron Wolf of Oregon State
University, a prominent expert in water-related conflicts,
[wrote](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-4219-9_18)
that if this was the first water war, it was also the last.
Overwhelmingly, the [evidence that Wolf and others have
collected](https://iwaponline.com/wp/article-abstract/5/1/29/11563/International-waters-identifying-basins-at-risk)
shows that cooperation, not conflict, is the recurrent theme when
nations share a water source. The most famous example of this took place
in the Indus River valley. More than 3,000 kilometers long, the river
rises in western Tibet and Kashmir, flows through the Punjab in India
and Sindh in Pakistan, and finally empties into the Arabian Sea. One of
the most egregious legacies of the British Raj was that, at the time of
independence for India and Pakistan in 1947, [this river basin was split
between the two
countries](https://ppeh.sas.upenn.edu/1947-partition-india-river-indus-untold-tale)
with no regard for the infrastructure that had turned it into the
largest contiguous irrigation system in the world. Most of the irrigated
land went to Pakistan, but the infrastructure that ended up in India
could stop the flow to its neighbor almost entirely. With no rules of
engagement and no history of joint management, the newly formed states
faced severe tensions over water, among other things. Ethnicity itself
caused a crisis. In what has been called the biggest migration of the
century, an estimated 15 million people moved across the new border in a
matter of months. Hindus moved to India and Muslims to Pakistan while
community ethnic cleansing left a long trail of victims and hatred along
the migration paths. It was an inauspicious start to separation, but the
two countries had no choice. They had to manage the shared river, and
that is what they did. In 1960, after protracted negotiations, Field
Marshal Ayub Khan of Pakistan and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of
India [signed the Indus Waters
Treaty](https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0016-7398.2002.00060.x).
The treaty divided the tributaries of the river between the two
countries, established a World Bank infrastructure financing package to
reengineer the river in service of both, and, crucially, adopted
mechanisms for arbitration so that neither country could pose an
existential threat to the other. It was imperfect, as all international
agreements are. Yet it was a treaty between two countries that would
soon become nuclear powers. Remarkably, it has withstood the test of
time, surviving the conflict of 1965, the independence of Bangladesh in
1971, and the Kargil conflict of 1999. It stands to this day as an
extraordinary monument to cooperation between rivals that work together
on the river, even when at war over other things. Popular culture has
drawn the wrong lesson from history. [[A fear of "water wars" is a
**misreading** of water events.]{.mark}]{.underline} From the Jordan to
the Indus to the [Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers,](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/97/1/139/6041469?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
shared among Turkey, Iraq, and Syria, the lesson is always the same:
Even the most difficult of neighbors can find a route to cooperation
over water. This does not make it easy, nor is it inevitable. But [a
[failure to cooperate **does not lead to armed**]{.mark} **international
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead it produces persistent water
insecurity and suffering. Unmanaged scarcity can cripple economies;
uncontrolled floods can destroy communities; both can lead to migration.
[The focus on "water wars" blinds us to the opportunity for
cooperation]{.underline} and the need to encourage it. In the first few
months of 2022, skirmishes have broken out between Taliban and Iranian
forces where the Helmand River crosses the border between Afghanistan
and Iran. The Taliban reacted to alleged attempts at dredging additional
canals. Iranian farmers, in turn, protested over perceived threats to
the water flowing from Afghanistan. [These are not "water wars," though;
localized skirmishes are not unusual when individuals or communities
fight over water, but they happen precisely because states have been
unable to develop effective cooperation.]{.underline} Afghanistan is
struggling with a severe drought and insufficient infrastructure to
manage its own water resources, risking a famine of unprecedented scale.
Over the last few months, a flood not of water but of people, mostly
fleeing the Taliban and hunger, has been crossing the border out of the
country. The high number of refugees is putting further pressure on
Iranian communities, which then react with anti-Afghan protests,
compounding tensions. The management of water resources is central to
overcoming these problems. It is a cure for conflict, not a cause. What
[these neighbors need are better institutions to support
cooperation](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Water_Dispute_Escalating_between_Iran_and_Afghanistan_web_0830.pdf),
reliable data to manage the river, and institutions to negotiate joint
river management as the flow changes over time. Cooperation is the key
to survival. From the Helmand, the Jordan, and the Nile to the Mekong
between China and its neighbors downstream to all the other
international rivers worldwide, water offers an opportunity to cooperate
across borders. In the face of climate change and deteriorating water
security, the real challenge is not war but successful cooperation.
That, above all, will safeguard the future of the shared waters of the
world.

Colorado Boulder, about the Golden Dome plan and the feasibility of
Trump's claims. Boyd receives funding for research unrelated to Golden
Dome from defense contractor Lockheed Martin.

Why does the United States need a missile shield?

Several countries, including China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, have
been developing missiles over the past few years that challenge the
United States' [current missile defense
systems](https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/nasams-defence-system-norway/).

These weapons include updated ballistic missiles and cruise missiles,
and new hypersonic missiles. They have been specifically developed to
counter America's highly advanced missile defense systems such as
the [Patriot](https://science.howstuffworks.com/patriot-missile.htm) and
the [National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile
System](https://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/nasams-defence-system-norway/).

For example, the new hypersonic missiles are very high speed, operate in
a region of the atmosphere where nothing else flies and are
maneuverable. All of these aspects combined create a new challenge that
requires a new, updated defensive approach.

Russia has [fired hypersonic
missiles](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/nato-and-ukraine-to-hold-emergency-talks-after-russias-attack-with-new-hypersonic-missile) against
Ukraine in the ongoing conflict. China [parades its new hypersonic
missiles](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/china-showcases-fearsome-new-missiles-to-counter-us-at-military-parade-idUSKBN1WG342/) in
Tiananmen Square.

So it's reasonable to think that, to ensure the protection of its
homeland and to aid its allies, the U.S. may need a new missile defense
capability.

What are the components of a national missile defense system?

Such a defense system requires a global array of geographically
distributed sensors that cover all phases of all missile trajectories.

First, it is [essential for the [system to **detect** the
missile]{.mark} threats as [**early as possible** after launch]{.mark},
so some of the [sensors must be located close to regions where
adversaries may fire them]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} by China,
[Russia]{.mark}, North Korea and Iran. Then, it has to [track the
missiles along their trajectories]{.mark} as they travel hundreds or
thousands of miles]{.underline}.

These requirements are met by [[deploying]{.mark} a variety of
[sensors]{.mark} on a number of [different platforms]{.mark} on the
[ground, at sea, in the air and in space]{.mark}. Interceptors are
placed in locations that protect vital U.S. assets and usually aim to
engage threats during the middle portion of the trajectory between
launch and the terminal dive.]{.underline}

The U.S. already has a broad array of sensors and interceptors [in place
around the
world](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/current-us-missile-defense-programs-glance) and
in space primarily to protect the U.S. and its allies from ballistic
missiles. [The sensors would need to be expanded, including with more
space-based sensors, to detect new missiles such as hypersonic
missiles.]{.underline} The interceptors would need to be enhanced to
enable them to address hypersonic weapons and other missiles and
warheads that can maneuver.

Does this technology exist?

Intercepting hypersonic missiles specifically involves several steps.

First, as explained above, a hostile missile must be detected and
identified as a threat. Second, the threat must be tracked along all of
its trajectory due to the ability of hypersonic missiles to maneuver.
Third, an interceptor missile must be able to follow the threat and get
close enough to it to disable or destroy it.

The main new challenge here is the ability to track the hypersonic
missile continuously. This requires new types of sensors to detect
hypersonic vehicles and new sensor platforms that are able to provide a
complete picture of the hypersonic trajectory. As described, Golden Dome
would use the sensors in a layered approach in which they are installed
on a variety of platforms in multiple domains, including ground, sea,
air and space.

These various platforms would need to [have [different types of sensors
that are specifically designed to **track hypersonic threats**]{.mark}
in different phases of their flight paths. These [defensive
systems]{.mark} will also be [designed to address weapons]{.mark}
[fired]{.mark} from [space]{.mark}.]{.underline} Much of the
[[infrastructure will be **multipurpose**]{.mark} and able to [defend
against]{.mark} a [**variety** of missile types]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In terms of time frame for deployment, it is important to note that
Golden Dome will build from the long legacy of existing U.S. missile
defense systems. Another important aspect of Golden Dome is that some of
the new capabilities have been under active development for years. In
some ways, Golden Dome represents the commitment to actually deploy
systems for which [considerable
progress](https://news.usni.org/2025/05/20/report-to-congress-hypersonic-missile-defense) has
already been made.

Is near 100% protection a realistic claim?

Israel's [Iron
Dome](https://theconversation.com/israels-iron-dome-air-defense-system-works-well-heres-how-hamas-got-around-it-215512) air
defense system has been described as the most effective system of its
kind anywhere in the world.

But even Iron Dome is not 100% effective, and it has also been
overwhelmed on occasion by Hamas and others who [fire very large numbers
of inexpensive
missiles](https://theconversation.com/israels-iron-dome-air-defense-system-works-well-heres-how-hamas-got-around-it-215512) and
rockets at it. So it is unlikely that any missile defense system will
ever provide 100% protection.

The more important goal here is [to achieve
deterrence](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/us-must-upgrade-its-missile-defence-deter-russia-and-china),
similar to the stalemate in the Cold War with the Soviet Union that was
based on nuclear weapons. [All of the new weapons that Golden Dome will
defend against are very expensive. The [U.S.]{.mark} is trying to
[change the calculus]{.mark} in an [opponent's thinking]{.mark} to the
point where [they]{.mark} will [consider it **not worth
shooting**]{.mark} their precious [high-value missiles at the
U.S.]{.mark} when [they know]{.mark} there is a [high
probability]{.mark} of them **[not reaching their
targets]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Is three years a feasible time frame?

That seems to me like a very aggressive timeline, but with multiple
countries now operating hypersonic missiles, there is a real sense of
urgency.

Existing missile defense systems on the ground, at sea and in the air
can be expanded to include new, more capable sensors. Satellite systems
are beginning to be put in place for the space layer. [[Sensors]{.mark}
have been [developed]{.mark} to [track the new missile
threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Putting all of this highly complex system together, however, is likely
to [take more than three
years](https://www.twz.com/space/trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-what-we-just-learned-and-its-implications).
At the same time, if the U.S. fully commits to Golden Dome, a
significant amount of progress can be made in this time.

What does the president's funding request tell you?

President Trump is requesting a total budget for all defense spending
of [about \$1 trillion in
2026](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf).
So, \$25 billion to launch Golden Dome would represent only 2.5% of the
total requested defense budget.

Of course, that is still a lot of money, and a lot of other programs
will need to be terminated to make it possible. But it is certainly
financially achievable.

How will Golden Dome differ from Iron Dome?

Similar to Iron Dome, [[Golden Dome]{.mark} will [consist of
sensors]{.mark} and [interceptor missiles]{.mark} but will be [deployed
over]{.mark} a much **[wider geographical region]{.mark}** and for
defense against a broader variety of threats in comparison with Iron
Dome.]{.underline}

[A second-generation [Golden Dome system]{.mark} in the future would
likely use [[directed energy
weapons]{.mark}](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106717) such as
high-energy lasers and high-power microwaves [to **destroy
missiles**]{.mark}. This approach would [significantly increase
the]{.mark} number of [shots]{.mark} that [defenders]{.mark} can [take
against ballistic, **cruise** and hypersonic
missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: NATO\-\--Dead\-\--1NC

#### NATO is fractured and irrelevant, but at worst, actions from other members thump effectiveness

NATO in the 21st century,\" Al Jazeera, 6-14-2021,

**[[Desperately seeking relevance]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[NATO has been struggling with its]{.mark} ever-evolving [identity
since]{.mark} the end of the [Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Born from a
desire for collective defence and containment of the USSR, its mandate
morphed to include nation-building, peace-keeping, military-civil
relations and the never-ending fight against terrorism and organised
crime, with varying degrees of success.

The original brief -- that of European collective security -- has been
re-invigorated by Russia's military modernisation. In 2014, the
bloodless assimilation of Crimea into Russia, despite it being
overwhelmingly ethnically Russian, sent shockwaves through NATO,
especially among those who are Russia's neighbours and who feel
increasingly nervous that this "assimilation" might one day soon be used
on them.

This has given the Alliance some of its traditional focus back as
collective security within Europe shifts east from Germany and the old
East-West partitions to the new fault lines dividing the increasingly
worried Baltic States and Poland from a resurgent Russia.

Throughout its history, [[NATO has always been]{.mark} a
**[fractious]{.mark} Alliance**]{.underline}. The [[attempts to
consider]{.mark} the]{.underline} national wants and [[needs of
all]{.mark} its [member]{.mark} states]{.underline} at times
[seem]{.underline} an **[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}** task.
Sometimes the desire by a member state for military independence and the
leeway to act in its own interests wins the day.

Key ally and nuclear state [[France left]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1966,
[only to return, under certain conditions, decades later]{.underline} in
2009.

[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}, a vital member of the Alliance, [has
recently [involved]{.mark} itself [in conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} on
its doorstep in Syria and as far away as Libya. In these messy civil
wars, often fought by proxies, [NATO [members]{.mark} have]{.underline}
at times [[found themselves on opposing sides]{.underline}]{.mark} --
the [complicated network of temporary alliances shifting]{.underline}
with remarkable speed.

It is in this climate that [NATO now has to operate]{.underline} -- not
faced, as during the Cold War, with one clearly defined adversary, but
[fighting]{.underline} a patchwork of [local conflicts while maintaining
an ever-growing alliance]{.underline} between countries all with their
own strategic considerations. [[It is little wonder that NATO is **still
struggling**]{.mark} to define itself.]{.underline}

### AT: NATO\-\--Dead\-\--2NC

#### Trump's second term made NATO irrelevant through the collapse of mutual defense and credibility

**Keating 3'17** \[Joshua Keating, Senior Correspondent at Vox covering
foreign policy and world news, previous writer and editor at Slate,
Foreign Policy, Grid, and the Messenger, \"Has Trump already killed
NATO?,\" Vox, 3-17-2025,

erin

At this point, the better question is whether [[Trump]{.mark} has
effectively made the alliance **irrelevant**]{.underline}. The US is
still a NATO member. But [Trump has [consistently **undermined**]{.mark}
**its [core principle]{.mark}** that members will treat any
attack]{.underline} on another member's territory [as an attack on their
own]{.underline}, and come to the attacked member's aid.

This [principle of [mutual defense only works if]{.mark}]{.underline}
both the [allies and]{.underline} their [adversaries
believe]{.underline} that [it's [credible]{.mark}]{.underline} --- that
countries would actually put the lives of their own citizens on the line
to defend allies.

[In the case of [Trump and NATO]{.mark}, the guarantee is getting [a lot
harder to believe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Would Donald Trump choose to go and fight for Estonia?" said Dalibor
Rohac, a senior fellow and expert on European politics at the American
Enterprise Institute. "I think at some level, it requires a suspension
of disbelief to think that he would."

[Trump's [second term]{.mark} has already been **[far more
alarming]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from a European perspective [than the
first,]{.underline} thanks to actions including [Trump's [abrupt pivot
toward Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Ukraine war, the Oval Office
humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his new
[[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}, JD Vance's combative speech at the
Munich Security Conference, the [[territorial threats to]{.mark}ward
[NATO members]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada and Denmark, and reports that
the president is considering [redeploying troops]{.underline} from
Germany to Russia-friendly Hungary.

European leaders might have thought of Trump's first term as an
aberration, a bizarre four years followed by a return to normalcy. [His
return to the White House made clear they may be dealing with a **very
different** U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates going forward ---
one whose security commitments can't be taken for granted in the long
run, even if Trump is replaced by another Joe Biden-style
transatlanticist in four years.

Recent statements from [[European leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} suggest
they [are [not]{.mark} so [confident about]{.mark} the credibility of
[America's]{.mark} [commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} to the alliance. "I
want to believe that the US will stand by our side, but we have to be
ready for that not to be the case," French President Emmanuel Macron
said in a recent televised speech to the nation.

"Strategic autonomy" from Washington has long been a priority for
Macron, and something of a French tradition dating back to the formation
of the alliance. It was more surprising to hear Germany's likely
incoming Chancellor Friedrich [Merz]{.underline}, hailing from a
center-right party with a strong transatlanticist tradition, [say
that]{.underline} "After Donald Trump's statements...it is clear that
the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe" and that
[Europe must work as quickly as possible to "achieve independence from
the US."]{.underline}

Some of this work will involve steps to increase defense spending,
military readiness, and aid to Ukraine that are already underway. There
have also been increasing conversations on the continent about
developing an independent nuclear deterrent, outside of Washington's
control.

Either way, [it's clear that the [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} that has
been the bedrock of Western security strategy for nearly 80 years [[is
no longer what]{.mark} [it was.]{.mark} Without actually leaving it,
[Trump]{.mark} may have simply [**made NATO
irrelevant**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Terror

https://wmdcenter.ndu.edu/Publications/Publication-View/Article/1375207/nuclear-terrorism-imminent-threat/

Yet, [a [terrorist nuclear attack **has not** occurred]{.mark} to
date]{.underline}. Terrorism experts and analysts have debated this for
years, and no consensus exists as to why the world has not seen
terrorists succeed at perpetrating a nuclear attack. Despite the seeming
inevitability of a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon,
[terrorists]{.underline} may be [substantially less likely to conduct
such an attack than most analysts and policymakers expect,]{.underline}
for two overarching reasons:

1.[[Nuclear terrorism]{.mark} is [**difficult to accomplish**, both
technically and operationally]{.mark}]{.underline}. 2. [There is **[no
basis]{.mark}** for a prima facie assumption [that]{.mark} would-be
[nuclear terrorists cannot be disrupted]{.mark}, if not deterred, [from
conducting a nuclear attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Technical and
Operational Difficulties Technical Issues Nuclear terrorism
threats]{.underline} [could take shape in three general
pathways]{.underline}: the deliberate transfer of nuclear material from
a state to a terrorist group or non-state actor; the sale of nuclear
materials to a non-state actor on the black market, which may end up in
the hands of a terrorist group; and, the theft or "leakage," or
unintentional diversion of nuclear material from a state program.5 The
[[question of whether terrorists would be able to steal an actual
nuclear weapon]{.mark} from a nuclear-armed state,]{.underline} while
conceivable[, is [**highly problematic**]{.mark} due to the
extraordinary security afforded nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Attention
usually is drawn to those nuclear states with perceived lessthan-optimal
security over their stockpiles and weapons; and many analysts point out
that the spread of nuclear weapons to North Korea, and potentially Iran,
increases the risk of terrorists getting access to nuclear material or
weapons through collusion with regime officials, or lack of effective
oversight or security. Allied to this is the fear that presently
non-nuclear states will pursue a nuclear weapons program in Asia or the
Middle East to counter North Korea's and Iran's (apparently suspended)
nuclear weapons programs. This possibility would, of course, offer
terrorists potentially more opportunities to acquire a weapon or the
necessary material. However, [the same [reasons why]{.mark} [existing
nuclear states feel dis-incentivized to share nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [terrorist would apply
to]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[nuclear aspirants as
well]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several ongoing efforts take the form of
addressing the supply problem, i.e., the international availability of
fissile and other nuclear-related material. Four Nuclear Security
Summits have been held since President Obama spoke in 2009 of "a new
international effort to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around
the world."6 The fewer sources of fissile material that exist, the
easier it will be to secure the remaining locations from theft or
attack. It is precisely for this reason that the [[U]{.mark}nited

[materials a]{.mark} national **[priority]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Most
of the [international community]{.mark}]{.underline} ostensibly
[[shares]{.mark} this [objective]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The fewer sources of fissile material that exist, the easier it will be
to secure the remaining locations from theft or attack.

[The 2004 United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540
directs states to refrain from "providing any form of support to
non-\[s\]tate actors that attempt to develop, acquire, manufacture,
possess, transport, transfer or use nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons and their means of delivery.]{.underline}" It also [called for
states to adopt and enforce "appropriate effective laws" and "establish
domestic controls" to prevent the proliferation of WMD to non-state
actors]{.underline}.7 The [aims]{.underline} of UNSCR 1540 [have been
institutionalized in efforts]{.underline} [that include]{.underline} the
[legacy Cooperative Threat Reduction programs]{.underline} with the
states of the former Soviet Union, the Russia- [and U.S.-led Global
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and the Proliferation Security
Initiative, to which over 100 states have subscribed]{.underline}. The
["[supply" side of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s production likewise
poses]{.mark} **[significant]{.mark} technical and operational
[challenges]{.mark}** for terrorists]{.underline} pursuing a nuclear
weapon from raw fissile materials. The simplest nuclear device to
assemble would be a crude "gun-type" weapon with a quantity of highly
enriched uranium (HEU).8 The concept is simple enough: by means of high
explosives, drive one mass of HEU into another one, causing the now
super-critical mass of HEU to release its energy in a nuclear
explosion.9 Even so, substantial technical hurdles exist to getting the
HEU into the right physical state, size, shape, and with the necessary
chemical properties to be useful in a gun-type device.10 A possessor of
uranium would have to refine the ore to metallic form, understand any
impurities within its composition, cast it, and then machine it to
precise specifications of size and shape.11

[Terrorists would need access to highly specialized machinery and
equipment in order to manufacture the necessary]{.underline} HEU [for a
nuclear device.]{.underline}

Operational Issues

Unless a state that was a nuclear power provided terrorists with an
already manufactured warhead[, terrorists would need time, a secure
space, and a talented team of engineers, chemists, metallurgists, and
physicists]{.underline}. Highly trained personnel such as these, ideally
with experience in a state's nuclear weapons program, might be able to
be identified as potential recruits to the terrorist organization,
either for money or ideology. It is even quite possible that a few
former weapons designers and engineers would be susceptible to being
recruited by a terrorist group. However, [it is **far from certain**
that an entire weapons design and manufacturing team could be assembled
securely by a terrorist group at one time.]{.underline}

In addition to the actual manufacturing of a device, [**operational
security** would be one of the terrorist groups' **major
challenges.**]{.underline} The [more people involved in what most likely
would be a terrorist organization's most sensitive operation, the more
the risk of detection and disruption by law enforcement or intelligence
personnel.]{.underline} If the group is not adequately walled off or
quarantined (for what likely would be an extended period of time), some
might brag or even just hint at the importance of the project, and this
might be detected.

[Another operational consideration that terrorists would have to contend
with is the **physical movement** of the device to its intended target,
from the safe haven in which it was manufactured. Dozens of national and
international programs have been created after the attacks on September
11, 2001, to monitor the trade routes that supply goods to markets
around the world.]{.underline} [Terrorists would have to conduct
"**complex international operations** involving training, travel, visas,
finances and secure communications"]{.underline} to be able to
accomplish such an operation.21 Even if mechanisms can be thwarted or
bypassed[, the mere perception of a concerted international effort to
find nuclear weapons in the global commons might be expected give a
terrorist group pause as they consider how best to move their
weapon.]{.underline} [Finding]{.underline} a [pathway to move a nuclear
device potentially around the world is not without significant
risk]{.underline} of losing physical control of the cargo, or having it
detected and stopped. Using black market [smuggling routes and
facilitators could be one possible option, but terrorists would face the
attendant risks of losing the shipment to criminal
interlopers]{.underline} who might not know anything about the cargo
other than it had high value to the shipper, and thus could be stolen
from the terrorists

\...it is far from certain that an entire weapons design and
manufacturing team could be assembled securely by a terrorist group at
one time.

A related logistics question is whether the terrorist group would choose
to accompany their cargo throughout the path to its destination. [This
would inevitably raise the profile of the shipment for the necessity of
it being monitored]{.underline}. [Accompanying the shipment will create
**risks** for the terrorists themselves, as they could be identified in
transit by law enforcement or intelligence agencies]{.underline}.
Throughout the journey, [anyone whom the terrorists might consider as
"trusted" accomplices would create more vulnerabilities, as more people
become aware of the importance of the cargo]{.underline}. Knowing these
risks, [if the terrorists decided to send the cargo without physical
accompaniment, they would thus be putting their most valuable cargo into
the international shipping system]{.underline} and hope that the system
delivers the weapon to their designated far-end, witting, recipient for
final preparations and movement to the intended target. Assuming the
worst case---that a terrorist group had the ability to acquire an
adequate supply of appropriate fissile material, and had the time,
space, and talent to manufacture a nuclear device---two key questions
emerge: would it work, and how many would the terrorists want to
produce?

#### The U.S., Democratic leaders, and even authoritarian regimes will not spark a war due to Economic decline. 

John R. **Oneal and** Jaroslav **Tir** 20**06** (John R. Oneal is a
Professor Emeritus with a PhD from Standford University and Jaroslav Tir
is a Professor of Political Science at the University of Colorado
Boulder) Dec. 2006. "Does the Diversionary Use of Force Threaten the
Democratic Peace? Assessing the Effect of Economic Growth on Interstate
Conflict, 1921-2001" http://www.jstor.org/stable/4092778

[Hess and Orphanides]{.underline} (1995, 2001) [offer a clear account of
why [democratic leaders **may be**]{.mark} [inclined to use
force]{.mark} for partisan purposes. When the economy is weak,
incumbents may initiate conflict in order to demonstrate their
war-fighting abilities]{.underline}. Because the public values both
prosperity and security, a diversionary use of force increases the
prospects that a leader will be reelected despite the economic decline.
Hess and Orphanides (1995) report that the United States has been more
apt to become involved in an international crisis when the economy was
in recession and the president had the opportunity to be reelected. They
conclude that, even in a world populated only by democratic states, wars
are likely because a democratic leader, desiring to resurrect his
prospects for reelection, will have no choice but to target another
democracy (Hess and Orphanides 2001).

[The [empirical evidence]{.mark} offered by Hess and Orphanides (1995)
[is **not compelling**, however]{.mark}. [Econ]{.mark}omic [recessions
are statistically related to forceful action by a]{.mark}n incumbent
[U.S]{.mark}. [president in fewer than half]{.mark} [of]{.mark} their
[tests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Economic performance is important in their
model because it affects the popularity of an American leader, which is
the direct measure of his prospects for reelection. Consequently,
[[they]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[correlate]{.mark} the [conflictual
behavior of the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [with the
president\'s public approval]{.mark} [rating]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
association is statistically significant in only one of four tests, and
[this is]{.underline} with [the **[weakest possible]{.mark}**
[standard]{.mark} of statistical significance]{.underline} (.10 with a
one-tailed test). [Even the limited support they report for their
diversionary theory must be treated cautiously because [they rely on
bivariate tests]{.mark} [of **association**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They
do not evaluate their theory within a general model of interstate
conflict, so t[heir findings may be spurious, a result of the
[**omission** of important determinants of
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 Indeed, based on a large sample of
countries in the post-World War I period for which the probability of
conflict is carefully modeled, [Chiozza and Goemans (2003) report that
[democratic leaders are **unlikely to initiate** a crisis when they risk
losing office]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some studies find that, [contrary to diversionary theory, a president is
more likely to use force when his public approval rating is high (Morgan
and Bickers 1992; Morgan and Anderson 1999).\" This is consistent with
traditional analyses of U.S. foreign policy (e.g., George 1971; Blechman
and Kaplan 1978):]{.underline} presidential popularity increases the
president\'s freedom of action because he can be confident that the
public is behind him. In this view, [presidents are more apt to use
force when they are popular, instead of using force to become
popular.]{.underline} [A number of other empirical
analyses,]{.underline} however, [report [**no relationship** between
America\'s involvement in interstate conflict and a president\'s
approval rating]{.mark} (Lindsay, Sayrs, and Steger 1992; Meernik 1994;
2004; Meernik and Waterman 1996; Wang 1996; Fordham 1998a, 1998b;
DeRouen 2000; Moore and Lanoue 2003).]{.underline} The [[evidence
regarding]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[influence of]{.mark}
[econ]{.mark}omic [growth]{.mark} [on the use of force]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} also
[mixed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Fordham]{.underline} (1998a,
1998b) [and DeRouen]{.underline} (1995) [find [**no relation** in the
post-World War II period]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Gowa]{.underline} (1998)
[finds none over a longer temporal span,]{.underline} 1870-1992; but
Fordham (2002) has revised Gowa\'s analyses to show some effect. Clark
(2003) reports evidence for Smith\'s (1996) theory regarding the
importance of strategic interaction, with the United States responding
to diversionary incentives but potential targets acting to limit this
opportunity. On the other hand, [Meernik (2000) concludes that the
[state of the American]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omy [**does not influence**
others\' initiation]{.mark} [of crises with the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. DeRouen and Peake (2002) report that a use
of force diverts the public\'s attention from a poor economy.
[In]{.underline} an early analysis of [pooled data by
Russett]{.underline} (1990a), [slow growth increased the likelihood that
the United States would become involved in militarized
disputes]{.underline}, 1853-1976. [Yet, [slow growth **did not affect**
the behavior of]{.mark} other [democracies]{.mark}, including Great
Britain and France, [or authoritarian countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Miller\'s (1995, 1999) results are quite different: autocracies are
significantly more likely than democracies to use force when economic
growth is slow, and the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is particularly
[**unlikely** to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Oneal and
Russett]{.underline} (1997) reported that slow growth increased the
incidence of militarized disputes for all types of regimes; but [with
more complete data]{.underline} (Russett and Oneal 2001:152-153), they
[[find **no significant relationship**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Leeds and
Davis (1997) conclude that the [conflict-initiating behavior of 18
industrialized democracies is unrelated to]{.mark} either
[econ]{.mark}omic [conditions]{.mark} or the electoral
cycle,]{.underline} and [Pickering and [Kisangani]{.mark}]{.underline}

Vladimir [**[Putin's]{.mark}** attempts to blame the invasion of Ukraine
on NATO are dishonest]{.underline}, according to Norway's army chief,
who argues that the [Russian dictator's **own [actions prove]{.mark}**
[he does not view the alliance as a]{.mark} **genuine security
[threat]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Speaking after a September 16 meeting of NATO commanders in Oslo, the
Norwegian Chief of Defense, General Eirik Kristoffersen, revealed that
Russia has dramatically reduced its military presence on the border with
NATO member Norway. "Vladimir [Putin knows very well that NATO is not a
threat against Russia]{.underline}," commented Kristoffersen. "[If he
believed we were threatening Russia, he couldn't have moved all his
troops to Ukraine]{.underline}."

According to Kristoffersen, [**[Russia]{.mark}** has now
**[withdrawn]{.mark}** approximately **[80% of the force]{.mark}s** it
had previously [stationed close]{.mark} to the **[Norwegian
border]{.mark}** prior to the full-scale invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline} in February 2022. "[Putin has taken this risk
because he knows NATO is not threatening anyone]{.underline}," the
Scandinavian commander stated.

Speaking alongside Kristoffersen, NATO Military Committee Chair Admiral
Rob Bauer noted the similarities between the [withdrawal of Russian
forces from the Norwegian border and **[Moscow's strikingly
relaxed]{.mark}** reaction to **[Finnish NATO
membership]{.mark}**]{.underline} in spring 2023. [The [Kremlin]{.mark}
obviously [recognizes]{.mark} that **[NATO poses no threat to
Russia]{.mark}**, he observed, "[otherwise they would]{.mark} have
[responded]{.mark} completely [differently]{.mark} to the accession of
Finland."]{.underline}

Bauer's comments [highlight the inconsistency of **[Russia's]{.mark}**
apparent [**indifference** to]{.mark} last year's decision by **[Finland
and Sweden]{.mark}** to abandon decades of neutrality and **[join
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [**Moscow** made **no effort** **to oppose
or deter** the NATO **bids**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the two Nordic
nations]{.underline}, despite the fact that [Finnish membership more
than doubled Russia's land border with the alliance]{.underline}, while
[impending Swedish membership will transform the Baltic Sea into a NATO
lake.]{.underline}

In the [eleven months leading up Finland's]{.underline} April 2023
[accession]{.underline}, there were [[**no** disinfo]{.mark}rmation
campaigns, [cyber attacks, political assassinations, airspace
intrusions, diplomatic threats]{.mark}, or any of the other **hybrid
warfare** tactics Russia is accused of using elsewhere in recent
years]{.underline}. **[[Nor]{.underline}]{.mark}** were there
[any]{.underline} menacing **[[military
build-ups]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On the contrary, Russia downplayed the
entire issue and actually pulled the vast majority of its troops and
military hardware away from the region. In August 2023, Finnish Foreign
Minister Elina Valtonen confirmed that [the **[border]{.mark}** area was
"**[pretty empty]{.mark}**" of Russian troops. "If we were a threat,
they would **certainly** not have **moved** their **troops
away**]{.underline}, even in a situation where they are engaged
somewhere else," she commented.

Russia's Vulnerabilities

[[Russia's **vulnerabilities** in a **Nordic crisis**
are]{.underline}]{.mark} to a large extent the same as its
vulnerabilities in other regions, though there are some aspects
[**[particular]{.mark} to this region**.]{.underline} [The Russian
[military has relatively **few forces** in northwestern Russia]{.mark}
because its main focus in recent years has been on securing the
Caucasus]{.underline}, reinforcing its border with Ukraine, [and
building up forces in]{.underline} the Arctic and [the Far
North.]{.underline} [Russian [forces]{.mark} in northwestern Russia [are
**not equipped** for a short-notice conventional
conflict]{.mark},]{.underline} [with relatively [**few mechanized
units** and a command structure **not set up to fight a war**]{.mark}
**in this
region**.]{.underline}[^14^](https://www.marshallcenter.org/node/1187#C14) As
noted above, [the **[geography]{.mark}** of the region [makes a
**maritime conflict**]{.mark} relatively **[complicated]{.mark} for
Russia**,]{.underline} though that disadvantage may be mitigated in a
broader engagement due to the Nordic region's proximity to Russia and
the relatively long border with Finland.

[[Russia is **hampered** by]{.mark} its **[lack of allies]{.mark}** in
the European theater.]{.underline} Although [Belarus]{.underline} is a
member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and a
Russian military partner, it would be unlikely to actively participate
in a Russian military campaign. It might, however, reluctantly allow
Russia to use its territory as a staging area in a conflict with NATO.
Recent political tensions about the extent to which Belarus can be
expected to integrate with Russia have highlighted the limits of the
relationship between Moscow and Minsk. [Other allies are even **less
likely to get involved**.]{.underline} [[Neither]{.mark} Russia's other
[CSTO allies nor China will want to get involved in a fight with
**NATO**]{.mark} and]{.underline} (with the exception of China) [would
not be able to **contribute significantly** to the effort.]{.underline}

As with any conflict with a powerful but distant adversary, [Russian
[leaders would be **concerned**]{.mark} that the **overall force
balance** between **Russia** and **NATO** would become highly
**unfavorable** [in a longer-term conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
this reason, [[they]{.mark} would [want to keep the conflict
**short**]{.mark} and [ensure]{.mark} that any [conflict]{.mark} in the
region [**would not** result in **horizontal
escalation**]{.mark},]{.underline} [[which could **expose** Russian
**territory**]{.mark} to defeat by the **much larger** and stronger
**U.S. military** in a regional or even global conflict.]{.underline}
[They would be [**particularly concerned** about]{.mark} the possibility
that the [conflict]{.mark} could [spread to **other theaters**]{.mark},
especially the Mediterranean, which would cause Russia's forces to be
**stretched thin** in a **fight on multiple fronts**.]{.underline}

Finally, [Russian leaders may be concerned about the impact of any kind
of extended or costly intervention on Russian domestic
politics.]{.underline} They will want to make sure that they avoid
costly and long-lasting entanglements that might result in the Russian
public turning against the intervention. Such a situation would be
especially likely if Western states pursued strong economic
countermeasures that had a direct negative effect on the Russian economy
or on Russians' ability to travel to Europe. In particular, this
scenario would be a problem in a conflict that the Russian public might
see as a war of choice rather than of necessity, especially one that
becomes costly in either financial or human terms. For this reason,
[[Russian leaders]{.mark} will **[seek to avoid]{.mark}** both
**defeat** and **long-term [entanglement]{.mark}** [in a **Nordic
conflict**]{.mark},]{.underline} [as these [circumstances would increase
the likelihood of a strong **negative effect** at the **domestic
level**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Red Sea War

### AT: RSW\-\--Houthi Threat Fake\-\--1NC

#### Houthis aren't a threat

The **Economist 25**, The Economist is a very reputable newspaper
regarding geopolitics and (of course) economics, 7/17/25, "As the
Houthis sink two ships in one week, the world shrugs,"
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2025/07/17/as-the-houthis-sink-two-ships-in-one-week-the-world-shrugs,
Troh

IT WAS a short-lived surrender. [[Earlier this year America carried out
more than 1,000 strikes against the Houthis]{.underline}]{.mark}, an
Iranian-backed militia in Yemen. The group had kept up a year-long
series of attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, ostensibly to
protest against Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. American bombing was meant
to dissuade them from future mayhem. When Donald Trump unexpectedly
announced a ceasefire on May 6th, he said the Houthis had agreed to just
that: "[[They have capitulated," the president said. "They say they will
not be blowing up ships anymore."]{.underline}]{.mark}

Exactly two months later, they blew up a ship. On July 6th Houthi gunmen
boarded the *Magic Seas*, a bulk carrier, and rigged it with explosives
(see map). The next day they attacked another vessel, the *Eternity C*,
with naval drones and rocket-propelled grenades. It sank on July 9th.
Nine of its 25 sailors are dead or missing. Six others were probably
kidnapped by the Houthis.

[[The group sank just two ships in all of 2024, and none since last
June. Now **they have sunk two in less than a week. Yet the world's
reaction has largely been to shrug**---a sign of how much the Houthis
have already roiled global shipping, and how difficult it is to stop
them by force.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The timing of these latest attacks was not random. The ceasefire gave
the Houthis two months to regroup. They largely sat on the sidelines
during last month's war between Israel and Iran. With that conflict
over, America is pruning its forces in the region: it has already
withdrawn several guided-missile destroyers, which helped to shield
commercial ships.

This was an opportune moment for the Houthis to remind everyone that
they can still menace the Red Sea. A show of solidarity with
Palestinians in Gaza remains a useful distraction from Yemen's own
problems---even though targeted ships often have only a tenuous
connection to Israel.

Neither the *Magic Seas* nor the *Eternity C* had made a recent stop
there. The former was hauling fertiliser and steel from China to Turkey;
the latter had just finished a humanitarian delivery for the World Food
Programme in Somalia. But their owners (two Greek firms) operate other
ships that continue to call at Israeli ports. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the
group's leader, said in a televised speech that more such attacks were
coming.

That will scare off the Western firms that had begun to contemplate a
return to the Red Sea. A total of 244 commercial ships passed through
the waterway between July 7th and July 13th. That is up slightly from
232 the week before, according to *Lloyd's List*, a shipping journal.
But it is around 50% lower than an average week in the summer of 2023,
before the Houthis started their attacks.

[**[America has not done much, beyond a few chiding
statements]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Officials in the region believe [[Mr
Trump is unlikely to order more attacks on the
Houthis]{.underline}]{.mark} unless they fire at American vessels, and
there are not many of those about. Israel has kept up occasional air
strikes on Yemen, but they are too sporadic to have much effect.

Both countries are learning what Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates did a decade ago: [**[the Houthis are hard to
uproot]{.mark}**.]{.underline} American strikes destroyed some of their
arsenal, but they still have ample smuggling routes from Iran, which
delivers either by sea or overland through Oman.

On July 16th the National Resistance Forces, a coalition of anti-Houthi
militias, announced that they had seized 750 tonnes of arms bound for
the group. It was an impressive effort---but also a reminder of how much
slips through unnoticed. As long as the Houthis have a stockpile of
weapons and the will to use them, they can continue to cause chaos in
the Red Sea.

terrorism,]{.underline} using historical data to provide a solid basis.
[Three essential components of the model are integrated: an analysis of

[[Risk is a]{.mark} fundamental, but **[subjective concept]{.mark}**
influenced by social constructs, cognitive biases, and affective
heuristics]{.underline} (Breckenridge et al., Citation2010; Finucane et
al., Citation2000; Slovic, Citation1987, Citation1997). [[Exact
risk]{.mark} **[can never be known]{.mark}**]{.underline} (it is
inherently uncertain), but formal risk estimates (FREs), which are the
systematically and rationally quantified risk estimates made by risk
analysts, are considered the most accurate means to estimate a hazard's
risk (Douglas, Citation1994; Fischhoff et al., Citation1983; Plattner et
al., Citation2006; Slovic, Citation1987[). However, when people form
their perceptions of risk for various hazards, several processes
interlope, resulting in biases. This is likely why [risk perceptions for
terrorism are **so overblown**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Risk]{.underline}, as it exists in the minds of the vast majority of
people the vast majority of the time[, is inextricable from **social
constructions** of hazards]{.underline} (Douglas, Citation1994; Joffe,
Citation2003), attitudes toward hazards (Sjöberg, Citation2000a,
Citation2000b), and the biases, including those of emotion, inherent in
human processing (Slovic, Citation1987). [Research has clearly
demonstrated that people's [approximations of risk are **not accurately
calculated**]{.mark} and are not based on rational models]{.underline}
(Kahneman et al., Citation1982; Slovic, Citation1987). In fact, [people
tend not to trust FREs, since they are calculated so differently from
lay risk perceptions]{.underline} (Slovic, Citation1993). For example,
[research demonstrates that risk **[perceptions are socially
constructed]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Slovic, Citation1997; Slovic et al.,
Citation2004[). In other words, one's worldview and social
representations create meaning for hazards, which influence the risk
perception for that hazard]{.underline} (Slovic, Citation1997). In the
case of terrorism, one of the most culturally meaningful, pervasive, and
mentally available (see Lichtenstein et al., Citation1978; Tversky &
Kahneman, Citation1974) hazards in US society, [this results in inflated
risk perceptions for terrorism despite its FRE being objectively very
low]{.underline} (Alhakami & Slovic, Citation1994; Breckenridge et al.,
Citation2010; Fischhoff et al., Citation1978; Gigerenzer, Citation2004;
Lerner et al., Citation2003; Lichtenstein et al., Citation1978).

In addition, [risk [perceptions for terrorism are]{.mark} likely to be
**[particularly overestimated]{.mark}** because [terrorism is an]{.mark}
archetypal example of]{.underline} what Slovic (Citation1987) has termed
[a 'dread risk,' meaning that its **[extreme rarity]{.mark}** and
severity are more likely to elicit strong emotions such as
fear]{.underline} (Lerner et al., Citation2003) [and dread]{.underline}
(Fischhoff et al., Citation1978; Gigerenzer, Citation2004) than [more
common hazards, like heart disease or car accidents]{.underline}
(Lichtenstein et al., Citation1978; Slovic, Citation2000; Slovic &
Peters, Citation2006). Sunstein (Citation2003) extends this further,
[suggesting that [biases]{.mark} in risk perception [for
terrorism]{.mark} [stem from]{.mark} what he refers to as
**[probability]{.mark} [neglect]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This occurs when
a hazard's consequences are so harmful and horrifying that [[people
focus only on]{.mark} how much [harm]{.mark} the event would cause if it
happened [and neglect]{.mark} to think about [how **very unlikely it
is** that]{.mark} [it will happen]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While some research has measured risk perceptions for terrorism (RPT)
directly (Koivula et al., Citation2021; Lee et al., Citation2010; Liu et
al., Citation2019), most studies of how people respond to terrorism have
measured fear of terrorism or worry about terrorism (for a review, see
Sinclair & Antonius, Citation2012), while others have asked participants
to estimate how frequently past terrorist attacks have occurred (Kearns
et al., Citation2019). However, [[it is **ill-advised**]{.mark} [to
measure]{.mark} [risk]{.mark} perception [using]{.mark} appraisals of a
hazard's [past frequency]{.mark}, as risk is defined as the perceived
probability of experiencing future harm or loss from a
hazard]{.underline} (Joffe, Citation2003; Renn, Citation1998; Sjöberg,
Citation2000a; Slovic, Citation2000). In addition, [fear, anxiety, and
[worry]{.mark} about terrorism [should not be considered]{.mark}
[measures of risk]{.mark} perception, as these are very different
constructs from risk perception and are more likely to be byproducts of
risk perception for terrorism rather than approximations of
it]{.underline} (Sjöberg, Citation1998). Risk perceptions are cognitive:
they are assessments of probability. [[Fear]{.mark}, anxiety,
[and]{.mark} [worry]{.mark} [about terrorism]{.mark}, on the other hand,
**[are conceptualized]{.mark}** in the literature [as emotional
responses]{.mark}, whereas risk perceptions are the product of
information processing]{.underline} (which is not to say they are not
influenced by emotions, but they are not emotions themselves; Fischoff
et al., 1978; Lerner et al., Citation2003; Slovic, Citation2000).

For instance, on his arrival at the White House, President Joe Biden
stressed the importance of fighting climate change, but also of reducing
U.S. dependence on at-risk countries and regions in key sectors. In the
high-quality semiconductor sector, for example, the Biden administration
stressed that Taiwan's pre-eminence could represent a national security
threat should China one day decide to launch a military intervention of
the island or initiate an economic blockade in the region. Biden further
believed that the green revolution he proposed would depend too much on
Chinese imports (e.g., rare earths and critical minerals, battery
components for electric vehicles, etc.).

IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING the dramatic Oval Office meeting between Ukrainian

efforts to]{.mark} **[anchor US involvement]{.mark}** and strengthen the
unity of the Group of Seven as a whole]{.underline}" (quoted in Nikkei
Shimbun 2025a). The idea he evoked, tsunagitomeru---which translates to
"[tying down," "hitching," or "anchoring"]{.underline} in

[[Despite]{.mark} a series of clearly [disruptive messages]{.mark}
[emanating from]{.mark} the second [Trump]{.mark}
administration---]{.underline}ranging from its rough approach to the war
in Ukraine to aggressive tariff measures, public confrontations with

Overall, [[the return of Trump signals **four difficult years**
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark} for China. The author argues that
[tensions]{.underline} in Sino--US relations [are long-standing and
constitute a structural issue]{.underline}. As an important US ally,
Japan has also aligned itself with the United States in taking a tougher
stance towards China, although [[Japan]{.mark} clearly still
[maintains]{.mark} a degree of **[autonomy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The China policies of the new US and Japanese administrations differ
significantly. The United States, as a "chimera" of MAGA and traditional
"peace through strength", will take a more hard-line approach, leading
to further stagnation in Sino--US relations, which are of the utmost
importance to China. However, the structural nature of the Sino--US
conflict implies that this situation is not unprecedented. Despite the
[**[high]{.mark} [level of uncertainty]{.mark}** [associated
with]{.mark} the second [Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline},
there will likely be a certain degree of continuity with the Biden
administration's China policy. On the other hand, [[Japan's]{.mark}
Ishiba administration has [demonstrated a]{.mark} [willingness to remain
**engaged with China**]{.mark} to manage risks]{.underline}.

China, for its part, is well-prepared for the return of Trump. While
working to stabilise relations with the United States, China is also
seeking to improve relations omnidirectionally. [[China will deepen
**cooperation with Russia**]{.mark}, emerging economies [and the]{.mark}
[Global South]{.mark}. [It will]{.mark} also strive to [improve
relations with]{.mark}]{.underline} Western countries, including
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}. In particular, the Ishiba administration
presents an opportunity for China, and it will be important to maintain
dialogue and exchanges in order to resolve as many difficult issues as
possible.

## Arctic War

#### The Arctic is a unique site for cooperation -- recent militarization and deployments don't undermine stability.

Since February 2022, there have been interpretations and [speculations
of an [increase of militarization]{.mark}]{.underline} and emerging
confrontation [in the Arctic. [Yet]{.mark}, there are **[no armed
conflicts]{.mark}** or warfare in the region]{.underline}, unlike the
hot wars and constant warfare in the Middle East, Africa, Southern Asia
and Europe. Instead, the [[Arctic]{.mark} Region seems to be in a [state
of]{.mark} **[constant (peace]{.mark}ful)** transformation]{.underline}
that affects the region and the entire Earth mostly by more constructive
ways, [despite the deployed heavy nuclear weapon systems of]{.underline}
the [Russian]{.underline} Federation [and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

The first significant transformation of the Arctic led from the military
tensions of the Cold War to geopolitical stability based on cooperation
across borders. This would not have been possible without the growing
concern among Indigenous Peoples, non-governmental organisations, civil
society, and scholars and scientists over the state of the region's
ecosystems. This concern led to the establishment of cooperative
structures on environmental protection among the Arctic States and
Indigenous Peoples, in particular the Arctic Environmental Protection
Strategy and the Arctic Council. This also caused a shift in their
security premises towards a more comprehensive understanding of
security.

Experience has shown that functional cooperation in the field(s) of low
politics is an efficient way of rebuilding confidence between former
rivals. In terms of the circumpolar North, the most vivid example is
cooperation on environmental protection due to long-range air and water
pollution, which became a shared interest and stabilising factor in the
region's geopolitics and security. As a result, the eight [[Arctic
States]{.mark},]{.underline} supported by Indigenous Peoples
Organisations and local communities, reconstructed their geopolitical
reality [[commit]{.mark}ting "[to **maintain peace, stability**
and]{.mark} constructive [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}", as stated
by Arctic Council declarations.

When analysing the transformation and reconstruction that has taken
place in the northernmost regions within the last 35 years or so, the
main conclusion is twofold: Firstly, [trans-boundary cooperation
[indicates]{.mark} the presence of **[shared]{.mark}**/common
**[interests]{.mark}** among the Arctic States]{.underline}, and between
them and Arctic Indigenous Peoples, for example on environmental
protection, search and rescue, scientific cooperation, and economic
activities. Secondly, certain specific features of Arctic geopolitics,
security and governance---for example, the original nature of Arctic
military for global deterrence, [the [lack of]{.mark} armed
[conflicts]{.mark} [and]{.mark} serious [disputes of]{.mark} state
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}, the high degree of international
legal certainty, and self-governance---[[made it]{.mark} [uniquely
possible]{.mark} to form suitable conditions [for **resilient
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [enabled an increase in
geopolitical stability]{.underline} and supported regional development.

[Recognised as a distinctive, cooperative region, the Arctic became
globalised]{.underline} by major environmental challenges, in particular
rapid climate change and global economic interests such as the
mass-scale utilisation of hydrocarbons. [[After Russia]{.mark} [invaded
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in February 2022, the Arctic started to
reflect the patterns of great-power rivalries and new East-West tension,
as the temporary pause of the Arctic Council and its working groups
indicates.

My latest research, published as the Geneva Paper 35/2024, shows that
[[most]{.mark} of the common interests and special [features of Arctic
geopolitics are **still in place**]{.mark}]{.underline} or can easily be
revived, given the necessary political will. A sustainable solution to
the climate crisis---worldwide and in the Arctic---is based on
interdependence. The [[common interests]{.mark} in the Arctic
[reveal]{.mark} such an **[interdependent nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}
of the region, made possible by its special geopolitical features.
[Cross-border cooperation in the Arctic is a practical and doable
means]{.underline}, as has been shown, even manifested, in the first
decades of the post-Cold War Arctic.

Ultimately, while seven ([[NATO-aligned) Arctic
States]{.underline}]{.mark} might share the thinking that Russia is no
longer a reliable partner, they nevertheless [still [share with
Russia]{.mark} the [undeniable knowledge that]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[benefits of cooperation]{.mark} and stability [are]{.mark} much
[greater than]{.mark} those of [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} and
confrontation with high prices. Yet, despite all the speculations and
threat pictures, the [entire North is still **free of armed conflicts**,
warfare and uprisings,]{.underline} unlike many other parts of the
world. [It has also been possible to maintain joint activities of Arctic
Council Working Group]{.underline}s. Furthermore, there is a great deal
more to gain for all parties, in particular for the peoples and
communities of the region, if we were to go back to a situation where
cooperation is a key part of the Arctic States' foreign, security and
climate policies.

The conclusions of the Geneva paper reveal that [there are [**no real
obstacles** to]{.mark} the [Arctic States rediscovering]{.mark} the
[huge benefits of cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}---except a
potentially catastrophic lack of the necessary political will to do so.
To avoid or minimise this danger, more research and analysis needs to be
done on the dynamics and benefits of shared interests, as well as on
cooperation as the main factor of international relations. We need to
move away from focusing research purely on the description of challenges
and speculation about potential threats. Finally, it would be logical
and sensible, at this stage, to [recognize the shared interests and
special features as constructive aspects and ingredients of Arctic
geopolitics and governance.]{.underline} We need to analyse the
processes, as well as rethink, discuss and debate how to reaffirm
commitments to maintain peace and stability.

#### No Aleutians war -- Shemya Island checks RC probing

Angels in Alaska in response to Russian and Chinese maneuvers in the

[[The United States is responding to increased military activity by
Russia and China in the Arctic by strengthening its military presence in
the region]{.underline}]{.mark}. A portion of [[the 11th Airborne
Division]{.underline},]{.mark} nicknamed the \"Arctic Angels,\" [[has
arrived on Shemya Island]{.underline}]{.mark}, Alaska, [[along with
other support, including heavy equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
troops were deployed as part of a force protection operation at a time
when the area around the North Pole is becoming an increasingly
competitive space, partly due to climate change.

The Arctic Angels were first activated by the U.S. Army during World War
II. The 11th Airborne Division\'s first deployment was in June 1944 in
the Philippines, and after the war ended, the unit became part of the
military administration in Japan. Part of the division also managed a
mission during the Korean War before it was fully inactivated in 1958.
Its rebirth came two years ago with the merger of two brigade combat
teams in Alaska. Now, [[its deployments are extending deeper into the
field in response to geopolitical developments.]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"As the number of hostile exercises around Alaska and throughout the
region increases, including the joint Russian-Chinese bomber patrol in
June, **[[the Shemya Island operation demonstrates the division\'s
ability to respond to events in the Indo-Pacific or around the world
with swift and lethal force in a matter of
hours]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" said Maj. Gen. Joseph Hilbert, commander
of the 11th Airborne Division, in a U.S. Army statement. His
subordinates will operate in the Aleutian Islands along with the 1st and
3rd Divisions of the multi-agency group, having moved from
Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage and Fort Wainwright in Fairbanks.

The U.S. military\'s response is driven by maneuvers, various exercises,
and reconnaissance actions by Russia and China, which have recently
become easier and more frequent in the area due to climate change and
melting ice sheets. The group is also assigned to the U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command, a priority area for the Department of Defense, covering more
than half of the world\'s population. \"Testing ourselves in this
operation, and others like it, is critical to defending our nation and
preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Major General Hilbert
continued in his remarks, adding, \"Our ability to rapidly and
effectively deploy combat-capable forces to any location, no matter how
remote, is essential to supporting the nation and our strong
relationships with allies and partner nations.\"

The soldiers also brought two HIMARS missile systems and AN/TPQ-53 radar
systems to their new location. In western Alaska, the Army deployed a
guided-missile destroyer and a Coast Guard vessel in early September in
response to the Russian-Chinese Ocean-24 exercise in the Pacific and
Arctic. At the time, [[Russian military aircraft were repeatedly
intercepted in the area, even four days in a row and in
pairs]{.underline}]{.mark}. The planes operated in the Alaska
Identification Zone, which, while not within sovereign U.S. airspace, is
an area where U.S. authorities expect planes to identify themselves.
There have been 25 such overflights this year, compared to just one more
overflight in the entirety of last year. Previously, Washington
registered up to ten such interceptions a year.

From the moment Donald Trump was elected US President, Russia and its
allies began to assert that Washington was more interested in peace than
Moscow because "Russia was winning." [But the [Kremlin's
position]{.mark} is [not as strong]{.mark} as it [likes to
pretend]{.mark}; economists say [the economy is **struggling**]{.mark}
and will have [serious difficulties meeting rising military
expenditure]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [main threats]{.mark} are the [falling price of oil]{.mark} and
[tightening sanctions]{.mark} on Russia's [energy exports]{.mark}, which
will [result in its revenues being driven even
lower]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [Russian economy]{.mark} is
**[stagnating]{.mark}**, while the [civilian sector]{.mark} is [close to
**recession**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Higher tax rates may not have the
anticipated effect of bringing in extra revenue since the tax base also
shrinks as the economy contracts.

Against this background, [it [will be problematic for Moscow to increase
military spending]{.mark} to the levels it will need [to sustain]{.mark}
the [war]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the first years after the full-scale
invasion, [[Russia benefited from weapons reserves]{.mark} that had been
preserved since Soviet times, [but these]{.mark} too [have been
**depleted**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} 

Last year, military [[analysts noted a reduction in stocks]{.mark} not
only of [armored vehicles]{.mark} but also of multiple [launch rocket
systems]{.mark} like Grad, Uragan, and Smerch]{.underline}. Aware of
this, is trying to increase production, but analysis by Radio

continue, this would permit increased military spending, but sectors not
related to military production would suffer from a reduction in
government demand, with citizens facing stagnation or a fall in real
incomes.

almost **400bn rubles [(\$5bn) seized]{.mark}** [from corrupt

The Prosecutor General's office had reported the seizure of 504bn rubles
in corrupt assets and property, but only 114bn appeared in the budget.
"The fight against corruption only breeds new corruption," the TV

Pro-Kremlin commentators have tried to offer reassurance about the
economic position. The [business
newsletter Vzglyad](https://vz.ru/economy/2025/5/10/1330913.html), for
example, said India's increased purchases of oil from the US instead of
Russia were not bad for Moscow, as India will need Russian oil to refine
the American fuel. It argued that Europe was threatened with dependence
on American oil in the event of a refusal to buy from Russia, and argued
that the growth of OPEC+ oil production and fall in prices are [in
Moscow's interests](https://vz.ru/economy/2025/5/7/1330658.html). 

Pro-Kremlin economists also hope that, with American mediation, Russia
will share the European gas market with the US and resume supplies to
European countries. Another hope is that Serbia and Hungary will form
a ["new
Austro-Hungary,"](https://vz.ru/opinions/2025/4/10/1324805.html) which
would be completely "tied to Russian oil"  and soon joined by Austria
and Slovakia in a pro-Russian alliance. 

While the new Austro-Hungarian Empire exists only in a world of dreams,
such Putin-supporting commentators and propagandists have been forced to
look for more realistic ways of coping with Russia's difficulties. Some
have
even [proposed](https://topwar.ru/263943-objazatelnoe-raspredelenie-vypusknikov-vuzov-novyj-vyzov-sovremennosti.html) the
compulsory distribution of university graduates to companies, as was the
case in Soviet times.

But the authorities will strive to avoid such unpopular measures, and
one way of doing so would be to engineer a pause in the war or a

Less than a week ahead of next week\'s referendum on the future of the

Peninsula, taking over a military hospital in Simferopol, a military
base in Sevastopol, and a naval supply base in Chornomorskoye.

[Over the weekend, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates told \"Fox News

\"I don\'t think that he wants to recreate the Soviet Union precisely

[Ukraine's economy is very small and, as a result, trade with it doesn't
matter to Western countries]{.underline}. This also means that, unlike
China or Russia for European countries, there are [[few groups in the
West]{.mark} that [have an **economic stake** in]{.mark} [Ukraine's
independence]{.mark}]{.underline} and will lobby government officials to
provide more economic and military assistance.4 Once again, I don't
think the West is going to stop supporting Ukraine anytime soon, but I
also think that it will continue to do so in a half-hearted way and to
drag its feet when it comes to providing more assistance. Hawks are
right when they say that, for instance, the West could do more to help
Ukraine by implementing harsher sanctions against Russia. For instance,
we could in theory do more to prevent Russia from selling oil and gas on
the international market, but this would increase the price of energy
and harm us a lot. We could also do more to prevent the circumvention of
export control on dual-use Western components to Russia, but this would
impose a cost on Western companies to track their supply chains and
would force us to sanction more non-Western companies in emerging
markets, which in turn would create political tensions with those
countries and harm Western companies. There are limits to how far
Western officials are prepared to go in that direction. This is not
because they're evil or particularly short-sighted --- that's just how
politics works. t's foolish to expect that Western politicians can
divert a lot of resources to help Ukraine defeat Russia if they don't
have the support of many powerful groups pushing for a stronger
commitment to Ukraine's defence.

Similarly, [while public opinion]{.underline} in the West [has become
very hostile to Russia and is largely sympathetic to Ukraine, the truth
is that [most people **don't really care** about Ukraine]{.mark}. A lot
of very bad things also happen in the rest of the world]{.underline},
which the West could also prevent in theory (in many cases it would
actually be much easier than helping Ukraine defeat Russia), [but people
mostly don't really care about them]{.underline} either. A terrible
civil war has been raging in Sudan since last year, Azerbaijan carried
out ethnic cleansing in Nagorno-Karabakh and now threatens to attack
Armenia, Israel is turning Gaza into a pile of ruble and allowing
settlers to run amok terrorising Palestinians in the West Bank, various
conflicts that have resulted in the death of a very large number of
people have been raging in some parts of the Democratic Republic of
Congo for more than 20 years, etc. and people in the West mostly don't
care, despite the fact that in some cases Western governments are more
or less directly assisting people committing war crimes in those
conflicts. Again, that's not because they're evil or stupid, [it's just
normal for people not to care very much about what happens in foreign
countries.]{.underline} They have a normal job to do and the rest of the
time they want to be with their family or just enjoy their life without
thinking about what's happening on the other side of the world if that's
not directly and meaningfully impacting them. You can argue that people
should care more, but they don't, so it makes no difference to my point
even if you're right.

Of course, [[if the rhetoric]{.mark} to the effect [that what is at
stake in Ukraine is the fate of democracy]{.mark} everywhere [or]{.mark}
that]{.underline} unless Ukraine defeats [[Russia]{.mark} it [will
attack NATO]{.mark}'s eastern flank [next **were true**, it would
be]{.mark} a [different]{.mark} story.]{.underline} The Cold War was
very expensive, but the US and its allies still fought it and allocated
huge amounts of resources to do so because they really believed that the
Soviet Union might invade Western Europe. It's true, based on what we
have learned since the collapse of the Soviet Union with the partial
declassification of Soviet archives and testimonies by former Soviet
officials, that [[Western fears of]{.mark} a [Soviet invasion]{.mark}
[were **exaggerated**]{.mark},]{.underline} but Western officials really
believed that was a serious possibility all the same. [It's quite clear
that, despite their rhetoric, Western [officials]{.mark} are [**not
overly concerned** about]{.mark} the possibility that [Russia]{.mark}
might [attack]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark}'s eastern flank]{.underline} in
Poland or the Baltics and, as I have argued previously, [they have every
reason not to be]{.underline}.5 It's striking that, [[in the debate
about Russia and Ukraine]{.mark}, the prevailing [discourse]{.mark}
manages to both [under]{.mark}estimate [and]{.mark} [overestimate
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} They overestimate it by talking as if
[[Russian leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} could be so disconnected from
reality as to not [[realise]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} would [have
**no chance**]{.mark} in a war [against NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and
underestimate it by assuming that because [[NATO is]{.mark} so **[much
more powerful]{.mark}** than Russia it can win a proxy war in Ukraine
against it.]{.underline}

### AT: Ukraine\-\--No Impact\-\--2NC

#### Threats are exaggerated, and worst case scenarios are capped at conventional warfare

**Lemoine 24** \[Philippe Lemoine, Research Fellow at the Center for the
Study of Partisanship and Ideology, \"Why Ukraine almost certainly

https://thecritic.co.uk/why-ukraine-almost-certainly-cannot-win/\] erin

In sum, Russia is on track to command the largest military on the
continent and a defense industrial complex capable of generating
substantial amounts of ammunition and materiel in support of large scale
combat operations. [**Regardless of the outcome** of the war in Ukraine,
Russia will be larger, more lethal, and angrier with the West than when
it invaded.]{.underline}

In other words, not only is Western military assistance to Ukraine
failing to achieve its objective, but as I previously warned it might,
it will probably bring about the very kind of situation it was supposed
to prevent. It's true that, because it's going to be forced to fight a
long war of attrition, Russia is going to burn through most of its
Soviet-era stockpiles of equipment, but what good will that do us? The
vast majority of that equipment was in no condition to be used without
significant and costly refurbishment that Russia showed absolutely no
inclination to perform until it had to. It would probably have become
totally unsalvageable or useless within a few decades and it's not as if
Russia was going to use it against NATO if we hadn't supported Ukraine
anyway. Indeed, even [[if Russia had]{.mark} somehow [been **crazy
enough** to attack]{.mark} a [NATO]{.mark} member next, it's very
unlikely that it would have turned into a war of attrition]{.underline}
in which Russia has to dig into its stockpiles [because the [fear
of]{.mark} a [nuclear escalation would]{.mark} almost certainly [have
ended the fighting]{.mark} long before that.]{.underline} What matters
for Europe's security is not how much equipment Russia has in
stockpiles, it's the capabilities it can actually mobilise on a
relatively short notice, which is very different.

I think [[Cavoli]{.mark} likely [**exaggerates the threat** that Russia
will pose after the war is over]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is not
surprising because it's in the [[Pentagon's interest]{.mark} to inflate
threats in order [to secure a larger budget]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still,
there is little doubt that, if you take into account both capabilities
and intentions, Russia will pose a greater threat to Europe after the
war than before and more importantly for the debate about Western policy
toward Ukraine it will pose a greater threat than it would have if the
West had not forced Russia to fight a prolonged war of attrition by
providing military assistance to Ukraine. Had this not happened, Ukraine
would have run out of ammunition sometime in 2022 and the conventional
phase of the war, if not the war itself, would have ended a few months
after the beginning of the invasion. I'm sure people will argue that,
had this happened, people would have launched a massive program of
military spending to reconstitute its forces anyway, but there is no
evidence whatsoever for that view and plenty of evidence that it
wouldn't have. Indeed, not only did Putin fail to mobilise despite the
failure of Russia's initial assault in 2022 until the successful
Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv in the fall, but even after that
counteroffensive Russia still planned to wind defence spending down
after 2023, presumably because it was over-optimistic about the
prospects of ending the war quickly.

In response to the greater threat posed by Russia, European countries
will increase their defence spending because [even though a Russian
attack on NATO is **very unlikely** people will be scared of it and
governments have to prepare even for unlikely possibilities]{.underline}
(though military budgets won't increase as much as people are predicting
because [European [officials don't]{.mark} really [believe]{.mark} their
[apocalyptic rhetoric about the consequences a Ukrainian defeat]{.mark}
would have]{.underline} and most European governments are going to face
severe budget deficits in the coming years as a result of expenditures
they made to deal with the pandemic and the energy crisis). Thus, the
main result of the war, from a strategic point of view, is going to be a
new equilibrium in which both Russia and the West spend more on defence
(which in turn means that over the next few decades trillions of dollars
will be diverted from more productive uses to finance military
spending), without a fundamental alteration of the balance of power in
Europe. [While it's going to be a tragedy for Ukraine, [this won't be
the **end of the world**]{.mark}]{.underline} for the rest of Europe and
most of the [people who at the moment are claiming that unless Russia is
defeated in Ukraine all hell is going to break loose will have forgotten
about it only a few month after]{.underline} it's over if not before.
But it will still be very costly and it's only because [the [West is so
rich and]{.mark} [powerful]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} likely **[won't
feel]{.mark} very [much pain]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[issues]{.mark} [are temporary]{.mark}]{.underline}---and [when it comes

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

When Ford completed its massive River Rouge plant in 1928, it created a
factory that controlled every facet of car production, including its own
steel mill. Trade volume was high during this era, but very few
intermediate goods crossed borders. In the time since then, the
industrial organization of production has changed a wee bit. Whereas
trade a century ago was primarily in finished goods, manufacturing now
has disaggregated itself into myriad chains of subcontractors. As one
MIT Sloan Management Review article summarized the phenomenon, we have a
\"deeper tiering of supply chains whereby suppliers draw upon their
suppliers who in turn draw on their own networks of suppliers in
multistage production networks.\" Why did this happen? The end of the
Cold War eliminated most geopolitical concerns about where to locate
production facilities. Basic trade theory meant an awful lot of
facilities expanded in China, the low-cost manufacturing locale. The
reduction of transportation and communication costs made it easier for
production to be disaggregated and managed at a distance.
\"Just-in-time\" manufacturing encouraged companies to hold minimal
inventories and count on suppliers to respond quickly to fluctuations in
consumer demand. Management consultants stressed the efficiency of
offshore outsourcing. The most widely cited example of the globalized
supply chain is Apple\'s iPhone. Most people know that the iPhone is
manufactured in China and exported to the United States. What is less
well known is that China plays only a minor role in the creation of its
added value. The iPhone\'s flash drive comes from the Japanese firm
Toshiba. Samsung, a South Korean firm, provides the application
processor. A German company provides the camera module, and a U.S.
subcontractor provides the Bluetooth application. All of these parts are
then assembled by a Taiwanese firm, Foxconn, with operations in
Shenzhen, China. The management consultants were right about the
efficiency. While productivity in the service sector stagnated after the
turn of the century, manufacturing productivity continued to soar. The
political economy advantages were also apparent after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers. The last time a financial shock of that magnitude hit,
the trade wars of the Great Depression began. 2008 was different. A
World Bank study examined trade restrictions immediately after 2008 and
found that \"vertical specialization\" was the most powerful economic
factor that limited tariff increases. The more a country\'s economy was
enmeshed in global supply chains, the less likely it was to raise
barriers to trade. Global supply chains help explain why the Great
Recession did not lead to trade wars like those of the Great Depression.
So these global value chains seemed like an unalloyed good. And then the
2010s happened. As global supply chains grew more and more complex,
there were signs of trouble on the horizon. In 2011, the Chao Phraya
River floods in Thailand severely but temporarily constricted production
of hard disk drives, because close to half of global output was sourced
from Thailand. In 2017, U.S. hospitals faced an acute shortage of IV
bags after Hurricane Maria knocked out a key production facility in
Puerto Rico. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit Fukushima in Japan
affected key nodes in global manufacturing. Some firms suspended sales
of cars in certain colors because key ingredients were stored near
Fukushima and inaccessible. An iPhone designer warned The New York Times
that \"there are all kinds of little specialized parts without second
sources, like connectors, speakers, microphones, batteries and sensors
that don\'t get the love they deserve. Many are from Japan.\"

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

[These supply chain hiccups highlighted one underanticipated phenomenon
of globalization: Rather than strengthen market competition, it
strengthened market concentration]{.underline}. Consumer-facing firms
from Walmart to Ford to Apple to Home Depot stressed cost minimization
ubër alles. Firms that excelled at efficiently producing one part became
near-monopolists for that component. This is how Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC) became the dominant global supplier of
customized semiconductor chips. Other chipmakers focused on design,
subcontracting to the Taiwanese firm for the physical production. As
TSMC accrued comparative advantages in chip production, even established
competitors such as Intel struggled.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

The return of geopolitical competition has also flummoxed producers.
China is a critical node in almost every global value chain. Over the
last decade, as Xi Jinping has consolidated his power, the Chinese state
has taken a number of steps that have raised hackles in Western
capitals. Some of these, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, have been
overhyped. Others, such as the subjugation of the Uyghurs, repression in
Hong Kong, increasing control over United Nations agencies, and the
expansion of China\'s nuclear arsenal, have not. Xi\'s \"wolf warrior
diplomacy\" has triggered evaluations in the United States, Europe, and
Pacific Rim about just how vulnerable their economies are to disruptions
from Chinese suppliers. The 2010 rare earth embargo on Japan in response
to a territorial dispute in the East China Sea offered a warning about
how China could weaponize the interdependence of global value chains;
Huawei\'s dominance in 5G offered another. Erratic U.S. policies during
the Trump administration served in turn as a warning about how Western
governments could disrupt global value chains. Finally, the COVID-19
pandemic exacerbated the problems of both market concentration and
political whimsy. As China reeled from the pandemic\'s first wave, there
were disruptions across the global economy. China exercised state power
to seize domestically produced personal protective equipment and other
medical supplies; the United States soon reciprocated. According to
Global Trade Alert, 157 export controls on medical supplies and
medicines were put in place across 86 jurisdictions in the first six
months of the pandemic. U.S. leaders expressed concerns about
vulnerability to China weaponizing its role in medical supply chains. So
did journalists: In May 2021, 60 Minutes warned that \"COVID showed that
the global supply chain of chips is fragile.\" The Washington Post
concurred: \"The pandemic has exposed fragile global supply chains
across multiple continents.\" Countries exercised vaccine nationalism,
stunting global immunization against COVID-19, which in turn facilitated
the development of more dangerous variants of the novel coronavirus. The
delta variant has penetrated Chinese port facilities, Malaysian chip
factories, and Bangladeshi textile plants, leading to periodic shutdowns
that have spiked container shipping prices and lengthened order
backlogs. Throughout all this, producers seemed to be stuck in
quicksand. The past decade has not been shy in signaling to firms that
there might be risks to increasingly disaggregated global supply chains.
If natural disasters, pandemics, and geopolitical tensions were not
enough, now management consultants are piling on. The same consultants
who urged offshoring a generation ago are now telling firms to retrench
from globalized supply chains. But most firms do not seem terrifically
interested in changing their practices. Multinational corporations like
Apple have not altered their supply chains in response to political
pressure. Whether one looks at business surveys or journalistic
accounts, the results are the same: Most U.S. firms do not plan on
moving their supply chains away from China. A world in which the
distribution of goods is held up due to constant supply chain
disruptions seems less than ideal. What can be done about it? One thing
that would be great is if everyone would acknowledge that a lot of the
issues with global value chains right now have to do with demand more
than supply. When the pandemic began, there was an immediate and acute
contraction of demand. Producers assumed that this would be the new
normal and reduced their output. They were mistaken. The combination of
emergency COVID-19 relief and the work-from-home phenomenon led to a
resurgence of demand. The affluent class had considerable sums of
disposable income. The pandemic made spending on services a less viable
option, so instead they spent it on stuff: cars, furniture, home office
equipment, gaming systems, house renovations, and so forth. The shortage
of semiconductor chips was caused by the unexpected twin rebounds in
demand for cars and consumer electronics. As one Federal Reserve
analysis explained, \"the pause in demand was much shorter and the
rebound in demand was much stronger than anticipated.\" These demand
surges surprised suppliers and led to the production bottlenecks that
are currently seizing up Pottery Barn orders.

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

[While demand has been stronger than expected, [supply]{.mark} in
critical sectors [coped better than expected]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
[predicted]{.mark} pandemic [breakdowns in supply chains]{.mark} for
food and medical supplies [proved]{.mark} to be
**[overstated]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Surveys of logistical firms last
year revealed that the pandemic had [minimal effects on their
operational capabilities.]{.underline} Even when it came to medicines
and personal protective equipment, there were only minor disruptions
after the initial shock in March 2020. [[Claims that]{.mark} the [global
supply chain]{.mark} in medical products [rendered states vulnerable
to]{.mark} [weaponized interdependence proved]{.mark} to be **[wildly
exaggerated]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The pandemic affected service
sectors such as tourism far more severely than any manufacturing sector.
Indeed, Slate\'s Jordan Weissmann pointed out recently that \"imports
were up 5 percent year-over-year in September, and up 17 percent
compared with the same time in 2019.\" This happened despite the decline
in air passenger traffic, which restricted yet another means of shipping
goods by air. Supply has increased---it\'s just that demand has surged
even more.

[The [private sector is]{.mark} responding to market signals by ramping
up production and [ensuring multiple]{.mark} [supply
lines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Intel, Samsung, and TSMC are all spending
tens of billions of dollars to build new chip foundries in the United
States. Skyrocketing shipping prices are incentivizing additional
construction of new container ships. The Wall Street Journal reports
that in the first five months of 2021, there were nearly twice as many
orders for new container ships as there were in all of 2019 and 2020
combined. To ensure holiday inventory, large retailers like Walmart and
Home Depot have chartered their own container ships. Container shipping
rates have already started to decline from September peaks.

\<\<\<Condensed, None Omitted\>\>\>

But these capital investments designed to boost resilience will take
years to kick in. This time lag is one reason private-sector actors have
been so slow to invest in resilient supply chains in the past. If
disruptions are expected to be temporary, such investments might seem
like overreactions. Given the billions of dollars at stake, this sort of
risk aversion is unfortunate but understandable. Long-term investments
in resilience make some sense, but short-term investments in robustness
make even more sense. Resilience is the ability to adapt in response to
permanent shocks to the system. Robustness is the ability to maintain
output levels in response to a short-term hit. The most obvious way that
firms can enhance their robustness is to warehouse supplies of key
components. Car manufacturers, for example, are pledging to ramp up
their inventories of critical components to ensure a more reliable
production stream. Yet the auto sector appears to be the exception and
not the rule in bolstering inventories. For most firms, increasing
reserves of component parts is an expensive proposition. To a
corporation, holding inventory is like holding cash: Why sit on an asset
that yields no rate of return? Lean manufacturing was popular in the
first place because it boosted profits. Even as semiconductors have
grown scarce, chipmakers and chip customers have battled over which
firms will shoulder the costs of carrying greater inventory. Under the
just-in-time system, the chipmakers had held the inventory. As one
semiconductor CEO said earlier this year, the shortage has shifted the
balance of power: \"If they expect the semiconductor \[suppliers\] to be
the bank, to keep having a big working capital to support them, they can
forget it.\" Bottlenecks in the global supply chain threaten the
macroeconomic and microeconomic health of the United States. On the
macro side, supply chain issues are driving fears of inflation; if not
brought under control, this could cause the Fed to prematurely raise
interest rates. A related problem is consumer panic over rumored
shortages. See, for example, the effect of the ransomware attack on
Colonial Pipeline---drivers panicked and went to gas stations to top off
their tanks, temporarily worsening the problem. On the micro side, the
high price of inventories and shipping imperils market competition.
Supply risks privilege larger firms over small and medium enterprises.
Multinational corporations have the capacity to make large-scale
investments in resilience and robustness. They are also able to use
their market power to ensure continued access to scarce container
billets in ships; your local bodega, by contrast, is unable to charter
an entire container ship. The more stretched the global supply chain,
the more sectors that look like monopolies rather than a competitive
marketplace. When it comes to fixes, there has been a surplus of really
dumb ideas about what the government could do. Hawley\'s idea of
essentially nationalizing supply chains stands out as the dumbest. Such
a move would take well more than the three-year window he proposes to
execute. Prices would permanently rise due to new inefficiencies. The
opportunities for rent-seeking are legion; every sector would be
lobbying Washington that what they produce is \"critical.\" It is also
worth remembering that Hawley\'s go-to policies of protectionism and
immigration restriction shoulder much of the blame for the lack of truck
drivers that have contributed to delivery delays. The Biden
administration\'s responses have run the gamut. White House Press
Secretary Jen Psaki tried to laugh it all away by reducing the issue to
\"the tragedy of the treadmill that\'s delayed.\" That will not play
well with a country used to just-in-time delivery and trying to move
past the pandemic. Nor will Biden\'s proposal to open the port of Los
Angeles 24/7 have much of an effect. While ports are currently jammed,
there are also bottlenecks in railroad cars and truck drivers---both of
which are issues that predated the pandemic. Even if the port gets
unstuck, the traffic jam will just migrate to America\'s railroads and
highways. Looking at manufacturing more generally, some firms have
acknowledged that they were unaware of the geographic distribution of
their suppliers prior to the pandemic. This is one area where the Biden
administration\'s efforts to collect data on supply chains could be
useful. If the federal government can identify (or even stock) priority
components that would affect multiple sectors, those strategic reserves
could theoretically bolster the robustness of the U.S. economy. But not
if such investments become a stalking horse for protectionism.

\<\<\<Paragraph Breaks Resume\>\>\>

All of the evidence of the past year suggests that [[globalization helps
economies recover]{.mark} more [quickly from supply chain
difficulties]{.mark} than aggressive efforts at
homeshoring]{.underline}. This is because most [[shocks are
localized]{.mark}, and access to global value chains facilitates
**recovery more quickly**]{.underline}. Indeed, protectionism is partly
to blame for the current mess. As the Cato Institute\'s Scott Lincicome
recently noted, the Jones Act, which mandates use of U.S.-built, crewed,
and flagged ships to move cargo from one U.S. port to another, has
raised the costs of coastwise shipping, putting even more pressure on
truck and train transport.

### AT: Supply Chain\-\--Resillience\-\--1NC

#### China's decoupling from global supply chains, and self-sufficiency means it's insulated 

**Huang 20** \[Ruihan Huang, Director at Basilinna Advisor for
Geopolitical Research, \"The Supply Chain Being Threatened Is Not As
Fragile as Expected,\" Initiative For U.S.-China Dialogue On Global
Issues, 8-23-2020,

Though political risks generated by recent disputes and the pandemic
would not finally and fully decouple foreign companies' supply chains
from China in the next few years, [[China]{.mark} would manage to
[**reduce its reliance** on global supply chains,]{.mark} so China could
[achieve]{.mark} [a closed-loop supply chain to be **self-sufficient**
and **avoid attacks**]{.mark} and uncertainties brought by global
sanctions]{.underline}. As the Chinese old saying goes: to thrive in
calamity and perish in soft living, China really took painful lessons
from recent disputes, especially U.S. decisions to cut Huawei and ZTE
off from semiconductor suppliers. What's more, Western countries'
accusations and accompanied sanctions toward the Chinese government on
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang issues also have made the Chinese
government lose face and further give up its illusions and reliance on
western countries. As the only country with all industrial sectors,
China hopes to be able to achieve independent research and development
in key areas and also be self-sufficient to avoid foreign countries'
sanctions. In order to achieve this goal, the Chinese government
formulated the "Made in China 2025" plan and also invested a lot in
advanced manufacturing technologies, especially in China's weak research
fields. For example, in the field of semiconductors, China aims to
produce 70% of the semiconductors it uses by 2025 and in July 2020,
China's leading chip maker SMIC also prepared a \$6.55 billion stock
offering in order to shore up its semiconductor capabilities to catch up
with rivals TSMC and Samsung Electronic, two leading chipmakers in the
world.

It should also be noted that [being self-sufficient does not necessarily
mean China would eventually and completely decouple from global supply
chains.]{.underline} As the founder and CEO of Huawei Zhengfei Ren said,
"Huawei is willing to continue buying products from U.S. companies, but
"We don\'t see much impact of sanctions on what we are currently doing,"
because "we are very confident in our ability to use components made in
China and other countries." This is also the same logic for the Chinese
government: [embracing global supply chains can bring cheaper goods with
high quality to the Chinese market]{.underline}, but
[[self-reliance]{.mark} can [help]{.mark} [China **minimize** potential
**geopolitical risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus,
[[decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark} from the global supply chain [is not
the Chinese government's goal, but an [affordable]{.mark} and **[not
difficult option]{.mark}**]{.underline} of responding to an unfavorable
and harsh environment in the future.

All in all, [though]{.underline} the fears that political dissent and
uncertainties would drive [foreign companies to relocate its supply
chain away from China are valid, [China]{.mark} would still be [one of
the most **lucrative and attractive places**]{.mark} in the world [to
manufacture]{.mark} and maintain its status]{.underline} of world
factory for a very long time. Political dissent and uncertainties could
incentivize foreign companies to diversify their supply chains, but
supporting infrastructure and enormous potential consumers make it very
hard for them to totally shift their supply chains away from China.
However, the pressure exerted by western countries on China in recent
years would definitely motivate the only country with all industrial
sectors in the world to seek self-reliance without any hesitation.
Whether Western countries' sanctions toward China achieve their goals of
hindering China's development or actually boosting China's development,
we will see.

#### **Any Sort of Previous Multilat has failed**

**FOEI 24**, 9-16-2024, \"The Failure of the Current Multilateral
System,\" Friends of the Earth International,
https://www.foei.org/the-failure-of-the-current-multilateral-system/
//nishant

The world is grappling with unprecedented crisis---climate change,
pandemics, natural disasters, genocides, wars, and skyrocketing
inequality. [The international response]{.underline}, [led by the United
Nations]{.underline} and its multilateral system, **[has failed to offer
real solutions]{.underline}**. Instead, [global governance is dominated
by corporate interests]{.underline}, [perpetuating a system that
overlooks the needs of the majority]{.underline}, particularly in the
Global South. [Big Tech]{.underline}-led models of development [have
only deepened]{.underline} an already **[neocolonial]{.underline}** and
**[unsustainable geoeconomic order]{.underline}**. The upcoming Summit
of the Future risks becoming yet another exercise in maintaining the
status quo; legitimising an economy for billionaires. What the world
needs is a truly democratic global government---one that is inclusive,
accountable, and able to address the urgent challenges we face.

Who gets to define the future?

[Global governance is mired in escalating geopolitical
confrontations]{.underline} between Western powers (the US, EU, and
allies) and **[the rising influence of China and Russia]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, transnational corporations wield disproportionate control
over policy decisions, prioritizing profits at the expense of people and
the planet. T[his system **entrenches inequality** and environmental
destruction]{.underline}, [offering no real solutions to the world's
most urgent crises]{.underline}. The dominant trade and intellectual
property regimes have deepened the global innovation divide,
concentrating the benefits of technological progress---particularly in
data and AI---within a few U.S. and Chinese firms. As a result, much of
the world is relegated to exporting raw materials while importing
digital products and services, further entrenching dependency in global
digital value chains.

[The UN,]{.underline} once a beacon of hope for international
cooperation, [is now paralyzed by these dynamics]{.underline}.
[Democratic participation within the multilateral system has
eroded]{.underline}, with [decisions concentrated in the hands of a few
powerful countries and corporate stakeholders]{.underline}. The voices
of the Global South are marginalized and ignored.

In the Global South, there is growing frustration with the dominance of
developed countries and transnational corporations in global
decision-making. These entities obstruct progress on critical economic,
social, and environmental issues, leaving the majority of the world to
bear the brunt of the crises while their voices are sidelined. The
policies emanating from the current system have deepened inequality and
failed to address the root causes of global challenges.

There is no doubt, [this **failure has fueled the rise of far-right**
and **fascist movements** worldwide]{.underline}, [which capitalize on
the disillusionment of populations]{.underline} left behind by global
governance. [The surge of **ethno-nationalism**, **denial of science**,
and **normalization of hate speech**]{.underline} in algorithmic public
agoras [are **all symptoms of a broken system** that prioritizes
corporate interests over the well-being of people.]{.underline}

#### Multilateralism Fails

Hanns W. **Maull 20**, 1-13-2020, Adjunct Professor of International
Relations at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) Bologna
Center of John Hopkins University, \"Mind the Gap: Pitfalls of
Multilateralism,\" Heinrich Böll Stiftung,
https://www.boell.de/en/2020/01/13/mind-gap-pitfalls-multilateralism
//nishant

There can be no doubt [that the current U.S. administration's
commitment]{.underline} to the rules and norms of today's international
[order is limited and selective]{.underline}; [President Donald
Trump]{.underline}, it seems, [does not like rules and norms at
all]{.underline} -- [except when they serve his own
interests]{.underline}. Yet it is also somewhat odd to have China's
President Xi Jinping pose (as he famously did at the World Economic
Forum in Davos in February 2017) as the champion of a liberal
international order; China's policies often systematically violate the
spirit and even the letter of that order. [The final]{.underline}, and
in my view the only adequate, [definition of
multilateralism]{.underline} [sets the term in the context
of]{.underline} the huge demand for, and the **[inadequate supply of,
global governance]{.underline}**. This recognizes a) that the world has
a lot to do to secure a good future for mankind, and b) that this can be
achieved only through broad-based international cooperation and
integration. [There are simply **too many relevant parties** to any of
the major global challenge]{.underline}s -- [from climate change to arms
control and pandemics]{.underline} -- [for any unilateral or bilateral
efforts to succeed]{.underline}. Take global warming: even the two
biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, [China and the United States, could
not contain global warming below 2 degrees on their own, **nor by
working together bilaterally**]{.underline}. (This is not to say that
their cooperation would be irrelevant; on the contrary, if the United
States and China were able to agree on a joint approach towards the
problem of climate change, they could then bring others on board of
their solution. This is what made the Paris Agreement on Climate Change
at COP 21 possible in 2015).  This understanding of multilateralism
combines process with substance and ambition; implicitly, it also
provides benchmarks to measure the results of multilateral diplomacy.

When Washington, Beijing or Moscow, or even the European Union, today
pose as good multilateralists, scepticism seems warranted. Of course,
all diplomacy, including multilateral diplomacy, aims at pursuing
"national interests", that is, the objectives that governments define
for their countries. [Multilateralism therefore is a tool with which
**parties pursue their own objectives**]{.underline}. Yet only if the
respective definitions of what constitutes the "national interest"
include notions of a rules-based international order and ambitions to
tackle transnational challenges effectively, if  multilateralism becomes
an end, not only a means, will national policies be sustainable. Such a
demanding definition of multilateralism implies a commitment by
countries to forego possible short-term advantages for the sake of
protecting the rules, norms and effectiveness of the international
order. Put bluntly, governments need to understand that in the longer
run they have more to gain from following and thus helping to preserve
the rules, than by defying them for the sake of some immediate benefit. 
[At present, we observe a United States government whose commitment to
substantive multilateralism in this sense is **at best selective**, a
Russian regime that seems bent to **undermine any substantive
multilateralism**]{.underline} that does not conform to its own
ambitions, [and a Chinese government that, although committed to a
rules-based international order, wants to change the rules and control
the outcomes]{.underline}. It is hardly surprising, [therefore, that
multilateralism today **often degenerates into empty posturing**, or
even worse: a mimicry of effective action.]{.underline}

Yet even if governments were seriously committed to [effective
multilateralism in its most demanding form]{.underline} (and even
Germany, which likes to portrait itself as an exemplary multilateralist,
in fact has a rather mixed record on this), multilateralism **[is far
from being a panacea]{.underline}**. On the contrary, [it is a **highly
demanding** form of international diplomacy, with lots of built-in
pitfalls that need constant attention and persistent political efforts
to avoid]{.underline}. Thus, [multilateralism is **unwieldy** and
**cumbersome**. Its agenda tends to become **diffuse** and
**overcrowded**]{.underline}, all the parties involved have different
priorities that they all want to see included in the outcome. [It
therefore becomes **difficult to set priorities**]{.underline} and avoid
being side-tracked from the most important issues. [Multilateral
negotiations also take time, sometimes a lot of time; this intensifies
the difficulty of setting]{.underline} (and meeting) deadlines that
reflect objective constraints and the urgency of issues. [The outcomes
of multilateral diplomacy usually **require implementation** by national
governments;]{.underline} [this raises issues of monitoring and domestic
application to deliver on national commitments.]{.underline}

(CN) --- The [transatlantic alliance has had its rough patches, but not
like anything that\'s happening now.]{.underline}

[In the short time since]{.underline} U.S. President Donald
[**[Trump]{.mark}** returned to the White House, a **[great and growing
rift]{.mark}** has opened up [between **America and Europe**]{.mark} and
there may be [**no going back**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["It is **[unlike and worse than]{.mark}** any hiccup in transatlantic
relations since the **[Second World War]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said
Brigid Laffan, an Irish emeritus professor of political science at the
European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

"[It\'s **[very clear]{.mark}** that the **[Trump]{.mark}**
administration has a particular visceral [**dislike of the EU**
and]{.mark} therefore of [Europe]{.mark} more generally]{.underline},"
she said, "and has [**[turned]{.mark}** traditional **[allies]{.mark}**
of the United States **[into
adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

Manlio Graziano, an Italian geopolitics professor at Sciences Po and
Sorbonne University in Paris, said the discord could lead to a lasting
divorce.

"[Without doubt, we are at a completely **[new stage in
relations]{.mark}** between the United States and Europe]{.underline},"
he said. "I wouldn\'t yet call it a rupture, though there are certainly
the conditions to lead to a rupture."

[One thing is clear]{.underline}, he added: [[**Trust in the United
States is broken and it\'s not coming back** even if]{.mark} the next
president after Trump [is a Democrat]{.mark} who [wants to revive
transatlantic ties]{.mark}.]{.underline} Europeans, Graziano said,
simply won\'t count on another Trump-like figure not returning to the
Oval Office one day.

"[[The United States has **lost credibility**]{.mark}," he said, "and it
[**won\'t ever get it back**, never again]{.mark}."]{.underline}

He added: "[Today, the United States is a much bigger danger to Europe
than Russia. Not because the United States wants to attack Europe, but
because [the **United States wants to weaken
Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

On Friday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance rubbed more salt in the wounds
by leading an [American delegation to Greenland]{.underline}, a
semi-autonomous Danish territory that [Trump openly talks about
annexing, to the stunned disbelief and anger of Europeans.]{.underline}

[Every day, it seems, another plank in the transatlantic bridge falls
into the turbulent waters below.]{.underline}

This was a particularly bad week after the Trump team\'s animosity
toward Europe was revealed in Signal texts inadvertently leaked when
Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was included in a
White House group chat about a pending bombing of the Houthi militant
group in Yemen, which has attacked ships in the Red Sea in a bid to
force Israel to stop its assault on the Gaza Strip.

Part of the discussion on Signal showed the White House officials
complaining about how Europe should be the one striking the Houthis
because U.S. commerce doesn\'t rely on the Suez Canal.

"@Pete Hegseth: if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate
bailing Europe out again," Vance wrote to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth
on March 14.

"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's
PATHETIC," Hegseth wrote back.

But Hegseth said the U.S. had to carry out the attacks with the aim of
opening the shipping lane because European navies were incapable.

"\[W\]e are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who
can do this. Nobody else even close," Hegseth wrote.

In an earlier text, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz told the
group European navies "do not have the capability to defend against the
types of sophisticated, anti-ship, cruise missiles, and drones the
Houthis are now using."

Waltz said the U.S. should "levy" the costs of the operation "on the
Europeans."

[[After]{.mark} the **[Signal texts]{.mark}** became public and turned
into a scandal, [Trump]{.mark} doubled down and **[called out
Europe]{.mark}** for "freeloading." Trump has long complained about NATO
allies not spending enough on defense and unfairly placing barriers on
American exports such as food and cars.]{.underline}

Asked by reporters if he agreed with Hegseth\'s comments, Trump
answered: "Yeah, I think they\'ve been freeloading. The European
Union\'s been absolutely terrible to us on trade, terrible."

[**More planks** on the transatlantic bridge are **expected to fall**
next week when [Trump]{.mark} says he will **[announce]{.mark}** a slew
of **[new tariffs]{.mark}**]{.underline} on April 2, what he\'s dubbed
"Liberation Day." [[European goods]{.mark} are expected to be
[hit]{.mark} [hard]{.mark} and a [full-blown trade war]{.mark} seems
likely.]{.underline}

A February speech Vance made at the Munich Security Conference can be
seen as the defining moment that crystallized a breakup in the making.

In the speech, the vice president accused European leaders of betraying
democracy by blocking far-right nationalist parties into government and
for seeking to curtail the spread of far-right viewpoints, which he
called censorship.

Vance also said it was deeply undemocratic to annul presidential
elections in Romania last December over allegations they were
compromised by Russian interference. Călin Georgescu, a far-right,
pro-Russian and anti-NATO candidate, was on track to win the elections
before the race was canceled. Since then, Georgescu has been banned from
running in the fresh elections and faces charges of undermining the
constitutional order.

Vance\'s statements made it clear America under Trump stands on the side
of the far right in Europe and far-right leaders like Hungarian Prime
Minister Viktor Orbán who want to wreck the EU and its pan-European aims
based around liberal democracy, the rule of law and free markets.

"You have an administration, not just Trump, but many in the
administration, who not only do not see the value of a European Union,
but they are actively trying to undermine Europe," said Scott Lucas, a
professor of international politics at University College Dublin.

An impending breakup

Of course, [this isn\'t the first rough moment in transatlantic
relations. Indeed, the friendship has long been marked by discord and
mistrust.]{.underline}

There was former French President Charles de Gaulle, who kicked American
troops off French soil in 1966. Burning American flags was commonplace
during anti-war protests in the late 1960s. In the 1970s, Europeans
marched against the placement of U.S. nuclear warheads in their
countries.

In the 1980s, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan blasted Europeans for
buying oil and natural gas from the Soviet Union. In 2003, after France
refused to back the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the cafeteria in the U.S.
Congress renamed French fries to "freedom fries."

But [these spats in the past did not present a "**systemic challenge**"
to the alliance like what\'s taking place now]{.underline}, Lucas said.

In part, the [[Trump]{.mark} administration\'s [antagonism toward the
EU]{.mark} can be [explained by its **dislike** for **multilateral
organizations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Lucas said.

"This is a transactional administration," he said. "It is the idea that
they don\'t really think of win-win politics, they think win-lose
politics."

He said this approach is domineering in both domestic and foreign
affairs.

"The idea is that you don\'t need the courts, you don\'t need Congress,
you don\'t need the U.S. agencies, you just need loyalists," he said.
"[They pursue an autocratic approach to foreign policy and that you
don\'t need allies. You don\'t need partnerships as such. You simply
need transactions where you can reap a profit from it]{.underline}."

Today\'s Europe was born from the ashes of World War II and the EU was
built with consensus and multilateralism at its core with the idea that
this model would prevent another descent into war, Lucas said.

But he said the Trump administration seems void of the "collective
memory" of the horrors of World War II and the necessity to uphold
multilateralism to prevent war.

"[You\'re in an **[existential moment]{.mark}**, not just for the EU and
U.S. but [for the whole notion of **international
order**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. "[For the first time since the
late \'40s, you have got a [**major actor** who **doesn\'t believe**
in]{.mark} those [rules]{.mark} in that order and **[that\'s the
U.S]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

He predicted the looming breakup between the U.S. and EU may happen
quickly.

"I don\'t think it\'s going to be slow and gradual necessarily," he
said. "It could be much more quick than we realize."

He [said Europe has the economic might to go its own way and that new
alliances are forming as Canada, Europe, Australia and others see the
need of building bridges]{.underline}.

Laffan said Europe will respond to the rupture with the U.S. by building
up its own militaries and forging new alliances, as seen with efforts by
French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
to muster a "coalition of the willing" to send peacekeeping troops to
Ukraine.

"That program is already underway and will continue because the
Europeans are not going to say, \'Roll over us, we\'re not interested in
our future prosperity or our future security,\'" she said. "They\'re
going to take agency."

Amid this turmoil, she said the EU sees Ukraine\'s fate as its most
pressing concern because it cannot allow Trump to force Kyiv into
capitulating to Russia.

"If there is a ceasefire or peace process, would this be a capitulation
of Ukraine? In which case, Europe then has a very unstable Russian
domination in the near-abroad, which is very dangerous," she said. "Or
can those countries like Ukraine and Moldova continue to aspire to a
European future, which is what their people want?"

[Though [satellite imagery]{.mark} data offers new
opportunities,]{.underline} [it also [poses new **challenges**]{.mark}
for empirical modeling. Satellite-based [land-use
datasets]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[suffer from]{.mark} some level of
**[misclassification error]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Such
misclassification implies that the dependent variable in a discrete
choice land-use model may be misclassified. Although misclassification,
and more [[generally measurement error]{.mark}, [is found in many
datasets, ignoring it]{.mark} in discrete choice models [results in
**inconsistent** parameter estimates]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hausman et
al., 1998[). The **consequences** of, and corrections for,
misclassification error are well addressed in the epidemiology
literat]{.underline}ure (e.g., in the context of health treatment
effects); however, misclassification errors have not been considered in
the context of empirical land-use modeling.

The application in the Northern Great Plains demonstrates the importance
of correcting for misclassification errors. We use the Northern Great
Plains for an application because temperate grasslands are at high risk
of conversion to cropland, and such conversion threatens the habitat of
many threatened or special conservation status species. Moreover,
empirically modeling grassland in the region is challenging because
commonly available datasets are too aggregated or do not explicitly
categorize grassland; thus, satellite imagery is potentially the best
source of data to monitor and model grassland. Grassland landcovers in
satellite imagery data, however, suffer from high rates of
misclassification. [Our [empirical results demonstrate that bias]{.mark}
caused by ignoring **misclassification** [can be]{.mark} [substantial
and thus could affect policy inference]{.mark}. Given that land-use
models are often used to derive the implications of alternative policies
(e.g., subsidies) or external shocks (e.g., climate change), our results
suggest that [**ignoring** misclassification could lead to **incorrect
inference**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One of the major advantages of the satellite remote sensing is the

and spatial variability [are **not fully
captured**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this regard, high-orbit
geostationary observations (GEO) address this limitation by providing
frequent diurnal observation of the same object. However, [[there is a
**trade-off** between spatial coverage and]{.mark} the
[resolution]{.mark} of satellite images (usually [higher coverage
results in]{.mark} [lower spatial resolution]{.mark})]{.underline}.
[[Achieving]{.mark} observations with [both]{.mark} extensive
spatial-temporal coverage and high spatial resolution
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} desirable for many applications, but also
**[[highly challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, the design of
satellite observations may need new innovations, ancillary data, and
synergies of complimentary observations to address specific objects and
relevant problems. This is discussed further in the next section.

### AT: Heg\-\--Non-Unique Trump\-\--2AC

#### Trump already degraded US-led liberal order.

[Donald [Trump's victory]{.mark} has had a **[major
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the [international
situation]{.underline}, accelerating the [convulsive
tendencies]{.underline} towards the
**[[decomposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the [[U.S.-led liberal
order]{.underline}]{.mark} that emerged from the post-Cold War period.

The [[perception of instability]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[disorder]{.underline}]{.mark} is expressed in all
[spheres]{.underline}, from the **[[escalating
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [global dimension]{.underline}, such
as the war between [[Russia]{.mark} and [Ukraine]{.mark}/[NATO]{.mark}
and [Israel's war in the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}, to
[[interstate]{.mark} tensions and political
**[crises]{.mark}**]{.underline} in peripheral and central countries. To
give just a few examples, in the last weeks of the year the coalition
government in Germany collapsed; the Prime Minister of France fell,
deepening the Macron crisis; an attempted self-coup by the President of
South Korea failed; and the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria collapsed
after a lightning offensive by Islamist militias. In these conditions
new political and class struggle phenomena are developing.

Since the [crisis of [2008]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[[marked]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[exhaustion of the **neoliberal
hegemony**]{.underline}]{.mark} (hyperglobalization plus liberal
democracy) a [[new stage]{.underline}]{.mark} has opened up with the
[[reactivation]{.mark} of the [deep tendencies]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the [[imperialist]{.mark} epoch of [wars]{.mark}, [crises, and
revolutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lenin). This is [[manifested
in]{.mark} the return to [rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline} between [[great
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, wars of [[global]{.mark}
[dimension]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[militarism]{.underline}]{.mark},
developing and open [[organic crises]{.underline}]{.mark}, the collapse
of the [**[neoliberal center]{.underline}**, [asymmetrical political
polarization]{.underline}]{.mark} (for now, more intense on the extreme
right), and Bonapartist [[degradation of liberal
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the basis of the [[neoliberal
heritage of profound **inequality** and **social
fragmentation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### New Trump administration ensures US loses global economic influence now.

**Cinatti '25** \[Claudia; 01/10/2025; editor of La Izquierda Diario;
Trump and the Decline of U.S. Hegemony: A Global Perspective,

akshaj\]

[[Economic and Geopolitical Tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [structural [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} of this [[new
stage]{.mark} are the [decline of the **leadership** of the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose capacity to [impose
[order]{.mark}]{.underline} has **[[deteriorated]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
the emergence of [[China]{.mark} as a [competing
power]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading a [bloc with
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} (joined by other countries in conflict with
the West, such as Iran and North Korea); and the [emergence of [middle
powers with **diverse capacities**]{.mark} to manage their alignments
according to their national interests.]{.underline}

Trump is both a symptom of this hegemonic crisis and an attempt to
"force a solution," to try to [**[recompose]{.mark}** the [power of
U.S.]{.mark} imperialism]{.underline}, [formulated]{.underline} in the
key of a sort of "sui generis realism." The [[future Trump]{.mark}
Administration has appropriated both the
[isolationist]{.mark}]{.underline} slogan of "**[[America
First]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and the Reaganite maxim of [imposing
"peace through force]{.underline}."

Judging by his first term and the makeup of his future cabinet, it is
likely that [Trump will [repeat]{.mark} the [recipe of]{.mark} what
[international relations]{.mark}]{.underline} analysts define as
"**[[mercantile diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**." This consists of
[[prioritizing **tariffs** and **economic sanctions**]{.mark} as a
method of [disciplining competitors]{.mark}]{.underline}, in addition to
variable quotas of protectionism whose [maximum expression is the [trade
war with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. This mercantile diplomacy of sticks
(tariffs, sanctions, and trade wars) and carrots (reformulation of
bilateral treaties) is backed by the [[deployment of the
military]{.mark} apparatus to play a dissuasive role]{.underline}, that
is to say, militarism, but [not]{.underline} necessarily the
[interventionist]{.underline}, [[neoconservative style of
**warmongering**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The success of this [Trumpist [scheme]{.mark}]{.underline} in his first
term is highly debatable. What has been established as [[state]{.mark}
policy is [hostility]{.mark} [towards China]{.mark}]{.underline}
(continued by Biden). This has served primarily to [delay and
[hinder]{.mark}]{.underline}, though [[not prevent]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[China's development]{.underline}]{.mark} of [and [access to]{.mark}
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence [technology for military
use]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, the [**[effectiveness]{.mark}** of the trade war is
[questionable]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of its impact on reducing
the [U.S. [trade deficit]{.mark} and competition]{.underline} in other
markets. Moreover, [[China remains the **main trading
partner**]{.underline}]{.mark} of a large [number of
countries]{.underline}, including those in the [[direct **sphere of
influence**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the United States, such as Latin
America. This means that [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}, in its
"**[[decoupling]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [with the Chinese
economy]{.underline}, has [[not]{.mark} been able to [advance to the
point of]{.mark} imposing the [choice]{.mark} between one of the two
sides]{.underline} as it did during the Cold War. It is unlikely to do
so, even if there is permanent tension. Perhaps the most eloquent
example is that of the Milei government in Argentina. Though an
unconditional servant of the [[United States]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
has had to admit that it [[cannot do without its relationship with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. This somersault is remarkable. President
Milei went from swearing that he would never do business with communists
to perceiving the [Chinese government]{.underline} as an "[[interesting
partner that asks for nothing except not to be
bothered]{.underline}]{.mark}."

In [contrast to 2016]{.underline}, when the [**[central
problem]{.mark}** of the [United States]{.mark}]{.underline} was to [put
an end to the war]{.underline} in Afghanistan by trying to disguise its
defeat, the second Trump presidency inherits an international situation
that has "pre-1914" elements. A situation in which, as historian
Christopher Clark would say, its main protagonists seem to be
[sleep[walking towards a **conflagration** of global
dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. To put it more precisely, we are not at
the beginning of World War III, but there has been a [leap in the
[**militarism** of the **great powers**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Russia escalation past the tipping points deterrence can't solve.

[Ukraine and the Middle East: **The [Global]{.mark} Dimension of
[Conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [[dynamics of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Russian-Ukrainian]{.mark}/NATO]{.underline} war and [Israel's war in
the Middle East]{.underline} are [[showing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[deep]{.mark} [**interrelation** of these
conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} and their [global dimension by
[involving]{.mark} the major [Western powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the [[bloc]{.mark} formed [by China and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[later]{.underline} joined by [Iran and North Korea]{.underline}.

The Russia-Ukraine/NATO war has [entered a **[dangerous
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} as both [sides]{.underline} try to
become better [positioned for an eventual negotiation to end the
war]{.underline}, a possibility which appears to be on Trump's agenda.

By [way of a parting shot]{.underline}, President Biden, followed by
other [[NATO allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[crossed]{.underline}]{.mark}
his last "[red [line]{.mark}]{.underline}" and [[authorized]{.mark}
Ukraine to use **[offensive weaponry]{.mark}**]{.underline} to directly
[attack Russian territory]{.underline}. A [dangerous
evolution]{.underline} of ["proxy" warfare]{.underline}. In response,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[revised]{.underline}]{.mark} his
**[[nuclear doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- although without making
the leap to the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Putin has also
redoubled the attack on Ukraine, especially on civilian and energy
infrastructure, by incorporating tens of thousands of North Korean
soldiers into the ranks of the Russian army.

It is already a fact admitted by Zelenskyy himself that
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} will have to [[give up part of its
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}. The discussion is now how much of what
Russia has occupied in these almost three years of war they will keep.
In exchange for [accepting this loss, and as payment for his services
fighting a "proxy" war]{.underline} of the West against Russia,
Zelenskyy [[hopes]{.mark} that his Western [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}
will at least [[give]{.mark} him some guarantee of
[security]{.mark}]{.underline} and ideally admit Ukraine to the EU
and/or NATO (both very improbable). Moreover, his [political future is
at stake]{.underline} in a [[country devastated by
**destruction**]{.mark} and **[massive debt]{.mark}** to the
IMF]{.underline}. A [debt]{.underline} [[not forgiven by the Western
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} in spite of the services rendered.

In addition to territorial conquests, [[Putin's objective]{.mark} is to
make impossible any scenario of [incorporating]{.mark} Ukraine, and [by
extension]{.mark} Moldova and Georgia]{.underline}, into enemy blocs.
The [[current **crisis** in Georgia]{.underline}]{.mark}, with
[[massive]{.mark} [mobilizations]{.mark} against the government's
[**suspension** of negotiations]{.mark} with]{.underline} the
[EU]{.underline}, is reminiscent of those in Maidan Square and [shows
the [**magnitude** of the geopolitical dispute]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### [THUMPED]{.underline}. Trump's a [rogue]{.underline} actor and there is [no]{.underline} coming back. Attempting to [come-back]{.underline} such results in [international]{.underline} backlash.

ญ

On Tuesday, [[Mike **Waltz**]{.underline}]{.mark}, President
[Trump's [**former** national **security
adviser**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [faced]{.underline} a [[**grilling** in
the **Senate** as he seeks]{.mark} his [next
job]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark} U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.  

In his confirmation hearing, [**Waltz** [spun]{.mark} himself
[as]{.mark} a [tough **advocate for American
interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} he kept
[[bumping]{.underline}]{.mark} up [[against]{.mark} the [same
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline}: [in spite of]{.underline} the robust
"[America First]{.underline}" [rhetoric]{.underline}, the
[**[Trump]{.mark}** [**admin**istration i]{.mark}s taking steps that
**[will weaken American leverage]{.mark}** at the U.N.]{.underline} 

The [stakes are high]{.underline}. The [U.N. remains the world's
preeminent global forum]{.underline}, where [countries gather
to]{.underline} exchange views and [set rules for the
future]{.underline}. The central issues of our time --- geopolitical
competition, conflict, nuclear proliferation, global health and emerging
technology --- play out at the U.N. and its many agencies.

Yet the [**U.N.** has **struggled**]{.underline} in recent years. Its
Security Council has been deadlocked, with [Russia **using** its
**veto** to get away with an illegal war of aggression against
Ukraine]{.underline}. China is increasingly throwing around its
weight, demanding more influence in the organization and watering
down the U.N.'s work on human rights. The U.N.'s bureaucracy
has struggled to streamline and focus its work. 

The war in Gaza has further challenged the organization. After Hamas's
Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attacks in Israel, far too many countries at the
U.N. refused to condemn the atrocity --- a moral failure casting a long
shadow. Since then, Israel's brutal war on Gaza, including illegal
obstruction of humanitarian assistance and obscene levels of civilian
harm, has further poisoned the atmosphere. 

Despite these challenges, [**decisions** are still made at the U.N.
every day that **impact American interests at home** and
abroad]{.underline}. The [organization also retains a great capacity to
contain and end wars before they spread]{.underline} and require U.S.
intervention. U.N. human rights monitors, while not perfect, help
promote accountability for violations in places such as Iran, Sudan and
North Korea. 

Debates in U.N. technical bodies and standard-setting agencies affect
many American economic sectors, such as telecommunications,
biopharmaceutical research and agriculture. The U.N. is also playing a
key role in establishing global rules and principles for the development
and use of artificial intelligence. 

While [[**Trump complains** about global **freeloading**, the U.N. **is
actually** an **effective**]{.mark} burden-sharing
[mechanism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.N.'s 193 member countries pool
their dues to tackle shared challenges, such as responding to
humanitarian disasters. Countries come together to collectively fund and
supply nearly 70,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops to help protect civilians
and stabilize troubled regions. 

Given the breadth of U.S. equities at stake, senators wanted to hear
from Waltz a credible strategy to strengthen American leverage at the
U.N. and enact needed reforms there. Every American, Republican and
Democrat, agrees that the U.S., not our adversaries, should prevail in
shaping outcomes at the U.N.

[[Waltz had a chance]{.mark} to explain how he would work there to
promote peace and strengthen U.S. security]{.underline}, protect
American jobs, [spur innovation and advance American
values]{.underline}, particularly human rights. [But Waltz [**could
not** explain away Trump]{.mark} administration [decisions that will
make it much harder for any]{.mark} U.S. [ambassador to stand up for
American interests]{.mark} at the U.N.]{.underline} 

For example, [Trump]{.underline} has [proposed that the U.S. cease
paying its U.N. dues]{.underline}, which amount to around a quarter of
the organization's budget. In addition to [gutting essential U.N.
functions]{.underline}, this would create an opening for Beijing and
other countries to expand their influence at the organization through
stepped-up donations

[[Trump's withdrawal]{.underline}]{.mark} from U.N. bodies,
[[such]{.mark} as the **[W]{.mark}**orld **[H]{.mark}**ealth
**[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline} and Human Rights Council, has
similarly abandoned the field to other countries, including those that
do not share our values. [You can't fight for American interests if
you're not in the room]{.underline}. 

Waltz's job would also be much more difficult thanks to last
week's bloodbath at the State Department, where more than 1,300 national
security professionals were fired without cause. [The]{.underline}
[[Trump]{.mark} administration claimed that this blow to [U.S. diplomacy
was]{.mark} about "efficiency" and "streamlining"]{.underline} --- [this
is **hogwash**]{.underline}. These arbitrary and ill-conceived firings
will unquestionably deprive our government of critical talent and
expertise. [Former U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations]{.underline} Susan Rice [called the mass firings]{.underline}
"**[[superpower suicide]{.underline}]{.mark}**," as she [imagined the
champagne corks popping in Beijing and Moscow]{.underline}. 

Ironically, Mike Waltz has been known as a "China hawk," someone who has
long believed that the United States is in a high-stakes competition
with China. In his confirmation hearing, he emphasized that countering
China at the U.N. is "absolutely is critical" --- a view shared by both
Democrats and Republicans. Yet, [deep down]{.underline}, Waltz must
surely realize that [[Trump's actions will make it harder to push back
on Beijing's]{.mark} influence at the U.N]{.underline}.

[Intensification of De-dollarization]{.underline}

The process through [which [nations]{.mark} and economic actors
**[lessen their]{.mark} heavy [dependence]{.mark}** [on the US
dollar]{.mark}]{.underline} as a medium of exchange reserve currency and
unit of account is cumulatively referred to as \"de-dollarization,\" a
concept which has gained wide acceptance in the field of international
economics and international relations. This move emphasized shifting
away from the US dollar, which has occupied a very dominant position in
the world financial system, is a crucial transformation with important
consequences for the future of global commerce, investment, and monetary
policy. Firstly, the significant growth in the GDP of non-US nations has
resulted in a profound evolution of the multipolar global economic
system[. The [US\']{.mark}s [contribution to global GDP
**decreased**]{.mark} from 40% in 1960 to 24% in 2021. The [GDP of Asia
increased]{.mark} from 20% of the global GDP forty or fifty years ago to
47% in 2021]{.underline}. Cipriani et al., (2023). The contribution of
China\'s economy to global economic growth has stabilized at around 30
percent during the last ten years. China\'s two-year average economic
growth rate reached 5.1% even throughout the past two years of the
global pandemic, placing it top among the world\'s major economies and
maintaining its position as the main driver of global economic growth.
In the decades following World War II, this altered the United States\'
long-standing role as the global economy\'s engine. The international
structure is determined by the economic foundation, and in order to make
international payment settlements, balance-of-payments adjustments,
etc., easier, more sovereign currencies are needed. [Moreover, the
[de-dollarization]{.mark} of the global economy **[is
accelerating]{.mark}** as a result of the changes in the worldwide power
structure and the new technological revolution that has occurred since
the start of the financial crisis in 2008. The US dollar\'s credibility
continues to be overdrawn by the US. President Trump waged
\"[trade]{.mark} wars,\" \"[tariff wars]{.mark},\" and engaged in
\"zero-sum games\" while operating [under]{.mark} the so-called
\"[America First]{.mark}\" principle, gravely [**undermining American
influence** on the world stage]{.mark}. The [Trump]{.mark} government\'s
economic and [trade policies]{.mark} remained unchanged after the Biden
administration took office, which [allowed the value of the US **dollar
to decline irrevocably**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to this,
following the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve\'s \"unlimited
quantitative easing\" programme flooded the US dollar with liquidity.
The Federal Reserve\'s balance sheet increased from around \$4 trillion
in March 2020 to more than \$9 trillion at the moment, which is ten
times the size of the balance sheet the Federal Reserve had before the
financial crisis of 2008 (Ghazani et al., 2023). [The cost of the
COVID-19 pandemic is being passed through by the Federal Reserve, which
is obviously taking advantage of its special position within the context
of the US currency. It\'s your problem, not ours, as former US Treasury
Secretary John Connally famously declared in the 1970s regarding the US
dollar. The way China emerged, particularly in the COVID-19 era,
attracted [the world audience]{.mark} to [rely]{.mark} [upon an
alternative to the]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} as a global
hegemon]{.underline}. China has managed to gather pro-China states under
a single platform to revitalize the economic and strategic affairs.
Third, the global production division has undergone a recent adjustment.
[Globalization slowed considerably in the wake of the 2008 financial
crisis, but [the **push for localizing industry** rose]{.mark}.
Geopolitical and risk-aversion motivations will also contribute to the
regionalization and localization of the industrial chain, which will
become a trend in the near future. The entire global industrial chain
will be broken up into numerous region-sized chunks]{.underline}. The
finest companies in the world will carry out a professional division of
production at regional levels and build vertically integrated clusters,
which will result in a greater quantity of benefits for the host
countries. This globalization trend embodies the purported fairness of
production organization and promotes the development of regional
economies. [Fourth, **digital technology** will enable a smart,
decentralized evolution of the global industrial chain.]{.underline}
(Prasad, 2023). Manufacturing will become more sophisticated and varied
as a result of the continued development and commercialization of
information technologies, including cloud computing, industrial
internet, and automation. [It will also satisfy the requirements of risk
dispersion while shortening and flattening the industrial chain,
enhancing the cluster model of vertical integration of the
aforementioned industrial chains, and speeding up the structure of the
global industrial chain]{.underline}. Blockchain\'s value neutrality and
security are greatly bolstering the legitimacy of digital currencies and
giving countries new options as the US dollar\'s standing declines. The
impact of digital technology on the US currency system is more profound.
United States should not worry about the end of the U.S. dollar\'s
current global hegemony but should worry about the status of the U.S.
dollar under new financial technologies like digital currency. Regarding
the development and enhancement of the global monetary system, we should
nevertheless maintain objectivity and reason. However, it is clear from
economic history that changing and adjusting the global monetary system
would not happen overnight. There will be repeated portions of a
protracted historical process.

De-dollarization Trends in the Global Economy

There are manifold aspects of de-dollarization in the global economy.
[The [pace]{.mark} of de-dollarization [increased when the]{.mark}
[U.S.]{.mark} and its ally states [sanctioned Russia]{.mark} to curb its
economic growth and halt the Ukrainian war. Moreover, the increasing
interest of China in the global economy attracted more states to its
camp to challenge the rule-based liberal world order and to **demand
alternative world order** based on equal distribution of
resources]{.underline}. It is noteworthy that states have already
initiated the discovery of forums that favour the de-dollarization of
the global economy[. The primary objective is to get rid of U.S.
influence in world affairs. (]{.underline}Li, 2023). The Middle Eastern
states are on the front line to challenge the hegemonic role of the U.S.
in the global economy. It is also interesting to note that Saudi Arabia
has sold \$62 billion worth of US debt in total since 2020, a cumulative
sell-off of 35%. Saudi Arabia recently boosted its contribution,
primarily in response to the U.S. enforcing the NOPEC Act against Saudi
Arabia. The NOPEC Act, according to Saudi Arabia, was the reason behind
not using the US dollar in oil dealings. The system\'s cracks are
getting wider. A different mechanism for settling international trade
disputes has also become a reality. [[In order to avoid the
U.S.-dominated]{.mark} global financial payment and settlement
[system]{.mark}, an increasing number of [economies]{.mark} have built
or [are creating]{.mark} [their own]{.mark} **independent [payment
systems]{.mark}** in recent years -contrary to the U.S. economic
policies of promoting dollarization. The year 2019 saw the launch of an
EU trade settlement support mechanism for Iran, announced by Germany,
France, and the UK to trade in currencies other than the dollar. The
Instex (Instrument to Support Trade Transactions) method was developed
with the goal of facilitating non-dollar, non-SWIFT transactions and
evading American sanctions. To lessen its reliance on the US currency,
India has also built an Indian rupee settlement system for foreign
trade. The worldwide reserve currency system will continue to
de-dollarize but at a faster rate. In addition to this, The Bank of
Israel started diversifying its foreign exchange holdings this year, and
it plans to lower the proportion. Furthermore, the U.S. dollar\'s share
of Brazil\'s foreign currency reserves decreased by 5.69 percentage
points from the 2020 level to 80.34 per cent in 2021]{.underline}, the
lowest level since 2014, according to the Central Bank of Brazil\'s
report on the management ofinternational reserves-an indication of less
reliance on U.S. dollars. [On the other hand, the [proportion of Chinese
Yuan]{.mark} in Brazil\'s foreign exchange [reserves]{.mark}
respectively [increased]{.mark} from 1.21 per cent in 2020 to 4.99 per
cent in 2021, reaching its greatest level since the Yuan was added to
its currency basket in 2019 and ranking as the country\'s third-largest
foreign exchange asset]{.underline}. China and Brazil agreed to settle
trades in each other\'s currencies last week. Brazil, a country with
abundant natural resources, has switched from trading with the United
States to China over the previous 15 years. This change may have been
inevitable. [But in light of recent events, it appears that **[this is
just the latest]{.mark}** in a string of recent setbacks for the
dollar\'s dominant position in world trade.]{.underline} (Thiagarajan et
al., 2023). A strategic agreement to expand the Yuan settlement for oil
and gas trade was also agreed at the first China-Gulf Arab States
Cooperation Council summit. (Osama et al., 2023). All of these events
and China\'s economic diplomacy demonstrate how [the depth and speed of
the de-dollarization process are increasing]{.underline}. Rather than a
single hegemony in the global economy, the international monetary system
will be developed into one that would be characterized by a superpower
and other significant leading participants. [[A multipolar
international]{.mark} [monetary system can]{.mark}, to some extent,
[restrain the U.S. dollar]{.mark}\'s excessive privileges and perks due
to the internationalization of sovereign currencies in developing
economies.]{.underline} [In a polarized world, it is necessary to
increase the counterweight to the dollar\'s hegemony in order to achieve
national objectives]{.underline}. The formation of an alternative trade
settlement system requires the opening of the path for the balanced
growth of multi-polarization in the global monetary system. The news
that countries that produce oil, including Iran and especially
Washington\'s loyal friend Saudi Arabia, will consider selling oil in
currencies other than the dollar has called into further question the
US\'s dominance. Following the inaugural China-Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Summit in 2022, China stated that it would keep importing crude
oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the GCC.De-dollarization
efforts are now being coordinated by several nations and international
cooperation organizations, such as BRICS. Globally, developing nations
want a more solid financial mechanism as a replacement channel for
carrying out financial transactions in light of the US dollar\'s waning
predominance. International forums like the BRICS are attempting to find
solutions. Russia suggested in June at a BRICS-related meeting that it
is pushing the creation of a reserve currency based on the BRICS
currency basket. (Liu & Papa, 2022). In order to help European
businesses avoid US dollar settlements, Germany, the UK, and France
founded the INSTEX system in 2019. Since then, more and more nations
have joined the system. Five ASEAN economies came to an agreement in
July to plan to construct a regional integrated payment network in order
to forgo the US currency for direct foreign exchange settlement. This is
one of several developments in Asia in July, including the inauguration
of an international trade rupee settlement mechanism by the Central Bank
of India. This collaboration, meanwhile, is still in its infancy. It is
important to examine how all parties may improve international
coordination. For many economies, improving global coordination for
de-dollarization is primarily a political choice rather than an economic
one. Countries all across the world should adopt a longer-term
perspective and work to improve de-dollarization coordination in light
of the changing geopolitical scenario and the effects of a strong
dollar[. The issue of [lessening reliance on the U.S. dollar **is
being**]{.mark} [**solved** by]{.mark} using [euro]{.mark}, [yen, and
pound]{.mark} in financial transactions and moving towards local
currency settlement]{.underline}, which was brought up at the Meeting of
ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on March 28 in
Indonesia. To enable its member nations to use local currencies for
commerce, ASEAN will further expand and extend the local currency
trading (LCT) concept, which was previously attempted as a digital
currency. The Indonesian banking authority had previously said that
Indonesian banks were getting ready to progressively phase out VISA and
MasterCard in favour of the launch of their own national payment system.
Middle Eastern nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
are working to diversify the currencies used for oil transaction
settlement. Chinese-Brazilian trade is simply the most recent example of
a developing trend that has seen the settlement basis change from
dollars to Yuan-real. Political neutrality in reserve currencies has
been a topic of discussion for many years. But after being kicked out of
dollar-based trading systems like SWIFT, Iran and, more recently, Russia
faced severe economic disruptions that have prompted several countries
to begin making immediate contingency plans. Saudi Arabia and other oil
exporters have long been warned against abandoning the dollar, and
countries like Malaysia and India have recently started utilizing the
Indian Rupee to settle some trades. In keeping with that, China and
France recently carried out a test exchange for natural gas that was
settled in Yuan. According to Alexander Bobakov, deputy chairman of the
Russian State Duma, the BRICS nations---Russia, Brazil, India, China,
and South Africa---were supposed to be working on the development of a
new currency. (Subacchi, 2023). He said this while addressing the public
outside the Russian-Indian Strategic Partnership for Development and
Growth Business Forum in New Delhi, India. Members of the bloc have made
major efforts to isolate themselves from the US-dominated international
trade and financial system. Bobakov added that the transition to
national currency settlements is the first stage. The new currency will
be based on \"other groups of products, rare-earth minerals, or soil\",
in addition to being pegged to the value of gold and not defending the
dollar or the euro. The first stage of this process, trade in national
currencies, is currently well underway. China, which has the
second-largest economy in the world, and Brazil, which has the biggest
economy in Latin America, both suggest that they would like to undertake
bilateral trade in their respective national currencies, the Chinese
Yuan (unit of Renminbi) and the Brazilian reais, rather than using the
US dollar. In addition, even while the US dollar continues to rule the
global financial system and serve as the primary reserve currency, the
use of the Yuan has increased over the past few years, accounting for 7%
of all foreign exchange trades conducted globally. It now ranks as the
third most popular payment method overall, in addition to being used as
a reserve currency. Because the US dollar is the reserve currency for
the entire globe, it functions as both a universal unit of account and
the default currency in international trade. Because of this, a major
portionof the foreign exchange assets of every central bank,
Treasury/Exchequer, and significant firm on Earth are maintained in US
dollars. (Milam, 2023). [Another important reason that has influenced
the global move away from the dollar is the application of financial
sanctions by Europe and the US following the crisis in Russia and
Ukraine. In addition to freezing Russia\'s financial assets, these
sanctions have made many nations outside the conflict zone aware of the
risks associated with a world financial system dominated by the United
States. International trade has become more unstable as a result of the
U.S.\'s rising reliance on sanctions as a weapon to manage the dollar
settlement system. As a result, [many states]{.mark} which are not
intimately related to the U.S. and Europe [are **unwilling to continue**
trading using the dollar]{.mark}.]{.underline} While these sanctions
have significantly hurt Russia\'s economy and finances, analysts at
ANBOUND believe that they will eventually have an influence on the
monetary system. In the long run, the United States\' employment of
financial sanctions and other methods to assert its power may eventually
cause the dollar\'s role as the world's reservec urrency to decline.
(Shagina, 2022).

Implications of De-dollarization for U.S. Hegemony

[One of the pillars of US global hegemony is the US dollar. [US
heg]{.mark}emony **[will no longer be stable]{.mark}** [without the
currency]{.mark}. The US currency is also vulnerable to the infamous
Thucydides trap from any possible rivals.]{.underline} With its current
set of policy instruments, the US will make every effort to preserve the
dominance of the US dollar. So, in the race for more significant
international monetary roles, prudence must be used. The US dollar
continues to rule the worldwide economic system, but [there will be an
increase in the share of local currencies used for cross-border
transactions. More regional settlement agreements will be
created]{.underline}.The positive perspective, for the American
leadership and citizens, of the hegemony of the dollar was that it
favoured the United States, its government, and most of its
citizens---at least Americans take advantage of the dollar\'s hegemony.
In the foreseeable future, it is also less likely to continue. The US
dollar will probably continue to be the dominant currency for
international trade and transactions for some time to come, but some
analysts believe that as strong economies like China and Russia
diversify their currency reserves and use alternative currencies more
frequently, the US dollar\'s hold on the world financial system may
weaken. [[This]{.mark} kind of situation ultimately [will lead to the
**eroding of U.S.**]{.mark} **[heg]{.mark}emony** in the global economic
market]{.underline}. While the Yuan and ruble are currently unable to
challenge the dollar\'s hegemony, [the ongoing de-dollarization efforts
by China and Russia have the potential to weaken the dollar\'s hold over
the long term]{.underline}. (Thiagarajan et al., 2023). Moreover, the
U.S. federal government, its state governments, and the majority of its
citizens mainly take advantage of the dollar\'s hegemony, and it is less
likely to be the dominant currency for international trade and
transactions in the long term in the future. Some analysts believe that
strong economies like China and Russia aimed to diversify their currency
reserves and use alternative currencies more frequently to weaken the US
dollar\'s hold on the world financial system. The say of the U.S. in the
international monetary system might It is also noteworthy that the Yuan
and ruble are currently unable to challenge the dollar\'s hegemony; the
ongoing de-dollarization efforts by China and Russia have the potential
to weaken the dollar\'s hold on the long-term, and this will cost to
U.S. hegemony in the world.

### AT: Heg\-\--Collapse Inevitable\-\--2NC

#### Western heg is collapsing [now]{.underline}---economic patterns are mirroring those of the [late Soviet Union]{.underline}.

Wim **Naudé '25**, Visiting Professor at RWTH Aachen University and
Fellow at the ASC University of Leiden, *Palgrave Macmillan*, "The
Economic Decline of the West: Guns, Oil, and Oligarchs," 2025,
file:///Users/abby/Downloads/978-3-031-82299-5.pdf, //AR!

Various concerns exist about how [[economic forces are contributing to
the]{.mark} possible **[collapse of the West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One
is a growing and shared concern about the nature of global neoliberal
capitalism. [The critiques of capitalism have perhaps never been as loud
in the West as they were at the time of writing this book]{.underline}.
A second concern is that the global order is shifting and that the rise
of new powers is eroding Western hegemony. These two concerns are
discussed in the rest of this subsection. Firstly as far as the
critiques of neoliberal capitalism---"capitalism on steroids" as Monbiot
and Hutchison (2024) described it---are concerned, several recent
sources critique the prevailing economic model in the West, described in
Chap. 2 of this book as a focus on continuous growth, expansion into new
frontiers for exploitation, fnancialization, and the pursuit of proft
above all else. [[There is a]{.mark} growing [realization in the West
that]{.mark} neoliberal [cap]{.mark}italism [is]{.mark} **inherently
[unsustainable]{.mark}** and is [contributing to]{.mark} a range of
economic problems, including rising [inequality]{.mark}, [declining
living standards]{.mark}, and a growing sense of
[insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Amongst the growing number of authors
who have been critical of neoliberal capitalism over the past two
decades, a representative sample would include Klein (2008), Piketty
(2014), Chomsky (2016), Harvey (2003), Wolf (2023), Zuboff (2019), Mayer
(2024), and Streeck (2016). Against these criticisms of capitalism and
forewarnings of its collapse, one could read Boldizzoni (2020), who, in
his book Foretelling the End of Capitalism: Intellectual Misadventures
since Karl Marx, speculates on the reasons why, despite the apparent
shortcomings and many predictions of its collapse, capitalism has
survived so long.

Mayer (2024) levels one of the most often heard criticisms against
capitalism, namely that [it has become too focused on short-term proft
maximization, [leading to a]{.mark} disregard for negative externalities
and a **[decline in public trust]{.mark}**]{.underline}---see also
Wautier's (2024) critical discussion of Mayer (2024) remedies for
capitalism---such as prioritizing a "higher purpose over proft" and
implementing reforms. Mayer (2024) believes that deep down neoliberal
capitalism is good and can be reformed to iron out a few creases.

Morgan (2024) warns about the increasing fnancialization of the global
economy, where fnancial activity has become detached from the production
of actual goods and services. This has resulted in a system driven by
speculation, debt, and the pursuit of ever-increasing asset values,
creating a "gigantic bubble" vulnerable to collapse (Morgan, 2024).
There seems to be a growing consensus that [**[excessive debt]{.mark}**
is a major economic problem facing the West]{.underline} (Roubini,
2022). Mounting levels of public and private debt, low interest rates,
and quantitative easing measures have created a precarious fnancial
situation that could unravel quickly.

According to Tverberg (2024a, 2024b), the heavy use of debt and leverage
in advanced economies makes them particularly susceptible to fnancial
shocks. She argues that [[the current]{.mark} "bubble of [debt]{.mark}"
[is **vulnerable to collapse**]{.mark}, potentially leading to a sharp
contraction in economic activity. In particular, in economies suffering
from a Great Stagnation, as in the West, where economic growth is
declining, higher interest rates in the presence of high debt levels can
cause a **severe economic crisis**]{.underline}. As she explains:

Raising interest rates is thus a way to intentionally slow the economy.
If the economy grows too quickly (like a 20-year-old sprinter), then
such a change makes sense. But if the economy is behaving like an
80-year-old, hobbling along on a walking stick, it becomes likely
[[the]{.mark} [economy will]{.mark} fguratively [fall]{.mark} and become
severely injured. This is the danger of raising interest rates when the
world economy is having diffculty growing at an adequate
rate]{.underline}. (Tverberg, 2024a, 2024b)

[Historian Niall [Ferguson]{.mark}, in his blog article "We're All
Soviets Now," [draws comparisons between the current]{.mark} [state of
the US and **the late Soviet Union**]{.mark}, noting similarities
[in]{.mark} terms of growing national [debt]{.mark}, political
[polarization]{.mark}, [and declining public trust]{.mark} in
institutions]{.underline}. In the Soviet Union, government defcits
persisted for decades, exceeding 5% of GDP. Similarly, in the US, the
Congressional Budget Offce projects defcits exceeding 5% of GDP for the
foreseeable future, potentially rising to 8.5% by 2054. Ferguson (2024)
[[also compares the US]{.mark}'s debt burden [to]{.mark} that of
**[Britain after World War I]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when its public
debt soared to nearly 200% of GDP. The US's current debt exceeds 124% of
GDP (Elkhawass, 2024). Ferguson (2024) [expresses concerns [that]{.mark}
rising interest rates [could]{.mark} strain the US federal budget and
[**limit its ability** to maintain global
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ferguson, 2024; Rich, 2024).

Jones (2023) [argues that [the]{.mark} economic [system in the
West]{.mark}, despite promises of freedom and prosperity, [is]{.mark}
increasingly [delivering insecurity]{.mark}, growing
[inequality]{.mark}, [and a decline in well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[He points to the erosion of secure, well-paid jobs, the weakening of
social safety nets, and rising housing and healthcare costs as key
factors **contributing to this decline**.]{.underline}

[[The Sino-American rivalry]{.mark} thus [becomes]{.mark} the archetypal
form of [a]{.mark} great [expansive power **confronted**]{.mark} [by
a]{.mark} great [autonomous power]{.mark}, of a great

[versus a]{.mark} [pacifist]{.mark} great power focusing on commercial

change]{.mark}: [China]{.mark}, whose global status is tarnished, **[may
react]{.mark} [violently]{.mark}** [to any blockade of **its peaceful

The specificity of China's social formation is a matter of deep

[contribute]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the emergence of [a community of
civilizations]{.mark} genuinely [respectful of cultural
differences]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Arrighi foresaw. However, to
achieve this, it must provide a radically different response, in favor
of the Global South, to the polarized structure of wealth and power that
characterized historical capitalism. [[A global market]{.mark} society

### AT: Heg\-\--Deterrence Fails\-\--2NC

#### Deterrence [fails]{.underline}\-\--diminishing [marginal returns]{.underline} and excess [spending]{.underline} creates conflict.

unsustainable." Mises Institute's Mises Wire, August 5, 2024.

For nearly [**two centuries** the United States has been an
**expansionist power**]{.underline}. Though it was the War of 1812 when
the U.S. solidified its dominion over the Americas, it was at the
twilight of the Spanish-American War when the American Empire finally
came of age. The first two decades of the [**20th century** marked
America's transition]{.underline} --- [for better or worse]{.underline}
--- [into a **global superpower**]{.underline}.

By the end of the First World War, the United States had solidified
itself as an emerging global power until finally asserting itself as the
world's dominant ascendancy in the aftermath of World War II. From 1945
and over the course of the next fifty years, [the U.S.'s **s**phere
**o**f **i**nfluence would continue to expand its **global network** of
military **installations**]{.underline} in order to curtail Soviet
influence. Now, nearly three decades following the USSR's collapse,
[there are still **[800]{.mark} formal U.S. [bases]{.mark}** [across
**eighty countries**]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}. [Not only is this
unacceptable, but it [is]{.mark} also **[needlessly
wasteful]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2001, [close to **[\$6
trillion]{.mark}** has been [spent on wars]{.mark} in Syria, Iraq,
Afghanistan and Pakistan alone]{.underline}. The utility of the empire's
[foreign military infrastructure [is]{.mark} simply [**not worth** the
cost required to sustain it]{.mark}]{.underline}; therefore, the number
of bases worldwide should be strategically reduced to only those
[installations that are essential to **defending** the homeland and
protecting **international commerce**]{.underline}.

Though the USSR no longer threatens liberal hegemony, [U.S. foreign
policy is **still rooted** in a Cold War mindset]{.underline}. While an
official plan for base realignment and closure was presented in the
1990s under President Bill Clinton, [only a **select few** installations
were shut down]{.underline}; [most were simply **repurposed** and
assigned to deter other **perceived threats** to U.S.
primacy]{.underline}. However, very few of these installations actually
do much to help secure the homeland. In fact, this was not even their
original intended purpose! [They were designed to **defend liberal
hegemony**, which is **no longer** the centralized bloc it once
was]{.underline}. While American primacy may have made logical sense in
the post-war era, in order to halt the spread of communism (although
that too has been subject to debate), [there is no longer any
**practical need** for the extent of its power to be so
expansive]{.underline}.

Today, the single [[**largest** concentration of]{.mark} U.S. foreign
[bases is]{.mark} located within the **[eurozone]{.mark}**, where there
exist roughly **[300]{.mark} military
[installations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 1942 the U.S. has
maintained a permanent presence in Europe and, after the Second World
War, played a significant role in stabilizing the continent, which would
go on to serve as the key focal point for NATO. Since then, the EU has
become incredibly self-sufficient; [the [combined]{.mark} European armed
[forces]{.mark} and nuclear arsenals [are]{.mark} **more than
[capable]{.mark}** [of deterring]{.mark} potential threats [**without**
the]{.mark} need for [U.S.]{.mark} **assistance**]{.underline}. Every
major European nation is wealthy enough to afford its own defense. [It
is therefore **strategically useless** for the U.S. to maintain such a
gargantuan military presence in the EU]{.underline}, whose members are
already among America's closest allies.

[Having more military bases does not **automatically** create more
deterrence]{.underline}. The U.S. currently has several dozen forward
operating bases in the Middle East, hundreds of smaller outposts, and a
combined garrison of over 30,000 military personnel. If deterrence were
a certainty, then a force of that magnitude would be able to ensure
stability in the region. [Having [more soldiers]{.mark} does not equate
to more stability; more likely is that [there is a **maximum threshold**
of **marginal utility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Depending on how one
chooses to define a "military installation," [the U.S. currently has
somewhere between four and nine bases in **Iraq**]{.underline}. In a
country that size, having, say, seven bases and nine thousand soldiers
is no more effective than having only three bases and three thousand
soldiers. [The U.S. armed forces possess a far greater **technological
advantage** over other militaries as well]{.underline}. This means that
fewer soldiers are thus required for an occupation to be successful.
Regarding defense of the homeland, a high-tech defense system would be
enough to deter potential aggressors; bases and outposts on islands
throughout the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans would be the only
foreign installations needed in order to supplement that.

While [the **purpose** of military occupation is to produce
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such [endeavors]{.mark} often
[have the **exact opposite effect**]{.mark} in contrast to the
**intended result**]{.underline}. It often makes a population more wary
and resentful toward the occupying force. [Attempts to exhort hegemony
have **undermined** the sovereignty of some countries]{.underline},
resulting in the rise of reactionary elements that oppose Western
influence. [The **[rise of ISIS]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, was
something that [[happened]{.mark} largely [in **response** to]{.mark}
the invasion of [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, [[Russia
expanded into]{.mark} **Georgia** and **[Ukraine]{.mark}** partially [in
**retaliation to NATO**]{.mark} expansion]{.underline}.

As of 2024, [the **national [debt]{.mark}** [sits at]{.mark} nearly
**[\$35 trillion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The military budget accounts
for close to 15% of all U.S. federal spending]{.underline}, and since
2016, over \$600 billion has been spent every year on "national defense"
alone, making it the largest of all discretionary budgets at nearly 50%.
Up to \$120 billion of this is spent on the upkeep of foreign bases, and
an additional \$70 billion on contingency operations. Even [[if]{.mark}
**just [half]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} all [nonessential]{.mark} U.S.
[bases]{.mark} were [closed]{.mark}, the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [would save **billions**]{.mark} **of
dollars**]{.underline} --- [money that would better be allocated [toward
paying]{.mark} off the **national debt**, a third of which is owned by
**[foreign entities]{.mark}** such as **China**]{.underline}. If America
cannot afford to sustain its own military, then there is no reason for
her military to be that large. [**Unrestrained militarism** and high
levels of **deficit spending** have contributed to the **demise** of
countless great powers throughout history]{.underline}. Having a
military is important, but it is also important that the U.S. only
finance what it can afford; this requires relegating spending to focus
on funding only the essentials. The simplest way to start would be by
closing foreign bases that are of no importance to national defense.

### AT: Heg\-\--Militarism Fails\-\--2NC

#### Militarism is [self-defeating]{.underline}\-\--[financialization]{.underline}, [inefficiencies]{.underline}, and [unproductive spending]{.underline}.

Permanent War Economy." Stimson Center, December 2, 2024.
https://www.stimson.org/2024/the-ugly-truth-about-the-permanent-war-economy/.

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} may have
managed to [**avoid strategic** and **budgetary** tradeoffs at the peak
of its power, but the United States [**cannot maintain** the]{.mark}
**[s]{.mark}**tatus **[quo]{.mark}** forever]{.underline}. [An
increasingly **multipolar world** requires tradeoffs]{.underline}.26 In
fact, some analysts have already declared strategic insolvency, urging
the United States to abandon the [**[Cold War mindset]{.mark}** of
maintaining U.S. military dominance in all parts of the
globe]{.underline}.27 [This mindset will [further **cement**]{.mark}
**itself** in DC if the United States hikes national **security
[spending]{.mark}** and loosens the weapon acquisition
process]{.underline}.

[**Financial Health** of the Arms Industry]{.underline}

Much of [**Washington** operates as though the United States can hold
onto the **unipolar moment forever**]{.underline}, if only the Pentagon
has enough money and power. In so doing, [Washington insiders **do not
seriously interrogate** the viability of fulfilling U.S. strategic
aspirations with more Pentagon spending]{.underline}. [Nor does the
national security establishment grapple with the negative consequences
of a bloated Pentagon budget]{.underline}. As a result, [Washington
discounts the fundamental nature of the defense industry]{.underline}.

[Military contractor executives **maximize financial returns**, not
production **capacity** or **efficiency**]{.underline}. According to a
2023 Pentagon study on contract finance, military contractors increased
cash paid to shareholders by 73% from the first decade of this century
to 2010-2019.28 [Contractors **inflated shareholder returns** by
significantly reducing spending on capital **investments** and internal
**research** and development, even given increased profit margins and
cash flow over the same period]{.underline}.29

Despite this track record, the NDIS suggests that increased Pentagon
spending will enable contractors to make "longer-term production and
resource allocation commitments" to capital investment, research and
development, and manufacturing capacity.30 [But security
[spending]{.mark} has **steadily [grown]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
**decades**, and research clearly shows that for the first **[twenty
years]{.mark}** of this century, [contractors]{.mark}
**[prioritize]{.mark}**d [payments to shareholders at]{.mark} the
[**expense** of]{.mark} **investments** in their
businesses]{.underline}.31

It's true that [the arms industry relies on government demand for its
products and services]{.underline}. [Contractors are **unlikely** to
make [**long-term** investments]{.mark} without government
contracts]{.underline}, but not necessarily because they cannot afford
to. The industry is financially healthy and improving.32 In fact,
researchers who contributed to the 2023 Pentagon study found that
publicly traded U.S. military contractors "generate substantial amounts
of cash beyond their needs for operations or capital investment," noting
that "the bulk is returned to shareholders."33

Defense industry leaders spend their money on shareholders while reaping
the financial returns of government investments in their businesses.34
Indeed, the government often reimburses contractors for capital
investments and internal research and development spending.35 Still,
contractors have claimed that that profitability is insufficient to
finance investments.36 The Pentagon questioned this claim in its study.
Researchers pointed out that while defense firms' profit margins may be
lower than commercial counterparts, they lag behind the defense industry
in most other financial metrics.37

The Pentagon study argues that these metrics, including higher returns
on invested capital, are much better indicators of the arms industry's
financial health than profitability. Another metric is total return to
shareholders. From 2000 to 2019, defense firms' annual total return to
shareholders significantly exceeded that of their commercial
counterparts -- at some points, by as much as ten or eleven percentage
points.38

The Reality of Financialization

Contractors' priorities are clear, and they are unlikely to change with
a cash infusion. In this regard, [the defense industry may exemplify the
most damaging impacts of financialization]{.underline}.39 Sometimes
referred to as shareholder capitalism, financialization is best
described by its founding father, Milton Friedman. In 1970, he wrote
that the primary responsibility of a corporate executive is "to conduct
the business in accordance with \[shareholders'\] desires, which
generally will be to make as much money as possible."40 Financialization
accelerated in the years that followed, but it did not start there.

Industrial production capacity deteriorated after World War II as
business school-educated managers infiltrated factories, prioritizing
investments in new industries, products, and manufacturing facilities.
They acquired subsidiaries to dress up their books, inflating quarterly
earnings reports by running down subsidiaries' equipment and claiming
losses. In the process, corporate managers reduced their tax liability
and increased profits at the expense of building production capacity.41
This history is essential to understanding the state of U.S.
manufacturing today.

The impacts of financialization are particularly egregious in the
defense industry because it would not exist without the government. The
largest U.S. military contractor, [**Lockheed Martin**, generated 73% of
its consolidated net sales from U.S. **government contracts** in
2023]{.underline}. The F-35 program alone accounted for 26%.42 Yet due
to industry consolidation, [defense contractors have **significant
leverage** against the government due to its limited
options]{.underline}.

A larger Pentagon budget may boost weapon production. However,
[[**trillions** of]{.mark} dollars in additional military
[spending]{.mark} is [unlikely]{.mark} to [yield]{.mark} a
[**proportional increase** in]{.mark} **military [industrial]{.mark}**
[output]{.mark}]{.underline}. If history is any indication, military
[[contractors]{.mark} will dedicate an **outsized portion** of that
money to [maximize cash]{.mark} paid [to **shareholders**]{.mark},
[not]{.mark} to [increase **production**]{.mark} **capacity** or
**efficiency**]{.underline}. Moreover, such investment in the military
may be more damaging to the U.S. economy in the long term than it is
useful in fighting wars that will hopefully never happen.

The Economic Consequences of Higher Spending

As RAND analysts note, [supporters of Pentagon budget increases **don't
typically see tradeoffs** between security **spending** and economic
**growth**]{.underline}.43 This may be partly attributed to the economic
legacy of the Second World War, which impressed upon Americans the
notion that military spending bolsters the economy. Indeed, history
credits World War II spending with lifting the United States out of the
Great Depression.44 In reality, any substantial level of government
spending stimulates economic growth. And while U.S. industrial
mobilization was critical to the Allied victory, [the decision to
mobilize for war was a **serious one** with **negative consequences**
for generations of Americans]{.underline}.

In his most recent book, the economist [Alexander Field argues that
**industrial mobilization** for the second World War]{.underline}
~~retarded~~ \[**[damaged]{.underline}**\] [potential U.S. economic
growth long-term]{.underline}.45 [He bases his argument, in part, on the
decline in manufacturing **productivity**, or output per unit of
input]{.underline}. Production output drastically increased during the
war, but manufacturing productivity never fully recovered to its pre-war
growth rate.46 Indeed, the rate of productivity growth from 1919 to 1941
significantly outpaced that from 1948 to 1973, what is generally
considered to be the end of the post-war boom period.47

Field's work is significant because it [**challenges** the popular
notion that the United States experienced a "**productivity miracle**"
due to wartime industrial mobilization]{.underline}.48 In so doing, he
disputes the broader belief that military spending ultimately
strengthens the economy by boosting long term economic growth. According
to Field, "[the consumer sector experienced **limited beneficial
spillovers** from the wartime experience of mass-producing military
goods]{.underline}." Indeed, [industrial [mobilization]{.mark} for the
war]{.underline} "[[**distorted** capital accumulation]{.mark},
**crowding out investment** [in sectors]{.mark} of the economy [not
critical for the **military**]{.mark} **effort**]{.underline}."49
Workers developed new skills through their wartime learning experiences,
but there was little opportunity to leverage those skills in the
post-war economy.50

Industrial mobilization for World War II was not the boon to the economy
romanticized by many historians. The United States managed to increase
military industrial output in a short period of time, but doing so
ultimately hampered U.S. economic prospects because the United States
had little use for weapon production facilities after the war ended.51
Yet the sheer scale of war spending and the country's subsequent ascent
to superpower status had such a profound impact on society that, 80
years later, mainstream discourse about military spending remains
relatively unchanged from what it was in the early post-war era.

Unproductive Investment

Officials in [Washington frame military spending as a **jobs program**
strengthening the economy]{.underline}, in part by promoting U.S.
manufacturing.52 But such claims cannot explain the deterioration of
U.S. manufacturing in the past several decades, when military spending
was high. [**Other industries** far outpace defense in jobs
creation]{.underline}.53 There is even evidence that suggests a positive
relationship between poverty and local economies' dependency on the arms
industry, though more research is needed to evaluate this interaction.54
Globally, [research suggests that military spending **depresses
long-term economic growth** in most countries]{.underline}.55 This trend
can be at least partly attributed to the unproductive nature of military
spending, a long-established concept.

Adam Smith explained the military's drain on the economy in his seminal
text on economic theory published in 1776, The Wealth of Nations. He
wrote that the military establishment produces nothing of value in
peacetime, and in wartime it acquires "nothing which can compensate the
expense of maintaining \[it\], even while the war lasts."56 Put another
way, civilians cannot consume weapons or produce anything with them.
They are useless in the economy.

The intrinsic unproductivity of national security spending requires the
United States to ruthlessly prioritize its acquisition needs. In so
doing, the United States is likely to address many of the acquisition
challenges it currently faces, including schedule slippages and cost
overruns. [These issues are likely to worsen with higher national
security spending, a looser acquisition process, and a bigger defense
industrial base]{.underline} because they will encourage superfluous
weapon development. [The **U**nited **S**tates is [better off **making
tradeoffs**]{.mark} today [than]{.mark} it is **[demobilizing]{.mark}**
in [the future]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Economic Conversion

As Ethan Kapstein writes in The Political Economy of National Security,
the United States spent millions of dollars converting weapon production
facilities to civilian use after World War II. U.S. workers dedicated
thousands of labor hours to the effort, and the conversion process was
still underway when the Korean war began. 57 Economic conversion is
incredibly costly and time intensive, and the United States should avoid
adding to the burden as much as possible.

The industrial engineer, economist, and peace activist Seymour Melman
dedicated much of his career to the task of economic conversion. Like
Smith, he argued that investing in unnecessary weapon production harms
the economy. This idea is central to Melman's argument against what he
[characterizes as **[parasitic]{.mark} growth** of the [Pentagon]{.mark}
budget]{.underline}. Parasitic budget [growth [**rapidly depletes**
resources]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} it **[does
n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o[**[t]{.mark}** [contribute to
**taxpayer**]{.mark}s' **[q]{.mark}**uality **[o]{.mark}**f
**[l]{.mark}**ife]{.underline}.58 Most often, [it does not increase
**potential** future production]{.underline}, either. Productive growth
in other industries achieves one or both these ends.

Melman warned that if [**parasitic [growth]{.mark}** of the Pentagon
budget continued, the **U**nited **S**tates would eventually [reach a
**point of no return**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the point of no return,
[**[production]{.mark} competence** [and]{.mark}
**[productivity]{.mark}** in the United States [would **decay**]{.mark}
to a degree **[impossible to reverse]{.mark}**]{.underline} without a
wholesale reorientation of the U.S. economy. This shift would require
the United States to make a "firm ideological commitment" to industrial
and economic renewal, which necessarily involves significant divestment
from the permanent war economy. 59

Divestment would require Washington to look toward the future and
abandon tired, misguided narratives about the role of military spending
in the economy. [The reality is that a **military buildup** would
**catapult** the United States toward Melman's point of no
return]{.underline}. [**[Generations]{.mark}** of Americans [would
pay]{.mark} for **[trillions]{.mark}** of dollars [in]{.mark} excessive
national security spending through their **[tax]{.mark} dollars**, but
also in potential **[jobs]{.mark}**, **[infrastructure]{.mark}**,
**[productivity]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} thus, **[econ]{.mark}omic
[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Now is the time to make the shift toward
economic renewal, for posterity's sake.

Conclusion

The United States is unlikely to fight a war at home, and a potential
great power conflict abroad would likely be a choice rather than an
inevitability. Yet Washington demands that Americans make a generational
investment in the military without naming the costs or identifying the
conditions in which the United States would decrease security spending
in the future. Arms industry spokespeople and government officials
promote a military buildup in the name of great power competition, but
they neglect to define its contours -- or make a compelling case for how
it advances core national interests.60

At this moment, [inflating the Pentagon budget appears to be an end
itself rather than a means to building an effective national
defense]{.underline}. [The military is not]{.underline}, in fact, [the
**best** or the **only way** for the United States to address national
security threats]{.underline}. So as decisionmakers digest proposals to
increase national security spending, expand the defense industrial base,
and loosen weapon acquisition, they should consider the strategic and
fiscal challenges that might face their successors in thirty years.

In 2024, interest payments on the debt will exceed the Pentagon base
budget for the first time.61 In the next decade, personnel and weapon
sustainment costs will exceed the rate of inflation -- accounting for
nearly 70% of Pentagon budget growth.62 [These [problems]{.mark} will
only **[compound]{.mark} with time**, with future [generations forced to
shoulder the]{.mark} **economic [burden]{.mark}** if the United States
does not **change course**]{.underline}.

#### Innovation solves oil spills now.

**Cook '25** \[Jessica; 05/12/2025; Arctic Council Secretariat; A NEW
TOOL TO AID OIL SPILL CLEAN UPS ON ARCTIC SHORELINES,
https://arctic-council.org/news/a-new-tool-to-aid-oil-spill-clean-ups-on-arctic-shorelines/;
akshaj\]

As [activity in the Arctic increases]{.underline}, [so does the risk of
oil spills]{.underline}. To [[improve oil spill response in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [Arctic Council]{.underline}'s
Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response (EPPR) Working Group
[launched]{.underline} the Circumpolar Oil Spill Response Viability
Analysis (**[[COSRVA]{.underline}]{.mark}**).

The COSRVA has been an important [[project]{.underline}]{.mark} for EPPR
to [better [understand]{.mark}]{.underline} the [potential]{.underline}
for different [oil spill [response]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}
to [operate in the Arctic]{.underline} marine environment. Now, EPPR is
adding a **[[shoreline remediation]{.underline}]{.mark}** component to
the tool -- the Shoreline COSRVA, or S-COSRVA for short.

How does the tool work and who can find it most useful? Two experts
involved with its development, Synnøve Lunde, Senior Advisor at the
Norwegian Coastal Administration and Odd Willy Brude, Senior Principal
Consultant at DNV, explain in this Q&A.

What special considerations are there for oil spills on shorelines?

Synnøve Lunde: Shorelines can vary a lot in the substances and
characteristics that it's made up of. There are various types of stone,
sand, vegetation, as well as differing terrain that may be steep or
flat. Shorelines may be shallow or deep. There are some that can only be
reached from the sea or only from land. [Shorelines may be close to or
far from infrastructure and communities]{.underline}. This will vary a
lot [[throughout the **circumpolar Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Shoreline cleanup is very time consuming and also a challenge because
oil might hide between stones or in the vegetation.

What is the S-COSRVA, and why is there a need for it?

Synnøve Lunde: In the event of an oil spill, the
**[[S-COSRVA]{.underline}]{.mark}** is meant to [guide]{.underline} the
user in finding the [best]{.underline} [equipment and
system]{.underline} for the shoreline that's affected. The tool
[includes]{.underline} 22 accepted and [commonly]{.underline} [[used
shoreline treatment options]{.underline}]{.mark} that it
[[analyzes]{.underline}]{.mark} with respect to [feasibility based on
environmental [factors]{.mark} of a particular location]{.underline}. It
was developed for EPPR by DNV and Owens Coastal Consulting.

The purpose of the S-COSRVA project is to [better [understand the
**viability** and **feasibility**]{.mark} for different oil spill
response options]{.underline} for various Arctic coastal environments
and shorelines. By having this tool, the [user]{.underline} can become
[familiarized with the shoreline in the area]{.underline} of
responsibility and more quickly [[find]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[right]{.underline}]{.mark} clean up [[method]{.underline}]{.mark}
based on its unique characteristics.

Odd Willy Brude: The S-COSRVA is meant as a planning and decision
support tool. It involves five separate analyses and outputs:

Feasibility Analysis for Shoreline Treatment
(**[[FAST]{.underline}]{.mark}**): feasible treatment options [[based on
shore type and oil type scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark}

Remote Viability Analysis (**[[RVA]{.underline}]{.mark}**): [logistics
and [deployment]{.mark} viability [from]{.mark} support [centers]{.mark}
to coastal locations]{.underline}

Operational Systems Viability Analysis
(**[[OSVA]{.underline}]{.mark}**): [favorability of environmental
[parameters]{.mark} for operational systems [for shoreline
cleanup]{.mark}]{.underline}

Coastal Deployment Viability Analysis (**[[CDVA]{.underline}]{.mark}**):
[environmental constraints to [deploy operations support]{.mark} to a
coastal [location]{.mark}]{.underline}

Shoreline Access Viability Analysis (**[[SAVA]{.underline}]{.mark}**):
[access and deployment favorability/constraints to a shoreline
location]{.underline}

The [outputs]{.underline} from each of these analyses [[create a
**science-based rationale**]{.underline}]{.mark} for planners and
decision-makers that [[includes]{.mark} [considerations of]{.mark} the
[consequences and tradeoffs]{.mark} associated]{.underline} with [oil
spill cleanup]{.underline} and [treatment options.]{.underline}

JUNE 5, 2015 \-- Would you look at crude oil and think, \"Mmm,
tasty\...\"? Probably not.

But if you were a microbe living in the ocean you might have a different
answer.

There are [[species of marine bacteria]{.mark} in several
families]{.underline}, including Marinobacter, Oceanospiralles,
Pseudomonas, and Alkanivorax, [that [can **eat compounds** from
petroleum]{.mark}]{.underline} as part of their diet. In fact, there are
at least seven species of bacteria that can survive solely on oil \[1\].

These [bacteria [are **nature\'s way of removing oil**]{.mark} that ends
up in the ocean]{.underline}, [whether]{.underline} the oil is there
[because of oil spills or natural oil seeps]{.underline}. Those of us in
the oil spill response community [call this biological process of
removing oil \"biodegradation.\"]{.underline}

What Whets Their Oily Appetites?

[[Communities]{.mark} of oil-eating bacteria [are **naturally
present**]{.mark} throughout the world\'s oceans]{.underline},
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [places as different as the warm waters of the
Persian Gulf]{.underline} \[2\] [and [the **Arctic**
]{.mark}**conditions** of the Chukchi Sea north of Alaska]{.underline}
\[3\].

[E[ach community]{.underline}]{.mark} [of bacteria is **[specially
adapted]{.mark}** for the environment where it is living,]{.underline}
and studies have found that [bacteria consume oil most
quickly]{.underline} when they are kept [in conditions similar to their
natural environments]{.underline} \[4\]. So that means that if you took
Arctic bacteria and brought them to an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
they would not eat the oil as quickly as the bacteria that are already
living in the Gulf. You would get the same result in the reverse case,
with the Arctic bacteria beating out the Gulf bacteria at an oil spill
in Alaska.

Other factors that affect how quickly bacteria degrade oil include the
amount of oxygen and nutrients in the water, the temperature of the
water, the surface area of the oil, and the kind of oil that they are
eating \[4\]\[5\]\[6\]. That means the bacteria that live in a given
area will consume the oil from a spill in the summer more quickly than a
spill in the winter, and will eat light petroleum products such as
gasoline or diesel much more quickly than heavy petroleum products like
fuel oil or heavy crude oil.

This [bacteria]{.underline}, fluorescing under ultraviolet light in a

Asphalt, the very heaviest component of crude oil, is actually so
difficult for bacteria to eat that we can use it to pave our roads
without worrying about the road rotting away.

What About During Oil Spills?

People are often interested in the possibility of using bacteria to help
clean up oil spills, and [[**most oil** left in the ocean]{.mark} long
enough is **[consumed by bacteri]{.mark}a**]{.underline}.

However, most [oil [spills last only a few
days]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and during that time [[other]{.mark}
[natural]{.mark} \"weathering\" [processes]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as
[[evaporation]{.mark} and [wave-induced breakup]{.mark}]{.underline} [of
the oil]{.underline}, [[have a much bigger effect]{.underline}]{.mark}
on the appearance and location of the oil than bacteria do. This is
because there are usually only a small number of oil-eating bacteria in
any given part of the ocean, and it [takes a few days]{.underline} for
their population to increase to take advantage of their abundant new
food source.

Because of this lag time, biodegradation was not originally included in
NOAA\'s oil weathering software ADIOS. ADIOS is a computer model
designed to help oil spill responders by predicting how much of the oil
will stay in the ocean during the first five days of a spill.

However, oil spills like the 2010 [Deepwater Horizon well
blowout,]{.underline} which released oil for about three months,
[demonstrate that there is a need]{.underline} for a model that can tell
us what would happen to the oil over longer periods of time. My team in
the Emergency Response Division at NOAA\'s Office of Response and
Restoration has recognized that. As a result, version 3 of ADIOS, due to
be released later in 2015, will take into account biodegradation.

My team and I used data published in scientific journals on the speed of
oil biodegradation under different conditions to develop an equation
that can predict how fast the components of oil will be consumed, and
how the speed of this process can change based on the surface
area-to-mass ratio of the oil and the climate it is in. A report
describing the technical details of the model will be published in the
upcoming Proceedings of the Arctic and Marine Oilspill Program(link is
external) Technical Seminar, which will be released after the June
conference.

Including oil biodegradation in our ADIOS software will provide oil
spill responders with an even better tool to help them make decisions
about their options during a response. As part of the team working on
this project, it has provided me with a much greater appreciation for
the [**[important role]{.mark}** that [oil-eating bacteria play in the
**long-term effort**]{.mark} to keep our oceans free of
oil.]{.underline}

I know I\'m [certainly glad they think oil is delicious.]{.underline}

He expected the drone attack to "[likely to be the [beginning of]{.mark}
a [larger]{.mark}]{.underline}, more layered
[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark} where Tehran may attempt to prove quantity
can have a quality of its own."

Defense expert and retired Lebanese armed forces general Naji Mlaeb told
Breaking Defense that Israel opened "hellfire upon itself," by this
attack. And yet he seems to believe that the
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[end up]{.underline}]{.mark}
relatively **[[isolated]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"Today we are facing a very dangerous [[situation]{.underline}]{.mark},
but it is [[confined between Israel and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} and [I
[don't]{.mark}]{.underline} [[expect it to]{.mark} **[escalate]{.mark}**
for [the entire region]{.mark}]{.underline}," he added.

Retired Lebanese armed forces general Wehbe Katicha agreed, highlighting
that it is [[not in Iran's interest to escalate]{.mark} and attack US
military bases in the region]{.underline}, as such a move would [[likely
**draw** the US into the conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"I don't think the war will include other countries of the region. The
confrontation is between Iran and Israel," Katicha said. "[[Iran has
no]{.mark} [interest in targeting the US]{.mark} army]{.underline}. I
[[don't think it will expand]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather, I think it
will be a confrontation between Israel and Iran, especially with
[[Iran's **limited capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}," he told
Breaking Defense.

However, Paul Salem, Middle East Institute senior fellow, was less
sanguine about the risks.

"Yes, I do think like an all war \[is possible\]," he said. "One big
element is unpredictability and uncertainty, so no matter what .... we
have \[the\] factor in the unknown and uncertainty for sure."

Iran's semi-official press agency Tasnim, reported that the general
staff of Iranian armed forces said "there remains no limit to the scope
of Iran's response to the Zionist regime which has crossed all redlines
by attacking the Islamic Republic," a stance that would seem to open the
posibility of attacks elsewhere in the region.

Already, other countries have had to react to the conflict. Iraq and
Jordan closed their airspace, and Jordanian air defenses reportedly
intercepted incoming Iranian munitions that Jordan said were a risk to
land in its territory. (In the last exchange between Israel and Iran in
2024, Jordan played a notable part in intercepting Tehran's weapons.)

"Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace,
reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any
conflict," government spokesperson Mohammad Momani reportedly said.

All the experts agreed that attacks on the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries were unlikely.

"The GCC isn't the weak link within the regional security structure, and
Iran understands that very well," Bahrain-based strategic expert and
political researcher Abdullah Al Junaid told Breaking Defense.

"The GCC security apparatus will definitely be a high alert, and Iran
would rather keep it between the two foes instead of a wider conflict,"
he said highlighting that these states "will not tolerate any
infringement on its sovereignty by any warning parties."

Ben Taleblu noted that Gulf states are [[looking
for]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[de-escalation]{.mark}** and
de-confliction]{.underline} to [make sure]{.underline} the [[conflict
does not **spill** onto their own soil]{.underline}]{.mark}, much

[has been **constrained**]{.mark}]{.underline}, reactive and shaped by a
[growing [sense of **vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While it has
launched [retaliatory [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}, these have been
more [[limited]{.mark} in intensity and scope]{.underline} than many
would have anticipated, given Tehran's massive stockpile of ballistic
missiles and drones. This [[restraint]{.mark} is believed to [stem
from]{.mark} both [operational losses and a broader concern that
escalating]{.mark} beyond a certain [threshold]{.mark} could
[trigger]{.mark} U.S. military [involvement]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Far from]{.mark} controlling the pace of
**[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Tehran is [navigating a conflict
not of its choosing]{.underline}, with few favorable options. Its
leadership is increasingly under pressure to demonstrate resilience in
the face of heavy civilian and military losses, all while avoiding
strategic missteps that could spiral into a war it cannot sustain. The
logic guiding its actions is not one of dominance, but of survival,
i.e., preserving enough capacity and [[credibility]{.mark} to [deter
further]{.mark} Israeli [escalation]{.mark} and American intervention,
[contain]{.mark} domestic [fallout]{.mark}, and leave room for a
possible diplomatic exit]{.underline}.

Deterrence Through Phased Response

Between June 13-16, Iran reportedly launched 11 waves of retaliatory
strikes, deploying over 370 ballistic missiles and more than 100 drones.
Yet these salvos were phased, limited and tactically constrained. This
was not necessarily by choice, but a consequence of [damaged
infrastructure and the [recognition that broader escalation carries
**existential risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Iranian [analysts
acknowledge that [Tehran is holding back]{.mark} out of
necessity]{.underline}, not merely strategic calculation. Israeli
strikes appear to have rendered some major Iranian underground missile
bases in the western parts of the [[country inaccessible or
inoperable]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, Israel's effective dominance
over [[Iranian airspace makes any missile deployment **risky and
complex**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

At the same time, some experts within Iran argue that the Islamic
Republic is [[conserving]{.mark} its [capacity not in anticipation of
gaining leverage]{.mark}]{.underline}, but because it [[cannot afford
**rapid depletion**]{.mark} while the prospect of a U.S. strike remains
on the table]{.underline}. In other words, it must keep a stockpile on
hand to threaten U.S. military installations and other interests in the
region.

This interpretation is reinforced by statements from officials such as
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who noted that "only one phone call
from Washington can stop" Israeli aggression, suggesting that Tehran
still views diplomatic [[deconfliction channels]{.mark} with the U.S. as
[viable]{.mark}, even amid active conflict]{.underline}.

[Operational [restraint]{.mark} also [applies to escalation]{.mark}
boundaries]{.underline}. [Iran has [**avoided** directly targeting
U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} regional assets, though it has permitted
affiliated actors like the Houthis to conduct joint operations against
Israeli infrastructure. Reports of Iranian drones reaching Eilat and
missiles striking Haifa highlight the reach of Iran's retaliatory
capacity, while still [[stopping short]{.mark} of actions likely to
trigger American intervention]{.underline}.

This posture is not purely reactive. Tehran appears to be playing for
time, keeping Israel engaged in a war of attrition while deliberately
delaying any escalation that might transform the scale of the conflict.
The appearance of new weapons systems, such as jet-powered Shahed-107
drones and 1.5-ton warheads used in recent strikes on Tel Aviv, suggests
that [Iran]{.underline} still [possesses]{.underline} significant
[offensive capabilities]{.underline}, but is metering their use [[in
line with broader **strategic considerations**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Iran War\-\--No Escalation\-\--1NC

#### Iran doesn't want war **-- they are defensive realists**

Times **Tehran 25**, The Tehran Times is a state-affiliated source and
reflects the Iranian government's perspectives, 7/19/25, "Iran never
desires war but remains 'prepared' as truce is 'fragile': Araghchi,"
https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/515802/Iran-never-desires-war-but-remains-prepared-as-truce-is-fragile,
Troh

Speaking to China's CGTN, Araghchi reaffirmed Tehran's right to
self-defense in response to Israeli aggression and underscored that
**[[diplomacy remains the only viable path forward for resolving
tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** over Iran's nuclear program.

He stressed that [[the confrontation was not a mutual conflict but a
one-sided assault]{.underline}]{.mark}, and warned that Israel's track
record makes any truce inherently unreliable.

"We stood firm on our own soil, defended our country with courage, and
ultimately forced the aggressors to halt their operations and request an
unconditional ceasefire --- which we accepted."

"We are fully aware that no ceasefire involving that the Zionist regime
can be relied upon, given its track record. That's why we remain
vigilant and ready to respond if it is violated." He reiterated that
**[[Iran had no desire for war.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"[[We didn't start this conflict, and we don't wish for it to
continue]{.underline}]{.mark} --- but we are fully prepared for any
scenario."

'**[[Iran waiting for real U.S. commitment to
diplomacy']{.underline}]{.mark}**

When asked about Iran's hesitation to resume nuclear talks with the
United States, Araghchi explained that **[[Tehran is waiting to see
genuine political will from Washington.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"We are still evaluating the situation because we need to see real
commitment --- not just words --- from the U.S. We need to know they are
serious about a win-win solution. [[Our nuclear program is strictly
peaceful]{.underline}]{.mark}, and we are fully confident in that.
[[We're also ready to share that confidence with others, but only
through meaningful negotiations."]{.underline}]{.mark}

He pointed to the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA), as a historic diplomatic achievement.

"We successfully reached an agreement with the P5+1 in 2015. It was
celebrated worldwide as a major diplomatic success, and we upheld our
commitments. But the U.S. unilaterally withdrew --- a deeply regrettable
move. What we're witnessing now is a direct consequence of that
decision."

'**[[Diplomacy is the only path forward']{.underline}]{.mark}**

Araghchi expressed cautious optimism about reviving the nuclear deal,
but only if Washington abandons its military approach.

"[[There is still a chance for a negotiated agreement --- but only if
the other side shows real intent]{.underline}]{.mark}. The military
option must be completely off the table. We need to move forward through
diplomacy."

He stressed that [[the recent Israeli-American strike on Iranian nuclear
facilities proved the futility of military
solutions.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"Their attack clearly demonstrated that a military approach cannot
dismantle Iran's nuclear program. **[[Only a diplomatic resolution will
work]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- and that depends on them ending their
militaristic policies and compensating Iran for the damage. Only then
will we be ready to re-engage in negotiations."

'SCO is a platform for global south empowerment'

Turning to regional alliances, Araghchi praised Iran's full membership
in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), saying it reflects
Tehran's commitment to building new international partnerships outside
of Western-dominated frameworks.

"We attach great value to the SCO. It offers a platform for countries of
the Global South to claim their rightful place in the international
order."

He noted the increasing interest of other countries in joining the
organization, describing it as a positive trend driven by a shared
vision for addressing security, economic, and cultural challenges
differently from the West.

"We are grateful to the SCO Secretariat and all member states who
condemned the aggression by Israel and the United States, particularly
the attack on our nuclear infrastructure."

'Strikes on nuclear sites a violation of international law'

Finally, [[Araghchi condemned the targeting of nuclear facilities as a
grave breach of international law and a threat to
humanity.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"[Any form of military aggression violates international law and the UN
Charter. But attacking nuclear sites is an even more serious crime ---
one that is absolutely forbidden. It poses catastrophic environmental
risks for humanity]{.underline}."

He concluded by expressing gratitude for China's strong support and
solidarity, especially its condolences to the Iranian people, including
women and children harmed in the attacks.

[Global crude [oil prices]{.mark} have **[eased]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Markets are betting that [protracted [conflict]{.mark} is
**[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. meanwhile, [[domestic

[U.S. from global price shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

[[War broke out in the Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
[unlike]{.underline} in [decades]{.underline} past, there has [[not been
**panic**]{.mark} about a subsequent oil crisis]{.underline}. NPR\'s
Camila Domonoske is here to explain why.

CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Immediately after Israel attacked Iran, [crude
[prices did shoot up]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but
only]{.underline}]{.mark} [by about 7% over [a few
hours]{.mark}]{.underline}.

REBECCA BABIN: We saw a lot of people kind of react to that, saying [why
isn\'t crude reacting more]{.underline}? [This is a real
risk]{.underline}.

DOMONOSKE: That\'s Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private
Wealth. She says [[traders]{.underline}]{.mark} like her
[[responded]{.mark} **[conservatively]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in part
because of [[recent experience]{.mark} with Ukraine, Gaza, other
attacks]{.underline}.

BABIN: Throughout all the other [geopolitical events that have happened
over the last several years]{.underline}, [we get these [spikes]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} then [supply is not **impacted**]{.mark} and they revert
very quickly]{.underline}.

DOMONOSKE: And that\'s exactly what happened again. [[Prices were
**volatile**, but]{.mark} the spike was
[short-lived]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that was partly because of the
specifics of this conflict. Once again, [[supply wasn\'t
impacted]{.mark} because oil wasn\'t targeted]{.underline}. It kept
flowing. But there\'s also some global factors behind the quick
recovery. Angie Gildea is U.S. energy lead for the accounting giant
KPMG.

ANGIE GILDEA: You know, we are in a period of time right now within the
[energy markets where we [have]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversupply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

DOMONOSKE: The [world just has too much oil]{.underline}. Supply is
growing faster than demand. We\'re making more than we need. Then
there\'s a big overarching [geopolitical transformation]{.underline}.
The shale revolution in the [[United States]{.mark} has
[lessened]{.mark} the world\'s [**dependence** on Mideast]{.mark}
crude]{.underline}. Over a decade ago, new [technology like fracking
unlocked American oil fields]{.underline}. Jim Burkhard leads crude oil
market research at S&P Global.

JIM BURKHARD: The [U.S. is the biggest oil producer in the world by
far]{.underline}. The impact on the oil market is profound.

DOMONOSKE: The U.S[. [makes a lot of oil and could make even
more]{.mark}]{.underline}. So the U.S. is [[less **reliant** on the
Middle East]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the rest of the world has
[[**backup supplies** if it needs them]{.underline}]{.mark}. But of
course, right now, the [[world doesn\'t need more
**oil**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Quite the opposite. So while this week,
President Trump repeated his call to drill, baby, drill, Burkhard
says\...

BURKHARD: We think - we\'ve been saying for the last few months we think
U.S. oil production is going to decline.

DOMONOSKE: Because the market is telling companies to drill less - to
chill, baby, chill.

HOUSTON, July 16 (Reuters) - [[Oil prices settled **marginally
lower**]{.underline}]{.mark} on Wednesday as U.S. fuel inventory builds
and [[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} about wider economic impact from
U.S. tariffs [[outweighed some signs of **increasing
demand**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Brent crude futures [[settled]{.underline}]{.mark} 19 cents, or [[0.3%
lower]{.underline}]{.mark}, at \$68.52 a barrel. U.S. West Texas
Intermediate crude futures were down 14 cents, or 0.2%, at \$66.38.

U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 3.4 million barrels last week, the Energy
Information Administration said. Analysts had expected a draw of 1
million barrels.​

[[Distillate stockpiles]{.underline}]{.mark}, which include diesel and
heating oil, [[**rose** by 4.2 million barrels]{.underline}]{.mark}, EIA
data showed, far surpassing expectations for a 200,000-barrel rise.

Crude inventories fell by 3.9 million barrels to 422.2 million barrels
last week, the EIA said, exceeding forecasts for a 552,000-barrel draw.

\"I think the market is disappointed to see large builds in gasoline and
distillate inventories as refiners are operating at near their highest
levels of the year turning oil into refined products,\" said Andrew
Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, referring to refinery rates of
nearly 94% of total capacity.

\"I think investors are also disappointed to see gasoline demand fall
just after July 4 as we are now in the **[[peak summer driving
season]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" he added.

The amount of products supplied for gasoline, a proxy for demand, eased
670,000 barrels per day to 8.5 million bpd.

U.S. President Donald Trump\'s [[tariff war
continued]{.underline}]{.mark}, with the European Commission preparing
possible retaliation if talks with Washington fail to secure a trade
agreement for the European Union.

On Monday, Trump said the U.S. will impose \"very severe tariffs\" on
Russia in 50 days if there is no deal to stop the war in Ukraine.

Short-term U.S. interest-rate futures rose after a report that Trump was
likely to fire Federal Reserve Jerome Powell soon, with [[traders now
betting on rate cuts starting in September]{.underline}]{.mark} and at
least one more by December.

Trump said he was not planning to fire Powell, but declined to rule out
anything. Interest rate cuts typically boost economic activity and
energy demand.

Helping keep a floor under prices, [[U.S. economic activity increased
slightly in recent weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the outlook was
neutral to slightly pessimistic, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday,
as businesses reported the Trump administration\'s higher tariffs were
putting upward pressure on prices.

OPEC\'s monthly report on Tuesday forecast that the global economy would
do better in the second half of the year. Brazil, China and India are
exceeding expectations while the United States and EU are recovering
from last year, it added.

Chinese state-owned refiners are ramping up output after completing
maintenance to meet higher third-quarter fuel demand and to rebuild
diesel and gasoline stocks at multi-year lows, traders and analysts
said.

Emily **Meierding 21**, Assistant Professor, National Security Affairs,

\[italics in original\]

One critique of *The Oil Wars Myth*, expressed by both Colgan and
Ashford, is that its claims overreach. Ashford asserts that by creating
a typology of oil-related interstate conflicts, I am "caveating away"
oil wars: defining them out of existence, rather than proving that
states never fight for oil. I am sympathetic to this argument, as I
acknowledge that my typology may appear pat. However, [it
is]{.underline} also **[noteworthy]{.underline}** [that we
can]{.underline}, in fact, **[[classify all 180
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that occurred [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**-endowed
**[[territories]{.underline}]{.mark}**, from 1912--2010,
[into]{.underline} these four **[discrete]{.underline}**
[categories]{.underline}. Doing so is also a powerful clarifying device,
as [it enables us to]{.underline} **[isolate]{.underline}** [the
specific ways]{.underline} that [oil]{.underline} **[does]{.underline}**
[contribute to interstate conflict]{.underline}---in spats, campaigns,
and gambits---and the ways that it does not: in classic oil wars.

Colgan, meanwhile, accepts what he calls the "restrained" version of my
argument: that countries' willingness to fight for oil has been
overstated. However, he rejects the "unrestrained" version: that this
willingness has been dramatically exaggerated and that the idea of
classic oil wars is a myth. Colgan asserts that "While it is true that
there are no wars where oil is the *only* explanation for war, it does
not follow logically that oil is not a causal factor." The latter
statement mischaracterizes my argument. The *Oil Wars Myth* [never
claims]{.underline} that [oil is]{.underline} **[not a causal
factor]{.underline}** [in interstate conflict]{.underline}. Oil can
cause mild conflicts (oil spats: 41, 69-72, and Chapter 6). Oil may also
be a marginal, additional cause of conflicts that are launched primarily
for other reasons (red herrings: 72-77, Chapter 5). However, the book
does find that, with one possible exception, [oil has]{.underline}
**[[never]{.underline}]{.mark}** [been [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[primary cause]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of an interstate war,
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [[a]{.underline}
**[century]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of international
conflicts]{.underline}. This [finding]{.underline} **[strongly
challenges]{.underline}** [the conventional wisdom]{.underline} and
pointing that out does not seem unrestrained.

One source of Colgan and Ashford's concerns may be the distinction
between classic oil wars and oil campaigns. Colgan points out,
accurately, that my definition of classic oil wars on page 3, as "severe
militarized conflicts in which participants fight to obtain petroleum
resources" could encompass oil campaigns. However, later chapters of the
book mak[e it clear that my argument and analysis are [focus]{.mark}ed
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[conflict initiation]{.underline}**]{.mark}:
[whether countries]{.underline} ***[start]{.underline}***
[wars]{.underline} in order [to grab oil]{.underline} (see especially
16, 41, 61-68). [This is [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[vital]{.underline}**]{.mark} substantive
[[distinction]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [for understanding]{.underline}
the **[causes]{.underline}** of interstate war [and for]{.underline}
conflict **[prevention]{.underline}** [efforts]{.underline}. [If
oil]{.underline} **[prompts]{.underline}** [countries to
initiate]{.underline} severe [interstate conflicts, then energy
competition is a]{.underline} **[serious threat]{.underline}** [to
international security]{.underline} and conflict prevention efforts must
focus on resource concerns. [If]{.underline}, however, [oil is only
capable of]{.underline} **[inspiring specific campaigns]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} **[ongoing]{.underline}** [wars, then energy
competition is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [a
significant]{.underline} international security [threat]{.underline}.
Focusing our attention on oil will obscure the actual causes of
interstate conflict and lead to ineffective policy choices (170-74).
While *The Oil Wars Myth* demonstrates that [oil can inspire campaigns
in]{.underline} **[ongoing conflicts]{.underline}**, [[wars start
for]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** [reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Ashford and Colgan also present my interpretation of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, the one historical oil gambit, as an overreach. Ashford proposes
that this was, in fact, an oil grab. Colgan asserts that "Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was strongly motivated to obtain Kuwait's oil
fields" and that "it remains unclear why Iraq's conquest of
**[[Kuwait]{.underline}]{.mark}** does not fit" my classic oil war
definition. However, as Trombetta observes, *The Oil Wars Myth* fully
acknowledges that this case [[may be the]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[one
notable [exception]{.mark}]{.underline}**" [to its finding]{.underline}
that [states]{.underline} **[do not]{.underline}** [engage in classic
oil wars]{.underline}. The book repeatedly states that we could call oil
gambits classic oil wars and that Iraq's invasion is a "plausible
candidate" for this label (9, 79, 146, 160). Yet, the book also observes
that [if we call [this]{.mark} case a]{.underline} classic [oil war, "we
must]{.underline} also [acknowledge]{.underline} that these
[contests]{.underline} **[[look]{.underline}]{.mark}** quite
**[[different]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from what most of us have
imagined]{.underline}" (79). In Chapter 8, I use archival materials from
Saddam **[[Hussein]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** regime to show that while
the Iraqi leader aspired to seize Kuwait's oil as a means of addressing
an intensifying national economic crisis, his [fundamental motive for
attacking his neighbor was his belief]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [was
attempting to overthrow his regime]{.underline}, including by
manipulating world oil prices. Saddam eventually concluded that seizing
Kuwait offered the only possible means of escaping this existential
crisis. Accordingly, he also believed that he won the first Gulf War.
Although [he [did]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not]{.underline}** [hold
onto]{.underline}]{.mark} [Kuwait's [oil]{.mark}, he did hold onto power
in Iraq]{.underline}.

Another critique, expressed by multiple reviewers, pertains to the
novelty of *The Oil War Myth*'s contributions. Colgan notes, as do I,
that [other scholars have]{.underline} **[previously]{.underline}**
[questioned the existence of]{.underline} classic [oil wars]{.underline}
(6, 18-19). Ashford states that some of my observations "may be
intuitively obvious to those who work on energy markets." Focusing on my
discussion of oil campaigns, Toprani asserts that "some of \[my\]
findings only appear novel if one has not read widely about the
conflicts she describes." Rather than challenging these statements, I
heartily agree with them. Although there is much that is new in my book,
including its interpretation of the Iraq--Kuwait case and the scope of
its empirical research, there is also much that will be familiar,
especially to economists and historians. However, the reviewers'
observations effectively underline one of my book's core points: that
[[belief in]{.underline}]{.mark} classic [[oil wars
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[extraordinarily]{.underline}** [[persistent,
despite a]{.mark}n]{.underline} [**[extended history]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [theoretical and empirical
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Colgan's review illustrates this point by reiterating the same
narratives about Japan's and Germany's oil campaigns that Toprani says
historians have rejected. Colgan also repeats a widely accepted but
inaccurate claim that, during the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein's
armies "even briefly invaded an oil-rich part of Saudi Arabia in search
of more \[oil\]." The invasion Colgan refers to is presumably the Battle
of Khafji (January 29--February 1, 1991), which began twelve days into
the Coalition bombing campaign. Iraqi troops crossed into Saudi Arabia
and temporarily occupied the town of Khafji, seven miles south of the
border, along the Persian Gulf coast. Khafji possessed an oil refinery
and export terminal. However, the town was located over forty miles from
Saudi Arabia's nearest oil fields (Jauf and Sharar). More importantly,
the Iraqis did not intend to hold the town. They launched the attack as
a raid, hoping to draw Coalition forces into a ground war, thereby
causing enough American casualties for the public outcry to compel the
Bush administration to withdraw from the conflict.\[54\] Oil was not a
goal. Nonetheless, the oil wars myth encourages us to accept these kinds
of interpretations at face value, because they align with our
uninterrogated assumptions about oil and international aggression (21).

I conclude this response by addressing a question and an omission
highlighted by the reviewers. First, Toprani asks "why nations would
consciously choose to sustain the myth of 'oil wars'? Since when had
designating a conflict an 'oil war' made it more popular?" As I observe
above, [perpetuation of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[oil wars
myth]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[unconscious]{.underline}. The belief that oil is a significant cause of
conflict encourages us to interpret new acts of international aggression
through that lens. Accordingly, [we identify]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}** ["oil wars," whose existence]{.underline} then
**[reinforces]{.underline}** [the myth's]{.underline} apparent
[validity]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the narrative is repeated in academic
literature and popular culture, cementing the oil wars myth as part of
our collective understanding of how the world works. The [myth
is]{.underline} therefore **[[self-reinforcing]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
That said, some actors have also deliberately bolstered the oil wars
myth. As I describe in Chapter 5, [multiple actors]{.underline}
**[falsely]{.underline}** [identified the Chaco conflict as an oil
war]{.underline}, for instrumental purposes. One of these purposes was
to discredit adversaries; saying that an opponent is fighting for oil is
an excellent way to tarnish its reputation. Blaming the war on
international oil companies was also a way for leaders to evade
responsibility for the increasingly devastating conflict. Finally, as
the war dragged on, the oil war interpretation offered a hope that
belligerents might eventually gain some benefit from their interminable
efforts. In short, the oil war label may not be an effective way for an
aggressor to initially rally its troops. But it does have other uses.

The [discovery and exploitation of crude [oil]{.mark}]{.underline} have
literally [[**transformed** the world]{.underline}]{.mark} beyond all
recognition.

This was such a great discovery, that our modern world is literally
fuelled by it.

If the [crude [oil]{.mark}]{.underline} supply was to suddenly [[dry up,
could we **survive**]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Crude oil is one of the most important resources we have ever
discovered. Oil and the many products made from it have [literally and
figuratively transformed the world beyond all recognition]{.underline}.
However, as we are constantly reminded, [crude [oil is not in **infinite
supply**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, it took millions of years to
"brew".

Estimates vary, but if our [[current **consumption** continues]{.mark}
apace]{.underline}, we may well see a time in the near future when it is
completely exhausted. But, are such claims true? Have [we
[reached]{.mark}]{.underline} what is commonly referred to as "**[[peak
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**?".

But, before we get into the weeds about the future of oil, let's spend a
little time discussing the nature of a "finite" resource.

[Are natural resources actually finite?]{.underline}

[[Humans]{.underline}]{.mark} like to [[build]{.underline}]{.mark}
stuff. We've been doing it for as long as our species has existed,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} will [continue to [do so into the **distant
future**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Making stuff needs materials]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [depending
on]{.underline} what we are [[making]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how [much
of it]{.underline}, this can consume large amounts of that raw
resource(s). For any product you can think of, somewhere in its [[supply
chain raw materials]{.underline}]{.mark} have been
[[extracted]{.underline}]{.mark} at some point and "used up" in the
**[[final product]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As more and [[more stuff is made over time]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
would seem logical that there must be a point when the supply of any
material is used up? But is this actually true?

How you think about this might, ultimately, all come down to whether you
are a pessimist or an optimist at heart. The former will adamantly
believe that because there is only a limited amount of stuff humans
could ever get our hands-on (like the entire mass of the Earth, say),
then resources must, by definition, be limited. This is especially true
if our consumption of a material exceeds the rate of its replenishment.
It is this fact that basically determines if a resource is considered
"renewable" or not.

The [more **[optimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} at heart, however,
[realize]{.underline} that there is a [[big
universe]{.underline}]{.mark} out there [[full of]{.mark} all the
[potential sources]{.mark}]{.underline} of stuff we could ever need. If
we ever did run out of [something like copper on Earth]{.underline}, we
could, with enough effort, "pop-out" to space and get some from another
planet or asteroid.

Of course, this "[[space stuff]{.underline}]{.mark}" is also [[by
definition limited]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it is such an **[[enormous
quantity]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it is, effectively, infinite. All
we need to do is go out there and get it. Until such time as we can do
this, however, we will need to make do with what we have here on Earth.
Thankfully, we [[humans]{.mark} have a great [knack for getting better
at doing things over time]{.mark}]{.underline}.

When required of us, we have [managed to [find ways to use stuff more
efficiently]{.mark}]{.underline}, find
[[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[just as]{.mark}
[good]{.mark}]{.underline}, or, indeed, [develop ways to recycle or
recover stuff from other stuff if needed]{.underline}. We have also
found ways to use [[materials]{.underline}]{.mark} for entirely
[[different purposes]{.underline}]{.mark} from what we are used [to
[using something]{.mark} for]{.underline}.

Take [gold]{.underline}, for example. For most of the time that humans
have been able to extract and refine it, gold has mostly been used as
jewelry or as a means of exchange. With the advent of the electronics
age, however, gold was found to also be a fantastic electrical
conductor.

While this does, obviously, increase the relative consumption of the
metal, [[humans]{.mark} have found ways to [use]{.mark} it more
[sparingly]{.mark}]{.underline} over time, or use alternatives instead.
We have even [found [new sources]{.mark} for this precious metal once
thought impossible]{.underline} --- "fool's gold".

Not only that, but we have also devised ways to recover gold from old
used electronics. So, while gold, as a resource, is being "used up", in
one sense, it is not being destroyed, per se.

It is simply being "stored" in the stuff we make it from.
[Theoretically, we could [recover it all in the future]{.mark} if we
wanted to]{.underline}.

So, for all intents and purposes, [[gold is]{.mark} effectively in
[infinite supply]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit rare. [The [same]{.mark}
is probably true [for]{.mark} things like crude [oil]{.mark}
too]{.underline}.

In reality, what people mean [when they say]{.underline} a resource is
"**[[running out]{.underline}]{.mark}**" is that it will
[[become]{.mark} more]{.underline} [[expensive or take]{.mark} [more
energy]{.mark}]{.underline} to remove and process than it is worth ---
or that so little can be extracted that it is not worth the effort ---
not that it will literally be gone never to be seen again. [This is also
[true of crude oil]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unless its products are [combusted, crude [oil can be
"**stored**"]{.mark}]{.underline} in the form of things like plastic and
plastic bags. In a future where crude oil becomes restrictively
expensive to extract, [could we see a future where [landfills become a
source of **hydrocarbons** for fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Amazingly, this is not pure science fiction. Some
[researchers]{.underline} are already working on [[ways to **convert**
plastic bags]{.mark} back into [oil]{.mark}]{.underline}. If ever [[made
**economically viable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, our [[tendency to
bury]{.underline}]{.mark} our old trash could, perhaps, be thought of
[as a [way of "saving" potential fuel for the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### AT: Oil Price Wars\-\--New Production\-\--1NC

#### The impact is delayed, and new production solves.

**McFadden '22** \[Christopher; 11/09/2022; qualified and accredited
Energy Consultant, Green Deal Assessor and Practitioner member of IEMA;
Don't worry, we'll never run out of oil,
https://interestingengineering.com/science/we-will-never-run-out-of-oil;
akshaj\]

[[How much oil is left]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}?

[Estimating the remaining oil reserves]{.underline} of the planet is
[notoriously difficult]{.underline}, and [frankly, subject to constant
change]{.underline}. The reasons for this vary but are [primarily
dictated by our technological ability]{.underline} to [exploit oil
reserves]{.underline} in the first place and also the [difficulty of
estimating future demand]{.underline}.

That being said, at current consumption, we have by some accounts an
estimated 47 years of oil left to be extracted. That equates to
somewhere in the region of [[**1.65 trillion** barrels]{.mark} of proven
oil reserves]{.underline}. Other sources up this estimate a bit, but
most agree we have around 50 years left, give or take.

For reference, a barrel of crude oil is about 42 gallons or about 159
liters.

With regards to other fossil fuels, we have an [[estimated **53 years**
of natural gas]{.mark}, and [**114 years** of coal left]{.mark} to rip
out of the ground]{.underline}.

While that sounds like quite a lot, estimates of [47 years are based on
oil consumption]{.underline} being maintained at [around 35 and half
billion barrels a year]{.underline}, or [[**97 million** barrels of oil
**a day**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based on the 2016 world population, that
works out at around 5 barrels per person per year, or [0.5 gallons per
person, per day.]{.underline}

The main producers of oil to date include countries like Venezuela, who
have around 18 percent of the world's share of oil, Saudi Arabia with
around 16 percent, Canada with around 10.5 percent, Iran, and Iraq with
about 9.5 percent and 8.7 percent respectively.

Oil has various uses once extracted, but the vast majority is distilled
to make liquid fuels like gasoline or is used to make plastic or
chemicals. So long as societies around the world maintain their demand
for fuel, plastic, and other stuff made, in part, from crude oil, an
estimate of 47 years is probably quite conservative.

Especially if the global population, and demand, rises over time.

However, if the [[global push for **decarbonization**]{.mark} is
[accelerated]{.mark}]{.underline}, or indeed successful, this estimate
will prove to be a gross underestimate of remaining reserves. Another
[problem with estimations]{.underline} of remaining oil reserves is the
fact they are necessarily blind to what we don't know. Potential [**[new
stocks of oil]{.mark}** are [found]{.mark} all the time]{.underline}.

It is also important to note that global proven reserves have increased
over time. This, as we [previously touched upon]{.underline}, is mainly
a [consequence of [improved **technology** and **extraction**
methods]{.mark}]{.underline} that have made previously [unexploitable
oil [reserves]{.mark} economically and physically [viable for
extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As [oil becomes harder]{.underline} and harder [to extract]{.underline},
and while [demand remains high]{.underline} for oil, improved and
[**[innovative]{.mark}** [methods]{.mark} to extract oil are
[bound]{.mark}]{.underline} to be investigated and mastered. For
example, d[irectional drilling]{.underline}, or the ability to direct a
boring head subsurface, was [once thought too challenging]{.underline}
to make [economically viable]{.underline} but is now [pretty much
standard practice]{.underline}.

It is highly likely that something [[equally as innovative]{.mark} will
be devised in the future]{.underline}, so long as consumer [demand
remains high enough]{.underline}. But more on that later.

[Will we ever run out of oil]{.underline}?

Before we answer this question, we'll need to expand on the term
"proven" we mentioned earlier. This is important to understand as it
will help us honestly address whether or not oil will ever run out.

"Proven" [oil reserves are those oil reserves that any given region can
theoretically extract based on the infrastructure]{.underline} they have
in place or plan to have in the near future. This is obviously
dependent, as we previously stated, on the [oil extraction methods and
technology]{.underline}.

However, it is important to note that any oil left in already tapped oil
reserves is not necessarily useable. Often termed "heavy" or "sour" oil,
this stuff is pretty poor quality. It is also not always in a liquid
form and can contain large amounts of contaminants like sulfur.

Sulfur is a big deal as it is very corrosive to steel, which is
obviously not good news for equipment like that used in refineries.
Sulfur-rich oil is very complex and energy-intensive to process which
obviously increases the cost of bringing it to market.

One such material is bitumen. This is a very viscous (sticky) low-grade
form of crude oil that can be distilled to make petroleum. It can also
be used "as is" as a binder for many other things like asphalt, roofing
products, damp-proofing, etc.

It is so sticky that the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers
(CAPP) often compares it to "cold molasses". Producers like the CAPP
have greatly improved their technological capacity over the past few
decades which, by extension, has necessarily increased Canada's proven
reserves as a consequence.

[Other [technological developments like]{.mark}]{.underline} hydraulic
fracturing (**[[fracking]{.underline}]{.mark}**), have also contributed
to increasing the world's proven reserves despite an increase in global
consumption (and attracting controversy).

Another more recent innovation is our ability to process and extract
shale oil, more specifically a material called kerogen (a waxy mixture
of hydrocarbon compounds). This tends to be found within shale deposits
and needs to be heated to around 932 degrees Fahrenheit (500 degrees
centigrade) to extract and process. This process converts the solid
kerogen into something similar to oil. What's more, there is an absolute
glut of this stuff in places like the USA.

According to some estimates, there are "trillions" of barrels of shale
oil in the U.S. alone. However, the actual energy return on energy
invested (EROEI) to extract and refine shale oil is so poor that there
has been no serious commercial exploitation of oil shale to date.

Another important term to get to grips with is "technically recoverable
resources", or TRR for short. This is used to refer to those oil
reserves that can be extracted using current methods and technology but
may not be profitable to do so. In other words, the oil can be pulled
out, but any company doing it will likely lose money doing so --- making
it pointless.\
So why would they bother?

As it happens, according to the Energy Information Authority (EIA), the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark}]{.underline} somewhere in
the region of [[373 billion]{.mark} [barrels]{.mark} of TRR
oil]{.underline}. On the other hand, it has only around 47 billion
barrels of "proven" reserves.

[Technically recoverable oil]{.underline} is also liable to [greatly
fluctuate in quantity]{.underline}.

"Estimates of TRR are highly uncertain, particularly in emerging plays
where relatively [few wells]{.underline} have been
[drilled]{.underline}," explains the EIA. "Early [estimates]{.underline}
tend to [vary and shift significantly [over time]{.mark}]{.underline}
because [[new **geological information**]{.underline}]{.mark} is gained
through [additional drilling]{.underline}, because [[long-term
**productivity**]{.underline}]{.mark} is clarified for existing wells,
and because the productivity of new wells [[increases]{.mark} with
[technology]{.mark} improvements [and]{.mark} better management
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}."

By way of comparison, the amount of technically recoverable oil was
around 143.5 billion barrels in 1990. Current EIA figures effectively
double this today.

"Technology and geologic knowledge increased faster than U.S.
production, therefore increasing estimates of technically recoverable
resources through time," explains Scott Lauermann, a spokesperson for
the American Petroleum Institute.

"You cannot take today's estimates of technically recoverable resources
and estimate when we will 'run out' because those estimates are based on
today's technology and known formations, not tomorrow's."

But, like anything in life, you only know what you know. Potentially
there is an even larger amount of undiscovered technically recoverable
resources, meaning resources the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) predicts
are there.

"[[Undiscovered resources]{.underline}]{.mark} are those that are
[estimated to exist [based on geology]{.mark}]{.underline}, geophysics,
geochemistry, and our familiarity with similar basins and rock
formations. They have not yet been proven to exist via drilling,"
explains Alex Demas, a spokesperson for the USGS.

Who knows, there could be an effectively unlimited supply out there. We
just don't know it yet.

[[Will we ever use up all the world's supply of
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}?

In short, **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We've explained the main
reasons above, but there is another factor to consider --- the relative
rarity of a resource.

### AT: Oil Price Wars\-\--Kazakhstan Oil Shocks\-\--2NC

#### Kazakhstan's economy is resilient.

Muhammad **Rafiq 22**. Senior banker based in Kazakhstan. \"Economic
Resilience of Kazakhstan\". 9-16-2022. Astana Times.
https://astanatimes.com/2022/09/economic-resilience-of-kazakhstan/

[[Kazakhstan has emerged as the **biggest success story**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, since the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Transitioning from a central command economy to a market system has been
an epic advancement. The salient feature of the economic development
achieved by Kazakhstan is its economic resilience. [The [ability to
recover]{.mark} quickly from a shock, [withstand]{.mark} a shock, [and
avoid]{.mark} the [shock]{.mark} altogether, [is the primary attribute
of economic resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline}

During the initial decade of the 1990s, a wide range of inherited
hardships was faced by Kazakhstan, the fledgling state, that included
peak inflation of 3,000 percent, an agrarian economy having 36 percent
share in production, local products only meeting 42 percent consumer
demand, largely a raw material supplier country, only 20 percent
passengers and 12 percent cargo using railway transport, and barely 4
percent passengers using air and water routes.

In fact, Kazakhstan had a strategic aspiration to become a modern,
diversified market economy well integrated into the global economy. The
hydrocarbon resources were viewed as a good basis to achieve this goal.
Therefore, Kazakhstan undertook a process of privatization, price
liberalization, de-monopolization, debt restructuring, custom reforms,
and tax restructuring. Moreover, Kazakhstan established a securities and
exchange commission, enacted laws on investment, liberalized trade,
reformed the banking system, and established a new government
procurement system. These measures were acknowledged globally.
Kazakhstan was recognized as a country with a market economy by the
European Union in 2001 and the United States in 2002.

The prudent policies implemented by Kazakhstan have produced the desired
dividends. The difficulties faced in the first decade of independence
have been overcome. So far Kazakhstan has attracted US\$390 billion in
foreign direct investment. The comparative advantage of having a
strategic location between Europe and Asia has been optimized. Reliance
on diverse investment resources from the Netherlands, the US, China,
Russia, Switzerland, the UK, France, Belgium, and Türkiye is another key
advantage.

Investment is blood in the veins of an economy. Investors are loyal
until economic stability prevails. Economic stability is maintained when
an economy is resilient. It is the economic resilience of Kazakhstan
that has made the country a global investment hub. Despite the negative
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, Kazakhstan in
2020 demonstrated the largest increase of 34.9 percent (US\$3.9
billion[)]{.underline} in net foreign direct investment among 17
countries with a transition economy and 34 landlocked countries. Such
investing confidence is exceptional keeping in view the decline of 35
percent in global investment.

Let us analyze two recent events that shocked Kazakhstan but its
economic resilience restored stability.

During the first week of January 2022, an outbreak of violence took
place in Kazakhstan when peaceful rallies against the rise of gas prices
turned into terrorist turmoil. The protests were hijacked by bandits,
looters, and armed terrorists. Almaty, the commercial and financial
center of Central Asia, was the epicenter of violence. The perpetrators
tried to disorganize the government institutions and undermine the
constitutional order. President of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev rose
to the occasion and made an immediate change at the helm of the National
Security Committee which is a key counter-terrorism agency. Alikhan
Smailov was elevated to the position of Prime Minister. President
Tokayev assigned immediate tasks to the new government to restructure
and bring about targeted reforms to address the crisis and support the
long-term well-being of the people of Kazakhstan.

At the official request of the government of Kazakhstan, a peacekeeping
contingent of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)
arrived. Against all international rumors, the peacekeeping forces of
CSTO left Kazakhstan on Jan. 19, after assisting the law and order
forces of Kazakhstan in stabilizing the situation and restoring the rule
of law.

[A big [number of measures have]{.mark} already [been implemented
under]{.mark} the [**comprehensive action plan** of]{.mark} equal
distribution of wealth, uniform regional development, eradication of
poverty, and [long-term]{.mark} [stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
crisis, some amazing socio-economic values were observed. During this
troubled time, local citizens demonstrated respect for the foreigners
and helped them in procuring groceries. When after de-escalation of
violence, local citizens swarmed into the utility stores, none of them
tried to capture more than one or two boxes of eggs, packs of milk and
bread, etc., in sheer regard for everyone's needs.

[[The gov]{.mark}ernment [of Kazakhstan was]{.mark} very [successful
in]{.mark} the **[price control]{.mark}** of consumer
items.]{.underline} The entrepreneurs suffering damage during the fierce
violence also received state compensation. Moreover, the depreciation of
tenge was also not experienced due to effective exchange control of the
Central Bank. By the end of January, things were back to normal.
[[Prompt]{.mark} [recovery from]{.mark} the [shocks]{.mark} of January
events [evidences]{.mark} the [resilience]{.mark} of Kazakhstan's
economy.]{.underline}

Then, the [outbreak of the [Russia-Ukraine conflict was another]{.mark}
shock for the Kazakh economy]{.underline}. Two third of oil exports of
the country take place via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), the
world's largest international oil transportation project involving
Russian and Kazakh companies to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the
Black Sea. [The country's [oil exports]{.mark} through this route [have
been disrupted]{.mark}]{.underline} several times. Being aware of its
potential as a transit hub, Kazakhstan is seeking to re-route part of
its oil exports via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that ends in
Turkey.

The prevailing geopolitical situation was creating delays at ports in
transporting Kazakh cargo due to sanctions imposed against Russia.
[[Hence, Kazakhstan]{.mark} has [switched]{.mark} its focus [to]{.mark}
the [alternative route]{.mark} the Middle Corridor]{.underline} i.e.
Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR) that runs through
China, Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and
European countries. KTZ Express confirms that the volume of shipments
along TITR has tripled in the first seven months of 2022 i.e. from
311,000 tons to 845,000 tons. This is how the resilient economy of
Kazakhstan finds its way amid a critical situation.

[[It is obvious that]{.mark} the **economic [developers]{.mark}** in
Kazakhstan [have **played a**]{.mark} **very [strategic role]{.mark}**
[in building]{.mark} economic [resilience. Efforts]{.mark} are always
there to [enable the Kazakh economy to recover from]{.mark} the
[downturns]{.mark} in the [national or global]{.mark} economy, [and
external impacts]{.mark} from natural or man-made disasters. [The
**inherent economic resilience has magnetic significance** for]{.mark}
foreign direct [investment.]{.mark} Kazakhstan is the recipient of 70
percent of FDI inflows to Central Asia. Therefore[, Kazakhstan
is]{.mark} **[progressing well]{.mark}** toward its goal [to become one
of the world's top]{.mark} 30 [economies]{.mark} by
2050]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### It\'s reducing oil production and committing to structural reforms.

With these oil cuts in place and pandemic restrictions, the country's
economy contracted by 2.6 percent in 2020. But more should be done to
ensure the country is on a sustainable path towards recovery.

"Kazakhstan's recovery will face challenges, as it deals with a wave of
new coronavirus infections. Vaccination is gathering pace, with a target
of roughly 30 percent of the population by end-June 2021. If successful,
this will aid in the easing of economic restrictions," said the
statement.

Fitch [[experts forecast Kazakhstan will]{.mark} continue its [**strong
fiscal** and **monetary policy stimulus**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021
[and expect Kazakh economic growth to rebound]{.underline} to 3.7
percent in 2021 assuming a recovery in oil prices, expansion of
Kazakhstan's major Tengiz project and the recent legislation that
allowed citizens to withdraw pension savings.

### AT: Oil Price Wars\-\--Blocking Fails\-\--1NC

#### Blocking Hormuz would either be suicide or would have no lasting effect

Al **Jazeera 25**, extensive coverage of global and Middle Eastern
geopolitics, 6/23/25, "Can Iran really shut down the Strait of Hormuz?,"
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/23/can-iran-really-shut-down-the-strait-of-hormuz,
Troh

In his first comments since the US strikes, Iran's Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Israel has made a "grave mistake" and
"must be punished", but did not make any specific reference to either
Washington or the Strait of Hormuz.

[[How would the closure work in practice?]{.underline}]{.mark}

Iran could attempt to lay mines across the Strait of Hormuz.

The country's army or the paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC) may also try to strike or seize vessels in the Gulf, a method
they have used on several occasions in the past.

During the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, the two sides engaged in the so-called
"Tanker Wars" in the Persian Gulf. Iraq targeted Iranian ships, and Iran
attacked commercial ships, including Saudi and Kuwaiti oil tankers and
even US Navy ships.

Tensions in the strait flared up again at the end of 2007 in a series of
skirmishes between the Iranian and US navies. This included one incident
where Iranian speedboats approached US warships, though no shots were
fired.

In April 2023, Iranian troops seized the Advantage Sweet crude tanker,
which was chartered by Chevron, in the Gulf of Oman. The vessel was
released more than a year later.

[[What would it mean for the global economy?]{.underline}]{.mark}

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday called on China to encourage
Iran to not shut down the Strait of Hormuz after Washington carried out
strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

Speaking to Fox News, [[Rubio said]{.underline}: "[It's economic
**suicide** for them if they do it]{.underline}]{.mark} \[close the
strait\]. And we retain options to deal with that, but other countries
should be looking at that as well[. [It would hurt other countries'
economies a lot worse than ours."]{.mark}]{.underline}

For starters, [[shutting Hormuz risks bringing **Gulf Arab
states**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- which have been highly critical of the
Israeli attack -- [[into the war to safeguard their own commercial
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Closing the strait would also hit **China**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The world's second-largest economy buys almost 90 percent of Iran's
oil exports]{.underline}]{.mark} (roughly 1.6 million barrels per day),
which are subject to international sanctions.

According to Goldman Sachs, a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could
push oil prices above \$100 per barrel. That would push the cost of
production up, eventually affecting consumer prices -- especially for
energy-intensive goods like food, clothing and chemicals.

Oil-importing countries around the world could experience higher
inflation and slower economic growth if the conflict persists, which
could prompt central banks to push back the timing of future rate cuts.

[[But **history has shown that severe disruptions to global oil supplies
have tended to be short-lived.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Before the start of the second Gulf War]{.underline}]{.mark}, between
March and May 2003, [[crude oil surged by a whopping 46
percent]{.underline}]{.mark} at the end of 2002. [[But prices quickly
unwound in the days preceding the start of the US-led military
campaign.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Similarly, [[Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked a
sharp rally in oil prices to \$130 a barrel, but prices returned to
their pre-invasion levels of \$95 by mid-August.]{.underline}]{.mark}

These relatively quick reversals of oil price spikes were largely due to
global spare production capacity available at the time, and the fact
that the rapid oil price increase curbed demand.

## Fish

### AT: Fish\-\--Rebuilt\-\--1NC

#### Species are being [rebuilt]{.underline}.

**NOAA 25 --** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (2/10,
"Status of Stocks 2023"
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/status-stocks-2023)
akshaj

NOAA Fisheries manages 506 stocks or stock complexes in 45 fishery
management plans. At the end of 2023, the overfishing list included 21
stocks, the overfished list included 47 stocks, and one stock was
rebuilt, [bringing the number of rebuilt stocks to 50]{.underline} since
2000.

We determine the status of fish stocks and stock complexes through stock
assessments and by comparing catch data to an overfishing reference
level. Of the 506 stocks and stock complexes, 364 have a known
overfishing status (343 not subject to overfishing and 21 subject to
overfishing) and 263 have a known overfished status (216 not overfished
and 47 overfished). Of the stocks most targeted by fishermen, 88 percent
have a known overfishing status and 89 percent have a known overfished
status. These stocks are contained in the Fish Stock Sustainability
Index.

[Rebuilding our 50th fish stock]{.underline} was a [major milestone for
2023]{.underline}. Snohomish coho salmon was determined to be overfished
in 2018 and has now rebuilt to its sustainable level. A combination of
[responsive fishery management]{.underline} and [habitat restoration
helped to rebuild this important fish population]{.underline}. Snohomish
coho salmon is the latest rebuilding success that dates back to 2000,
when Atlantic sea scallop was the first stock declared rebuilt under the
Magnuson-Stevens Act requirements.

Another significant achievement this year includes nine first-time stock
assessments for American Samoa bottomfish. Previously assessed as an
11-stock complex, the [American Samoa bottomfish]{.underline} stock
complex [was determined to be overfished]{.underline} and subject to
overfishing [in 2020]{.underline}. Stock assessments conducted in 2023
incorporated [new and improved data, allowing scientists to
assess]{.underline} these [bottomfish]{.underline} as seven individual
stocks and two stock complexes (containing two stocks each), [none of
which were overfished or subject to overfishing.]{.underline}

Additional accomplishments include a [fishery management plan amendment
that allowed for first-time status determinations for six Pacific coast
groundfish stocks. Five of these stocks were found to be not
overfished]{.underline}, while quillback rockfish--California was
determined to be overfished. Determining the status of previously
unknown stocks advances our knowledge and provides managers the
information they need to develop appropriate management responses.
Finally, Atlantic chub mackerel had a first-time overfishing status
determination (not subject to overfishing) using catch compared to its
reference level.

[The focus is on sustainable fisheries]{.underline} in the context of
climate change and the green transition. The aim of the research
initiative is to examine the impact of fishing activities on the marine
environment and the options for fisheries to reduce their impact.

The chair of the Call Committee Petri Suuronen says:

"The call received a delightful number of excellent and coherent
applications. The [scientific quality of]{.underline} the [proposals
selected for funding was very high]{.underline}. They had well-defined
and innovative methodologies and incorporated strong collaboration
aspects. New approaches were presented in assessing the feasibility and
effectiveness of time and area closures as a fisheries management tool;
a challenging task because the effects often are complex and
multifaceted. The role of climate change on fish stocks and ecosystems
was well addressed, and the obvious need for renewed management
strategies to better support ecosystem services was stressed. Selected
proposals are very likely to deliver valuable new knowledge."

But the ocean is a dynamic place, and [fish management is always
evolving]{.underline}. Sustainable fisheries are a continuous journey,
not a destination. NOAA and our partners continually monitor our dynamic
ocean resource to figure out if overfishing is happening. When we find
it, we respond quickly and then enforce sustainable measures and
practices. And the proof --- [overfishing and overfished
numbers]{.underline} are [at near-record lows.]{.underline}

Our Status of the Stocks Report shows [91 percent of stocks are not
subject to overfishing]{.underline} --- that's what happens when the
harvest rate is too high. And [84 percent of fish stocks are not
overfished]{.underline} --- where the population size is too low. But
the total number of stocks subject to either category is always
changing. Typically, some are removed from a list each year.

[43---The number of once-overfished stocks considered
rebuilt]{.underline} since the year 2000

Even when a stock is overfished, the [U.S. fisheries management system
allows a limited harvest to keep fishermen working while the fishery
rebuilds.]{.underline} This [rewards fishermen for compliance and
stewardship]{.underline} and keeps our economy going [while the species
grows in number. U.S. federal fisheries]{.underline} are all under the
same [robust fishery management]{.underline} plans and [held accountable
to sustainability standards]{.underline}. NOAA Fisheries works to
support the fishermen who play by the rules to help keep the U.S. a
global leader in sustainable fisheries management.

The Magnuson-Stevens Act --- which celebrated its 40th birthday in April
2016 --- is the primary law governing fishing in the U.S. Enacted in
1976, this visionary legislation set up a system that partners NOAA with
states and stakeholders to work on fishery management.

Over time, we've [built a robust science-based management process to
assess and predict fish stocks, establish catch limits and reduce
bycatch]{.underline}. The goal is to keep fish and marine mammal stocks
healthy, sustainable and resilient to support a vibrant economy and
ecosystem for future generations.

From Arctic to Caribbean climates and from small subsistence fisheries
to large industrial fleets, U.S. fisheries are quite diverse. Through
our regional fishery management councils, [every state has key
stakeholders]{.underline} at the table, [including the fishers,
conservationists, and scientists]{.underline}. The U.S. also has three
state fishery management commissions.

States generally manage fisheries within three miles of the coastline,
while N[OAA regulates from there out to about 200 miles from
shore]{.underline}. NOAA is responsible for managing 11.4 million square
miles of ocean --- the largest fisheries jurisdiction in the world.
Beyond 200 miles, you enter international waters. [NOAA does manage U.S.
fleets in international waters]{.underline} and we work, [negotiate and
build capacity in the international arena to keep global fisheries
covered too]{.underline}. Enforcing compliance is key to creating a
level playing field for American fishermen.

In June 2014, President Obama launched a multi-agency task force to
combat illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing and seafood
fraud. In March 2015, the task force published a final action plan with
a list of recommendations. NOAA is taking a lead role in implementing
these recommendations. For more details and to give your input, visit

Let's enjoy some [[unequivocal]{.mark}, inarguable [good
news]{.mark}]{.underline}: a paper published today in PNAS, Hilborn et
al. 2020, shows that [on average]{.underline}, scientifically-assessed
[[fish populations]{.mark} around the]{.underline} [world]{.underline}
[[are]{.underline} **[healthy]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[improving]{.underline}**]{.mark}. And, for fish populations that are
not doing well, [there is a [**clear roadmap** to
sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}. With Australia on fire and scares
of World War III, the start of 2020 and the new decade has been awful;
hopefully Hilborn et al. 2020 can kickstart a [decade of **ocean
optimism**.]{.underline}

[Hilborn]{.underline} et al. 2020 [counters the perception]{.underline}
that [fish populations around the world are declining]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} the [only solution is closing vast swaths of ocean to
fishing]{.underline}. Instead, Hilborn et al. 2020 argues that
increasing scientific, management, and enforcement capacity will lead to
more abundant and sustainable oceans. The major takeaway of the paper is
that **[fishery [management works]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[when
fisheries are managed, they are sustained]{.underline}. The [[key
is]{.mark} [following]{.mark} the science-to-management
[blueprint]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scientific data collection and fishery
assessment comes first, then fishing regulation and enforcement of
fishing policies. With the blueprint in place, [[most]{.mark}
fisheries]{.underline} around the world [[are sustainable]{.mark} or
improving]{.underline}.

The paper uses updates to the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, a
decades-long project to assemble data on fish populations that are
scientifically assessed. As of 2019, the database contains data on 882
marine fish populations, representing about half of reported wild-caught
seafood. In 2009, the database contained data on only 166, representing
a much smaller proportion of global seafood. [Researchers]{.underline}
have [spent the last 10 years adding to the database]{.underline}, and
with today's publication, update the global status of fish stocks. [They
found]{.underline} that, on average, [[fish populations are **above**
target]{.mark} level[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not every stock is doing
well, but on average, [[things are **much better**]{.mark} than they
were 2 decades ago]{.underline}. How nice: an environmental story where
things are better now than they were in the past!

The paper describes the global status of fish stocks, but it also tells
the story of fishery sustainability from the past 50 years.

A brief history of commercial fishing and fishery science

A very general history of industrial fishing goes like this: before the
1950s, commercial fishing was a niche industry supplying a small
proportion of the world's protein. Then, starting [in the
1950s]{.underline}, a [global effort to increase food
security]{.underline} [led]{.underline} governments [to invest heavily
in fishing]{.underline}---often too heavily. Over the next few decades,
it [became clear that many fisheries were overcapitalized]{.underline},
meaning there were too many boats, too many fishermen, or some
combination of the two. Put simply: fishing pressure was too high and
eventually led to unsustainable, depleted fish stocks. In the 1990s, the
collapse of several prominent fisheries and many high-profile media
stories and scientific publications pressured governments to start
taking action to protect their fish stocks. [The U.S. in 1996 and the EU
in 2002 began mandating their fishery policies]{.underline} to be based
on fishery science. Take a look at the last 50 years of fish stocks:

You can see a big increase in fishing pressure and declining abundance
through the mid-1990s, then a decrease in fishing pressure and recovery
of abundance to the present day.

RAM Database: From Worm et al. 2009 to Hilborn et al. 2020

[In 2009, [Worm]{.mark} et al. was published]{.underline}. It was the
first paper to put together and present global fish abundance data over
time. It is now one of the most important and highly-cited fisheries
paper in history. The data from that paper eventually became the RAM
Legacy Stock Assessment database, where anyone could access information
about specific stock assessments from around the world. When the paper
was published, it showed a general trend of stabilization in the 166
fish populations it reported on. However, [it was [criticized
for]{.mark} mainly including stocks from North America, Europe, and
Oceania]{.underline}, [[painting]{.mark} a [global
picture]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with data from]{.mark} only a
[few]{.mark} regions]{.underline}. Hilborn et al. 2020 updates that work
to 882 populations including a much broader global scope. The added
decade of data also shows a more positive, upward trend: [[78% of
fisheries considered overfished]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline}
Worm et al. [2009]{.underline} [[are improved]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in]{.underline} Hilborn et al. [2020]{.underline}.

Fish stock assessments

It all starts with stock assessments. Stock assessments are the backbone
of fishery management. They involve fishery scientists first collecting
and modeling various environmental and fishing data to estimate the
biomass (a.k.a abundance) of a stock, then estimating how much fish can
be harvested sustainably. Stock assessments are the information that
governments and managers need to regulate fishing pressure to the level
that leads to maximum sustainable yield (MSY), often the goal of fishery
management.

Sustainability has two basic steps:

Scientists perform a stock assessment to recommend how much fish should
be harvested.

Fishery managers and regulators follow and enforce that recommendation.

It seems simple, but the last 70 years of commercial fishing has shown
it is anything but. Stock assessments are expensive. They require
scientific and financial capacity that many countries do not have. The
obvious reason Worm et al. 2009 had mostly North American and European
stocks---those countries had resources to assess their fisheries.
Hilborn et al. 2020 makes a point to recognize the global effort to
increase fishery management capacity around the world.

Below is a Kobe plot over time, a fun way to visualize the complete
history of fisheries assessments. On the x-axis is the ratio of biomass
to biomass at MSY. On the y-axis is the ratio of fishing pressure to the
right amount of fishing pressure (fishing pressure at MSY). The lines
represent relative MSY targets with stocks closest to the intersection
being closest to theoretical MSY. A stock would be above biomass targets
and fished softly in the lower right quadrant (perfectly sustainable),
below biomass targets and fished softly in the lower left quadrant
(rebuilding), below biomass targets and fished too hard in the upper
left quadrant (very bad), or above biomass targets and fished hard in
the upper right quadrant (developing fishery and/or management needs to
get it together). You can watch the egg-looking concentration move over
time following the general trend of fishing hard and depleting stocks in
the 1970s-1990s, then a slow rebuild over time. You can also see stocks
getting added to the data as countries began performing more stock
assessments. For a more detailed explanation of Kobe plots and the
terminology used see Sustainable Seafood 101, a guide meant to explain
every aspect of fishery science in an easy-to-understand way.

Stock assessment data on a Kobe plot over time

Data from RAM Legacy Database

What about stocks that are not assessed?

Fish populations that are not assessed and monitored are much more
likely to be overfished, undermanaged, and unsustainable. This is almost
certainly due to the correlation between a country's financial and
scientific capacity and its ability to effectively manage its fisheries.
The RAM database is much improved, but still has very little data from
Africa and Asia, the two poorest continents. Fish sustainability is most
likely declining in those regions, though capacity-building is underway
in many places.

Fishery management works

The main takeaway from Hilborn et al. 2020 is that fishery science and
management works. If a fishery is assessed, proper decisions can be made
on how to sustainably manage it. This is the roadmap for fisheries
around the world:

Build capacity to assess the stock

Assess the stock

Use the stock assessment to instruct fishery management

[Stock assessment and strong management lead to
sustainability]{.underline}. In 1996 the U.S. reauthorized the
Magnuson-Stevens Act to require rebuilding plans and catch limits which
lowered fishing pressure and raised abundance. Take a look at the Kobe
plot over time of just U.S. stocks:

Gif of US stocks on a Kobe plot over time

U.S. Stocks: Data from Ram Legacy Database

The Common Fisheries Policy of Europe was similarly updated in 2002 and
saw similar results. In 1997, Japan introduced total allowable catches
(TACs) based on stock assessments and saw their TAC-based fisheries
improve. Other countries have followed more recently, notably Chile in
2013.

[Fisheries [management]{.mark}]{.underline} [around the world **[is
working]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [increasing ecosystem
abundance]{.underline} and safeguarding harvests for the future, across
huge swathes of global ocean.

This [piece of good news comes from a new PNAS study]{.underline}, and
it's giving researchers [cause for optimism]{.underline}, because until
now there's been a [dominant belief that fish stocks are
declining]{.underline} in most parts of the planet's oceans. The
comprehensive new paper points out that while overfishing continues to
be a major concern, it certainly doesn't describe the case everywhere.

[Instead]{.underline}, the [study showed]{.underline} that wherever
fisheries are being scientifically monitored, [there has actually been
an [average increase in abundance]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past few
decades. The [researchers put this down to [improved
management]{.mark}]{.underline} in these monitored fisheries -- [which
[allows stocks to recover]{.mark} and replenish]{.underline}, thanks to
measures including catch limits designed to curtail overfishing.

What's more, because [scientifically monitored fisheries make up a
surprising 50% of all the reported catch in the world]{.underline}, this
[paints a much more positive picture of how fisheries may actually be
faring]{.underline} across large parts of the globe.

Zooming in to the country-scale, the researchers drew up an index of
fisheries management around the world to rank countries' efforts. This
revealed that those [regions that have taken steps to intensively manage
their fisheries]{.underline} -- among them, Alaska, the West Coast of
the United States, Norway, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands -- [showed
increasing stock abundance]{.underline}, or fisheries that were at least
improving.

In contrast, in regions that ranked lower on the index because
management is more lax -- like parts of the Mediterranean and North
Africa -- harvest rates are three-fold higher. Consequently, fish stocks
there were only half as abundant as better-managed fisheries, the
analysis showed.

This provided evidence of a concrete link between reduced fishing
pressure -- driven by better management -- and more abundant fisheries.
And, [this is occurring in more places than we think,]{.underline}
[despite the gloomy prognosis on overfishing]{.underline} we've become
accustomed to. "[Fish [stocks]{.mark} are [not]{.mark} all
[declining]{.mark} [around the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They are
increasing in many places]{.underline}, [and **[we already know how to
solve problems]{.mark}** through effective fisheries
management]{.underline}," the researchers said.

Recommended Reading:

[Previous studies]{.underline} on fisheries management [relied on
databases that only looked at about 20% of the world's
catch]{.underline} -- which was too limited to get a realistic gauge on
how effective management efforts really are. The major boon of this
study is that it brings that figure up by 30%, to now cover half the
world's recorded catch.

To make this huge leap, the researchers expanded their analysis to parts
of the world that previously hadn't been covered, gathering together
data from over 880 global fish stocks in all. This helped them rank
countries according to their management efforts.

Yet despite this, due to limited monitoring data the study still
couldn't incorporate huge global fisheries in countries like India,
Indonesia, and China -- which make up between 30 and 40% of the reported
fisheries in the world.

Those should be the focus of our attention in coming years, the
researchers believe. "The major challenge now is to bring fisheries
science methods and sustainability to fisheries that remain largely
unassessed and unmanaged."

"[There are no fish here,]{.underline}" one of the Boy Scouts in our
group said, looking disappointed. I glanced out at the water. He was
right.

We were in Orange Beach, Alabama, for a January campout. [Nine
Scouts]{.underline} from Troop 147 and their parents [had come
here]{.underline} because it was [supposed to be good for
fishing]{.underline}. I was 16 at the time and was one of the oldest
kids in the group. In the end, all the equipment we had bought, all the
research we had done looking for places to fish---none of it panned out.

I was lucky enough to grow up with a dad who knew where great fishing
spots were, and I am grateful every day for those experiences. But for
these kids and their parents, the best spots no longer held the amount
of fish they used to. I wanted to do something about it.

So I did. In April 2022, I founded the [Eagle Reef project]{.underline},
[hoping to increase fish populations]{.underline} so that everyone can
enjoy the water like I did as a kid.

I felt the room light up at the [notion that a group of teenagers with a
small budget could help change the world.]{.underline}

It started with research---lots of research. I learned that [oysters
were dying off in]{.underline} the area [because]{.underline} of
predators [and overfishing]{.underline}. Oyster beds help create
habitats for fish to grow, so fewer oysters means fewer fish. Then I
learned about a biologist who made artificial oyster reefs and used them
to clean up canals and rivers in Florida. The floating reefs sit under
docks and give oysters a place to grow, along with barnacles. Each reef
can act as a nursery for up to 200 baby fish and 300 baby crabs a year.

I'd found it: a [solution to help boost fish populations in our
area]{.underline}. "Why don't we have this in Alabama?" I wondered.

I did the math. I would need [\$30,000 to buy about 100 floating reefs
and]{.underline} then [a team of volunteers to install them
across]{.underline} the Alabama coastline. It would be hard, but I knew
I could pull it off. I organized a group of friends and others to help.

Together we launched TheEagleReef.com so people could find out more
about our project, donate money to support it, and learn how to put the
reefs under their own docks. We raised enough money to buy a bunch of
reefs, and we started installing them along the coast.

A group of us helped place the first two under the Dauphin Island Sea
Lab's dock that June. To my surprise, the mayor of Dauphin Island came
to watch. I felt important. I shook the hand of a mayor, and he was
excited to see me.

[Word spread fast]{.underline}. [More and more people
donated]{.underline} money [and volunteered]{.underline} to put reefs
under their docks. News outlets covered the project. By the end of my
sophomore year, we'd [raised]{.underline} [more than \$50,000 and about
175 reefs were floating across coastal Alabama and Florida]{.underline}.
[People with influence supported the project]{.underline}, and multiple
[nonprofits and big companies]{.underline} [donated]{.underline}. I did
not expect this level of excitement from almost everyone in the
community.

Kids and their families helped build the reefs, including my high school
friend Claire Powers. "The project inspired me and others to change our
outlook on how we can make a difference, especially in our own
backyards," she said.

After I graduated and went to college, I handed off the Eagle Reef
project to Partners for Environmental Progress, an organization that
helps protect the Gulf Coast, and the University of South Alabama's
School of Marine and Environmental Sciences.

On October 25, 2023, kids, parents, local businesspeople, elected
officials, and other supporters came to a ceremony to celebrate the
project's success. "If I can raise \$52,000 and put out more than 175
reefs as a sophomore in high school, imagine what you can do," I told
them. Because after all, we had inspired hundreds of people to step up
and do something special. We had inspired people to act.

I felt the room light up at the notion that a group of teenagers with a
small budget could help change the world. I also challenged them to keep
going and get to 1,000 reefs.

To this day, the [Eagle Reef team is working to make that vision a
reality.]{.underline}

#### Potatoes thump fish wars and solve all food impacts better

Tasteful Selections: Bite-size **Potatoes 24**, Expert knowledge in all
things potatoes, 4/1/24, "The Sustainability Superstar: Why Potatoes
Trump Other Fresh Produce,"
https://www.tastefulselections.com/regenerative-agriculture/, Troh

[[In the realm of sustainable eating, one often-overlooked hero emerges:
the **potato**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite its humble appearance, this
versatile tuber packs a powerful punch when it comes to sustainability.
Let's dive into why [[potatoes stand out as a more eco-friendly choice
compared to other]{.mark}]{.underline} fresh produce
[[options]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[[Efficient Resource Use]{.underline}]{.mark}

Potatoes are champions of efficiency in resource use. Unlike some crops
that demand extensive irrigation, fertilization, and land, potatoes
thrive with minimal inputs. Their shallow root system and quick growth
mean they require less water and nutrients compared to many other
vegetables, making them a more sustainable choice for farmers and the
environment.

[[Reduced Carbon Footprint]{.underline}]{.mark}

When it comes to carbon emissions, potatoes have a smaller footprint
compared to other fresh produce items. They typically don't require as
much energy-intensive processing or transportation, especially when
sourced locally. Choosing [[potatoes]{.underline}]{.mark} over imported
or highly processed produce can **[[significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** associated with food production and
distribution.

[[Versatility and Minimal Waste]{.underline}]{.mark}

Potatoes are incredibly versatile, offering endless culinary
possibilities. From mashed potatoes to potato salads, fries to soups,
there's a potato dish for every craving. This versatility means fewer
ingredients are needed to create satisfying meals, reducing overall food
waste. Additionally, [[potatoes have a longer shelf
life]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to many other fresh produce items,
minimizing spoilage and further cutting down on waste.

[[Soil Health and Biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}

Potato farming practices, when done sustainably, can benefit soil health
and biodiversity. Crop rotation, cover cropping, and minimal tillage
practices can improve soil structure, enhance nutrient cycling, and
promote beneficial microbial activity. By fostering healthier soils,
potato farming contributes to more resilient and sustainable

[[Chicken]{.underline}]{.mark} was the **[[only major
protein]{.underline}]{.mark}** category [[to see]{.mark} any
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline} as [shoppers swapped to **cheaper**
proteins]{.underline}.

[Sales of every meat, **[fish]{.mark}** and poultry]{.underline}
category [apart from chicken]{.underline} have [plunged [over]{.mark}
the past 12 weeks]{.underline}, new data from Kantar has revealed.

[Chicken]{.underline} was the [only major protein category]{.underline}
to [see any growth]{.underline} over the 12 weeks to 12 June, latest
data reveals: total meat, [fish]{.underline} and poultry [[**fell 5.2%**
year on year]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**11.3**%]{.mark} versus two years
ago.]{.underline}

[Chicken sales stayed in the black]{.underline}, but only grew by 0.6%.
Kantar put this down to the rising popularity of fresh processed
poultry, which grew at a "healthy" 2.4% as shoppers swapped to cheaper
proteins. Total chicken volumes were down 9.7%.

"In previous periods where there has been a squeeze on living standards,
there can be shifts in demand for different proteins," said Meat
Promotion Wales data analyst Glesni Philips.

"[All proteins are experiencing increases in their average
prices]{.underline}, but **[[fish remains]{.mark} the [most
expensive]{.mark} protein]{.underline}**, followed by lamb, and ,
[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the [biggest price
[rises]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[chicken remains]{.mark} the
[cheapest]{.mark} protein."]{.underline}**

"[Product choice]{.underline} is the [main way shoppers]{.underline} are
[choosing to manage inflation]{.underline} now, and so [shoppers are
switching]{.underline} between cuts in order [to save
money]{.underline}," Phillips added.

Beef, pork, lamb and [[fish]{.mark} [sales]{.mark} all
[fell]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} 7.7%, 5.9%, 14.4%
and **[[8.0%]{.underline}]{.mark}** in value respectively. [Volume
[losses]{.mark}]{.underline} (of 13.7%, 10.6%, 23.7% and
**[[11.6%]{.underline}]{.mark}** respectively) were [steeper thanks to
inflation.]{.underline}

Tony Goodger, head of marketing and communications at the Association of
Independent Meat Suppliers, suggested red meat could [learn from the
poultry sector]{.underline} by, "looking at the amount of NPD which the
chicken has undertaken over the last few years and seeing how their
product can follow suit.

"We are also seeing the return of bundle deals with these often
structured around recent NPD-led poultry products."

It was difficult to compare the current data with the past two years due
to the pandemic influencing shopper habits, argued Rebecca Veale, senior
policy advisor in the NPA.

However, the continued fall in consumption was causing "uncertainty in
the industry", said BMPA CEO Nick Allen.

It was not an "anti-meat" stance from consumers as other sectors were in
a similar situation, he stressed.

"[Everyone is just trying to cut down where they can]{.underline}."

However, the situation was being exacerbated by production issues amid
the labour crisis and retailers cutting lines. This made it harder for
both retailers and producers to inspire consumers and drive sales, he
said.

The NPA's Veale added: "Knowing that consumers like to buy British pork,
we do not believe that any reduction in consumption should displace
British product and call on retail and foodservice to campion British
meat and pay a fair price for it.

"Campaigns from AHDB to promote pork as a healthy and nutritious source
of protein are fantastic and we support them but in order for British
pork to remain on the shelves, a fair price needs to be paid to
producers."

and essential micronutrients -- calcium, iron, zinc -- that support

2.2. Molecular genetic tools

The advent of [[affordable]{.mark} and more accessible molecular
[genetics tools]{.mark}]{.underline} [and technologies]{.underline}
(Willette et al., 2014) has [[opened opportunities for
**modernizing**]{.mark} **marine fisheries
[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Traditional DNA barcoding is one
such tool]{.underline} that has both been [**rigorously vetted and
widely adopted**]{.underline} late in seafood supply chain [to detect
seafood substitution]{.underline}, including in market and
restaurant-focused studies (Naaum et al., 2016; Luque and Josh Donlan,
2019; Willette et al., 2021a). Yet, [traditional DNA barcoding methods
can be limiting]{.underline}; requiring direct, individual sampling of
fish tissues which is not practical early in the supply chain where
thousands of fish may be transported and processed at once. The
[emergence of environmental DNA]{.underline} (eDNA) methods [helps
circumvent the need for direct sampling of fish tissue]{.underline} by
instead targeting the remnant DNA and metabolic waste left behind in
their environment, which can then be used to identify multiple present
species simultaneously (Deiner et al., 2017). For example, Willette et
al. (2021b) [demonstrated the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for in
situ profiling]{.underline} of [fish species composition]{.underline}
from the [meltwater in the fish holds of industrial and artisanal
fishing vessels]{.underline}, revealing more diverse taxa than generally
reported by the vessel's crew. Such [[applications]{.underline}]{.mark}
would not only [[complement existing surveillance
tools]{.underline}]{.mark} but could [have a transformative effect in
achieving unambiguous species identification]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} fish [supply chain traceability.]{.underline}

[[New applicatio]{.underline}ns]{.mark} of the use of eDNA for
addressing a wide range of scientific and management questions [[emerge
every day]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its [potential use for supporting
fisheries management]{.underline} by supplying abundance indices is
[increasingly explored]{.underline} (Rourke et al., 2022). However,
numerous methodological challenges still need to be overcome and
promising novel approaches remain to be tested (see review in Yao et
al., 2022). One common result across a diversity of case studies is the
high vertical resolution of eDNA signals in stratified marine ecosystems
and the overall positive relationship of eDNA derived abundance indices
with traditional sampling methods such as trawling, visual counts,
echo-sounders, etc. (Rourke et al., 2022). Recent progress has further
been made in applying molecular genetics to estimate absolute abundance
of exploited fish populations based on genotyping fish tissues samples,
identifying related individuals, and applying advanced statistical
methods (Bravington et al., 2016; Trenkel et al., 2022). This approach
also provided novel insights into demographic connectivity and fine
scale population structure, which are essential for both conservation
and sustainable exploitation (Hillary et al., 2018; Trenkel et al.,
2022). Further, applications of eDNA metabarcoding can also be used to
detect rare or threatened species captured as by-catch (Burgess et al.,
2018), catalog fish gut content in diet analyses (Leray et al., 2013),
and spot instances of farmed fish in wild stocks (Aguirre-Pabon et al.,
2015).

Since its earliest application in French wetlands to detect and identify
invasive American bullfrogs (Ficetola et al., 2008), [eDNA
[methods]{.mark} have [gained traction]{.mark} as a tool [for]{.mark}
the **[surveillance]{.mark}** and monitoring of
biodiversity]{.underline}. This **[includes [in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** where federal agencies have launched
in-house eDNA research labs (Morisette et al., 2021) and have been
successful in getting eDNA genetic findings admitted as evidence in
litigation (N.D. Illinois 2010, App. Voices v US Dept of Interior 4th
Cir Court 2022). This [technology is now]{.underline} [undergoing a
transition]{.underline} from research-focused exploratory trials [to
more routine use by fisheries agencies]{.underline} (Aylagas et al.,
2018; Laroche et al., 2018), with the next necessary step the creation
of national and international policies (Lodge, 2022).

2.3. [Vessel monitoring systems]{.underline}

[[Vessel monitoring systems]{.mark} (VM]{.underline}S) are a [technology
that [contributed to i]{.mark}mproving MCS]{.underline},
**[[implementing restricted areas for fishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and [showing a more reliable estimate of fishing effort]{.underline}
than before (e.g., Murawski et al., 2005; Mills et al., 2007). [VMS are
designed to automatically acquire and transmit the position, speed and
heading]{.underline} of the vessel. Because the reporting interval is
mandatory (currently every hour for vessels above 12 meters in the
European Union (EU)), and the [VMS equipment cannot be switched
off]{.underline}, any interruption of VMS signal reception can raise an
alert in the MCS room of the flag state and may be analyzed as potential
attempt to fraud. The VMS data set is encoded and sent over satellite
link to the only authorized recipients. The flag state is the primary
recipient, then sharing on "need to know" basis with coastal states or
Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs).

Because of its **[[high level of data security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[VMS is fit for]{.mark} the [purpose]{.mark} of fishing effort
estimate]{.underline}, distant control and possible at-sea inspections.
Most fishing nations now operate a VMS to monitor their industrial fleet
and many are considering monitoring more vessels to include small scale
fisheries with cellular VMS (Burgos et al., 2013). The VMS data link is
also used to transmit the electronic logbook (also called Electronic
Reporting System or ERS), which becomes a mandatory requirement in many
states. The electronic logbook is a computer or tablet application used
by the ship master to report each fishing trip details (start, end,
capture species and quantities, possible bycatch, quantities in hold
when entering or exiting a zone). These data are used for quota
management and fishing effort statistics.

In the EU, monitoring and control of the Common Fisheries Policy is
based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 which requires fishing
vessels above 12 meters to carry a VMS and report their catches via an
electronic logbook. The VMS systems have been adapted for small scale
artisanal boats, with cellular connectivity and solar panels (STARFISH,
2020). All EU member states today operate a [[Fisheries Monitoring
Center]{.mark} (FMC) for their national fleet]{.underline}, to manage a
vessel register, [[monitor]{.mark} the [fishing
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, [compare with the licences and
authorizations]{.underline}, **[[detect suspicious
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}** and exchange data with the European
Commission and regional fisheries management organizations. [Data
exchanges through the UN Flux format and cybersecurity are becoming
standards]{.underline} in a context [where fisheries irregularities can
[lead]{.mark} [to **heavy penalties**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2.4. [[Automatic identification systems]{.underline}]{.mark}

A[utomatic identification system (AIS) is another
[technology]{.mark}]{.underline} which has [[progressively been
installed]{.underline}]{.mark} on most vessels above tonnage thresholds
under the SOLAS regulation V/19 as a collision avoidance system
supporting safety of life at sea. Like VMS, [AIS also transmits the
vessel position and movements]{.underline} but more frequently and in
open broadcast format, so that everyone with an appropriate AIS receiver
can pick up the messages. While the initial concept allowed reception in
close proximity only (ship-to-ship to avoid collision) or through
institutional coastal systems (port authorities), the [AIS usage has
greatly change]{.underline}d with introduction of web-based AIS data
providers and commercial satellite-AIS constellations. These systems now
make the vessels movements a commodity which can be purchased by any
entity, including fishing companies to monitor their competitors,
shipping companies to evaluate the traffic in ports etc. Some fishers
prefer not to disclose the best fishing grounds and turn off the system,
some others engaged in illegal activities may switch off (Welch et al.,
2022) or purposely tamper their AIS device to send false identifiers or
positions (called AIS spoofing; Androjna et al., 2021).

The [reference data portal providing free access to global AIS data
sets]{.underline} is the Global Fishing Watch (Kroodsma et al., 2018),
which [acquires AIS from satellite operators]{.underline}, [publishes
them and supports data analytics]{.underline} **[[revealing large scale
IUU activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The portal also shows that AIS
tracking is not evenly distributed over the planet. However, the portal
gives only a partial view of actual fishing since most small fishing
vessels do not have an AIS, or not an AIS model able to be received by
satellite.

"IUU Fishing" = Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing

2.5. [Remote electronic monitoring]{.underline}

**[Remote electronic monitoring ([REM]{.mark}]{.underline}**) is a
[[technology of interest in **deterrence of IUU
fishing**]{.underline}]{.mark} at sea [and appraisal of incidental
catches]{.underline} such as marine mammals (Kindt-Larsen et al., 2012).
[REM consists of a complete VMS, including CCTVs, sensors on winches,
conveyors and freezers]{.underline}. The best AIS or VMS will not tell
which species and quantity is actually captured, and the real figures
may differ from those declared in the electronic reports. The
[[monitoring of bycatch]{.mark} is a [prime example]{.mark}]{.underline}
[demonstrating the capacity]{.underline} of REM **[[to deter IUU
fishing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Bycatch represents the non-targeted
organisms captured while fishing for specific species. It could be
tempting to discard it at sea to save limited hold space for target
species, or to avoid a complete fisheries closure in the case of mixed
fisheries where the vessel has reached its quota for a given species
(the choke species) and cannot take the risk to continue fishing for the
other species. [Bycatch is by nature underestimated and
underreported]{.underline}. In 2019, FAO evaluated discards at 9.1
million tons or 10% of total catches, and fisheries may interact with 20
million individuals of endangered species (sea birds, turtles, sharks
etc.; Pérez et al., 2019). [Many states have consequently implemented
landing obligations for all bycatch]{.underline}, but these measures are
complex to monitor unless deploying observers to monitor the deck
activities. Where onboard observers were mandatory, [their replacement
by cameras has been increasingly considered and implemented]{.underline}
when COVID pandemic prevented boarding of observers. Presently less than
1% of global fisheries are subject to REM. REM is a complex system to
adapt to each individual vessel, and it may generate substantial amount
of information, for which artificial intelligence will be necessary to
extract relevant events from hours of video footage (Monkman et al.,
2019), [yet another [technology]{.mark} with the [potential to

What can other governments do to fight IUU fishing?

Roles and [responsibilities for a government vary depending on its
relationship]{.underline} to the vessel and the catch. A vessel's flag
state has exclusive authority over it on the high seas, including with
regard to matters such as labor standards and ship safety. Therefore,
[[flag states]{.underline}]{.mark} must [[ensure]{.mark} that
[regulations are in place]{.mark} and enforced to [deter IUU
fishing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and associated crimes from
occurring on their vessels. Ignoring the duties of being a flag state
can, and often does, allow illegal activity to take place. In addition,
there are particularly concerning cases where flag states willfully abet
IUU perpetrators by encouraging or assisting vessels that encroach on
sovereign waters and EEZs of other nations or intimidate local
fishermen.

[[Port states]{.underline}]{.mark} also can [play a significant role by
[block]{.mark}ing [vessels]{.mark} engaged [in IUU
fishing]{.mark}]{.underline} from using their ports and landing their
catches. [Governments have a framework to do so pursuant to the
Agreement on Port State Measures]{.underline}, a [[UN treaty]{.mark}
that came into force in 2016]{.underline} and was the [[first
binding]{.mark} international [agreement]{.mark} that specifically
**[targets IUU fishing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Approximately
[**[one-third of]{.mark} the [world's countries]{.mark}** [are party to
it]{.mark},]{.underline} but UN members should collectively work to
increase that number.

Meanwhile, [coastal states]{.underline} have a responsibility to assist
in curbing IUU fishing. They are [responsible for conservation and
management of the ocean resources]{.underline} to which they have
sovereign rights (within their EEZs). Finally, market states, where the
fish are sold, should work to ensure that their seafood is coming from
legal, legitimate sources.

What other multilateral efforts are there?

[[IUU]{.mark} fishing can **[only]{.mark}** be [combated by]{.mark} a
**[whole-of-world approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}, presenting an
opportunity for state-to-state cooperation. [Regional fisheries
management organizations are working with the International Maritime
Organization to boost accountability requirements]{.underline} aboard
commercial fishing vessels across the globe. [Other]{.underline}
international bodies and nongovernmental organizations ([[NGOs]{.mark})
are [contributing]{.mark} to the fight as well]{.underline}.
[[Interpol's]{.underline}]{.mark} Project Scale **[is [succeeding in
catching]{.mark} much [illegal fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Technology initiatives]{.underline} such as the Pew Charitable Trusts'
Oversea Ocean Monitor and Global Fishing Watch's satellite-based
platforms [have been highly effective tools for spotting suspect
activity]{.underline} across large spans of the ocean. And NGOs such as
the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and Greenpeace, which [operate on
contributions from private donors with vessels crewed by
volunteers]{.underline}, also help [build maritime domain
awareness.]{.underline}

The [[world needs to **collectively** continue to fight]{.mark} the
scourge of [IUU]{.mark} fishing]{.underline} in order to protect
sensitive marine environments and food sustainability, prevent
irreparable damage to coastal economies, counter corruption and
associated criminal activity, and uphold the sovereignty and security of

[In a major milestone]{.underline} in the global fight [against illegal,
unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing]{.underline}, today
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} -- which has the [**[world's largest
fishing fleets]{.underline}** -- [joined a]{.underline}
]{.mark}[landmark [treaty to ensure]{.mark} that **[only legally caught
fish move through the world's ports.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's ([FAO's]{.mark})
[Agreement]{.mark} on Port State Measures]{.underline} (also known as
the Port State Measures Agreement or PSMA), which entered into force in
2016, [is the [only]{.mark} legally binding international
[treaty]{.mark} specifically [targeting IUU
fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [aims to stop illicitly caught
fish]{.underline} [from being landed and sold]{.underline} on the
international market by requiring authorities to implement more
stringent controls at port. [[China's]{.mark} long-awaited
accession]{.underline} to the treaty [[signals]{.underline}]{.mark} that
this country, with a significant interest in global fisheries, [is
**[ready to take on a larger role]{.mark}** in preventing IUU
activity.]{.underline}

Fishing vessels, many with dark hulls with white wheelhouses, crowd
together on a cloudy, gray day at the port of Busan, South Korea.
Thousands of blue and red cargo boxes are stacked behind the ships, with
large blue and red lifts. Skyscrapers and the hills of the city are seen
in the distance.

[IUU fishing accounts for]{.underline} up to \$23 billion worth of
seafood annually, or [1 in 5 wild-caught fish]{.underline}, according to
the FAO. The activity harms law-abiding fishing fleets and steals food
and revenue from coastal communities around the world, many of which
rely on healthy fisheries to survive. [IUU fishing also puts crews at
risk]{.underline} and [damages the marine environment]{.underline}
because illegal fishers often ignore other laws, such as those governing
labour standards and conservation.

Research commissioned by Pew has identified [[China]{.mark} as
[having]{.mark} the [top 10 busiest ports]{.mark} in the
world]{.underline} based on the total number of fishing and carrier
vessel visits. That same research also ranked
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} as one of the countries in Asia with the
[[highest risk]{.mark} in terms of its [ability to effectively combat
IUU fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} due mainly to low governance
levels.

While the PSMA [predominantly focuses on foreign-flagged fishing vessels
visiting]{.underline} [another country's ports]{.underline}, the treaty
[also contains a critical requirement]{.underline} that Partie[s
investigate their own vessels when wrongdoing is suspected]{.underline}
[and punish them]{.underline} if it's confirmed. To date, most countries
have focused on implementation as it relates to foreign vessels, which
has led to many distant-water fishing vessels returning to domestic
ports to avoid PSMA-triggered inspections in foreign ports.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [has both the largest distant-water
and domestic fleets]{.underline} in the world and has **[[approached
PSMA adoption very seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [can help change
that narrative]{.underline}.

[In China]{.underline}, [over 99% of port visits are
domestic]{.underline}, which includes many vessels from its large
distant-water fleet returning home to land catch. If
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} conducts equal oversight of domestic and
foreign vessel visits, it [[would have a]{.mark} **[significant
impact]{.mark}** given the high number of visits to Chinese
ports.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} could also [take additional steps to improve
oversight]{.underline} of its fisheries. China can join its fellow
Parties in adopting and making use of the Global Information Exchange
System, which allows PSMA member countries to share real-time data, such
as port inspection reports, to inform risk assessments.

Within China, the government should work to ensure effective cooperation
among relevant ministries, such as those that oversee fisheries and
transport. The [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} had [**[already
begun]{.mark} these [efforts]{.mark}** as part of its work to accede to
the PSMA]{.underline}, and such [coordination]{.underline} is [required
throughout the stages of implementation]{.underline} -- from designating
ports to accept foreign vessels to ensuring capacity at those ports to
implement controls, such as vessel inspections. China should build on
this work by standardizing processes and systems to share information
and resources for strong PSMA implementation.

[China's adoption of the PSMA is a welcome development]{.underline} in
international fisheries governance. Fish stocks continue to decline
worldwide, a trend that can be reversed only through improved fisheries
management, including identifying and responding to IUU fishing.
[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[massive]{.mark} [fishing fleets and
busy ports]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[China can play a **key
role**]{.mark} in addressing IUU activity and, by extension, help
strengthen port controls around the world.]{.underline}

China's importance

[United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
([FAO]{.mark}]{.underline}) data [[illustrates]{.mark} the
[**staggeringly large role** China plays]{.mark} in the global seafood
industry]{.underline}. [[China is]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[world's
largest producer]{.mark}** of aquatic animal products]{.underline},
generating [35% of the world's seafood]{.underline} in 2020. This
includes 15% of global capture (non-aquaculture) fisheries, more than
the second and third-ranked countries combined. [China]{.underline} is
also the [[**world's largest consumer**]{.mark} of aquatic
foods,]{.underline} alone consuming 36% of the world's total in 2019. It
is the top seafood importer and exporter by volume. China also has the
[**[world's largest fishing fleet]{.underline}**,]{.mark} with [an
estimated 564,000 vessels]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
**[[world's largest distant-water fishing fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[with]{.underline} nearly [3,000 vessel]{.underline}s --- **[[more than
ten times that of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [or]{.mark} the
[E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion]{.underline}** --- and potentially many
more.

Therefore, **[[Chinese participation is critical]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to the global effort to counter IUU fishing]{.underline}, and 2023 saw
China take several actions. In June, [China accepted the World Trade
Organization's Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies]{.underline}, which
[protects against harmful subsidies]{.underline}, including for vessels
engaged in IUU fishing. [China's acceptance coincided with changing its
subsidies]{.underline} from fuel-centric to focused on fisheries
stewardship. In addition, [[China's]{.mark} 14th Five-Year [Plan]{.mark}
for Fishery Development]{.underline} [promotes aquaculture]{.underline}
[while limiting catch]{.underline} and shrinking fleets, which, if
successful, may **[also [reduce IUU fishing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
[Chinese [government]{.mark} also claims to have [levied over \$137
million in fines]{.mark} for illegal fishing]{.underline}. Taken in
context with statements from President Xi Jinping, [these actions align
with broader Chinese environmental and economic efforts]{.underline},
and likely [represent [China seeking a greater leadership role
in]{.mark} [global maritime policy]{.mark}]{.underline} --- from which
it could shape rules in its interest. That said, it remains to be seen
if these changes are merely symbolic or reflect a genuine effort to
counter IUU fishing.

Moving forward, China should follow through on its rhetoric regarding
sustainability and regulate its fisheries while supporting international
efforts to counter IUU fishing. It should join the FAO's Port State
Measures Agreement, which seeks to prevent IUU fishing vessels from
landing their catches. Building on a 2023 agreement with South Korea,
China should also require its fishing vessels to consistently transmit
their positions via the internationally recognized automatic
identification system (AIS) and prosecute those who disable it.

Maritime domain awareness

AIS is crucial because it allows nations, fisheries management
organizations, and non-governmental entities to determine where vessels
are operating. It can also be used to assess whether they are actively
fishing, offloading to a support vessel, or just transiting. This
supports maritime domain awareness, which the International Maritime
Organization defines as "effective understanding of anything associated
with the maritime domain that could impact security, safety, the economy
or the marine environment." In other words, eliminating IUU fishing
requires a clear, real-time picture of where fishing vessels are and
what they're doing, at all times, everywhere in the world.

Achieving this comprehensive picture on a global scale was, until
recently, impossible. Modern technologies have enabled dramatic
advancements in maritime domain awareness. SeaVision, for example,
combines AIS information with satellite-based synthetic aperture radar
(SAR), coastal radar, visual and infrared imagery, and radio frequency
data to present a more comprehensive picture of maritime activity.
Sensor fusion can be used to detect and track vessels that have disabled
their AIS, potentially to pursue nefarious activity.

Artificial intelligence algorithms have been developed to process SAR
data and now serve as a key component of SeaVision and other maritime
domain awareness tools. Other efforts, such as NATO's Digital Ocean
Vision, seek to combine satellite-based sensors with those of autonomous
systems to further improve maritime domain awareness, and autonomous
vehicle manufacturers are marketing their technologies as a means to
counter IUU fishing.

Nations should develop maritime domain awareness technologies,
incorporating more advanced sensors and algorithms, to identify IUU
fishing. Detecting illegal fishing, however, is only one element of
prosecuting its perpetrators. Effective action requires the capacity to
respond rapidly when IUU fishing is detected, a function that must be
further developed and augmented through partnerships.

Hope for 2024

[Coordinated U.S. actions, [China's adoption]{.mark} of the Agreement on
Fisheries Subsidies, and multilateral efforts]{.underline} like the IUU
Fishing Action Alliance Pledge [[represent **significant steps**]{.mark}
toward countering IUU fishing]{.underline} in 2023. They [represent a
culmination of growing international awareness]{.underline} and pressure
and must be expanded. International cooperation, especially involving
China, is critical. So too is combining maritime domain awareness tools
with the capacity to respond. With these pieces in place, the world
stands poised to finally make a measurable dent in IUU fishing in 2024.

## Bioweapons

#### No bioweapons, even from AI.

[Bioweapons use and bioterrorism has been, historically, extremely
rare]{.underline}. This is not a reason to ignore AI or be sanguine
about the risks it poses, but managing those risks is rarely aided by
hype.

AI-enabled bioweapons? Much of the security discussion to date has
focused on large language models (LLM), which power AI chatbots such as
ChatGPT, and the potential these tools and models have for enabling
biological weapons. As one recent piece put it, AI and bioweapons are
the latest security obsession. OpenAI, which developed ChatGPT,
stress-tested the chatbot for biosecurity concerns and publicly released
a "system card" in spring 2023 addressing the risks as the company saw
them. The company claimed that "a key risk driver is GPT-4's ability to
generate publicly accessible but difficult-to-find information,
shortening the time users spend on research and compiling this
information in a way that is understandable to a non-expert user." The
stress test indicated that "information generated by the model is most
likely to be useful for individuals and non-state actors who do not have
access to formal scientific training."

A few weeks following the release of OpenAI's system card, the
prestigious journal Science published a news story on a thought
experiment conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Researchers had asked a set of undergraduate students to find out, with
the help of a large language model, how to create and order a dangerous
virus capable of unleashing a pandemic.

Within an hour, the chatbots had suggested a list of four potential
pandemic pathogens. In some cases, the chatbots had pointed to genetic
mutations reported in the literature to increase transmission. The large
language models also described how the viruses could be created from
synthetic DNA using reverse genetics and supplied the names of DNA
synthesis companies judged unlikely to screen orders, identified
detailed protocols and how to troubleshoot them, and recommended that
anyone lacking the skills engage other organizations to overcome these
challenges.

The experiment was held up as an example of how AI could make it easier
for someone with evil intentions and no science background to gain the
know-how to devise a biological weapon.

A slew of reports followed the Science news piece, helping to make
policymakers at the highest levels aware of the potential security
implications of the AI--bio intersection. Ahead of a UK-hosted summit on
AI safety in November 2023, then-British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak
warned that AI could make it easier to build biological weapons. The
political and tech leaders in attendance echoed that concern in a
declaration emphasizing the potential catastrophic harm from AI and
biotechnology. Around the same time, the US Biden administration issued
a landmark executive order on AI that included a plan to probe how
emerging AI systems might aid malicious actors in plots to develop
bioweapons.

AI and Bioweapons: critical assessments. While AI appears destined to
have a major impact on a wide range of industries and activities, both
caution and skepticism are warranted. The flood of shoddy AI generated
material in search results has been referred to as "slop" by some
commentators. Others go further, and claim large language model's
errors, or "hallucinations," should more accurately be called
"bullshit".

[Between the hype]{.underline} and dismissal is a more complex reality.

For all the doomsaying, [there are]{.underline} actually [many
uncertainties in how AI will affect bioweapons and the wider biosecurity
arena]{.underline}. While AI can be used to predict and design new toxic
compounds, proteins that have harmful effects, or enhancements that make
pathogens even more harmful, [the leap from scientific theory to
bioweapons]{.underline} reality has [rarely occurred and no deliberate
use of disease has had a major impact on a conflict.]{.underline}

Large [language models]{.underline} like ChatGPT may make it easier for
non-experts to access dual-use knowledge and thereby lower barriers to
intentional misuse, but [much, if not all, of this information is
already available to anyone]{.underline} with above average search
capabilities [on the internet]{.underline}. This is not a limitation
only in the bioweapons area: In July 2023, an assessment of [AI's
capabilities]{.underline} by UK intelligence experts concluded it was
the [equivalent to an extremely junior analyst]{.underline} and the
technology served as a basic productivity assistant.

What is notable in assessments of [large language models]{.underline}
and their advantages and limitations is that they [get things wrong,
suffer from bias, can oversimplify]{.underline} complex
[relationships]{.underline}, and [fail to take into account the social,
political, organizational and technology]{.underline} context [that
shape]{.underline} decisions around [biological weapons development and
use]{.underline}. Like all datasets, the information within them must be
sufficiently large and representative to reduce bias. There is the
[garbage-in-garbage out]{.underline} challenge: High-quality data is
essential to efficient AI training, and such training is becoming very
expensive.

In addition, within biology and the life sciences, data availability can
be restricted for all kinds of reasons, including licensing policies,
ethical and security considerations, and proprietary rights. The
availability of high-quality biological data sets is not a given;
neither is the completeness of biological data sets. Data and data sets
used to train AI have been of variable quality and completeness, and
scientists still need to evaluate computational results and validate
them experimentally.

Knowledge and information alone are also insufficient: Evidence from
state biological weapons programs and terrorist plots and attacks using
biological weapons show that the weapons development process is anything
but straightforward. Mass casualty biological weapons are not easy and
cheap to produce, and claims of cheap, easy and simple present a
distorted and even apocalyptic picture of the threat that is far from
realistic.

Biological and toxin weapons exist or could exist on a spectrum from the
relatively simple, such as ricin distributed by mail, to potentially
more sophisticated weapons, which are often portrayed as genetically
modified pathogens able to kill millions. Experts and policymakers
conducting tabletop exercises often feature worst case scenarios, with
two examples being an exercise in 2001 called Dark Winter that involved
smallpox and another in 2021 featuring genetically engineered mpox
virus.

Many analysts and policymakers stress that pathogens and toxins can be
easily isolated from nature or obtained commercially because they also
have legitimate commercial or pharmaceutical uses. They point out that
lots of the equipment used in biology and the life sciences is
essentially dual-use in nature and can be readily acquired, while
scientific publications provide ample descriptions of experiments and
techniques that many believe can be easily replicated. While such claims
are not incorrect, beyond some pathogens at the relatively simple end of
the spectrum, the unique nature of bioweapons materials creates steep
challenges beyond simply acquiring pathogenic or toxin material; these
include processing, handling, and producing sufficient amounts of a
pathogen. Unlike nuclear weapons, which rely on materials with
physically predictable properties, [bioweapons are based on living
organisms]{.underline} and living organisms evolve. [They are prone to
developing new properties]{.underline} and are [sensitive to
environmental]{.underline} and handling [uncertainties]{.underline}. The
behavior of living organisms, [therefore, is unpredictable throughout
all stages of development and use as a weapon.]{.underline}

### AT: Bioweapons\-\--No Terrorist\-\--1NC

#### Terrorists are deterred post-Covid.

**Ackerman et al. 22 -** Gary A. Ackerman is an Associate Professor and
Associate Dean for Research in the College of Emergency Preparedness,

(Gary A., 8/11, "Why COVID probably hasn't helped bioterrorists, despite
fears"
https://thebulletin.org/2022/08/why-covid-probably-hasnt-helped-bioterrorists-despite-fears/)
akshaj

Could COVID have changed the equation? Aum and its ilk aside,
[terrorists haven't shown]{.underline} a great deal of [interest in
bioweapons]{.underline}. But could the pandemic have changed their
views? Certainly, many analysts and media organizations have explored
this concern. For example, Vox recently ran a lengthy piece on "Why
experts are terrified of a human-made pandemic" arguing that COVID is a
warning of what's to come: pathogens enhanced with gain-of-function
research and DNA synthesis improving access to pathogenic material.
Axios wrote about how the coronavirus reawakened bioweapons fears. An
op-ed in the Los Angeles Times argued that COVID shows world leaders the
harm bioweapons can cause.

The fears are well-justified in at least one regard: Thanks to
scientific advances, the technical barriers to bioterrorism are going
down. But COVID isn't playing a big role there.

As a technical matter, [COVID's bolstering of]{.underline} terrorists'
[abilities to acquire biological weapons is likely modest at
best]{.underline}. The main potential concern is the proliferation of
medical and public health resources aimed at combatting COVID and
whether any of these can be reappropriated to serve bioterrorism
schemes. In most cases, the answer is no. Nonetheless, new laboratories
might create opportunities to steal equipment or pathogens. [Terrorists
might]{.underline} also be able to more readily [acquire
skills]{.underline} related to handling pathogenic material through the
rapid training that occurred to meet pandemic needs. But these [effects
are likely minimal.]{.underline}

The pandemic has caused millions of deaths, a lot of illness, and huge
economic and societal disruption. It has also shown the limits of
vaccinations: 20 percent of Americans still remain hesitant to get their
shots. Pandemic-prompted responses may also be less effective for
non-contagious agents like Bacillus anthracis. For example, masking is
unlikely to be effective response absent an unlikely early warning. Yet,
it's [not at all clear that a terrorist group will see new
opportunities]{.underline} for bioweapons based on how society has
[responded to COVID.]{.underline}

Contrary to fears, [the way]{.underline} some [governments have
responded]{.underline} to the pandemic might [deter]{.underline} rather
than encourage would-be [bioterrorists]{.underline}. For example, the
experience of the Operation Warp Speed program in the United States
showed that [governments can rapidly develop, disseminate, and update a
novel vaccine]{.underline}. Efforts to bolster [early warning systems,
like waste-water]{.underline} surveillance programs, may likewise make a
bioweapon less effective.

## Radioactive

akshaj

The [radioactivity of nuclear waste]{.underline} naturally decays, and
[has a finite radiotoxic lifetime]{.underline}. Within a period of
1,000-10,000 years, the radioactivity of HLW decays to that of the
originally mined ore. Its [hazard]{.underline} then [depends on how
concentrated it is]{.underline}. By comparison, [other industrial
wastes]{.underline} (e.g. heavy metals, such as cadmium and mercury)
[remain hazardous indefinitely]{.underline}.

Most [nuclear waste]{.underline} produced [is hazardous]{.underline},
due to its radioactivity, [for only a few tens of years]{.underline} and
is routinely disposed of in near-surface disposal facilities (see
above). Only a small volume of nuclear waste (\~3% of the total) is
long-lived and highly radioactive and requires isolation from the
environment for many thousands of years.

International conventions define what is hazardous in terms of radiation
dose, and national regulations limit allowable doses accordingly.
[Well-developed industry technology ensures that these regulations are
met so that any hazardous waste is handled in a way it poses no risk to
human health or the environment. Waste is converted into a stable form
that is suitable for disposal]{.underline}. In the case of HLW, a
multi-barrier approach, combining containment and geological disposal,
ensures isolation of the waste from people and the environment for
thousands of years.

From the outset, there has been a strong awareness of the potential
hazard of both nuclear criticality and release of radioactive materials
from generating electricity with nuclear power. As in other industries,
[[the]{.mark} design and [operation of nuclear power plants aims to
**minimize**]{.mark} the likelihood of [accidents, and **avoid** major
human consequences when they occur]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[There have
been two]{.mark} major reactor [accidents]{.mark} [in the history
of]{.mark} civil [nuclear power]{.mark} --]{.underline}
[Chernobyl](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident)
and [Fukushima
Daiichi](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident).
Chernobyl involved an intense fire without provision for containment,
and Fukushima Daiichi severely tested the containment, allowing some
release of radioactivity. [These are the only major accidents to have
occurred in over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear
power operation in 36 countries.]{.underline} [[The evidence over six
decades shows]{.mark} [that]{.mark} nuclear power is a safe means of
generating electricity. [The risk of accidents in nuclear power plants
is low and declining]{.mark}. [The **consequences** of an accident or
terrorist attack **are** **minimal**]{.mark} compared with other
commonly accepted risks]{.underline}. Radiological effects on people of
any radioactive releases [can be avoided]{.underline}. In relation to
nuclear power, safety is closely linked with security, and in the
nuclear field also with safeguards. Some distinctions apply: Safety
focuses on unintended conditions or events leading to radiological
releases from authorized activities. It relates mainly to intrinsic
problems or hazards. [Security focuses on]{.underline} the intentional
[misuse]{.underline} of nuclear or other radioactive materials by
non-state elements to cause harm. It relates mainly to external threats
to materials or facilities (ee information page on [Security of Nuclear
Facilities and
Material](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/security/security-of-nuclear-facilities-and-material)).
Safeguarding focuses on restraining activities by states that could lead
to acquisition or development of nuclear weapons. It concerns mainly
materials and equipment in relation to rogue governments (see
information page on [Safeguards to Prevent Nuclear
Proliferation](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/non-proliferation/safeguards-to-prevent-nuclear-proliferation)).
No industry is immune from accidents, but all industries learn from
them. In civil aviation, there are [accidents every year and each is
meticulously analysed]{.underline}. The lessons from nearly one hundred
years' experience mean that reputable airlines are extremely safe. In
the chemical industry and oil-gas [industry, **[major accidents also
lead to improved safety]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There is wide public
acceptance that the risks associated with these industries are an
acceptable trade-off for our dependence on their product s and services.
With nuclear power, the high energy density makes the [potential
hazard]{.underline} obvious, and this has [always been factored into the
design of nuclear power plants. [The few accidents]{.mark}]{.underline}
[have]{.mark} been spectacular and newsworthy, but of [[little
consequence]{.mark} in terms of human fatalities.]{.underline} The
novelty value and hence newsworthiness of nuclear power accidents
remains high in contrast with other industrial accidents, which receive
comparatively little news coverage. Harnessing the world\'s most
concentrated energy source In the 1950s attention turned to harnessing
the power of the atom in a controlled way, as demonstrated at Chicago in
1942 and subsequently for military research, and applying the steady
heat yield to generate electricity. This naturally gave rise to concerns
about accidents and their possible effects. However, with nuclear power,
safety depends on much the same factors as in any comparable industry:
intelligent planning, proper design with conservative margins and
back-up systems, high-quality components and a well-developed safety
culture in operations. The operating lives of reactors depend on
maintaining their safety margin. A particular nuclear scenario was loss
of cooling which resulted in melting of the nuclear reactor core, and
this [motivated studies on both the physical and chemical possibilities
as well as the biological effects of any dispersed
radioactivity]{.underline}. Those responsible for nuclear power
technology in the West devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring that a
meltdown of the reactor core would not take place, since it was assumed
that a meltdown of the core would create a major public hazard, and if
uncontained, a tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities. In
avoiding such accidents the industry has been very successful. In the
60-year history of civil nuclear power generation, with over 18,500
cumulative reactor-years across 36 countries, there have been only three
significant accidents at nuclear power plants: [Three Mile
Island](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/three-mile-island-accident)
(USA 1979) where the reactor was severely damaged but radiation was
contained and there were no adverse health or environmental
consequences.
[Chernobyl](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident)
(Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of the reactor by steam explosion
and fire killed two people initially plus a further 28 from radiation
poisoning within three months, and had significant health and
environmental consequences. [Fukushima
Daiichi](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-daiichi-accident)
(Japan 2011) where three old reactors (together with a fourth) were
written off after the effects of loss of cooling due to a huge tsunami
were inadequately contained. There were [[no deaths or serious injuries
due to radioactivity]{.underline}]{.mark}, though about 19,500 people
were killed by the tsunami. Of all the accidents and incidents, only the
Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents resulted in radiation doses to the
public greater than those resulting from the exposure to natural
sources. The Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation exposure of
workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their health, unlike
Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one \'accident\') have been completely
confined to the plant. Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or
members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to
radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident. Most of the
serious radiological injuries and deaths that occur each year (2-4
deaths and many more exposures above regulatory limits) are the result
of large uncontrolled radiation sources, such as abandoned medical or
industrial equipment. (There have also been a number of accidents in
experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing pile -- at
Windscale, UK, in 1957 -- but [none of these resulted in loss of life
outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental
contamination.]{.underline}) See also Table in [Appendix 2: Serious

A reactor at UT\'s Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory on the J.J.
Pickle Research Campus in north Austin Fifty years ago, nuclear energy
was part of any futurist's vision of civilization. Then came the Three
Mile Island meltdown in 1979, when a Pennsylvania reactor failed,
terrifying the American public. Construction of 52 nuclear reactors was
canceled between 1980 and 1984. It did not help when in 1986 the
Chernobyl disaster sent a cloud of radioactive smoke over eastern
Europe. Most recently, in 2011, a tsunami hit Japan disabling the
cooling system at the Fukushima plant. Public enthusiasm for nuclear
power seemed to be in permanent decline. Now[, there is a looming energy
shortfall caused by population growth]{.underline}, our
ultra-technologized lifestyles, and ravenous data centers increasingly
using artificial intelligence that can't be built fast enough. (An
AI-enabled Google search uses 10 times as much electricity as a normal
Google search.) [This projected shortage has many leaders endorsing an
"all-of-the-above" approach to energy. And there, "above," sits
once-promising nuclear power.]{.underline} It gets so little mention ---
the energy conversation being dominated by fossil fuels and renewables
--- that many Americans would be surprised to learn that 20% of electric
power nationwide comes from nuclear plants. In Texas, due to the higher
rates of coal and wind usage, the fraction is 10%. (That power comes
from two plants: the South Texas Project outside Bay City and the
Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant at Glen Rose.) But that percentage
could go way up if new research by a consortium relying on UT expertise
is successful. The [goal is to build reactors that would be very
safe]{.underline}, small and therefore much more affordable to build,
and modular, so individual users such as data centers or refineries
might have their very own nuclear power plants yielding plentiful,
steady electricity. What's more, [these new reactors could desalinate
seawater or groundwater and help treat cancer by generating the isotopes
necessary for treatment. But first things first. And that's research.
"What's the potential for nuclear energy---" "It could change the
world,"]{.underline} says Derek Haas before the question is even
completed. At UT, Haas, an associate professor of mechanical
engineering, is leading the push to develop molten salt reactors. He
believes these refrigerator-sized reactors would address the two things
holding nuclear power back: public perception of nuclear safety, and
cost. \*\*\* **Safety, first.** Haas rejects the question of whether
molten salt reactors would make nuclear power safe, because he says it
always has been safe. "It's always been statistically safer than any
other form of energy, including renewables, when you factor in work
accidents and transportation accidents." Moreover, he says, ["When
people think of Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima, most of what
they are thinking is **wrong**." At Three Mile Island, **[no one
died]{.mark}** [or had]{.mark} adverse [health]{.mark} [impacts]{.mark}
[from the release of radioactive material,]{.mark} he says. "[People
were]{.mark} justifiably [scared]{.mark} because of the way it was
handled, [but **the release of radioactive material did not harm
anyone**]{.mark}," says Haas. Chernobyl on the other hand, [was "**as
bad** as nuclear can get]{.mark} because it was a really poor design
operated with bad controls. People died, and that is absolutely
something that we never want to happen again. Reactors today are
designed, and in the United States they've *always* been designed, to
avoid those kinds of impacts."]{.underline} In Fukushima, the Japanese
government paid out claims to one of the [workers who was
exposed]{.underline} to elevated levels of radiation voluntarily by
trying to help alleviate the accident and [died of cancer years later.
"He is the only person who could have had adverse health effects from
it."]{.underline} Haas says the only other people who died in the
reactor event were patients on ventilators and other life preserving
equipment who died in the evacuation of the area. "If you try to
evacuate vulnerable people when the power's out, it's a risk that can
lead to folks not surviving the evacuation. . . . But [there are people
who will get on the news and say that thousands or hundreds of thousands
of people died, and it's just wrong]{.underline}." Even incorporating
all three of those accidents, [[nuclear is]{.mark} still [one of the
**safest forms** of energy]{.mark}\-- per kilowatt hour,]{.underline}
says Haas. He calls it "[about as safe as wind and solar]{.underline}."
With those, because so many apparatuses have to be built to get the same
amount of energy, the accidents or deaths per watt is going to be higher
statistically merely from the installation of windmills and solar panels
and from simply driving equipment down the highway. And [nuclear power
is "dramatically safer"]{.underline} than burning coal, he says, because
of the health impacts of coal plant emissions. He calls even the
[current fleet of nuclear reactors, known as light-water reactors,
"amazingly safe."]{.underline} Haas has personal experience with nuclear
safety because, after earning three degrees at UT, the Corpus Christi
native knowingly moved to the most contaminated site in North America,
Hanford, W ash., where plutonium for nuclear weapons was made and
processed. There he worked at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. "I could see the site from my
backyard. I knew all the risks and chose to live there[. I looked at the
risks, and I said, yeah this is **absolutely safe**."]{.underline}
*Associate Professor Derek Haas* While working there, he visited more
than 20 countries doing international security work, but he discovered
his favorite part of the job was when he got to train new summer
interns. He fed off their excitement about learning new things. When he
heard there was a faculty job opening up at his alma mater, he thought,
"You know, I could make that my whole job." He joined the Walker
Mechanical Engineering Department in 2016 and teaches undergraduate and
graduate courses in nuclear engineering. With all that said about
safety, nuclear energy could be made even safer, and here is how: The
fuel in a molten salt reactor starts by taking salt, not too different
from table salt, and melting it. At a very high temperature, it flows
like water. At this point, uranium is added to the brew and melts with
it. When the fuel is put into the reactor, the uranium is bombarded with
neutrons kicking off the chain reaction of atomic fission, "going
critical," which generates even more heat. Whatever heat is generated is
siphoned away and converted to electricity. The reason these will be
safer than current light-water reactors is they will operate basically
at atmospheric pressure instead of within high-pressure systems that can
build up steam and explode, as at Fukushima. So [even if there were a
failure of some kind, there is nothing propelling radioactive material
out of the plant and into the environment.]{.underline} Additionally,
the salt wants to be a solid, so if it gets out of its furnace, it
simply drops it into a container that's not being heated and cools into
a solid, retaining most of the radioactive material. "It's not going to
be fun to clean that up, but there's no energy behind it to launch it
into the environment." This is [known as "walk-away safe."]{.underline}
Equally vital to the project's success is driving the cost down. This
issue fits hand-in-glove with the safety issue. Because light-water
reactors have had to be overbuilt because of safety concerns, they have
been incredibly expensive to construct. The South Texas Project took 14
years and about \$17 billion (adjusted) to build. "If we can change what
the reactor looks like, [we can incorporate more inherent safety and
bring the cost down so it's competitive with other sources of
energy.]{.underline} If you can make the reactor inherently safe, you
make it less expensive.

is Unlikely to Happen\" 2-11-2024

lily

First, let's look at the reasons why a nuclear war is unlikely to
happen. [One of the main deterrents against a nuclear war is the concept
of mutually assured destruction (MAD)]{.underline}. This means that if
one country launches a nuclear attack on another, the other country will
retaliate with equal or greater force, resulting in the destruction of
both sides. [This creates a situation where no one wins and everyone
loses, which makes it irrational for any country to start a nuclear
war.]{.underline}

[Another reason why a nuclear war is unlikely to happen is the existence
of international treaties and organizations that aim to prevent the
proliferation and use of nuclear weapons. For example, the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is a global agreement that
limits the number of countries that can possess nuclear weapons and
promotes peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) is an organization that monitors and inspects
nuclear facilities and activities around the world to ensure compliance
with the NPT and other agreements. The United Nations Security Council
(UNSC) is a body that can impose sanctions and resolutions on countries
that violate international norms and threaten peace and
security.]{.underline}

[These treaties and organizations have been effective in reducing the
number of nuclear weapons in the world and preventing their use in
conflicts.]{.underline} For example, since the end of the Cold War, the
United States and Russia have reduced their nuclear arsenals by more
than 80%. [The only time nuclear weapons were used in war was in 1945,
when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
Japan. Since then, no country has used or tested nuclear weapons in
combat, despite several crises and wars involving nuclear-armed
states]{.underline}

#### Arctic military presence isn't feasible -- that means an Arctic war is unlikely to happen

Arctic Operations, 'Let Alone Dominate,' Experts Say\" 1-18-2024

lily

There are many reasons for the gulf that exists between platitudes in
policy and priorities in practice, but a primary one is just the sheer
complexity of operating in the Arctic. [Maintaining equipment and
conducting operations in such an extremely cold environment require
unique standards and approaches.]{.underline}

"[Everything breaks in the Arctic]{.underline}," Savitz says. "[Fuels
gel, lubricants don't. The batteries fail, the materials shatter and
snap, everything is iced over. And it's extremely hard on
humans]{.underline}."

For instance, in the Pentagon's announcement of its Arctic strategy
office, Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for
Arctic and global resilience, pointed out that much of the military's
infrastructure in the far north is built on permafrost, which is melting
as the planet warms.

"We're working to mitigate that," Ferguson said at the time.

[The harsh environment makes continued maintenance paramount---a
challenge in budget cycles that tend to favor shiny new toys. And the
region's exceptional parameters mean equipment designed for the Arctic
might not be particularly useful elsewhere---another tough fiscal
sell.]{.underline}

Take the Navy's surface fleet, for example. U.S. naval submarines have,
for decades, operated in the Arctic---but primarily out of sight,
intentionally. The Navy's Arctic strategy promises an "enhanced
presence" in the Arctic, pledging to "provide our Sailors, Marines, and
Civilians with the education, training, and equipment necessary to
preserve peace and respond to crises in the region."

That's a complicated promise.

"[If you create a surface fleet that is specific to that region ... that
will become a heavier ship]{.underline}," Carlson says. "[And heavier
ships don't move as fast. They're not as agile. They're not as fuel
efficient]{.underline}."

So instead, the Navy's strategy points to partnerships with the Coast
Guard, which has more institutional knowledge about Arctic operations as
well as the military's only icebreakers.

"The Coast Guard has been the most active of any of the services in
trying to maintain Arctic capabilities and build capacity," Savitz says.

In part, that's because of the nature of Arctic security: It's more
about competition than it is about conflict. The Coast Guard is used to
a mission set that focuses on enforcing laws and regulations, and
responding when things go wrong.

For the other military branches, being told to wait around "in a place
that is remote, and where it's really hard to operate, and where you're
likely going to have various systems fail, when there's intense
attention on other parts of the world, or flare-ups, or crises" isn't
popular, Savitz says. "[Part of the problem is that there is such a
strong nondefense component of security up there.]{.underline}"

But the Coast Guard, as the only military branch housed in the
Department of Homeland Security, is always strapped for cash, and the
need for U.S. presence and response in the Arctic is only growing,
analysts argue. [A shrinking ice cap and increasing ship traffic raise
questions about regulating things like fisheries and access to other
resources, or enforcing international standards. And then there's the
issue of what happens if things go wrong---like an environmental
catastrophe or a search-and-rescue disaster.]{.underline}

"The intersection of climate change and, say, [economic factors, or the
intersection of changing demographics---all of those combinations also
then create these situations where I think these black swan-type events
may become a little bit more frequent,]{.underline}" Tingstad says. "The
U.S. as a whole has such global priorities---something has to get racked
and stacked, and that's certainly understandable. [But from an Arctic
perspective, of course, the concern is that it's low probability. It
feels low probability until it actually happens."]{.underline}

## Authoritarianism

Competition"

akshaj

Just as some autocracies successfully adapted to the challenges of the
First and Second Industrial Revolutions, some also did so in response to
the challenges of the third. During and since the twentieth century,
smart [authoritarians have recognized that traditional
methods]{.underline} of control [made]{.underline} their [economies less
competitive]{.underline}. Thus, some leaders adapted, changing both
their methods of control as well as their economic policies.\[80\]

Smart authoritarians cultivated the high levels of human capital
necessary for economic competitiveness.

Smart authoritarians cultivated the high levels of human capital
necessary for economic competitiveness. For example, [investments in
education and other public goods underpinned]{.underline} the rapid
[economic rises of the Four Asian Tigers]{.underline} (Hong Kong,
Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan).\[81\] Clever dictators provided
public goods while withholding what are termed coordination goods, which
empower people to move against the regime.\[82\] Furthermore, [dictators
figured out how to provide the private goods that kept their domestic
supporters happy, while minimizing the economically enervating effects
of rent-seeking: they did so by engaging in less economically damaging
kinds of corruption]{.underline} and by confining corruption to certain
inward-facing ministries while creating professionalism in key economic
offices.\[83\]

Smart [authoritarians also accepted greater institutional
constraints]{.underline}. In contrast to personalist dictatorships,
single- or multi-party regimes created political parties and
legislatures, and many even held elections.\[84\] With an eye toward
attracting global capital, many regimes upheld property rights,
maintained macroeconomic stability, and repaid loans.\[85\] Scholars
have noted that autocracies also vary in the efficiency and fairness of
their judicial systems.\[86\] In Singapore, for example, the dominant
People's Action Party uses the courts to weaken its political opponents,
yet the judiciary is formally independent, an arrangement designed to
convince inventors and foreign investors that their property rights will
be upheld. As scholar Gordon Silverstein has argued, "Singapore forces
us to recognize the error so many Western politicians, pundits, and
academics make in conflating liberal democracy---and its maximization of
individual liberty---with the rule of law."\[87\]

Furthermore, smart [authoritarians]{.underline}, having [recognized the
many benefits of civil society]{.underline}, created a version of it
compatible with their interests. Civil society helps negotiate reforms
between governments and their citizens, communicates people's concerns,
provides some public services, and encourages the flow of ideas.\[88\]
Autocrats also created government-operated quasi-nongovernmental
organizations.\[89\] Some authoritarian leaders allowed the rise of
nominally private media (albeit outlets still controlled by the
government). In response to the rise of digital media, [dictators moved
beyond censorship to adopt innovative tools]{.underline} of information
control.\[90\] In these ways, authoritarians enjoyed the benefits of
private media (such as increased information flows and monitoring of
government performance and public opinion) without suffering the costs
of political instability.\[91\]

Smart authoritarians, wary of an increasingly bright global spotlight,
shifted from "high" to "low"-intensity repression.\[92\] Sergei Guriev
and Daniel Treisman have argued that autocrats are changing their
strategies of repression; they "use violence sparingly. They prefer the
ankle bracelet to the Gulag."\[93\] Instead of violently suppressing
opposition, as scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan A. Way have written,
modern autocracies rely more on carrots and on less obvious methods of
repression.\[94\] [Dictators today are more likely to undermine
opponents using character assassination and lawsuits for nonpolitical
crimes]{.underline}. "Informational authoritarianism," as Guriev and
Treisman have called it, is "better adapted to a world of open borders,
international media, and knowledge-based economies."\[95\] In making
this point, they have noted examples such as Singapore's former leader
Lee Kuan Yew, former president Alberto Fujimori of Peru, Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán of Hungary, and others. Through such adaptations,
authoritarian regimes have grown more resilient, have presided over more
economic growth, and have reversed the trend of democratization that
characterized the late twentieth century.\[96\]

#### Authoritarianism doesn't scale up, Russia and China aren't revisionist

**Wilson 19** (Jeanne L. Wilson is a Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of
Russian Studies and Professor of Political Science at Wheaton
College Norton.  She is also a Research Associate at the Davis Center of
Russian and Eurasian Studies, Harvard University. *Are Russia and China
revisionist states?* Asia Dialogue, June 11^th^, 2019)
\[https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states/\]//rich

In the past few years, Russia and China have increasingly been referred
to as revisionist powers. For example, both the [United States' 2017
National Security
Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf) and
the [United States' 2018 National Defence
Strategy](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf) identify
Russia and China as revisionist states. The concept of revisionism
encompasses various meanings that typically distinguish between states
that accept the status quo distribution of power in the international
system and those which seek to alter it to their advantage. Here, I am
primarily concerned with the extent to which Russia and China challenge
the implicit assumptions that underpin the norms and values of what
might be referred to as the international community in the English
School sense of the term[. I argue that **[Russia and China are not
revisionist]{.mark}** but rather neo-revisionist states.]{.underline}
However, it is China rather than Russia that is more likely
substantively to challenge the status quo and assume the position of a
full-blown revisionist power in the future.

Both Western analysts and policymakers have identified a litany of
Russian and Chinese behaviour that indicates nonconformance to what is
portrayed as universal norms and values. In fact, Russia and China
contest a set of neoliberal practices that have evolved in the
post-World War Two international order.  Foremost amongst these is the
evolution of human rights as a universal value that legitimizes
intervention in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state (although
Russia has made use of the rhetoric of the "responsibility to protect"
to justify its activities in the post-Soviet space). Russia and China
similarly view the West's elevation of liberal democracy as a universal
ideal as a subterfuge for the fomenting of Colour Revolutions that seek
regime change in noncompliant targeted states.

At the same time, [[Russia and China]{.mark} **accept** and in fact
[continuously **reaffirm their commitment** to]{.mark} a number of
[fundamental precepts of]{.mark} the [international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include the [[primacy of state
sovereignty]{.mark} and [territorial integrity]{.mark}, the [importance
of international law]{.mark}, and the [centrality of]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations,]{.underline} particularly with
[**respect** [to the]{.mark} key [role of]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited
[N]{.mark}ations** [Security Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. It must be
acknowledged that Russian and Chinese promotion of these concepts does
not necessarily provide a reliable guide to their foreign policy
behaviour (although the same criticism can be lodged against countless
other states). [Russia and China [also **actively participate**
in]{.mark} aspects of **[global governance]{.mark}**, [placing]{.mark}
an **[emphasis]{.mark}** on the [United Nations]{.mark} as the [ultimate
source of international authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Both [states
have signed]{.mark} a number of [United Nations Conventions and
Covenants]{.mark} including the [International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are [[members]{.mark} of a
number [of multilateral and regional structures]{.mark}
(]{.underline}although Russia has been suspended from participation in
the G-7). [The [two states **stress their commitment**]{.mark} to the
[maintenance of global]{.mark} and regional [security supporting the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons]{.mark}, the [non-militarization of
space]{.mark}, and the [need to fight terrorism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Critically, Russia and China act as rule takers rather than challengers
in their participation in the global financial institutions.
[[China]{.mark}, in particular, has [emerged as a **vocal
supporter**]{.mark} of [globalization and free trade]{.mark} in
conspicuous contrast to the United States in the Trump
administration.]{.underline} Russia and China's view of the operation of
the international system conforms in a large part to Westphalian
precepts, while rejecting the West's more recent adoption of
humanitarian and individualistic norms and values (which in fact exist
in a state of uneasy tension with the traditional assumptions of the
Westphalian order). In this sense, Russia and China are neo-revisionist
rather than revisionist states.

Under the Xi Jinping leadership, China has adopted a more assertive
foreign policy that, in contrast to the behaviour of past leadership,
confidently asserts China's status as a great power.  On the one hand,
this is reflected in the State's efforts to readjust China's role in
international structures, as seen in the attempt to expand its
decision-making power within the International Monetary Fund. This sort
of behaviour, however, takes place within the boundaries of the
contemporary international community. On the other hand, China's
launching of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 can be viewed as
offering an alternative vision of global governance that challenges the
approach promoted by the hegemonic Western powers. Beijing has offered a
number of rationales for BRI which are in themselves at least in part
persuasive. This massive infrastructure project can be seen as a means
of developing China's Western regions, utilizing surplus capital and
providing employment, extending Chinese export markets, and securing
domestic energy supplies. Generally speaking, the Chinese leadership has
sought to downplay the strategic and geopolitical implications of BRI.

https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/new-authoritarianism) akshaj

[Dictatorships are not what they used to be]{.underline}. The
totalitarian tyrants of the past -- such as Hitler, Stalin, Mao, or Pol
Pot -- employed terror, indoctrination, and isolation to monopolise
power. Although less ideological, many 20th-century military regimes
also relied on mass violence to intimidate dissidents. Pinochet's
agents, for instance, are thought to have tortured and killed tens of
thousands of Chileans (Roht-Arriaza 2005).

However, in recent decades [new types of authoritarianism]{.underline}
have emerged that seem better adapted to a world of open borders, global
media, and knowledge-based economies. From the Peru of Alberto Fujimori
to the Hungary of Viktor Orban, illiberal regimes [have managed to
consolidate power without fencing off their countries or resorting to
mass murder]{.underline}. Some bloody military regimes and totalitarian
states remain -- such as Syria and North Korea -- but [the balance has
shifted]{.underline}.

The [new autocracies often simulate democracy]{.underline}, holding
elections that the incumbents almost always win, bribing and censoring
the private press rather than abolishing it, and replacing comprehensive
political ideologies with an amorphous resentment of the West (Gandhi
2008, Levitsky and Way 2010). Their leaders often enjoy genuine
popularity -- at least after eliminating any plausible rivals. State
propaganda aims not to 'engineer human souls' but to boost the
dictator's ratings. [Political opponents are harassed and defamed,
charged with fabricated crimes, and encouraged to emigrate, rather than
being murdered en masse.]{.underline}

Dictatorships and information

In a recent paper, we argue that the distinctive feature of such new
dictatorships is a preoccupation with information (Guriev and Treisman
2015). Although they do use violence at times, they maintain power less
by terrorising victims than by manipulating beliefs. Of course,
surveillance and propaganda were important to the old-style
dictatorships, too. But violence came first. "Words are fine things, but
muskets are even better," Mussolini quipped. Compare that to the
confession of Fujimori's security chief, Vladimir Montesinos: "The
addiction to information is like an addiction to drugs". Killing members
of the elite struck Montesinos as foolish: "Remember why Pinochet had
his problems. We will not be so clumsy" (McMillan and Zoido 2004).

We study the logic of a dictatorship in which the leader survives by
manipulating information. Our key assumption is that citizens care about
effective government and economic prosperity; first and foremost, they
want to select a competent rather than incompetent ruler. However, the
general public does not know the competence of the ruler; only the
dictator himself and members of an 'informed elite' observe this
directly. Ordinary citizens make what inferences they can, based on
their living standards -- which depend in part on the leader's
competence -- and on messages sent by the state and independent media.
The latter carry reports on the leader's quality sent by the informed
elite. If a sufficient number of citizens come to believe their ruler is
incompetent, they revolt and overthrow him.

[The challenge for]{.underline} an incompetent [dictator
is]{.underline}, then, [to fool the public]{.underline} into thinking he
is competent. He chooses from among a repertoire of tools -- propaganda,
repression of protests, co-optation of the elite, and censorship of
their messages. [All such tools cost money]{.underline}, which must come
from taxing the citizens, depressing their living standards, and
indirectly lowering their estimate of the dictator's competence. Hence
the trade-off.

Certain findings emerge from the logic of this game.

First, we show how modern autocracies can survive while employing
relatively little violence against the public.

[Repression is not necessary if mass beliefs can be manipulated
sufficiently. Dictators win a confidence game rather than an armed
combat]{.underline}. Indeed, since in our model repression is only used
if equilibria based on non-violent methods no longer exist, violence can
signal to opposition forces that the regime is vulnerable.

BERLIN --- Donald [[Trump makes light of **trade
wars**]{.underline}]{.mark}, claiming they are easy to win. We're about
to find out if he's right.

The U.S. president has imposed tariffs of 10 percent on China from
Tuesday, while Mexico and Canada won last-minute stays of execution on
25 percent tariffs. He's also threatening to hit the European Union ---
a major exporter of cars, medicines and food to the United States.

Trump says he wants to use the tariff weapon to halt the flow of
fentanyl and illegal migrants across the northern and southern borders
of the United States. To do so he has invoked emergency powers --- even
though the U.S. economy is growing strongly and is at full employment.

He also wants to close the \$1 trillion U.S. trade deficit with the rest
of the world. Team Trump argues that throwing up a tariff wall will
force companies to move investment and jobs back to the U.S. --- think
of all those silicon chips now made in Taiwan or iPhones made in China.

But critics warn that Trump's trade war will result in higher prices,
lower growth, lost jobs and disrupted supply chains --- both at home and
abroad. They also argue that tariffs are the wrong tool to fix a trade
deficit caused by America's borrowing and consumption habits.

Here's what Trump's trade war is all about:

What's a trade war?

First up, a [[trade war **isn't** an actual war]{.underline}]{.mark}:
It's a [[conflict]{.mark} that [results when one side feels]{.mark} that
a trading [relationship]{.mark} is **[unfair]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Let's say you flood my market with cheap steel, at prices below the cost
of production. Companies in my country are going to the wall. They are
laying off workers. My voters. That's dumping and, under the rules of
global trade, I can retaliate by imposing tariffs on your steel.

For a [trade [conflict]{.mark} like this to [turn into a trade
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [things need to
**escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. And that's what is happening here:
Trump is still threatening to hit America's closest trading partners
with tariffs on pretty much everything. That means we [could be about to
embark on the biggest trade war since the 1930s]{.underline}.

How do tariffs work?

Trump claims that his new tariffs will make Americans rich --- he's even
promised to set up a new External Revenue Service to collect all the
revenues that they throw off. He also says foreign companies will pay
them and that they won't hurt U.S. consumers.

That's not how they work, however. [[Tariffs]{.mark} are a tax that is
[paid by the **importer** at the border]{.mark}]{.underline}. If they go
up, the importer faces a choice --- to pass on the price increase to the
consumer, or to accept a squeeze on their profit margins.

Price increases from Trump's across-the-board tariffs would show up
immediately in consumer inflation, economists say. And although he has
promised to offset their impact with tax cuts elsewhere, there is no
sign of that happening yet.

As for the potential revenue from tariffs, Trump likes to hark back to
the late 19th century, when tariffs accounted for over half of U.S.
federal revenues. But that was before income tax --- which today
supports a government much larger in relation to the overall economy.
There is just no way that tariff revenues can pay for a modern state.

When was the [[last trade war]{.underline}]{.mark}?

In [[Trump's first term]{.underline}]{.mark}. He imposed 25 percent
duties on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in 2018 --- while the
European Union responded by slapping \$6 billion in tariffs on Harley
Davidson motorbikes, Levi's jeans and bourbon.

Trump threatened to escalate by hitting imports of European cars --- but
it never came to that. Eventually, the tariffs were suspended by both
sides. The EU truce expires at the end of March, meaning that even if
Trump doesn't hit Europe with tariffs now, their trade dispute could
still get out of hand.

The clearest precedent is likely the so-called Nixon shock of 1971. The
starting point was comparable to today: The costs of the Vietnam War and
of the Great Society policies of the 1960s had tipped the United States
from surplus into deficit.

In an attempt to restore the balance, President Richard Nixon abolished
the gold standard --- forcing the trading partners of the U.S. to
revalue their currencies. He ordered a 90-day freeze on wages and
prices. And he imposed a 10 percent import tax.

Nixon's actions are considered to have been a political success but an
economic failure. The import tax was scrapped within months. And the
U.S. economy struggled for years with stagflation --- a combination of
low growth and high inflation --- that was only squeezed out of the
system in the 1980s by Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's tough
monetary policies.

Who is the **[[real enemy]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although Trump has only threatened to hit
China with tariffs of 10 percent, the tariffs still hanging over Canada
and Mexico are indirectly aimed at Beijing.

That's because, under the USMCA trade accord (the successor to NAFTA),
Chinese companies --- e.g. makers of electric vehicles --- would
normally enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market if they locate
production in North America.

In recent years there has been bipartisan consensus in Washington on the
need to fight back against China and its economic model, which has
created vast industrial overcapacity and has flooded world markets with
surplus production. Since taking office, however, Trump has dialed back
the rhetoric, saying he just wants a "fair" trading relationship with
China.

One thing to watch: Will Trump drop the tariffs against America's allies
if they agree to align with the United States in shutting out China?
That's one straw the European Union is clutching at in the hope of
keeping the transatlantic peace.

How far **[[can this escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

Trump, in his second incarnation as U.S. president, has shown no
inhibitions in questioning the territorial integrity of other nations
--- jibing that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state or staking a
claim to Greenland, a protectorate of EU member Denmark.

A greater concern is that, in playing fast and loose with international
law, Trump is playing into the hands of leaders --- like Russia's
Vladimir Putin --- who want to overturn the status quo. In a world where
multiple fires are burning, [[Trump is liberally **splashing** gasoline
and **tossing** matches to **start new ones**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Trade Wars\-\--Economy Resillient\-\--1NC

#### The economy is durable enough to avoid escalation via trade wars

James **Pethokoukis 25**, James Pethokoukis is a senior fellow and the
DeWitt Wallace Chair at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), where
he analyzes US economic policy, 6/23/25, "Why Trade Wars Have Yet to
Sink Global Growth,"
https://www.aei.org/economics/why-trade-wars-have-yet-to-sink-global-growth/,
Troh

The world economy has surprised pessimists. [[Despite America's Trumpian
tariff tantrum and the Middle East again teetering on the brink,
**growth has proven unexpectedly durable.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Fresh
surveys cited by the Wall Street Journal show activity expanding across
the eurozone and big Asian economies, from Japan to India. Even Germany
and Britain---both threatened by American trade sanctions---are seeing
order books recover from their spring doldrums. One major bank has just
lifted its American growth forecast. Yet this resilience, while real,
looks far from robust.

What explains this stubborn vitality? Much of the answer lies in the
necessity-driven ingenuity of global supply chains. Chinese exporters
have become masters of creative geography, rerouting goods through
Southeast Asia to sidestep American tariffs, according to JPMorgan. As
direct shipments from China to America have plunged by nearly 40 percent
since March, exports from Chinese factories to Vietnam and Thailand have
soared. These countries are, in turn, sending far more to American
ports, a predictable game of transshipment that is blunting the
protectionist edge. JPMorgan figures this shuffle is shaving a full
percentage point off America's effective tariff rate, just enough to
help ease inflation and keep goods flowing.

JPM:

This may seem like a small change, but represents almost 10% of the
increase in tariffs in 2025 and so is not macroeconomically trivial.
Furthermore, because rerouting takes time to establish, transshipment
could only be expected to increase in the coming months.

[[The tariff outlook]{.mark} itself [has]{.mark} also
[stabilized]{.mark}.]{.underline} After April's "Liberation Day" panic,
when markets braced for a 20-percentage-point spike in effective duties,
Goldman Sachs now expects a smaller---though still hefty---14-point rise
for 2025. That reduction in tariff expectations, the bank argues, has
"helped financial conditions ease and pushed statistical measures of
policy uncertainty down from the highs." As a result, Goldman has
upgraded its 2025 US GDP growth forecast to 1.25 percent---still below
trend, by the way---and trimmed its recession probability to 30 percent.

This cautious optimism shows up in corporate behavior too. American
firms with heavy exposure to Europe and China are quietly freezing
hiring and paring back capital-spending plans. Yet the overall
deceleration remains measured, Goldman concludes. [[Supply-chain
disruptions are]{.underline}]{.mark} still [[rare]{.underline}]{.mark}.
While the most tariff-exposed companies are starting to pass costs to
customers, the typical firm expects consumers to absorb only about half
the tariff burden---limiting, for now, the inflationary pass-through.

Such soft data have misled before, however. Some of today's buoyancy may
simply reflect "frontloading"---a temporary lift as firms and consumers
rush to beat tariff hikes. More ominously, as Goldman warned just hours
before America's military strike on three Iranian nuclear sites, the
threat of escalation in Iran still looms. Oil prices had risen \$10 per
barrel since early June even before the bombing, and while that has yet
to dent inflation or output, the risk of deeper conflict---particularly
one that chokes the Strait of Hormuz---could dramatically alter the
calculus. Shipping groups are already avoiding that vital waterway.

The bottom line is that [[economic actors have been betting that
**President Trump's bark exceeds his bite** and that neither tariff
spikes nor Middle Eastern conflagration will spiral beyond
control.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### AT: Miscalc\-\--Myth\-\--1NC

#### Miscalc is a myth.

**Schake '23** \[Kori; July 2023; Senior Fellow and Director, Foreign
and Defense Policy Studies, American Enterprise Institute; The
Exculpating Myth of Accidental War,
https://sais.jhu.edu/kissinger/programs-and-projects/kissinger-center-papers/exculpating-myth-accidental-war;
akshaj\]

The [risk of war by **[miscalculation]{.mark}**]{.underline} is a
[popular]{.underline} scholarly [subject]{.underline} and a [frequent
[concern of policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Theories]{.underline} of
war by miscalculation [[assume]{.mark} either **[ignorance]{.mark}** by
decisionmakers]{.underline}, [[bad **faith**]{.mark} by policy
participants]{.underline} (usually the military), [or a mechanistic
series of exchanges]{.underline} that obviate the need for policymakers
to display judgment and responsibility. Yet historians struggle to
produce evidence that political leaders were either ignorant of the
risks they were choosing or emasculated from any ability to affect the
course of events. [[Theories of accidental war]{.underline}]{.mark} are,
as Geoffrey Blainey has said, "a [description [masquerading]{.mark} as
an explanation]{.underline}."\[1\] Instead of explaining historical
events, the [[**myth** of accidental war]{.underline}]{.mark} provides
an intricate puzzle for intellectuals, a justification for moralists to
fear military subversion of political decisionmakers, and an [[evasion
of culpability]{.mark} for those decisionmakers]{.underline}.

The debate is not esoteric---it has urgent policy applications. U.S.
policy regarding Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine
has been heavily influenced by U.S. President Joe Biden and his
administration's concerns about "a third world war."\[2\] Russia
violated the sovereignty and the internationally recognized territory of
Ukraine, despite its commitment to respect Ukraine's security in the
1995 Budapest Memorandum. Failing to achieve its political objectives on
the battlefield, Russian strategy shifted to targeting civilian
dwellings, destroying infrastructure, and committing mass atrocities.
All of these actions violate Russia's international commitments and
overtly challenge the Biden administration's leadership of the
rules-based international order, as well as its pledge to "stand against
human rights abuses wherever they occur."\[3\]

Although [**[rational calculations]{.mark}** of power ought to [dictate
Russian aversion to expanding]{.mark} the war from a trajectory of
losing to Ukraine]{.underline} to one of more rapidly and decisively
losing should the United States become a direct combatant, the Biden
team's policy is predicated on concerns that uncontrollable escalation
could result from U.S. assistance to Ukraine. To avoid an accidental war
with Russia, the Biden administration has defended the [[international
order by timidly progressing from declining]{.underline}]{.mark} before
and in the early stages of the invasion to provide weapons to Ukraine
because they would quickly end up in Russian hands if Russia won as
expected, to refusing to provide "offensive weapons," to providing
"offensive weapons" but not those that could reach Russian territory, to
providing weapons that could reach Russian territory but making Ukraine
promise not to use them at those ranges, to allowing Ukraine to target
Russian forces in Crimea, to providing tanks and training in the United
States.\[4\] Out of concern the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates could
[unavoidably be drawn in]{.mark}to direct combat against
Russia]{.underline}, the strongest power in the international order is
conveying the limits of its interest to a violent transgressor losing a
war against a lesser power.

[The idea that [war]{.mark} happens by **[accident]{.mark}** is
[prejudicing U.S. policy toward
**self-deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The idea of accidental war also influences U.S. policy toward China, the
"pacing challenge" in its great power rivalry, according to the Biden
administration's October 2022 National Security Strategy.\[5\] The
United States publicizes Chinese infractions, like the construction of
island military bases in the South China Sea, but does not enforce
compliance. And China is playing that concern to its advantage,
undertaking demonstrations of its willingness to violate U.S.
sovereignty, initiating dangerous military incidents, explaining
provocations as its military acting without political knowledge, and
refusing to answer military hotline calls during crises. This shows that
the errant notion that war happens unaccountably, that [political
[leaders]{.mark} are [**powerless** to prevent
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}, that militaries will act independently
of political control and blunder states into conflict has immediate
policy relevance. The [idea that war happens by accident]{.underline} is
prejudicing [U.S. policy toward self-deterrence]{.underline}; national
security experts should [[instead]{.mark} be more [concerned about
**deliberate choices**]{.mark}]{.underline} for war as they think about
deterrence and escalation control.

What Is [Meant by Accidental War]{.underline}?

It is very [difficult to know with [precision the **combination** of
political commitment]{.mark}]{.underline} to objectives, military power,
the ability to marshal economic resources, and the social fortitude that
combatants possess until they fight. Blainey persuasively has argued
that war is how relative power is determined in the international
order.\[6\] As Carl von Clausewitz explained and Russia's invasion of
Ukraine demonstrates, war is a gambling game. If accidental war means
nothing more than leaders misjudging their relative power, then every
war is a mistake. This is because, as Blainey has concluded, "[[war is
usually the outcome of a **diplomatic crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark}
which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of
their bargaining power."\[7\]

Strikingly, across nearly eighty years of the nuclear age . . . there
have been few accidents, and none of them led to an automatic escalation
or failure by political and military leaders to make judgments dampening
the prospects of war.

To be intellectually useful, a [robust definition of accidental war
matters]{.underline}. At its most basic, accidental war could be
mischance---a confused signal, the technical failure of a weapon, or the
accidental launch of a missile. Alexander George has termed this kind of
scenario "inadvertent war."\[8\] It is striking that across nearly
eighty years of the nuclear age, incorporating U.S. and Soviet arsenals
in the tens of thousands and less developed countries designing
indigenous arsenals and delivery systems, there have been few accidents,
and none of them led to an automatic escalation or [[failure by
political and military leaders]{.mark} to make judgments dampening the
prospects of war]{.underline}.

But [although scholars engaging in the debate use the terms accidental
and inadvertent war]{.underline} interchangeably, genuine inadvertence
is mostly not what is meant in the debate about [[accidental
war]{.underline}]{.mark}; rather, mostly what is meant is [[**willful
subversion** of political inten]{.mark}t]{.underline}.\[9\] George
distinguished inadvertent from accidental war, defining the latter as
"one that starts because of unauthorized activities by individuals below
the leadership level in the chain of command."\[10\] Meanwhile, Marc
Trachtenberg has defined accidental war as "one in which the political
process--- a process that would [[normally lead to a peaceful settlement
of the dispute at hand]{.underline}]{.mark}---is overwhelmed by forces
welling up from within the military sphere . . . If the political
leaders thought the risks were relatively limited, but the military
structure in place [created a much grea[ter level of risk in time of
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, then one could conceivably have what, from
the point of view of the political leadership, would be an 'accidental
war.'"\[11\] Scott Sagan also has narrowed the aperture of unauthorized
activities to the [[military, defining wars as
accidental]{.underline}]{.mark} only when "there would have to be some
activity or incident inside the military machine, without which war
would not have occurred."\[12\]

The idea of accidental war has been of particular interest to political
scientists rather than historians, which seems a significant
detail---the experts on concepts are intrigued, the experts of the case
studies find no corroborating examples. No less a source than the
distinguished military historian Michael Howard has rejected the idea,
writing, "if history shows any record of 'accidental' wars, I have yet
to find them."\[13\]

An exhaustive study by Evan Luard of wars dating from 1400 CE to 1985
did not turn up a single case of [accidental
[inception]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[14\] Sagan, a political scientist and
proponent of the accidental war idea, has admitted as much,
acknowledging, "in the major works by historians on the causes of war,
however, the whole idea of [accidental [war]{.mark}]{.underline} is
either conspicuous by its absence or explicitly [[dismissed as]{.mark}
conceptually [**confused** and historically
**irrelevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[15\]

International Law at Purdue; Assessing the Risks of Unintentional
Nuclear War: An American Imperative,

akshaj\]

In an impressively-prepared television documentary, The Fog of War,
one-time US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara warns about the limits
of rationality in world politics. More precisely, according to McNamara,
even [perfectly-reasoning **[nuclear adversaries]{.mark}** could
suddenly or incrementally [find themselves in a war]{.mark} that
[neither]{.mark} party had ever [wanted]{.mark}]{.underline}. Secretary
McNamara, we should recall, served President John F Kennedy as his
principal military advisor during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

There is more. Concluding The Fog of War, McNamara warns openly and
unambiguously about America's diminishing prospects for nuclear war
avoidance. In the final analysis, we may learn from the film, it was
just "dumb luck" that prevented nuclear war with the Soviet Union back
in October 1962. As for the future,\[1\] the 1960s era "SecDef"
summarizes succinctly: "Rationality won't save us."\[2\]

The core problem for major states is still national survival in an
international "state of nature."\[3\] More than ever before, especially
during tangible crises, the United States is apt to rely on variously
complex dynamics of military threat. Among other things, this means
constantly changing calculations about alliance obligations,
retaliations and strategic deterrence. Significantly, because a nuclear
war has never been fought, gainful defense policies will need to be
based on abstract deductions rather than tangible historical
events.\[4\]

Dealing with Expectations of "**[[Escalation
Dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}**"

[International crises and confrontations are essentially
**[inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the only way for powerful
states like the United States to remain powerful is by demonstrating
capacity and willingness to dominate high-value escalations. To best
ensure such a perceived capacity, this country will need to take
exceptional risks, but -- simultaneously -- avoid nuclear warfare. Prima
facie, such existential problems should be managed intellectually before
they are displayed politically.

The [[odds of a nuclear war]{.mark} (deliberate and
**[unintentional]{.mark}**) are [not scientifically
calculable]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because [meaningful probability
judgments]{.underline} in science must always [be based on the
discernible frequency of relevant past events]{.underline}. Ironically,
though it is obviously good news that there has never been a nuclear
war, this fact also means that [science-based predictions of nuclear
conflict odds]{.underline} are logically impossible.

How should the incumbent American president proceed? In protecting the
United States from deliberate nuclear attack, American strategists will
need to [[accept core assumptions of **enemy
rationality**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[5\] By definition, without such
assumptions, there could be no coherent theory of nuclear strategy and
nuclear war.\[6\] Nonetheless, [these same assumptions have [no
**identifiable basis** in history]{.mark}]{.underline}, and would not
hold up in all potentially-impending cases,

There are further details. [**[Critical dangers]{.mark}** could be
created by enemy hacking operations, computer malfunctions ([accidental
nuclear war) or decision-making **miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(whether by the enemy, the United States\[7\] or both). In the plausibly
indecipherable third-case scenario, damaging synergies could arise that
would prove difficult or even impossible to reverse.

Historical Context and Present Threats

In these matters, history deserves some evident pride of place. Since
1945, [the [global balance of power]{.mark} has been
**[transformed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in considerable measure, to a
"balance of terror."\[8\] In crisis circumstances where at least one
adversarial state party to a conflict was already nuclear, a search for
"[escalation dominance]{.underline}" could [[enlarge]{.mark} the [risks
of **inadvertent** nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although widely
underestimated, such [risks would include nuclear war by accident or
decisional miscalculation]{.underline} and could be incurred in almost
any part of the world. Where only one state party was already nuclear,
these risks would reference an "**[[asymmetrical nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

The more-or-less transient "solution" to [**[proliferating
risks]{.mark}** is]{.underline} not to [wish-away the ubiquitous
search]{.underline} for "escalation dominance" (any such wish would be
contrary to the "logic" of anarchic world politics\[9\]), but to manage
all prospectively [nuclear crises at their lowest possible levels of
destructiveness]{.underline}. Wherever feasible, of course, it would be
best to avoid such crises altogether and maintain reliable "circuit
breakers" against strategic hacking and technical malfunction. At the
same time, especially in furtherance of [nuclear war avoidance, [hope
can never be a **correct strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Among other things, existential conflict risks to the United States will
be related to this country's changing alliance arrangements.
Accordingly, [US defense planners]{.underline} should [focus more
explicit policy attention]{.underline} on the expected consequences of
President Donald Trump's breach with NATO over Ukraine\[10\] and on
Israel's changing ties with certain Sunni Arab states. These
Israeli-Sunni Arab ties center on preventing a common enemy in Shiite
Iran from "going nuclear."

Israel's own nuclear security decisions will have serious implications
for the United States. Though Israel currently has no nuclear
adversaries, the rapidly accelerating approach of a nuclear Iran\[11\]
could encourage nuclearization by Saudi Arabia, Egypt and/or Turkey.
Moreover, non-Arab Pakistan\[12\] will likely become a more direct
adversary of the United States and Israel.\[13\] As a generally
overlooked early warning, Pakistani jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba
carried out the large-scale attack against India (Mumbai) back in 2008.

There is more. Pakistan is an already nuclear Islamic state with close
ties to China. Like Israel, Pakistan is not a party to the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Nuclear China has never renounced its
right or intention to "recover" Taiwan by military force.

Remembering Clausewitz

"Everything is very simple in war," says Carl von Clausewitz in On War,
"but the simplest thing is very difficult." With America "in the loop,"
Israel should consider those circumstances where issuing specifically
nuclear threats against its still pre-nuclear adversary in Tehran would
seem gainful. In part, at least, conclusions would depend on Jerusalem's
prior transformations of "deliberate nuclear ambiguity" (the "bomb in
the basement"\[14\]) into recognizable variants of "selective nuclear
disclosure." Though such considerations would necessarily concern
matters that are sui generis or without historical precedent, Israel has
no analytic alternative to launching deductive policy investigations.

What is the [[probabilistic difference]{.underline}]{.mark} between a
[[deliberate or intentional nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark} and one
that [would be unintentional or **[inadvertent]{.mark}**]{.underline}?
Without carefully considering this core distinction, little of
**[[pragmatic use]{.underline}]{.mark}** could be said about the
[[calculable likelihood of any nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Any such lack of consideration would be imprudent ipso facto. Because
there has never been an authentic nuclear war(Hiroshima and Nagasaki
don't "count"),\[15\] determining relevant probabilities must always
represent a sorely problematic task.

Though with greater "**[[informality]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [capable
analysts and decision-makers]{.underline} will still have to [[devise
optimal]{.mark} [strategies]{.mark} for [predicting and averting a
**nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Inter alia, this calculation will
vary according to (1) presumed enemy intention; (2) presumed
plausibility of accident or hacking intrusion; and/or (3) presumed
plausibility of decisional-miscalculation. When considered together as
cumulative categories of nuclear threat, these three component risks of
an unintentional nuclear war should be described as "high-urgency."

There will be assorted linguistic clarifications. Any particular
instance of an [accidental nuclear war]{.underline} would be
inadvertent. However, not every case of inadvertent nuclear war would be
the result of an accident. Most worrisome would be [preemptive
strikes]{.underline} that leave the victim state unsure about [follow-on
strikes]{.underline}.\[16\] Here, in order to protect itself against
such [more-or-less plausible strikes]{.underline}, the victim state
might launch a massive or all-out retaliation.\[17\]

[The notion that [Russia **exploits**]{.mark} a space between peace and
war called [the 'grey zone' to **wage war**]{.mark} using unconventional
means **[ignores]{.mark}** the [reality]{.mark} of [contemporary Russian
aggression]{.mark}, and [breeds **passivity** in Western
responses]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What is the myth?

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the idea of Russia
exploiting a '[grey]{.underline} zone' in
warfare [caught hold](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1303) among
policymakers and practitioners, swiftly followed by academics. A [RAND
Corporation study](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2539.html) claimed
Russia used 'disguised special operations units, disinformation tactics,
and local proxy forces' to seize the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. For
other analysts, deniability and ambiguity were
the [defining characteristics](https://warontherocks.com/2015/05/fighting-and-winning-in-the-gray-zone/) of
grey-zone conflicts.

Former Pentagon adviser and professor of international law Rosa
Brooks [wrote that](https://mwi.usma.edu/rule-law-gray-zone/) in the
grey zone, 'we don't know what counts as "armed conflict" or "the use of
force"... we're no longer even sure what counts as a weapon'. Former US
Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work [characterized
grey-zone activities](https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/606661/) as
the use of 'agents, paramilitaries, deception, infiltration, and
persistent denial to make those avenues of approach very hard to
detect'.

Who advocates or subscribes to it?

The rapid spread of grey-zone warfare as a concept led to institutional
change and the development of a dedicated research industry. Among many
examples, the US Army financed a research programme at the RAND
Corporation for '[competing in the
gray zone](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2942.html)' and
'[gaming gray
zone tactics](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2915.html)'.
Similarly, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the US
created a 'gray zone project' to investigate 'the toolkit for coercion
below the level of direct warfare \[including\] information operations,
political coercion, economic coercion, cyber operations, proxy support,
and provocation by state-controlled forces.

But even when adopting grey-zone terminology, many practitioners
recognized that it described aspects of warfare that were already
familiar. Former commander of US Special Operations Command Joseph Votel
is considered [one of
the first](https://ndupress.ndu.edu/JFQ/Joint-Force-Quarterly-80/article/643108/unconventional-warfare-in-the-gray-zone/) senior
military figures to describe the grey zone. Speaking at NATO Special
Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) in September 2015, Votel noted that his
presentation had initially been drafted with references to 'hybrid
warfare', which had been replaced with 'grey zone' at the last minute to
reflect the fashion of the day.

Why is it wrong?

The field of Russian military studies has been saturated with
definitional debates since 2014. This chapter does not join that
conversation but instead focuses on the practical impact of
misunderstanding Russian concepts of operations. It argues that the
Western notion of Russian grey-zone warfare misconstrues key elements of
both ambiguity and legality.

[**Grey-zone warfare** is seen to take place in a notional area 'between
war and peace'. But it is clear this is really nothing new if the
definition of 'war' is considered according to the core tenets of
international law]{.underline}

Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, [[ambiguity]{.mark}
was seen to [be at the **core** of Russian warfare]{.mark}. But there
was [**rarely** genuine doubt]{.mark} as to [Russia's actions]{.mark}.
While the [soldiers entering Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 [wore unmarked
uniforms]{.mark}, they were [**not impossible** to identify]{.mark}.
Instead, the ploy [exploited the [unwillingness of
Western leaders](https://warontherocks.com/2016/03/russian-hybrid-warfare-and-other-dark-arts/) to
identify them]{.mark} because that would mean they needed to
act.]{.underline}

[[Russian **interference** in]{.mark} the **2016 [US]{.mark}
presidential [election]{.mark}** was similarly [not ambiguous]{.mark}.
Although it relied on a mix of hack and leak operations, and flooding
social media with information operations, [there was a **high degree of
awareness**]{.mark} among [US intelligence]{.mark} agencies and [by
President]{.mark} Barack [Obama]{.mark} as to [what was
happening]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [Obama warned
Vladimir Putin](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/obama-putin-232754) in
a face-to-face meeting in September 2016 that Russia should 'cut it out'
regarding election interference.

[Notably, this [warning]{.mark} was [given **weeks** before Russian
military]{.mark} intelligence [leaked]{.mark} the [emails]{.mark} from
the Democratic National Committee,]{.underline} which became the most
obvious example of election interference. [US intelligence agencies have
consistently shown a striking [degree of **insight**
and visibility](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/six-russian-gru-officers-charged-connection-worldwide-deployment-destructive-malware-and) into
Russian operations.]{.underline}

[Yet again, the problem with [Russian election interference]{.mark} had
[**little** to do]{.mark} with [ambiguity]{.mark}, but rather a
[lack]{.mark} of determination [to stop the Russian leadership]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} taking [action]{.mark} that was known to be
imminent.]{.underline} This was a classical deterrence problem, where
the US exhortation to 'cut it out' lacked a credible 'or else' which
could have changed the Russian calculus.

The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is an example par excellence of how
Russian warfare exploits a lack of determination rather than ambiguity.
As early as 4 December 2021, [the New York Times published [[reports
from
US]{.mark} intelligence](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/04/us/politics/russia-ukraine-biden.html) [stating
Russia]{.mark} was going to [build]{.mark} up [a force]{.mark} of
[175,000 troops]{.mark} for a possible invasion -- and yet, despite
awareness-raising campaigns by the US and the UK, [European
leaders]{.mark} preferred to [believe [until the
last minute](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60938538)]{.mark} there
would [be no invasion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Grey-zone warfare is seen to take place in a notional area 'between war
and peace'. But it is clear this is really nothing new if the definition
of 'war' is considered according to the core tenets of international
law. To start with, the UN Charter -- the main source of international
law -- has only one mention of war, and it is in the preamble, not the
operative paragraphs. Instead, the UN Charter prohibits the use of force
or threat thereof against the [territorial integrity and
political independence](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter) of
any state. The examples of Russian grey-zone warfare cited above are
clear transgressions of this.

The idea of a space between war and peace also presupposes that a
declared state of war is a relevant phenomenon from a legal point of
view. The last time the US formally declared war was during the Second
World War -- so in effect, all US conflicts since then have been in a
grey zone between war and peace. And the last time Moscow declared war
was in the Soviet--Japanese war in 1945, also within the context of the
Second World War.

The central Article 51 states that 'nothing in the present Charter shall
impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence'.
This is notable as the inherent right to self-defence, by definition,
predates the UN Charter and is defined by customary international law,
which was never meant to render a defender defenceless just because the
attacker's choice of weapons is not specified in the UN Charter.

What is its impact on policy?

[If we believe that the primary utility in Russian grey-zone warfare
comes from its ambiguity or its ability to exploit legal difficulties,
international responses will tend to focus on processes and tools for
attribution,]{.underline} as well as on updating international and
national law. However, if -- as this chapter argues -- there is good
insight into much of what is happening, but determination is lacking,
the problem is a different one.

[The key problem with the notion of [Russia's grey-zone warfare]{.mark}
is that it [absolves the international community]{.mark} [of the need to
act]{.mark}. The concept declares that [Russia has managed to]{.mark}
find a way to [attack the West]{.mark} in places [where it is unable to
defend]{.mark} itself. This notion [breeds passivity rather than the
proactivity]{.mark} needed to confront the challenge.]{.underline}

peace, victory versus defeat---and to divide military operations into
discrete phases may limit our ability to grapple with problems that are
inherently messy and ambiguous. Adversaries understand all this, of

[[Gray zone]{.mark} challenges can be [productive]{.mark}]{.underline}
and counterproductive at the same time

In light of the advantages that gray zone approaches offer, and the
difficulties and complexities involved in combating them, it can be
tempting to think that America's adversaries have hit upon a devilishly
clever strategy for undermining the international order. And to be
clear, the threat is very real. China's coercive gradualism has
strengthened its military position in the South China Sea, and
positioned Beijing to assert greater influence over that area. Russian
hybrid warfare activities have dismembered Ukraine, created another
"frozen conflict" that can be intensified at Moscow's discretion, and
cast a pall of insecurity over Eastern Europe. Iranian subversive
activities in the Middle East have further inflamed and destabilized
that region, and proven highly unsettling to American partners and
allies. There is no waving away these challenges---gray zone approaches
are testing key regional orders, and key elements of the international
order writ large.

[Yet it is still [**not clear** how effective]{.mark} these
[strategies]{.mark} will be **[over time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
[[even if gray zone]{.mark} approaches [are effective]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} achieving their [[short]{.mark} [and
medium]{.mark}-[term]{.mark} goals]{.underline}, the [[long-term
results]{.mark} are still **[hazier]{.mark}** and potentially [more
problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider again China's recent
activities. [[Chinese assertiveness]{.mark} in the South China
Sea]{.underline} has [[driven]{.mark} many regional [countries to pursue
closer **security ties**]{.mark} **[with
Washington]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it has [helped **[revitalize the
U.S.-Philippines alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and it has
[[inspired]{.mark} precisely the **[more assertive Japanese
foreign]{.mark} and defense [policies]{.mark}** that Beijing likely

[military]{.mark}]{.underline} and territorial [position in the

While [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} accepts the possible use of [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} as a legitimate battlefield tactic, and its
[[threshold for]{.mark} such [use is **far**]{.mark} [**lower**
than]{.mark} for [Western]{.mark} nuclear [powers]{.mark}, its
[persistent nuclear threats]{.mark} should be recognized as
[primarily]{.mark} [**political posturing** unrelated to any
probable]{.mark} nuclear [use]{.mark}.]{.underline}

What is the myth?

The circumstances under which Russia might use nuclear weapons have been
the subject of lengthy and heated debate. This is in part because of
mixed messages from Russia itself. [Published nuclear doctrine describes
a [very **limited** set of circumstances]{.mark} [predicating]{.mark} a
[nuclear response]{.mark} by Russia.]{.underline} But this is at odds
with consistent public rhetoric from President Vladimir Putin down
through the entire information apparatus of the Russian state, which has
frequently made both implicit and explicit nuclear threats.

[Russia's nuclear rhetoric is incessant and emphasizes readiness to use
these weapons. But its aim is to extract the maximum possible practical
value from their mere possession, with or without actual intent to
use.]{.underline} The impact of these threats builds on an intensive and
highly effective programme by Russia's extended network of influencers
abroad promising almost inevitable escalation to nuclear war if Russia's
plans are opposed. While the constant Russian nuclear refrain suggests
greater willingness to consider nuclear use in real life, in turn based
on Russia's demonstrated greater willingness to inflict mass destruction
and mass casualties in pursuit of its aims, [the [rationale
behind]{.mark} these [threats is to increase Russia's]{.mark} own
[operational latitude]{.mark} [without actually having to go to
war]{.mark}, by undermining Western will to resist.]{.underline}

This campaign has been effective in [[**creating an impression** that
Russia has an exceptionally low threshold]{.mark} for nuclear
use]{.underline}, and [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[wide range
of]{.mark} circumstances or '[provocations' could]{.mark} cause that
threshold to be [cross]{.mark}ed]{.underline}.

Who advocates or subscribes to it?

In a January 2022 joint statement by the five main nuclear powers,
Russia was said to have reaffirmed that 'nuclear war cannot be won and
must never be fought'. The text in Russian, however, says instead that
nuclear war must not be razvyazana -- 'unleashed' or 'allowed to get out
of hand'. In practice, Russia continues to threaten nuclear use against
its adversaries regardless of any such commitment. [Strident nuclear
discourse has in fact become an integral part of Russia's domestic war
rhetoric]{.underline}, incessantly rammed home by state propaganda.

Russia's message of 'catastrophic escalation' is routinely endorsed by
sympathetic commentators and academics abroad. The resulting success of
Russia's nuclear threats in deterring international countermeasures has
been striking, with even defence chiefs from NATO nations directly
echoing Russian talking points.

Russia's doctrine provides for nuclear first use in a conventional war
when the country's 'very existence' is at risk. But this has not
prevented a wide range of risks in any war, even one started by Russia,
being described as existential. It is argued that there need not even be
a war. International sanctions and even 'aggressive statements' by
Russia's victims have repeatedly proved sufficient to trigger renewed
nuclear threats.

Western political leaders have themselves confirmed that Russia has
succeeded in shaping their behaviour through nuclear intimidation. This
is made most explicit in the artificial limitations on aid and support
to Ukraine, which Western powers have explicitly, and misguidedly,
linked to fear of a nuclear response by Russia.

Why is it wrong?

A wide range of experienced analysts outside Russia have concluded that,
as opposed to threatened use for coercion or military advantage,
Russia's nuclear weapons would only actually be used in extremis. This
view holds that [[Russia's nuclear arms are a political,]{.mark}
[defensive deterrent]{.mark}, and thus **[unlikely to be
employed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It further suggests that advances in
[Russia's conventional capabilities have made it less likely to need to
resort to the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} A third, related
argument holds that an 'escalate to de-escalate' approach --
demonstrative use of nuclear weapons as a war termination or prevention
strategy -- is not among the options Russia would consider. The debate
is further complicated by the layering of Russia's nuclear capabilities,
from non-strategic to strategic weapons.

The contributions of Russian commentators on nuclear policy should be
treated with scepticism, but in many cases they too have played down the
likelihood of nuclear use. The arms control specialist Nikolai Sokov
holds that Russia's nuclear doctrine is defensive and that it reserves
nuclear use 'exclusively for situations when Russia is attacked', albeit
in a broader range of circumstances than the widely recognized criterion
of an attack 'which threatens the existence of the state itself'.
Meanwhile, the former Russian military intelligence officer and Carnegie
Moscow analyst Dmitri Trenin has argued that the notion of a limited
nuclear war has always been 'alien' to Russian strategy.

Informed analysts outside Russia have also noted a trend for the
threshold for Russian nuclear use to become higher, not lower, as
Moscow's conventional military capabilities have improved from their
nadir in the 2000s. Kristin Ven Bruusgaard observed in 2017 that
'[[Russia today is]{.mark} **[less]{.mark}**, not more [likely to use
nuc]{.mark}lear weapons [than it was 10 or 15 years
ago']{.mark}.]{.underline} Olga Oliker has also argued there is little
evidence Russia has lowered its threshold for nuclear use. 'Rather,
Russia's statements and behavior indicate more a desire to leverage its
status as a nuclear power,' she says.

Can you [explain]{.underline} what [the mechanism]{.underline} is
[whereby **biodiversity loss** creates existential risk?]{.underline}
And if biodiversity loss is an existential risk, how big a risk is it?
Should 80k be getting people to go into conservation science or not?

There are independent reasons to think that the risk is negligible.
Firstly, according to wikipedia, [during the Eocene period]{.underline}
\~65m years ago, [there were **thousands fewer genera** than
today]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} have [made **\~1%** of species
extinct, and [we]{.mark} would [have to continue]{.mark}]{.underline} at
[**[current]{.mark} rates of species [extinctions]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
**at least [200 years]{.mark}** [to return to **Eocene**]{.mark}
**levels of bio[diversity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And yet, even though
significantly warmer than today, [the Eocene marked the dawn of
thousands of new species]{.underline}. So, [[**why**
would]{.underline}]{.mark} we expect [[the world]{.mark} 200 years
hence]{.underline} to [[be **inhospitable**]{.mark} **to humans** [if it
**wasn\'t**]{.mark} **inhospitable** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} all of
the [[species]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging [[in **the Eocene**,
who]{.underline}]{.mark} are/[[were]{.mark} **significantly [less
numerous]{.mark}** [than humans and]{.mark} **significantly [less
capable]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **[rational response]{.mark} to
problems?**]{.underline}

Secondly, as far as I am aware, [[ev]{.mark}idence
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} pressure-induced [non-linear [ecosystem shifts
is]{.mark} **very [limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is true for a
range of ecosystems. Linear ecosystem damage seems to be the norm. If
so, [[this leaves]{.mark} **more [scope]{.mark}** [for learning
**about**]{.mark} **the costs** of our damage to ecosystems [and
correcting]{.mark} any **[damage]{.mark} we have done**]{.underline}.

Thirdly, [ecosystem services are]{.underline} overwhelmingly [a
function]{.underline} of the relations [within **local** ecosystems,
rather than of **global**]{.underline} trends in
[biodiversity]{.underline}. Upon discovering Hawaii, the Polynesians
eliminated so many species that global decadal extinction rates would
have been exceptional. This has next to no bearing on ecosystem services
outside Hawaii. [[Humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} is an intelligent
species and [[will be able to]{.mark} see]{.underline} if [other
regions]{.underline} are [suffering from biodiversity loss and **[make
adjustments]{.mark} accordingly**]{.underline}. Why would all regions be
so stupid as to ignore lessons from elsewhere? Also, is biodiversity
actually decreasing in the rich world? I know forest cover is increasing
in many places. Population is set to decline in many rich countries in
the near future, and environmental impact per person is declining on
many metrics.

I also find it surprising that you cite [the **Kareiva** and Carranza
paper]{.underline} in [support]{.underline} of your
[claims]{.underline}, for this paper in fact directly contradicts them:

\"The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. One boundary often mentioned as a concern for the fate of
global civilization is biodiversity (Ehrlich & Ehrlich, 2012), with the
proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than 0.001% per year
(Rockström et al., 2009). There is little evidence that this particular
0.001% annual loss is a threshold---and it is hard to imagine any data
that would allow one to identify where the threshold was (Brook, Ellis,
Perring, Mackay, & Blomqvist, 2013; Lenton & Williams, 2013). A better
question is whether one can imagine any scenario by which the loss of
too many species leads to the collapse of societies and environmental
disasters, even though one cannot know the absolute number of
extinctions that would be required to create this dystopia.

[While]{.underline} there are [data]{.underline} that [relate [**local
reductions** in species]{.mark}]{.underline} richness [to altered
ecosystem function, these results do not point to]{.underline}
substantial [existential risks]{.underline}. The [data are **small-scale
experiments** in]{.underline} which [plant productivity]{.underline},
[or nutrient retention]{.underline} is reduced as species numbers
decline locally (Vellend, 2017), [or]{.underline} are
[local]{.underline} observations of increased [variability in fisheries
yield]{.underline} when stock diversity is lost (Schindler et al.,
2010). [Those [are not **existential**]{.mark} **risks**]{.underline}.
To make the link even more tenuous, [[there is **little
ev**]{.mark}**idence**]{.underline} that [[biod]{.mark}iversity [is
**even declining**]{.mark} **at local scales**]{.underline} (Vellend et
al., 2013, Vellend et al., 2017). Total [planetary biodiversity
may]{.underline} be in [decline, but local and regional
biodiversity]{.underline} is often [stay]{.underline}ing [the same
[because]{.mark} **species from [elsewhere]{.mark}** [replace]{.mark}
**local [losses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, albeit homogenizing the world in
the process. [Although]{.underline} the majority of [**conservation
[scientists]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} likely]{.underline} to [flinch at
this]{.underline} conclusion, [there is [growing
skeptic]{.mark}ism]{.underline} regarding the strength [[of
ev]{.mark}idence [linking]{.mark}]{.underline} trends in
[**[biod]{.mark}iversity [loss]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} an
**[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}** [for humans]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014). [Obviously [if **all
biod**]{.mark}**iversity** [disappeared civilization **would**
end]{.mark}---[but **no one**]{.mark} is [forecast]{.mark}ing the [loss
of **all**]{.mark} **species**]{.underline}. It seems plausible that the
loss of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but not
one is predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic, but
plausible is the possibility of our planet suffering a loss of as many
as half of its species. [[If]{.mark} **global
[biod]{.mark}**]{.underline}iversity were
**[[halved]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but at the same time locally the
number of species stayed relatively stable, [what would be the mechanism
for]{.underline} an [end-of-civilization]{.underline} or even end of
human prosperityscenario[?]{.underline} Extinctions and [biodiversity
loss are]{.underline} ethical and spiritual losses, but perhaps
[[not]{.mark} an **[existential]{.mark} risk**]{.underline}.\"

[percent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **marine [genera]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(plural of genus) [[and **seventy percent** of]{.mark} **land
[vertebrate]{.mark}** [vanished]{.mark} for good]{.underline}. Even
insects suffered a mass extinction -- the only time before or since.
[**Entire classes** of animals]{.underline} -- like trilobites -- [went
out like a match in the wind]{.underline}.

But [what's]{.underline} arguably [most fascinating about]{.underline}
this event -- known as the Permian-Triassic extinction or more
poetically, [**the Great Dying** -- is]{.underline} the fact [that
anything survived at all. [Life]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems, [[is
**so**]{.mark} **ridiculously [adaptable]{.mark}**]{.underline} that not
only did [**[thousands]{.mark} of species** [make it
through]{.mark}]{.underline} whatever killed off nearly everything (no
one knows for certain though theories abound) but, somehow, after
millions of years life even recovered and went on to write new tales.

Even as **[[the]{.mark} Permian-[Triassic
extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** event shows the fragility of life, it
also proves its resilience in the long-term. The lessons of such mass
extinctions -- five to date and arguably a sixth happening as I write --
inform science today. Given that extinction levels are currently 1,000
(some even say 10,000) times the background rate, researchers have long
worried about our current destruction of biodiversity -- and what that
may mean for our future Earth and ourselves.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

["It makes no sense that there exists a [tipping point of
**biod**]{.mark}**iversity loss** [beyond which]{.mark} **the
[Earth]{.mark}** [will collapse]{.mark}," said]{.underline} co-author
and ecologist, [José **Montoya**]{.underline}, with Paul Sabatier
Univeristy in France. "There is no rationale for this."

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

[Montoya]{.underline}, Donohue and Pimm [argue]{.underline} that [[there
**isn't ev**]{.mark}**idence**]{.underline} of a point at which loss of
species leads to ecosystem collapse, [[**globally** or]{.mark} **even
[locally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[If the planet didn't collapse after
**the**]{.mark} **Permian-[Triassic]{.mark} extinction** event, [it
**won't**]{.mark} **collapse [now]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- though our
descendants may well curse us for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
the [[damage is **gradual**]{.mark} and incremental, [not]{.mark} a
**[sudden]{.mark} plunge**]{.underline}.
[[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to them, [[**slowly
degrade** but **never fail**]{.mark} **outright**]{.underline}.

"[[Of]{.mark} **more than [600 experiments]{.mark}** of
biodiversity]{.underline} effects on various functions, [[**none**
showed]{.mark} a [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}," Montoya said. "In
general, [the loss of species has a detrimental effect on ecosystem
functions]{.underline}\...[We progressively lose
pollination]{.underline} services, [water quality, plant biomass,
and]{.underline} many [other]{.underline} important
[functions]{.underline} as we lose species. [But]{.underline} we
[never]{.underline} observe a critical level of biodiversity over which
functions [collapse]{.underline}."

[Nearly [three years after]{.mark} the Deepwater [Horizon]{.mark} drill
rig exploded and the busted Macondo Well spewed millions of gallons of
crude into the Gulf of Mexico, [scientists are]{.mark} still [trying to
figure out]{.mark} to [what happened to all the oil. Only]{.mark} a
[tiny amount was captured]{.mark} or burned at the surface, and vast
quantity]{.underline} --- nobody knows exactly how much --- [was
"dispersed" with chemicals injected directly into the stream of oil
streaming out of the broken pipes, **[but]{.mark} a surprisingly [large
percentage]{.mark} of the oil may [have been broken down by
microbes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of the oil settled to the
seafloor, damaging coral miles from the site of the disaster. There's
also evidence that the oil damaged Gulf of Mexico oysters growing in
coastal areas, and sickened dolphins in Barataria Bay. And in Florida,
researchers found remnants of the oil lingering in "scary high"
concentrations in the splash zone along Gulf beaches. But [overall, the
[Gulf may be]{.mark} **more [resilient]{.mark} than previously
believed**, according to Terry Hazen a bioremediation expert at the
University of Tennessee-Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Hazen and his
research team used a [powerful new approach]{.mark} for identifying
microbes in the environment to [discover]{.mark} previously
[unknown]{.mark} and naturally occurring [bacteria that consume and
break down]{.mark} crude [oil]{.mark}. They concluded that [there was a
population explosion]{.mark} among those bacteria already adapted to
using oil as a food source. "It was surprising how fast they consumed
the oil]{.underline}," Hazen said. "[In some locations, it took only one
day for them to reduce a gallon of oil to a half gallon]{.underline}. In
others, the half-life for a given quantity of spilled oil was six days
... **["The Deepwater Horizon [oil provided]{.mark} a new source of
[nutrients]{.mark} in the deepest waters,"]{.underline}** he said.
Rather than culturing the microbes in a lab, the researchers combined
genetic data and other analyses of the DNA, proteins and other
footprints of bacteria to provide a more detailed picture of microbial
life in the water. **[Their [findings suggest]{.mark} that a great
[potential for]{.mark} intrinsic [bioremediation]{.mark}]{.underline}**
of oil plumes exists in the deep sea and other environs in the Gulf of
Mexico. Oil-eating bacteria are natural inhabitants of the Gulf because
of the constant supply of oil as food. "The bottom line from this
research may be that the Gulf of Mexico is more resilient and better
able to recover from oil spills than anyone thought," Hazen said. "It
shows that we may not need the kinds of heroic measures proposed after
the Deepwater Horizon spill, like adding nutrients to speed up the
growth of bacteria that break down oil or using genetically engineered
bacteria. The Gulf has a broad base of natural bacteria, and they
respond to the presence of oil by multiplying quite rapidly." Hazen
recently presented his Deepwater Horizon disaster research findings at
the 245th National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical
Society, the world's largest scientific society.

We argue that at the [[global]{.underline}]{.mark}-scale, ecological
["[tipping points]{.mark}" and threshold-like "planetary boundaries"
[are **improbable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [[shifts]{.mark} in
the Earth's biosphere [follow a **gradual**, **smooth
pattern**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This means]{.underline} that [it might
be [**impossible** to **define**]{.mark} **scientifically**]{.underline}
specific, [[critical]{.mark} levels of **[biod]{.mark}iversity
[loss]{.mark}**]{.underline} or land-use change. This has important
consequences for both science and policy.

Humans are causing changes in ecosystems across Earth to such a degree
that there is now broad agreement that we live in an epoch of our own
making: the Anthropocene. But the question of just how these changes
will play out --- and especially whether we might be approaching a
planetary tipping point with abrupt, global-scale consequences --- has
remained unsettled.

A tipping point occurs when an ecosystem attribute, such as species
abundance or carbon sequestration, responds abruptly and possibly
irreversibly to a human pressure, such as land-use or climate change.
Many local- and regional-level ecosystems, such as lakes, forests and
grasslands, behave this way. Recently however, there have been several
efforts to define ecological tipping points at the global scale.

[At a local scale, there are]{.underline} definitely warning [signs that
an ecosystem is about to "tip"]{.underline}. For the terrestrial
biosphere, tipping points might be expected if ecosystems across Earth
respond in similar ways to human pressures and these pressures are
uniform, or if there are strong connections between continents that
allow for rapid diffusion of impacts across the planet.

[These]{.underline} criteria [are]{.underline}, however,
[unlikely]{.underline} to be met [in the real world]{.underline}.

First, [[ecosystems on]{.mark} **different [continents]{.mark}** [are
**not**]{.mark} **strongly [connected]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Organisms are **limited in**]{.mark} **their [movement]{.mark}** [by
**oceans** and **mountain**]{.mark} **range[s]{.mark}**, as well as by
**climatic factors**]{.underline}, and while ecosystem change in one
region can affect the global circulation of, for example, greenhouse
gases, this signal is likely to be weak in comparison with inputs from
fossil fuel combustion and deforestation.

Second, [the [responses of ecosystems]{.mark} to human
pressures]{.underline} like climate change or land-use change [[depend
on **local circumstances** and will]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
**[[differ]{.mark} between locations]{.underline}**. From a
[planetary]{.underline} perspective, this [diversity in ecosystem
responses creates a]{.underline}n essentially [**gradual pattern** of
change, without any identifiable tipping points]{.underline}.

Steffen et al (2015) revise the "planetary boundaries framework"
initially proposed in 2009 as the "safe limits" for human alteration of
Earth processes(Rockstrom et al 2009). Limiting human harm to
environments is a major challenge and we applaud all efforts to increase
the public utility of global-change science. Yet [the planetary
boundaries]{.underline} (PB) [framework]{.underline} -- in its original
form and as revised by Steffen et al -- [**obscures** rather than
**clarifies** the environmental and sustainability challenges faced by
humanity]{.underline} this century.

Steffen et al concede that "[[not **all**]{.mark} **Earth system
[processes]{.mark}**]{.underline} included in the PB [[have]{.mark}
**singular [thresholds]{.mark}** [at the
global]{.mark}]{.underline}/continental/ocean basin
[[level]{.underline}]{.mark}." [**[Such]{.mark} processes** [include
**bio**]{.mark}**sphere [integrity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Brook et
al 2013), [biogeochemical flows, freshwater use, and land-system
change]{.underline}. "Nevertheless," they continue, "it is important
that boundaries be established for these processes." Why? [Where a
global threshold is unknown]{.underline} or lacking, [[there is **no
scientific**]{.mark}**ally robust [way]{.mark}** [of specifying]{.mark}
such [a boundary -- **determining**]{.mark} **a limit**]{.underline}
along a continuum of environmental change [[becomes]{.mark} a matter of
**[guesswork]{.mark}** or **speculation**]{.underline} (see e.g. Bass
2009;Nordhaus et al 2012). For instance, the land-system boundary for
temperate forest is set at 50% of forest cover remaining. [There is **no
robust justification** for why this boundary should not be]{.underline}
40%, or 70%, or [some other level]{.underline}.

While the stated objective of [the **[PB]{.mark}
framework**]{.underline} is to "guide human societies" away from a state
of the Earth system that is "less hospitable to the development of human
societies", it [[offers **little scientific ev**]{.mark}**idence** [to
support]{.mark} the [connection between]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[global]{.underline}]{.mark} state of specific [**Earth system
[processes]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **human
[well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, **[[the]{.mark} Holocene
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the most recent 10,000 years)
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} assumed to be [[ideal. Yet]{.mark} most
species evolved before the Holocene and **[the]{.mark} contemporary
[ecosystems]{.mark}** [that sustain humanity are
**agro**]{.mark}**ecosystems**, **[urban]{.mark} ecosystems**
[and]{.mark} other **[human-altered]{.mark} ecosystems**]{.underline}
that in themselves represent some of the most important global and local
environmental changes that characterize the Anthropocene. Contrary to
the authors' claim that the Holocene is the "only state of the planet
that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies," the
[**human-[altered]{.mark}** [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
Anthropocene [[represent **the only** state]{.mark} of the planet
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} we know [**for certain [can]{.mark}**
[support]{.mark} contemporary [civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Human alteration of environments produces multiple effects, some
advantageous to societies, such as enhanced food production, and some
detrimental, like environmental pollution with toxic chemicals, excess
nutrients and carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and the loss of
wildlife and their habitats. The key to better environmental outcomes is
not in ending human alteration of environments but in anticipating and
mitigating their negative consequences. These decisions and trade-offs
should be guided by robust evidence, with global-change science
investigating the connections and tradeoffs between the state of the
environment and human well-being in the context of the local setting,
rather than by framing and reframing environmental challenges in terms
of untestable assumptions about the virtues of past environments.

Even without specifying exact global boundaries, [global metrics can be
highly misleading for policy]{.underline}. For example, with nitrogen,
where the majority of human emissions come from synthetic fertilizers,
the real-world challenge is to apply just the right amount of nitrogen
to optimize crop yields while minimizing nitrogen losses that harm
aquatic ecosystems. Reducing fertilizer application in Africa might seem
beneficial globally, yet the result in this region would be even poorer
crop yields without any notable reduction in nitrogen pollution;
Africa's fertilizer use is already suboptimal for crop yields. [[What
can look]{.underline}]{.mark} like a [good or]{.underline} a
[[bad]{.underline}]{.mark} thing [[**globally** can
prove]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly [[the opposite]{.underline}]{.mark}
when viewed regionally and **[[locally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [What use
is a global indicator for a local issue?]{.underline} As in real estate,
[location is everything]{.underline}.

Levels of [[biodiversity in]{.underline}]{.mark} the world\'s
[[oceans]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[remained]{.underline}]{.mark}
virtually **[[unchanged]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for hundreds of
millions of years]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to a new study
published
in [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6489/420).

The conclusion that [marine biodiversity]{.underline} has [stayed
stable]{.underline} over [time and not mushroomed over]{.underline} the
last [200 million]{.underline} years or so challenges existing
assumptions that there has been a steady diversification of species, say
the study\'s authors.

\"Our paper rejects past hypotheses that marine diversity today is
higher than ever before, due to sustained increases over the last 200
million years. Rather, we find that levels of diversity today are likely
not that different from levels hundreds of millions of years ago,\" lead
author Dr. Roger Close, a paleobiologist at the University of Birmingham
in the U.K., told Newsweek.

\"This may have implications for the way we understand modern
biodiversity and conservation.\"

According to Close, the assumption that biodiversity levels increase at
least partially stems from a methodological error---the global fossil
record it hinges on is not really global. It is more fractured than the
name suggests, varying in geographic reach and continuity, which leads
to skewed results.

\"The fact that [the \'global\' fossil record isn\'t]{.underline} really
[global]{.underline} hasn\'t been widely acknowledged before now,\" said
Close. But [[new computer models]{.underline}]{.mark} able to [[identify
patterns in]{.underline}]{.mark} regional-scale
[[diversity]{.underline}]{.mark} have enabled Close and his team to
analyze shifts in biodiversity levels across time and space from the
beginning of the Cambrian Explosion, approximately 540 million years
ago, to the present day.

The results suggest that [global biodiversity]{.underline} levels [did
not increase in]{.underline} a [sustained fashion for
extended]{.underline} periods of [time]{.underline}. Rather **[it
remained stable]{.underline}**. However, [[the team did notice
differences]{.mark} in levels [on a **regional
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with [[coral reefs]{.underline}]{.mark}
historically [[displaying]{.mark} some of the **[greatest
variety]{.mark}** of species]{.underline}---as they do today.

\"[When you look at]{.underline} these [individual animal
groups]{.underline}, you can see [fluctuations in diversity]{.underline}
that [are often substantial]{.underline}. But [taken
together]{.underline}, these **[[patterns sum to]{.mark} one of
[constrained diversity]{.mark},]{.underline}**\" Close said in a
statement.

\"Some [[groups]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[benefit
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[misfortune of
others]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the [overall levels of
diversity]{.underline} that we see have [remained fairly stable for
hundreds of millions of years]{.underline}.\"

According to Close, [understanding]{.underline} how
[biodiversity]{.underline} came to exist [over deep time offers
important context for today\'s biodiversity---as well as]{.underline}
how it may change in [the future]{.underline}.

This may be particularly relevant today given a number of [recent
studies suggesting marine biodiversity is under serious threat, from
disappearing coral reefs to accelerating rates of species
extinction]{.underline}. According to a study recently published in One
Earth, more than a quarter of the world\'s oceans must be protected to
preserve marine biodiversity.

If current trends continue, would Close expect to see notable declines
of biodiversity on the fossil record or does he think it would be
followed by a subsequent boom in biodiversity levels?

[Close points to [the Cretaceous Period]{.mark}]{.underline} 66 million
years ago, when [an extinction event [wiped out]{.mark} roughly [half
of]{.mark} all plant and animal [species]{.mark}]{.underline} (most
notably non-avian dinosaurs). The study suggests it was [[followed
by]{.mark} a dramatic [shift in biodiversity]{.mark}
levels]{.underline}, with an expanding roster of [[new
species]{.underline}]{.mark}---and gastropods in particular---that
[[took advantage]{.mark} of the space left behind.]{.underline}

\"We find a [rapid recovery of diversity levels]{.underline} after the
last mass extinction 66 million years ago---in fact, to [levels even
higher than before]{.underline} (although the time resolution of our
study is fairly low),\" said Close. \"[Past work]{.underline} has
[suggested]{.underline} that [[biodiversity]{.mark} would **[recover
from anthropogenic extinction]{.mark}** within a few million
years.]{.underline}

\"So long after we\'re gone, [biodiversity will likely bounce back to
levels seen for tens to hundreds of millions of years]{.underline}. But
it will take hundreds of thousands to millions of years, and it depends
how badly we mess up the natural environment.\"

## Arctic Warming

### AT: Arctic Warming\-\--Models Wrong\-\--1NC

#### [Current models]{.underline} for Arctic warming are [inaccurate]{.underline} -- warming will [stabilize]{.underline} and feedback loops are [exaggerated]{.underline}

**Kyushu 25** -- Kyushu University is a public research university
located in Fukuoka, Japan, on the island of Kyushu. It has been
recognized as a leading institution of higher education and research in
Kyushu and Japan. (6-9-2025; "Scientists Uncover Flaw in Climate Models:
Clouds Are Supercharging Arctic Warming";
https://scitechdaily.com/scientists-uncover-flaw-in-climate-models-clouds-are-supercharging-arctic-warming/)//CMSW-ShajSpec

The key may lie in Arctic clouds during winter, as [[climate models tend
to underestimate]{.mark} how much liquid they contain and how much heat
they retain]{.underline}. This [[leads to **inaccurate
predictions**]{.mark} of future warming]{.underline}.

The [Arctic is one of the coldest regions on Earth]{.underline}, but in
recent decades it has been warming rapidly, three to four times faster
than the global average. Yet current [climate [models]{.mark} have
[struggled to explain]{.mark}]{.underline} this accelerated
[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now, [researchers from Kyushu University]{.underline}---graduate student
Momoka Nakanishi of the Interdisciplinary Graduate School of Engineering
Sciences and her adviser, Associate Professor Takuro Michibata of the
Research Institute for Applied Mechanics---have [suggested that
[clouds]{.mark} may be [the key factor]{.mark}.]{.underline} Their
findings were published in the journal Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research.

Heat-trapping properties of mixed-phase clouds

The [most]{.underline} [common clouds in the Arctic are mixed-phase
clouds]{.underline}, which contain both ice crystals and supercooled
liquid water droplets. During the Arctic summer, when sunlight is
constant, these clouds reflect sunlight back into space like a parasol,
helping to cool the region. In contrast, during the long, dark Arctic
winter, when there is no sunlight to reflect, the same clouds behave
like a blanket, trapping heat radiated from the Earth's surface and
sending it back down to the ground.

"However, [[how]{.mark} [well these]{.mark} mixed-phase [clouds trap
heat depends on their ratio of ice to liquid]{.mark}]{.underline},"
explains Nakanishi. "The more liquid water the clouds contain, the
better they are at trapping heat. But [[many]{.mark} climate
[models]{.mark} [have a large bias]{.mark} in representing this ratio,
[causing incorrect predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Satellite comparison reveals model bias

In this study, Nakanishi and Michibata analyzed 30 climate models and
compared them to satellite observations of clouds in the Arctic during
winter over the last decade. They found that [[21 of the 30
models]{.mark} [significantly overestimate]{.mark}d the fraction of ice
to liquid in wintertime Arctic clouds]{.underline}.

"These [ice-dominant [models]{.mark} are [not properly accounting
for]{.mark} the [present-day warming]{.mark}]{.underline} potential of
the clouds during the winter," says Nakanishi. "That's why they cannot
account for the rapid warming we are currently seeing."

Illustration of Shifting Ice to Liquid Ratios in Arctic Clouds

In the present climate, mixed-phase clouds have a slightly larger
ice-to-liquid ratio. [As the climate warms, more ice shifts to
liquid,]{.underline} [increasing the amount of heat emitted]{.underline}
from the clouds, [leading to an increased warming effect]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, in the future, [[clouds will contain enough
liquid]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the [heat emitted reaches a
maximum]{.mark}, **[stabilizing the warming
effect]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Credit: Takuro Michibata/ Kyushu
University

However, every cloud has a silver lining. While [climate models
are]{.underline} underestimating the rate of global warming in the
present day, they are [**[overestimating]{.mark}** the [rate of global
warming]{.mark} in the future.]{.underline}

The [errors in future projections are due to a process called "cloud
emissivity feedback]{.underline}". In a nutshell, [as the Arctic
warms]{.underline}, [clouds]{.underline} [shift]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} containing mostly [ice to more liquid]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} [increases]{.underline} their [ability to trap
heat]{.underline}, further warming the Arctic and [creating]{.underline}
a positive [feedback loop]{.underline}.

Liquid-rich clouds and heat feedback saturation

But importantly, this [[feedback loop has a time
limit]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Once clouds become so rich in
liquid]{.underline} that [they behave like
blackbodies]{.underline}---fully absorbing and re-emitting
heat[---[further warming has less effect.]{.underline}]{.mark}

However, because [many [climate models]{.mark} [underestimate]{.mark}
[how much liquid]{.mark} is already [present]{.mark}]{.underline} in
today's clouds, [they [assume a larger shift]{.mark} still lies
ahead]{.underline}. As a result, [they **[overestimate]{.mark}** how
much extra heat-trapping will occur in the future]{.underline}, [[and
predict]{.mark} the [feedback]{.mark} effect [will **last longer than
reality suggests**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Moving forward, the study's findings could be used to refine climate
models so that they provide a more accurate representation of the
ice-to-liquid ratio within clouds and better predictions of current and
future rates of Arctic warming.

Since the Arctic's climate also plays a key role in shaping weather
patterns further south, these [findings could also lead to more accurate
forecasts]{.underline} of extreme weather in mid-latitude regions.

"The biggest uncertainty in our forecasts is due to clouds," concludes
Michibata. "Fixing these models is essential not just for the Arctic,
but for understanding its impact on weather and climate change across
the globe."

models and compared them to satellite observations]{.underline} of
Arctic cloud patterns. They discovered [a widespread modelling
error]{.underline}.

**[Most simulations overestimate]{.underline}** the amount of ice and
underestimate the amount of liquid in wintertime Arctic clouds.

That may [sound like a small detail]{.underline}, but it has [big
consequences for how accurately scientists can predict
warming]{.underline} in one of the world's most sensitive regions.

Clouds could be acting like a thermal blanket over the Arctic

The Arctic is warming three to four times faster than the global
average. A major reason for this is how clouds interact with heat.

In summer, so-called mixed-phase clouds -- which contain both ice
crystals and supercooled liquid water -- reflect sunlight, cooling the
surface. But in the dark winter months, these same clouds trap heat and
insulate the surface like a thermal blanket.

"The [more liquid water these clouds contain, the better they are at
trapping heat]{.underline}," explains study co-author Momoka Nakanishi.

[Most models]{.underline}, however, [suggest that clouds have less
ice]{.underline} in them [than they do.]{.underline} That could [explain
why the rate of Arctic warming in recent decades has outpaced
predictions]{.underline}. It [could]{.underline} also [warp future
projections]{.underline} -- but not in the way you might think.

The **[future may be less dire than it seems]{.underline}** -- but the
present is worse

As the Arctic continues to warm, more ice in clouds converts to liquid,
increasing their heat-trapping power. This creates a [short-term
condition known as "cloud emissivity feedback]{.underline}," which
accelerates warming. [But]{.underline}, the researchers add, **[there's
a limit]{.underline}** to it.

[Once clouds are rich enough]{.underline} in liquid, they [begin to
absorb heat and re-emit it]{.underline} to Earth completely. Meaning,
**[additional warming makes little difference]{.underline}**, because
the clouds are already re-emitting heat to the maximum extent possible.

[Since]{.underline} many [climate models don't accurately
represent]{.underline} how much liquid is already present, they [could
be predicting **greater warming than is likely** in the
future.]{.underline}

In other words, [they **underestimate today's** warming and
**overestimate tomorrow's**]{.underline}.

Fixing this flaw, researchers argue, could improve not just Arctic
projections but also extreme weather forecasts in other parts of the
world, which are influenced by polar systems.

#### The damage is [already done]{.underline} -- nothing the plan can do to stop it

The **[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}** could **[[already]{.mark} be
[done]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The study adds context to another sobering piece of research, published
earlier this month in Communications Earth & Environment.

That [study found]{.underline} that [[even if]{.mark} global [warming is
limited]{.mark} to 1.5°C]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} could [[still
trigger irreversible melting]{.underline}]{.mark} in the massive polar
ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, [[leading sea levels to
rise]{.mark} several metres [**even under optimistic**]{.mark} emissions
[scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Both studies point to the same truth: our understanding of polar
regions, from clouds to ice melt, is still catching up with reality.

If climate models continue to lag observed trends, the world could be
blindsided by faster-than-expected changes in sea level, weather
extremes and ecosystem collapse.

As cloud study co-author Takuro Michibata put it, "Fixing these models
is essential not just for the Arctic, but for understanding its impact
on weather and climate change across the globe."

#### Constraints on [implementation]{.underline} and [government action]{.underline} hamstring mitigation -- tech isn't [key]{.underline}

The ability of some governments to roll out climate policies could push
the world over the Paris Agreement limit.

The [Paris Agreement [target]{.mark}]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
limiting global [warming below 1.5°C]{.underline} above pre-industrial
levels is **[[no longer possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a new study
claims.

[While the [rollout of green tech]{.mark} solutions **has [sped
up]{.mark}** in recent years]{.underline}, the [realistic **[constraints
of implementing]{.mark}** climate policies]{.underline} in some
countries could [[make]{.mark} this totemic **climate [goal
impossible.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[Limiting peak temperature to below 1.5°C]{.underline} is [not possible
with even moderate likelihood anymore]{.underline}," says lead author of
the study Christoph Bertram, associate research professor at the
University of Maryland and guest researcher at the Potsdam Institute for
Climate Impact Research.

In a [new study]{.underline}, published in Nature Climate Change,
Bertram and his colleagues [ran a series of models that took into
account limitations like effective policymaking and
regulation]{.underline}.

The world needs to be prepared for the possibility of an overshoot of
the 1.5°C limit by at least one and probably multiple tenths of a degree
even under the highest possible ambition.

The [**[most ambitious]{.mark}** climate mitigation
[projections]{.mark}]{.underline} [[give the world a **50 per cent
chance**]{.mark} of limiting global warming]{.underline} below 1.6°C
above pre-industrial temperatures.

But, [[if you add in]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[realistic
constraints]{.underline}]{.mark} - such as **[governments\'
capacity]{.underline}** to implement policies like carbon taxes - that
[[likelihood drops to]{.mark} between **[5]{.mark} and 45 [per
cent]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"The world needs to be prepared for the possibility of an overshoot of
the 1.5°C limit by at least one and probably multiple tenths of a degree
even under the highest possible ambition," the study reads.

**[[Policy not technology is holding us back]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Given]{.underline} the most [recent surge in the deployment of various
low-carbon technologies]{.underline} from [solar and wind to electric
vehicles]{.underline}, Bertram says [[tech]{.mark}nological constraints
are [no longer limiting us.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"In North America, Europe and China, given the recent successes of clean
energy deployment, there is large scope for substantial acceleration of
emission reductions, if the right policies are put in place."

He adds that the [main area where governments are currently lacking is
setting ambitious climate targets]{.underline} and [implementing
proportionate policie]{.underline}s. This has **[already been
proven]{.underline}** by a lot of previous research.

What this [study]{.underline} seeks to [show]{.underline} instead is the
[impact of countries which lack the regulatory capacity]{.underline} to
implement effective climate policies on the lowest peak warming still
possible.

[Some [countries **simply don't have the infrastructure**]{.mark} or
bureaucratic systems to effectively enforce policies]{.underline} like
carbon pricing. This [reduces their ability to rapidly
decarbonise]{.underline}.

The team found that these [limitations have a substantial effect
on]{.underline} whether or not we can reach [global climate
goals]{.underline}.

"[Other regions]{.underline}, especially those with lower incomes
[are]{.underline} often [lacking institutional capacities]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} effective [decarbonisation policies]{.underline},"
Bertram says.

Other regions, especially those with lower incomes are often lacking
institutional capacities for effective decarbonisation policies.

Christoph Bertram

Lead author of the study

"In order to support faster decarbonisation in these regions,
international support to increase institutional capacities and to make
deployment of clean technologies cheaper and easier for these countries
is needed."

[[Even limiting warming to 1.6°C will require **huge political
will**]{.underline}]{.mark} from higher-income countries.

The EU\'s first task, for example, should be accelerating its green
transition. While member states are doing well in reducing emissions
from the power sector, more ambition is needed in transport, buildings
and industry.

Being a frontrunner in technologies like heat pumps or electric vehicles
helps to further bring down costs and makes it easier for other
countries to deploy them. The EU can also help build out institutions
that would enable faster decarbonisation elsewhere, Bertram adds.

stage. [[Over 70%]{.mark} of the [observations in growth]{.mark} and
calcification [are **non-negative**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [implying the

ocean is also becoming more acidic because it's absorbing carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, posing a significant threat to oysters and other

concentrations have increased, but evidence discussed in [*Climate at a

[The]{.underline} realized [decline in pH attributable to ocean
acidification is about 0.1 unit]{.underline}, compared with the 0.3 to
0.4 units expected by the end of this century, when experimental
assessments indicate that ocean acidification is likely to reach levels
sufficient to significantly affect marine calcifiers (Doney et al.
2009). Moreover, there are significant uncertainties in the severity of
the decline of marine calcifiers due to ocean acidification even at the
end of the century, as [[ocean-acidification
experiments]{.underline}]{.mark} are considered to [[provide worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}, because a range of [mechanisms, including
**adaptation**, **evolution**, facilitative interactions in the
ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hendriks et al. 2010), [[and
physiological mechanisms]{.mark} to up-regulate pH]{.underline}
(McCulloch et al. 2012) [may **[buffer the impacts]{.mark}** and cause
differential responses among species]{.underline} (Pandolfi et al.
2011).

However, there have been a few claims for already realized impacts of
ocean acidification on calcifiers, such as a decline in the number of
oysters on the West Coast of North America (Barton et al. 2012) and in
Chesapeake Bay (Waldbusser et al. 2011). However, [the link between
these declines and ocean acidification through anthropogenic CO2 is
unclear]{.underline}. Corrosive waters affecting oysters in hatcheries
along the Oregon coast were associated with upwelling (Barton et al.
2012), not anthropogenic CO2. [The decline in pH]{.underline} affecting
oysters in Chesapeake Bay (Waldbusser et al. 2011) [was not attributable
to anthropogenic CO2]{.underline} but was likely attributable to excess
respiration associated with eutrophication. Therefore, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as yet, [[no]{.mark} robust [evidence
for]{.mark} realized [severe disruptions of marine socioecological links
from ocean acidification to anthropogenic CO2, and there are significant

Carlos Duarte, a marine biologist at the University of Western Australia
in Perth, and his colleagues say that gloomy media reports about ocean
issues such as invasive species and coral die-offs are not always based
on actual observations. It is not just journalists who are to blame,
they maintain: the marine research community "may not have remained
sufficiently sceptical" on the topic. "There are a lot of conversations
around meetings about the excess doom and gloom in our reporting of
ocean health, but perhaps this is the first paper to bring these
concerns out of the privacy of peer conversations," says Duarte. "This
is a silent movement, as there is a lot of peer pressure against voicing
those concerns openly, so my co-authors and I expect significant heat
upon us to be derived from our paper." In their review, published on 31
December in
*BioScience*[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16714#ref-CR1),
Duarte and his colleagues look at purported catastrophes, including
overfishing, jellyfish blooms, invasive species and the impact of ocean
acidification on organisms such as corals. In some cases, they say,
there is strong evidence for global-scale problems bringing severe
disruption --- overfishing is a prime example. But for other topics that
have excited scientific and media attention, the evidence is equivocal
or weak. In these categories, Duarte places global blooms of jellyfish
and the problems caused by invasive species. **Headline hype** Duarte\'s
team reviews a number of news reports and scientific papers. It
contrasts these with other papers that would seem to undermine the
catastrophe narrative. Among the \"excessive media headlines\" cited are
the CNN\'s \'[Overfished and under-protected: Oceans on the brink of
catastrophic
collapse](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/22/world/oceans-overfishing-climate-change/)\'.
Duarte also told *Nature* that its own news story \'[Coastal havoc
boosts jellies](https://doi.org/10.1038/514545a)\' fell into the \'doom
and gloom\' trap. Another example is the decline of species that build
calciferous shells, attributed to ocean acidification caused by carbon
dioxide dissolving in the seas. In 2013, [The Seattle
Times](http://apps.seattletimes.com/reports/sea-change/2013/sep/11/pacific-ocean-perilous-turn-overview/)
said that this issue \"is helping push the seas toward a great
unraveling that threatens to scramble marine life on a scale almost too
big to fathom\". But the authors of the *BioScience* paper say that
there are significant uncertainties in this. [[**Many** experiments are
based on "worst-case scenarios"]{.underline}]{.mark}, they say, and
claims that calciferous organisms are already declining [may relate not
to carbon emissions, but to other oceanic processes.]{.underline} And
although it is sometimes claimed that jellyfish blooms are increasing
around the world, Duarte\'s paper says there were no global attempts to
quantify the increase until 2012, [so [such claims are **extrapolated**
from a small number of cases. **Overselling such claims is
dangerous**]{.mark}]{.underline}, says the group, because the public may
become inured to them and give up trying to save an ocean that it
believes is already beyond redemption. Duarte is now looking to bring
together a group of like-minded researchers to 'audit' claims of ocean
disasters by critically assessing the evidence. This would [[weed out
claims based on poor evidence]{.mark}, he says, and bring society some
hope that [the oceans can be saved.]{.mark}]{.underline} As well as
pointing the finger at scientists and journalists, Duarte's group places
some of the blame for the hype at the door of some journals, including
*Nature*. "The appetite of the media for particular headlines can
influence the contents of top scientific journals," they write. (Note:
*Nature*'s news and comment team is editorially independent of its
research editorial team.) Philip Campbell, Nature\'s editor-in-chief,
disagrees. "We select research for publication in *Nature* on the basis
of scientific significance," he says. "That in turn may lead to citation
impact and media coverage, but *Nature* editors aren\'t driven by those
considerations, and couldn't predict them even if they wished to do so."
**Saving our seas?** "There are major problems facing the planet, and
that can't be overstated," says Benjamin Halpern, a marine researcher at
the University of California, Santa Barbara. "What can be overstated is
what's going to happen in the short term in a particular place. Their
broad point that some of this stuff is overstated is accurate --- to a
point," he says, noting that he has presented more-positive messages,
including in
*Nature*[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16714#ref-CR2).
Other researchers are even less sympathetic to Duarte\'s thesis. One is
atmospheric physicist Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography in La Jolla, California, whose work is criticized in the
paper. In 2010, Keeling and his co-authors suggested that in the future
the problem of low oxygen levels in water, now seen in \'dead zones\'
off many coasts, could spread on a global
scale[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16714#ref-CR3).
Duarte and his team do not present evidence to the contrary, but they
suggest that it is wrong to call this a \'calamity\'. But Keeling, who
leads programmes on atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen, says that his
paper did not use the term calamity. Instead, it called the issue "a
potentially serious consequence of global warming". Duarte\'s paper "is
kind of committing the same sin it's railing against in the casting of
this as a series of calamities", says Keeling. "The literature doesn't
call it calamites. That's their own hyperbolic language."

#### Ocean Acidification will lead to adaptation -- not extinction

Dallas, SD State, MIT, and Penn State. "Research Article Open Access
Adaptation or Extinction: Survival Strategies of Marine Organisms under
the Pressure of Climate Change" 04-16-24
<https://www.aquapublisher.com/index.php/ijms> - lily

3.1 Species migration and habitat selection

[In the context of coping with global climate change, marine organisms
maintain their survival and reproduction through a variety of adaptation
strategies]{.underline}, among which species migration and habitat
selection are one of their important means of adaptation. This is not
only a strategy for species to adapt to environmental changes, but also
reflects the complexity of interactions and dependencies between
ecosystems (Pandori and Sorte, 2019; Li et al., 2022).

Species migration refers to the movement of marine organisms to more
suitable areas in order to escape adverse environmental conditions, such
as excessively high water temperatures or unsuitable salinity. [As
global sea temperatures rise, many fish and marine mammals have begun
migrating to the polar regions or deeper waters in search of cooler
waters. For example, Atlantic cod, whose distribution range is moving
northward to adapt to colder water environments due to rising sea
temperatures.]{.underline}

Habitat selection involves marine organisms choosing the most suitable
location for survival based on changes in environmental conditions. This
includes not only physical conditions such as temperature and salinity,
but also ecological factors such as the availability of food resources,
the presence of predators, and conspecific competition. For example, sea
turtles choose to lay their eggs on warm beaches because the temperature
of the beach affects the sex ratio and hatching success of sea turtle
hatchlings. As global temperatures rise, some sea turtle populations are
beginning to seek sandy beaches farther north as nesting grounds in
search of more favorable temperature conditions.

[As sea levels rise and coastlines change, organisms in some coastal
habitats, such as mangroves and salt marshes, are also facing habitat
selection pressures. These biological populations need to adapt to
changes in their habitat sand find new suitable locations to maintain
their survival and reproduction.]{.underline}

3.2 Physiological adaptation mechanism

[The physiological adaptation mechanism is a series of internal
adjustments made by organisms to environmental changes, in order to
maintain the normal progress of their life activities and the survival
and reproduction of populations]{.underline}. These mechanisms cover
multi-level responses from molecules to cells, from organs to the entire
organism, enabling organisms to maintain the stability and adaptability
of their physiological functions in the face of environmental factors
such as temperature changes, water pressure, salinity changes, and
oxygen concentration changes.

In terms of temperature adaptation, [organisms adapt to different
temperature conditions by changing their metabolic rate, protein
expression, and the fluidity of their cell membranes. For example, polar
fish adapt to extremely low temperature environments.]{.underline} Many
fish living in Antarctic waters, such as Antarctic icefish, contain a
special antifreeze protein that prevents their body fluids from freezing
when they are below freezing. [Antifreeze proteins allow these fish to
survive in extremely cold waters without freezing to death by lowering
the freezing point of body fluids.]{.underline}

Water stress is another common environmental challenge, especially for
terrestrial plants and some terrestrial animals. Facing drought
conditions, plants adapt by closing stomata to reduce water evaporation,
increasing the water absorption capacity of roots, and accumulating
osmotic adjustment substances such as proline to maintain intracellular
water. [Animals may reduce water loss by changing behavioral patterns,
such as choosing a cool place to rest, or by physiological adjustments
such as increasing the kidney\'s ability to reabsorb water.]{.underline}

Eels display amazing physiological adaptability when it comes to
salinity regulation. Eels need to migrate between freshwater and
saltwater environments during their life cycle[. In order to adapt to
this environmental change, eels are able to adjust the osmotic pressure
in their bodies and maintain the balance of salt and water in their
bodies by changing the function of their kidneys and adjusting the
activity of ion transport proteins in their bodies.]{.underline}

[Changes in oxygen concentration also require organisms to have
corresponding physiological adaptation mechanisms]{.underline}. For
example, animals at high altitudes may have higher hemoglobin affinity
or more red blood cells to increase the efficiency of oxygen carrying
and utilization in low-oxygen environments[. Aquatic animals adapt to
water environments with lower oxygen content by improving their
respiratory organs, such as increasing the surface area of their
gills.]{.underline}

3.3 Adjustment of breeding strategies

Facing the challenges posed by climate change, [marine organisms adapt
to new environmental conditions by adjusting their reproductive
strategies to ensure that their offspring can survive in the changing
environment. These adjustments are manifested in reproductive time,
breeding location, and reproductive behavior, demonstrating the flexible
response of organisms to environmental changes during the evolution
process.]{.underline}

As global temperatures rise and seasonal rhythms in ecosystems change,
many marine birds adjust their breeding seasons to ensure that chicks
hatch during times when food resources are most abundant. For example,
black-footed albatrosses begin their breeding season earlier due to
rising ocean temperatures to adapt to changes in food availability.

[Another example is the Atlantic herring, a fish that has also shown
adaptation to environmental changes during reproduction. Research has
found that Atlantic herring adjust their spawning locations and depths
according to changes in ocean temperatures to find the most suitable
temperature conditions for the growth of young fish. This behavioral
adaptation strategy not only helps to improve reproductive success, but
also ensures that juvenile fish can obtain sufficient food resources
during the critical growth stage (Arevalo et al., 2021).]{.underline}

[Heart rate (HR) in mollusks is a fundamental physiological indicator
that reflects their health status and their ability to
adapt]{.underline} to different environmental conditions (Davis et al.,
2023; Fernández et al., 2024). This parameter responds to a variety of
stress factors, showing notable plasticity in populations inhabiting
variable environments. In the present study, Tagelus dombeii showed a
higher (but not significant) heart rate with lower food supply, would
indicate an increase in stress experienced by the organism (Davis et
al., 2023). Under extreme conditions, the relationship between HR and
metabolic rate may decouple (Marshall and McQuaid, 2020); mollusks can
maintain a constant HR while decreasing their metabolic rate, adopting
alternative strategies to ensure their survival (Marshall and McQuaid,
2020). Consistent with these findings, [our results show that T. dombeii
exhibited et. At.a reduced oxygen consumption rate under low pH
conditions, while heart rate increased when food supply was limited.
This suggests a decoupling between HR and metabolic rate, likely
reflecting an adaptive response to the combined stressors of ocean
acidification and food supply]{.underline}. Likewise, ocean
acidification can induce metabolic depression, evidenced by a reduction
in metabolism, which constitutes an energy-saving strategy against the
stress associated with low pH, regardless of changes in heart rate
(Martel et al., 2022).

[Our results indicate an effect of the interaction between pH and food
supply on oxygen consumption but not on food supply]{.underline}. This
finding could be explained by the ability of T. dombeii to employ both
types of feeding, which allows it to obtain nutrients from two different
sources, thus improving its efficiency in food acquisition (Navarro et
al., 2008). Although this study did not quantify the time spent on each
type of feeding, we suggest that [these organisms could alternate
between suspension feeding and deposit feeding to minimize the ingestion
of low-pH water under acidification conditions]{.underline} (see
Vlaminck et al., 2023). [This feeding flexibility allows infaunal
filter-feeding bivalves to mitigate the effects of acidification,
maintaining acid-base balance and avoiding physiological
alterations]{.underline} (see Vlaminck et al., 2023), which reinforces
the resilience and robustness of these organisms, in line with the
results obtained in M. calcarea (Goethel et al., 2017).

The variability in responses to adverse conditions of marine
invertebrates depends on the habitat of origin, the scales of
environmental variability, and the simultaneous presence of other stress
factors (Lefevre, 2016; Castillo et al., 2024; Gaitán-Espitia et al.,
2017). These elements influence the physiological responses of organisms
to cope with unfavorable conditions. In this study, the razor clams
analyzed come from Coihuín, a site near the Reloncaví fjord, which is
characterized by high variability in pCO2 and food supply (Vergara-Jara
et al., 2019; Lardies et al., 2001; Castillo et al., 2024). This
suggests that infaunal organisms in the tidal flat would show greater
signs of phenotypic plasticity, given the wide environmental variability
of this quasi-estuarine system (see Osores et al., 2017; Castillo et
al., 2024).

Global change, particularly ocean acidification, poses significant
threats to marine species and fisheries, including T dombeii. The
species metabolic depression in response to acidification could reduce
its harvestable biomass, thereby affecting the maximum sustainable yield
and threatening economic stability in affected regions. The previous
plus pressure of artisanal fisheries on T. dombeii, with an annual
harvest of 2,203 Mt (100 Mt from the Los Lagos Region), face potential
losses. For example, between 1996 and 2007, the selectivity for T.
dombeii dropped from a mean size of 76 mm to 54 mm (legal commercial
size 65 mm), indicating a shift toward smaller harvestable individuals
in the Bio-Bio region (Hernández et al., 2011). This trend could lead to
significant economic losses, underlining the need for adaptive fisheries
management that accounts for both climate stressors and ecological
dynamics.

[Tagelus dombeii demonstrates partial resilience to ocean acidification
due to its natural exposure to acidic pore water and flexible feeding
strategies. This adaptability allows it to optimize nutrient acquisition
and maintain physiological balance under stressful
conditions]{.underline}. However, its survival and performance are
compromised under low food supply, highlighting the importance of
trophic conditions. These findings highlight the complexity of infaunal
marine invertebrate responses to global change, emphasizing the need to
consider multiple stressors in future projections and fisheries.

[Marine species are]{.underline} facing growing challenges from ocean
acidification, and while some are struggling, others are [showing signs
of adaptation]{.underline}. Here are some ways that marine organisms are
adapting:

Behavioral changes: Some marine species alter their behaviors in
response to changing ocean conditions. For example, [fish may shift
their feeding habits or migration patterns to find more suitable
environments. Certain species might avoid areas with high acidity to
reduce exposure and stress.]{.underline}

Physiological adjustments: Marine organisms can sometimes adjust their
physiology to better cope with acidified conditions. For instance, [some
species are able to increase their internal production of bicarbonate to
counteract the effects of lower pH levels on their calcium carbonate
structures.]{.underline}

Evolutionary adaptation: Over longer periods of time, some marine
species may undergo evolutionary changes that enhance their resilience
to acidification. [Certain populations of marine organisms, like some
types of oysters, have shown resilience by developing genetic traits
that help them cope with acidified environments.]{.underline}

Symbiotic relationships: Coral reefs are particularly affected by ocean
acidification, but [some coral have adapted by forming new symbiotic
relationships with different types of algae that are more resilient to
acidic conditions. This helps coral maintain their health and function
despite changing environmental conditions.]{.underline}

Physiological tolerance: Certain marine species are exhibiting increased
tolerance to acidic conditions. For example, [some species of seaweed
and algae can continue to grow and thrive despite higher acidity levels,
which may help them outcompete less tolerant species and maintain
ecosystem functions.]{.underline}

Habitat shifts: Marine species may move to different habitats that are
less affected by acidification. For example, [species might migrate to
deeper or more alkaline waters where the impacts of acidification are
less severe]{.underline}.

[These adaptation strategies show how marine life can be
resilient]{.underline}, but they also reveal the limits of these
adaptations when faced with fast-changing environments.

The rate of [human-caused warming]{.underline} per decade has [increased
to nearly 0.27 degrees Celsius, painting \'a **depressing
picture\'**]{.underline}.

[[Humans]{.mark} are [on track]{.mark} to release so much greenhouse gas
in less than three years that a key **threshold** [for]{.mark} limiting
[global warming]{.mark} will [be nearly
**unavoidable**]{.mark},]{.underline} according to a study released
today.

The report predicts that [society will have emitted enough carbon
dioxide by early 2028 that **[crossing]{.mark}** an important [long-term
tempe]{.mark}rature **[boundary]{.mark}** will be **[more
likely]{.mark}** than not.]{.underline}

The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the
heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater
that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius of long-term
warming since preindustrial times.

[That level of gas accumulation,]{.underline} which comes from the
burning of fuels like gas, oil and coal, [is sooner]{.underline} than
the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last
year.

["[Things]{.mark} aren't just getting worse. They're **[getting worse
faster]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of
the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth.

["We're [actively moving in the **wrong direction**]{.mark} in a
critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious
climate goals. Some reports, there's a silver lining. I don't think
there really is one in this one."]{.underline}

Why is 1.5C so crucial?

That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris Agreement, has been a
cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change.

[Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heatwaves and
droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small
island nations.]{.underline}

Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct
correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide,
along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases
in global temperatures.

In Thursday\'s Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers
calculated that [society can spew only 143 billion more
tonnes]{.underline} (130 billion metric tonnes) [of carbon dioxide
before the **[1.5 limit becomes]{.mark}** technically
**[inevitable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The world is producing 46 billion tons]{.underline} (42 billion metric
tons) [a year]{.underline}, so that inevitability should hit around
February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this
year, the scientists wrote.

The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius of long-term warming
since preindustrial times, the report said.

Earth\'s energy imbalance

The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science
Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has
increased to nearly 0.27 degrees Celsius per decade, Hausfather said.

And the [[imbalance between]{.mark} the [heat]{.mark} Earth
[absorbs]{.mark} from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a
[key]{.mark} climate change [signal]{.mark}, is
accelerating,]{.underline} the report said.

"It\'s quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where [if you look
across the indicators]{.underline}, we find that [**[records]{.mark}**
are really being **[broken everywhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said lead
author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate
Futures at the University of Leeds in England.

"[**[I can\'t conceive of a situation where we]{.mark} can really [avoid
passing 1.5]{.mark}** degrees of very long-term temperature
change."]{.underline}

The increase in [emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main
driver]{.underline}. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot
and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect
that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes
in clouds also factor in.

That all shows up in Earth's energy imbalance, which is now 25 per cent
higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.

Earth's energy imbalance "is the most important measure of the amount of
heat being trapped in the system," Hausfather said.

[Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. "It is very
clearly accelerating. It's worrisome]{.underline}," he said.

Crossing the temperature limit

[The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year]{.underline}.
The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius of warming since preindustrial times
for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be
measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years.

Still, [the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few
years]{.underline} even if individual years haven\'t consistently hit
that mark, because of how the Earth\'s carbon cycle works.

That [[1.5 is "a clear limit,]{.mark} a political limit for which
countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change
[would be unacceptable to]{.mark} their
[societies]{.mark}]{.underline}," said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a
climate scientist at Imperial College London.

[The mark is so important]{.underline} because **[[once it is
crossed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, many [small island nations could
eventually disappear]{.underline} because of sea level rise, and
[scientific evidence shows that the **[impacts become]{.mark}**
particularly **[extreme]{.mark}** beyond that level, especially hurting
poor and vulnerable populations]{.underline}, he said.

First, the good news: [climate **[scientists]{.mark}**, as a whole, are
**[not warning us]{.mark} to prepare [for the
apocalyps]{.mark}e**.]{.underline} The most recent report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline})---[a
group of hundreds of scientists working with the United Nations to
analyze climate change research from around the
world]{.underline}---[names [many]{.mark} serious [risks brought]{.mark}
on [by]{.mark} the [warming]{.mark} of our planet, but **human
[extinction is not among them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1

"[If I had to rate odds, I would say the [**chances of**]{.mark} climate
change driving us to the point of human **[extinction]{.mark}** are very
low, if not **[zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}," says Adam Schlosser, the
Deputy Director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of
Global Change and a climate scientist who studies future climate change
and its impact on human societies.

In some ways, [the most [recent]{.mark} climate [science]{.mark} even
[shows]{.mark} some **[encouraging trends]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [IPCC
reports]{.underline} have always spelled out different scenarios for the
amount of climate-altering greenhouse gases humans will put into the
atmosphere, to show a range of possible climate risks the world may
face. The IPCC [calls these scenarios "representative concentration
pathways"]{.underline} (RCPs), and they [range from the relatively
mild]{.underline} RCP2.6 scenario all the way up to RCP8.5, whose risks
would be calamitous.

But as [the [world has made **progress**]{.mark} in recent years on
switching to **[clean energy]{.mark}** and controlling our greenhouse
gas emissions]{.underline}, [it has [become clearer]{.mark} that **[we
are not]{.mark}**, in fact, **[headed toward]{.mark}** the **[worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}**.]{.underline} "[RCP8.5 is being viewed more and more
as an extreme outcome]{.underline}," says Schlosser. [Even with no
further progress]{.underline} on climate action, he says, the less-dire
RCP6.0 scenario now looks closest to reality.

On the other hand, RCP6.0 would still be catastrophic to many people in
many places. In fact, the latest IPCC report estimates that many climate
risks are more serious than previously believed, even in the best case
scenarios, based in part on the damage caused by the increased storms,
heatwaves and droughts we've already seen.2

"[Human [extinction is not really the main worry]{.mark}]{.underline},"
says Schlosser. "There are going to be some really, really bad regional
and local consequences. Consider island nations of the world---the type
of warming that we\'re heading toward, with the expected sea level rise
that could force them in many places to retreat or possibly abandon
their homeland, is an existential threat to them."

For many people, asking if climate change is the "end of the world" may
be a way of asking if it's the end of their world---if they should be
taking steps to cope with widespread breakdowns in infrastructure or
public services or the food supply. "And it depends upon where you
live," says Schlosser. "I would give a very different answer if you were
living in the Northeast United States as opposed to an island nation or
the coastal plains of Bangladesh or in the middle of the Sahel."

In part, this is due to unequal climate impacts: low-lying coastal areas
facing two or three feet of sea level rise will suffer greatly whether
they're wealthy Miami or impoverished Kiribati. But there is also a
basic injustice at work. Wealthier countries and regions have the most
resources to prepare for, soften and recover from climate impacts. This
means they're more able to bounce back after a disaster strikes.

"The most vulnerable populations are the poorest populations," says
Schlosser. "If we do nothing about climate change, conditions are going
to get worse for people who are poor and don\'t have the means to cope
with it."

Over the past hundred years, the world has made enormous progress in
reducing extreme poverty.3 But climate change threatens to halt or
reverse those gains in many regions, says Schlosser, by reducing crop
yields and forcing low-income countries to channel ever more of their
limited wealth into withstanding extreme weather. "They\'re going to
spend more and more of their resources to adapt to an ever-changing
climate. And those resources that they could have used for recreation,
welfare, livelihoods, won\'t be there."

To rob these people---who have done the least to contribute to climate
change---of rising standards of living would be a mass tragedy, made no
less painful by the fact that human civilization would carry on in some
form.

"[If I had to rank climate change as an existential risk to humanity, it
would be below a lot of the other threats that are heavy on people\'s
minds]{.underline}," says Schlosser. "[**[Nuclear war, global
pandemics]{.mark}**: as an existential risk these [are **far
greater**]{.mark} than climate change]{.underline}."

"But I understand why people are using that language," he adds, "because
they want people to pay attention. The worry is that it is a little
distorted. I would find it a tragedy, personally, if we had to show that
human existence would be wiped away for us to do anything about
human-caused climate change. This is about recognizing that there is a
massive disruption coming to our way of life, and a potentially
existential disruption to the way of life of many people around the
world who have very little control over future climate change."

also [major world leaders]{.underline}---including the U.S. Secretary of
Defense, major American presidential candidates, and the United Nations
secretary general---have [[labeled climate]{.mark} [change an
**"existential threat."**]{.mark}]{.underline} But what does an
"existential threat" really mean, and why are so many people in
positions of responsibility now echoing this phrase?

Kieran Setiya, an MIT professor of philosophy who co-teaches a course on
the ethics of climate change, offers a basic and a more nuanced
definition. First: In the worst-case scenarios in scientists' climate
models, human-caused climate change is a threat to the continued
existence of many species and to human society as we know it. If humans
do nothing to slow climate change, then global temperatures may increase
by 4.5 degrees Celsius or more by the year 2100.1 This may not sound
like much, Setiya says, but "it is quite cataclysmic." Earth has not
been that warm in millions of years, and such temperature spikes in our
planet's history are connected to mass extinction events that killed off
a large percentage of species that existed at the time.2

That more literal-minded reading of the phrase ["[existential]{.mark}
threat" [may **not be the best reflection**]{.mark} of the risks of
climate change,]{.underline} however. ["[Even **under**]{.mark} our
**[most dire predictions]{.mark}**, human [**society** is **still
around**]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Adam Schlosser, the Deputy Director
of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change and
a climate scientist who studies future climate change and its impact on
human societies. "[[I do]{.mark} [not]{.mark} personally [view this as
an extinction issue]{.mark}.]{.underline} But there are going to be
unavoidable consequences, and disasters especially for coastal
communities, coastal cities, and island nations."

Which brings us to Setiya's second definition of an "existential
threat." [[Even if humanity]{.mark} does [reduce]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark} enough to stave off the worst effects of climate
change---and learn to adapt to some [warming]{.mark} that is **[already
inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}---Setiya says that climate change
still threatens to eradicate a host of human cultures, traditions, and
languages. One example he gives is the Inuit peoples who are indigenous
to Arctic regions, and whose cold-weather culture is under threat as the
amount of ice in polar regions continues to decline. Residents of
low-lying islands face an immediate, existential threat to their
cultures as rising sea levels could submerge their homelands.

#### There is limited impact to climate tipping points 

Jakob **Deutloff, 25** -- Jakob Deutloff is a researcher from the Global
Systems Institute at the University of Exeter (UK), the Center for Earth
System Research and Sustainability (CEN) at the University of Hamburg,
and the International Max Planck Research School on Earth System
Modelling (IMPRS-ESM) in Hamburg. \"High probability of triggering
climate tipping points under current policies modestly amplified by
Amazon dieback and permafrost thaw\" 4-1-2025
https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/16/565/2025/ - lily

We investigate [the probabilities of triggering climate tipping points
under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways]{.underline} (SSPs) and how
[they are altered by including the additional carbon emissions that
could arise from tipping points within the Earth\'s carbon
cycle.]{.underline} The crossing of a climate tipping point at a
threshold level of global mean surface temperature (threshold
temperature) would commit the affected subsystem of the Earth to abrupt
and largely irreversible changes with negative impacts on human
well-being. However, it remains unclear which tipping points would be
triggered under the different SSPs due to uncertainties in the climate
sensitivity to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the threshold
temperatures and timescales of climate tipping points, and the response
of tipping points within the Earth\'s carbon cycle to global warming. We
include those uncertainties in our analysis to derive probabilities of
triggering for 16 previously identified climate tipping points within
the Earth system. To conduct our analysis, we use the reduced complexity
climate model FaIR (Finite amplitude Impulse Response) which is coupled
to a conceptual model of the tipping processes within the Amazon
rainforest and permafrost, which are the two major tipping points within
the Earth\'s carbon cycle. Uncertainties are propagated by employing a
Monte Carlo approach for the construction of large model ensembles. [We
find that carbon tipping points increase the risk for high-temperature
pathways, but on average their warming effect remains small, with its
median staying 1 order of magnitude lower than the median anthropogenic
warming for all SSPs. Therefore, they have low potential to increase the
probability of triggering other tipping points. The maximum triggering
probability increase from carbon tipping points among all SSPs occurs
under SSP2-4.5, with a 3 percentage point increase averaged over all
tipping points]{.underline}. The warming trajectory expected from
current policies compares best to SSP2-4.5, which we find to be unsafe
with regard to triggering climate tipping points. Our most conservative
estimate of triggering probabilities averaged over all tipping points is
62 % under SSP2-4.5, and nine tipping points have a more than 50 %
probability of getting triggered. [Under SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9, the risk
of triggering climate tipping points is reduced significantly compared
to SSP2-4.5; however, it also remains less constrained since the
behaviour of climate tipping points in the case of a temperature
overshoot is still highly uncertain.]{.underline}

[In many ways, the term "tipping point" in climate science was
predisposed to be misunderstood. Both components of the term invite
confusion.]{.underline}

First, the word "tipping" implies the rapidity of an unbalanced cart
toppling over. Yet [in practice, many climate science papers and reports
suggest that rapid changes of state for tipping
elements]{.underline}---say, systematic shifts that take just 20 years
or less---[are rare enough to be the exception, not the
rule]{.underline}. Components of the climate system are sluggish on
human time scales, and thus many Earth system components change over the
course of decades, if not centuries or millennia. [For example, future
carbon release **from thawing permafrost** and sea-level rise from loss
of the Greenland ice sheet **will take place over several hundred
years.**]{.underline}

[To an earth scientist]{.underline} thinking on geologic timescales,
[that does seem like a very rapid transition]{.underline} relative to
the glacial pace at which the Earth system typically changed prior to
the industrial revolution. [To a layperson]{.underline} who thinks about
a stacked pile of blocks or the leaning tower of Pisa tipping over,
however, [rapid means something different]{.underline}. [This
discrepancy in perspectives leads to differing expectations for how
climate tipping elements behave and how quickly or slowly their impacts
unfold.]{.underline}

Second, the word "[point]{.underline}," too, is bound to confuse. It
[implies a single, precise, known critical threshold beyond which Earth
system components tip.]{.underline}

In some cases---and depending on the boundaries one defines for a
climate system---that system may indeed behave nonlinearly after
crossing an exact threshold. This is the case for a system such as the
Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, a large ice sheet the size of Florida,
widely understood to be at risk of irreversible loss of mass over the
course of centuries should warming push the ice sheet across a
structural tipping point.

[However, critical thresholds are rarely precisely known. And large
continental-scale systems like Arctic permafrost landscapes or the
Amazon rainforest may not possess a single overall climate tipping
point, but may instead exhibit nonlinear state shifts at smaller scales
in response to crossing regional and local thresholds]{.underline}.
Rainforests degrade acre by acre, while permafrost on sunny south-facing
hillsides may thaw and release carbon sooner.

If "tipping points" is such an imperfect phrase, though, how did the
term become so widespread in popular discourse?

As is the case for many scientific concepts, the terminology of climate
tipping points originated as a theory, which researchers have
subsequently developed and explored to far greater depth. While the
first colloquial occurrences of the term "tipping point" in English
writing date back to around the 19th century, social and political
scientists began using a tipping point framework to describe political
movements and rapid socioeconomic shifts in the decades following World
War II.

Following the journalist Malcolm Gladwell's popularization of the term
with his book "The Tipping Point" in the early 2000s, Earth science
subsequently imported the term to help articulate the idea of Earth
system components that might undergo state shifts---fast or slow---at
critical thresholds. Some of the early scientific discussions revolved
around a potential global-scale tipping point, and others referred
imprecisely to as "tipping points." Gradually, most scientists settled
upon the term "tipping elements," defined as "a critical threshold
beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly,"
as the latest IPCC report puts it.

But even now, [there is wide variation in the extent to which the term
"tipping points" is used in scientific literature to refer to a fast
process, or a slow one, and whether it's a general conceptual framework
or something that can be defined mathematically or
statistically.]{.underline}

On top of this, candidate members of the tipping elements club have
shifted as scientific understanding of different Earth system components
has progressed. For instance, some researchers once proposed the
possibility of abrupt future decline in Arctic summertime sea ice, but
this hypothesis has faded, with subsequent research reinforcing the
conclusion that Arctic summer sea ice declines steadily in proportion to
increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, theories that projected
substantial abrupt state shifts in monsoon circulation or the El Niño
cycle have largely been laid to rest. Papers from a decade ago raised
alarm at the possibility that huge amounts of methane could bubble out
of the ocean with apocalyptic consequences. But [we now understand that
frozen methane buried deep in seafloor sediments responds only slowly
and gradually to warming, releasing a trickle of atmosphere-warming
methane over centuries and millennia]{.underline}.

And so, as of this writing, Arctic summer sea ice, regional monsoons,
seafloor methane hydrates, and El Niño have mostly been stricken from
lists of tipping elements. In some cases, new proposed tipping elements
have replaced them. A fall 2022 paper in Science, for instance, has
added "collapse of the Labrador Sea subpolar ocean gyre" and "abrupt
loss of Barents Sea sea-ice" as new possible tipping elements. With
time, further research may validate---or eliminate---these new
prospective entrants as well.

All of this illustrates how the current understanding of climate tipping
elements remains uncertain. Climate skeptics might seize upon such
uncertainty to question climate change itself. But make no mistake---the
uncertainty of tipping elements revolves around the degree of future
impacts. [That climate change is affecting these systems is not remotely
in question. At the same time, our projections for future climate are
unmistakably less certain than we might like. The best scientific
efforts and latest research typically yield a range of potential
answers---zones of risk within which critical thresholds may
lie.]{.underline}

Given such grim ambiguity, [media headlines often seize on the
worst-case, high-end impacts as the likeliest outcome. For instance,
science headlines have popularly termed greenhouse gases released from
thawed Arctic soils as a "carbon bomb," even as permafrost experts
wearily stress that overall carbon release will be gradual. Writers and
reporters have likewise described the threat of seafloor methane
bubbling out of the oceans as a "bomb" or "gun," selectively invoking a
diminishing number of studies advancing an increasingly discredited
hypothesis of abrupt and dangerous ocean methane release.]{.underline}

But [if the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has such
cutting-edge,]{.underline} best-in-class [[military equipment]{.mark},
why has it [struggled to win wars]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent
decades? Why are so many of these conflicts---most notably Iraq,
Afghanistan, or even the recent U.S. campaign against the Houthis---a
study in frustration and failure? [The answer is that **[airpower has
limits]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which President Donald Trump may soon
discover.

Why Decisive Wins Have Been Out of Reach

Army and Marine officers love to cite a quote from historian T.R.
Fehrenbach's classic history of the Korean War: "Americans in 1950
rediscovered something that since Hiroshima they had forgotten: you may
fly over a land forever; you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and
wipe it clean of life---but if you desire to defend it, protect it, and
keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, the way the
Roman legions did, by putting your young men into the mud."

[**[Despite]{.mark}** the impressive **[advances]{.mark}** in airpower
since the 1950s]{.underline}---and the advent of the kind of
precision-guided munitions employed in Saturday's strike---Fehrenbach's
words are as relevant as ever and explains why it is difficult to win a
war decisively. In most cases, [military victories require occupying
enemy territory]{.underline} and some form of state building. This
process automatically [exposes ground troops to risk far beyond any
encountered by advanced aircraft operating over countries]{.underline}
that either lack advanced air defenses or have had their air advances
neutralized in advance (as the Israelis did in Iran).

In [Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}, which [involved extensive air
strikes]{.underline} and an eventual ground force occupation, [U.S.
troops found themselves in a grinding guerrilla war against brutal but
low-tech foes]{.underline}. And now [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark},
[despite]{.underline} its ability to mount [[impressive
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} against a country located a thousand miles
away, [is [still struggling to pacify the Gaza
Strip]{.mark}]{.underline} next door 20 months after the Oct. 7, 2023,
Hamas attack that sparked the current regional conflict. Although the
Israeli Defense Forces have inflicted substantial damage on Hamas---in
the process killing large numbers of Palestinian civilians and razing
their homes---they have not been able to end the war, because they are
afraid that as soon as Israeli troops leave, the terrorist group will
spring back up out of the rubble.

Iran's Waiting Game

What will happen now in Iran is anyone's guess, but there is little
likelihood of Iran signing an "unconditional surrender"---as demanded
last week by Trump---and bringing this conflict to a swift conclusion.
More likely, Iran will try to wait out Israel and the United States,
while striking back in some manner to save face after this humiliating
setback.

If Iran does retaliate, the United States may launch more air strikes
and possibly escalate the conflict further. But there is little chance
of either Israel or the United States sending ground troops to invade
Iran because of the risk of another quagmire in a nation that has twice
the population of Iraq, or more than 90 million people.

Many in Israel and the United States hope that the air strikes will
prompt Iran's people to rise up against their government, but this is
unlikely. The history of air strikes, going back to the days of the
London Blitz in 1940, is that civilians under assault from the skies
rally around their leaders rather than rebel against them. Governments
usually get overthrown---think of Argentina after the 1982 Falkland
Islands War or Serbia after the 1999 Kosovo War---only after losing wars
that involved both air and ground operations.

The Nuclear Deterrence Challenge

The [[best-case scenario]{.mark} for the **[air strikes]{.mark}** is
that they will **[set back]{.mark}** the [**Iranian** nuclear
program]{.mark} for several years]{.underline}, but [even **[this is
uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Trump has insisted that the
nuclear facilities targeted by the United States have been "completely
obliterated," Israeli officials told the New York Times that the
underground complex in Fordow had been damaged but not destroyed and
that the Iranians had moved nuclear material out of the site before the
U.S. attack. Moreover, CNN reported that the tunnels beneath the Isfahan
complex, where some of Iran's highly enriched uranium was stored, were
not touched by the air strikes. Administration officials have also
admitted they are not sure what happened to the 900 pounds of near
weapons-grade uranium that Iran had built up before Israel\'s campaign.

Whatever the damage to Iran's existing nuclear program, Iran retains the
knowledge necessary to restart operations and may now be tempted to push
toward a bomb to deter further attacks. Unless Iran reaches an
international agreement to stop all nuclear activities---which seems
unlikely at this juncture---Israel and the United States may wind up
deciding to strike again at some point in the future.

[This shows the limits of airpower, **even when** it is being **employed
by the United States**,]{.underline} with its vaunted capabilities,
precision, and reach. While [U.S. [**airstrikes** can **cause**]{.mark}
tremendous **[damage]{.mark}**, they **[cannot overthrow a
government]{.mark}** or bend it to America's will. In other words,
**[airpower cannot end a threat]{.mark}**---it can **[only degrade or
contain it.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The Modern-Day Air Force

Fast forward to [2025]{.underline}. [Today, [the U.S. Air Force
inventory is the **smallest** in]{.mark} the service's
**[78-year]{.mark} history**.]{.underline} As reported by the Air Force
Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin at the AFA Warfare Symposium in
March, [the [average age]{.mark} of all USAF aircraft [is]{.mark} now
**[over 31]{.mark} years old**.]{.underline} Gen. Allvin told Airmen at
the symposium that [[readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}, as measured by
aircraft availability rates, [[is]{.mark} now **[54 percent]{.mark} on
average** for all Air Force aircraft]{.underline}, [meaning just over
**five out of every 10 aircraft** are **ready to fly** on a given day
because of [**funding** and **parts shortfalls**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If called to fight tonight, the Air Force could generate just 56
combat-coded F-22s for air superiority and 354 combat-coded
F-15Es, F-16s, and F-35s for strike and interdiction. 

[The [bomber fleet is]{.mark} similarly
**[diminished]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Its 140 total
aircraft---B-52s, B-1s, and B-2s spread across nine squadrons---average
48 years old. Only 19 are stealthy B-2s, and even those average 31 years
of age. [Just [**52** percent]{.mark} of the bomber fleet [is
mission-capable]{.mark} on any given day.]{.underline} 

The ARC combined have 640 fighters; subtracting training and test jets,
that leaves 434 fighters in operational units. Subtracting further due
to mission capability rates, the ARC can muster just 66 air superiority
fighters and 155 strike and interdiction fighters against China on any
given day. 

The Air Force has roughly 272 known air-breathing ISR aircraft that
include 22 RC-135, 9 RQ-4 Global Hawks, 27 U-2s, an estimated  20 to 30
RQ-170 Sentinels, and 184 MQ-9 Reapers for armed ISR. While the
different aircraft all have unique attributes, the MQ-9 demonstrates the
broadening of the mission area, providing a unique sensor-shooter
capability that did not exist in the Cold War. While space plays an
increasing role in ISR, airborne assets remain essential to modern
combat. Factoring in readiness, the Total Force could deploy only 523
fighters and 51 bombers into the Indo-Pacific today if war broke out,
and just 308 of those fighters and 27 of the bombers would be mission
ready upon landing in theater. While the macro ISR number has held
steady since the Cold War, [[**demand signals**]{.mark} from combatant
commands continue to **increase**, which **risks [stretch]{.mark}ing
[the force too thin]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Combat **losses**,
inevitable against a peer threat, would **reduce those numbers
further**.]{.underline} 

This significantly reduced combat force structure compared to the Cold
War era comes just as China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF)
is growing. Over the past 14 years, China fielded some 1,300
combat-coded fighters, including 320 fifth-generation J-20s. Another 120
J-20s alone come hot off production lines annually, more than double the
number of new combat jets the U.S. Air Force is buying. China's 185 H-6
bombers, less advanced some than U.S. bombers, provide significant
regional strike capability, and China's industrial base, unencumbered by
budget constraints, delivers the PLAAF a numerical edge, and a superior
ability to backfill attrition. 

The Roots of Decline

[[The Air Force's current]{.mark} force structure and **readiness
[crisis]{.mark}** [stems from **decades** of **underfunding**
and]{.mark} **strategic [miscalculations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [To pay
for a post-Cold War "peace dividend," the Pentagon and Congress
**slashed Air Force procurement funding by 52 percent** between 1989 and
2001]{.underline}---cutting USAF buys deeper than either Army or Navy
procurement. The Air Force adopted a "divest to invest" strategy,
intended to retire legacy aircraft to fund modernization. In actuality,
it became a [**divest-only policy**.]{.underline} [The Air Force retired
33 B-1s in 2003 and 250 fighters in 2009; it acquired no new bombers and
only 120 fighters over that same six-year period.]{.underline} 

High operational tempos during the Global War or Terrorism elevated
demand for USAF fighters, bombers, and ISR aircraft over those same
years, with every weapon system in the USAF inventory flying thousands
of hours in low-threat environments. But instead of convincing lawmakers
to buy more combat aircraft, those actions only further eroded the
service life of Air Force combat aircraft. The one exception to this was
ISR: The Air Force acquired large numbers of MQ-1 Predators and MQ-9
Reapers, yet demand for their services soared and supply was never
sufficient.

[[Modernization]{.mark} in the rest of the Air Force
**[lagged]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [F-22 production, initially planned
for **750** jets, was **cut short at 187**.]{.underline} The Air Force
envisioned 800 F-35s by 2020, but instead acquired only 272. Instead of
dominating the Air Force inventory, stealthy [fifth-generation [aircraft
that can penetrate **China's**]{.mark} layered air [defenses make
up]{.mark} just **[28 percent]{.mark} of U.S. fighters**.]{.underline}
[[Fourth-gen]{.mark}eration [fighters]{.mark} like the F-16 and
F-15,]{.underline} while still capable, [**[lack]{.mark}** the
[**stealth** and **sensor fusion**]{.mark} needed to survive those
defenses, which include Russian S-400 air defenses.]{.underline}
Curtailed production buys were not restricted to fighters. Funding was
slashed for the B-2, with just 21 of the stealth bombers purchased
versus the 120 stipulated in the original requirement. On top of all
this, slow weapons procurement means a single week of sustained combat
against China could deplete the U.S. inventory of long-range munitions,
such as the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).

Yet [the [**worst indicator** of Air Force health is **pilot
readiness**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For more than 12 years, [the Air Force
[has **not funded**]{.mark} the [flying **hours** or **sortie
rates**]{.mark}, [nor]{.mark} the **[spare parts]{.mark}** required to
sustain all mission ready aircrew training requirements.]{.underline}
[Over the past seven years, fighter pilots have averaged **two or
fewer** sorties a week]{.underline}---[**below the minimum sortie
requirement** for any pilot or squadron to be considered **combat
mission ready**.]{.underline} Pilots are flying at basic mission capable
rates, which is below what is needed to form the habit patterns and
develop the judgment that comes with frequent reps of individual combat
tasks and regular large force employment training. [[**At best**, U.S.
front-line fighter pilots]{.mark}---and therefore every combat fighter
squadron in the Air Force---[are qualified to conduct only **limited
wartime missions**.]{.mark}]{.underline} 

[U.S. **bomber** crews are in even **worse shape**.]{.underline}
[**Years of underfunding** flying-hour programs and **weapons system
sustainment** accounts make it **unlikely** that a single bomber
squadron can execute peer-level mission requirements within their
respective designed operational capability  statements.]{.underline}
[Employing forces that are **not trained** for a high-end fight would
undoubtedly suffer **higher loss rates**, not just in combat, but during
the more benign phases of flight, like taking off and
landing.]{.underline} Recent accident reports, like one that followed
the January 2024 crash of a B-1, confirm this. That \$300 million bomber
was lost during a routine instrument approach into its home field. The
mishap pilot had three sorties in the previous month, and the instructor
pilot had just two in the previous 60 days.

#### [Alt causes]{.underline} mean that [deterrence]{.underline} is [cooked]{.underline}.

Too often, military equipment platforms are seen in overly simplistic
terms. They might be viewed unfavorably as little more than a boon for
contractors, or as a scapegoat that must be killed in the name
of better, faster, and cheaper technology. However, this same equipment
is the backbone of our military's capability. It gives us the capacity
to deter our adversaries and wage war if necessary. A man without a
machine in the U.S. military is limited in training and skill, and
eventually there is a cost to our global presence. [[When]{.mark} the
capital [assets]{.mark} that power our armed forces [**age
out** and **retire**]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} recapitalization and [replacements **stall**,]{.mark}
[capability **gaps grow**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This leads to
[worsening manpower **shortages**]{.mark} and eventually **retention
challenges**, not to mention **[failures of
deterrence]{.mark}**. ]{.underline}

[Nowhere is this issue **more acute** than in the **U.S. Air
Force**.]{.underline} [The [**aging** out of
**equipment**]{.mark} without ready replacements [is worsening the Air
Force's **pilot shortage**]{.mark}, which was dubbed a
**[crisis]{.mark}** just a few years ago.]{.underline} The trainer jets
used to qualify new pilots are so decrepit that the timeline it takes to
create a pilot has elongated from 24 months to nearly four years. 

After being commissioned as an officer in the Air Force, a future pilot
now typically waits for two years just to begin pilot training. Another
two years are needed on average to create a highly skilled pilot,
depending on the type of aircraft. These [lengthy **[delays]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} the **[uncertainty]{.mark}** that comes with them, [are
causing the Air Force to **shed pilots**]{.mark}.]{.underline} If a
young person joined the Air Force to fly planes, and there are not even
enough planes to train on, they will leave and fly instead for private
airlines. That is exactly what 3,280 of them did just last year. 

So is it the chicken or the egg? Not enough pilots or not enough
aircraft? In this case, it seems [the [**lack of aircraft** is
contributing]{.mark} to and compounding the existing problem of not
enough pilots. ]{.underline}

[The problem goes beyond a dearth of aircraft and pilots.]{.underline}
[[The Air Force's]{.mark} national **air-crew [crisis]{.mark}**[ has
been **brewing** for years]{.mark},]{.underline} [as the Force has been
[short thousands of **maintainers**]{.mark} for the past
decade.]{.underline} [Every missing maintainer creates **more strain**
for the ones that remain, which creates a [compounding **negative
effect** on force retention]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

As the services struggle to bring in fresh talent, [those who are
already in uniform are assigned the **extra tasks** that the new
recruits would have picked up.]{.underline} [The result is **undermanned
units that are overworked**.]{.underline} Eventually, the [[overburdened
troops decide they **cannot do more** with less and **bolt for the
exits**.]{.underline}]{.mark} 

As the pilot corps shrinks and the number of flyable planes drops,
flying hours similarly have fallen. [The last two decades have seen a
[**steady decline** of over 1 million funded **flying hours**]{.mark}
per year in the Air Force,]{.underline} ["[offering pilots **fewer
opportunities**]{.mark} to contribute and **keep their skills
current**." ]{.underline}

[[Antique aircraft are **less reliable** and take **longer to
repair**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Planes in the shop mean there is no iron
on the ramp. 

[Fewer flying hours also make airmen **less safe** and **more prone to
costly accidents**.]{.underline} Further[, maintainers and pilots who
are idle for a period of time can **lose their qualifications** and have
to start over once planes become available.]{.underline}

If you're keeping count, [[that's **three different crises** affecting
**manpower**, **machinery**, and **maintenance**]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- [[each **exacerbating the effects of the
others**]{.mark}.]{.underline} These crises didn't crop up overnight. In
the words of one former fighter pilot, the past is prologue. 

"In the 1990s, \[the US Air Force\] divested too many aircraft, they
closed down too many pilot training bases. They simply don't have the
capacity to produce the number of pilots that they need, and they don't
have the aircraft required to absorb the pilots they do
create," according to Heather Penney at the Air Force Association.

Despite what leaders say, the Air Force needs airplanes. In this
year's budget request, President Joe [[Biden]{.mark} requested just
**72** fighter aircraft --- while **divesting 89** --- and **zero new**
trainer aircraft.]{.underline} [This only **[exacerbates the]{.mark}
airframe [shortage]{.mark}**, which **[worsens]{.mark}** the pilot and
maintainer [**deficiencies** and **cuts down on global
engagements**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

The Air Force's former fighter presence in Japan shows this doom loop at
work. Seven months have passed since the Air Force decided to withdraw
its once permanently-stationed F-15C/D fighters from Kadena Air Force
Base in Okinawa. The Air Force still lacks a firm plan for what comes
next, likely because they don't have enough airplanes to go around to
meet the demands of global presence and deterrence. 

As the prime minister of Latvia told Politico this week,
"[[**deterrence** has to be **credible**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[And
credible means **actual forces**]{.mark}, **actual capabilities**."
[Getting smaller should not be the preferred way]{.mark} to pay for
future technologies]{.underline} when bolstering global deterrence is
the urgent work of now.

Primacy and the Goldilocks Problem

A broad range of research in international relations suggests that,
under most circumstances, [great power politics in [Asia is **likely to
be peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Defensive realists have long argued
that [[the costs of conquests are **extraordinarily
high**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [their theories are especially relevant in
**Asia**]{.underline}, [where [**maritime geography** and]{.mark} the

**large defensive advantage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.21 Liberal arguments
often come to the same conclusion by a different route: [**[economic

[creating]{.mark} the capitalist
**[interdependence]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.mark} is often said
to **[incentivize peace]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [Modern economies have

[One could further add **cognitive**, **normative**, and **biological

are **moving away** from warfare for all those reasons]{.underline},
while John Mueller has contended that [major war among modern,

liberal causes of peace---widespread democracy and dense
institutionalization---has become a less compelling worry. Although
[Asia]{.underline} lacks the institutionalization of European politics,
it [is not exactly **devoid** of [institutions]{.mark}, which [have

#### No Asia conflict over oil and the US won't fight

Wesley **Rahn 17**, journalist for DW, citing an energy analyst at the
Center for Security and International Studies, "Will the US fight for
oil in the South China Sea?" 2/22/17,
http://www.dw.com/en/will-the-us-fight-for-oil-in-the-south-china-sea/a-37677319

Despite potential on paper and a lot of estimation, there hasn\'t been a
major amount of hydrocarbons extracted from the SCS, as a combination of
political conflict, geology, and poor infrastructure have held back
development. And according to USGS estimates, most of the hydrocarbon
resources in the SCS consist of natural gas. Edward Chow, an energy
analyst at the Center for Security and International Studies (CSIS),
told DW that [[disputed areas in the SCS were not of]{.mark} major
[interest to]{.mark} international [oil companies]{.mark}. \"[There
is]{.mark} a lot of [popular misunderstanding of the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea dispute, fanned by [politicians]{.mark} who
[sensationalize the issue]{.mark}]{.underline},\" said Chow. Mikkal E.
Herberg, Research Director of the Energy Security Program at the
National Bureau of Asian Research (NBR), wrote in a 2016 report that the
energy resources in the SCS were overestimated. \"[[Despite]{.mark}
journalistic [hyperbole]{.mark}]{.underline} [about the petroleum riches
of the South China Sea, the reality is that most Western
[estimates]{.mark} of the region\'s oil and gas resource potential
[suggest]{.mark} relatively [modest resources]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
said Herberg in the report, adding that the amount wasn\'t large enough
to alter Asia\'s \"deep dependence on oil and gas imported from outside
the region.\" No need for conflict In 2014, to the east of ExxonMobil\'s
blocks, the CNOOC moved an oil rig called the Hai Duong 981 into
contested waters near the Paracel Islands. The move sparked a diplomatic
row with Vietnam that escalated to small conflicts with fishing boats.
Since then, the issue has been a constant source of irritation between
the two nations. [But [despite]{.mark} these [isolated
incidents]{.mark}, experts estimate that most of the
[hydrocarbons]{.mark} found [in the SCS]{.mark} [are outside of disputed
territory]{.mark} [and]{.mark} therefore [would not be a factor
in]{.mark} international [conflict]{.mark} over resources.]{.underline}
However, the contest is not about who gets to extract the oil and gas
found under the surface of SCS, but rather who controls the sea lanes
traversing the region, say observers. According to the US Department of
Energy, a third of total global crude oil trade and half of liquid
natural gas (LNG) passes through the SCS. [\"From my point of view as an
international energy expert, [the dispute has little to do with oil and
gas]{.mark} and a lot [more]{.mark} to do [with sovereignty]{.mark}, sea
lanes of communication, [even fisheries]{.mark} than with energy,\" said
Chow.]{.underline} Against this backdrop, the SCS doesn\'t seem fit for
the title of a \"second Persian Gulf\" with regard to energy resources,
as [some Chinese media have referred to it. [Even if US]{.mark} foreign
[policy]{.mark} in the SCS [grows more assertive]{.mark} under Secretary
Tillerson, [it is]{.mark} most [likely to be based on]{.mark} creating
[a defensive posture]{.mark} [regarding trade]{.mark} routes
[and]{.mark} affirming [alliances]{.mark} than expanding on energy
interests. \"[The US]{.mark} government generally [seeks to
promote]{.mark} the [business interests]{.mark} of American companies,
but again the [disputed areas have]{.mark} attracted very [little
exploration interest]{.mark},\" said Chow.]{.underline}

In April, China conducted two days of war games to practice various
military maneuvers around Taiwan. The Chinese Communist Party has
repeatedly warned Taipei against seeking full independence from China.

The Times reports that in 2021, China "held a single brigade exercise
near Taiwan and followed it with a six-brigade drill in 2022 and a
42-brigade exercise in 2024."

[While China has **increased** military **drills** and warnings to
Taiwan, Heritage Foundation China research fellow]{.underline} Michael
Cunningham [argues that war between China and Taiwan is **very
unlikely.**]{.underline}

["No, **[China won't invade Taiwan]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Cunningham
told The Daily Signal.

["The **[prospect of war]{.mark}** over Taiwan is **even [scarier for
Beijing]{.mark}** than it is for Washington]{.underline}, and the [[only
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} I can imagine in [which China would
attack Taiwan would be if Taiwan declared formal
independence]{.underline}---which [Taiwan's constitution makes
[virtually **impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[or if the U.S.
established diplomatic relations or signed a formal defense treaty with
Taiwan]{.underline}," the Heritage expert said.

[If Taiwan did declare independence]{.underline} from China, or if the
U.S. established formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, such an action
would [likely "trigger" a military response from China and]{.underline}
"lead \[Chinese leader\] **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping to
[conclude]{.underline} that [he **must act** to **preserve** his
**legitimacy**]{.underline} as China's leader," Cunningham said.

But apart from such developments, the [policy expert says]{.underline},
"[[**China**'s]{.mark} leaders **[can't afford]{.mark}** to attempt [to
**take Taiwan**]{.mark} by force unless they're convinced they can win
at a politically acceptable cost, and **[Xi]{.mark}** and the rest of
the leadership [**don't believe** there is **a path for**]{.mark} such a
low-risk **[victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[Even if China succeeded]{.underline} in an invasion of Taiwan, [such a
**[conflict]{.mark}** would **[create "social and economic havoc" in
China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Cunningham said, adding that a [conflict
could even **[jeopardize]{.mark}** the **[CCP's]{.mark}
[control]{.mark}** of China.]{.underline}

[[China has **little to**]{.mark} **[gain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
**[everything to]{.mark} [lose]{.mark}** by altering the world's current
geopolitical trajectory]{.underline}.

A [[new narrative]{.mark} is gaining ground]{.underline}, stating that
[[China]{.mark} is [likely to invade Taiwan]{.mark} in the near
future]{.underline}. The [reasoning is straightforward]{.underline}: The
[Trump]{.underline} administration's [tariff war]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the potential [decoupling of the Chinese and U.S.
economies]{.underline}, is [removing the main reason China has long had
for holding back]{.underline} in the first place. Without access to the
lucrative U.S. market, China has little left to lose, and will thus
finally unleash its imperial ambitions on its smaller neighbor.

This **[[view is mistaken]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Despite
what]{.underline} some U.S. [politicians seem to think]{.underline}, the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is **[not the beginning and
end]{.mark}** of China's foreign economic relation]{.underline}s. In
fact, [China's largest trading partner today is the European
Union.]{.underline} The U.S. is close behind, but then again so is the
combined weight of Japan and South Korea. The [countries of Southeast
Asia,]{.underline} meanwhile, are together a [larger export destination
for China]{.underline} than either the U.S. or the EU. None of these
actors is as invested in Taiwan's future as the U.S. is, but neither are
they indifferent to war and peace and the breakdown of global order.
[[With an escalating trade war]{.underline}]{.mark} with the United
States, **[[China needs stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in those
relationships more than ever]{.underline}.

[[China's key consideration]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [not economic but **[strategic]{.mark}**.
It]{.underline} is the [**[historic shift]{.mark}** [now underway in
geopolitical alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and how it affects China's
options]{.underline} [and strategies]{.underline} going forward. The
[[Trump]{.mark} administration is not only tearing at the fabric of the
U.S.-led economic order]{.underline}; [it is also **[fatally
undermining]{.mark}** the [military alliances]{.mark}]{.underline} that
his predecessors have spent decades to build. [[Xi]{.mark} Jinping
[**has no reason** to interrupt him]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact,
[China's path forward]{.underline} as a rising great power has [never
looked smoother]{.underline}. To fully appreciate the magnitude of
China's improved position, it is useful to briefly review U.S. grand
strategy until now.

Since the [United States]{.underline} started viewing China as a serious
geopolitical competitor in the 2000s, it has [pursued a dual strategy of
constructive engagement]{.underline} on the one hand, [and strategic
containment]{.underline} on the other. By integrating China into the
liberal world economy, the U.S. hoped to socialize China into an
acquiescent democracy, while tapping into its economic resources.
Although the former failed dismally, U.S. corporations made untold
billions and U.S. consumers got used to spending beyond their means,
thanks to the exorbitant privilege of the U.S. dollar.

[As China's wealth, power, and ambitions kept growing]{.underline},
however[, U.S. strategy tilted ever further toward strategic
containment]{.underline}. The United States sought to reinforce its
alliances in China's immediate neighborhood as well as globally, while
cultivating more neutral countries on China's periphery. The aim was to
buttress the primacy of the U.S.-led economic and military order, while
throwing a wrench into the works of China's global ambitions. At key
moments, the U.S. has pressured its allies -- from Europe to Asia to
Oceania -- to abstain from joining China-led institutions and
agreements, or from collaborating with China in sensitive areas. The aim
has been to frustrate China's attempts at regional or global leadership,
while blocking, or at least slowing down, its acquisition of the most
cutting-edge technologies.

This [strategy]{.underline}, of course, [relies on the willingness of
U.S. allies and partners to play along]{.underline}. [But [given]{.mark}
the [depth of China's economic integration]{.mark}]{.underline} with
both Europe and the rest of East Asia, [[maintaining]{.mark} such a
[coalition]{.mark} was [never going to be easy]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the early 2010s, as China-EU relations grew apace, many in Europe
started wondering why the U.S. desire for hegemony in the western
Pacific was any of their concern in the first place. Indeed, [U.S.
containment efforts sometimes failed]{.underline}. In 2015, the Obama
administration was left humiliated when more or less all of its allies
-- save for Japan -- lined up to join China's new Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank despite Washington's intense lobbying to the contrary.
After all, considering the depth of the United States' own exposure to
China, why would Europeans shy away from Beijing's offerings?

The answer, ultimately, was provided by Russia's Vladimir Putin as he
invaded Ukraine, shattering European illusions of immunity to global
conflict. Having neglected their own defenses for a generation,
Europeans had no choice but to fall back hard on the U.S. security
guarantee. Outraged by China's tacit support of Russia, Europeans were
also increasingly willing to get in line and do Washington's bidding
vis-à-vis Beijing. When the United States demanded that ASML's advanced
lithography machines be kept out of Chinese hands, for example, the
Dutch government put up export restrictions.

Nevertheless, the future of European involvement in a potential
China-U.S. confrontation remained uncertain. The first Trump
administration did tremendous damage to the transatlantic alliance that
was not easily forgotten in European capitals. Worse still, although the
Biden administration reaffirmed U.S. security commitments to NATO, its
foreign economic policy showed more continuity than change from his
predecessor. Friendlier rhetoric notwithstanding, "America First" was
the new bipartisan economic paradigm. The war in Ukraine helped paper
over some of these differences, but, beneath the surface, some difficult
questions remained about the future of transatlantic relations.

Against this backdrop, it is [clear]{.underline} that expecting European
allies to follow the [United States into an escalating confrontation
with China was always going to be a big thing to ask]{.underline} --
even when being a U.S. ally had real value. The new Trump
administration, by contrast, has worked hard to reduce that value to
zero. (And arguably to less than zero for Canada or Denmark, whose
territory Trump openly covets.) If Europeans had lingering questions
about the reliability of the United States as an ally, those questions
have been conclusively answered in the last three months.

In less than a hundred days, [Trump has achieved what U.S. adversaries
couldn't dream of in a hundred years]{.underline}: [He has
simultaneously torpedoed the credibility of the U.S.
economy]{.underline} as a safe haven for international business and
capital, while at the same time doing irreparable damage to the very
alliances that the United States needs in order to prevail in its
competition with China in the coming decades. [Indeed, if U.S. alliances
survive this period at all, they will be of a much weaker and more
transactional nature]{.underline}. They will certainly not be the types
of alliances in which Europeans blindly stake their economic and
security interests on a global confrontation to defend U.S. hegemony.

As things stand now, Trump has set the United States up to confront
China alone. This development constitutes a strategic victory for China
whose significance is hard to overstate. A few months ago, China was
facing a revitalized coalition of advanced democracies, united by their
horror of the invasion of Ukraine, and dismayed by China's tacit support
of it. Today, the United States has unmistakably taken Moscow's side,
while launching a multi-pronged attack on the European project. With
U.S. credibility in tatters, the world is now hurtling toward the kind
of multipolar order that Beijing has always dreamed of.

[[For Xi]{.mark} Jinping,]{.underline} [[it would]{.mark} therefore [be
a **strategic blunder**]{.mark} **of epic proportions**]{.underline}
[[to alter the current course]{.mark} of events]{.underline} [[by
invading]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline}. Indeed, the [only thing that could
conceivably salvage U.S. alliances]{.underline} at this point [is a
major global crisis]{.underline} that forces U.S. allies back into the
fold. [[Xi would have to be **extraordinarily
short-sighted**]{.underline} [to hand Trump such a
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} [just as his adversary's alliances are
falling apart.]{.underline}

That being said, the United States does not have a monopoly on rash
decisions and self-sabotaging behavior. Indeed, China's desire to annex
Taiwan should not be underestimated, nor should the sheer fury and
misplaced sense of wounded pride that fuels it. Through no fault of its
own, Taiwan's position is and will remain precarious. But [if there is
any trace of strategic acumen in Beijing]{.underline}, **[[China will
bide its time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Rather than starting a
war]{.underline}, [[Xi will]{.mark} **simply [sit
back]{.mark}**]{.underline} and watch as Trump "liberates" the U.S. from
its global influence.

### AT: China\-\--No Taiwan\-\--2NC

#### No brink for Taiwan invasion. 

Joe **Keary \'25** \[Joe Keary is a senior analyst at ASPI. \"Still not
confident enough: China isn't likely to move on Taiwan in 2025\",

**[Despite]{.underline}** China's rapid [military **improvements**, it's
**[unlikely]{.mark}** to use **[large-scale force against
Taiwan]{.mark}** in 2025]{.underline}. The Chinese [leadership's
[concerns over]{.mark}]{.underline} the quality of
[[military]{.underline}]{.mark} command, [[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}
weakening, uncertain [social stability]{.underline} and effects of the
Trump administration will likely [**[forestall]{.mark}** any large scale
**military maneuver**.]{.underline}

However, China will continue to ramp up pressure against Taiwan across
2025.

On 6 January, the United States' new defense secretary, [Pete
Hegseth]{.underline}, told the Senate Armed Services Committee he
[believed a Chinese Communist Party fait accompli invasion of Taiwan was
the pacing risk scenario for the Department of Defense.]{.underline} He
reminded the committee that 'Xi Jinping has openly expressed his
intention to annex Taiwan to mainland China' and 'has told his military
to be prepared to use force to achieve such an outcome by 2027'.

Like its successes in artificial intelligence, improvements in China's
military should not be underestimated. In several areas, China's
military is now reaching standards typical of the US military. China's
navy is transforming rapidly and by the end of 2025 is expected to have
395 ships, including three operational aircraft carriers. China is also
improving its amphibious fleet, acquiring assault ships that can carry
large numbers of landing craft, troops, fixed wing drones, armored
vehicles and helicopters. In early 2025, there were reports of China
building special barges that would support Taiwan landings.

China's military now has the largest aviation force in the region, with
new fighters and stealth aircraft that expand its ability to operate
farther from its shores. It is also increasing its inventory of nuclear
weapons and now has the world's leading arsenal of hypersonic missiles.
The army has increased the number of troops along the Taiwan Strait and
improved its firepower, mobility, and rapid strike capabilities.

Throughout 2024, China's military and coast guard continued to exercise
Taiwan invasion and blockade scenarios. In May, following the
inauguration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, Beijing launched
large-scale military exercises, surrounding Taiwan within two days. In
October, it undertook a second series of drills, taking just one day to
implement a mock blockade or quarantine of Taiwan. In December, China
staged its largest show of force in decades, showing the world how it
could repel a foreign force approaching Taiwan.

[The **military** has dramatically **improved** its **ability to
conduct** a blockade or **invasion**, but **[Beijing]{.mark}** will
[still **have doubts**]{.mark}.]{.underline} During the release of the
2024 China Military Power Report, senior [Pentagon officials said,
'[despite]{.mark} its [rapid progress]{.mark}, the [force]{.mark} has
**[not yet demonstrated]{.mark}** the **[type and scale]{.mark}** of
sophisticated **urban warfare** or long-distance logistic capabilities
that would **likely be [required for]{.mark}** [operations against
**Taiwan'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A [lack of combat
experience]{.underline} is a significant imposition for a force wanting
to undertake complicated operations across the Taiwan Strait.
**[Exercising will only get you so far.]{.underline}**

Serious questions have also been asked about China's officer corps and
their ability to 'judge situations, understand higher authorities'
intentions, make operational decisions, deploy troops, and deal with
unexpected situations'. [Corruption also remains an endemic
issue]{.underline}, with China's [[military experiencing]{.mark} a new
wave of [corruption]{.mark}-related scandals]{.underline} over the past
two years that has led to the removal of two defense ministers and a
high-ranking member of China's Central Military Commission.

[[Domestic factors]{.underline}]{.mark} will also [influence any
decision to use military force]{.underline}. China is facing adverse
demographic trends, including an [aging population and low birth
rates]{.underline}. There are other internal struggles, such as a trend
of [[rising violence]{.underline}]{.mark}, following a string of
[indiscriminate mass attacks]{.underline} throughout 2024.

China is also seeking to [manage a [faltering
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, worsened by ballooning [local [government
debt]{.mark}]{.underline}, a loss of [investor confidence and the
gradual [collapse of]{.mark} its [real estate]{.mark} sector. Beijing
has struggled to stimulate domestic consumption]{.underline}, relying on
its growing share of global exports to drive the economy. Researchers at
Rhodium Group estimated that China's GDP was only 2.4 to 2.8 percent
higher in 2024 than a year earlier, well below official claim of 5.0
percent growth.

China's trade surplus reached a new high of nearly US\$1trillion in
2024. [Beijing will be wary of the impact of a potential trade war with
the United States. It will want to strengthen its trade relationships
with other partners to reinforce its economy]{.underline}. China has
already sought to recalibrate ties with Japan, India and Australia,
while doubling down on its engagement with the Global South. Within this
context, [[China]{.mark} will want to perform a **careful balancing
act** over Taiwan. It [will **not want to damage international
relationships**]{.mark} by taking unnecessarily aggressive military
actions.]{.underline}

Amid the problems, the leadership nonetheless probably has growing
confidence that, if called upon, the military will be able to 'resolve
the Taiwan issue'. However, [Xi probably hasn't yet decided to use force
against Taiwan]{.underline}.

2027 almost certainly remains a short-term goal for military
modernization, not a date for a Taiwan invasion. [Concerns over the
**[economy]{.mark}** and **[social stability]{.mark}** will
[remain]{.mark} as [key **priorities**]{.mark} for China's
leadership]{.underline}.

Xi will also want to carefully assess the Trump administration's resolve
on the Taiwan issue. Trump has hinted at a more transactional approach
to Taiwan, suggesting it contribute more to its own security while still
supporting Taipei's right to self-defense. Trump is already threatening
tariffs on Taiwan's semiconductors.

In 2025, [China's]{.underline} military will [continue]{.underline} to
undertake [exercises around Taiwan]{.underline} as part of a broader
coercion campaign against Taipei. However, the [**[likelihood]{.mark}**
of large-scale use of force against Taiwan in 2025 **[remains
low.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Geography [mitigates]{.underline} any risk.

Hundreds of billions have either been spent or pledged to defend Taiwan.
Yet [Taiwan's [greatest defensive advantage is]{.mark} the main island
of **[Taiwan itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [island's
**[terrain]{.mark}** is wholly [**unsuited** for]{.mark} the kind of
massive [military **invasion**]{.mark} policymakers use to justify
defense budget increases resulting is more than \$1 trillion American
annual defense budgets.]{.underline} A careful study of Taiwan's
geography including on-the-ground observations reveal [eight significant
challenges an invader would have to overcome to successfully conquer the
island.]{.underline}

The following draws from my recent research on the island and will be
fleshed out in a forthcoming report from the Stimson Center.

First, [an invader would have to **cross the [Taiwan
Strait]{.mark}**]{.underline} to reach the island. An invasion force
would [include huge numbers of people, vehicles, and
supplies]{.underline}. The [[only way to transport]{.underline}]{.mark}
the bulk of such a force [is with surface shipping]{.underline} which
would be [[**extremely vulnerable** to submarines]{.mark}, underwater
mines, long-range missiles, and now uncrewed attack
vessels.]{.underline}

Second, [Taiwan's [extensive shoreline]{.mark} provides [few]{.mark}
acceptable [landing options]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [majority of the
island is covered by mountains]{.underline} and in most places, the
[mountains drop straight into the sea]{.underline}. An invader would
have to establish a beachhead away from the cliffs, but all of these
areas present two deeply troublesome military challenges.

Third, [if the invader secures a foothold, it would then need to build
up combat power ashore for the eventual breakout assault to capture the
rest of the island]{.underline}. Again, Taiwan's water-intensive
agricultural land would make that difficult. The invader wouldn't be
able to stage people and vehicles in rice paddies. They would fare
better doing so in developed port facilities, but they would still have
to do so while fighting within the city.

Fourth, the invader would need to successfully breakout from the
beachhead. [Taiwan's usable beaches lead either directly into a city or
into farmland.]{.underline} [Landing into a city creates means the
[invader]{.mark} [would immediately be confronted]{.mark} by urban
combat.]{.underline} Landing [outside of the cities means]{.underline}
the invader would crash across the beach only to then [immediately
become mired in the island's extensive agricultural land]{.underline}
which consists mainly of rice paddies.

Fifth, the invader would have to figure out how to fight across Taiwan's
landscape. Armored vehicles can't drive through rice paddies. Tanks and
armored personnel carriers, which would be needed in massive quantities
to protect soldiers in the open terrain and cities, would need to stick
to the island's road network. Surface roads through the rice paddies
provide a single lane in each direction at best.

An advancing armored force that gets stopped when the lead vehicle is
destroyed by the defenders would not be able to drive around the new
obstacle because the tanks would get stuck in water-logged fields. The
only option would be to turn around and find another route. The
defenders would be able to pull off the same trick again and again. It
would be much faster for the invader to use Taiwan's highway network,
but these roads are often elevated which means the defender needs only
to drop sections of the road to completely disrupt forward movement.
Again, the invading force would not be able to easily bypass such an
obstacle because it would require driving through rice paddies.

Sixth, the invader will have to contend with the island's formidable
natural obstacles restricting movements towards the ultimate objective
in Taipei. Along the western plain of the island, the mountains reach
all the way to the sea in several places creating narrow passes through
which an invader would have to fight. The Yilan plain on the island's
east coast offers long stretches of inviting landing beaches, but an
invader would have to fight directly through the mountains to reach
Taipei along a highway that includes numerous bridges spanning deep
river valleys and long tunnels bored through rock.

The island's natural obstacles provide the Taiwanese with the ability to
create a layered defense.Seventh, Greater Taipei occupies a massive
ancient lakebed in the northern part of the island. Mountains surround
the city which is only accessible on the ground through narrow passes.
One such pass is so narrow that the highway winding through it is
elevated the entire way with opposing traffic lanes stacked vertically.
Another pass is a little wider but it has been developed into
essentially a long city with a winding river running through the middle
creating a mile's long obstacle protecting the approaches to Taipei.

Lastly, [if an invader overcomes all of these challenges, they will
still have to contend with Taipei proper.]{.underline} The metropolitan
area covers 250 square kilometers. The city is very dense with
relatively little open space at street level. A significant proportion
of the city's buildings rise above 20 stories. [The [scale of a]{.mark}
contested [battle over Taipei]{.mark} is almost [impossible to
comprehend.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The closest equivalent in history would be the Battle of Stalingrad in
World War II]{.underline}. That city had a population of approximately
850,000 in 1940. During the six months the Germans and Soviets fought
for control of the city, upwards of 2 million people were killed as the
armies fought block by block. Greater Taipei today has a population of
well over 7 million.

[There are various strategic, political, and economic reasons why
China's leaders are much more likely pursue their goal of gaining
political control of Taiwan through means other than a massive military
invasion]{.underline}. But because American policymakers and military
planners continue to cite the Chinese threat to Taiwan as the principal
scenario around which to craft their proposals, it's important to
understand realities on the ground there.

With only a basic understanding of [Taiwan's complex
terrain]{.underline}, it becomes [**[immediately obvious]{.mark}** that
there are [**few places** on Earth **less suitable**]{.mark} for what
would be the **largest** single **military operation in
history**]{.underline}. The doyens of the national security
establishment may need to find a new pacing threat.

Key Points -- China's potential [[military conquest]{.mark} of
Taiwan]{.underline}, a core objective for President Xi Jinping, [[would
involve immense challenges]{.mark} despite]{.underline} Beijing's
growing [military might.]{.underline}

An [invasion]{.underline} would likely [start with a blockade and
quarantine]{.underline}, [followed by a complex amphibious
assault]{.underline}.

However, [[Taiwan benefits from early warning]{.underline}]{.mark}
(satellite detection of Chinese troop/ship movements), [[limited]{.mark}
suitable [landing]{.mark} [beaches]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[difficult
mountainous terrain]{.underline}]{.mark}** favoring defenders,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its own
[[missile]{.underline}]{.mark}/artillery
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

While China could attempt a "shock and awe" bombardment of Taipei, the
[success]{.underline} [of an invasion hinges on unpredictable
factors]{.underline}: [Taiwan's will to resist, the effectiveness of its
defenses, and crucially, whether the United States intervenes
militarily]{.underline}.

Could China Conquer Taiwan?

The reunification of Taiwan is the most pressing geopolitical issue
facing China. The Chinese government and its people are obsessed with
Taiwan. President Xi Jinping thinks he will be judged by history on how
he handles the future of the island nation.

His [presidency is in the balance]{.underline}, and [failure on the
Taiwan]{.underline} issue is [not an option]{.underline}. China believes
that Taiwan is a renegade province that must be annexed and brought back
into the fold. Xi prefers that unification be accomplished by political
and diplomatic means, but he has not ruled out annexation by military
force.

[Blockade and Quarantine Could Come First]{.underline}

This could mean an initial blockade and quarantine to cut off food and
energy supplies to Taiwan, followed by an amphibious attack to invade
the island. Both **[[moves are risky]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially
if the United States decides to intervene. But China has the ships,
airplanes, ballistic missiles, and ground forces to bring Taiwan to its
knees, especially if the Americans stay out of the fight.

China's 'Grey Zone' Activity Looks Like Action Is Imminent

China rehearses blockades and attacks on Taiwan through its "[[Grey
Zone" tactics]{.mark} that are **[short]{.mark} [of
war]{.mark}**]{.underline} but more intense than peace. [[Ships]{.mark}
have [surrounded the island before]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese fighter
jets and bombers often fly close to the island to simulate an attack and
intimidate the Taiwanese government.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, the island dwellers are convinced it could
happen to them, too. There is hope that the Taiwanese can fight China to
a standstill, but they are also afraid that China could overwhelm all
their defenses and defeat them. [[China]{.mark} has [not fought a war
**since a 1979**]{.mark}]{.underline} scrap with Vietnam, but they take
training seriously and have the major end items to make an attack a
success. An [[amphibious landing]{.underline}]{.mark} would be one of
the [**[most complex operations]{.mark}** in the modern era]{.underline}
-- [much more complicated than the Russian invasion]{.underline} of
Ukraine.

China Would Marshall All Resources for an Attack

Xi's military would first have to move amphibious attack ships and other
military hardware to the eastern edge of China, and the United States
would be able to spot this mass of soldiers and end items from
intelligence satellites. So Taiwan would have early warning. China's
amphibious ship count is not high, but they would use the coast guard
and perhaps even civilian ships to haul soldiers and materiel across the
Taiwan Strait.

But It Won't Be Easy for China

There are [[**not many beaches** in Taiwan]{.mark} suitable for an
amphibious operation]{.underline}, and the [[landing zone would be
shallow]{.underline}]{.mark}, meaning that [ships would have to move far
away]{.underline} from the shore. These vessels would be targets for
Taiwan's missiles and artillery. [[Taiwan]{.mark} has also [placed
**mines**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and **conventional
obstructions**]{.underline}]{.mark} (iron spikes) at landing locations.

The Council on Foreign Relations describes the [difficulty of an
invasion]{.underline}. The [[terrain]{.mark} of Taiwan also **[favors
the defenders]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Mountain peaks]{.underline} are
as [high as 12,000 feet]{.underline}. Once China lands, the [[Taiwanese
can launch]{.mark} [a **guerrilla campaign**]{.mark} from]{.underline}
[the hills to prevent China from gaining total control]{.underline}. The
[east coast]{.underline} of Taiwan is [not friendly to an amphibious
attack]{.underline} due to rocky terrain, so China would have to focus
on the west coast. China [would have to cross several
rivers]{.underline}, and there are [few roads in the west]{.underline}.
[[China's]{.mark} [tanks]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} self-propelled
[[artillery]{.underline}]{.mark}, and armored [personnel carriers could
[get **bogged down.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Would Taipei Give Up and Its Government Capitulate?

However, China would bombard Taipei with artillery, ballistic missiles
from shore, bombs from airplanes, and missiles from ships and
submarines. Airplanes could destroy targets, and all of this firepower
could convince the Taiwanese to give up after a "shock and awe"
campaign. This would take several days, if not weeks, to bomb Taipei
into submission. Of course, Russia tried to take Kyiv in a lightning
strike, too, but was unsuccessful.

To answer and hold the city, [Taiwan could also block
highways]{.underline}, [tunnels]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
[city's port to keep Taipei from being invaded]{.underline} by Chinese
ground troops.

But this assumes that Taiwan has the will to fight and that the
Americans do not attack the Chinese amphibious ships. Taiwan could give
up immediately or mount a successful challenge that could prolong the
war for weeks if not months. This is difficult to predict.

Taiwan is spending more money on defense and recruiting additional
personnel for its army, but will that be enough?

China is not disguising how it rehearses for an attack. In 2024, after a
major simulated invasion, the Americans and the Taiwanese took note.

Admiral Samuel Paparo, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said
that the notional exercise "looked like a rehearsal" for an invasion.
"We watched it. We took note. We learned from it. And they helped us
prepare for the future."

Overall, this potential war between Taiwan and China will boil down to
the will of the individual soldiers. If Taiwan can mirror the bravery,
staying power, and ingenuity of Ukrainian personnel, a Chinese attack on
the island will fail. However, they could also capitulate early, and the
government could fall, even if Taiwanese defenders mount a guerrilla
campaign; Taipei could ultimately give up. Meanwhile, China could
execute the attack to perfection, but there would be a [**"[fog of
war]{.mark}"** that would [favor the defenders.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The United States is the wild card in this scenario. China assumed that
the Americans would stay out of the battle. President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} has [not said if he would try to stop]{.underline}
the Chinese, but former President Joe Biden did claim he would command
the U.S. military to prevent an attack.

China could try the quarantine and blockade first to stop all fuel
supplies and food going into Taiwan and see how the Americans react. If
the United States shows reticence, the invasion may ensue. Then, the
Taiwanese would be expected to defend their country. It would be a
bloody fight for weeks, or Taipei could wave the white flag early.

Meanwhile, China will prepare and conduct additional simulations using
its Grey Zone tactics. If the invasion occurs in 2027, which is a widely
discussed date among China watchers, the United States and Taiwan will
have time to improve their defenses.

China will not give up when it comes to reunifying Taiwan, and Xi will
have constant pressure to "do something" about the Taiwan question. All
the Taiwanese and Americans can hope for is that Xi doesn't resort to a
military campaign.

From [[microchips]{.underline} [to maritime]{.underline}]{.mark}
[trade]{.underline}, the [stakes make [military action]{.mark} an
economic **[gamble Beijing can't take]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} has become a [[focal
point]{.underline}]{.mark} for the U.S.-China conflict, with the
Pentagon turning its attention towards a hypothetical conflict with
China --- referring to it as the "sole pacing threat" --- and [China
continuing combat and blockade drills]{.underline} around the island.

However, [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} China's [demonstrations of
military [power]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Taiwan's]{.mark} unique
**economic [niche]{.mark}** [and **geographic position**]{.mark} [make
it a]{.mark} particularly **[thorny target]{.mark}** for
Beijing]{.underline}. The [[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty's [legitimacy rests]{.mark}]{.underline} largely
[[on]{.mark} the robust [economy]{.mark}]{.underline} it has built, and
the [[direct]{.mark} economic [repercussions of an
invasion]{.mark}]{.underline} or blockade of Taiwan [[stand to **shatter
the foundations**]{.mark} of Beijing's domestic power.]{.underline}

There are [[three]{.mark} non-military [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} [a full military [assault]{.mark} or
blockade of Taiwan **a [nonviable]{.mark} option** for the
CCP]{.underline}. [First]{.underline} is the [global importance of
[Taiwan's **semiconductor**]{.mark} manufacturing base]{.underline},
[second is the [impact on **trade**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the shipping
industry]{.underline} running through the Taiwan Strait and Luzon
Strait, and [third is China's]{.underline} own [[less-than-favorable
**economic conditions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

The semiconductor issue

[Taiwan is the largest manufacturer of semiconductors]{.underline} in
the world. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) ---Taiwan's largest producer of semiconductors
--- took a 67.1% market share of all chips globally, and produced nearly
all of the most advanced chips. There is **[[no viable replacement for
Taiwan's manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the semiconductor
market; not only does the nation represent a massive share of the chip
industry, its infrastructure uniquely supports the scale and quality of
production.

Semiconductors represent an irreplaceable enabler of global economic
activities. [[If Taiwan were to stop producing]{.mark}
[chips]{.mark}]{.underline}, [both the American and Chinese
economies]{.underline} --- not to mention the world economy --- [would
contract and [ignite a **global depression**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chips
enable electrical grids, manufacturing, home utilities, automobiles, and
more; they have permeated every facet of the global economy.

Semiconductors are not an end in themselves, they are a means to an end,
enabling innovation and emerging technologies like AI and robotics.
Taiwan's dominance in this critical market is referred to as its
"silicon shield," which means that the U.S. and China are invested in
protecting its output.

An [[offensive]{.mark} or blockade against the island
nation]{.underline} would [have a profound global economic
impact]{.underline}. The most important global economies rely on the
chips manufactured in Taiwan. With demand for chips only growing, losing
Taiwan\'s manufacturing base could [[**throttle global supply chains**
for years]{.mark} to come]{.underline}.

Inefficacy of military action

[[Chinese military action]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[disrupt]{.mark}
the [global commerce]{.mark}]{.underline} running [through the Taiwan
and Luzon Straits]{.underline}. The [straits on either side of
Taiwan]{.underline} are thoroughfares for international trade, with
Taiwan's own ports [handling \$586 billion in trade in
2022]{.underline}, and an [[estimated \$2.45 trillion]{.mark} transiting
the strait in the same time period]{.underline}. Besides Taiwan, China's
ports are most likely to be impacted, with ships diverting from the
ports along China's eastern coast.

While global shipping lanes can likely divert around a conflict zone
without significantly raising prices, [China's]{.underline} [role in
maritime shipping infrastructure]{.underline} [means]{.underline} that
[conflict would have a direct negative impact on some of China's most
lucrative ports]{.underline} and port cities, with ships no longer
making stops along a broad swath of the coast.

Ships will not be able to access the extensive network of maintenance
and repair sites along the Chinese coast, as well as cargo processing
sites. The loss of access to some of these ports would have knock-on
effects for the global shipping industry if there is a protracted
conflict or blockade, leaving remaining ports to deal with the
spillover.

Geopolitically, [China would have to reckon with the Global South and
BRICS]{.underline} nations, whose [trade relies on the straits even more
than the G7]{.underline}. Given that [China]{.underline} is
[courting]{.underline} [these nations diplomatically]{.underline},
[impeding their trade]{.underline} could [set off a **diplomatic
fiasco**]{.underline} that Beijing would likely want to avoid.

Already **[[poor economic conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[not in a strong]{.mark} economic
[position]{.mark}]{.underline} as it has been [reined in by the
lingering aftereffects of its **[real estate
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[subdued]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[domestic [consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark}
the impacts]{.underline} and **[[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}**
created [by the [trade war]{.mark}'s tariffs]{.underline}. Kicking off a
[global crisis]{.underline} would likely [[exacerbate]{.mark} the
[economic issues]{.mark} it currently faces]{.underline}. Furthermore,
Taiwan represents up to 60% of China's own chip imports. [[If China
attacks]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline} it [[stands to]{.mark} ~~cripple~~
\[[hamstring]{.mark}\] its own industries]{.underline} by starving them
of chips. Besides chips imports, the [[PRC]{.mark} is [heavily
dependent]{.mark} on trade]{.underline} --- comprising 37% of its GDP
--- [[making it]{.underline}]{.mark} even [more
**[vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to disruptions in global trade.

According to a study done by Bloomberg Economics, [[in the event of a
blockade]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[global GDP]{.mark} would be [down
5%,]{.mark}]{.underline} with China and the U.S. seeing shrinkage of
8.9% and 3.3%, respectively. And in the event of an invasion, global GDP
would be down 10.2%, with South Korea, Japan, and other East Asian
nations seeing the worst of the impact. The resulting \$10 trillion
price tag on merely the first year of the crisis incentivizes the
stakeholders to avoid confrontation. If any or all of Taiwan's foundries
are destroyed, the impact would be even greater and the economic
depression would last for a decade or more as nations attempt to build
out their own profitable foundries. Not to mention that this would
likely create a permanent rift between China and trade with the U.S. and
the EU.

While both China and the U.S. attempt to relieve their respective
reliance on Taiwanese chips through domestic production, Taiwan retains
its most advanced nodes on its territory in order to maintain global
dependence on its chips industry. Cajoling from both the U.S. and China
has brought TSMC investment and factories to both nations, but these
nodes do not represent a viable replacement for Taiwan's output.

[Given these three factors]{.underline}, China would have to be certain
that it would be able to take Taiwan quickly, and with minimal damage to
the delicate foundries and their personnel. With an ongoing purge of the
PLA due to corruption concerns, it [seems there is either [widespread
corruption]{.mark} or a political purge]{.underline}, both of which
[[put a damper]{.mark} on readiness]{.underline}. If [[Xi's generals are
corrupt]{.underline}]{.mark} that means **[[readiness isn't where it
should be]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if it's a political purge then it
impacts morale and cohesion.

If Taiwan shapes itself into a high-stakes/low value target it can
remain largely untouchable because of the economic structures
surrounding it. These economic shields could compound if Taiwan engages
in military strategies such as becoming a "porcupine," to make itself a
hard military target as well --- engaging in anti-access/area denial
strategies with high volumes of antiship missiles, sea mines, and air
defense systems.

Taiwan\'s main value to China is through its nationalistic claims to the
island. China's issue with Taiwanese independence also hinges on U.S.
assurances that it will not deny China access to the lagging edge chips
Taiwan's foundries export to China and that it will not separate the
island from the mainland.

As long as the island does not move towards independence and continues
to "porcupine," the structural economic factors play to the island\'s
advantage, making it easier for the Chinese to ignore the situation, for
now, to maintain the favorable economic conditions of the region.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

An [[invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan]{.underline} would [[deprive Beijing of
**foreign capital**]{.underline}, **[critical technology]{.underline}**
[and **tax revenue**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

A sea and air [[blockade]{.underline}]{.mark} of Taiwan would also
[[hurt China]{.mark}'s own economy]{.underline}.

Beijing might attempt to limit direct U.S. confrontation --- but any
loss of life on Taiwan's side would lead to escalation.

When Lai Ching-te was inaugurated as Taiwan's new president in May, he
thanked supporters "for refusing to be swayed by external forces" and
called on China to cease "political and military intimidation." Days
later, Beijing sent its own blunt message to Taiwan's newly elected
president. China's army, navy, air and rocket forces converged in nearby
waters to test its readiness to "reunify" with Taiwan, whether or not
the self-ruled island --- or any of its international supporters ---
shared the same objective. Such Chinese military drills around the
Taiwan Strait point to one of the world's most combustible threats, a
potential conflict between China and Taiwan that draws in the United
States and wreaks havoc with the global economy.

Beijing fears Taiwan's leaders are pushing the island closer to
independence, and the window for reversing such a course is closing. But
[any military action China takes to steer Taiwan]{.underline} [away from
independence risks not only significant loss of life on both sides of
the Strait]{.underline} --- it could also [force nuclear-armed powers
China and the U.S. into a series of escalatory actions]{.underline} that
endanger security and trade throughout Asia. At a minimum, it [would
disrupt commercial ship traffic and upend the global supply
chain]{.underline} for [semiconductor chips]{.underline} that feed
smartphones, automobiles and home appliances.
[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [[economy]{.mark} would be [severely
affected]{.mark}]{.underline} as well.

That [potential for a wider conflict and trade turmoil]{.underline} is
what [Beijing must weigh]{.underline} when deciding whether to take
Taiwan by force. It's not clear how high a price China's leader, Xi
Jinping, who has consolidated his control over the ruling Communist
Party, is willing to pay to alter a tense status quo. Any option he
considers --- whether that's a full-scale invasion, some sort of trade
blockade or a more limited attack on Taiwan's outlying islands or
infrastructure --- threatens to spiral into something larger.

The 'Astronomical' Price Tag of Conflict

Bloomberg Economics has [[estimated]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} with
Taiwan]{.underline} would [[cost a staggering **\$10
trillion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, equivalent to **[[10% of global
GDP]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- far outpacing the economic toll from
Ukraine's war, the COVID pandemic and the 2007-2008 global financial
crisis. [[China's]{.mark} [GDP]{.mark} would
[suffer]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[16.7% blow]{.underline}]{.mark}**
compared to 40% for what would be a devastated Taiwanese economy.

Bloomberg Economics also modeled the fallout from a military blockade of
the island, including retaliatory measures between China and the U.S. It
estimated a 12.2% hit to Taiwan's economy, 8.9% for the Chinese mainland
and 3.3% for the U.S.

Some experts say the [economic damage]{.underline} from a China-Taiwan
clash [is steeper if the final price tag includes the costs of foreign
investors]{.underline} [exiting]{.underline} the Chinese mainland and
neighboring island for safer but less-productive --- and less-lucrative
--- locations.

"[It would be astronomical]{.underline}," said Paul Triolo, a partner
for China and technology policy at Albright Stonebridge Group, which
last year labeled a miscalculation involving Taiwan as the advisory
firm's "top wild card risk."

[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} multinational [[manufacturers]{.mark} with
operations in China]{.underline} are at least **[[exploring ways to
reduce exposure]{.underline}]{.mark}** to any cross-Strait conflict.
Some are putting plans into action by shifting operations to other
places in Asia, Europe and North America, according to Benjamin Qiu, a
U.S.-based attorney who specializes in cross-border disputes and
transactions.

"At the end of the day, everyone needs to think of what assets they have
at risk, similar to Russia when it invaded Ukraine," he said. "If you
don't start now, you are starting from zero when it happens."

[Moscow]{.underline} has been able to [blunt some of the economic
impact]{.underline} that followed its 2022 invasion of Ukraine by
selling discounted oil, skirting Western sanctions and raising domestic
taxes. [Russia]{.underline} has also [replaced the dollar with the
Chinese yuan]{.underline} as its primary currency of payment for its
exports, [deepening its economic dependence on China]{.underline}. Yet
the number of Russians killed in Ukraine is approaching 200,000, The
Wall Street Journal has reported, a sign of how catastrophically
President Vladimir Putin miscalculated the human costs of invading
Russia's neighbor.

[With a far bigger economy than Russia's]{.underline}, [China would have
more leverage than Moscow to resist U.S.-led efforts to isolate it after
an attack on Taiwan]{.underline}.

With a far bigger economy than Russia's, China would have more leverage
than Moscow to resist U.S.-led efforts to isolate it after an attack on
Taiwan. But [[China's integration with the global
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a manufacturing base and major
market]{.underline} would [**[complicate efforts]{.mark}** to avoid the
shocks from military action]{.underline} against Taiwan.

Costs to China from an Invasion

China's most recently concluded Joint Sword 2024A exercise, as well as
military drills near the island that followed the House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's 2022 visit to Taiwan, showcased how a coordinated Chinese force
might carry out a full invasion.

This boldest of military options may be the least likely, though. [[Even
with]{.mark} China's [firepower]{.mark} [overwhelming]{.mark}
Taiwan's]{.underline} defenses, an [amphibious [invasion would be a
**tough mission**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia botched its invasion of
Ukraine across a land border, despite having a military hardened from
conflicts in Syria and Chechnya. [**[China hasn't fought a war
since]{.mark}** a [brief invasion]{.mark} of neighboring
Vietnam]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} **[1979]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
[[taking a densely-populated]{.mark} and [well-fortified
island]{.mark}]{.underline} would be **[[exponentially more
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "An [[all-out invasion]{.mark} of
Taiwan would be]{.underline} an operation [[larger and **more
complicated**]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the World War II
**[Normandy]{.mark}** landings]{.underline}, but unlike the Allied
forces, the \[**[[China's\] military has never done such a
thing]{.underline}]{.mark}**," according to a joint report in May from
the American Enterprise Institute and the Institute for the Study of
War.

Just how the U.S. would respond to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan isn't
clear. In a simulation of a possible conflict between China and Taiwan,
researchers with the Center for a New American Security (CNAS) found
participants turned to a familiar punitive action: sanctions. Targeted
sanctions, however, were less effective in deterring Beijing from a
military campaign than the more sweeping actions of a full trade embargo
and severe restrictions on China's financial sector, including its major
banks. At the same time, maximum measures could boomerang on the U.S.
and allies, bruising economies and markets and potentially triggering a
global recession, according to a 2023 CNAS report, "No Winners in This
Game."

Rather than just absorbing blows from the U.S., China would surely
respond, risking further economic damage. Import bans, boycotts,
inspections and tariffs are among the measures it could use to bludgeon
Western companies and economies --- even if it meant endangering jobs
and investment in China tied to foreign firms, according to a 2024
report from the Atlantic Council's Geoeconomics Center and the Rhodium
Group, called "Retaliation and Resilience: China's Economic Statecraft
in a Taiwan Crisis."

A cross-Strait conflict is sure to ratchet up pressure on multinationals
to pull out of China, or at least reduce exposure, further depriving
Beijing of capital, technology as well as tax revenue for local
governments and jobs for the nation's restless youth. It would also
weigh on China's stock markets, threatening to erase the paper wealth of
its middle-class investors.

A military assault on Taiwan would spur China's propaganda machinery
into overdrive, amplifying a core Communist Party message that
reunification is central to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Chinese security forces would probably quash any real opposition to the
military action, but the [public protests that erupted in
2022]{.underline} over Xi's zero COVID campaign [show how unpredictable
the bottom-up reaction can be to top-down policies.]{.underline}

Costs to China from a Blockade

Short of an invasion, a full or partial blockade of Taiwan might, for
China, seem like an effective way to punish an import-dependent island
for pursuing independence. Patrolled by sea, air and potentially space,
a blockade would restrict commercial traffic to Taiwan, choking the
island's economy and depriving its semiconductor factories of the energy
and raw materials they need, including the critical mineral of gallium
that largely comes from China.

Dmitri Alperovitch, author of the book "World on the Brink," argues that
[[Beijing's moves to blockade]{.mark} Taiwan [would be
**self-defeating**]{.mark}]{.underline}, however. They would likely halt
shipments of the advanced microchips the Chinese economy needs to keep
technological pace with the U.S., not to mention undercutting the
economic integration it seeks with the island.

"There are [key reasons a Chinese economic blockade would
fail]{.underline}," Alperovitch writes for War on the Rocks. "It would
[rebound on China's own economy]{.underline}, most likely escalate into
a full-scale war, and entail serious geopolitical risk."

If China blocks exports from an island that accounts for about 90% of
the world's most advanced semiconductor capacity, the U.S. could
probably draw wide support for retaliatory measures of its own, possibly
even squeezing China at various maritime chokepoints.

Jin Canrong, dean of the School of International Studies at People's
University in Beijing, cautions that the [Chinese government would need
to brace for economic blowback if it moved to unite with Taiwan by
force]{.underline}. In a June article for the online platform
Guancha.cn, which examined prospects of "non-peaceful reunification,"
Jin writes that [**[China is economically
vulnerable]{.underline}**]{.mark} not only because it [relies heavily on
overseas markets to absorb the excess capacity]{.underline} from its
factories. It is also the [**[world's biggest food importer]{.mark}**
and [73% of its oil]{.mark} comes from [foreign]{.mark}
sources]{.underline} as well as 42% of its gas.

[Given the costs to China of a military-led blockade]{.underline} ---
which would also include soaring rates to insure ships in the area ---
Beijing might opt for more incremental moves that minimize the risks of
a direct U.S. confrontation, as it has done in the South China Sea,
where it has [built up positions while avoiding lethal
force]{.underline}.

People's Liberation Army forces may seize an outlying island or stage a
cyberattack on Taiwan's electric grid or attempt to take control of a
seaport, possibly as a precursor to a bigger operation.

While [Chinese military planners may bet Taiwan wouldn't retaliate in a
way that escalates tensions]{.underline}, a loss of life would probably
force the island's leaders to respond. Alperovitch points out that the
five busiest Chinese ports are within range of Taiwan's Ching Tien
supersonic cruise missile. Taiwan conducting such a strike would elevate
the tactics of Yemen's Houthi militants in firing missiles at commercial
vessels to disrupt maritime traffic in the Red Sea. In this tinderbox of
nationalist passions over Chinese sovereignty, risks are high that an
incremental escalation cascades into a conflict that can't be contained.

Moving Away from Military Action

[[Given]{.mark} the [costs]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}, there might
be an [[opportunity for both sides to explore]{.mark} a path to
[peace]{.mark}ful unification]{.underline}. How that might look in
practice would need to be worked out between China and Taiwan --- and
likely the U.S. In the wake of Putin's grab for Ukraine, and a
bipartisan consensus in Washington on tough positions toward Beijing,
such an outcome is difficult to envision. But given the risks of
missteps, says Triolo at Albright Stonebridge Group, it's worth
considering how all sides can reduce tensions, such as scaling back the
militarization of the Taiwan Strait. "That's what needs to happen," says
Triolo. "Otherwise, all roads lead to conflict."

To this end, the U.S. should encourage more interactions between leaders
of China and Taiwan that ease tensions and avoid violent confrontation.
U.S. policymakers should also lay out publicly key measures Washington
might consider in response to an invasion or significantly disruptive
action on the part of China, as part of efforts to deter such escalatory
steps while maintaining ambiguity over its military role in any
conflict. Additionally, foreign business groups in China should convey
in concrete terms the potential costs of a full-blown conflict to their
businesses, and by extension, to the Chinese economy that still relies
heavily on overseas investment.

[[Hype about]{.mark} emerging opportunities in [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
new [[Arctic]{.mark} has [generated misguided claims about]{.mark} a
'new great game' and alarmist views about [rivalry and conflict]{.mark}
on the new frontier.]{.underline}22 A stream of official reports,
strategy papers and news articles has promoted the view that the region
is ripe for conflict.23 A report from the French Ministry for the Armed
Forces, for example, referred to the Arctic as the 'new Middle East',
while US Secretary of State Pompeo has asked, 'do we want the Arctic
Ocean to transform into a new South China Sea, fraught with
militarization and competing territorial claims?'24

[The fact that non-polar countries]{.underline}, including China, India,
Japan, South Korea and members of the European Union, have [expressed
interest]{.underline} in securing access to the new Arctic has only
[increased concern]{.underline} that the 'North Pole could become the
world's next battlefield', as commentator Conn Hallinan put it.25
China's growing interest in the Arctic and its supposed status as a
'polar great power' has been particularly alarming for littoral states,
China's Asian neighbours and indeed the wider world.26 **[[Despite
China's]{.mark} self-styled 'near Arctic'
[status]{.mark},]{.underline}** however, **[its [power]{.mark} in the
region [is limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [its [behaviour]{.mark}
towards coastal states [has been]{.mark} largely
**[coop]{.mark}**erative and [free from challenges to]{.mark} their
[sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}.27

[[China has no]{.mark} military [presence]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and it is difficult to see how it could fulfil
Eleanor Ross's prediction that 'China's Arctic empire will upset the
global balance of power'.28 [Beijing has enhanced its]{.underline}
military, economic, technological and diplomatic [**coop**eration with
Russia]{.underline}, but **[[it is unlikely]{.mark} that [Moscow will
allow]{.mark} China to develop [military bases]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}** region any time soon. [China]{.underline} has
[sought]{.underline} a stronger [presence in Greenland]{.underline}, but
[this is hardly enough]{.underline} to shift the global balance of
power. [[Denmark]{.mark}, supported by the US,]{.underline} has [[pushed
back]{.underline}]{.mark} against China's initiative. Chinese
[researchers have been critical of Norway's]{.underline} imposition of
[new conditions]{.underline} regarding research activities at the
Ny-Ålesund research station on the island of Spitsbergen, but again,
[this is hardly a step towards]{.underline} a new great game or a
[conflict]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Small encroachments by China, a new superpower with growing global
interests, could challenge the interests of smaller coastal states and
the overall stability of the new Arctic. However, [**[Canada, Denmark
and Norway]{.mark} are capable of [manag]{.mark}**ing **any conflicts
arising from [competing interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Canada has
effectively managed its dispute with the United States over the
Northwest Passage, and Norway has similarly managed its maritime
disputes with the Soviet Union/Russia.

Strategic and military investments in the new Arctic could potentially
affect the balance of power in the region: China and Russia's
collaboration on missile defence, early-warning systems,
telecommunication and satellites is particularly worthy of attention. At
the same time, however, Russia remains wary of any potential Chinese
military presence in the Arctic. Meanwhile, [[China remains preoccupied
with]{.underline}]{.mark} pressing [[challenges at home and in East
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, meaning that [it can give only secondary
attention to its interests in the Arctic.]{.underline}

In its 2019 annual report to Congress on Chinese military and security
developments, the US Department of Defense stated that 'civilian
research could support a strengthened Chinese military presence in the
Arctic Ocean, which could include deploying submarines to the region as
a deterrent against nuclear attacks'.29 However, Chinese power
projection into the Arctic Ocean would necessitate sailing through the
first island chain in East Asian waters and the narrow and shallow
Bering Strait, heightening the risk that US and allied forces might
detect any Chinese submarine activity. [Once a [Chinese
**sub**]{.mark}marine arrived in the Arctic Ocean, it [would
need]{.mark} to rely on **coop**eration with [Russia]{.mark} to sustain
its presence]{.underline}. **[It is [unlikely]{.mark} that [Russia would
agree]{.mark}]{.underline}** to such cooperation. It is far more likely
that [Chinese **[sub]{.mark}**marine**[s]{.mark}** [will operate
in]{.mark} the relatively [secure, deeper]{.mark} waters of [the
**S**]{.mark}outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}. Such
patrols would be closer to home and protected by the People's Liberation
Army's growing military capabilities. [From these]{.underline}
relatively secure waters, [China could deploy its new]{.underline} JL-3
submarine-launched [ballistic missile]{.underline}, a capability that
could allow it to potentially hit the continental United States with a
nuclear warhead.30

[China]{.underline} is [ramping up its military
preparations]{.underline} for a conflict against Taiwan, the commander
of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command says.

Adm. Samuel J. Paparo spoke Friday at a conference at the McCain
Institute in Arizona and [referred to [China]{.mark} being [in a "rapid
boil]{.mark},"]{.underline} according to The Washington Times.

"[You know the metaphor]{.underline} of boiling the frog. Well, it's a
rapid boil. [We notice quick change]{.underline}," Paparo said.

In April, China conducted two days of war games to practice various
military maneuvers around Taiwan. The Chinese Communist Party has
repeatedly warned Taipei against seeking full independence from China.

The Times reports that in 2021, China "held a single brigade exercise
near Taiwan and followed it with a six-brigade drill in 2022 and a
42-brigade exercise in 2024."

[[While China]{.mark} has [increased military
drills]{.mark}]{.underline} and warnings to Taiwan, Heritage Foundation
China research fellow Michael Cunningham argues that [[war]{.mark}
between China and Taiwan]{.underline} [is **[very
unlikely.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"**[[No, China won't invade]{.mark} Taiwan]{.underline}**," Cunningham
told The Daily Signal.

"The [[prospect of war]{.mark} over Taiwan [is even **scarier for
Beijing**]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it is for
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the [[only
scenarios]{.underline}]{.mark} I can imagine in which China would attack
Taiwan would be [[if Taiwan declared]{.mark} formal
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline}---which [Taiwan's [constitution
makes]{.mark} **virtually [impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or if the
U.S. established diplomatic relations or signed a formal defense treaty
with Taiwan," the Heritage expert said.

If Taiwan did declare independence from China, or if the U.S.
established formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, such an action would
likely "trigger" a military response from China and "lead \[Chinese
leader\] Xi Jinping to conclude that he must act to preserve his
legitimacy as China's leader," Cunningham said.

But [apart from such developments]{.underline}, the policy expert says,
"[[China's leaders can't afford to]{.mark} attempt to [take
Taiwan]{.mark} by force]{.underline} unless they're convinced they can
win at a politically acceptable cost, and [Xi]{.underline} [and the rest
of the leadership]{.underline} [don't believe there is a path for such a
low-risk victory."]{.underline}

Even if China succeeded in an invasion of Taiwan, such a conflict would
create "social and economic havoc" in China, Cunningham said, adding
that a [[conflict]{.mark} could even **[jeopardize the CCP's
control]{.mark}** of China]{.underline}.

The reason [China]{.underline} is [using intimidation tactics and
increasing military exercises]{.underline} around Taiwan is part of a
strategy [to "wear down America's support for the island]{.underline}
and divide Taiwan's own population so that it can eventually take the
island without a major military operation," he explained.

The "strategy appears to be working," he added.

"The [more convinced Americans become that a Chinese attack]{.underline}
on Taiwan [isn't a matter of if but whe]{.underline}n, the [more worried
people become that continued support for Taiwan will get us dragged into
a war]{.underline} with China," Cunningham said.

If the U.S. decides it is not in its interest to defend Taiwan, "China
may be able to coerce Taiwan into negotiating unification without a
major fight, which would have devastating effects on U.S. national
security," he said.

Cunningham warns that "while the U.S. government must do all it can to
ensure China doesn't catch up with the U.S. militarily, we have to be
careful how we talk about this in our public discourse to avoid playing
right into Beijing's hand."

Jiyoung **Ko 18,** Postdoctoral Fellow, The Notre Dame International
Security Center, 1-22-2018, "Popular Nationalism and International
Conflict,"
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6496/2fb3f44843bbeec00b82bbfad2c57719d0b9.pdf

What is the effect of popular nationalism on the initiation of
international conflict? [[Contrary to]{.mark} the [conventional
wisdom]{.mark} that nationalism triggers interstate violence, building
upon the microfoundation of nationalistic sentiments and foreign policy
preferences, I claim that [whether]{.mark} popular [nationalism
increases]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} international
[conflict]{.mark} or not [hinges on a country's chance of total victory
in conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline} A nationalistic public displays a
strong aversion to compromise and prefers complete success in foreign
policy, which increases the costs of failed conflict and a chance to pay
such costs. [As such, [if total victory]{.mark} in conflict [is a
distant possibility**, leaders are unlikely to initiate
military**]{.mark} **[ventures in front of a nationalistic
public,]{.mark} and [popular nationalism is more likely to open the door
for the s]{.mark}tatus [quo.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [A survey experiment
and a [case study on China's]{.mark} and Taiwan's [responses to a
territorial crisis show]{.mark}]{.underline} [that the effect of
[popular]{.mark}]{.underline} [[nationalism is]{.mark} **indeed
[conditional]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the chance of total victory. The
theory and findings in this paper have several important implications
for the study of conflict. First, while previous studies on domestic
politics and conflict tend to characterize domestic audiences as either
hawks or doves, this paper suggests that there is another type of
domestic audiences: a nationalistic public. With two distinct foreign
policy preferences, the nationalistic public can shape a state's foreign
policy behavior in a unique way. Second, the monadic theoretical
framework discussed in the paper has some implications for the
bargaining theory. A nationalistic public's preference for complete
success generates an exante expectation of bargaining failure, as it
drastically shrinks the bargaining range of acceptable agreements. [As
such, [unless leaders are very confident]{.mark} that they can achieve
total victory in conflict ensued by bargaining failure]{.underline},
[**[they are unlikely to enter into bargaining in the first
place]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [In other words, the theory proposed here
offers an explanation for why states may want to avoid bargaining in the
first place when leaders have a nationalistic public at
home.]{.underline} [It also suggests that, contrary to the conventional
wisdom, [when both states have a nationalistic public
at]{.mark}]{.underline} [[home**, there could be a greater chance of the
continuation of**]{.mark} **the status quo and
[peace]{.mark}.**]{.underline} 30 [Third, the theoretical framework
offers one obvious answer to the question of under what conditions
leaders would be more likely to stoke nationalistic sentiments for the
sake of conflict: they are more likely to do so when they anticipate
total victory in conflict]{.underline}. Once nationalistic sentiments
are intentionally stirred, leaders have to face the consequences, such
as paying high domestic political costs of failed conflict. Knowing this
ex-ante, leaders may attempt to imbue nationalistic sentiments and
manufacture popular nationalism only when they believe that they can win
a conflict that they are going to launch with a decisive victory. Future
studies can endogenize leaders' manipulation of nationalism and
empirically test this proposition. This paper has more than academic
implications. The theory and findings in this paper offer important
insights regarding rising China and the direction of U.S. foreign policy
in Asia. [They suggest that as long as Chinese leaders believe that they
cannot achieve total victory in conflict]{.underline}, [**[popular
nationalism in China is unlikely to descend into a militarized
conflict]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [This is [particularly so, as
the]{.mark} Chinese [government can]{.mark} easily [reduce its costs of
inaction through its media censorship and hard
repression]{.mark}]{.underline}. To prevent popular nationalism in China
from creating a momentum for military aggression, the United States
should send a clear signal to China that total victory is unattainable
if conflict arises over Taiwan or in the East and South China Seas. In
addition, the theory and findings in this paper suggest that popular
nationalism can be most dangerous if it becomes intense or suddenly on
the rise in the United States. With the country's military supremacy,
American leaders are much more likely to be optimistic about their
chance of total victory in conflict, which is likely to embolden them in
front of a nationalistic public.

But [[neither]{.mark} side seems to [have much]{.mark} to offer [other
than **peaceful coexistence**]{.mark}. If both sides develop normally,
in terms of power, the future of the South China Sea would
be]{.underline} a **[bipolar]{.underline}** region, [regardless
what]{.underline} kind of [intentions]{.underline} they have. Moreover,
[most countries]{.underline} in the region [are reluctant to take
sides]{.underline} in the China-U.S. power competition. [Therefore, it
is hard for either side to re-establish a dominant order
here]{.underline}.

As the power distribution becomes more balanced, [the idea of a managed
military [conflict is **fanciful**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One side's
provocation will inevitably invite the other's retaliation, where spiral
escalation is highly possible. [[Considering]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[both]{.underline}]{.mark} sides [have]{.underline} so many [weapon
platforms and]{.underline} both [[are]{.mark} major **[nuclear]{.mark}**
powers, the [feasibility]{.mark} of a military solution has **[greatly
diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The China-U.S. [rivalry in]{.mark} the **[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea
[[is]{.mark} certainly [growing, but **war is**]{.mark} **still [some

[encounters]{.mark} between the two sides **[every day]{.mark}**, and
**thousands every year**. [Most]{.mark} of them are [**professional**
and **safe**]{.mark}; only a few have involved some risks. The recent
pandemic has]{.underline} made both countries and militaries more
sensitive, which, to some extent, has [heightened]{.underline} the
[tension]{.underline} of the situation.

Because of COVID-19, China and the United States are more concerned and
anxious about each other. In addition to maintaining daily operations in
the western Pacific, both sides have some new worries. The United States
is concerned that China would take advantage of the temporary power
vacuum; thus it has deliberately shown more force and given China more
diplomatic pressure. China feels that Washington's South China Sea
policy is increasingly desperate to the point that, even during the
pandemic, the United States has not forgotten to provoke China. Beijing
is also convinced that the U.S., motivated by power competition, is
focusing on China's activities and ignoring the actions of other
claimants.

[From mid-April to early May, the U.S. Navy dispatched several
warships]{.underline}, including USS America LHA-6, to the so-called
standoff area between the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the West Capella to deter
China's operations. The PLA Navy was believed to have a similar number
of warships there at the same time, which aroused heated discussion
among the media and experts. Another less publicized but more intense
case was the reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance of China's
aircraft carrier Liaoning formation when it was conducting open sea
cross-region mobile training while followed by American warships and
multiple military aircraft. An anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that
the confrontation was so intense that one U.S. warship even once came
within 100 meters of the Chinese carrier.

[Even so, [both sides]{.mark} have [remained]{.mark} largely
**professional** and **[restrained]{.mark}**. In fact,
**[neither]{.mark}** the Chinese military nor the American military has
**[increased]{.mark}** its [activity]{.mark} significantly [compared

[**[The]{.mark}**re is a venerable **[arg]{.mark}**ument [that

[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[major conflict]{.mark} that neither

**[escalate]{.underline}**. [Nevertheless, **[history
shows]{.mark}**]{.underline} that **[big wars [don\'t]{.mark} just
[happen]{.mark} inadvertently]{.underline}**. 

The accidental war thesis was raised recently by former Prime Minister
Kevin Rudd of Australia. [Noting the many flashpoints at which U.S. and
Chinese interests collide, he argued that there is a growing danger of
them "**stumbling** into conflict."]{.underline} An accidental collision
between ships or planes in the South China Sea, or several other
plausible scenarios, could lead to crisis, escalation and war. [Just as
the great powers of the early 20th century "**sleep-walked**" into World
War I, China and America could **blunder** their way to disaster
**today**. ]{.underline}

[World War I is often considered the classic example of an unwanted
war]{.underline}: a devastating conflict that none of the participants
would have chosen had they known what was coming. During the Cold War,
U.S. policymakers worried that crises over Berlin or Cuba could get out
of control. There is a body of political science literature devoted to
understanding how accidental war can occur.

[Yet]{.underline} there is one big problem: [[It is **hard to
identify**]{.mark} **any [major wars that came]{.mark} about [even
though no one wanted them]{.mark}**. The trouble [in]{.mark} July and
August [**1914**, it]{.mark} turns out, [was **not**]{.mark} that
**[inflexible]{.mark} mobilization**]{.underline} schedules
[and]{.underline} **[military [plans]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[thrust]{.underline}** political [leaders into conflict. It was that
**several powers**]{.underline}, most notably but not solely
Austria-Hungary and Imperial Germany, [[insisted]{.mark} on pursuing
**[aggressive policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [they **knew**
**risked**]{.mark}]{.underline} a localized war at best and a
**[continental [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** at worst. [They nearly
**all believed**, moreover, that if war had to come, **better** it
should come **sooner** rather than **later**.]{.underline}

A generation after that, [Franklin Roosevelt may not have foreseen that
slapping an oil embargo on Japan would lead to the aerial assault on
Pearl Harbor. But he certainly understood that war was a distinct
**possibility**]{.underline} [once the U.S. began **strangling** the
economy of a country that was already pillaging Asia.]{.underline}

[Likewise, the **Six Day sWar**]{.underline} of 1967 [is
sometimes treated as]{.underline} an **[inadvertent]{.underline}**
conflict. [But again, Egyptian leaders were **hardly blind** to
the danger of war when they mobilized forces in the Sinai Peninsula,
blockaded Israel's port on the Red Sea and took other belligerent
steps. ]{.underline}

The reality, as the historian Marc Trachtenberg has shown, is that
[countries tend to **avoid** war when neither really desires it. Yes,
leaders do sometimes **misjudge**]{.underline} how wars will turn out
and how destructive they will be. [Tensions can gradually ratchet up in
a way that makes de-escalation progressively **harder**.]{.underline}

[Yet [there is **no more monumental decision than**]{.mark} **to
initiate a [major conflict]{.mark}**[. So when countries
**really**]{.mark} **do [want]{.mark}** [to avert]{.mark} a
[showdown]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are generally willing to [**tack** or
**retreat**]{.mark}, even at the cost of some
**embarrassment**. ]{.underline}

[[During the Cold War]{.mark}, there was **plenty of superpower
brinkmanship**]{.underline}, and some hair-raising incidents involving
U.S. and Soviet military forces. There were several near misses in the
Cuban Missile Crisis alone. [But]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[that]{.underline}** case [and]{.underline} **[[every]{.mark} other
[case]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [the [crisis was
**defused**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and the superpowers **drew back**,
precisely]{.underline} **[because]{.underline}** [they didn't believe
that the stakes merited a nuclear bloodbath.]{.underline}

[Accidental war also **seems unlikely today**]{.underline}. [There are
plenty of circumstances in which [the U.S. and China could find
themselves in]{.mark} a crisis:]{.underline} a replay of the EP-3
incident of 2001, when a midair collision led to a diplomatic standoff;

Tensions between China and the Philippines have escalated dramatically
in recent months around Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef in the
eastern Spratly Islands. The Chinese Coast Guard has repeatedly
attempted to block delivery of food, water, and building supplies to the
Philippine marine detachment aboard the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War
II--era warship grounded on the shoal since 1999. In at least two
incidents since March, China's use of coercion has injured Philippines
sailors. The risks of escalation are serious. The United States has said
its defense obligations under the Mutual Defense Treaty extend "to armed
attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft ---
including those of its Coast Guard --- anywhere in the South China Sea."

But [[while China has been escalating with the Philippines at
unprecedented levels]{.underline}]{.mark} around Second Thomas Shoal,
[[it has exercised striking restraint toward Vietnam's far larger and
more militarized expansion of its South China Sea
outposts]{.underline}.]{.mark} There is no record of China using
paramilitary or military forces to disrupt Vietnam's land reclamation in
the Spratly Islands. As Zack Cooper and Greg Poling have recently noted,
[[China's assertiveness toward the Philippines and restraint toward
Vietnam is especially puzzling given that the former is a U.S. treaty
ally while the latter is not. Alliances with great powers are supposed
to deter aggression, not to invite it]{.underline}.]{.mark} This is a
puzzle that warrants scrutiny not just to help illuminate the nature of
Chinese strategy in one of the world's leading flashpoints. Deciphering
the logic behind China's conduct also has direct implications for how
the United States and its allies can best defend their interests in the
South China Sea and beyond.

[[There are a number of potential explanations for China's
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. Below I describe five possibilities, each
of which is derived from a more general explanation of China's conduct
in the South China Sea. Although several capture important elements of
Chinese strategy, none are able to satisfyingly explain the variation in
Beijing's conduct highlighted above. So, I offer an alternative
explanation, one rooted in how Chinese leaders conceptualize the South
China Sea disputes and the dilemmas they present. Beijing's conduct
toward the Philippines and Vietnam differs because Manila and Hanoi have
different capacities to impose strategic costs on Beijing. Relative to
the Philippines, Vietnam has a greater ability to impose such costs on
China. Paradoxically, Manila's alliance with Washington circumscribes
its capacity to impose such costs, while Vietnam's nonaligned status
increases its ability to do so.

Five Possibilities

The [[first]{.underline}]{.mark} explanation focuses [[on **China's
interest in preventing its rivals from taking collective action against
it**. This so-called "divide and rule" strategy holds that Beijing uses
combinations of carrots and sticks to drive wedges between its rival
claimants to doom any prospect for collective action among
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. From such a perspective, [[Chinese restraint
toward Vietnam could be a function of its ongoing standoff with
Manila]{.underline}]{.mark} at Second Thomas Shoal and [[meant to avoid
creating another crisis with another rival at the same
time.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While Beijing certainly has an interest in preventing or forestalling
the emergence of collective resistance among its rivals, this is an
unsatisfying explanation. Chinese coercion around the BRP Sierra Madre
began over 10 years ago, and since then it has regularly escalated
concurrently with Vietnam (and its other South China Sea rivals). More
to the point, even if concern about pushing Manila and Hanoi into a
united front contributed to Beijing's restraint toward the latter, this
explanation is unable to tell us why Beijing elected to continue to
contest Philippine consolidation instead of challenging Vietnamese land
reclamation while exercising restraint toward Manila --- a policy
combination with presumably the same effect.

The [[second]{.underline}]{.mark} explanation focuses [[on **China's
interest in remaining in the "gray zone" and avoiding war in the South
China Sea**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing, of course, has gone to
lengths to advance its South China Sea claims while avoiding armed
conflict. From this perspective, variation in Beijing's responses to
Philippine and Vietnamese consolidation could be explained with
reference to their respective propensity for escalation. [[While Vietnam
has a demonstrated history of resisting Chinese predations, Manila does
not. Chinese analysts attribute Manila's restraint in large part to
Washington's unwillingness to allow its ally to run risks of the kind
likely to trigger its mutual defense commitments. The United States,
Chinese analysts argue, seeks to "intervene but not become entrapped" in
the South China Sea disputes.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While this explanation, too, captures an important element of Chinese
strategy, it obfuscates deeper drivers of it. Most obviously, it begs
the follow-on questions: Why is Beijing so keen to stay in the gray
zone, and why would it be so concerned with the possibility of
Vietnamese escalation? China has used military force in the South China
Sea before, including in the post-Mao era, and it did so by targeting
Hanoi. In a conflict today, China would quickly dispatch with Vietnamese
resistance, as it did in 1974 in the Paracels and in 1988 in the western
Spratly Islands. As argued below, it is not the risk of escalation
itself --- or even the possibility of war with Hanoi --- that has
produced restraint in Beijing. Rather, it is the potential second-order
consequences of such a conflict.

A third explanation focuses on the close political relationship between
China and Vietnam. Although distrustful of each other, both states are
run by communist parties that have much in common. They are united in
their collective resolve to preserve their party's monopoly on political
power and both are acutely threatened by Washington's promotion of
democracy and human rights. They are also determined not to allow their
bilateral relationship to deteriorate as it did in the late 1970s, and
they have built an unparalleled network of government and party ties to
help buttress it. From this perspective, Chinese restraint toward
Vietnam's land reclamation may reflect its interests in maintaining
healthy ties with Hanoi. Beijing may be particularly inclined to soft
peddle the disputes now, as the country's conservative new president
seems likely to be especially deferential to Beijing.

While China's relationship with Hanoi is unique among its South China
Sea rivals, close political bonds between the two can --- and often have
--- cut the other way. Confident that its political ties with Hanoi will
enable it to manage escalation and avoid incurring major costs, China
has regularly escalated with Vietnam in the South China Sea and done so
increasingly over the last 20 years. This explanation sheds little light
on why Beijing has exercised such restraint when confronted with the
large-scale expansion and fortification of Vietnam's South China Sea
outposts.

A [[fourth]{.underline}]{.mark} explanation centers [[around **China's
perception of threat associated with the U.S.--Philippine
alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since the late-1990s, [[Chinese leaders
have believed that the United States is using its alliances as anchors
of an anti-China coalition aiming to thwart Beijing's rise. This
view]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[has grown in recent
years]{.underline}]{.mark}. Chinese analysts and state-controlled media
regularly suggest that Washington uses the Philippines' and Japan's
offshore disputes with China to advance its hostile strategic intentions
toward Beijing. [[From this perspective, Manila's alliance with
Washington may make its conduct in the South China Sea more threatening
for Beijing than that of nonaligned Vietnam.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To be sure, Chinese leaders perceive this alliance to be threatening.
This cannot, however, explain China's variable approach to Philippine
and Vietnamese efforts to consolidate their South China Sea occupations.
Most basically, it stretches credulity to suggest that the Philippine
presence on a decaying ship is especially threatening. However, even
accepting the premise that China's conduct is driven by fear of the
U.S.--Philippine alliance, Beijing would not focus its coercive efforts
on the most vulnerable of Manila's outposts. It would focus instead of
one of Manila's eight larger occupations, some of which have been
expanded in recent years and all of which would have greater military
utility. Furthermore, to whatever degree Washington benefits from the
South China Sea disputes, it seems clear that the Philippine presence on
Second Thomas Shoal is on balance a liability --- not an asset --- for
it. As Chinese analysts correctly note, the United States does not want
to be dragged into an armed conflict in the South China Sea, and
especially not one over a submerged reef that does not even have the
legal status of a rock.

A [[fifth]{.underline}]{.mark}, and related, potential explanation also
[[centers around the U.S.--Philippine alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} but
for different reasons. [[Because Beijing views the alliance in
threatening terms, some analysts suggest that **Beijing coerces Manila
in the South China Sea to drive a wedge into the U.S.--Philippine
relationship**]{.underline}. [Chinese pressure around Second Thomas
Shoal]{.underline}]{.mark}, the thinking goes, [[will expose and
exacerbate cleavages between Washington and Manila, undermining the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. China scholar Robert Ross has recently
put forward just such an argument, suggesting that Beijing targets
Manila not simply because it is a more menacing rival but because it is
a more enticing target. [[Vietnam's lack of an alliance with the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[means that coercing it
carries less strategic upside.]{.underline}]{.mark}

This argument is intuitively appealing but there does not seem to be any
evidence supporting it. Of course Beijing would be pleased to weaken the
U.S.--Philippine alliance, but its conduct in the South China Sea is not
designed to do so. Over the last 30 years, Beijing has watched as its
assertiveness toward the Philippines has time and again strengthened ---
not weakened --- the alliance. Even when it had opportunities to weaken
the alliance, as it did under the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, its
coercive conduct in the South China Sea ensured that it would be unable
to do so. If it were interested in using the disputes to undermine the
alliance, it would have changed course.

As noted below, [[the existence of the U.S.--Philippine alliance --- and
the lack of an American alliance with Vietnam --- are key factors
shaping China's approach to each]{.underline}]{.mark}. This has nothing
to do, however, with Beijing viewing Philippine behavior as especially
threatening or with it pursing a wedging campaign. Rather, the existence
of the U.S.--Philippine alliance has counter-intuitively circumscribed
Manila's capacity to impose strategic costs on Beijing. This is a
limitation that Vietnam does not have.

Weiquan and WeiwenSince at least 2011, Chinese leaders have framed
Beijing's policy in the South China Sea as one aiming to "harmonize" a
tension (or, in their view, a dialectic) between weiquan (维权) and
weiwen (维稳). Weiquan refers to Beijing's interest in defending and
advancing its offshore claims. Weiwen refers its interests in
maintaining stability and, more broadly, maintaining a favorable
regional security environment conducive to its rise. A congenial
regional security environment has required preserving friendly ties with
its Southeast Asian rivals and avoiding pushing them into what Beijing
views as a hostile U.S.-led coalition bent on thwarting its rise.China's
maritime and territorial interests (weiquan) are at tension with its
broader strategic interest in maintaining a favorable external
environment (weiwen). To the extent it advances its South China Sea
claims, it risks destabilizing the region, alienating its Southeast
Asian rivals, and pushing them closer to Washington. However, just as
China's rival claimants have different capacities to impose territorial
costs on it by damaging weiquan, so too do they have different
capacities to impose strategic costs on it by damaging weiwen. Because
of this, the same escalatory conduct directed at different rivals can
involve different degrees of strategic risk. China is more likely to
escalate with a rival when it has less capacity to impose strategic
costs on Beijing; it is more likely to exercise restraint with rivals
that have a greater capacity to impose strategic costs.The capacity of a
rival to impose strategic costs on Beijing is largely a function of the
extent to which it is already imposing costs on it. The more costs that
a rival imposes, the less capacity it has to impose additional costs in
the future. There are a number of ways in which rivals can impose
strategic costs. They can, for example, impose reputational costs,
publicly casting Beijing as a threatening state and propagating an
alarming narrative about it across the region. They can impose political
or economic penalties on Beijing, damaging the bilateral relationship,
and they can forcibly resist China's advances, escalating the conflict
and destabilizing the region. Lastly, and of particular importance for
the Philippines and Vietnam, a rival can tighten strategic ties with a
hostile great power --- such as the United States in the post-Cold War
era --- imposing "balancing costs" on Beijing.A rival that regularly
imposes reputational costs on China will have less capacity to impose
such costs in the future, a rival already aligned with a hostile great
power has less capacity to impose "balancing costs." A nonaligned state
retains the possibility of forming a new formal or informal alliance
with the great power, which would constitute a major change in the
status quo and a major cost on Beijing. A rival in an existing alliance
can upgrade the relationship, but this will often be a marginal change,
imposing a marginal cost. Beijing thus has less to lose escalating with
a rival claimant already aligned with a hostile great power.In the
1980s, for example, Sino--Vietnamese hostility and Vietnam's alliance
with the Soviet Union, a Chinese adversary, made Hanoi less able to
impose strategic costs on Beijing. China's late-Cold War efforts to
advance in the South China Sea thus disproportionately targeted Hanoi,
most obviously in its decision to occupy six features along the western
edge of the Spratly Islands, many of which were just adjacent to
existing Vietnamese outposts. Beijing was, furthermore, willing to risk
armed conflict with Hanoi in 1988 because it was confident that, just as
Moscow refrained from intervening during the 1979 Sino--Vietnamese
border war, it would not intervene on Hanoi's behalf in a South China
Sea conflict.Contemporary ConditionsToday, the situation is different,
but the same logic applies. As long as frictions remain in the gray zone
--- and the United States does not intervene militarily --- the
Philippines has less capacity than Vietnam to impose strategic costs on
China. Beijing has less to lose in escalating with Manila so it can
afford to be more assertive; it has more to lose in escalating with
Hanoi, so it must be more restrained.The Philippines imposes more
reputational costs on China than any other rival. Manila recently
escorted journalists to Second Thomas Shoal to observe and publicize
China's coercive conduct, a practice it has occasionally used since the
mid-1990s. Even during the tenure of former Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte, who was often personally obsequious to Beijing, his
administration regularly publicized and impugned Chinese actions in the
South China Sea, contributing to a schizophrenic foreign policy that
failed to meaningfully deter China. In contrast, Vietnam is more
circumspect and has thus retained a greater capacity to impose such
costs on Beijing in the future.More importantly, because Manila is
already a close U.S. ally, it lacks the ability to impose meaningful
balancing costs. It can further tighten the alliance, but this marginal
cost is one that Beijing has been consistently willing to incur.
Vietnam's nonaligned status, however, gives it the possibility of
forming a formal or informal alliance with the United States --- that
is, the possibility of imposing a major strategic cost on Beijing that
would negatively transform its security environment. Further, Vietnam is
a continental neighbor sharing a 1,350-kilometer land border with China,
and it has one of --- if not the most --- formidable militaries in
Southeast Asia. Its addition to a U.S.-led coalition would seriously
damage China's interests in weiwen. The Philippines, by contrast, is
across the sea, possesses an anemic military, and is already (from
China's perspective) a member of the U.S.-led anti-China coalition.The
disparity in the strategic risks Vietnam and the Philippines pose is
particularly stark in terms of Beijing contesting their efforts to
consolidate and expand their outposts. Beijing has good reason to
believe that escalation around Second Thomas can be controlled --- and
the United States kept out --- because it has been successfully doing so
since 2013. It has also harassed Philippine vessels around its other
South China Sea occupations with little in terms of costs incurred. If,
on the other hand, Beijing endeavored to thwart Vietnam's land
reclamation, Hanoi would likely perceive such an effort as imperiling
its hold on the feature themselves, the anchors of its South China Sea
claims, and the likelihood of Vietnamese resistance and escalation would
be high. It would be under these condition that Hanoi would be most
likely to impose on China the most serious kinds of strategic costs
available to it.ImplicationsThis analysis has several important
implications for deterring Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and
beyond that are relevant both to the United States and Beijing's
territorial rivals. First, to bolster deterrence for the Philippines at
Second Thomas Shoal and elsewhere in the South China Sea, Manila and
Washington need to undermine China's confidence that it can comfortably
stay in the gray zone. Without the prospect of spiraling escalation and
U.S. intervention, China will believe it continue to coerce the
Philippines and apply pressure on its territorial occupations at minimal
strategic cost. A greater U.S. military presence around Second Thomas
Shoal, including assistance resupplying the BSP Sierra Madre, would
likely help undermine China's confidence in this regard.Second, for
China's Southeast Asian rivals, this analysis suggests that costs
credibly threatened are often more effective deterrents than costs
actually imposed. For years, American analysts have argued that ASEAN
states must impose costs on Beijing to counter and deter its assertive
conduct in the South China Sea. This analysis, however, suggests that as
more costs are imposed, Beijing has less to lose in escalating further.
Manila, and its fellow Southeast Asian claimants, should be more
deliberate about imposing costs on Beijing. Imposing reputational costs,
for example, may be effective to help bolster the credibility of more
serious threats, but by themselves such costs do little good and may be
counterproductive. Southeast Asian states need to better husband their
capacity for imposing costs and place more emphasis on maximizing their
latent capacity to do so.Third, the distinction between costs threatened
and costs imposed should help to inform U.S. partnership-building
efforts in Southeast Asia, a priority of the U.S. National Security
Strategy. While deepening regional security partnerships is often
regarded as an unalloyed good in which more is better, this analysis
paints a more nuanced picture. Tightening such partnerships too deeply
and too quickly could weaken deterrence by diluting the costs that
Southeast Asian states could later threaten to impose on China.
Southeast Asian states --- and regional stability --- may benefit most
by deepening security partnership slowly and incrementally.Fourth,
although small and middle-sized states seek alliances with great powers
to enhance their security and deter foreign aggression, at low levels of
escalation they may have the opposite effect. The Philippines' alliance
with the U.S. has undermined its ability to deter Chinese coercion and
territorial aggrandizement, while Vietnam's nonaligned status enables it
to impose the full range of strategic costs on Beijing. In a world
increasingly characterized by gray zone competition, policymakers and
planners need to formulate creative ways of bolstering deterrence at low
levels of escalation without reflexively resorting to cost imposition.
Scholars meanwhile need to address this empirical anomaly, which
challenges conventional wisdom on the relationship between alliance
formation and deterrence.

Lastly, the tension between weiwen and weiquan likely has implications
beyond the South China Sea and for China's other territorial disputes.
[[**The dilemma illuminates how Beijing thinks about pursuing its
revisionist territorial ambitions,** including what facilitates and what
restrains its pursuit of them]{.underline}]{.mark}. Analysts of Chinese
territorial dispute strategy --- and its foreign policy more generally
--- are best positioned to understand their subject when they approach
it using the same concepts as Chinese leaders themselves.

A [new wave of **[purges]{.mark}** has [engulfed]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [**senior leadership** of]{.underline} China's military, [the
**[P]{.mark}**eople's **[L]{.mark}**iberation
**[A]{.mark}**rmy]{.underline}. Since the 20th National Party Congress
in October 2022, [[more than 20]{.mark} senior **PLA [officers]{.mark}**
from all **four** services]{.underline}---the army, navy, air force, and
rocket force---[have [**disappeared** from public view
or]{.mark}]{.underline} been [**[removed]{.mark}** from their
posts]{.underline}. The absences of other generals have also been
reported, which could [**foreshadow** additional purges]{.underline}.

Most notably, since the fall of 2023, three of the six uniformed members
of the party's [**C**entral **M**ilitary **C**ommission]{.underline},
[the **top body**]{.underline} of the Chinese Communist Party charged
with [**overseeing** the armed forces]{.underline}, [have been
removed]{.underline} from their posts. The first to fall was **[[Defense
Minister]{.underline}]{.mark}** Li Shangfu, who was removed in October
2023 and [[**expelled** from the **CCP**]{.underline}]{.mark} in June
2024. Then, this past November, Miao Hua, the [[**director** of]{.mark}
the CMC's [Political Work]{.mark} Department]{.underline}, [which
manages personnel and party affairs]{.underline}, was
[**[suspended]{.mark}** for]{.underline} "serious [violations of
**discipline**]{.underline}" before being formally removed from the CMC
last month. And most recently, the Financial Times reported that He
Weidong, the [second-ranked **[vice chair]{.mark}**]{.underline} who has
not appeared in public since early March, [had been
**[purged]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[**Never** before has half the **CMC** been dismissed]{.mark} in such a
**short period**]{.underline}. Even stranger is the fact that [[all
three]{.mark} generals had previously [been **promoted**
by]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese leader [**[Xi]{.mark}**
Jinping]{.underline}; they were appointed to the CMC itself in 2022,
after Xi consolidated his control over the party at the 20th Party
Congress. [He]{.underline} Weidong [was [even a member of]{.mark} the
**Politburo**]{.underline}, one of [[the party's **top**]{.mark}
decision-making [bodies]{.mark}]{.underline}, comprised of the 24
highest-ranking party leaders. And [Miao and He have been
described]{.underline} by analysts [as being part of a]{.underline}
"[**Fujian** faction]{.underline}" [within the **PLA**]{.underline},
because [the **generals**]{.underline} had been stationed in that
province at the same time as Xi and [are [believed to have **close
ties**]{.mark}]{.underline} [with him]{.underline}.

The fact that these high-profile purges are occurring now is not lost on
outside observers. In **[2027]{.underline}**, the PLA will celebrate the
100th anniversary of its founding. It is also the year by which [**Xi**
expects China's armed forces to have made **significant** strides in
their **mod**ernization]{.underline}. Finally, the year is noteworthy
because, according to former CIA Director Bill Burns, Xi has
[**instructed** the PLA to be]{.underline} "[ready by **2027** to
conduct a successful **invasion**]{.underline}" [of
**Taiwan**]{.underline}. Xi's instructions do not indicate that China
will in fact invade Taiwan that year, but, as Burns put it, they serve
as "a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition."

With such ambitious goals set for the PLA, the question then arises as
to how this [new wave of **[purges]{.mark}**]{.underline} could
[[affect]{.mark} the PLA's **[readiness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[purges]{.underline} themselves [are [likely to **slow**]{.mark} some
**[weapons mod]{.mark}**ernization]{.underline} programs, [[disrupt
**command** structures and **decision-making**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and weaken **morale**]{.underline}---all of which would [**degrade**
the PLA's ability to **fight**]{.underline} in the near to medium term.
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** may [now be [forced to exercise
greater **caution** before]{.mark} pursuing]{.underline} large-scale
[military **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as an
amphibious assault on Taiwan, [even as]{.underline} the [PLA continues
to **pressure** Taiwan with aerial]{.underline} activity [and naval
**patrols**]{.underline} around the island.

Nevertheless, it is useful to remember that Beijing has rarely waited
for the right conditions before ordering the PLA into battle. In 1950,
for instance, Chinese forces intervened in support of Pyongyang in the
Korean War, even though China's economy and society had been devastated
by years of civil war. In 1962, the PLA attacked India, even though
China's most senior military officer had recently been purged for
questioning Mao Zedong's disastrous Great Leap Forward. And in 1979,
Beijing dispatched an ill-prepared PLA to Vietnam, where Chinese troops
suffered significant losses for limited political gains. Now, as then,
Chinese leaders may pursue war even if the domestic economic and
political conditions appear unfavorable---and even if the PLA is not
ready to fight.

CASTAWAYS

For outside observers, it is notoriously difficult to gather detailed
information and analyze the ongoing purges in China. The CCP rarely
announces them, and even when they are publicized, the charges leading
to dismissal are often vaguely described only as violations of
discipline. Charges announced publicly may also not reflect the true
underlying reason for an official's removal from office. Still, there
are several likely reasons that Li, Miao, He, and other senior officers
were purged.

First, a [**common** reason for]{.underline} many [purges is
graft]{.underline}. **[[Corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [long
plagued the PLA]{.underline} and the CCP more broadly. Since Xi came to
power in 2012, Beijing has more than doubled its defense budget in order
to fund the military's rapid modernization. This flood of new money,
especially related to weapons procurement and construction projects, has
increased opportunities for officers and defense industry executives to
pad their budgets or skim money off the top. Before becoming defense
minister, Li had been in charge of the CMC's weapons development
department, which oversees the procurement process. A few [months before
Li's **dismissal**]{.underline}, [both]{.underline} the [commander and
commissar of the PLA **Rocket Force**,]{.underline} and two of the
commissar's deputies, [were all **detained**]{.underline}. The PLARF's
rapid expansion on Li's watch, including the construction of more than
300 silos and the significant expansion of its ballistic missile
arsenal, likely offered many opportunities for self-enrichment.

Some [generals]{.underline} may [also have been **purged**
because]{.underline} they were [engaging in
**[bribery]{.mark}**]{.underline} [related to promotions]{.underline}
and patronage networks. This has been a long-standing problem for the
PLA: [often]{.underline}, the most [**well-connected**
officers]{.underline}, rather than the most competent ones, [are
**promoted**]{.underline} to higher ranks. Miao, the head of the
Political Work Department, oversaw personnel and appointments. If the
promotions he signed off on were not strictly merit-based, it may have
contributed to his undoing. Miao's predecessor, Zhang Yang, was placed
under investigation in 2017 for similar reasons. Less than two months
later, he died by suicide, and the following year, he was posthumously
expelled from the party.

CMC members and other senior officers may also have been removed if they
were deemed to be using [**personnel appointments** to
create]{.underline} their [own power centers]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} "**[mountaintops]{.underline}**," within the PLA.
Senior [[officers]{.mark} who]{.underline} prioritize the
[**[accru]{.mark}**al of [**personal power** are]{.mark} a [liability
for **Xi**]{.mark}]{.underline} because they create conflicting
loyalties and factional tensions within the armed forces that can harm
operational readiness. Because Miao and He were newly appointed members
of the CMC, they may have sought to strengthen their positions at the
expense of veteran members, such as the first-ranked Vice Chair Zhang
Youxia, a childhood friend of Xi's. Xi has kept Zhang, now 75, on the
CMC despite the normal retirement age of 68.

Finally, it's possible that the purged senior officers committed no
offense at all beyond incompetence: **[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** may
simply [[have been **dissatisfied** with]{.underline}]{.mark} their
**[[performance]{.underline}]{.mark}** and lost confidence [in their
ability to lead]{.underline} and achieve his goals for the PLA. As Joel
Wuthnow and Phillip Saunders observed in their new book, China's Quest
for Military Supremacy, the structure of the relationship between the
party and the armed forces makes it hard for Xi to trust his generals.
The PLA enjoys substantial autonomy with little direct supervision, so
the party must rely on the PLA to discipline itself. Moreover, the
highly specialized nature of modern military affairs means that the
party lacks the expertise to ensure that the PLA is meeting the party's
modernization goals.

Whatever the reasons for the recent **[[purges]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
they [will]{.underline} almost [certainly [**degrade** China's]{.mark}
combat [**readiness** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the Chinese
[[leadership's **confidence**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the PLA's
capabilities. [In order for the **[PLA]{.mark}** to prevail]{.underline}
in potential conflicts on China's periphery, [especially a **war** over
Taiwan]{.underline}, [it [seeks to master **joint
op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which combine elements
from the different services and branches to achieve military objectives.
[The **[complexity]{.mark}** of such **op**eration**s** [requires unity
of **command** and integrated **planning**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
**[[interoperability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of platforms]{.underline}
within and across services, [delegation and

**c**]{.mark}ommand]{.underline}, [**[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline},
[**[c]{.mark}**ommunications]{.underline}, and surveillance systems.
[**Reorganizing** the PLA to]{.underline} better [conduct such
**op**eration**s** was]{.underline} one of the [main reasons Xi
launched]{.underline} unprecedented [organizational
**reforms**]{.underline} in 2015. Now, although **[Xi]{.underline}** has
a number of reasons to avoid taking major military action against
Taiwan, he may also be [**concerned** about how well the **PLA** would
perform]{.underline} so soon [after the **purges**]{.underline}.

[[If]{.mark} the **CCP** uncovered **[corruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the weapons procurement system, for instance, the [[party leadership
may **doubt**]{.mark} the [reliability]{.mark} and performance
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [advanced **[weapons
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} developed and fielded over the past
decade. According to U.S. intelligence, some of [[China's new
**b**]{.mark}allistic **[m]{.mark}**issiles [were filled with
**water**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not fuel, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[blast doors]{.mark}** constructed for **new silos**]{.underline}
[[needed to be]{.underline}]{.mark} repaired or
**[[replaced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Efforts are likely underway to
review and recertify new and planned weapons systems to ensure they will
function as expected, which may slow their development and deployment.

The [purges also disrupt]{.underline} the [functioning of]{.underline}
the entire [command system]{.underline}. The
**[[CMC]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a six-member body that Xi chairs to
[**[oversee]{.mark}** all aspects of the **[PLA]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[has **15** subordinate units]{.underline}. Yet with three of its six
members missing in action, key [[decisions]{.mark} relating to
**op**eration**s**]{.underline}, [planning]{.underline}, [[and **force
dev**]{.mark}elopment]{.underline} [[may be **delayed**]{.mark} until
new]{.underline} permanent [members are **appointed**]{.underline}.
Before joining the CMC, for example, He played a key role in planning
operations in his capacity as head of the [Eastern Theater
Command]{.underline}, whose forces would [play a **central role** in any
operation against **Taiwan**]{.underline}; now the apex of military
decision-making in [[China **lacks** someone with]{.underline}]{.mark}
his [[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Decision-making and command may also be affected in other ways.
[[**Officers** at all levels]{.mark} are likely to
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} much more [**[risk averse]{.mark}** for
fear of making decisions that could]{.underline} later [**ensnare** them
in a purge]{.underline}. The willingness of more junior officers to take
initiative will also suffer, [[reinforcing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[PLA's]{.underline} already strong [tendency toward
**[centralization]{.mark}**]{.underline} in decision-making that
undermines effective joint operations. Officers at all levels will spend
more time engaged in political work and study sessions related to party
ideology and discipline at the expense of their professional military
tasks. Morale may suffer, too, as officers worry who might be next,
[[fueling **distrust**]{.underline}]{.mark} within the officer corps
[[and weakening **cohesion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

## Science Diplomacy

### AT: Diplomacy\-\--Cooperation Fails\-\--1NC

#### Arctic Cooperation [fails]{.underline}\-\--benefits are the [results of domestic objectives]{.underline}, not governance.

Gricius **Gabriella Et al. 22**, PhD candidate specializing in Arctic
politics and institutional governance, 2022, "Can Exceptionalism
Withstand Crises? An Evaluation of the Arctic Council's Response to
Climate Change and Russia's War on Ukraine," Global Studies Quarterly,
Vol. 2, No. 3, pp. 1--6, https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksac042.

In sum, [our study provides further evidence to suggest that the
**[A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [is not]{.mark}, in fact,
[exceptional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Having argued that [even
idealized]{.mark} versions of [institutions]{.mark} [do not]{.mark}
truly [offer]{.mark} unique [ways to withstand crises]{.mark}, we add to
literature which challenges current understandings of how
non-or-intergovernmental institutions respond to crises]{.underline}.
Altogether, this paper suggests there is much more to be considered not
only for the Arctic Council, but also the precariousness of
international institutions considered broadly.

As an endogenous, or internal/goal-driven crisis, our review of existing
Arctic scholarship---notably published prior to Russia's 2022 invasion
of Ukraine---largely indicates that the Council can perhaps contribute
in certain ways (e.g., as a knowledge producer and agenda setter);
however, **[[it does not]{.mark} distinctly [respond to climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Specifically, [evidence suggests that the
[A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil's success [is largely contingent upon
political]{.mark}, environmental, and domestic
[issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. In turn, **[[disputes over]{.mark} the
[prioritization]{.mark} of such issues [and regime changes are hugely
influential in]{.mark} shaping the Council's [ability to respond]{.mark}
to crises]{.underline}**. [Considering climate change is a
long-developing endogenous crisis that is also subject to fast-occurring
exogenous events, **[it appears unlikely]{.mark} that [intergovernmental
organizations]{.mark} such as the Arctic Council [can facilitate]{.mark}
the type of continuous [mitigation]{.mark} efforts** [necessary]{.mark}
to offset the effects of climate change on a substantive
level]{.underline}. [Furthermore, our analysis also indicates that the
[A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [lacks]{.mark} substantive [capacity to
respond to]{.mark} exogenous, or externally driven,
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At the very least, and given previous
geopolitical challenges, our **findings further support the assumption
that [regimes matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Last, our findings also align with research on global environmental
governance, which suggests that [[environmental policy]{.mark}
implementation [is]{.mark} **less the [result of]{.mark} polycentric
governance efforts and agreements and rather the result of [domestic
objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In turn, [one plausible explanation
for the Arctic Council's purported [exceptionalism reflects member
states]{.mark} that have implemented [climate]{.mark} change
[policies]{.mark} that align with---but [are not]{.mark} necessarily the
[result of]{.mark}---[the Council]{.mark} itself]{.underline}.
[[Because]{.mark} the regions, [states]{.mark}, communities, and even
leaders within the organization [seek]{.mark} to achieve their
[own]{.mark} domestic [objectives]{.mark}, **internal [reports]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} likely [biased]{.mark}** [in favor of those policy
positions]{.mark} and goals]{.underline}. [In turn, they may be likely
to over-attribute successes to Council efforts while shifting blame to
other non-council actors]{.underline}.

#### Geoengineering fails. Side-effects, destabilization, scientific consensus prove.

The second trap is to slide into trying to fix the problem with solar
[[geo-engineering]{.underline}]{.mark} -- using technical fixes ranging
from mirrors in space, through artificial volcanoes, to brightening of
marine clouds to try and cool the planet as greenhouse gas
concentrations continue to rise. This is a highly emotive issue, with
many geo-engineering proponents insisting that we have [no option but
to]{.underline} embark on it and that [sceptics]{.underline} (like
myself) are **[[imperilling everyone's future]{.underline}]{.mark}** by
getting in the way.

There are three very well-rehearsed scientific problems with [solar
geo-engineering]{.underline}: reflecting sunlight away does not act as a
simple "anti-greenhouse-gas" -- first, it is, at best, a palliative fix,
with [a [number of **side-effects**]{.mark} that we know
about]{.underline} (and which I can therefore explain) and probably more
that we don't. Proponents argue fiercely that, despite these
side-effects, the alternative of unmitigated warming is much, much worse
-- and while discomforting, that is probably true, so the idea can't be
dismissed out of hand.

The second **[[scientific problem]{.underline}]{.mark}** is the likely
[[duration of]{.mark} any solar geo-engineering
[program]{.mark}]{.underline} large enough to have a significant impact.
A lot of rather [[misleading claims]{.underline}]{.mark} get made
[about]{.underline} how solar [geoengineering]{.underline} is just a
temporary measure [[to "**shave the peak**" off global
temperatures]{.underline}]{.mark}. It isn't. Any climatically
significant geoengineering program would need to be kept in place for
multiple generations. This leads to the [third problem, "termination
shock"]{.underline}: rapid and disruptive [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the [event]{.underline} of a geoengineering **[[program
ending]{.underline}]{.mark}** suddenly because whoever was doing it lost
the will, or the right, to carry on.

These [scientific [challenges]{.mark} with solar
geoengineering]{.underline} tend to [[get]{.underline}]{.mark} most of
the [[attention]{.underline}]{.mark} because the physical climate
science community is fascinated by these kinds of "**[[what
if]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[questions]{.underline}]{.mark}. But I will
argue that the real reason we shouldn't even be contemplating solar
geoengineering are not physical, but human: it would [be **[massively
destabilising]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some institution will need to
implement and control whatever geoengineering technology is deployed --
even if multiple countries contribute, the global geoengineering
programme is ultimately the sum of all their efforts. And that
institution will, inevitably, be held accountable for all the impacts of
the geoengineering programme, real and imaginary.

Proponents of geoengineering recognise this problem, and have come up
with initiatives to "include everyone" (especially developing countries)
in geoengineering governance decisions. The Degrees initiative even
sponsors scientists from developing countries specifically to work on
geoengineering projects, to broaden "buy-in". But to suggest that
developing countries might ever have a real say in [solar geoengineering
[deployment seems **naïve to the point of
dishonesty**]{.mark}]{.underline}: in the end, those with ultimate
control, even if they are not the ones nominally implementing it, will
be national governments with the most advanced space programmes and
military capabilities. Right now, that means China and the USA. It's
possible to imagine others, including India, Russia, Europe, a
[consortium of [developing countries]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} even a wealthy
private [individual]{.mark}]{.underline} (the "Greenfinger" scenario)
[[embarking on]{.mark} a geoengineering [programme]{.mark}]{.underline},
but impossible to imagine them continuing on a climatically significant
scale without the consent of the "G2", or whatever the world's
superpowers happen to be at the time (and, remember, an effective
geoengineering programme would have to last longer than the historical
duration of many superpowers).

What if the [G2 disagree with]{.underline} each other over the "right"
level of [solar geoengineering]{.underline}? Would they come to blows
over it? Again, proponents argue this is a risk worth taking because,
with only two or a handful of rational decision-makers involved, it
should be possible to agree on a level of geoengineering that is
tolerable for everyone and demonstrably better than the alternative of
no geoengineering at all. Perhaps. But the real problem is
**[[not]{.mark} these supposedly-[rational
folks-in-charge]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but everyone else. If one or two
[[superpowers]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[taken control]{.mark} of the
world's weather]{.underline}, someone, somewhere, will blame those
superpowers for an ongoing megadrought that is [killing]{.underline}
their [relatives and compatriots]{.underline}. And from there is it only
a short step to planes flying into tall buildings.

Over the past couple of years, there has been something of a sea-change
in attitudes to solar geoengineering research, with governments and
funding agencies quite suddenly much more interested in detailed
modelling and even limited field trials. And, academics being who we
are, when there is research funding on the table, someone is willing to
take it. There is even a start-up offering to offset the impact of your
CO2 emissions by releasing sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere --
although, when we look at their numbers, it [doesn't look]{.underline}
particularly [attractive even at face value]{.underline}. And one thing
almost everyone seems to agree on is that uncontrolled
[[geoengineering]{.underline}]{.mark}-for-sale is a [very **[bad
idea]{.mark}**]{.underline} indeed.

I worry that this interest in partly fuelled by [misleading [rhetoric
about climate tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline}. As we explained in
the previous lecture, there is absolutely [**[no evidence]{.mark}** that
we are sufficiently close enough [to]{.mark} any global tipping point to
[justify]{.mark}]{.underline} starting down such an [inevitably
[destabilising path as]{.mark} solar
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is most worrying of all is
that even those engaged in government-sanctioned geoengineering research
barely acknowledge the issue of impact liability at all -- or if they
do, they shrug it off as somebody else's problem ("I'm a scientist, not
a tort lawyer").

Fortunately, the general public seems pretty [uniformly **[suspicious of
the idea of climate control]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the name of the
greater good, so the chances of a democracy embarking on serious
geoengineering remain small. But it remains possible that research done
in democracies might increase the chances of someone else deciding to
have a go.

While I'm [deeply [sceptical about the value of]{.mark} global
geoengineering [research]{.mark}]{.underline}, there may be applications
of solar radiation modification that do make sense, if they fall into
the category of modification of local weather rather than global
climate. Artificial clouds over to protect coral reefs from the worst
effects of heatwaves, or reflective roofs in vulnerable cities, would
both fall into this category. If these can be shown to work without
serious side-effects, and unlike global geoengineering measures there is
no reason to suppose they cannot be, then we may well, sadly, need to
start implementing this kind of "extreme adaptation" measure as the
world continues to warm.

## Warming

### AT: runaway warming\-\--1NC

#### No [runaway warming]{.underline}\-\--[empirics]{.underline} prove.

John **Cook 24**, founder of Skeptical Science who holds a Ph.D. in
Climate Science, 6/11/24, "Does positive feedback necessarily mean
runaway warming?", Skeptical Science,
https://skepticalscience.com/print.php?n=5961, :)

However, with regard to the rest of the myth, [the evidence suggests it
is **[extremely unlikely]{.mark} that [Earth]{.mark} can [enter]{.mark}
a [runaway]{.mark} greenhouse [state]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Why is that? We have two good lines of evidence to support the
contention. [Firstly, we know an **awful lot these days about the
geography and climate of Earth in the past**]{.underline}. [Ancient
geography can be determined by examining rock sequences on the
continents and noting similarities in their fossil faunas, sedimentary
environments and ancient magnetism]{.underline}.

So we know, for example, that around 55.8 million years ago, [Ellesmere
Island]{.underline}, off the NW coast of Greenland, [was a lot warmer
than it is today]{.underline}. The main geographical difference between
then and now was that the Atlantic Ocean was narrower. The faunal
difference was a lot more impressive. Where there are now glaciers and
polar bears, back then tortoises, snakes and alligators thrived. Their
fossils, along with those of redwood, ginkgo, elm and walnut, are to be
found in Ellesmere Island\'s sedimentary rocks.

The time in question is known as the **[Palaeocene-Eocene [Thermal
Maximum]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As the name suggests, [it [was]{.mark}
probably the [hottest climate experienced]{.mark} on Earth in the past
600 million years. To get temperate to subtropical temperatures in the
Arctic is indeed impressive]{.underline}. [[But **there was no
runaway**]{.mark} **beyond that**]{.underline}. Why?

Trapping of heat by CO2 and other greenhouse gases causes an energy
imbalance on Earth. This imbalance gets amplified by positive feedbacks.
A positive feedback happens when the planetary response to a change
serves to amplify that change. For example, due to burning of fossil
fuels, atmospheric CO~2~ has gone up by 50%. The resulting enhanced
greenhouse effect is heating up the planet. The heating, among other
things, melts arctic permafrost, releasing the CO~2~ and methane trapped
within it. These gases amplify that initial change. The effect
reinforces the cause, which will in turn further increase the effect,
which in turn will reinforce the cause... and on and on.

[So won\'t this spin out of control? The [answer is]{.mark} almost
certainly not.]{.underline} **[[Feedbacks are n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} just
[positive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [One very important one is that a
[warmer planet radiates more energy out to space than a cooler
one]{.mark}. **This [feedback is not only negative but]{.mark} it is
also [strong]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [positive [feedback cycles]{.mark} will [go on]{.mark} and
on, [but]{.mark} there **[will be]{.mark} a [diminishing]{.mark} of
returns**, so that after a number of cycles the effects become
insignificant]{.underline}. [Thus, if we double the atmospheric
concentration of CO2, the amount by which the response to that change -
heating - can **be amplified is approximately three
times**]{.underline}.

### AT: Runaway warming\-\--2NC

#### **No existential collapse. [Permafrost]{.underline}, [Methane]{.underline}, [Amazon]{.underline}, [AMOC]{.underline}, aren't existential.**

[Tipping points are mechanisms by which climate change begets more
climate change]{.underline}. There are various mechanisms by which
climate change will broach critical thresholds that make future climate
change more severe. These include:

[**[Permafrost]{.mark} release**: permafrost is melted ice. It has a ton
of carbon. When it melts, carbon is released, leading to more carbon
being released]{.underline}. [This effect [is]{.mark} likely to be real
**but [negligible compared to]{.mark} the direct [effect of
warming]{.mark}**. It will raise temperatures by **[about .1 C on the
high end]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**[[Methane]{.mark} clathrates]{.underline}**: [clathrates are ice
containing trapped methane]{.underline}. As these melt, methane is
released. [However, this [is]{.mark} probably **[not]{.mark} a
[big]{.mark} risk** for a few reasons]{.underline}. [First, overall
**methane emissions from permafrost release have [so far been
minor]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Second, **most [methane]{.mark} that is
released [doesn't reach]{.mark} the [atmosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Third, **[past warming]{.mark} in the paleoclimate record [didn't
cause]{.mark} much methane [release]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Fourth, **[most
[experts]{.mark}](https://www.nature.com/articles/500529b) seem to
[agree]{.mark} with this conclusion**, and this tends to be the result
of [studies on the
subject](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abcc29)]{.underline}.

**[[Amazon]{.mark} forest dieback]{.underline}**: [higher temperatures
might lead to destruction of forests]{.underline}, [thus releasing
CO2]{.underline}. However, while early studies thought this could be
significant, [this fledgling **[consensus]{.mark} has been
[overturned]{.mark}**, and the person who came up with the idea has said
he's [now less
concerned](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-could-climate-change-and-deforestation-spark-amazon-dieback/) about
it than he was originally]{.underline}. [In fact, the [negative effects
of warming]{.mark} on forests could **very well be [overwhelmed
by]{.mark} the [positive effects]{.mark} on forests**]{.underline}.

[[Boreal forest dieback]{.mark}: boreal forests are in the cold climate
of high latitudes in the Norther Hemisphere. While the North is likely
to experience diebacks, the South is likely to see expansions, so [[the
IPCC thinks](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) this is
unlikely]{.mark} to be a major source of warming]{.underline}.

[Collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: AMOC is a
system of wind currents that balances the climate by hot and cool air
around. However, it is dependent on climatic conditions that are likely
to be disrupted by climate change]{.underline}. If AMOC were shut down,
there would be major cooling of the Northern Hemisphere and warming of
the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic might cool by a whopping 1-2
degrees. This is one of the more worrying tipping points, and it could
severely impact weather conditions. If the AMOC collapsed, this would
trigger major cooling in the Northern hemisphere which could be quite
bad for global agriculture. [The **[AMOC is unlikely to collapse]{.mark}
entirely**, but will likely be weakened somewhat. In expectation this
[is]{.mark} bad but **[not catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[West African [Monsoon]{.mark}]{.underline}: a monsoon is a reversal of
winds. It brings rainfall to West Africa and the Sahel. Overall though,
[[climate]{.mark} change impacts the West African monsoon in various
ways and the net [effects are unclear]{.mark} but likely a bit bad
because it will make weather patterns less predictable]{.underline}.

[Indian Monsoons: same basic story]{.underline}.

[[Cloud feedbacks]{.underline}]{.mark}: these are likely the most
worrying tipping points. Warming causes greater precipitation, leading
to more clouds forming, which traps in more heat. Cloud feedbacks are
the [main reason
why](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00691-7), in the past,
the climate's sensitivity to more warming have increased at higher
temperatures (which means when the temperatures get higher, it becomes
easier to get still higher temperatures). This is the [most likely
scenario](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1) for very
extreme warming (\~13 degrees), but is still extremely unlikely. [While
this kind of **extreme warming would be [unlikely to cause
extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[for [similar]{.mark}
high-temperature [periods haven't]{.mark} had mass
[extinctions]{.mark}]{.underline}---it could be really, really bad, and
would pose non-trivial existential risks in the off chance it occurred.

For these reasons, while climate change will likely trigger more climate
change, [hothouse earth
scenarios](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1810141115), where most warming
is triggered by feedback loops, are quite unlikely. (Halstead also
presents a bunch of reasons the hothouse earth scenario is bogus).
[Claims that [feedback loops]{.mark} will snowball]{.underline} (bad
analogy perhaps???) [uncontrollably until the **Earth becomes like Venus
[are not supported]{.mark}** by most scientific evidence]{.underline}.
[[If]{.mark} higher temperatures were [capable]{.mark} of such
incredible feats, [we'd have become Venus during past eons]{.mark} when
temperatures and CO2 levels were far higher]{.underline}. [And [even
if]{.mark} such feedback [mechanisms were put in place]{.mark}, such all
[water]{.mark} on Earth [would be]{.mark} on track to all be
[lost]{.mark} to the atmosphere, it would **[take]{.mark} hundreds of
[millions of years]{.mark}** for this process to be
complete]{.underline}! [During this time, there'd be **[plenty of time
to adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

When estimating the existential risks from very extreme climatic
scenarios, with around 10 degrees of warming, Halstead writes:

[My back of the envelope model suggests that the [chance of burning
all]{.mark} the [fossil fuels]{.mark} over all time [is **1 in
500,000**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If we burn all of the recoverable
fossil fuels]{.underline} (3,000 GtC), [there is a 1 in 6 chance of more
than 9.6ºC.]{.underline} This suggests that over all time, [the [direct
risk of extinction from climate]{.mark} change over all time [is]{.mark}
on the order of **[1 in 3 million]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Thus, the only [scenarios where tipping points are]{.mark} a serious
[existential threat is]{.mark} one that is [very unlikely]{.mark} to
arise in practice. **The [Earth will not become
Venus]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

You rarely hear about the amount of progress we've made on climate
change. For a while, various models predicted much faster growth in CO2
emissions than we in fact observed. More recent models have been more
optimistic about how much warming we'll observe. There are a few reasons
for this.

[First, the **[cost of renewable]{.mark} energy [has gone down
drastically]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This has been dramatically
underestimated]{.underline}. Halstead writes:

[Historically, models have been too pessimistic on cost declines for
solar, wind and batteries: out of nearly 3,000 Integrated Assessment
Models, none projected that solar investment costs would decline by more
than 6% per year between 2010 and 2020. In fact, they **[declined by
15%]{.mark} per year**]{.underline}

[This chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices) from
Our World In Data shows just how rapidly solar costs have declined:

[Second, **[countries have taken]{.mark} more [dramatic]{.mark} climate
[action]{.mark}** than was anticipated]{.underline}. [**Countries
[representing 2/3]{.mark} of global emissions [have committed to]{.mark}
net-[zero]{.mark}** by 2050]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark}

**countries' [GDP]{.mark} has [rise]{.mark}n [while]{.mark} their
[emissions]{.mark} have [fall]{.mark}en**]{.underline}. [For these
reasons and others, those predicting future emissions have generally
grown more optimistic over time]{.underline}. One representative
temperature forecast comes from from [Liu et
al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3352):

[![A graph showing the temperature of the earth AI-generated content may

After reviewing a great battery of studies from Liu et al, [Meinshausen
et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04553-z), [Climate
Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/), and more, Halstead
concludes ["On current policy (i.e. RCP4.5), by 2100 we are [most likely
to end up with]{.mark} around [2]{.mark}.7°C of warming and there is a
**[1 in 20 chance of]{.mark} more than [3.5°C]{.mark}**... "the chance
of more than [6°C]{.mark} of warming is on RCP4.5, ...seems **likely
well [below 1%,]{.mark}** given that the upper **95th percentile is
3.5°C**." Scenarios with very rapid warming of 8 degrees, for instance,
are vanishingly unlikely]{.underline}.

(Though
see [here ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iIyexhLJ0wbLTH0USB_T-Y0WM2jNbwXMAbx_drJ0Ds/edit?tab=t.0)for
a different perspective with significantly higher credence in extreme
warming scenarios. What that post argues is that we shouldn't have as
much credence in mainstream climate models or economic models
conditional of growth effects conditional on various amounts of warming,
so very high warming scenarios aren't as unlikely as Halstead claims.
The author is someone I know, and he's extremely smart and studied Earth
science, though overall, I lack the expertise to evaluate who is right.
In either case, risks are fairly low.)

3 How past warming periods have gone

There have been some periods in the past during which high releases of
CO2 correlated with mass extinctions. During the end Permian disaster,
volcanic activity released huge amounts of CO2 and other gasses---with
devastating effect. About 90% of marine species died off, and species on
land fared little better. Yet this was unlikely to be mostly caused by
CO2, as historically species have been relatively proficient at
surviving higher CO2 concentrations.

[Surprisingly, in the geological record, **high [CO2]{.mark}
concentrations are [usually correlated with flourishing]{.mark}** and
abundance, not mass die-offs]{.underline}.

[[During]{.mark} the [**Mid-[Cretaceous]{.mark}
period**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay3701), for
instance, "temperatures were **[around 20ºC]{.mark} warmer than
pre-industrial levels**, while CO2 levels were between 500ppm and
1,000ppm." Despite this, the [rate of]{.mark} species [extinction did
not increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal
Maximum, temperatures [went
up](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1224126) 5°C over just
3,000 to 20,000 years. It was much hotter than it is today. The same was
true during the Eocene. [Despite this, rather than having species
extinction, there was a **[period of rapid growth]{.mark} in organism
number and biodiversity**]{.underline}. [And the same was [true
of]{.mark} the [warming periods]{.mark} during the **Miocene**,
**Mid-Pliocene**, the **last interglacial**, and the **transition into
the Holocene** from the last glacial]{.underline}.

However, these were in the distant past and warming is likely to be much
less rapid during them than during the present day. Thus, they're not
entirely representative but they still tell us something. [The
transition into the [Holocene was most recent and]{.mark} had most
[rapid]{.mark} warming, so the fact that there was [mostly just shifts
in]{.mark} the [distribution]{.mark} of species without much extinction
gives some reason for optimism]{.underline}.

While [some claim that climate change was responsible for the recent
mass [extinction of megafauna]{.mark}---of the wooly mammoth, giant
ground sloth, etc---this isn't the most likely scenario. Probably it
[was caused by humans]{.mark} overhunting these creatures]{.underline}.
This is because:

1.  [Most of the mass extinctions followed shortly after humans first
    entered a continent]{.underline}.

2.  [Only big animals went extinct, which makes sense if we were hunting
    them but is otherwise unprecedented in Earth's history]{.underline}.

3.  [Most of these animals evolved more than a million years ago and
    survived many warm periods. It would be unlikely that they'd all
    suddenly get wiped out by a warm period right before our
    existence]{.underline}.

[In fact, during the warm period from the Pleistocene into the Holocene,
humans survived and flourished]{.underline}. Humans at the time mostly
lived in Africa. Survival was much more precarious than it is today,
given the existence of modern technology. Thus, if we survived before,
that's at least some weak reason for optimism.

Now, it's true that before the breakup of Pangea, warming periods
generally led to mass extinctions. [But this hasn't been true
for hundreds of millions of years---since the breakup of Pangea. Why is
this? One answer is that the ecology of Pangea made it bad at removing
CO2 from the atmosphere]{.underline}. Another is that these extinctions
were often combined with large amounts of volcanic activity. Pangea's
geography made it very vulnerable to the gasses released from rampant
volcanism.

[The [overall]{.mark} takeaway]{.underline} from this section [is that
**[climate change]{.mark} has [not]{.mark} generally [caused]{.mark}
major species [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In other cases when
temperatures have been much higher, species have generally
flourished]{.underline}. Admittedly, previous warming has been quite a
bit slower, so this is not a perfect analogue. [But it's at least some
reason to think that **a [few degrees]{.mark} of warming [doesn't
spell]{.mark} automatic [doom]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: Warming = BioD

#### [No Biodiversity Collapse]{.underline} from warming\-\--even if, [no collapse to ag]{.underline}.

**Bentham\'s Bulldog 25**, a newsletter that reports about political
events and the aspects of morality and philosophy y, 6/28/225, "What The
Most Detailed Report Ever Compiled On Existential Risks From Climate
Change Found," *Bentham's Newsletter*,
https://benthams.substack.com/p/what-the-most-detailed-report-ever, :)

But still, **[extinction has been slow enough that we're [quite far away
from]{.mark} a mass [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It would
[take]{.mark} about **[18,000 years]{.mark} of species loss** at the
level it's been at since 1980 to reach a mass extinction]{.underline}.
[This [gives]{.mark} us **plenty of [time to
adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Now, this is probably an underestimate,
because it ignores the number of species we've made endangered which
haven't yet gone extinct. But even taking into account more aggressive
estimates, it will likely take *thousands of years* for us to trigger a
mass extinction.

Halstead [reviews ](https://www.ipbes.net/transformative-change-assessment)a
few [studies ](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02121)estimating
how much biodiversity loss climate change will cause, and estimates that
[[there **will not be a mass extinction**]{.mark} **in the near
future**]{.underline}. Thus, while species die-offs will continue, [a
mass extinction will not---at least not of the sort that could imperil
agriculture]{.underline}.

In addition, [[most extinctions have been local]{.mark} and regional.
But these **[cannot threaten ag]{.mark}ricultural yields**]{.underline}.
Halstead notes:

Following the discovery of the [[Hawaii]{.mark}an Islands by the
Polynesians 1500 years ago,]{.underline} [they [eliminated so many
species]{.mark} that even the decadal global extinction rate would have
been exceptional]{.underline}. [This has **[next to no bearing
on]{.mark} the risk of [ecological collapse outside of
Hawaii]{.mark}**]{.underline}. ([It [also **did not cause**]{.mark}
**catastrophic [ecosystem collapse in Hawaii]{.mark}**]{.underline}).

Thus, [damage to [biod]{.mark}iversity **[only threatens]{.mark} global
[civilisation if]{.mark} local biodiversity [is declining in all
regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

However, [[[most]{.mark} animal
[die-offs]{.mark}](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2011.00856.x) (95%
since 2012) have been **[relegated to islands]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For this reason, [the kind of broad, system-wide collapse needed to
imperil ecosystems is very unlikely]{.underline}. And most of this has
been brought about by unregulated egg taking and hunting. Perhaps the
sentence I found most surprising in the whole report is "The rate of

meta-analyses have shown that local species richness is fairly
stable]{.underline}

...

Interestingly, our study was followed in quick succession by three other
meta-analyses using independent data from different taxa and ecosystems
showing essentially the same thing---[no significant directional
biodiversity change when averaged across many studies]{.underline}

Thus, [there is unlikely to be massive species die-off or the sort of
mass extinction some pessimists have forecasted]{.underline}.

[[Even if]{.mark} there is, it's **hard to see how this could threaten
food production** by very much]{.underline}. [While the loss of
[pollinator species]{.mark} would [decrease food yields]{.mark}, outside
of that, it's hard to see what could go so wrong]{.underline}. [Our

**[not catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Most likely there is **[[no]{.mark} specific planetary

1.  [The area most likely to be **[richest]{.mark} in the future (China,

2.  [[Despite]{.mark} Eurasia---and especially England---having had
    [enormous loss of]{.mark} [biod]{.mark}iversity and mass ecosystem

    environmental devastation until one has hit inevitable irreversible

    [biod]{.mark}iversity loss [is]{.mark} so [deadly]{.mark}, it
    **[should have produced]{.mark} some [serious harms]{.mark} by

[Thus, the argument that climate change is an existential threat because

on]{.mark} the following inference [chain]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[Global warming + habitat loss + human predation + pollution ---\>

**[[Each step seems extremely doubtful]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [There

[The theoretical risk posed by permafrost viruses with microbial hosts
to human populations can be evaluated by exploring the origin and
evolution of pathogenic viruses and examining whether there is precedent
for microbial viruses spilling over to humans or animals]{.underline}.
Host jumps between closely related species are common at evolutionary
timescales; 61% of human pathogens and 75% of emerging human pathogens
have zoonotic origins
([122](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00042-24#core-collateral-B122)).

### AT: Tipping points

#### No [irrecoverable tipping points]{.underline}.

Seaver **Wang 23**, director of the climate and energy team at the
Breakthrough Institute, 4/17/2023, "There Is No Climate Tipping Point,
Breakthrough Institute,"
https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/climate-change-banned-words/climate-tipping-point-real,
:)

It turns out the future of our climate is a little more complicated
anyways. Many aspects of my unfinished novel's imagined climate future
are very much a part of the research consensus on climate
change---more frequent and intense wildfires, changes in the water
cycle, the decimation of pine forests by invasive beetles. My underlying
assumption, however---that at some specific moment in my lifetime, [the
Earth would cross a [climate tipping point]{.mark} and descend into
self-reinforcing madness---**[was entirely
incorrect]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

For the set of likely future scenarios we face today, [the climate
[science]{.mark} **literature [has not identified]{.mark} any
approaching global [tipping point]{.mark} after which runaway climate
change intensifies** beyond humanity's ability to arrest
it]{.underline}. [While tipping elements of the climate
system---like Arctic [permafrost]{.mark} thaw [and]{.mark} loss of
[Amazon]{.mark} forest area---do influence total warming, the
[magnitude]{.mark} of this influence [is substantially]{.mark}
[small]{.mark}er than the societal factors that will ultimately
determine the planet's climate trajectory]{.underline}.

To you, the reader, the lines above may feel stiff and overly qualified.
They, like countless similar sentences in IPCC reports and academic
papers, rely on very careful choice of terminology to maintain their
accuracy. Yet such care seems increasingly incompatible with a climate
discourse that, at times, nurses a weakness for spectacle while trying
to satisfy a hunger for clarity about the future that researchers cannot
yet provide.

One example that holds fascination for me today, just as it did for my
younger novelist self, is the topic of tipping points. More formally
called "climate tipping elements," this subject is a continuously
evolving body of knowledge that has been particularly susceptible to
confusion and misinterpretation.

\<image omitted\>

Over the years, groups of earth scientists have offered slightly
different definitions of tipping elements, and lists of proposed tipping
elements have changed with various additions and removals. Tropical
monsoons and abrupt changes in the El Niño cycle have fallen out of many
lists, while worry over the East Antarctic ice-sheet's stability is
increasing. Meanwhile, research that presents a range of possible
climate impacts after global temperatures cross some theorized tipping
point often gets summarized by writers and journalists using upper-end,
worst-case potential outcomes.

It is not particularly surprising that when arcane scientific detail
meets simplistic reporting, it results in a muddle, and it's a muddle
the term "tipping point" itself---evoking an abruptness and
immediacy not necessarily characteristic of most, let alone all, tipping
elements---perhaps adds to. Climate tipping points and "runaway climate
change" are now common parlance in climate conversations, and while
different advocates may mean different things in practice when using
these terms[, they speak to a broadly shared, yet inaccurate,
understanding that the climate system is on the verge of very unstable,
self-reinforcing, and abruptly rapid disaster]{.underline}.

[It isn't. And it's important to understand that it isn't. Taken at
rational face value, the [feeling]{.mark} that the [planet is just years
away from]{.mark} sliding beyond **a [catastrophic point]{.mark} of no
return [invites unproductive fatalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [At the
same time, the perception of an imminent climate cliff seemingly rules
out long-term planning in favor of emergency measures, skewing
discussion of climate policies in ways that can be
counterproductive]{.underline}.

Looking ahead, [the key message that the scientific community and
climate advocates should reinforce is that **[humanity will always
have]{.mark} chief [agency over]{.mark} the
[climate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There is [no]{.mark} [tipping point
beyond]{.mark} which Mother [Earth]{.mark} wrestles control of the whole
climate system away from human beings and [proceeds to punish us]{.mark}
for our sins]{.underline}.

Although the lack of an impending climate cliff may seem to dilute the
impetus for climate action, the knowledge that humanity has a decisive
hand on the thermostat actually imparts great responsibility upon us.
It's up to us not only to realize a more positive future for humans and
nature but also to define the conditions in which we will have to build
that vision.

\<Chatgpt section omitted\>

In many ways, the term "tipping point" in climate science was
predisposed to be misunderstood. Both components of the term invite
confusion.

First, the word "tipping" implies the rapidity of an unbalanced cart
toppling over. Yet in practice, [many climate science papers and reports
suggest that [rapid changes]{.mark} of state for tipping elements---say,
systematic shifts that take just 20 years or less---[are]{.mark} **rare
enough to be [the exception]{.mark}, not the rule**]{.underline}.
[Components of the climate system are sluggish on human time
scales]{.underline}, [and thus many Earth system [components change
over]{.mark} the course of decades, if not centuries or
[millennia]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [future carbon release
from [thawing permafrost]{.mark} and sea-level rise from loss of the
**Greenland ice sheet [will take]{.mark} place over [several hundred
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To an earth scientist thinking on geologic timescales, that does seem
like a very rapid transition relative to the glacial pace at which the
Earth system typically changed prior to the industrial revolution. To a
layperson who thinks about a stacked pile of blocks or the leaning tower
of Pisa tipping over, however, rapid means something different. [This
discrepancy in perspectives leads to differing expectations for how
climate tipping elements behave and how quickly or slowly their impacts
unfold]{.underline}.

Second, the word "point," too, is bound to confuse. It implies a single,
precise, known critical threshold beyond which Earth system components
tip.

In some cases---and depending on the boundaries one defines for a
climate system---that system may indeed behave nonlinearly after
crossing an exact threshold. This is the case for a system such as
the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica, a large ice sheet the size of
Florida, widely understood to be at risk of irreversible loss of mass
over the course of centuries should warming push the ice sheet across a
structural tipping point.

[However, critical thresholds are rarely precisely known]{.underline}.
[And [large]{.mark} continental-scale systems like [Arctic
permafrost]{.mark} landscapes or the Amazon rainforest may **[not
possess]{.mark} a [single]{.mark} overall climate [tipping
point]{.mark}**, but may instead exhibit nonlinear state shifts at
smaller scales in response to crossing regional and local
thresholds]{.underline}. Rainforests degrade acre by acre, while
permafrost on sunny south-facing hillsides may thaw and release carbon
sooner.

If "tipping points" is such an imperfect phrase, though, how did the
term become so widespread in popular discourse?

As is the case for many scientific concepts, the terminology of climate
tipping points originated as a theory, which researchers have
subsequently developed and explored to far greater depth. While the
first colloquial occurrences of the term "tipping point" in English
writing date back to around the 19th century, social and political
scientists began using a tipping point framework to describe political
movements and rapid socioeconomic shifts in the decades following World
War II.

Following the journalist Malcolm Gladwell's popularization of the term
with his book "The Tipping Point" in the early 2000s, Earth
science subsequently imported the term to help articulate the idea of
Earth system components that might undergo state shifts---fast or
slow---at critical thresholds. Some of the early scientific
discussions revolved around a potential global-scale tipping point, and
others referred imprecisely to as "tipping points." Gradually, most
scientists settled upon the term "tipping elements," defined as "a
critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly
and/or irreversibly," as the latest IPCC report puts it.

But even now, there is wide variation in the extent to which the term
"tipping points" is used in scientific literature to refer to a fast
process, or a slow one, and whether it's a general conceptual framework
or something that can be defined mathematically or statistically.

On top of this, [candidate members of the tipping elements club have
shifted as scientific understanding of different Earth system components
has progressed. For instance, some researchers once proposed the
possibility of abrupt future decline in [Arctic]{.mark} summertime [sea
ice]{.mark}, but this [hypothesis has faded]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with
subsequent [research reinforc]{.mark}ing the conclusion that
Arctic summer **sea [ice declines steadily]{.mark} in proportion to
increasing greenhouse gas emissions**]{.underline}. Similarly, theories
that projected substantial abrupt state shifts in monsoon circulation or
the El Niño cycle have largely been laid to rest. [Papers from a decade
ago raised alarm at the [possibility]{.mark} that huge amounts [of
methane]{.mark} could [bubble]{.mark} out of the ocean with apocalyptic
consequences]{.underline}. [But we now understand that frozen
methane buried deep in seafloor sediments responds only slowly and
gradually to warming, [releas]{.mark}ing **a [trickle]{.mark} of
atmosphere-[warming methane over]{.mark} centuries and
[millennia]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Maximum]{.underline} (a period about 20,000 years ago), [leading to
major swings in the climate that affected North America and
Europe]{.underline}.

Contemporary climate models show wide variation in their 21st century
projections of AMOC weakening: Some predict substantial AMOC weakening,
while others predict only a small amount of weakening. The new study,
led by former graduate student Dave Bonan (Ph.D.), aimed to better
understand the physical mechanisms governing AMOC behavior in climate
models, with the goal of reconciling these discrepancies.

The research sheds light on a long-standing and previously unexplained
feature of climate models: the link between the present-day and future
strength of the AMOC.

\<image omitted\>

Climate models that simulate a stronger present-day AMOC tend to project
greater weakening under climate change. The researchers found that this
relationship stems from the depth of the AMOC. A stronger AMOC typically
extends to greater depths and allows changes in surface water
temperature and salinity properties---caused by global warming and
freshwater input---to penetrate deeper into the ocean and drive greater
weakening.

In other words, a climate model with a stronger and deeper AMOC is less
resilient to surface changes and experiences proportionally more AMOC
weakening than one with a shallower current.

[[Climate models]{.mark} with a shallower present-day AMOC [still show
weakening]{.mark} under climate change, [but to a lesser extent]{.mark}
than those with a deeper present-day AMOC]{.underline}.

[The new study uses this understanding to constrain future AMOC

A system of currents known as the Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation ([AMOC]{.underline}) [connects the world's
oceans]{.underline}. Global warming is expected to substantially weaken
this system, which in turn would profoundly alter regional and global
climates. [Comprehensive climate models suggest that the **[AMOC will
not shut down]{.mark} completely [even under extreme climate]{.mark}
conditions**]{.underline}, but the mechanisms that prevent a full
collapse have been unclear. On page 987, Baker et al.2 finally identify
the AMOC-stabilizing mechanisms through an analysis of simulations using
several climate models --- bolstering our understanding of the key
processes that affect the resilience of the AMOC to a warming world.

The AMOC consists of two main components: a warm and salty flow of water
travels northwards through the upper layers of the Atlantic Ocean before
sinking to the deep ocean in the subpolar North Atlantic; and the
resulting deep water forms a cold flow that returns southwards,
eventually welling back up to the surface in the Southern and the
Indo-Pacific oceans (Fig. 1a).[Baker et al. analysed simulations from 34
climate models to assess the AMOC's stability in [two extreme]{.mark}
scenario[s]{.mark}. In the first scenario, atmospheric levels of
[carbon]{.mark} dioxide have [quadrupled]{.mark} compared with
pre-industrial levels; [and]{.mark} in the second, a large amount of
[fresh water]{.mark} has [entered]{.mark} the North [Atlantic]{.mark},
as would occur with melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The authors find
that, [in all]{.mark} models, the **[AMOC weakens but is sustained by
upwelling]{.mark} in the Southern Ocean**, [driven by strong
winds]{.mark} in that region]{.underline}.

To understand the AMOC-sustaining mechanism proposed by Baker et al.,
consider an analogy in which a tank contains all of the water in this
circulation. Water enters the tank from an inlet, which represents the
sinking water in the subpolar North Atlantic; and water exits through
two outlets, which represent upwelling in the Southern and Indo-Pacific
oceans. To prevent the tank from overfilling or emptying, the amount of
water flowing in must equal the amount exiting. This means that when the
flow entering the tank decreases (analogous to a weakening of the AMOC),
then water must exit through the two outlets more slowly.

[Baker and colleagues suggest that the water **[upwelling]{.mark} in the
Southern Ocean [cannot slow down]{.mark}** [because]{.mark} it is driven
by persistent [strong winds]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the tank analogy,
this equates to one of the outlets pumping out water at the same rate
regardless of the amount of water coming in --- which would cause the
tank to empty if the inflow of water decreases.

[In that scenario, **[one way to prevent emptying is to reverse]{.mark}
the [flow]{.mark} of water** at the second outlet]{.underline}. [This is
what Baker et al. observe in climate models: [a circulatory
system]{.mark} develops in the Pacific Ocean [that feeds deep
water]{.mark} to the Southern Ocean]{.underline} (Fig. 1b). However,
this secondary source of water is too small to fully compensate for the
reduced inflow from the subpolar North Atlantic. [The [requirement
that]{.mark} the [upwelling]{.mark} in the Southern Ocean [must be
balanced]{.mark} by downwelling in the Atlantic or Pacific
[means]{.mark} that downwelling in the subpolar North Atlantic [cannot
completely shut off]{.mark}, **[preventing a full collapse]{.mark} of
the AMOC**]{.underline}.

On the basis of their analysis, [Baker et al. conclude that the
**[likelihood of total]{.mark} AMOC [collapse]{.mark} in the
twenty-first century [is extremely low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
finding contradicts those of several studies that used statistical
analyses of observations and simulations of the AMOC3--5. However,
climate models are not perfect representations of the real world, and it
has been suggested6 that they might overestimate AMOC stability. [Baker
and colleagues argue that AMOC [stability is not overestimated]{.mark}
in climate models, [because it is associated with]{.mark} persistent
[Southern]{.mark} Ocean [winds that]{.mark} might [actually strengthen
slightly in]{.mark} a [warmer climate]{.mark}]{.underline}. And even if
the flow of deep water from the subpolar North Atlantic becomes
insufficient to support upwelling in the Southern Ocean, deep water will
instead form in the Indo-Pacific.

[[Another factor that]{.mark} might **[prevent]{.mark} complete AMOC
[collapse is melting]{.mark} of the [Antarctic ice
sheet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} the resulting [melt]{.mark}
water [flows into]{.mark} the [ocean]{.mark}, it [leads to a decrease
in]{.mark} the [formation of Antarctic bottom water]{.mark} --- the
densest ocean water in the world, which forms when salty water at the
surface of the Southern Ocean cools and sinks to the sea
floor]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} the formation of bottom water (and the
associated [sinking]{.mark}) [is reduced by]{.mark} the influx of [melt
water]{.mark}, [then]{.mark} the [sinking of water in]{.mark} the
**[subpolar]{.mark} North Atlantic [will increase]{.mark} slightly to
compensate, [stabilizing the AMOC]{.mark}**]{.underline} 7,8.

[The importance of Southern Ocean winds to the AMOC has previously been
highlighted: these winds are thought to be one of the factors that
induce water to sink in the North Atlantic]{.underline} 9 . [This raises
the question of whether the main driver of the AMOC is the sinking in
the subpolar North Atlantic or the upwelling in the Southern
Ocean]{.underline}. [Baker and colleagues' findings suggest that the
**[main influence of]{.mark} the [upwelling]{.mark} in the Southern
Ocean [is to limit]{.mark} how weak the [AMOC]{.mark} can
become**]{.underline}.

[The **[AMOC]{.mark} may [have slowed]{.mark}** in recent
decades]{.underline} (22, 23) [and is [expected to slow further]{.mark}
in the twenty-first century]{.underline} (24). On the other hand, an
enhanced ocean heat transport (OHT) into the Arctic has been observed
(13, 25, 26) and projected (4, 10), which has been suggested as a
contributing factor to Arctic warming (4, 10, 27--29). [This increased
northern high-latitude OHT is primarily attributed to Atlantic water
warming]{.underline} (30--32)[, as the temperature-driven OHT increase
outweighs the circulation-driven OHT decrease]{.underline}.
[Consequently, from the standpoint of Atlantic-Arctic OHT change, the
**AMOC's impact on Arctic amplification is essentially
attenuated**]{.underline}.

While several studies have hinted at the role of ocean circulation in
Arctic amplification by comparing fully coupled and slab-ocean model
simulations (33, 34), the difference between the two simulation suites
includes the effects of both the AMOC and gyre circulations, such as
those in the subpolar Atlantic and Arctic. Furthermore, the AMOC has
been suggested to be tightly linked to Atlantic subpolar ocean
temperatures (28) and subpolar gyre circulation (35). As a result, it
remains unclear how AMOC changes influence Arctic amplification.

To address this scientific question, we isolate and quantify the impact
of a weakened AMOC on Arctic amplification within a fully coupled
climate system under anthropogenic warming by the end of the
twenty-first century. Based on the historical and RCP8.5 (Representative
Concentration Pathway 8.5; free-AMOC hereafter) simulations by the
Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), we perform a parallel
sensitivity experiment (fixed-AMOC hereafter) with the same model since
1980. This experiment is driven by the same historical and RCP8.5
forcing agents as the free-AMOC simulation but with freshwater gradually
removed over the subpolar North Atlantic and uniformly redistributed to
the rest of the global oceans (36--39) (*Materials and Methods*). Due to
the freshwater removal, the AMOC strength remains nearly constant since
1980 in the model simulation. This fixed-AMOC simulation shows an
insignificant AMOC trend of 0.00 ± 0.03 Sv decade^−1^ (ensemble mean
trend ± one SD of trends among ensembles, 1 Sv = 10^6^ m^3^ s^−1^) from
1981 to 2100, whereas the free-AMOC experiment shows a significant AMOC
decline trend of −0.75 ± 0.03 Sv decade^−1^ during this period (Fig.
1*A*). The difference between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations
enables us to elucidate how the weakened AMOC influences Arctic
amplification through altering atmospheric energy transport (AET), OHT,
and a variety of local physical processes.

Results

The AMOC Impact on the Arctic Amplification.

We begin by comparing the changes in surface air temperature over the
Arctic (60^o^N--90^o^N) between observations and the free-AMOC
simulation (*Materials and Methods*). Despite decadal variability, both
observations and model simulation display a significant trend of rapid
surface warming in the Arctic (Fig. 1*B*). Between 1901 and 2022,
observations show a warming trend of 0.17 ± 0.01 °C
decade^−1^ (observational mean trend ± one SD of trends among
observations), while the free-AMOC simulation shows a warming trend of
0.27 ± 0.01 °C decade^−1^ (ensemble mean trend ± one SD of trends among
ensembles). The overlap of observations and model results suggests that
CCSM4 can generally well simulate the observed Arctic warming.

We further examine Arctic surface (2-m) air temperature changes in the
two suites of CCSM4 simulations. Between 1981 and 2100, Arctic warming
trends are 0.72 ± 0.02 °C decade^−1^ and 0.85 ± 0.02 °C
decade^−1^ (ensemble mean trend ± one SD of trends among ensembles) for
the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations, respectively. [Notably, the
**[free-AMOC]{.mark} simulation [reveals]{.mark} a [slower
warming]{.mark} rate** [compared to]{.mark} the fixed-[AMOC]{.mark}
simulation]{.underline}. [This difference [becomes more pronounced
after]{.mark} the 20[30s]{.mark} and reaches its peak during the last
two decades of the century]{.underline} (Fig. 1B). [A comparison between
the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations reveals approximately **[2 °C
less]{.mark} warming generally [across the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}
during 2081 and 2100 (Figs. 1*B* and 2 *A* and *B*). [This reduced
warming, or AMOC-induced anomalous cooling, is [particularly striking in
the North Atlantic]{.mark}, adjacent to the south of Greenland, often
referred to as the North Atlantic warming hole]{.underline} (36) (Fig.
2*C*). Our findings are further substantiated through the analysis of
zonal-averaged surface temperature and Arctic amplification factor (AF)
changes (Fig. 1 *C* and *D*). [The [weakened AMOC **decelerates Arctic
warming by 1.3**]{.mark}**7 °C [and reduces]{.mark} the Arctic [AF by
0.36]{.mark}** in terms of the annual and ensemble mean]{.underline}.
Seasonally, the AMOC-induced cooling is most prominent during the cold
seasons from December to March.

Physical Processes in the Diminished Arctic Amplification.

To better understand the physical processes by which a weakened AMOC
influences Arctic amplification, we use radiative kernels (40) to
quantify radiative feedback and partial temperature contributions
(*Materials and Methods*) to Arctic amplification. The partial
temperature contribution is helpful for comparing the relative strengths
of feedbacks; however, it is a diagnostic decomposition of the local
energy budget, and the warming attributed to any individual feedback
need not be realized. This distinction is due to the interactions
between feedbacks and with climate system characteristics such as ocean
heat content at seasonal scales (41), and the use of transient
simulations. Meanwhile, because our simulations are identically forced
by anthropogenic factors (i.e., greenhouse gases and aerosols), the
radiative forcing cannot explain the different surface temperature
responses. As a result, we include the forcing-associated warming in the
residual rather than calculating it explicitly, noting that the
difference in residuals in Fig. 3*C* is near zero. Among a variety of
factors, we find that surface albedo feedback emerges as the main driver
of the annual mean Arctic warming, which, on average, explains 3.52 K
and 4.12 K of Arctic warming over 2081 to 2100 in the free- and
fixed-AMOC simulations, respectively (Fig. 3 *A* and *B*). The surface
albedo feedback results from sea ice melting, which decreases surface
reflectivity and increases the absorption of solar radiation, thereby
warming the surface. [Given that feedbacks interact and compensate for
one another, while the surface albedo feedback promotes a large
radiative response, **other processes are crucial in how the surface
temperature change manifests**]{.underline}, as we will show below.

\<figure omitted\>

The extent of the impact of surface albedo feedback closely aligns with
the reduction in annual mean Arctic sea ice concentration. Despite
Arctic sea ice dwindling in response to global warming in both CCSM4
simulations (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 A and B), the decrease in sea ice
cover across the Arctic is 10% less severe for a weakened AMOC than it
would be in the case of a fixed AMOC. However, in specific regions
adjacent to the Atlantic and central areas between the Beaufort Sea and
Chukchi Sea, the lessened sea ice reduction can reach up to 20% (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1C). [The relatively less abated Arctic sea ice,
particularly in regions near the Atlantic, is linked to the weakened
Atlantic overturning and associated decrease in the northward
OHT]{.underline} (20, 39, 42) [across the Atlantic sector]{.underline}
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2). [The [reduced sea ice loss around]{.mark} the
Beaufort Sea and [Chukchi Sea]{.mark}, on the other hand, is likely
linked to air--sea--ice interactions]{.underline} (41) [[as well
as]{.mark} a decrease in the northward OHT through the [Bering
Strait]{.mark}]{.underline} (41). [**This is [because]{.mark} the
[weakened AMOC]{.mark} can [deepen]{.mark} the [Aleutian low]{.mark}
during boreal winter** [via]{.mark} atmospheric
[teleconnections]{.mark}]{.underline} (36) [and hence modify the ocean
circulation and heat transport over the Bering Sea]{.underline}.
Compared to the fixed-AMOC case, the slowed AMOC diminishes the increase
of the northward OHT through the Bering Strait by 0.01 petawatt (PW)
between 2081 and 2100 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Over the Arctic region,
[the [abated sea ice loss induces]{.mark} approximately
**[44%]{.mark}**]{.underline} (−0.60 K) [of the reduced
warming]{.underline}, which is primarily attributed to surface albedo
feedback (Fig. 3C), **[[particularly evident in areas characterized
by]{.mark} [relatively pronounced reduction of]{.mark} sea [ice
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Fig. 2G and SI Appendix, Fig. S1C).

[The **[AMOC slowdown]{.mark} can also [effectively modulate]{.mark}
Arctic [warming]{.mark}** by changing annual mean ocean heat
uptake/loss. We find that the **weakened AMOC [reduces]{.mark} Arctic
[warming by]{.mark} approximately [34%]{.mark}**]{.underline} (−0.47 K)
[[via altering ocean heat]{.mark} uptake/loss over the Arctic
Mediterranean]{.underline} (43), **[[making it]{.mark} the second most
[substantial contributor to]{.mark} the [cooling]{.mark}
process]{.underline}** (Fig. 3C). [To elucidate the detailed oceanic
cooling process, we calculate the difference in ocean temperature
budgets between the free- and fixed-AMOC simulations]{.underline}
between 2081 and 2100 (Materials and Methods). [We [find]{.mark} that a
[weakened AMOC causes]{.mark} a general [OHT divergence and]{.mark}, as
a result, a [cooling]{.mark} tendency of whole-depth water in the
subpolar North Atlantic as well as the Atlantic sector of the
Arctic]{.underline}, including the Labrador and Greenland Seas (Fig.
4A). [This [OHT divergence]{.mark} promotes ocean heat uptake via the
ocean surface]{.underline} (Fig. 4B), [primarily through turbulent heat
flux]{.underline} (36, 44, 45) (SI Appendix, Fig. S8K), [but it also
[dominates]{.mark} the [ocean temperature budget]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[resulting in]{.mark} a [net cooling]{.mark} of Arctic
waters]{.underline} (Fig. 4C), [diminished ocean heat
storage]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} a [lessened sea ice loss]{.mark} in
these regions]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C). [To counterbalance
the AMOC-induced OHT divergence]{.underline}, [the [ocean responds by
absorbing]{.mark} more [heat]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the
[atmosphere]{.mark}, [thereby]{.mark} engendering a [cooling]{.mark}
effect on [surface]{.mark} temperature]{.underline}. It merits attention
that beyond the Labrador and Greenland Seas, the AMOC slowdown may
indirectly affect the local processes (17) over the Barents, Kara, and
Chukchi Seas, where OHT divergence and ocean heat uptake are also
visible (Fig. 4 A and B).

\<figure omitted\>

On the other hand, the AMOC-enhanced ocean heat uptake change (Fig. 4E)
is much larger in magnitude than the AMOC-induced net TOA radiation
change (Fig. 4D), which induces a general convergence of AET over the
Arctic, particularly over the North Atlantic warming hole and around the
Bering Strait (Fig. 4F). The zonally integrated AET reveals that the
weakened AMOC causes an overall net increase in the total AET (Materials
and Methods) in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes, owing
primarily to an enhanced (stationary plus transient) eddy energy
transport component (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The increase in the
northward AET at 60°N amounts to 0.04 PW, meaning that the AMOC-induced
AET change enhances rather than reduces Arctic amplification (Fig. 3C).
It is also worth noting the opposite AET and OHT changes caused by AMOC
slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes (SI
Appendix, Fig. S2), which leads to a much smaller change in the total
atmospheric and oceanic energy transports and indicates the Bjerknes
compensation (19, 46).

[The **[slowed AMOC]{.mark} can also [have]{.mark} a [significant impact
on Arctic amplification via]{.mark} temperature feedback**]{.underline}.
Specifically, [the contributions from vertically uniform temperature
change, known as the [Planck]{.mark} feedback, are **[1.80 K
with]{.mark} a [weakened]{.mark} AMOC and 2.10 K with a fixed
AMOC**]{.underline} (Fig. 3 A and B). [The **[Planck feedback promotes
warming]{.mark} of the Arctic [because]{.mark} the [feedback is
weaker]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., less stabilizing) [in the Arctic
than in the tropics; it is calculated as a deviation from its global and
annual mean]{.underline} (Materials and Methods). [Contributions arising
from deviations from a vertically uniform temperature change, known as
the lapse rate feedback, are 1.70 K for the free- and 2.02 K for the
fixed-AMOC simulations]{.underline} (Fig. 3 A and B). Collectively, [a
**[weakened]{.mark} AMOC could [result in]{.mark} approximately
[43%]{.mark}**]{.underline} (−0.61 K) [of the [cooling]{.mark} effect in
the Arctic [due to]{.mark} the total temperature
[feedback]{.mark}]{.underline}. [AMOC-induced changes in the Planck
response primarily appear as a surface cooling across the Arctic and its
neighboring regions]{.underline}. However, a notable exception is the
North Atlantic warming hole, where the Planck response contributes to an
anomalous surface warming (Fig. 2D). This geographic distinction reveals
that the Planck response is weaker over the North Atlantic warming hole
in the free-AMOC simulation, leading to a more significant anomalous
warming effect than in other regions due to the strikingly colder
surface temperatures in this area (47). In contrast to the free-AMOC
simulation, the Planck response is weaker over the central Arctic in the
fixed-AMOC simulation. Despite this difference, the temperature changes
caused by the Planck response are largely offset by those caused by the
lapse rate feedback. In the North Atlantic warming hole and
Beaufort/Chukchi Sea regions, the surface cooling due to lapse rate
feedback highlights an unevenly distributed vertical temperature profile
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3). [[In response to]{.mark} **a [weakened
AMOC]{.mark}, [air temp]{.mark}erature[s show marked cooling]{.mark}**
in the lower-to-mid troposphere, while the upper troposphere exhibits
weaker cooling]{.underline}.

In comparison to the aforementioned factors, AMOC-induced changes in
cloud feedback (4%; 0.06 K) and water vapor feedback (12%; −0.17 K)
contribute less to Arctic amplification. The cloud feedback, in
particular, can be further divided into a shortwave (sw) cloud feedback
and a longwave (lw) cloud feedback. A weakened AMOC would add
approximately 13% (0.18 K) to Arctic warming via sw cloud feedback in
comparison to a fixed AMOC, but this effect is largely compensated by
the cooling effect from lw cloud feedback (Fig. 3C). Regardless, the
rationale for the warming is that less Arctic sea ice is associated with
fewer low clouds (48, 49). Thus, as the AMOC decelerates and sea ice
loss becomes less pronounced, the cloud fraction diminishes (SI
Appendix, Figs. S1C and S4C). In particular, fewer low-level clouds (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4C) reduce the amount of sw radiation that is reflected
back into space and hence warm the surface of the Arctic.

Additionally, the influences of surface albedo feedback and ocean heat
uptake change are inextricably linked on seasonal timescales, such that
their relative importance in Arctic amplification may vary by season
(7, 17, 41, 50--53). In a warming climate, **[[Arctic]{.mark} surface
[albedo feedback is especially strong during]{.mark} boreal
[summer]{.mark}]{.underline}** (JJA; SI Appendix, Fig. S5 A and B),
[when large sea ice reduction]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig.
S1 D and E) [leads to more open ocean]{.underline}, [allowing more
atmospheric heat]{.underline} (primarily solar energy) [to enter and be
stored in the central Arctic Ocean]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig.
S9 A and E). [Consequently, ocean heat uptake acts to abate summertime
Arctic warming]{.underline}. [The stored oceanic heat is released to the
atmosphere during boreal winter]{.underline} (DJF), [which does not
always occur in the same locations as summer solar energy absorption due
to horizontal advection of heat in the ocean]{.underline} (17).
[Wintertime oceanic heat release is particularly prevalent in the Kara,
Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas, where significant sea ice loss
occurs]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig. S10 D and H). [Sea ice loss in
these regions opens the ocean, exposing warmer ocean surfaces to colder
air and creating a large air--sea temperature contrast]{.underline}. As
a result, [the ocean releases heat to the atmosphere via turbulent heat
flux and drives wintertime Arctic warming]{.underline} (SI Appendix,
Fig. S10 C and G). It merits attention that the North Atlantic warming
hole region experiences persistent anomalous ocean heat uptake (or
diminished oceanic heat release) throughout all seasons, differing from
the seasonal ocean heat uptake and loss in the central Atlantic.

[The **[AMOC slowdown abates Arctic warming through surface
albedo]{.mark} feedback, [particularly during]{.mark} boreal
[summer]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Fig. 3 D and E), [rather than
winter]{.underline}. [This is because, while the [weakened AMOC
mitigates Arctic sea ice loss all year]{.mark} round]{.underline} (36)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S1), [the Arctic is dark during boreal winter, nearly
eliminating surface albedo feedback]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig.
S5 C and D). Additionally, [the AMOC slowdown slightly reduces the
cooling effect of ocean heat uptake during boreal summer]{.underline}
(Fig. 3D), especially over the central Arctic. [However, it dramatically
weakens the warming effect in boreal winter]{.underline}, [which serves
as the strongest AMOC-influencing factor on Arctic surface temperature
during this season]{.underline} (Fig. 3E). [This [AMOC effect]{.mark} is
[achieved through reduced oceanic heat release]{.mark} in the central
Arctic and persistent anomalous ocean heat uptake south of
Greenland]{.underline} (SI Appendix, Fig. S10L).

Gail Whiteman and colleagues suggest that the opening up of the Arctic

effects resulting from a sudden release of 50 gigatonnes of methane from
the area (Nature 499, 401--403; 2013). [However, our literature review

penetration]{.mark} into the subsea permafrost]{.underline} (see F. J.
W. Parmentier et al. Nature Clim. Change 3, 195--202; 2013). [We
therefore believe that the **proposed scenario is
unlikely**]{.underline}. Although the Arctic Ocean represents a
substantial source of methane, there are still many unknowns. [Any
research that assumes a large increase in emissions from that region
should therefore include ample discussion of the uncertainties relating
to this source]{.underline}

Arctic: uncertainties in methane link We disagree with Gail Whiteman and
colleagues that there is "likely" to be a large and sudden release of
methane from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (Nature 499, 401--403;
2013). [[Such an event **would require**]{.mark} **an almost
[1,000-fold]{.mark} regional [increase in]{.mark} methane [emissions
from]{.mark} thawing [permafrost]{.mark}**, which [would be inconsistent
with]{.mark} [geological evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}: [although the
concentration of atmospheric methane rose in response to abrupt warming
during recent deglaciations]{.underline}, [isotopic [methane]{.mark}

## Nuclear Meltdown

organization that promotes nuclear power and supports the companies that
comprise the global nuclear industry. Its members come from all parts of
the nuclear fuel cycle, including uranium mining, uranium conversion,

The main safety concern has always been the possibility of an
uncontrolled release of radioactive material, leading to contamination
and consequent radiation exposure off-site. Earlier assumptions were
that this would be likely in the event of a major loss of cooling
accident (LOCA) which resulted in a core melt. The TMI experience
suggested otherwise, but at Fukushima this is exactly what happened.
[[In]{.mark} the [light of better understanding]{.mark} of the physics
and chemistry]{.underline} of material [in a reactor core under extreme
conditions]{.underline} it [[became evident that]{.underline} [even a
severe core]{.underline}]{.mark} [[melt]{.underline}]{.mark} [coupled
with breach of containment [would be **unlikely to create a major
radiological disaster**]{.mark}]{.underline} from many Western reactor
designs, but the Fukushima accident showed that this did not apply to
all. Studies of the post-accident situation at TMI (where there was no
breach of containment) supported the suggestion, and analysis of
Fukushima will be incomplete until the reactors are dismantled.

[From the outset,]{.underline} there has been a [strong awareness of the
potential hazard of both nuclear criticality and release of radioactive
materials]{.underline} from generating electricity with nuclear power.

As in other industries, the [[design]{.mark} [and operation]{.mark} of
nuclear power plants [aims to **minimize the likelihood of
accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and **[[avoid major]{.mark} human
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** when they occur.

There have been [two major reactor accidents]{.underline} in the history
of civil nuclear power -- [Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi]{.underline}.
Chernobyl involved an intense fire without provision for containment,
and Fukushima Daiichi severely tested the containment, allowing some
release of radioactivity.

These are the [**only major accidents** to have occurred **in over
18,500 cumulative reactor-years** of commercial nuclear power operation
**in 36 countries**]{.underline}.

The **[[evidence over six decades]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[nuclear power is]{.mark} a
[safe]{.mark} means of generating electricity]{.underline}. The
[[risk]{.mark} of accidents in nuclear power plants [is **low and
declining**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The consequences of an accident or
terrorist attack are minimal compared with other commonly accepted
risks. [[Radiological]{.mark} [effects]{.mark} on people]{.underline} of
any radioactive releases **[[can be avoided.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In relation to nuclear power, [safety is closely linked with
security]{.underline}, and in the [nuclear field also with
safeguards]{.underline}. Some distinctions apply:

Safety focuses on unintended conditions or events leading to
radiological releases from authorized activities. It relates mainly to
intrinsic problems or hazards.

Security focuses on the intentional misuse of nuclear or other
radioactive materials by non-state elements to cause harm. It relates
mainly to external threats to materials or facilities (ee information
page on Security of Nuclear Facilities and Material).

Safeguarding focuses on restraining activities by states that could lead
to acquisition or development of nuclear weapons. It concerns mainly
materials and equipment in relation to rogue governments (see
information page on Safeguards to Prevent Nuclear Proliferation).

**[[No industry is immune]{.mark} from accidents]{.underline}**, but
**[[all]{.mark} industries [learn]{.mark}]{.underline}** from them. In
civil aviation, there are [accidents every year]{.underline} and [each
is meticulously analysed]{.underline}. The lessons from nearly one
hundred years' experience mean that reputable airlines are extremely
safe. In the chemical industry and oil-gas industry, [major
[accidents]{.mark} also [lead to improved safety]{.mark}]{.underline}.
There is wide public acceptance that the risks associated with these
industries are an acceptable trade-off for our dependence on their
products and services. With nuclear power, the high energy density makes
the potential hazard obvious, and this has always been factored into the
design of nuclear power plants. The few accidents have been spectacular
and newsworthy, but of little consequence in terms of human fatalities.
The novelty value and hence newsworthiness of nuclear power accidents
remains high in contrast with other industrial accidents, which receive
comparatively little news coverage.

Harnessing the world\'s most concentrated energy source

In the 1950s attention turned to harnessing the power of the atom in a
controlled way, as demonstrated at Chicago in 1942 and subsequently for
military research, and applying the steady heat yield to generate
electricity. This naturally gave rise to concerns about accidents and
their possible effects. However, with nuclear power, [safety depends on
much the same factors as in any comparable industry]{.underline}:
[intelligent planning, proper design with conservative margins and
back-up systems]{.underline}, high-quality components and a
well-developed safety culture in operations. The operating lives of
reactors depend on maintaining their safety margin.

A particular nuclear scenario was loss of cooling which resulted in
melting of the nuclear reactor core, and this motivated studies on both
the physical and chemical possibilities as well as the biological
effects of any dispersed radioactivity. Those responsible for nuclear
power technology in the West devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring
that a meltdown of the reactor core would not take place, since it was
assumed that a meltdown of the core would create a major public hazard,
and if uncontained, a tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities.

In [avoiding such accidents the industry has been very
successful]{.underline}. In the 60-year history of civil nuclear power
generation, with **[[over 18,500 cumulative reactor-years across 36
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there have been [[only]{.mark} [three
significant accidents]{.mark}]{.underline} at nuclear power plants:

[[Three Mile]{.mark} Island]{.underline} (USA 1979) [where]{.underline}
the [reactor was severely damaged but radiation was
contained]{.underline} and there were [no adverse health or
environmental consequences]{.underline}.

[[Chernobyl]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of
the reactor by steam explosion and fire killed two people initially plus
a further 28 from radiation poisoning within three months, and had
significant health and environmental consequences.

[[Fukushima]{.mark} Daiichi]{.underline} (Japan 2011) where three old
reactors (together with a fourth) were written off after the effects of
loss of cooling due to a huge tsunami were inadequately contained. There
were [no deaths or serious injuries due to radioactivity]{.underline},
though about 19,500 people were killed by the tsunami.

[[Of all the accidents]{.mark} and incidents]{.underline},
[[only]{.mark} the [Chernobyl and Fukushima]{.mark}]{.underline}
accidents [[resulted in radiation doses]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
public greater [than those resulting from the exposure to natural
sources]{.underline}. The Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation
exposure of workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their
health, unlike Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one \'accident\') have
been completely confined to the plant.

Apart from Chernobyl, [[no nuclear workers]{.mark} or members of the
public [have ever died as a result of exposure]{.mark} to
radiation]{.underline} due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident.
[Most of the serious radiological injuries and deaths]{.underline} that
occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures above regulatory
limits) [are the result of large uncontrolled radiation
sources]{.underline}, [such as abandoned medical or industrial
equipment]{.underline}. (There have also been a number of accidents in
experimental reactors and in one military plutonium-producing pile -- at
Windscale, UK, in 1957 -- but none of these resulted in loss of life
outside the actual plant, or long-term environmental contamination.) See
also Table in Appendix 2: Serious Nuclear Reactor Accidents.

The [[Scare of Three]{.mark} [Mile]{.mark} Island]{.underline}. In March
1979, a [[series of mechanical]{.mark} [and human errors]{.mark} at the
Three Mile Island nuclear power plant]{.underline} in Pennsylvania
[[lead to partial meltdown]{.underline}]{.mark} in the reactor,
[resulting in a limited release of hazardous radioactive
gas]{.underline} into the atmosphere. [Officially]{.underline}, the
affair **[[caused no fatalities or injuries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But
the [lack of prior crisis planning]{.underline} for nuclear accidents
[resulted in poor coordination]{.underline} between first responders and
poor communication with the public.

About [40 percent of the people who lived within 15 miles of Three Mile
Island were evacuated]{.underline}. Inconsistent accounts of events by
authorities led to news reports and media dramatizations that created
chaos during the evacuation that was far worse than the accident itself.
Television specials following the accident used sensational titles for
their broadcasts, like ABC's "Three Mile Island: Nuclear Nightmare."
Nearby residents withdrew cash from the bank and put their homes up for
sale. Area priests stoked fears by granting "general absolution." Mass
protests took place across the country in response to the accident,
including one in New York City that attracted 200,000 people.

[But for all the panic]{.underline}, the **[[health effects of]{.mark}
the accident [were minimal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [approximately [2
million people]{.mark} around the reactor]{.underline} during the
accident are [estimated to have [received]{.mark} an average
[radiation]{.mark} dose [of only about **1 millirem**]{.mark} above
background levels]{.underline}. For comparison, a [[typical chest X-ray
carries]{.mark} a [6]{.mark} millirem dose]{.underline}.

After the accident, public support for nuclear energy in the United
States fell from a record high of 69 percent in 1977 to 46 percent in
1979. The next power plant in the United States would not be built for
more than 30 years. Today, support for nuclear power in the United
States remains lukewarm. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, 49 percent of
Americans favor use of nuclear energy and 49 percent oppose. The [major
limitation today is the high cost.]{.underline}

The [Reality of Chernobyl]{.underline}. The Chernobyl accident of April
26, 1986 left a much deeper mark than Three Mile Island, both in terms
of real effects of the disaster and the public perception of it.
[Disaster struck because the plant suffered from profound defects in
reactor design, lack of a requisite safety culture, and mistakes made by
the power station operators.]{.underline}

7-16-2025)//CMSW-ShajSpec

Despite these accidents, **[[nuclear energy has saved far more lives
than it has taken]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Based on historical
electricity production data and mortality and emission factors from
peer-reviewed scientific literature, a [NASA science brief claims that
[nuclear power]{.mark} [prevented]{.mark} perhaps [1.8 million
deaths]{.mark} worldwide between 1971 and 2009]{.underline}. The brief
details that, in the absence of nuclear power, the energy it produced
would most certainly have been produced with fossil fuels, likely coal,
which would have led to higher pollution-related mortality rates. On the
basis of these data, NASA concludes that nuclear power should be
retained and expanded.

Of all the sources of electricity generation, **[[nuclear]{.mark} energy
may be among [the safest]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} According to
data gathered by science writer Phil McKenna in 2011 immediately
following the Fukushima accident, nuclear energy causes between 0.2 and
1.2 deaths for every 10 terawatt hours of electricity generated. Coal,
by contrast, causes between 2.8 and 32.7 deaths for every 10 terawatt
hours. In his report, McKenna found **[[nuclear]{.mark} energy to be
[safer than hydroelectric]{.mark} power [and natural gas]{.mark} as
well.]{.underline}**

In one extreme example, a 1975 [[hydroelectric dam]{.mark} disaster in
China [accounted for]{.mark} between 150,000 and [230,000
deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[far surpassing even the high estimates
of deaths related to nuclear powe]{.mark}r]{.underline}**. In 2005
alone, there were 3,306 accidents in Chinese coal mines, resulting in
5,938 deaths, followed by 4,746 deaths the next year. Finally, even
though the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 was responsible for far
fewer human deaths (11 deaths and 17 injuries), the oil contaminated
more than 57,500 square miles (149,000 square kilometers) of the Gulf of
Mexico and cost over \$40 billion to clean up.

The fact is that [producing energy---nuclear or otherwise---can be
dangerous]{.underline}. But the world runs on energy. [[Despite]{.mark}
the [trauma]{.mark} caused]{.underline} by the accidents at Three Mile
Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, [officials across the [world
learned]{.mark} important lessons in reactor design]{.underline},
operation, and regulatory practices, all contributing to improved
safety. Nuclear safety culture is now a central tenet in the design and
operation of nuclear reactors. The increasing role of passive safety
features and extensive vetting of reactor designs has made
"meltdown-proof" reactors the standard goal in the nuclear energy field.
Indeed, safety was identified by the Generation IV International Forum
as a key component in the design of new nuclear reactors. Compare the
risks of nuclear energy to those of other energy sources and nuclear
energy becomes an essential component for sustainable, low-carbon
electricity generation.

Moreover, it is not simply that governments and energy suppliers can use
nuclear energy safely. It is that they must. The world's energy demand
is rising and cannot run on fossil fuels alone---at risk of further
aggravating the effects of climate change---or be supplemented solely by
other renewable energy sources.

So, while the lessons from nuclear disasters should not be forgotten and
the risk of repeating those disasters must be minimized, nuclear energy
remains a necessary part of a future sustainable energy mix. While other
concerns such as cost may remain barriers to an expansion of nuclear
power, safety should not.

#### c. Accidents are a [lesson]{.underline} for the future -- allow for [innovation]{.underline} and [regulations]{.underline} that prevents increased accidents

[[Following]{.mark} the [Chernobyl]{.mark} disaster, [nuclear
safety]{.mark} culture [became a tenet]{.mark} of the global nuclear
power industry]{.underline}. The International Atomic Energy Agency
began to actively promote safety-by-design, the practice of building
inherent safety features into the design of new power plants. For its
part, the Russian nuclear industry recovered. It was able to implement a
massive integration of safety culture into the design and operation of
its new nuclear power plants. The result is that Russia has become the
leading exporter of nuclear power plants today.

The [Lesson of Fukushima. After the Chernobyl disaster, the [world did
not see another major nuclear accident for 25
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. On March 11, 2011, a [magnitude 9.0
earthquake and a 15-meter-high tsunami hit Japan]{.underline}, causing
widespread disaster across coastal Japan. This [included loss of
electricity]{.underline} to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant,
which resulted in a loss of cooling and, ultimately, a nuclear meltdown.
As three containment vessels were breached, hydrogen escaped into the
atmosphere and there were explosions in Units 1, 3, and 4.

The late Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
Yukiya Amano, observed that [a [major contributing factor]{.mark} of the
accident was the assumption that Japanese nuclear power plants were
simply too safe for a disaster of this scale ever to]{.underline} occur.
Neither operators, nor regulators, nor the Japanese government
challenged this assumption. As a result, **[[Japan was not
prepared]{.underline}]{.mark}** for such a massive disaster.

The earthquake and tsunami directly lead to the deaths of 15,000 people
and the injury of 6,000 more. Many are still missing. More than 100,000
people were evacuated from the area around the Fukushima Daiichi plant,
most of whom have not been allowed to return. [In contrast to the
immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl accident]{.underline}, the United
Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation reported
in 2013 that [there were [no deaths attributed]{.mark} [to
radiation]{.mark} following the incident]{.underline}. However, in 2018
a plant worker died from lung cancer believed to be the result of
radiation exposure.

The UN committee noted that, though the doses to the general public are
not expected to cause "discernible increased incidence of
radiation-related health effects," the biggest health effect is on the
mental and social well-being of people due to the disaster and the fear
it created. Following the disaster, civil support for nuclear power
unsurprisingly plummeted in Japan.

In June 2012, 70 percent of the Japanese population believed the
Japanese government should reduce the role of nuclear power, increased
from only 44 percent before the accident. This was compounded by
widespread fear of the contamination of the soil in Fukushima prefecture
and coastal waters surrounding the plant.

Negative sentiment toward nuclear power has continued in Japan despite
the conclusions of the World Health Organization that the general
population would not see a rise in baseline cancer risks. The percentage
of the Japanese public that believes nuclear power is necessary has
steadily dropped since the accident, from 35.4 percent in 2010 to 23.5
percent after the accident in 2011 and to 17.9 percent in 2017.

However, the [[disaster at Fukushima has left powerful lessons]{.mark}
on weaknesses in plant design]{.underline} on one hand [and emergency
preparedness]{.underline} and response on the other. The assumption that
only a short loss of power was possible led designers not to prepare for
longer blackouts. Nor did they consider that not one but many reactors
at a plant could suffer from crisis at the same time.

The [accident emphasized the importance of choosing a proper
site]{.underline} to build a nuclear power plant, especially in an
earthquake-prone region of an island nation, and having an independent
regulator to ensure adequate safety of design and operations of
reactors.

The clarion call for nuclear energy. There is [[no doubt that]{.mark}
the [effects]{.mark} of nuclear disasters [are
frightening]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but they [should be viewed as lessons
for the future]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than reasons to eliminate
this useful, low-carbon source of energy. [Three Mile
Island]{.underline} left a scar on the US nuclear industry for several
decades, but it le[d to significant improvements in regulations and
operations]{.underline} of US reactors. [Chernobyl left
portions]{.underline} of Ukraine and Belarus
[uninhabitable]{.underline}, [but sparked important improvements in
nuclear safety]{.underline} that changed the design and operation of
nuclear power plants in Russia.

Despite these accidents, [**[nuclear energy has saved far more lives
than it has taken]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Based on historical
electricity production data and mortality and emission factors from
peer-reviewed scientific literature, a [NASA science brief claims that
nuclear power prevented perhaps 1.8 million deaths worldwide between
1971 and 2009]{.underline}. The brief details that, in the absence of
nuclear power, the energy it produced would most certainly have been
produced with fossil fuels, likely coal, which would have led to higher
pollution-related mortality rates. On the basis of these data, NASA
concludes that nuclear power should be retained and expanded.

Of all the sources of electricity generation, nuclear energy may be
among the safest. According to data gathered by science writer Phil
McKenna in 2011 immediately following the Fukushima accident, nuclear
energy causes between 0.2 and 1.2 deaths for every 10 terawatt hours of
electricity generated. Coal, by contrast, causes between 2.8 and 32.7
deaths for every 10 terawatt hours. In his report, McKenna found nuclear
energy to be safer than hydroelectric power and natural gas as well.

In one extreme example, a 1975 hydroelectric dam disaster in China
accounted for between 150,000 and 230,000 deaths, far surpassing even
the high estimates of deaths related to nuclear power. In 2005 alone,
there were 3,306 accidents in Chinese coal mines, resulting in 5,938
deaths, followed by 4,746 deaths the next year. Finally, even though the
Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 was responsible for far fewer human
deaths (11 deaths and 17 injuries), the oil contaminated more than
57,500 square miles (149,000 square kilometers) of the Gulf of Mexico
and cost over \$40 billion to clean up.

The fact is that [producing energy---nuclear or otherwise---can be

concerns such as cost may remain barriers to an expansion of nuclear
power, safety should not.

Although the weapons have certainly generated obsession and have greatly
affected military spending, diplomatic posturing, and ingenious
theorising, [the few [countries]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} the [weapons

Although there are conceivable conditions under which nuclear weapons
could serve a deterrent function, it is questionable whether they have
yet ever done so. In particular, [it is [far from clear]{.mark} that
[nuclear weapons]{.mark} are what [kept]{.mark} the [Cold War from
becoming]{.mark} a [hot]{.mark} one. Indeed, each leak from the archives
suggests that the [Soviet Union never]{.mark} seriously
[considered]{.mark} any sort of direct [military aggression against the

Vojtech Mastny puts it, "The [strategy of [nuclear deterrence \[was\]
irrelevant to deterring a major war]{.mark}]{.underline} that the enemy
did not wish to launch in the first place."2

Moreover, the [[weapons]{.mark} have [not proved]{.mark} to be
[crucial]{.mark} status -- or virility -- symbols]{.underline}. How much
more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? [[Would
anybody pay]{.mark} a great deal more [attention to Britain or France if

[Insofar as [most leaders of most countries (even rogue ones) have
considered acquiring the weapons, they]{.mark} have come to [appreciate
several defects: nuclear weapons are dangerous, distasteful, costly, and

Hymans has demonstrated, [the [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[also]{.mark} been [exceedingly difficult to obtain]{.mark} for
administratively dysfunctional countries like Iran]{.underline}.3 In
consequence, [**[alarmist predictions about proliferation]{.mark}**
chains, cascades, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and points of
no return [have **proved to be faulty**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[It is [sometimes said]{.mark} that [proliferation]{.mark} has [had
little consequence because]{.mark} the only [countries]{.mark} to
possess nuclear weapons have [had **rational leaders**. But nuclear
weapons have proliferated to large, important countries run by
unchallenged monsters who, at the time they acquired the bombs, were
certifiably deranged]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, when he got his bomb,
the Soviet Union's Stalin had been plotting to "transform nature" by
planting lots of trees and was given to wandering around the Kremlin
mumbling that he could no longer trust anyone, not even himself.4 And
when China's Mao got his bomb, he had recently launched an addled
campaign to remake his society that created a famine killing tens of
millions.5 [Yet neither country used its nuclear weapons for anything
other than deterrence and ego-boosting.]{.underline}

[Why have [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [projects]{.mark} around the world
[become]{.mark} **increasingly inefficient** and **[prone to
failure]{.mark}** since the 1970s]{.underline}? [One reasonable
hypothesis is that the [slowdown is due to]{.mark} the
**Non-Proliferation Treaty ([NPT]{.mark}).**]{.underline} [[Almost every
state]{.mark} in the world [is now party]{.mark} to the treaty and has
signed NPT safeguards agreements that make its nuclear activities
relatively transparent to the outside world]{.underline}. This is a good
thing. But the NPT does not deserve the lion\'s share of the credit for
the global proliferation slowdown. Recall that the main puzzle is not
why so many states have chosen to abstain from building the bomb, but
rather why the numerous states that aggressively flouted the NPT in
recent years have so often fallen into nuclear R&D quagmires. [This
record of dysfunction could conceivably be chalked up to the
[difficulties of getting around]{.mark} the **NPT regime\'s [technical
safeguards]{.mark}**, on-site inspections, and export bans]{.underline}.
Yet it is universally acknowledged that those mechanisms were quite
feeble until the early 1990s. For instance, the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and Western intelligence services were unaware of
Saddam Hussein\'s massive nuclear weapons project before stumbling
across it at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. Therefore, even if
we stipulate that the nonproliferation regime today is very tough to
deceive or circumvent---a claim that many would dispute---it was
undeniably much less formidable in the 1970s and 1980s, and yet the
great proliferation slowdown was already well in evidence at that
time.Footnote^10^ Thus, for all the merits of the NPT, it was not the
"silver bullet" that caused the trend toward nuclear weapons project
inefficiency.

A second, more convincing hypothesis starts from the observation that
[[most]{.mark} of the [states that]{.mark} tried to [obtain]{.mark}
nuclear [weapons during]{.mark} the first two decades of the [nuclear
age were]{.mark} in the [developed]{.mark} world, [but most]{.mark} of
the states [that have attempted]{.mark} to do so since that time have
been in the developing world]{.underline}. [What is it about most
developing countries that might cause their nuclear weapons projects to
run so inefficiently]{.underline}? One might guess that they cannot
afford to devote the same amount of money as wealthier countries to
their nuclear projects. But Iraq was able to spend a billion dollars on
its nuclear weapons efforts during the 1980s, and it came up short
anyway. In fact, the average per capita income (in constant 1990
international dollars) of the states that built the bomb was \$3,773 at
the start of their projects, but the average of the unsuccessful ones
was considerably higher---\$5,520. Clearly, we need to probe beneath
such brute quantitative indicators to understand the true sources of
developing country nuclear weapons project inefficiency.

The R&D success stories of the first four members of the nuclear
club---the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and
France---provide a good starting point for analysis. [The classic
historical studies of these efforts concur that their efficient
[performance was due]{.mark} in large measure [to]{.mark} their
scientific and technical ([S&T]{.mark}) workers' autonomy and
professionalism]{.underline}.Footnote^11^ In other words, [the S&T
workers [were]{.mark} not merely [well-educated but]{.mark} were [also
able to control their]{.mark} own work [process]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Therefore, key decisions could be based on well-considered expert
reasoning [rather than arbitrary commands]{.mark} or political
ideology]{.underline}. Moreover, [the workers' enjoyment of autonomy
mixed with their feelings of nationalism to generate a strong collective
motivation to achieve the project\'s goal. This pattern can be seen in
the totalitarian Soviet Union as well as in the three democratic
countries]{.underline}.

If autonomous professionalism is the key to nuclear weapons success,
[then why haven't [more recent]{.mark} proliferant [states]{.mark} from
the developing world respected it, too? The simple answer is that they
[have been **highly prone to**]{.mark} **nuclear program
[mismanagement]{.mark}**; the deeper answer is that their state
institutions have made them prone to mismanagement]{.underline}. Most
developed countries can be described---to borrow the language of Max
Weber---as having "legal-rational" institutions.Footnote^12^ In other
words, [they [feature strong institutional barriers]{.mark} against the
top-down politicization of bureaucratic policy implementation,
especially on scientific and technical questions]{.underline}.
[Political [leaders]{.mark} in such contexts may well want to [interfere
in]{.mark} technical [decision-making]{.mark}, but doing so is costly
and runs [contrary to standing behavioral norms]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, [they adopt a management model [that]{.mark} is respectful
of the S&T workers' need for autonomy. This choice [creates the
conditions for professionalism]{.mark} to flourish]{.underline}.

By contrast, most developing countries can be described---again,
following Weber---as having "neopatrimonial"
institutions.Footnote^13^ In other words, they feature "big man" rule
and lack the strong institutional barriers that characterize Weberian
legal-rational states. Political leaders in such contexts find it easy
to interfere in technical decision-making; in fact, the bureaucracy
practically expects it of them. Consequently, they adopt a management
model that undermines professionalism. And the more strongly a
neopatrimonial state\'s leaders desire the bomb, the more invasive their
management of the nuclear program is likely to be.

In sum, [when you start with legal-rational state institutions, you are
likely to end up with the kind of management that facilitates the
efficient operation of nuclear weapons projects: management that is
respectful both of the laws of thermodynamics and of the professional
S&T workers who understand those laws. This was the typical pattern of
the early nuclear efforts, most of which were carried out by developed
countries]{.underline}. On the other hand, when you start with
neopatrimonial state institutions, you are likely to end up with the
kind of management that undercuts the efficient operation of nuclear
weapons projects: management that privileges considerations of ideology
or political expediency over those of empirical science, and favors
sycophants over committed professionals.Footnote^14^ This has been the
typical pattern of the more recent nuclear efforts, most of which were
carried out by developing countries. (As for the nuclear weapons
projects of countries that stand somewhere in the middle of this
spectrum, the management approach they adopt tends to reflect the
overall direction in which their state institutions have been evolving.)

I am not claiming that neopatrimonial states are incapable of building
the bomb. [What I am claiming is that their [nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[projects will]{.mark} usually **take much longer and will [fail]{.mark}
much more often than most international security analysts would dare to
hope**]{.underline}. Moreover, [since [many states are still finding it
so difficult]{.mark} to build the bomb, **we [should be very skeptical
of]{.mark} claims that stateless [terrorist groups]{.mark} could easily
make one, too**]{.underline}.

[[Media reports]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} [a '[zombie'
virus]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[deliberately misstate
facts]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What are the public health implications of
misleading information?

[Unearthing [microbes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
the Siberian [[permafrost **isn't new**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[[Researchers]{.mark} have [been at it **for many years**]{.mark}
now]{.underline}, amid concerns of melting ice caps releasing ancient
and hitherto unknown bacteria and viruses to the world. But [[recent
news]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} a set of
[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} [revived [from]{.mark} the
[permafrost]{.mark} made headlines [as a "zombie
virus]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} --- **[[a misleading
monicker]{.underline}]{.mark}** that could have public health concerns.

To be clear, [scientists]{.underline} from the French National Centre
for Scientific Research [recovered and revived 13 viruses]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} the Siberian permafrost, one of which is over 48,500
years old. They've laid dormant in the ice so far, but [scientists have
begun reviving]{.underline} [them]{.underline} following mounting
concerns of global warming thawing the ice and releasing potentially
infectious agents into the world. The viruses are "zombie viruses,"
then, only insofar as they have "reanimated" from a state of dormancy
over millennia. But the [[story has taken a **life of its
own**]{.underline}]{.mark}, with [many speculating that the nature of
infection]{.underline} that these viruses [can spread is akin to a
zombie outbreak]{.underline}.

Moreover, the [[findings **aren't peer-reviewed**]{.mark}
yet]{.underline}, which [makes the reporting on the virus' threat to the
public premature]{.underline}. Here is how the researchers used the term
"zombie virus":

"While the literature abounds on descriptions of the rich and diverse
prokaryotic microbiomes found in permafrost, no additional report about
'live' viruses have been published since the two original studies
describing pithovirus (in 2014) and mollivirus (in 2015). This
**[[wrongly suggests]{.mark} that such [occurrences are
rare]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that '[zombie
viruses' are **not a public health threat."**]{.underline}

The [part that's new about the findings is that it's the oldest known
example]{.underline} of a virus that's [capable of returning to an
infectious state]{.underline}. But [this is a
[characteristic]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of all
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}: [**[technically, all viruses are zombie
viruses]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

There's a raging debate among scientists about whether to even
characterize viruses as living or dead at all --- as they occupy a
unique position in limbo between the two states. Ever [[since]{.mark}
their [discovery in the **19th century**]{.mark}]{.underline}, they've
been classified as everything from biological weapons, to poison, to
non-living parasites. They show almost none of the hallmarks of life,
save for one: they reproduce by making copies of themselves. Besides
that, they don't have cells, they don't metabolize energy, and they
cannot survive outside a living host for too long. And yet, they contain
genetic material. The scientist E. Rybicki noted that viruses are "at
the edge of life."

This means that the [[sensation]{.mark} around the ancient virus
uncovered in Siberia [is **misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline}: it's not
so much the fact that the virus is a zombie, as it is that it's capable
of infection despite its age. This could be dangerous --- but the
important fact remains that we still know nothing about the nature of
infections any of these viruses are capable of inducing.

"If the authors are indeed isolating live viruses from ancient
permafrost, it is likely that the even smaller, simpler mammalian
viruses would also survive frozen for eons," Virologist Eric Delwart,
who was not involved in the study, told New Scientist.

[Terminology matters]{.underline}. Previously, [[alarmist claims]{.mark}
about the Covid19 vaccines]{.underline} [leading to a zombie
apocalypse]{.underline} [contributed to dangerous vaccine
hesitancy]{.underline} --- and it was based on a CDC presentation that
used a zombie apocalypse as a fictional scenario to train people on
emergency responses. Research on Covid19 creating zombie cells created a
similar panic --- notwithstanding that "zombie cells" are a term given
to aging cells that cause disease in the body.

Viruses in themselves are weird, undead, and inert in the absence of a
host --- and that's what the permafrost contains. [Giving it a
name]{.underline} [that singles out a particular virus as a "zombie
virus"]{.underline} [in an age of misinformation, conspiracy theories,
and fake news]{.underline}, then, [is [**irresponsible** at best]{.mark}
--- and [**dangerous** at worst]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### No disease extinction -- [vaccines]{.underline}, [immune systems]{.underline}, and [sanitation]{.underline}

**Adalja 16** -- Amesh Adalja is an infectious-disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh. (6-16-2016; \"Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out
the Human Race?\"; Atlantic;

"You'll tell us when you're worried, right?"

That was the question posed to me countless times at the height of the
2014 West African Ebola outbreak. As an infectious disease physician, I
was interviewed on outlets such as CNN, NPR, and Fox News about the
dangers of the virus, and the answer I gave was always the same:
"[[Ebola]{.mark} is a [deadly, scary]{.mark} disease, but it is
[not]{.mark} that [contagious]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [[will not
find]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. or other industrialized nations
**[[hospitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

In other words, no, I wasn't worried---and not because I have a rosy
outlook on infectious diseases. I'm [well-aware of the damage these
diseases are causing]{.underline} around the world: HIV, malaria,
tuberculosis; the influenza pandemic that took the world by surprise in
2009; the anti-vaccine movement bumping cases of measles to an all-time
post-vaccine-era high; antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening to
collapse the entire structure of modern medicine---all these, like
Ebola, are continuously placing an enormous number of lives at risk.

But when people ask me [if I'm worried about infectious
diseases]{.underline}, they're often [not asking about the threat to
human lives]{.underline}; they're [asking about the threat to human
life]{.underline}. [[With each outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark} of a
headline-grabbing emerging infectious disease [[comes]{.mark} a [fear of
extinction]{.mark} itself.]{.underline} The [fear envisions a large
proportion of humans succumbing to infection]{.underline}, [leaving no
survivors]{.underline} or so few that the species can't be sustained.

I'm **[[not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
but I do understand the impulse. [[Worry]{.mark} about the end
[is]{.mark} a quintessentially [human
trait]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Thankfully, [so is our
resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[For most of mankind's history]{.underline}, [[infectious diseases were
the existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark} to humanity---and for good
reason. [They were [quite successful at killing]{.mark}
people]{.underline}: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out
an estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century
Black Death decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic
killed 5 percent of the world; [malaria is estimated to have killed half
of all humans who have ever lived]{.underline}.

Any [[yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, **[[humanity]{.mark}
continued to [flourish]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our [species' [recent
explosion]{.mark}]{.underline} in lifespan is almost
[[exclusively]{.mark} the [result of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [control
of infectious diseases through **[sanitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[vaccination]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[antimicrobial therapies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only [in the modern
era]{.underline}, in which many [infectious [diseases have been
tamed]{.mark}]{.underline} in the industrial world, do [[people]{.mark}
have the luxury of [death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke]{.mark}
in the 8th decade of life.]{.underline} [[Childhoods]{.mark} are [free
from watching siblings]{.mark}]{.underline} and friends **[[die]{.mark}
from outbreaks of typhoid]{.underline}**, scarlet fever,
**[smallpox]{.underline}**, **[measles]{.underline}**, and the like.

So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, [an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction]{.underline}, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to
combat the enemy organism. Fortunately, **[[outside of
fiction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, there's [**[no reason to expect alien
pathogens]{.mark}** to [wage war]{.mark} on the human race]{.underline}
any time soon, and my [analysis suggests that [any **real-life**]{.mark}
**domestic [microbe]{.mark}** [reaching]{.mark} an [extinction]{.mark}
level of threat probably [is **just as
unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by
infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short.

[Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special
combination of two attributes]{.underline}. [First, it would have to be
so unfamiliar that no existing therapy]{.underline} or vaccine [could be
applied]{.underline} to it. Second, it [would need to have a high and
surreptitious transmissibility]{.underline} before symptoms occur. The
first is essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens
would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians.

[The [three infectious diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} [[most likely to be
considered extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}-[level threats]{.underline}
in the world today---influenza, HIV, and Ebola---[[don't meet]{.mark}
these [two requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}. Influenza, for instance,
despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown." While there
are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the
time of Hippocrates, **[[humans have been attuned to its
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And in the modern era, a [[full-fledged
industry]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} influenza
**[[preparedness exists,]{.underline}]{.mark}** with **[[effective
vaccine strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[antiviral
therapies]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is
similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, HIV's
dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola)
requires intimate human-to-human contact, which limits contagion. Highly
potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the
disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations
that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly,
simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug
users and barrier contraceptives---when available---can curtail
transmission risk.

Ebola, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others,
also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it
spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable
symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality
rate by simple supportive care.

Beyond those three, [[every other]{.mark} known [disease]{.mark}
**[falls short]{.mark}** of what seems required to wipe out
humans]{.underline}---which is, of course, why we're still here. And
it's not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, [diseases'
failure to knock us out is a [testament to just how **resilient** humans
are]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Part]{.underline} [of our evolutionary
heritage is our [immune system]{.mark}]{.underline}, one of [**[the most
complex]{.mark}** on the planet]{.underline}, [even without]{.underline}
the benefit of [[vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark} or the helping hand of
antimicrobial drugs. This system, when viewed at a species level,
**[[can adapt]{.mark} to almost any enemy imaginable]{.underline}**.
Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans---which open up the
possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection
to a tendency for mild symptoms---this [**[adaptability]{.underline}**
[ensures]{.underline}]{.mark} that almost [any infectious
[disease]{.mark} onslaught [will leave a large proportion]{.mark} of the
population [alive]{.mark} to rebuild]{.underline}, [[in contrast
to]{.mark} the fictional [Hollywood]{.mark}
[versions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

While the [immune system's role can never be understated]{.underline},
an [even more powerful protector is the faculty of
consciousness]{.underline}. Humans are not the most prolific, quickly
evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle
identified, [[humans are]{.mark} the [rational]{.mark}
animals]{.underline}---and it is [this fundamental [distinguishing
characteristic]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[allows]{.mark} humans to form
[abstractions]{.mark},]{.underline} think in principles, [[and **plan
long-range**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [These capacities]{.underline}, in
turn, [allow humans to modify, alter, and improve
themselves]{.underline} and their environments. Consciousness equips us,
at an individual and a species level, to make nature safe for the
species through such technological marvels as antibiotics, antivirals,
vaccines, and sanitation. When humans began to focus their minds on the
problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty,
brutish, and short. In many ways, [[human
consciousness]{.underline}]{.mark} became [[infectious diseases'
**worthiest adversary**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

None of this is meant to allay all fears of infectious diseases. To
totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be foolish---and dangerous.
Humans do face countless threats from infectious diseases: witness Zika.
And if not handled appropriately, severe calamity could, and will,
ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak, for instance, festered for
months before major efforts to bring it under control were initiated.

When it comes to infectious diseases, I'm worried about the failure of
institutions to understand the full impact of outbreaks. I'm worried
about countries that don't have the infrastructure or resources to
combat these outbreaks when they come. But [[as]{.mark} [long as we can
keep adapting]{.mark}]{.underline}, I'm [[not worried about the
future]{.mark} of the human race.]{.underline}

#### China fears consequential western backlash from an axis.

[And yet [China's leadership]{.mark} remains [**conflicted**
about [Russia](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/russia)]{.mark},
[**fearing** entanglement in]{.mark} Putin's radical
[anti-Western]{.mark} schemes and eyeing with apprehension the prospect
of a cold war that China neither wants nor knows how to fight. [Beijing
**does not want to commit** to]{.mark} a formal [Chinese-Russian
alliance]{.mark} and **bitterly** [resists]{.mark} the idea that it
belongs to an ["axis"]{.mark} of some sort [with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, North Korea, and Iran. And Kim Jong Un's
regime in Pyongyang is increasingly the main source of irritation in
Beijing.

In January 2025, I took part in discussions in Beijing and
Sanya, [China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/china), organized
by Tsinghua University, that were intended to serve as a form of Track
II diplomacy, a practice in which nonstate civil society actors from
various countries meet to discuss relations between their governments.
This dialogue brought together academics and former senior officials and
diplomats from China, Russia, and the United States for heated but
productive conversations.

One striking insight emerged from these talks: [the main reason for
Beijing's seeming **unwillingness** to build a trilateral coalition with
Russia and [North
Korea](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/north-korea) is that [such
an arrangement]{.mark} would [call for strategic leadership by
China]{.mark}, and Beijing is decidedly **uninterested** in such a
prospect. That is partly because any axis led by Beijing would require a
mission around which its allies could unite---and no one in Beijing
seems to know what that mission should be.]{.underline}

China's hesitancy to head an alliance of unreliable partners in a
struggle against the West suggests that [its [leaders]{.mark} are
[aware]{.mark} of the [**high costs** of confrontation]{.mark} and are
[hedging their bets]{.mark}. President Donald [Trump's]{.mark}
unconventional [diplomacy]{.mark}, which pairs militant rhetoric and
[threats of economic warfare]{.mark} with promises of [great-power
cooperation]{.mark} with [China and Russia]{.mark}, has [added]{.mark}
to **[uncertainty]{.mark}** in Beijing [about the United States']{.mark}
direction.]{.underline} As a result, Washington has a golden opportunity
to test China's intentions through renewed diplomatic efforts, even
while gearing up for containment.

LEADER'S REMORSE

The consultations I attended focused on the question of China's
relationship with the rogue regime in North Korea. In the Chinese
participants' view, [Beijing did not encourage Kim's recent pivot to
Russia, which culminated in a treaty of alliance with Russia in June
2024;]{.underline} indeed, it seems likely that Beijing was not even
consulted in advance of this move. [Nor did Xi approve North Korea's
direct involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine, which has included
the deployment of some 10,000 North Korean soldiers to Russia's Kursk
region]{.underline}, to repel a Ukrainian incursion. This move showed
that [Kim is willing and able to act independently of
Beijing]{.underline}, even as he continues to rely on trade with China
for his regime's survival. In offering troops and large quantities of
munitions to Putin, [Kim has made a point of showing Xi that **he is not
China's vassal**]{.underline}.

The Russians at these consultations lamented the lack of coordination
among China, North Korea, and
Russia. [Putin](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/vladimir-putin), who
meets frequently, albeit separately, with Xi and Kim, would like to have
a trilateral summit to forge closer relations among all three countries.
But Xi and Kim have not seen each other since 2019. The countries
formerly held trilateral consultations, most recently in October 2018,
but North Korea now resists such meetings, preferring the company of
Russia to China.

[[Beijing]{.mark}, too, is [unwilling to create a bloc in East
Asia]{.mark}, partly [out of **fear**]{.mark} that it would
cause [[Japan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/japan), South
Korea, and]{.mark} the [United States]{.mark} to [build a]{.mark} more
overtly [anti-Chinese bloc]{.mark}. The [Chinese]{.mark} also
[worry]{.mark}, [much more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the [Russians]{.mark}
do, [about North Korea's nuclear program]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Russians have pragmatically resigned themselves to a nuclear North
Korea. But Beijing, seeing the potential knock-on effects in Japan and
South Korea---which could be pushed to start nuclear programs of their
own---may be keen to resume denuclearization talks with Pyongyang, even
if the goal of a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula appears out of reach.
Some Chinese participants expressed concern about North Korean
militancy, including the possibility that the Kim regime will launch
military provocations against South Korea. Unsurprisingly, [[China fears
being **dragged** into a conflict by]{.mark} a restless,
[unpredictable,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} generally [unreliable client
state]{.mark}---whether it is [North Korea or

"It is a constant in a turbulent world rather than a variable in
geopolitical games."

This is how Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, described the relationship
between China and Russia during a press conference held last month on
the sidelines of the National People's Congress in Beijing. It was a
signal of confidence on China's part at a time when the US is ratcheting
up its pressure to suppress the East Asian state's rise and US President
Donald Trump is pursuing closer ties with Moscow.

[Both China and Russia]{.underline} have taken to [calling one another
their "equal" in friendship]{.underline} and emphasizing the mature,
resilient and stable fraternity between their two nations. On April 1
(local time), Russian President Vladimir Putin received Wang and
conveyed a message looking forward to Chinese President Xi Jinping's
upcoming visit to Moscow slated for May, saying the Chinese leader would
be Russia's "main guest" at the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of
the end of WWII.

[But while the two world powers]{.underline} [outwardly project an image
of a solid relationship]{.underline}, a [peek beneath the surface finds
**fissures and instability**]{.underline}. Sören Urbansky, a professor
of history at Germany's Ruhr University Bochum, says that it's important
to look at the relationship between China and Russia from a historical
viewpoint.

["**On the surface**, both sides portray their relationship as very
**friendly**]{.underline} --- as allies, almost, you may say. But in
fact, it's [just a strategic partnership]{.underline}," Urbansky says.
While they may currently enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship, that
doesn't mean the two will "automatically be friends forever. There are
[lots of areas where their interests are **not congruent**, but actually
**opposing**]{.underline}," the professor contends.

Along with Martin Wagner of the Berlin Free University's Institute for
East European Studies, Urbansky coauthored the book "China and Russia: A
Brief History of a Long Relationship," which was published in February.
In the book, the authors outline how the [relationship between Russia
and China has repeated the cycle of cooperation]{.underline},
**[competition and distrust]{.underline}** [since the 17th
century,]{.underline} when they first forged diplomatic ties.

The Hankyoreh spoke to Urbansky over Zoom on March 31 to understand
what's going on beneath the surface of Beijing-Moscow relations. His
book with Wagner is slated for publication in Korea this October.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Hankyoreh: The prevailing view is that China and Russia will continue to
have cozy relations going forward. Do you think that's the case?

Urbansky: What's [important to understand]{.underline} is the [**growing
imbalance** in the relationship]{.underline}. China is clearly the
dominant partner, while Russia is increasingly the junior one. And [true
friendship usually requires equality.]{.underline}

On the surface, both sides present themselves as equals --- Xi Jinping
hosts Putin with all the expected ceremony. But [behind closed
doors]{.underline}, [China]{.underline} likely [uses its leverage to
push its interests]{.underline}. The **[imbalance is
deepening]{.underline}**.

[Putin]{.underline} likely [hoped a swift victory in
Ukraine]{.underline} would [strengthen his position with
China]{.underline}. **[That didn't happen]{.underline}**. The
[war]{.underline} has [only made the relationship **more
asymmetrical**]{.underline} --- and I'm [not sure how long that dynamic
will serve both sides equally.]{.underline}

Hankyoreh: What would you say have been the turning points for
China-Russia relations since the 2010s?

Urbansky: The first early turning point was Russia's annexation of
Crimea in 2014. The ruble lost value --- including against the yuan ---
shifting the economic balance. Cross-border dynamics changed too: where
Russians once traveled more to China, now more Chinese go to Russia.

Trade between the two countries has grown significantly since then.
Russia, under sanctions, became more willing to sell high-tech military
equipment to China. Joint military exercises also intensified --- first
on land, now including air and sea.

Another important moment was China's launch of the Belt and Road
Initiative in 2013. Initially, Russia was hesitant and even promoted its
own alternative, the Eurasian Economic Union. While [Russia]{.underline}
later [joined the BRI,]{.underline} [China never joined the
EEU]{.underline} --- another [sign of the imbalance]{.underline}.

Hankyoreh: In your book with Martin Wagner, you argue that
[China]{.underline} appears to be simultaneously [seeking both closeness
and distance]{.underline} in its relationship with Russia. What is the
intention behind this dual approach?

Urbansky: [Officially]{.underline}, [China maintains]{.underline} a
position of [neutrality]{.underline}. It [abstains from UN
votes]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it [hasn't recognized any of
Russia's annexed territories since 2008]{.underline}. But in practice,
it's leaning toward Russia --- offering [support without]{.underline}
full [commitment]{.underline}.

That's because [China]{.underline} also [**depends heavily** on
countries opposed to Russia]{.underline}: the [US, Germany, Japan, South
Korea and others]{.underline}. It [**doesn't want to jeopardize** those
economic and political relationships.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} is also [**benefiting** from the current global
order]{.underline} --- institutions like the WTO, WHO and UN --- [and
uses them to its advantage]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, by
contrast, [has tried to disrupt that very order]{.underline}. So while
[both]{.underline} countries [may share some goals]{.underline}, they
[pursue them in very different ways.]{.underline}

Hankyoreh: Some say that Trump's cozying up with Putin is a tactic for
checking China. Do you see that to be the case?

Urbansky: This is often called a "reverse Kissinger" moment, referring
to Nixon and Kissinger's outreach to China in 1971-1972. But the
comparison doesn't hold. Back then, China and the Soviet Union were
already in open conflict. Today, China and Russia are strategic
partners, not rivals. If Trump hopes to split them, it won't be easy.
Putin won't risk his relationship with China to improve ties with the
US. He wants both --- better relations with Washington while keeping
Beijing close, especially given Russia's economic dependence on China.

Hankyoreh: What should Europe's strategy be when dealing with the
China-Russia relationship? China has sent signals of appeasement at the
Munich Security Conference, calling Europe a partner.

Urbansky: After WWII, the US built the world order. Now, it's distancing
itself from that role, which benefits China and Russia. But China's
aggressive export subventions, its handling of COVID and its pro-Russian
neutrality in Ukraine have made it a rival in European eyes.
[China]{.underline} is now [trying to rebuild trust]{.underline},
[especially with uncertainties]{.underline} surrounding the US trade
policy. Still, Europe sees China's political system as fundamentally
incompatible. So [while China may not be a truly constructive
partner]{.underline}, [Europe]{.underline} may [have few
alternatives]{.underline} if the US becomes increasingly adversarial.
[China]{.underline} [might not be ideal]{.underline} ---
[but]{.underline} it could be [the least bad option]{.underline}.

participated in with Russia and China in Oman. (EPA/Yonhap)

Hankyoreh: What sort of risks do you think China-Russia relations carry,
then?

Urbansky: **[Their strategic goals don't always align]{.underline}**.
For example, [if]{.underline} a [Trump administration pulls US troops
from Europe]{.underline}, it [helps Russia but threatens
China]{.underline}, since those forces might shift to East Asia ---
**[not in China's interest]{.underline}**. Their **[geopolitical agendas
often diverge]{.underline}**.

[China and Russia compete in]{.underline} regions like [Central
Asia]{.underline}. Russia sees it as its sphere of influence, but China
is now the top trading partner of all five Central Asian states and has
even established a military presence in Tajikistan. Similarly, [in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [Russia claims exclusive control]{.underline},
[while]{.underline} [China asserts its interests as a "near-Arctic"
state]{.underline}. So [while]{.underline} they are stra[tegic
partners]{.underline}, **[friction points remain]{.underline}**.

Hankyoreh: To what degree does North Korea represent a risk factor in
China-Russia relations? And what sort of impact will stronger
Beijing-Moscow ties have on North Korea?

Urbansky: North Korea recently sent troops to support Russia in Ukraine.
In return, it likely received advanced military technology, including
rocket systems. This shifts the balance --- North Korea is no longer
solely dependent on China.

A [stronger North Korea]{.underline}n military doesn't increase regional
stability. It [raises tensions]{.underline} in Northeast Asia, which
**[China wants to avoid]{.underline}**. [North Korea often complicates
things]{.underline} for both China and Russia due to its
unpredictability. Still, [Pyongyang wouldn't benefit from a
rift]{.underline} between Moscow and Beijing --- it would force them to
choose sides, which they'd rather avoid.

#### [Threats]{.underline} of an RCA are [misleading]{.underline} -- [public skepticism]{.underline} and [underlying nuances]{.underline} undermine it

We [**never had the relations** with China which were **that
good**]{.underline}, **[that confidential]{.underline}**, **[that
long-term build]{.underline}** and that would be enjoying support of the
peoples of both countries.\"

Source: Russian Foreign Ministry, March 12, 2025

**[Misleading]{.underline}**

On March 12, [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov]{.underline} spoke
with American bloggers Mario Nawfal, Larry C. Johnson and Andrew
Napolitano in Moscow.

[When asked whether the U.S]{.underline}. administration's [efforts to
normalize relations with Moscow are just to use Russia \"cynically
against the Chinese]{.underline},\" **[Lavrov rejected such
possibility]{.underline}**.

He [described Russia-China relations as long-term]{.underline}, stronger
and more confidential, based in deep trust and mutual understanding, and
he emphasized widespread public support in both countries.

**[That is misleading.]{.underline}**

The [claim overlooks the underlying **complexities and skepticism** in
the Russia-China relationship]{.underline}.

**[Underlying tensions]{.underline}**: [Despite]{.underline} the
[appearance of a strong partnership]{.underline}, [ongoing tensions
underlie the relationship]{.underline}. This [includes skepticism on
both sides]{.underline}, especially [about economic **stability**,
**military** strength and the extent of mutual **trust**.]{.underline}

**[Economic imbalance]{.underline}**: [China has become a dominant
economic partner]{.underline} for Russia, [but]{.underline} [many
Russians are **concerned** about China\'s increasing
influence]{.underline} and the lack of substantial Chinese investment in
Russia.

**[Military relations]{.underline}**: [Unlike]{.underline} the [strong
military alignment]{.underline} seen in the Sino-Soviet alliance of
1950, [today\'s cooperation]{.underline} is **[not as deeply
integrated]{.underline}**, particularly in military terms.
[China]{.underline} has [not provided direct military aid
to]{.underline} Russia in the Ukraine conflict, which [would have been
expected]{.underline} in a deeply allied relationship.

**[Public sentiment]{.underline}**: [There is skepticism about the
partnership]{.underline} in both Russia and China. [Russian citizens are
not entirely supportive of Chinese products or investments]{.underline},
and many [Chinese question the long-term economic and military viability
of Russia]{.underline}.

Historical context

[Sino-Soviet Alliance]{.underline} (1950s): This period [marked a high
point of cooperation]{.underline}, with the Soviet Union providing
substantial economic, technological and military support to China. Yet,
the [alliance ended with the Sino-Soviet split]{.underline} by the late
1950s. This contradicts Lavrov\'s characterization that current
relations are unprecedented in their depth.

Strategic Partnership (1996-2014): The strategic partnership
strengthened after the Cold War, especially under Vladimir Putin and
Jiang Zemin. However, China still balanced its relations with the West,
highlighting that the partnership was pragmatic, not based purely on
mutual trust.

Anti-Western Alignment (2014-2025): The relations have become closer
since Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the Ukraine invasion.
China has been providing crucial economic support.
[Beijing]{.underline}, however, [avoids direct military aid]{.underline}
to evade Western sanctions and maintains neutrality. This signals that
the [cooperation is based on shared opposition to the West]{.underline},
**[not genuine trust or an alliance]{.underline}** akin to that of the
1950s.

Current economic dependence

Moscow is now heavily dependent on Beijing: China has become Russia's
largest trading partner, and Russia plays a key role in supplying China
with oil and gas.

The [economic relationship has its imbalances]{.underline}, however.
[China\'s total investments in Russia remain relatively low]{.underline}
compared with its global investments.

[China still prioritizes its **global economic ties**]{.underline},
while [Russia]{.underline} has [become increasingly dependent on
Beijing.]{.underline}

Vedomosti, Russia's leading business daily, reported that China rarely
invests directly in Russia, noting that while Russia seeks high-tech
investments, China prioritizes mining, real estate, and banking.

Since 2023, China has been Russia's largest trading partner, whereas
Russia ranks only sixth among China's top trade partners.

Skepticism in both countries

[Russians question Chinese investment]{.underline} [and the long-term
benefits]{.underline}, while [many Chinese doubt Russia's economic
resilience and military strength]{.underline}.

In February 2025, FilterLabs released the results of research that used
its Talisman data tool to analyze Chinese and Russian news and social
media.

Talisman's [analysis reveals **deep skepticism**]{.underline} about
Russia among Chinese social media users, [many]{.underline} of whom
[question whether Russia's economy is truly as resilient as Moscow
claims,]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} its [military strength
matches its rhetoric]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [what its long-term
intentions are]{.underline}. These doubts suggest that despite official
narratives of strong ties, [public confidence]{.underline} in Russia
within China is **[far from unanimous]{.underline}**.

The research also shows that [online sentiments]{.underline} in Russia
toward economic cooperation with China are [more negative than official
narratives suggest.]{.underline}

International sanctions have pushed many Western products out of Russia,
allowing Chinese goods to fill the gap in sectors such as automobiles
and technology. While their market share grows due to affordability and
geopolitical shifts, [many Russians remain **skeptical and
dissatisfied**]{.underline} with Chinese products, FilterLabs reported.

In both countries, [social media discussions are consistently less
positive]{.underline} [than mainstream press coverage]{.underline},
[which itself was not uniformly supportive]{.underline}, [revealing
underlying skepticism]{.underline} about the partnership.

\"Their **[partnership is vulnerable]{.underline}**,\" FilterLabs
founder Jonathan Teubner told VOA.

Conclusion

While [Lavrov's statement reflects an official narrative]{.underline} of
a strong and enduring partnership, the **[truth is more
nuanced]{.underline}**. [Relations are]{.underline} indeed
[closer]{.underline} than at any point since the 1950s,
[but]{.underline} they are [shaped more by pragmatism, economic
necessity and shared opposition]{.underline} to Western influence [than
by deep trust or historical affinity]{.underline}. In both countries,
**[public opinion reveals skepticism]{.underline}**, and the economic
and military [cooperation]{.underline}, while growing, is **[not without
concerns.]{.underline}**

[[As]{.mark} Israel and then [the United States]{.mark} [battered
Iran]{.mark} this month, the [reaction from China and Russia]{.mark}
[was]{.mark} surprisingly **[muted]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For years,
shared antagonism toward the U.S. has been pushing China, Russia, and
Iran together. All three benefit from embarrassing the West in Ukraine
and the Middle East, and widening the gaps between Washington and
Europe. So after Israel's first strike, on June 13, China---the
strongest partner in the anti-America triad---could have been expected
to rush short-range missiles and other air-defense equipment to Iran.
Surely, Beijing would use its growing diplomatic muscle to isolate
Israel and the U.S., demand an emergency session of the United Nations
Security Council, and introduce a resolution deploring the two
governments that were attacking China's ally.

Instead, recent events in Iran have revealed that anti-Americanism can
bind an alliance together only so much.

[[After ritually denouncing Israel's first strike]{.mark} as ["brazen"
and a "violation
of Iran's sovereignty,"](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/wjbzhd/202506/t20250615_11648771.html) [Beijing

declaring that "**China stands ready to work** with all parties to play
a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle
East."]{.underline}

[After Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, Beijing's
foreign-affairs spokesperson stressed---in what looked like [a warning
to
Iran](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/06/23/china-calls-for-global-efforts-to-defuse-tension-over-vital-strait-of-hormuz)]{.underline}---that
the Persian Gulf is a crucial global trade route for goods and energy,
and called for partners to "prevent the regional turmoil from having a
greater impact on global economic growth."

In calmer times, China, like Russia, is happy to use Iran as a battering
ram against the U.S. and its allies. [But [when]{.mark} tensions turn
into [military confrontation]{.mark} and [global stability is at
**risk**]{.mark}, [backing Iran]{.mark} looks like a [far **less
sensible investment to Beijing**]{.mark} than preserving its own
economic and diplomatic relations with the West. [China's mild reaction
isn't just a blow to Iran]{.mark}; it may also [suggest]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} the much ballyhooed [["no limits"
partnership](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/12/china-russia-xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-friends/672586/) between
Xi]{.mark} and Russia's President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} [might not
be]{.mark} as [sturdy]{.mark} as Moscow and Beijing
advertise.]{.underline}

Iran, Russia, and China have different ideologies, political regimes,
and strategic aims. Iran's relations with its two larger partners are
wildly asymmetric.

China, for example, is Iran's lifeline. It buys about [90 percent of
Iran's
oil](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.politico.eu/article/china-finance-houthi-red-sea-attacks-iran-oil/) and
supplies [materials and
technologies](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/select-committee-republicans-call-treasury-investigate-six-chinese-companies) central
to Iran's weapons development. Yet the trading relationship matters less
to China, which gets only about [10
percent](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.politico.eu/article/china-finance-houthi-red-sea-attacks-iran-oil/) of
its oil from Iran. Plus, China has an economy more than [40 times as
large](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/data.worldbank.org/?locations=CN-IR),
and it does far more business with the U.S. and the European Union.

[[Russia has interests]{.mark} that similarly [diverge from
Iran's]{.mark}, and it, too, has [conspicuously
[refrained]{.mark}](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/06/russia-iran-israel-defense/683214/) from
c[oming to the Islamic Republic's aid]{.mark}. But [China following a
similar approach]{.mark} toward Iran likely **[does not please
Moscow]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although Moscow's relations with Beijing
are less lopsided than Tehran's are, Russia's economy is still less
than [one-eighth](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/data.worldbank.org/?locations=CN-RU) the
size of China's. One-third of Russia's state budget comes from oil
sales, and China is the [largest customer by
far](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/SANCTIONS/lgpdwakjovo/).
Russia also depends on Chinese supplies for its war machine. This past
March, the G7 foreign ministers called China
a ["decisive](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.state.gov/statement-of-the-g7-foreign-ministers-meeting-in-charlevoix/) [enabler"](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/www.state.gov/statement-of-the-g7-foreign-ministers-meeting-in-charlevoix/) of
Russia's war in Ukraine. But should the Kremlin begin to run out of
money or soldiers, China's willingness to bail out its ally is very much
in doubt.

[Even [among authoritarian regimes]{.mark}, [differences]{.mark} in
[values can **limit** cooperation]{.mark}. In 2023, [[Xi
called](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/https:/redsails.org/xi-on-marx/) Russia's
1917]{.mark} October [Revolution]{.mark} a "cannon blast" that "brought
Marxism-Leninism to China, **[demonstrating the way forward]{.mark}**
and [offering a new choice for the Chinese people]{.mark} who were
seeking a way to save China from subjugation." [Putin]{.mark}, despite
his formative years in the Soviet-era KGB[, now laments the fall of the
Russian empire]{.mark} and [describes]{.mark} Vladimir [Lenin's
coup]{.mark} as the deed of ["political adventurists and foreign
forces"](https://archive.ph/o/alTlH/kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71496) who
"[divided the country and **tore it apart** for selfish
benefit]{.mark}." The [head of C]{.mark}hina's [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty [may resent Putin's reduction of its Russian
counterpart]{.mark}---the country's second-largest party---to the status
of another bit player in Russia's rubber-stamping
parliament.]{.underline}

Since World War II, leaders of Western democracies have successfully
collaborated in part because they have shared a common worldview.
Whether Iran's Islamic theocrats can say the same about Xi, the leader
of an avowedly atheist state, or Putin, who now positions himself as the
champion of Orthodox Christianity, is another question entirely.

[Beijing's response to Iran's predicament ought to make the West feel
cautiously optimistic. If Donald Trump finally learns to distinguish the
aggressor from the victim---or at least realizes that Putin has been
playing him---the U.S. president could support Ukraine in earnest
without worrying much about China expanding its assistance to
Russia.]{.underline} As long as both Iran and Russia keep providing
cheap oil and antagonizing the West and its allies, they are serving
China's purposes. But at least for now, Beijing looks unlikely to back
either of its supposed partners if they jeopardize China's interest in
stability or its extensive and profitable relations with the West.

#### The axis fails, economic tensions hinder cooperation

**Dubien 24** (Arnaud Dubien is an Associate Research Fellow at IRIS,
specialised in Russia and CIS, he also graduated from the Institut
national des langues et civilisations orientales and the Institut
d'études politiques de Paris, *Russia won't be China's vassal*, Le Monde
diplomatique, March 2024)
\[https://mondediplo.com/2024/03/08russia-china\]//rich

Russia's 'no limits' partnership with China -- as it was described when
President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing in February 2022 -- is under
close scrutiny in the West. France's president Emmanuel Macron expressed
the prevailing view among Western observers and decision-makers when he
told the French daily L'Opinion last May that Russia was effectively
becoming 'a sort of vassal state to China'. They think [[Russia's
international isolation]{.mark} since [invading Ukraine]{.mark} has
[**forced** it]{.mark} [into]{.mark} an unequal
**[pseudo-alliance]{.mark}** or rapprochement [with China]{.mark},
meaning greater dependence on its powerful and intractable eastern
neighbour.]{.underline}

The Kremlin sees things differently. [There are indeed [signs]{.mark}
[of **frustration** over economic issues]{.mark}, such as the
[**timidity** of Chinese high-tech companies]{.mark} and slow progress
of negotiations [on the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline]{.mark}, which
will [deliver 50 billion cubic metres of gas]{.mark} per year from the
Yamal Peninsula to China.]{.underline} And since Nikita Khrushchev's
split with Mao Zedong in the late 1950s, Russian leaders have never
talked of the relationship in terms of an alliance; that was out of the
question for two sovereign nuclear powers. Rather than an 'eternal
friendship' (which only endured for a decade last time around), they
prefer the more sober term 'strategic partnership'.

Nevertheless, this partnership, established in 1996 and confirmed by a
friendship treaty in 2001, has become a key element of Russia's 'pivot
to the East'. It has grown steadily stronger since Russia annexed Crimea
in 2014, and especially since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
As the world 'de-Westernises', the Kremlin is more and more certain that
it has taken the right path. It believes that China has no interest in
seeing Russia defeated in Ukraine and that, unlike the West, Beijing
doesn't want to interfere in its internal affairs, let alone change its
political model.

Bilateral trade, long the weak point in Russo-Chinese relations, is
growing rapidly. It rose from \$64bn in 2016 to \$190bn in 2022 and a
record \$240bn in 2023. China has been Russia's largest trading partner
since 2022, overtaking the EU (China-EU trade is expected to fall below
\$100bn this year). While the G7 nations have officially stopped imports
of Russian oil, China has doubled its own and, with India, is playing a
key role in keeping the Kremlin afloat.

The Kremlin is more and more certain that it has taken the right path.
It believes that China has no interest in seeing Russia defeated in
Ukraine

There have also been qualitative changes in the relationship. Russia's
strategic priority of de-dollarising foreign trade has reached record
levels in the case of China. According to Russian prime minister Mikhail
Mishustin, 90% of bilateral trade is now conducted in Chinese or Russian
currency. Mishustin visited China twice in 2023, and his involvement,
even more than two presidential visits only a few months apart (Xi
Jinping travelled to Moscow in March, Putin to Beijing in October),
signals that the partnership is becoming established.

Banking is now key to integration

The banking sector plays a key role in the economic integration of the
two countries. Most Russian banks are subject to Western sanctions and
have been cut off from the SWIFT international payments system (based in
Brussels); 30 of them now use China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment
System (CIPS). In 2022 alone, the exposure of four of China's biggest
banks (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China
Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China) to Russia's banking
sector quadrupled.

Chinese automakers are rapidly replacing Western firms that have pulled
out of Russia, such as Renault and Volkswagen. They now run 46% of
dealerships in Russia and are starting to build vehicles locally. This
vigorous trade relationship is encouraged by the two governments:
Mishustin's visit to Shanghai last May confirmed that all Russia's
oligarchs and its biggest business groups -- not just the 'China lobby'
of Rosneft (oil), Rusal (aluminium) and Sibur (petrochemicals) -- are
looking for opportunities in the East.

Though China is not shipping arms to Russia, it does seem to be making a
significant contribution to its war effort. US intelligence services
report that Russia has been importing large quantities of semiconductors
via Hong Kong-based companies. During the first year of the war,
12 million Chinese drones were shipped to Russia, as well as components
for radar systems and jamming antennae (via an Uzbek intermediary). A
company based in Shanghai helped supply 100,000 bulletproof vests and
100,000 helmets. And official statistics show that China's exports of
ceramics -- widely used in personal protective equipment -- have grown
by 69% in recent months, while shipments to Ukraine have fallen by 61%.

The picture is not entirely rosy: negotiations on the Power of Siberia 2
pipeline have yet to be concluded. Putin and Alexander Novak, deputy
prime minister in charge of energy, like to project confidence that it
will be completed by the end of the decade given China's need for gas.
The existing Power of Siberia 1 pipeline carries 38 billion cubic metres
per year from Yakutia to northeast China.

With the Power of Siberia 2 project, launched by Russia's Gazprom and
the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) in December 2019,
Russia's gas export strategy, formerly focused on Europe, began to look
east. Exports to China are now vital to Gazprom, which lost most of its
European market share following the explosions (that no one has yet
claimed responsibility for) which damaged the Nord Stream 1 and 2
pipelines, causing many of its customers to switch to other suppliers.
But Beijing's tough negotiating stance confirms that sentiment has no
place in this relationship.

Have Western sanctions failed?

[The notion that there is a [Sino-Russian Arctic alliance]{.mark} is a
[**misinterpretation** of]{.mark} the [realities that drive China and
Russia together in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}

While mutually beneficial interests -- and the overall sense of
'win-win' agreements -- [facilitate close engagement between Beijing and
Moscow in the Arctic, it is still [**problematic** to assume]{.mark} an
[Arctic **'axis'**]{.mark} **is forthcoming**.]{.underline} China's
[efforts to [increase its engagement in the Arctic]{.mark} are
[occurring far **beyond** the Russian Arctic Zone]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Iceland was the first European state to sign a free-trade agreement with
Beijing, and [[China's]{.mark} first [intergovernmental
framework]{.mark} in the [Arctic]{.mark} was [struck with Iceland in
2012]{.mark}. Various Chinese state energy interests have been floated
in geothermal resources in Iceland -- but to date the projects have been
abandoned.]{.underline} In 2018, the China--Iceland Arctic Science
Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland strategically
presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key shipping port
between Europe and Asia along the NSR. It seems clear that Chinese
Arctic strategy is to 'internationalise' the Arctic in a way that
features and promotes China's strategic benefit.

China is also driven by great power ideology and the prestige afforded
by having a global polar footprint. Russia is aware of this simmering
rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy. [Efforts by China to move beyond
the agreed terms of its mutually beneficial arrangement with Moscow
within the Russian Arctic Zone, and **how closely [China
adheres]{.mark}** [to the existing legal and sovereign arrangements
of]{.mark} the [Arctic Ocean]{.mark}, will certainly be a [**litmus
test** for the Sino-Russian Arctic 'alliance']{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, Sino-Russian strategic tensions remain, well beyond the
overhanging fear of centuries of mistrust and the issue of the Russian
Far East. In June 2020, Moscow accused one of its leading Arctic
scientists, Valery Mitko, of spying for Beijing. Mitko was charged with
treason for handing over classified information on Arctic research and
submarine sensor technology to China. But perhaps more telling is the
way that both countries have hushed up the incident, with neither
formally commenting on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow appear to
agree to disagree -- so long as Arctic LNG business is booming.

The narrative of Moscow and Beijing working together to carve up the
Arctic riches and take control of new global transport corridors has
started to make its way into the policy and defence planning documents
of Arctic-rim states. Washington's litany of Arctic strategic planning
documents -- Naval, Air Force and Coast Guard strategies -- feature
renewed great power competition in the Arctic as a central security
threat. [However, the notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic
alliance is a misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and
Russia together in the Arctic.]{.underline}

The realities of the [[Sino-Russian relationship]{.mark} (dubbed by both
as [one of 'mutual benefit') in the Arctic]{.mark} is best
[grasped]{.mark} when the [limits of the partnership are
considered]{.mark}. There are, first and foremost, **[limits]{.mark}**
in terms of [geographical boundaries.]{.mark} The [R]{.mark}ussian
[A]{.mark}rctic [Z]{.mark}one is the lion's share of the Arctic region,
home to the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. The **Russian
Arctic Zone** is also the [**geographical 'limit'** of Sino-Russian
Arctic 'cooperation']{.mark} as well.]{.underline}

Of the eight members of the Arctic Council, Russia took the most
convincing to grant China its observer status in 2013. Moscow approved
membership, and with it, legitimacy, on the basis that [[Beijing]{.mark}
explicitly **[acknowledged]{.mark}** the [sovereignty of Arctic-rim
states]{.mark} and [reaffirmed its **commitment** to]{.mark} the [legal
architecture of the Arctic region]{.mark} -- the [UN Convention
on]{.mark} the [Law of the Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.mark} watches, [with]{.mark} tempered **[suspicion]{.mark}**,
Beijing's Arctic high sea missions and scientific research agenda in
what China sees as a global commons.]{.underline} Yet within the Russian
Arctic Zone, Russia welcomes Chinese engagement, but on Kremlin terms.
Since 2014, with Western sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea
and sustained aggression in Ukraine, Moscow has had a cashflow problem.

[Despite key economic strategic partnerships in the Russian Arctic,
[China]{.mark} is [busy **diversifying** itself throughout the
region]{.mark}. China is [actively engaging]{.mark} with [other
Arctic-rim powers]{.mark} and [has commercial ventures]{.mark},
investment plans and entrenched [soft-power strategies in
Norway]{.mark}, [Canada, Iceland and Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}through Greenland).

Despite mutually beneficial interests in the Arctic, commercial
realpolitik is at the heart of China and Russia\'s engagement in the
region

Russia's Arctic strategy is built on both economic security and frontier
border security objectives. The Sino-Russian relationship lends itself
to these economic security interests and ambitions, but it is less
effective at navigating Russia's Arctic 'siege mentality'. This is
largely because of the kind of increased interest and activity that
China is undertaking in the Arctic -- and against which Russia seeks to
secure its vast open frontier. Any deterioration in Sino-Russian ties
could threaten this delicate balance.

[[Russian efforts to securitise]{.mark} its [economic interests]{.mark}
in the [Arctic **fall short**]{.mark} **of an [expansionist]{.mark}**
[agenda]{.mark}. Beyond the posturing, ultimately [Moscow's Arctic
priority]{.mark} remains [regional stability.]{.mark} Continued regional
cooperation with its NATO-member and Western Arctic neighbours remains a
central strategic objective.]{.underline} After all, keeping the arena
free of conflict is crucial to ensuring the NSR (and Russia's future
economic resource base) remains open and commercially viable. Russia
needs to be able to deliver secure, trusted and unimpeded energy
supplies from its northern frontier to Asian and European energy
clients.

The same cannot be assumed of Chinese Arctic interests, with clear
indicators of an emerging expansionist agenda. While much of Beijing's
recent Arctic Ocean missions have been primarily about 'raising the
flag' and promoting soft-power public relations campaigns for domestic
consumption, it is evident that China is set to stay in the Arctic.
While much of the Arctic Ocean is delineated by territorial seas and
agreed maritime boundaries, the central Arctic Ocean does hold
international waters, which facilitates Chinese engagement.

[[Fragmentation of Sino-Russian relations]{.mark} in [the Arctic]{.mark}
context [might]{.mark} yet [emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic
continental shelf debate]{.mark}. Via the UN Commission on the Limits of
the Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted
formal, yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf.]{.underline}
Should a claim be upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive
rights to the seabed and the resources beneath the area of the North
Pole. This would block China's access to seabed or resources in the
international Arctic waters around the North Pole.

Overall, [continued [efforts to put Moscow and Beijing in the same
'basket']{.mark} when it comes to [great power competition]{.mark} in
the Arctic 'great game' is [short-sighted and **misses critical
opportunities**]{.mark} to [futureproof the Arctic]{.mark} as a [zone of
international cooperation]{.mark}, collaboration and **[low
tension]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Sino-Russian Arctic ties will continue
to be predictable to a large extent. Ties will remain mutually
beneficial -- until they are not. Predicting this point should be the
priority for Arctic stakeholders. The problem appears to be, for now,
that many stakeholders assume a fractured or fragmented Sino-Russian
Arctic relationship does not exist.

[[Russia]{.mark} and [China's Arctic relationship]{.mark} is [**not an
alliance** --]{.mark} it is [driven by 'win-win' thinking]{.mark}. Such
framing is [extremely subjective and **prone to
change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite mutually beneficial interests in
the region, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of their engagement[.
For now, the partnership in the Arctic navigates existing fault lines
elsewhere, such as [Beijing's failure to acknowledge Russia's annexation
of Crimea]{.mark} and [Moscow's nonalignment in the developing
India--China conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Sino-Russian mutually beneficial cooperation and engagement within the
Russian Arctic Zone is not a Sino-Russian alliance in the Arctic. In a
somewhat Confucius-informed position, Beijing wants to 'seek harmony and
keep differences' when it comes to engagement with Russia in the Arctic.
[Both countries will remain engaged proactively and collaboratively
across industrialization projects, diplomatic relations and various
commercial dealings in the Russian Arctic Zone. But when this 'win-win'
situation sours, Western Arctic states may indeed be faced with another
Arctic security threat -- a **conflict** between Russia and China in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Exploration in the Barents Sea,"

Greaker was picked out to witness on the case because of his long
history of climate research. He argues that there are a series of errors
and misleading presentations in the Impact Assessment for Petroleum
Exploration in the Barents Sea.

\- [The Impact [Assessment]{.mark} with its underlying reports **[forms
an insufficient]{.mark}ly worked-through [foundation]{.mark}** for the
decision to award licenses]{.underline} and opening the 23rd round of
licences in the Barents Sea, says Greaker. He is Head of Research at
Statistics Norway and holds a PhD in Social Economics.

The Norwegian Storting (parliament) discussed the issue of opening the
southeastern parts of the Barents Sea for oil exploration on 19 June
2013, following an impact assessment, and said yes to the government's
recommendation that the area be opened up for such exploration. Greaker
refers to a report worked out for Greenpeace and Young Friends of the
Earth prior to the climate lawsuit.

\- [There were **[many]{.mark} and in part grave [errors]{.mark} and
flaws in the assessment**]{.underline}. [Among others, [no present value
analysis]{.mark} is conducted, [costs related to CO2]{.mark} emissions
from activities [are not taken into account]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[employment]{.mark} effect [is overrated]{.mark}]{.underline}, he writes
in a report he has co-authored together with researcher Knut Einar
Rosendahl.

**[Ignores environmental consequences]{.underline}**

In addition, [the report states that [petroleum]{.mark} activities in
the southeastern parts of the Barents Sea will involve a series of
effects for the climate, **[effects]{.mark} to which private petroleum
[companies pay]{.mark} rather [little regard]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\- [This [applies]{.mark} a.o. **[to]{.mark} the [effect]{.mark} that
[uncontrolled emissions have]{.mark} on the climate**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} also that of global [petroleum consumption]{.mark}
increasing]{.underline}, the scientist writes.

In their report, [the scientists conclude that an [exhaustive
cost-benefit analysis should be conducted]{.mark} in order to know
whether or not petroleum activities can be expected to be socio-economic
profitable]{.underline}.

\- [Such an [analysis should contain]{.mark} an [assessment of future
climate gas costs]{.mark}, oil and gas price risks and cost excess
risks]{.underline}, Greaker concludes.
