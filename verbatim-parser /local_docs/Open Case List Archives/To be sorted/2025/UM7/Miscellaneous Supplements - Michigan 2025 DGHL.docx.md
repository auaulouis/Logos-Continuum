#### Degrowth can't solve climate change. 

Matt **Huber '23**, Professor of Geography at Syracuse, "The Problem
with Degrowth", Jacobin, 07-16-2023,
https://jacobin.com/2023/07/degrowth-climate-change-economic-planning-production-austerity.

The environmental perspective of degrowth is gaining traction. A couple
months ago the European Union parliament held a multiday conference
"Beyond Growth" featuring many speakers aligned with the perspective.
Liberal environmentalist Bill McKibben offered a sympathetic
assessment in the New Yorker.

Degrowth is even making inroads on the socialist left. Two years ago the
Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung in New York City published an article, "Degrowth
and Revolutionary Organizing." A major book, The Future Is Degrowth,
was favorably reviewed in Democratic Socialists of America's
journal Socialist Forum. In Japan, the ecological Marxist Kohei Saito
has sold five hundred thousand copies of a book laying out a case for
degrowth communism (the volume, titled Slow Down: The Degrowth
Manifesto, will be released in an English translation early next year).

And now one of the oldest journals on the socialist left, the Monthly
Review --- its first issue in 1949 included "Why Socialism?" by Albert
Einstein --- has fully embraced degrowth. It's latest issue is entitled
"Planned Degrowth: Ecosocialism and Sustainable Human Development" and
features many of the most prominent degrowth proponents, such as Jason
Hickel and Matthias Schmelzer. The issue also includes a long
introduction by the long-standing ecological Marxist John Bellamy
Foster. As usual for a Foster essay, there is much thought provoking and
worth agreeing with in it. But ultimately, like much of the degrowth
movement, it [needlessly shackles]{.underline} its [vision
of]{.underline} a [socialist future to]{.underline} a [program of
aggregate reduction.]{.underline}

We all can agree with some aspects of Foster's proposals: first, we want
to shift to an economy that prioritizes ecological sustainability and
provisioning human needs. We want an economy that produces for "use
value" against capitalism's focus on profit and exchange value.

Indeed, degrowth proponents and Foster are correct to reject our
society's fixation on gross domestic product (GDP) as the indicator of
economic health. GDP ultimately fixates on exchange value regardless of
whether it contributes to popular and environmental well-being.

Second, solving the ecological crisis requires a shift away from the
anarchy of the market under capitalism and toward planning. Most of our
ecological problems are rooted in fixed infrastructure investments ---
housing, transportation, the electricity grid --- that the market is
uniquely bad at provisioning. Restructuring such
systems requires planning.

It is on the question of the productive forces where Foster departs from
a standard Marxist position. Traditionally, Marxists argued that the
relations of private ownership and the profit motive inhibit or "fetter"
the full development of the productive forces, and only a transition to
socialism can allow us to fully develop the productive forces. Yet,
Foster says that while this might have been true in the nineteenth
century, we must reevaluate this proposition in light of the
twenty-first century ecological crisis:

\[T\]he context in which \[Marx and Engels\] were writing was not
today's "full-world economy," but rather a still early stage of
industrialization. In the period of industrial development, extending
from the beginning of the eighteenth century until the first Earth Day
in 1970, world industrial productive potential increased in size around
1,730 times, which from a nineteenth-century perspective, would have
seemed "a practically unlimited increase." Today, however, it raises the
issue of ecological "overshoot."

Foster then goes on to draw from Engels in saying, "the goal of
socialism was not the expansion of production itself, but rather the
'free development' of human beings." This is true. The goal is not
necessarily to increase production but to create the maximum conditions
for human freedom. But the reverse is also true: [the goal is not
necessarily to decrease aggregate production]{.underline}.

Nearly all degrowth proposals have some call for "aggregate" reductions
of "energy use" or "material throughput." For example, take this
from The Future Is Degrowth: "degrowth can be defined as the democratic
transition to a society that . . . is based on a much smaller throughput
of energy and resources."

What [Engels]{.underline} actually [calls for]{.underline} in the cited
passages from Anti-Dühring is for [society to take full social
control]{.underline} (planning) [over]{.underline} the social [relation
to nature]{.underline}, as opposed to capitalism, which cedes it to
anarchic markets. This [requires total flexibility to what must be grown
or degrown]{.underline}, and [not rigid adherence to aggregate
reductions]{.underline}.

More to the point, the climate crisis actually fits Marx's "fettering
thesis" quite well. It is entirely clear that [solving climate
change requires massive development of]{.underline} the [productive
forces]{.underline} --- productive forces that capital is specifically
reluctant to invest in.

For example, prominent modeling from Princeton University suggests that
zeroing emissions by 2050 will require, among other things, 80 to120
million heat pumps, up to five times an increase in electricity
transmission capacity, 250 large nuclear reactors (or 3,800 small ones),
and the development of whole new industry --- carbon capture and
sequestration --- from scratch.

This is why socialists argue that it will require a massive social
effort of public investment and planning to accomplish this. In other
words, [we need entirely different social relations of production to
fully develop the productive forces necessary]{.underline} for our
historical crisis.

But, even if we look beyond the ecological crisis, at [the core of the
socialist project is]{.underline} the aim [to abolish class itself
and]{.underline} the widespread [poverty]{.underline} that afflicts
humans all over the planet (even in "rich countries" like the United
States). Imagine what it would take to give the entire planet public
housing, public transit, reliable electricity, and modern water-sewage
services. Now [imagine trying to achieve this while]{.underline}
also [shrinking aggregate material resource use]{.underline}. To say the
least, this sounds like [a difficult task]{.underline}.

Overall, it would be quite sad to build a socialist movement capable of
seizing the means of production only to prohibit from the outset the
further development of the productive forces. Socialism is not stasis.
What about fusion power? Curing cancer? We still have so much left to
accomplish as a species that capitalism might be holding us back from.

Of course, degrowthers say that the reason we need aggregate reductions
is because the crisis is rooted in "the crossing of planetary
boundaries" (not just climate change, but others such as biodiversity
and freshwater resources). Foster writes: "Science has established
without a doubt that, in today's 'full-world economy,' it is necessary
to operate within an overall Earth System budget with respect to
allowable physical throughput." Oddly, this sweeping claim is backed up
by a citation to a nearly twenty-year-old paper by an advocate of
immigration and population control, Herman Daly.

But as soon as the concept of fixed planetary boundaries was proposed,
it was hotly debated and critiqued by scientists of various stripes.
And, even if we accept that the science on these boundaries is fixed and
settled, it is not at all clear that the answer to many of them is
degrowth or aggregate reductions. Again, the [solution to climate change
requires at least initially a massive expansion of production and
infrastructure investment.]{.underline}

One of the boundaries --- stratospheric ozone depletion --- has
basically already been addressed by a simple technological switch
initiated by the 1987 Montreal Protocol. Overall, [addressing
each]{.underline} of the [boundaries is complex]{.underline} and [calls
for]{.underline} more [contextual qualitative transformations
of]{.underline} specific [sectors]{.underline} of production, [rather
than]{.underline} some abstract or [generalized commitment to
degrowth]{.underline}.

Degrowth advocates push back against accusations of eco-austeritybecause
they, as Foster does, call for the decommodification of basic human
needs. Indeed, this should be every socialist's core demand to mitigate
the insecurity and indignity of market dependence under capitalism.

Yet Foster's essay shows that degrowth is a kind of austerity in its
original meaning: a fiscal commitment to budgetary restraint.
[Degrowth]{.underline} is not advocating for cutting actual government
budgets, but the [language of accounting and restrictions
pervades]{.underline} the [discourse]{.underline}.

Foster equates degrowth with "net-zero capital formation," invokes
something called an "Earth-system budget," and claims, "\[c\]ontinued
growth would occur in some areas of the economy, made possible by
reductions elsewhere." Whereas governments must balance budgets in
monetary terms, degrowthers rely on equally abstract quantitative
concepts like "[material throughput]{.underline}."

However, this concept, like GDP itself, would [not]{.underline} be a
[useful proxy for ecological progress]{.underline}. As Kenta Tsuda put
it, its [crudest measures fail to ascertain]{.underline} "the
[differential ecological harms of materials]{.underline}, for example,
that of a mercury-infused coal ash pile and an equal mass of food scraps
in a compost bin."

Overall, a quantitative commitment to "net zero capital formation" would
usher in an austerity mindset throughout all of society, where all
increases must be balanced out. It is one thing to advance a strategic
critique of degrowth: In a capitalist system defined by deprivation, who
will support a program centering reduction? But its other problem is
that it seeks to place de facto constraints on our future political
programs. The point of socialism, however, is to unleash human potential
from the shackles of capitalism and its market imperatives.

There is of course a possibility that if we seized the means of
production, science could inform a collective determination that it is
necessary to "degrow" in some way, but why would we make this a
prerequisite of our program and foreclose that democratic determination?

Foster's essay contains many other strange claims --- including the
suggestion that "labor itself might be substituted for fossil-fuel
energy," a [proposal]{.underline} that [would condemn us to]{.underline}
a more [labor-intensive economy of drudgery]{.underline} --- but at its
core, Foster's [degrowth]{.underline} socialism is yet [another attempt
to dress up post-1960s environmental ideology in Marxist
clothing]{.underline}.

Foster ends by citing the political economist Paul Baran's call for
socialism as a "planned economic surplus," only to insist that
ecological necessities might force a "reduction in the economic
surplus." But Baran's concept sounds useful. Socialism will require a
surplus: the question is, what we do with it? Planning the surplus with
ecological goals in mind is something that capitalism is uniquely bad
at. Socialism can do better.

#### Degrowth is an 'abject fantasy', a political death knell, can't solve climate change, and green growth solves. 

Noah **Smith '21**, Number 2 blogger in Business on Substack, former
economics columnist for Bloomberg Opinion and former assistant finance
professor for Stony Brook University, "People are realizing that
degrowth is bad", Substack, 09-06-2021,
https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth.

I was going to write a lengthy post explaining why "degrowth" --- the
idea that we need to halt economic growth in order to save the planet
--- is a very bad idea. But in the meantime, other people have written
that post, or recorded that podcast, and done it well. These
include Branko Milanovic, Kelsey Piper, and Ezra Klein. So instead I'll
write a shorter post trying to catalog and boil down the arguments
against degrowth.

But first, let's go over the standard argument, so we can see why these
new arguments are necessary.

The standard argument against degrowth 

First, note that the typical argument against degrowth, which I laid out
in a Bloomberg post a while back, is that we don't need it; [we can
raise human living standards without exhausting the planet]{.underline}.
This argument was capably put forward by Andy McAfee, in his excellent
book More From Less, which you should buy and read. Essentially, [the
idea that economic growth requires growth in resource use is
false]{.underline}; [rich countries have started to grow while using
less]{.underline} and less [of the planet's]{.underline} most important
[resources]{.underline}. For example, here is U.S. use of fresh water
and various metals, as well as trade-adjusted carbon emissions:

So the idea here is that we don't need degrowth; instead, [we can keep
raising everyone's standard of living without exhausting the planet's
resources]{.underline}. Because [growth]{.underline} doesn't just mean
using more and more stuff; instead, it [can mean finding more efficient
ways to use the stuff we have]{.underline}.

Degrowthers have two counters to this. Their first counter, typically,
is to show a graph of resource use for the entire world, and show that
it's correlated with global growth. This is a weak response, for two
reasons:

Degrowthers have no idea how to combine various resources into an
overall measure of resource use, so they typically go with [gross
weight]{.underline}. This [is absurd, since some materials are
recyclable and others are not]{.underline} --- if you "use" a ton of
copper you still have the copper, whereas if you "use" a ton of oil,
your oil is gone. It's [also]{.underline} absurd [because it doesn't
take into account the relative abundance of resources]{.underline} ---
if you figure out how to substitute 2 tons of sand for 1 ton of oil,
you're getting more efficient, since sand is much more plentiful than
oil (and doesn't pollute as much when you use it). A lot of growth is
figuring out how to substitute plentiful resources for rare ones, and
simply adding up gross tonnage ignores this.

[Past trends are no guarantee of future trends]{.underline}. Until the
70s, for instance, U.S. economic growth was closely correlated with both
energy use and carbon emissions; after the 70s, this correlation broke
down completely and the lines started moving in opposite directions.
[Degrowthers present historical curves]{.underline} as if these are
[laws of nature, but]{.underline} we know that [they are
not]{.underline}. The trend is your friend only til the bend at the end.
And the fact that rich countries have hit an inflection point where
economic growth no longer depends on growing resource use is a strong
indicator that industrializing countries like China will also hit this
point as well. (And no, [falling use in rich countries is]{.underline}
mostly [not due to outsourcing]{.underline}, as the emissions graph
above illustrates.)

So this degrowther argument is just wrong. But degrowthers have a
second, far better counter to McAfee's notion that we can have our cake
and eat it too: Decoupling isn't happening fast enough. If we wait for
China and India and all the countries of Africa to industrialize in a
resource-intensive way like today's developed countries did, and then to
dematerialize their growth like today's developed countries are doing
now, it will be far too late and the planet will suffer ecological
catastrophe. 

This argument isn't as strong as it sounds --- [China and India and the
rest will be able to take advantage of the efficiency-inducing
technologies created by the developed countries]{.underline}, like solar
power (indeed, they are already doing so). And [they will be able to
embrace "dematerialized" goods and services like social networks and
video games]{.underline} (sorry, Xi Jinping) very early in their growth
path. So these countries' resource use trajectories won't look quite
like the U.S.' or Europe's.

But this degrowther argument does contain a nugget of truth: Global
resource use is currently on an unsustainable trajectory. Here, via Zeke
Hausfather, are the current projections for global warming by century's
end, even with the advances in techologies like solar:

So even if there is a sustainable growth path, we are not currently on
it. About this, degrowthers are right; a gentle, natural transition to
green growth is possible, but is an unaffordable luxury. But
[degrowthers' prescription is the wrong one. ]{.underline}

The reason, in a word, is politics. The kind of [massive intention
reordering]{.underline} of global production and consumption that
degrowthers fantasize about is not just pragmatically impossible to
implement, it's [the]{.underline} kind of [thing]{.underline} that
essentially [everyone in the world]{.underline} except for a few very
shouty people in Northern Europe and the occasional Twitter activist [is
going to reject]{.underline}. To see why, let us turn to the excellent
articles/podcasts by Milanovic, Piper, and Klein. 

Milanovic actually has two excellent posts on the topic of degrowth.
In the first one, he lays out why forcing developing countries to stay
in poverty would be bad:

Let us suppose, for the sake of the argument, that we interpret
"degrowth" as the decision to fix global GDP at its current
level...Then, unless we change the distribution of income, we are
condemning to permanent abject poverty some 15 percent of world
population that currently earn less than \$1.90 per day and some quarter
of humankind who earn less than \$2.50 per day...Keeping so many people
in abject poverty so that the rich can continue to enjoy their current
standard of living is obviously something that the proponents of
degrowth would not condone.  

[Enforcing global degrowth would require freezing world income at about
\$17,000/year]{.underline}. That means that [most people in the world
would never]{.underline} even [come close to current rich-world living
standards]{.underline} --- instead, [they would at best only be able to
reach]{.underline} the [level]{.underline} currently enjoyed [in China
or Botswana]{.underline}. Perhaps that's not such a horrible fate, but
as Milanovic notes, [this would require impoverishing most of the
population of developed countries]{.underline}. He elaborates on this
point in his new post, pulling no punches: 

\[In order to avoid keeping most of the world in poverty, degrowthers
must\] introduce a different \[income\] distribution (B) where everybody
who is above the current mean world income (\$PPP 16  per day) is driven
down to this mean, and the poor countries and people are,  at least for
a while, allowed to continue growing until they too achieve the level of
\$PPP 16 per day. But the problem with that approach is that one would
have to engage in a massive reduction of incomes for...practically all
of the Western population. Only 14% of the population in Western
countries live at the level of income less than the global
mean...Degrowers thus [need to convince 86% of the
population]{.underline} living [in rich countries that their incomes are
too high]{.underline} and need to be reduced....It is quite obvious that
such a [proposition is a political suicide.]{.underline}

Milanovic quite rightly waves away degrowthers' protestations that GDP
is not a good measure of human welfare. GDP isn't perfect, he notes, but
it's close enough where the basic point stands. 

Demanding that people in rich countries accept absolutely catastrophic
declines in their living standards is a political non-starter. Klein, on
his podcast, tries to point this out as gently as possible:

I think that if the political demand of the \[degrowth\] movement
becomes you don't get to eat beef, you will set climate politics back so
far, so fast, it would be disastrous. Same thing with S.U.V.s. I don't
like S.U.V.s. I don't drive one. But [if you are telling people in rich
countries that the climate movement is for them not having the cars they
want to have, you are just going to lose. You are going to lose
fast]{.underline}...This is where the politics of \[degrowth\] for me
fall apart...

I just don't see the argument for [degrowth]{.underline} as being
anything but [an extraordinarily slower way of approaching the
politics]{.underline}, probably counterproductive compared to what we're
doing, which is I think [you can make]{.underline} tremendous [strides
on climate change]{.underline} [by deploying renewable]{.underline}
energy [tech]{.underline}nologies and giving people the opportunity to
have a more materially fulfilling life atop those technologies.

Milanovic is less gentle, calling this "outright magical thinking". He
is correct. When you look at how much people in America are willing to
sacrifice in terms of their material well-being in order to fight
climate change, it's far less than what Klein is talking about. And
Klein is really softballing it here --- it's not just giving up beef and
SUVs, it's a [dramatic reduction in the size of housing and the amount
of food and the ease of transportation and the quality of medical
care]{.underline} that people in rich countries enjoy. It
[is]{.underline}, frankly, [not happening]{.underline}.

But even this vastly understates the political and practical
difficulties of degrowth. Piper adds several key points. First of all,
she notes, because developed countries have been decoupling resource use
and growth for a while now, curbing resource use will actually cause a
lot more restrictions on developing countries than Milanovic's simple
calculations would suggest:

From a climate change perspective, though, there's a problem \[with
simply reducing rich-world living standards\]. First, it means that
[degrowth would do nothing about the bulk of
emissions]{.underline}, which are occurring in developing countries. 

This is an incredibly important point. For example, China now produces
more CO2 emissions than the U.S., the EU, and Japan combined:

(And no, this is [not because of outsourcing]{.underline}, as you can
see by looking at the trade-adjusted emissions numbers.)

Another way of looking at this is that China's CO2 emissions per dollar
of GDP are more than twice America's, and about five times that of the
EU. Any [global degrowth]{.underline} plan that actually reduces
resource use is [going to entail]{.underline} more [pain for
China]{.underline} than its GDP numbers would suggest, simply because
China is at a more resource-intensive stage of growth.

Do you think China will accept a substantial diminution of its living
standards, in order to satisfy the environmental-economic diktats of
activists in Northern Europe? If so, you need to rethink a great many
things.

Anyway, Piper makes a second crucially important point. So far we've
been waving our hands and talking about lowering rich-world GDP while
raising GDP for poor countries. In fact, economies don't work like that:

Second, the [global economy is more interconnected than Hickel
implies]{.underline}. When Covid-19 hit, [poor countries were
devastated]{.underline} not just by the virus but [by the aftershocks of
virus-induced slowdowns in consumption in rich countries]{.underline}.

There's some genuine appeal to the idea of an end to "consumerism," but
the [pandemic offered a taste of how a sudden drop in rich-world
consumption would actually affect the developing world]{.underline}.
Covid-19 dramatically curtailed Western imports and tourism for a time.
The [consequences in poor countries were devastating. Hunger rose, and
child mortality followed]{.underline}.

Degrowth would thus require deep changes in the entire way that the
global economy works. Change happens, but not like that; implementing
the kind of reallocation schemes that degrowthers throw around with
abandon would require global economic planning that would put Gosplan to
shame. Klein points this out, again rather gently:

[Degrowth is]{.underline}, as its advocates understand it, a act of
global economic planning really without equal anywhere in human history.
It is an act of extraordinary central planning. 

In other words, it is [abject fantasy]{.underline}. 

Taken together, these criticisms are utterly devastating to the entire
degrowth project. In its current form, it will not advance beyond a
media fad. No matter how shrilly degrowthers quote apocalyptic
projections, the things they call for simply will not happen. 

Luckily, there is a better way to save the planet. And there is a better
role for the degrowth movement, if they're willing to rethink their
approach and become more fact-based, reasonable, and humble.

Degrowth is a non-starter, and green growth won't happen fast enough on
its own. Thus, the world has only [one viable
option]{.underline}: [Forced green growth]{.underline}. Government
policy will have to accelerate the transition to green energy and
dematerialized GDP faster than these transitions would otherwise take
place. For climate, this will involve things like:

A forced rapid transition to green electricity

Forced rapid electrification of most energy use

The forced rapid adoption of low-emissions heat for industrial processes

Forced restriction of deforestation

...and so on. 

For other resources, governments must act to avert the "tragedy of the
commons". For example, most of the plastic that gets dumped into our
oceans is dumped by a few developing countries. These countries have to
curb this practice, and bury the plastic like rich countries do. 

In addition, even when the tragedy of the commons doesn't exist,
countries need to manage their natural resources in a far-sighted way.
The U.S., for instance, has done a lot of this with land conservation,
but failed to do this with respect to aquifers. Governments have to be
more far-sighted than their citizens, saving resources for future
generations instead of letting the current generation consume
everything.

All of this requires planning. Lots of planning! But
[infinitely less planning than degrowthers' schemes]{.underline} to
reallocate global consumption and regulate the consumption of each
commodity. Rapid decarbonization, curbing of global pollution, and
resource conservation are tall orders, politically and logistically
speaking, but unlike degrowth, they are possible.

And degrowthers might actually have a constructive role to play in this
process --- if they want it. Instead of focusing on reducing growth,
they need to focus on reducing consumption. To those who haven't thought
deeply about economics, those two things might sound like the same thing
--- aren't degrowthers already trying to curb consumption? But here's
the key difference: [We need to curb consumption in order to
boost investment. ]{.underline}

Making a rapid transition to green, sustainable growth will require huge
new investments. Many environmentalists --- for example, the people who
wrote the Green New Deal --- understand this. We need to build out huge
amounts of solar power, wind, and storage; retool buildings for electric
power and industrial processes for hydrogen gas; build out fleets of
electric vehicles to replace internal combustion; build trains and dense
housing and so on; and invest in new technologies like tissue-culture
meat. 

This is an absolutely enormous economic undertaking, and it is economic
growth. It will require delaying some consumption so that the next
generation can enjoy both higher standards of living and a more
sustainable planet. But crucially, it [represents delaying consumption,
rather than permanently reducing consumption]{.underline}. That's the
[big difference between green growth and degrowth]{.underline}.

People are willing to delay consumption for a brighter future. Rapidly
industrializing countries, with their high savings and investment rates
and low ratios of consumption to GDP, do this all the time. But it
requires political will and buy-in. People need to know that they're not
impoverishing themselves, they're just delaying gratification --- being
the ants instead of the grasshopper. 

Degrowthers could play a part in creating this popular buy-in, but only
if they substantially change their message. Instead of "consume less",
their message should be "consume less today, so you can consume more
tomorrow". After all, at its core, isn't that what sustainability is
about?

Unfortunately, I'm pessimistic about the degrowth movement switching to
a Green New Deal sort of investment-oriented framework. At its core, I
feel like degrowth's appeal comes from its implicit promise to recast
genteel North European decline as some sort of grandiose world-saving
moral quest. That's an itch that no Green New Deal will scratch.

But in any case, the rest of the environmental movement --- and the
political Left in general --- must realize that [degrowth,]{.underline}
as currently formulated[, is a non-starter]{.underline}. [There are
crusades]{.underline} out there [worth fighting for]{.underline}; [this
is not one of them]{.underline}.

#### Capitalism is alive and well, even within youth populations-- reject individualized claims of socialist fervor for certain politicians. 

Adam **Millsap '23**, Senior fellow working on economic issues at Stand
Together Trust, "New Report Shows Capitalism Still Popular and That's a
Good Thing", Forbes, 05-02-2023,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2023/05/02/new-report-shows-capitalism-still-popular-and-thats-a-good-thing/.

To paraphrase Mark Twain, the [reports of capitalism's death are greatly
exaggerated]{.underline}. [For years, we have been told support for
socialism is overtaking capitalism, especially among younger
generations]{.underline}. While there is a kernel of truth behind such
statements, a [recent report shows that support for the key aspects of
capitalism is still strong]{.underline}.

In a report published by the Center for the Study of Capitalism at Wake
Forest University, authors Christina Elson and Kylie King examine how
well people think capitalism is working. They asked a representative
sample of 1,600 Americans aged 18 and older to answer various questions
about capitalism and America's economy. They call their headline finding
the Capitalism Satisfaction Barometer and it is modeled on the Net
Promoter Score (NPS) methodology commonly used by marketers.

The idea is that folks who strongly support capitalism as the best
economic system for America (rate it a 9 or 10) are likely to promote
it, while modest supporters (7 or 8) are likely to be more neutral.
Folks who give capitalism low scores (1 through 6) are labeled
detractors. The scores are aggregated to create a net score between -100
and 100, with negative scores indicating overall dissatisfaction with
capitalism and positive scores signaling overall satisfaction. According
to the report, the [NPS for capitalism is -29, indicating modest
dissatisfaction]{.underline}.

[But]{.underline} wait, I said [capitalism is still
popular]{.underline}. Am I foolish? Perhaps. But a closer examination of
the report beyond the NPS reveals that in this case I am right.

Though only 48% of respondents are promoters of capitalism or neutral
about it, when asked whether they want the government to be more or less
involved in the economy, a [plurality of younger people]{.underline}
(45% of those aged 18 -- 41) [want less government and more
markets]{.underline}, while a [slight majority of older
folks]{.underline} (51% of those aged 42 and older) [do]{.underline}.
[Only 31% of younger folks and 23% of older folks want more state
intervention,]{.underline} as shown below.

So to the extent people are unhappy with capitalism in America, it is
[largely because they think it is not free-market enough]{.underline}.
This is hardly an endorsement of socialism.

Additionally, a [strong majority of every generation]{.underline}, even
the younger Gen Z and Millennial generations, [say they are likely to
support capitalism]{.underline}. In fact, the youngest generation, [Gen
Z, expressed a stronger inclination to support capitalism than
Millennials]{.underline}. The [trend of young people souring on
capitalism]{.underline}---if true in the first place---[seems to be
reversing]{.underline}

Even more telling is that both [older and younger respondents strongly
support key characteristics of capitalism]{.underline}. The survey asked
how important it is to allow individuals to own property, invest to earn
profits, decide what to do with earned profits, change jobs, bargain for
wages, and access credit for personal needs. These are all key features
of capitalism, a system of economic organization that relies on property
rights and voluntary exchange. Contrast that with socialism, which
emphasizes state ownership of businesses, discourages profit seeking,
and relies on government officials to set wages. As shown below, [at
least 80% of each age group think the key characteristics of capitalism
are important]{.underline}. Again, this hardly seems like a rejection of
capitalism. Instead, it [hints that people are unsure about the
definition of capitalism]{.underline}. Similar-sized majorities think it
is important for individuals to be able to start and own a business,
decide what kind of business to create, and set prices based on supply
and demand. These are [all critical features of capitalism, not
socialism]{.underline}.

[Widespread support for capitalism is a good thing]{.underline}. As the
economist Deirdre McCloskey and others have explained,
[capitalism]{.underline} at its best [promotes an honorable
life]{.underline}. Prudence, thrift, industriousness, risk-taking,
cooperation, and kindness are just a few of the virtues fostered by
capitalism. Capitalism empowers people to take control of their lives
and rewards people for the value they create for others. [Though not a
perfect system, it is significantly better than the
alternatives.]{.underline}

Some say they dislike capitalism, instead preferring some version of
socialism. [But when asked whether they support freer markets or more
government intervention, most choose freer markets]{.underline}.
Similarly, [large majorities support the key features of capitalism,
features that are inconsistent with socialism]{.underline}. Contrary to
the naysayers, [capitalism is alive and well, and we are all the better
for it]{.underline}.

### Perm\-\--Degrowth\-\--2AC

#### Perm: Do Both -- degrowth has to happen regardless of the plan, in order to save our planet. 

Mike **Joy '23**, Morgan Foundation Senior Research Fellow in Freshwater
Ecology and Environmental Science, "Critics of 'degrowth' economics say
it's unworkable, but from an ecologist's perspective, it's inevitable.",
The Conversation, 08-15-2023,
https://theconversation.com/critics-of-degrowth-economics-say-its-unworkable-but-from-an-ecologists-perspective-its-inevitable-211496.

You may not have noticed, but earlier this month we passed Earth
overshoot day, when humanity's demands for ecological resources and
services exceeded what our planet can regenerate annually. 

Many economists criticising the developing degrowth movement fail to
appreciate this critical point of Earth's biophysical limits. 

Ecologists on the other hand see the human economy as a subset of the
biosphere. Their perspective highlights the urgency with which we need
to reduce our demands on the biosphere to avoid a disastrous ecological
collapse, with consequences for us and all other species.

Many degrowth scholars (as well as critics) focus on features of
capitalism as the cause of this ecological overshoot. But while
capitalism may be problematic, many civilisations destroyed ecosystems
to the point of collapse long before it became our dominant economic
model.

Capitalism, powered by the availability of cheap and abundant fossil
energy, has indeed resulted in unprecedented and global biosphere
disruption. But the [direct cause]{.underline} remains the [excessive
volume and speed]{.underline} with [which resources are extracted and
wastes returned]{.underline} to the environment. 

From an ecologist's perspective, [degrowth is inevitable]{.underline} on
our current trajectory. 

Ecology tells us that many species overshoot their environment's
carrying capacity if they have temporary access to an unusually high
level of resources. Overshoot declines when those resources return to
more stable levels. This often involves large-scale starvation and
die-offs as populations adjust.

Access to fossil fuels has allowed us to temporarily overshoot
biophysical limits. This lifted our population and demands on the
biosphere past the level it can safely absorb. Barring a planned
reduction of those biosphere demands, [we will experience the same
"adjustments" as other species]{.underline}. 

One advantage humans have over other species is that [we understand
overshoot dynamics and can plan how we adjust]{.underline}. This is what
the degrowth movement is attempting to do.

To grasp the necessity of reducing ecological overshoot we must
understand its current status. We can do this by examining a variety of
empirical studies. 

Analysis of material flows in the economy shows [we are currently
extracting more than 100 billion tons]{.underline} of natural materials
annually, and rising. [This greatly exceeds natural
processes]{.underline} -- erosion, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes --
[that move materials around the globe]{.underline}. 

[Such massive human-driven material flows can destroy ecosystems, cause
pollution and drive species extinct. ]{.underline}

Only about [10% of these resource flows are]{.underline} potentially
[renewable]{.underline}. In many cases, we are harvesting more than can
be regenerated annually (for example, many fish stocks).

Humans have now transgressed at least six of nine planetary boundaries.
Each boundary has distinct limits, but in some instances the overshoot
is at least double the safe operating level.

Both material flow analysis and planetary boundaries provide critically
important information about our impacts on the biosphere. But they fail
to capture the full picture. The former doesn't directly measure
biosphere functioning. The latter doesn't capture inter-dependencies
between various boundaries.

The biosphere is a holistic entity, with many self-organising and
interconnected subsystems. Our generally reductionist scientific
methodologies are not able to capture this level of complexity. The
methodology that comes closest to achieving this is the ecological
footprint.

The ecological footprint measures the amount of productive surface on
Earth and its capacity to generate resources and assimilate waste. These
are two of the most fundamental features of the biosphere. 

It then compares this available biocapacity with humanity's annual
demands. Humanity's ecological footprint has exceeded the biosphere's
annual biocapacity since at least 1970 and is currently almost twice the
sustainable level.

The reason we can use more of what is generated annually is because we
use stored biomass -- ancient solar energy captured over millennia -- to
power this draw-down. 

We must note that the ecological footprint is an
acknowledged underestimate of our demands on the biosphere. Also, the
biosphere isn't there only for us. At least 30-50% of the
biosphere should be reserved as wilderness to protect other species and
global ecosystems. 

Humanity exceeds its fair share of natural resources by more than 50%,
and likely needs to reduce this demand by 70-80% to operate within
carrying capacity. Those with greater wealth are responsible for
a disproportionately large share of overshoot. 

The political and public concern about climate change is
considerable internationally and in New Zealand. But this is [one of
many environmental crises]{.underline}, together with soil erosion,
groundwater pollution, deforestation, the rise of invasive species,
biodiversity loss, ocean acidification and the depletion of resources.
They are [all symptoms of overshoot]{.underline}.

The climate crisis is seen as a problem requiring a solution rather than
a symptom of overshoot. The problem is generally formulated as looking
for a way to maintain current lifestyles in the wealthy world, rather
than reducing overshoot. 

The [ecological perspective accepts that we exceed biophysical
boundaries and emphasises the importance of reducing energy and material
consumption]{.underline} -- regardless of how the energy is provided. 

The [scope of human disruption of the biosphere is]{.underline} now
[global]{.underline}. This ecological perspective highlights the current
magnitude and closeness of significant and unwelcome changes to Earth
systems. [The reduction of humanity's demands on the biosphere is an
overriding priority]{.underline}.

Ecological economics, with its emphasis on a steady-state economy, is
perhaps the most rigorous existing economic framework with specific
proposals for determining priority actions. We urge scholars of all
disciples to examine these.

### Impact\-\--Democracy\-\--2AC

#### Socialism is corrupting -- regardless of intentions, it always leads to totalitarianism- every empiric proves. 

**Review Staff '22**, Cornell students, community members, and alumni
contribute to the Cornell Review, "Yes, Real Socialism Has Been Tried-
And It Has Failed Every Time", Cornell Review, 02-17-2022,
https://www.thecornellreview.org/yes-real-socialism-has-been-tried-and-it-has-failed-every-time/.

Over the past 100 years or so, [socialist experiments around the world
unleashed a vast tide of tyranny, starvation, and mass
murder]{.underline} on a scale never seen before in human history.
Socialism was implemented in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Bulgaria,
Hungary, Maoist China, Chavez-Maduro's Venezuela, and other places. [In
every one of these places, it has failed]{.underline}. As American
writer Joshua Muravchik observes in his 2019 Wall Street Journal article
on socialism, "[It's hard to think of another idea that has been tried
and failed as many times in as many ways or at a steeper price in human
suffering]{.underline}." 

Despite its demonstrated record of producing evils, however, [the spirit
of socialism is very much alive today]{.underline} even in the United
States. According to a 2019 Gallup poll, as many as 49% of millennials
and members of Gen Z (ages 18 to 39 in 2019) hold a favorable view of
socialism. Socialists are fond of saying that socialism has not failed
because real socialism has never been tried. In the eyes of
today's democratic socialists, the earlier socialist leaders failed
because they were "authoritarian socialists" who believed in a strictly
hierarchical, top-down bureaucracy and "perverted" socialism's noble
ideals---if, instead, our socialist government is led by public-spirited
people whose beliefs are rooted in democratic principles, then we will
achieve real socialism and all will be well. The problem, they argue,
has never been the socialist horse, but the jockeys who rode it and led
it astray.

This couldn't be further from the truth. [When today's socialists talk
about building a non-authoritarian socialist government rooted in
democratic and humanitarian principles, they are far from
original]{.underline}. In fact, that has always been what the earlier
socialists said they would achieve. Aimed at improving the lot of the
common people and creating a more egalitarian society, the early
socialist movements emerged primarily as a reaction to the inhumane
working conditions and yawning wealth disparities in industrialized
Europe. Empowering working-class people, dismantling societal
hierarchies, and ensuring a more equitable distribution of goods and
services have always been among the many honorable objectives of
socialist leaders. [Socialist regimes have all ended in varying degrees
of totalitarianism, to be sure, but there is no denying that earlier
socialist leaders, just like today's, generally started with good
intentions]{.underline}.  

Lenin's seminal book The State and Revolution, presumably the closest
thing ever to a Leninist manifesto, does not read at all like a master
plan for creating some sort of a totalitarian society. Instead, we see
Lenin's sheer authenticity in trying to salvage his nation and
envisioning a brighter future for the masses. Hugo Chávez, architect of
Venezuela's socialist experiment, was constantly praised for his noble
intentions by mainstream intellectuals such as Cornel West, Naomi Klein,
and Noam Chomsky. President Carter claimed that he "never doubted Hugo
Chavez's commitment to improving the lives of millions of his fellow
countrymen." Not even Stalin and Mao set out with the intention of
creating a totalitarian state and turning their countries into a living
hell. [It was always in practice, however, that socialist regimes turned
out to be totalitarian.]{.underline} As German economist Kristian
Niemietz put it, "[Socialism is always democratic and emancipatory in
its aspirations, but oppressive and authoritarian in its actual
practice]{.underline}."

The problem, therefore, has not been bad jockeys, but the socialist
horse itself. [Real socialism has been tried many, many times and it has
ended in dismal failure without exception]{.underline}. By the time it
collapsed in 1991, the [USSR had left humanity with]{.underline} what
German historian Tarik Cyril Amar called "[a legacy of tyranny and
oppression, at first manically bloodthirsty and then (mostly)
depressingly drab]{.underline}." Its economy had been stagnating for two
decades with farms and factories producing far short of the demand.
Soviet satellite states, independent in name only, were held under tight
rein by the USSR and replicated most of the brutal methods the Soviets
used to suppress opposing voices. Their economies were even more
enfeebled than the Soviet economy, with the New York Times in 1987
calling Eastern Europe "increasingly a museum of the early industrial
age." Singapore, a city-state that had only two million residents at the
time, was exporting 20 percent more machinery to the West than all of
Eastern European nations combined. 

In Asia, Mao's Soviet-style socialism plunged China into two of its most
catastrophic historical periods ever: the Great Leap Forward and the
Cultural Revolution. The former was a bold, comprehensive campaign to
industrialize China's agrarian economy that went horribly wrong and
resulted in more than 30 million Chinese starving to death. The latter
was Mao's attempt to purge political opposition and reassert his
authority after the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Notwithstanding
the benign-sounding name, the Cultural Revolution was notoriously
vicious. [It crippled the Chinese economy, obliterated much of China's
social fabric, and caused yet another two million deaths]{.underline}.
It wasn't until the late seventies when Deng Xiaoping steered China away
from socialist planning and incorporated elements of the free-enterprise
system that the country's well-known economic miracle started gaining
momentum. 

[More recently, Chavez's and Maduro's socialist regimes have turned
Venezuela, once the wealthiest nation in South America, into utter
ruin]{.underline}. Its economy is now marked by hyperinflation,
oppression, and starvation, with nearly one-fifth of the population
having already fled the country since 2014. Socialism has also been
tried in Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Somalia, and
many other countries. The end result has always been the same: tyranny
and mass suffering. Ordinary citizens, the very people whom the
socialists claimed to champion, were shot dead on the streets, thrown in
prison camps, and deprived of the most basic human rights. [What started
as a well-meaning commitment to improve life for the masses brought
about economic collapse, political oppression, and more than 100 million
deaths across socialist societies. ]{.underline}

German philosopher G.W. F. Hegel famously said, "We learn from history
that we do not learn from history." The enduring appeal of socialism
attests to Hegel's insight. However, the underlying problem is not that
we are unable or unwilling to learn from history. Rather, we have so
often found ourselves repeating the mistakes of previous generations
because we have taken the wrong lessons from those mistakes. [The
conclusion we should draw from our socialist experiments is not that we
need a different jockey to achieve real socialism, but that real
socialism has been the problem all along. Unless we truly take this
lesson to heart, it won't be long before we find ourselves stuck in a
living hell once again]{.underline}.

[Why is the globe's greatest military alliance so often in
**crisis**]{.underline}? President Donald Trump's reelection last
November, and Vice President JD Vance's deliberately insulting speech in
Munich in February, cast the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into
grave anxiety. But it's [[hardly]{.mark} the **[first time]{.mark}** the
[alliance]{.mark} has been [at risk]{.mark} of falling
apart.]{.underline}

NATO remade Europe, and the world, in the decades after its founding in
1949, by bringing peace and security to a continent that had repeatedly
touched off global wars. Yet from the beginning, NATO has been a
contentious coalition: [Its members have been at each other's throats
even as they have also locked arms]{.underline}.

Yes, [**Trump** sometimes seems downright hostile to NATO, but
**[previous US leaders]{.mark}** [threatened]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[leave]{.mark} the alliance]{.underline} or simply looked forward to the
day when Europe could take care of itself. NATO's history is an odd
combination of epic, history-changing achievements and existential
crises.

Transatlantic angst is currently surging, as Trump travels to The Hague
for a NATO summit this week. He almost withdrew from NATO in his first
term; his second has raised serious questions about its survival.

But [[NATO's]{.mark} current [crisis]{.mark} [isn't]{.mark}
[solely]{.mark} **[Trump]{.mark}'s doing**]{.underline}. And [if his
[presidency]{.mark} stands a real chance of rupturing the alliance, it
[could]{.mark}, [ironically]{.mark}, still **[renew]{.mark}**
[it]{.mark} instead]{.underline}. For decades, the [flip side of crisis
has been **resilience**]{.underline}. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[need]{.mark} every bit of]{.underline} that [[resilience]{.mark} to
meet its current challenge]{.underline} --- [[and]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark}
a [breakup]{.mark}]{.underline} that could be [[disastrous]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} Europe, America and [[the]{.mark} wider
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

NATO is America's gold-standard alliance, but it wasn't America's idea.
The US had no tradition of peacetime security commitments in Europe
before World War II. It had no intention of making them after that war
ended. But [[Washington]{.mark} ultimately **[stayed]{.mark}**, and led
this enduring alliance, [because]{.mark} there was **[no other
solution]{.mark}** to the strategic problem of anarchy in the Old
World]{.underline}.

Europe had destroyed itself twice in a generation. Both conflicts
sprawled across oceans and ensnared the US. After World War II, old
antagonisms lingered and new radicalisms threatened. The French feared
German resurgence; the Soviet Union dominated Eastern Europe with ample
opportunities to expand to the west.

Only the US had the power to secure Western Europe against external
threats, while also smothering the internal animosities that might again
set things alight. So the Truman administration agreed to join an
alliance proposed by its weaker members --- whose goal, NATO's first
secretary general quipped, was to keep the Americans in, the Germans
down and the Soviets out.

NATO succeeded outlandishly in that mission. It helped the transatlantic
community contain and outcompete the Soviet Union. It provided the
security in which old enemies could become allies and Europe's killing
fields could become a democratic zone of peace. NATO became the core of
America's free-world coalition and a pillar of the expanding liberal
order. The [alliance performed so brilliantly that it endured after the
Cold War ended:]{.underline} NATO [took in new members from across the
old Iron Curtain to expand the geography of Europe's peace]{.underline}.

NATO is truly the most successful standing alliance in history. But it
has been tested, repeatedly and severely, along the way.

75 Years of Bickering

The alliance's founding document, the North Atlantic Treaty, was signed
on April 4, 1949. The internal fights --- over military strategy, trade
and nearly everything else --- started soon thereafter.

[[NATO]{.mark} [seemed]{.mark} [like]{.mark} it [might]{.mark}
**[fracture]{.mark}** during]{.underline} the painful [debate over [West
German rearmament]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [1950s, or the bitter
disputes about [Iraq]{.mark} in 2003]{.underline}. The [[Suez
affair]{.mark} of 1956]{.underline} --- in which Washington refused to
back a Franco-British bid to seize the Suez Canal --- brought the
alliance to the breaking point. The [[financial]{.mark} and monetary
[fights]{.mark}]{.underline} of the 1960s and 1970s, the [arguments over
arms races and [arms control]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980s, all
[**[shook]{.mark}** [NATO]{.mark} to its **core**]{.underline}.

France quit the NATO military command in 1966 and insisted that all US
troops leave its territory. "Does that include the dead Americans in
military cemeteries?" Secretary of State Dean Rusk acidly replied. He
wasn't the only US leader to wonder if the alliance was worth the
headaches involved.

Dwight Eisenhower asked when Western Europe could get its act together
so America could "sit back and relax somewhat." During intra-alliance
brawls in the 1950s and 1960s, US officials threatened, albeit
implicitly, to bring the troops home. Some things never change: In 2011,
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warned that freeloading friends might
eventually be on their own. Trump is ruder and crasser about these
issues. But he's not the first to question whether NATO is a good deal
for the US.

[NATO is **frequently** seized by crisis; Americans have long been
seized with ambivalence about that pact]{.underline}. So why is the
alliance so troubled, and why has it endured?

Outrageous Ambition

[NATO's [fractiousness]{.mark} might as well be **[written into]{.mark}
its [charter]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The organization spans an ocean and
two continents; it stretches from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. Its
[[members]{.underline}]{.mark} --- 12 initially,
[[32]{.underline}]{.mark} today --- [have tremendously [diverse]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark}, [histories, geographies and levels of
power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

NATO [includes a **superpower** and microstates]{.underline},
[prosperous and]{.underline} comparatively [poor societies, countries
with tremendous physical security and states that have repeatedly been
invaded]{.underline}. At its start, it featured both dictatorships and
democracies. Its members included fading colonial empires as well a
leader that styled itself an opponent of colonialism despite building a
mostly informal empire of its own. Add in the [[inevitable]{.mark}
**[personality]{.mark} [clashes]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- between
French President Charles de Gaulle and US President Lyndon Johnson,
between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and other toxic
twosomes --- and it's [[no wonder]{.mark} that **[internal
fights]{.mark}** are [frequent]{.mark} affairs]{.underline}.

Those [quarrels]{.underline} also [flow from **NATO's** outrageous
ambition]{.underline}. From the outset, the [alliance required the
**US** to defend countries thousands of miles from its
borders]{.underline}. That, in turn, required massive overseas troop
deployments backed by threats of nuclear escalation. The US built an
ocean-bridging complex of power and commitment to defend Western Europe.
But the [European [allies]{.mark} were [never]{.mark} fully
[convinced]{.mark} that a **[far-away superpower]{.mark}** would
[risk]{.mark} national [suicide]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [defend]{.mark}
them]{.underline} --- [[and]{.mark} [US leaders]{.mark} were [never
persuaded]{.mark} the [allies]{.mark} were [bearing]{.mark} their share
of the [load]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Despite all this, [NATO persisted because it always had
enemies]{.underline} --- the Soviet Union, Islamic radicals, Vladimir
Putin's Russia --- [noxious enough to keep its members
together]{.underline}. The democratic values shared by most of those
states provided ideological cohesion and a shared commitment to making a
world where liberalism could thrive.

NATO also survived because it fostered deep, institutionalized ties
between militaries, governments and societies. And over time, NATO's
longevity enhanced its resilience: [The [longer it exist]{.mark}ed, the
[less]{.mark} its [members]{.mark} could [imagine]{.mark} doing
[**without it**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

These [attributes gave NATO a remarkable ability for adaptation, even
reinvention]{.underline}. The [alliance made]{.underline} the transition
from the [US nuclear monopoly]{.underline} of the 1940s [to]{.underline}
the era of [**m**utual **a**ssured **d**estruction; from]{.underline}
[American economic dominance to]{.underline} a world in which [European
countries became Washington's commercial competitors.]{.underline} It
navigated periods of higher and lower Cold War tensions. Once the Cold
War ended, it went from policing to bridging to East-West divide.

NATO's real superpower is its ability to thrive amid changing
circumstances, an ability it must summon amid the crisis now underway.

Four Big Threats

That crisis isn't wholly about Trump, despite his inimitable ability to
make nearly everything about himself. [NATO is [currently]{.mark} being
[tested by **four**]{.mark} **convergent [crises]{.mark}** that run
deeper than Trump's disruptive effects.]{.underline}

[[First]{.mark}, a crisis of **[security]{.mark}**, created [by]{.mark}
[Russia's]{.mark} serial [aggression]{.mark} in the East.]{.underline}
Since 2022, NATO has responded by supporting Ukraine's fight for
survival; the alliance expanded to include Finland and Sweden, and its
members ramped up spending on defense. But European defense chiefs fear
that if Moscow wins in Ukraine, it might test NATO militarily, perhaps
in Baltic states that are half-ringed by Russian power. Even if it
doesn't, NATO will face an angry, hyper-militarized adversary, one that
is already waging hybrid warfare --- subversion, sabotage, political
meddling --- from one end of the continent to the other.

[[Second]{.mark}, a crisis of **[preparation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
After the Cold War, NATO grew more geographically ambitious: It
intervened "out of area," in locales from the Balkans to Afghanistan.
But it [became [less]{.mark} [militarily]{.mark} [capable]{.mark},
thanks to a quarter-century peace dividend.]{.underline} By the
mid-2010s, German troops were, ridiculously, exercising with broomsticks
in place of guns.

Weakness was a testament to success: NATO had created a cocoon of
security that allowed European states to disarm. But that weakness
intensified accusations of free riding by Washington and left the
alliance ill-prepared to confront a resurgent Russian threat.

[[Third]{.mark}, a crisis of **[shifting
priorities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Europe was Washington's top priority
in the Cold War because it was the crucial swing region, economically
and militarily, in the Soviet American contest. Since then, however,
[the [world's center of economic gravity]{.mark} has [moved to]{.mark}
the [east]{.mark}. The primary military danger zone is not the Fulda Gap
but the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}

American attention is shifting, fitfully but inevitably, to the Pacific.
"Asia Firsters" are asking whether the US should still underwrite
European stability in an Indo-Pacific age.

[[Finally]{.mark}, there is the crisis of
**[credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Europeans]{.mark} have always
[wondered]{.mark} [whether]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} will [be
there]{.mark} [when it matters]{.mark}.]{.underline} How could those
fears not be turbocharged in the age of Trump?

Trump isn't original in questioning the value of NATO. But Europe never
had to deal with a US president who threatened to violently seize
territory from allies, or so gleefully threatened to abandon those
allies if they are attacked. Economic disputes are normal, but no
American president has so wantonly jeopardized global prosperity --- or
seemed so much happier in the company of aggressive autocrats than
longtime democratic friends.

What's more, Trump did temporarily sever US support for Ukraine, leaving
European countries wondering who might be next. His subordinates
sometimes talk (or text) like they'd prefer the Europeans just drop
dead. So Trump is now magnifying NATO's other crises, and leading
analysts, on both sides of the Atlantic, to wonder if the alliance might
crumble after all.

The US Still Needs Europe

For some NATO skeptics, that outcome wouldn't be so bad: They hope that
a US departure might force Europe to get its act together and become an
equal partner in defense of the democratic world. In reality, a Europe
that no longer enjoys US protection wouldn't be as accommodating of US
interests, on issues from dollar dominance to the security of the
Western Pacific. And [the [reason]{.mark} that US [officials]{.mark}
[never]{.mark} [walked away]{.mark} from the alliance, [is that]{.mark}
doing so could be [disastrous]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [everyone]{.mark}
involved]{.underline}.

In the near term, a [[transatlantic split]{.mark} would]{.underline} rip
the guts out of NATO. It would [[leave]{.mark} European
[countries]{.mark}, even ones now arming themselves with urgency,
[struggling to]{.mark} project power to the edge of the continent and
[counter]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n threat.]{.underline} It would
deprive Europe of the patron whose support produces firmness against
autocratic pressure --- and whose leadership helps reconcile divergent
interests into a coherent transatlantic agenda. The result, most likely,
would be a weaker, more fractured continent that becomes a source of
debility for the democratic world.

Indeed, there's a reason that strategic autonomy --- the idea that
Europe can do without the US --- is taken more seriously in the
sheltered western part of the continent than in Poland, Finland and
other countries in the imperiled north and east. The European defense
industrial base is feeble and splintered. The continent can't quickly
replace NATO's American-led command structures. Nor can the French or
British take over America's nuclear responsibilities: They lack the big,
flexible arsenals, the extensive forward troop deployments, and the
damage-limitation capabilities that have typically been required to make
extended deterrence work.

Asia Firsters in Washington might think European weakness doesn't
matter, so long as the US is strong in the Western Pacific. They ought
to think again. Europe and the UK account for about 20% of world gross
domestic product: It's hard to believe that cutting the continent loose
will somehow make America more competitive, economically and
technologically, against Beijing. And if the US does turn its back on
Europe, it may struggle to remain a successful global power.

Europe still represents America's entry point into Western Eurasia, the
supercontinent where so much of the action happens, and its staging
point for Africa and the Middle East --- where Trump has now become
embroiled in exactly the sort of war he pledged to avoid. With a
European foothold, the US is positioned for influence across several
important regions. Without it, America risks being locked into the
Western Hemisphere --- on one side, at least --- and locked out of the
struggle for wide swaths of the world. Then there's the possibility that
a post-American Europe could return --- not immediately, but eventually
--- to the darker patterns of its past.

[Peace isn't Europe's natural condition: America's presence transformed
a tortured continent. [American]{.mark} [absence]{.mark} could
[rip]{.mark} the [crucial safeguards]{.mark} [away]{.mark}.]{.underline}

After a US departure, political and economic rivalries might take on
menacing undertones.

The illiberalism and hypernationalism of earlier eras, never fully
buried, could force their way to the surface. Border disputes and
revisionist grievances might intensify. As arms races resume and nuclear
proliferation becomes more common, a conflict-prone Europe could again
export instability and violence to the world.

The fact that this scenario seems unthinkable today only reveals how
dramatically Europe changed under US leadership. It could change
dramatically, for the worse, in a post-American age.

#### NATO lacks the capability to contain Kremlin, especially in the context of hybrid warfare tactics

Ever since Russia began the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February
2022, debate has raged over whether Vladimir Putin's ambitions extend
further. Could the Kremlin dictator actually attack NATO? Initially,
many were skeptical, but [[as]{.mark} Russia's [invasion]{.mark} has
**[escalated]{.mark}** into the largest European war since World War II,
[more]{.mark} and more security [experts believe]{.mark} that some kind
of [Russian attack]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} alliance is now
a **[realistic]{.mark} possibility**.]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark} [Secretary-General]{.mark}]{.underline} Mark Rutte
recently [[stated]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} [could mount]{.mark} a
**military [operation]{.mark}** against a NATO member state
[within]{.mark} the [next five years]{.mark}]{.underline}. Numerous
intelligence services and military officials within the alliance concur.
This Russian threat to NATO is helping to spur the largest European
rearmament drive since the end of the Cold War. [However, increased
[defense]{.mark} [spending]{.mark} alone [will **not solve**]{.mark}
Europe's Putin problem.]{.underline} NATO members must also convince the
Kremlin that they have the political will to defend themselves, while
urgently updating their military doctrines to reflect the
drone-dominated realities of modern warfare.

[[Those]{.mark} who [question]{.mark} [Russia's ability]{.mark} to
attack NATO typically point to the underwhelming performance of the
Russian army in Ukraine.]{.underline} They note that the current
invasion has exposed the limitations of Putin's war machine and argue
that Russia would have no chance in any direct confrontation with the
far more formidable forces of the NATO alliance. [This is true enough,
but it [assumes]{.mark} that Russia's [only option]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
to launch a [conventional war]{.mark} against NATO.]{.underline} In
reality, a [[future]{.mark} Russian [attack]{.mark} [would be]{.mark}
far [more likely]{.mark} to employ **[hybrid warfare]{.mark}
tactics**]{.underline} or rely on the Kremlin's rapidly evolving drone
warfare capabilities.

One possible scenario would involve a limited Russian cross-border
incursion into the Baltics under the pretext of protecting the ethnic
Russian population in countries like Estonia or Latvia. The strategic
calculation behind such a move would be to test NATO's resolve, betting
that the alliance might avoid a direct military confrontation and
instead resort to diplomacy. If the alliance chose not to respond
militarily, it would seriously undermine the credibility of NATO's core
commitment to collective defense.

This outcome looks all too plausible when considered in the context of
Russia's recent ability to intimidate NATO countries and limit Western
military support for Ukraine. The West's excessive caution since 2022
has already emboldened Putin, encouraging him to escalate the invasion
of Ukraine and expand his territorial demands. Crucially, this Western
weakness may also have convinced Putin that Russia's enemies lack the
requisite resolve for a direct military confrontation and will always
ultimately back down.

Russia's overwhelming current advantage in drone manufacturing is
another key factor that may persuade Putin to move against NATO sooner
rather than later. Over the past three years, Russia has built up an
extensive domestic drone industry that is now producing thousands of
units each month. This is already evident in Ukraine, with nightly
bombardments involving more than 500 drones becoming a routine feature
of the war. Russian drones are also undergoing constant technological
upgrades to become deadlier and more difficult to intercept.

[In contrast, [NATO nations **lag far behind**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Drone production across the alliance remains fragmented.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the drones that are available are often outdated and poorly
integrated into broader military structures. [Unlike Ukraine and Russia,
no European army has established a dedicated unmanned aerial force
component.]{.underline} Instead, major NATO exercises still tend to
treat drones as tactical novelties rather than the decisive weapons of
the modern battlefield. While the rapid rise of drone warfare is no
secret, it would certainly seem that many NATO commanders have not yet
fully digested the lessons of the Russia-Ukraine War.

The situation in terms of missile production is similar. [While [Western
output]{.mark} is still extremely **[modest]{.mark}**, [Russia]{.mark}
is now able to [produce **hundreds**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [ballistic and
cruise missiles **every**]{.mark} **[month]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Increasingly, Russian rockets feature new modifications that allow them
to evade Western air defense technologies such as the Patriot system.
These dramatic advances in Russia's drone and missile arsenal give the
Kremlin a significant edge over NATO that Moscow may wish to exploit
before the gap closes.

[Putin is also likely to view the current geopolitical climate as being
**exceptionally favorable** for Russia.]{.underline} US President Donald
Trump has raised serious questions over his readiness to defend
America's NATO allies. Other members of the alliance are cranking up
defense spending, but the process still lacks a sense of urgency. While
Baltic and Nordic countries are taking important steps like withdrawing
from earlier treaties banning the use of anti-personnel mines and
digging defensive trench networks close to the Russian border, these
efforts are relatively isolated.

A conventional armed conflict between Russia and NATO remains unlikely,
but the [Kremlin can choose from a range of options that stop short of
full-scale war while serving Russian interests]{.underline}. At present,
Russia's objective is not seizing NATO territory but causing the
collapse of the alliance. This can be achieved by taking advantage of
NATO's reluctance to risk war with Russia, and by capitalizing on the
alliance's slow response to the growing dominance of drone warfare. [The
[Kremlin]{.mark} [can]{.mark} also [easily **escalate**]{.mark} its
existing hybrid war [against]{.mark} the [West]{.mark} [including cyber
attacks, information offensives, sabotage operations, and targeted
assassinations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

By defending itself so effectively against Russia's invasion, Ukraine
has already bought NATO precious time. Looking ahead, the Ukrainian
military can play a key role in bolstering European security thanks to
the country's unrivaled experience of modern drone warfare and other
military innovations. However, [Kyiv cannot instill the necessary
**political will** in European capitals or convince Ukraine's allies to
treat the Russian threat with the seriousness it deserves]{.underline}.
That must come from Western leaders themselves.

Allies Are Paying Their Dues

So is NATO's long run finally over? Or can the alliance be renewed once
more? The answer has epic global implications, and it will hinge heavily
on the leadership of Donald Trump.

It's easy to envision a scenario in which Trump cripples the alliance,
because we may already be living through it. In this scenario, Trump
continues to pervert NATO by threatening the territorial integrity of
its members. Unresolved trade wars create a poisonous transatlantic
climate.

Trump withdraws large contingents of US troops, to punish European
countries or shift focus to Asia. He worsens Europe's crisis of security
by abandoning Ukraine and palling around with Putin. A new, illiberal
alliance emerges as Trump elevates right-wing figures --- like Hungary's
Viktor Orban or the AfD in Germany --- with more sympathy for Russia
than for NATO's core ideals.

In this scenario, Trump wouldn't have to formally withdraw from NATO. He
would make the alliance a dead letter by destroying its strategic
cohesion and trust.

Trump may not be the sole source of NATO's crisis, but he certainly has
the power to make it fatal. Fortunately, there's a more constructive
scenario, which isn't out of the question yet.

[In this scenario, [Trump]{.mark} eventually [shuts up about]{.mark}
**annexing [Greenland and Canada]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [he
[settles]{.mark} [for]{.mark} greater **[cooperation]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} [security]{.mark} and his missile
shield]{.underline}, Golden Dome, instead. A trade truce soothes the
US-EU relationship. An administration consumed by Middle Eastern crises
comes to see the value of the military access and diplomatic support the
European allies provide.

[Most fundamentally, Trump [takes **yes**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} an
[answer on **burden-sharing**]{.mark}]{.underline}: The [alliance is
coalescing, albeit haltingly and with plenty of caveats, around
agreement on a major jump in military spending]{.underline} (3.5% of GDP
on defense, 1.5% on infrastructure and related investments). Those
[[outlays]{.mark} will [help]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} [adjust]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} an era in which its strength must be focused on
**[defending]{.mark}** its most vulnerable
[borders]{.mark}.]{.underline} European states will bear more of that
burden, even as Washington anchors the European defense with its unique
capabilities --- dominant airpower, lift and logistics, command and
control, and a powerful nuclear deterrent --- along with enough of a
frontline presence to demonstrate it will be in any fight from the
start.

The [[result]{.mark} of this scenario would be a
**[stronger]{.mark}**]{.underline}, if somewhat scarred,
[**[Europe]{.mark}** that [bolsters]{.mark} the [free world]{.mark}
[while]{.mark} [retaining]{.mark} the **[vital transatlantic
tie]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The opening months of Trump's second
presidency might be remembered as an ugly moment that contributed to the
latest, needed renegotiation of the transatlantic compact.

Whether Trump can deliver this second scenario is deeply uncertain. [His
[approach]{.mark} to NATO has become **[less combative]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} [recent months]{.mark}. The danger of a total American
sellout of Ukraine has, for the moment, faded.]{.underline}

Yet suspicion of NATO is core to Trump's worldview. A president who
can't resist tormenting perceived opponents may find it hard to shift
from disruption to the reassurance that is required to make a new
transatlantic bargain stick. Our era is rife with crisis. But the most
critical question of the coming years may be whether Trump finally
accepts the argument that persuaded his predecessors --- that NATO, for
all its burdens and frustrations, really is indispensable for the world,
and for America, too.

President Trump's tariffs remain contentious, and in response China is
exploiting U.S. reliance on rare-earth and critical minerals by ordering
restrictions on exports.

[[Alaska]{.mark} [has]{.mark} [untapped deposits of]{.mark} these
**[minerals]{.mark}**, [including]{.mark} [tantalum]{.mark},
[which]{.mark} could serve as an **[alternative]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}

These minerals are needed for the production of engines, computers and

demand.

[These [minerals]{.mark} are [located]{.mark} **[throughout]{.mark} the

Why aren't they being mined from Alaska and made available to American
industry? Because most are on federal land, which constitutes roughly
two-thirds of the state's landmass of more than 356 million acres.

Federal restrictions on access to these lands and permitting
requirements are mandated by numerous federal agencies to the point that
development hasn't been allowed to occur. Out-of-state national
environmental groups have made a big business of opposing any Alaska
resource development, including rare-earth minerals.

It would take a presidential order to expedite rare-earth and critical
mineral development on known sites. Gov. Mike Dunleavy must join our
congressional delegation in appealing to Mr. Trump so that Alaskans can
be heard.

### Greenland Mining Low\-\--2NC

reality behind the hype,"
https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/46b1a1ac-b3f0-51e8-a38e-1253df4c3e26\]

So far, [reality has **failed** to live up to the hype]{.underline}.
Greenland banned new oil and gas exploration in 2021, after costly
exploration efforts turned out empty-handed. Although it has enjoyed
some mining success in the past, [Greenland now hosts just **two active
mines**: Amaroq Minerals' Nalunaq **gold mine** in south Greenland and
Lumina's **White Mountain** (Qaqortorsuaq) **anorthosite** mine in west
**Greenland**]{.underline}.

[Another **gemstone mine** by Norwegian Greenland Ruby shut down because
of **low levels** of **production**]{.underline} and forced the company
to declare bankruptcy in September.

For all the interest generated by Mr Trump's first term, [only one US
firm holds a **mineral exploration** **licence** in
Greenland]{.underline}, compared with 18 from the UK, six from Canada
and five from the Czech Republic. [**Anglo American**, which is
searching for minerals in west Greenland, is the only **major mining
firm** on the island]{.underline}.

"[We have been **digging** and asking for **investment** now for **50
years** and **nothing has happened**]{.underline}," says Minik Rosing, a
Greenlander and geobiology professor at the University of Copenhagen.

Tourists and mines

Greenland is a constituent territory within the Kingdom of Denmark,
after its official status as a Danish colony came to an end in 1953.

The ruling government has promised to pursue independence through a
referendum, but many fear the impact it could have on living standards.
Greenland's economy, which has an annual GDP of just \$3.2bn, is
dominated by fishing and the public sector. Danish subsidies account for
nearly half of the government's budget.

"The government is looking towards both tourism and mining" to build
economic self-sufficiency, says Christian Keldsen, CEO of the Greenland
Business Association.

Greenland's fjords and glaciers offer the natural beauty many tourists
want. 141,000 people visited the island in 2023 --- the highest number
on record. Its first international airport opened in Nuuk, the capital,
in late November. It is the first of three airport projects partially
backed by Denmark that collectively cost more than \$800m. United
Airlines will launch direct flights from New York to Nuuk in June.

The island also boasts 43 of the 50 minerals deemed 'critical', or
essential to the economy and national security, by the US government.
This includes the world's eighth-largest reserves of rare-earth
elements, which are vital to the production of green technologies and
military equipment.

Companies 'have to build everything'

[**Harsh weather** conditions and **limited infrastructure** remain
**significant challenges**, however]{.underline}. Greenland is the
world's largest island, as well as its most sparsely inhabited
territory. It has 54 settlements, but no roads linking them. Roughly 80%
of the island is covered in ice.

"Even though the climate is warming and accessibility in Greenland is
improving, it's \[still in\] the Arctic," Tim Boersma, fellow with the
Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, notes. "It's very
remote. There's no railway or bus systems."

[Mining companies "have to **build** **everything**]{.underline}",
Jørgen T Hammeken-Holm, deputy minister of Greenland's Ministry of
Mineral Resources, explains. "Our economy is so small that we can't even
help building an airport, a harbour or a road."

Amaroq Minerals, a Canadian mining company, acquired the Nalunaq gold
mine in South Greenland in 2015. CEO Eldur Ólafsson says the company has
built a permanent base, including drill rigs, specialised mining
equipment, a processing plant and an environmental, social and
governance department.

"[This kind of infrastructure is **unknown** in **Greenland**, in any
company]{.underline}," he adds. Amaroq completed its first gold pour
there in November and plans to increase production this year.

Skills gap

[Another challenge is that rare-earth mining might involve the
extraction of uranium as a **by-product**]{.underline}. In 2021,
Greenland limited the amount of uranium allowed in mined resources due
to its environmental impact. The new law halted development at the
Kuannersuit mine, which holds one of the largest rare-earth deposits in
the world, but would have fallen foul of the new restrictions. The
mine's owner, Australian mining company Greenland Minerals, remains
locked in legal disputes over its future.

[Access to local labour is also a **major impediment** for many
**companies**]{.underline}. Greenland's workforce numbers just 27,800
--- of which only a minority are classified as skilled.

"The idea of locals working in the mine is promoted as a potential way
of creating benefits for them. But often the [locals are **not
interested** because they already have **jobs** or live from **fishing**
and **hunting**]{.underline}," says Anne Merrild, head of sustainability
and planning at Aalborg University, who grew up in Greenland.

#### Almost all projects are [shuttered]{.underline}.

**Gettleman '25** \[Jeffrey et al; March 3; studied at Oxford,
international correspondent and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize; New York
Times, "For Greenland's Minerals, the Harsh Reality Behind the
Glittering Promise,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/world/europe/greenland-minerals-trump.html\]

[Greenland is **littered** with **shuttered projects** and abandoned
sites]{.underline}. A [ruby mine near the east coast closed in 2022 amid
**soaring debts**]{.underline}. Around the same time, [Greenland's
government **formally abandoned** its **oil** ambitions]{.underline},
[citing the lack of commercial viability and the unacceptable
**environmental risks**]{.underline}.

[Even the search for **diamonds** has **yet to lead** to a
**commercially** **viable** mine]{.underline}.

These days, much of the interest lies in rare earths, but a big rare
earth mine in southern Greenland remains a cautionary tale.

[**Energy** **Transition Minerals**]{.underline}, an Australian mining
enterprise with a sizable investment from a Chinese company, [claims its
site in Greenland has one of the world's **largest deposits** of **rare
earth oxides**]{.underline}. The [company spent more than \$**100
million** developing it, only to have **Greenland's** governing
**party**]{.underline}, Inuit Ataqatigiit, which had campaigned on
[killing the project]{.underline}, do exactly that.

The opposition was strongest in Narsaq, the town closest to the site,
[where residents feared **radioactive contamination**]{.underline}.
**[Uranium]{.underline}** is often found in deposits of rare earth
minerals, and the concern was that the mine could send toxic dust
floating over the community.

#### Logistical and environmental hurdles undermine projects.

**Vaillant '24** \[Tom; November 14; Visual Journalist; Pulitzer Center,
"Greenland's Rare Earths Attract European and U.S. Interest, Signaling
Potential Mining Boom,"
https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/greenlands-rare-earths-attract-european-and-us-interest-signaling-potential-mining-boom\]

Southern Greenland has shown promising reserves of rare earths, with
ongoing exploration underway. [While some **deposits are
sizable**]{.underline}, [the **concentration** of rare earths in the
region\'s ore is **relatively** **low**,]{.underline} according to
Flemming Getreuer Christiansen, a geoscientific consultant with
experience in Greenland\'s mining industry. \"A good rare earth mine has
a content of 3% to 6%, a bad one only 1%,\" he says. [This lower
concentration of the desired elements drives up the **costs** of
extraction and processing]{.underline}.

Could Greenland's rare earth reserves provide significant quantities of
supplies for Europe or the United States in the coming years? Mining has
a long history on the island, dating back to the 19th century, with past
efforts focusing on coal and uranium extraction. Currently, however,
[only **one mine** is **operational**]{.underline},
[extracting]{.underline} **[anorthosite]{.underline}**, [which is used
to produce **rock wool insulation**]{.underline}. Mining for sapphires
and rubies ceased in 2023, [and no **rare earth mine** is yet
**active**]{.underline}.

[Ice floes **block** the **fjords**]{.underline}, especially in winter

One major obstacle is Greenland's harsh climate. [The **northern
coastline** is blanketed in sea ice for **much of the year**, which
makes extraction **prohibitively costly**]{.underline}. \"It\'s far too
expensive there,\" says Christiansen. Southern Greenland, where ice-free
fjords open in summer, has conditions similar to Norway.

[Yet even in the **south**, ice floes **obstruct transport** during
winter]{.underline}, necessitating on-site storage solutions.
Christiansen notes that climate change will ease access over time as the
ice recedes.

\"We know that Greenland has potential to offer key resources such as
rare earths,\" says Florian Vidal, a political scientist from the Arctic
University of Norway. But unlocking this potential will require
investment and skilled personnel, he adds. \"This will be the biggest
challenge for Greenland over the coming decade.\"

In theory, Greenland has sufficient workers to support the mining
activities. However, [multiple airports are **currently** being
**built** across the island, and are drawing from the **same labor
pool**, Christiansen notes]{.underline}. Thus, some employees for the
mines, or at least for their initial construction, would need to come
from abroad, he says.

Environmental concerns are also significant. [Expanding mining
activities could increase **pollution** risks]{.underline}, not only at
the mines but also due to the added shipping traffic in Greenland's
fjords, where fishing is a vital industry. \"There are concerns in the
fjords and among the fishermen,\" says Vidal.

The EU's mining agreement with Greenland\'s government places a strong
emphasis on sustainability. Under the terms of the pact, [resource
extraction will **proceed only** under **stringent environmental
conditions**]{.underline}.

### Greenland Mining Low\-\--China\-\--2NC

#### They've [failed]{.underline}.

**McCarthy '25** \[Simone; May 6; Senior News Desk Reporter, China; CNN,
"Trump says the US needs to protect Greenland from China. Are his fears
overblown?"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/china/china-greenland-footprint-us-suspicion-intl-hnk\]

**[Chinese firms]{.underline}**, like others, [have mounted efforts to
develop **expensive** and **geologically challenging** mining projects
on the **resource-rich island**]{.underline}. They've also bid on
constructing airfields there -- initiatives observers see as linked to
Beijing's broader aims to enhance its role in the Arctic and gain
control of critical minerals.

[But those projects have all **fizzled**]{.underline}, experts say,
[either due to **business** reasons or as governments in both
Greenland's capital Nuuk and US NATO partner Copenhagen **rebuffed
them**]{.underline}, at times reportedly under pressure from Washington.

[That's left]{.underline} "[almost **no** **Chinese footprint** in
Greenland]{.underline}," outside a limited presence in the fishing
industry, according to Andreas Østhagen, a senior researcher at the
Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Norway, who added: "There is no evidence of
any 'aggressive incursions' by any actor in Greenland, at least not
publicly available."

And while experts say that there is Russian military activity across
regional northern seas and China has scaled up naval activities off
Alaska in recent years, in addition to its research and commercial
operations in the broader Arctic, there's been no publicly known signs
of Chinese military vessels operating in the waters around Greenland.

Unless the administration provides more details, "[I assume that Trump
and his advisors are **conflating** various trends taking place in 'the
Arctic,']{.underline} but which in fact take place in specific (other)
parts" in and around the Arctic, said Østhagen.

\<\<Text Condensed, None Omitted\>\>

'Why wouldn't they be interested in Greenland?' When a reporter asked JD
Vance earlier this year if he had been briefed on specific threats from
China and Russia on Greenland and if these were military in nature,
Vance said he didn't "want to get too specific." "But we know the
Chinese are very, very interested in this island. We have seen some of
the economic pressures they have tried to place on Greenland. We know
that they are increasingly engaging in military training and military
interests certainly. They have started to describe themselves as a 'near
Arctic power' -- part of that is justifying taking a firm interest in
Greenland and some of the surrounding territories," he said, in
reference to the "near Arctic state" term that China has used for more
than a decade. "We have seen very strong evidence that both the Chinese
and the Russians are interested in Greenland. Why wouldn't they be
interested in Greenland?" he added. When asked to comment on Trump
administration statements, Beijing has said "relations between countries
should be handled in accordance with the purposes and principles of the
UN." It's also defended its adherence to "basic principles of respect,
cooperation, win-win result and sustainability in engaging in Arctic
affairs." Close observers agree that China has looked to ramp up ties
and investment in the island since the early 2000s -- and has many
reasons to be interested. Greenland is rich in minerals important to the
fabrication of military and high-tech goods, and, as Arctic ice melts,
sea lanes alongside it are expected to become more important for global
shipping. The island and its adjacent waterways are also strategically
important to the US -- and its rivals. Washington's military base plays
a critical role detecting missile threats and conducting space
surveillance. Russia, a dominant military force in the Arctic with an
expansive Arctic Ocean coastline, is seen by observers and US
intelligence as interested in nearby naval routes, which form a key
strategic chokepoint stretching from Greenland toward the United
Kingdom. When it comes to China, "I've yet to see any coast guard
vessels, any naval vessels, let alone aircraft carriers" in waters near
Greenland, said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School
of International Studies in Singapore, noting that Chinese aircraft
carriers are "confined to the Pacific Ocean." Chinese researchers have
written about the island's potential importance for its own critical
mineral supply chains -- as well as its strategic significance as an
entry point for China to influence Arctic affairs and actualize its
"polar silk road" -- a vision to extend leader Xi Jinping's Belt and
Road global infrastructure building drive across the top of the world.
Last year, Beijing dispatched its special representative on European
Affairs to Greenland for talks on economic cooperation, while Nuuk in
2021 opened a representation office in Beijing -- one of only five
globally -- and sent delegations to the Chinese capital in the past.

[But efforts from **Chinese firms** to gain a physical foothold in
Greenland or access its raw materials have been
**ill-fated**]{.underline}.

[Chinese companies did become involved in four major mining **projects**
in Greenlan]{.underline}d, all initiated between 2009 and 2015, [but
those have either **dissolved** or stalled]{.underline}, according to
experts and research from the Danish Institute for International
Studies.

[The most **well-known** of those projects]{.underline}, at [a mine in
coastal **Kvanefjeld**]{.underline}, would have allowed a Chinese-funded
Australian venture to operate what the company described as a project
with the potential to become "the most significant western world
producer of critical rare earths."

The project, however, [was blocked in 2021 when the government
restricted mining deposits with certain uranium
concentrations]{.underline}, [citing **environmental
concerns**]{.underline}. The company has launched an arbitration case
and expressed hope that a new government elected earlier this year could
look more favorably on the project.

[But currently]{.underline}, "[China has **no footprint** at all in
Greenland mining]{.underline}," according to Marc Lanteigne, a professor
at the University of Tromsø: The Arctic University of Norway, who
described [China's footprint on Greenland is]{.underline} "[almost
**negligible**]{.underline}" [besides]{.underline} "[very limited
cooperation in **seafood trade**]{.underline}."

Lanteigne also noted how the Danish government, under pressure from the
United States, stepped in to finance airport refurbishment projects
after a Chinese firm was shortlisted as a potential contractor, with the
firm withdrawing its bid.

The Danish government in 2016 also blocked a Hong Kong firm's bid to
purchase an abandoned naval facility. Plans in 2017 from the Chinese
Academic of Sciences to build a research station also didn't get
government approval, according to researchers.

[China has already **quit Greenland**, at least **for now**]{.underline}

During Trump's first term as President (2017--2021), the United States
stepped up engagement with Greenland due to concerns about Chinese
interests and efforts to establish a presence on the island. [Chinese
attempts to invest in Greenland had already **sparked
controversy**]{.underline}. In 2016, for instance, a Hong Kong-based
company had shown an interest in acquiring a decommissioned Danish naval
base, while in 2018 a Chinese state-owned company bid to extend and
modernize the runways at Greenlandic airports. Both initiatives were
ultimately blocked by Copenhagen.

[Chinese companies]{.underline} have also been involved in mineral
exploration projects in Greenland at various times. However, [either
these companies **lost interest**]{.underline}, [or the Greenlandic
government **halted** the **projects**]{.underline}. The most notable
example is the **[Kvanefjeld]{.underline}** rare earth exploration
project, in which the Chinese company Shenghe Resources acquired a
stake. [This project has been put on hold due to **environmental
concerns** and there is little prospect of]{.underline}
**[resuming]{.underline}** [in the **coming years**]{.underline}.

While some parts of the Chinese bureaucracy have shown an interest in
Greenland for its mineral resources and geostrategic location, [viewing
these investments purely as attempts to **claim** Greenland's
**minerals** or secure a strategic foothold in the Arctic
**oversimplifies** the situation]{.underline}. [These efforts were
probably also driven by Greenland's **active courting** of **Chinese
investment**]{.underline}. Greenland, for example, regularly attended
the annual China Mining Conference in Tianjin and sent business
delegations to China.

Despite declaring itself to be "open for business", however, [Greenland
has struggled to attract **foreign investment**.]{.underline} In this
context, [courting China has proved a **successful strategy for
Nuuk**]{.underline}, as it has put pressure on Europe and the United
States to offer their own investments to counter Chinese proposals.
Since 2019, the US has reopened its consulate in Nuuk, collaborated with
Greenland on mineral exploration and provided packages of economic aid
to the island.

#### China isn't interested in mining in Greenland, despite efforts to attract them.

• [Efforts to attract Chinese investment]{.underline} in mining projects
in Greenland [have]{.underline} so far [yielded **little** interest and
**no significant investment.**]{.underline}

Though Chinese companies have featured prominently in public debates in
both Greenland, Denmark and beyond, in fact [we found **little
evidence** to support the idea that **Chinese firms are eager to invest
in Greenland**,]{.underline} [despite]{.underline} substantial [efforts
by]{.underline} the [Greenland]{.underline} administration [to attract
them]{.underline}. Chinese investment in iron ore, for example, has
slowed in recent years after a series of ill-advised investments in
Western Australia have proved unprofitable and have become a burden on
the domestic iron and steel industry. In addition, while there has been
widespread concern in Greenland about the potential influx of several
thousands of Chinese workers to construct an iron ore mine, we note that
for a population the size of Greenland, which has only 56,000 people,
the sudden arrival of several thousand workers should always be a cause
of concern, regardless where these workers come from. Nevertheless, this
is a reality Greenland will have to face if it is to develop large scale
mines.

#### Greenland doesn't want massive mining operations, Greenlandic minister of resources proves.

"We do have projects underway that I think are very promising: graphite,
gold, copper, nickel, molybdenum and so on. Rare earths as well,"
Nathanielsen told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.

"But for Greenland, [**we are not** necessarily **interested** in
becoming a really great mining country. We just really want 5 or 10
active mines at any given time," Nathanielsen said.]{.underline}

["We are a very small population so, for us, we don't need the entire
country to **be covered in mines**]{.underline}. We are happy with
managing a few and I think that is feasible," she added.

Is Greenland influenced by China?

Failed Foothold: China has shown interest in Greenland's mineral wealth
and proximity to potential shipping routes, but [in recent years its
presence on the island has **dwindled**. In 2018, China released a white
paper detailing its Arctic strategy, including its intention to build a
"Polar Silk Road]{.underline}," in parallel with its Belt and Road
Initiative infrastructure investments in other regions. During the
2010s, Greenland courted Chinese mining companies to invest, but
subsequent [mining projects involving Chinese partners have stalled or
failed]{.underline}. Pressure from the United States also helped quash
Chinese bids to construct new airports and convert an abandoned Danish
naval base into a research station. [Though Greenland has expressed
openness to working with international partners, **China has not renewed
its overtures**.]{.underline} China's main presence in the Arctic is in
Russia. [Greenland's largest trading partner is China, but this fact is
**not** necessarily **significant by itself,** since China is the
largest trading partner for most countries in the world.]{.underline}

#### China is interested in Greenland, but Greenland has rejected it

Now that United States President Donald Trump is making good on some
campaign pledges, like sweeping tariffs levied against Canada, Mexico
and China, the question is whether he will follow through on other
ideas. How far might he take his desire to buy Greenland?

Mr. [Trump cites China as a justification for acquiring this autonomous
territory of Denm]{.underline}ark. And his insistence --- to the point
that a recent phone call with the Danish prime minister was described as
"horrendous" --- has raised eyebrows in Beijing, where officials and
scholars are trying to decipher what Mr. Trump wants and what it means
for China.

"We need it for international security," he said on his first day in
office. "You have Russian boats all over the place, you have China's
boats all over the place --- warships."

[Beijing's ambitions in the Arctic are real. China brands itself a
"near-Arctic state".]{.underline}

The country has been pursuing regional partnerships through a "Polar
Silk Road" plan to create faster shipping routes and research projects
that could have dual-use applications (for both civilian and military
purposes). Greenland's vast reserves of rare earth minerals - critical
for high-tech industries from electric vehicles to missile systems -
could make it an attractive target for Chinese investment.

China\'s Symbolic Footprint

But [China's actual footprint in Greenland is **more symbolic than
substantial**]{.underline}, for now. [Once-promising investments have
fizzled due to **financial problems and political
pushback.**]{.underline}

In recent years, [the **Danish government has revoked the mining license
of a Chinese firm** for non-operation and successfully **opposed a
Chinese state-owned enterprise's bid to build airports in
Greenland**]{.underline}. Just last month, [the Swedish National China
Centre declared that \"China has already quit Greenland\".]{.underline}

Greenland is now firmly in the Western camp when it comes to U.S.-China
strategic competition.

The U.S. is Greenland's largest source of foreign direct investment, the
European Union is its primary trade partner, and it runs a significant
trade surplus with China. Washington has a distinct military edge over
China through its Pituffik Space Base on the island's northwest coast,
under a defense agreement with Denmark.

[Beijing's ambitions to open Arctic trading routes now focus on the
Russian side of the Arctic Sea, suggesting China's Arctic shipping
traffic may not concentrate around Greenland.]{.underline}

#### China is not present in Greenland

### Link\-\--LNG

#### Increasing US LNG exports causes significant human and environmental damages -- it's historically been overlooked.

When we think of methane gas, we think of flaring and drilling
operations that release it directly into

the atmosphere. But there is an untold facet of the methane gas story
that rarely gets much attention. The latest report from Greenpeace is
entitled [Permit To Kill --- Potential Health and Economic Impacts from
**US LNG Export** Terminal Permitted Emissions]{.underline}. That report
was written in cooperation with Oil Change International, which says we
have known for over a decade just how damaging fracking is to our health
but the [health impacts of exporting fracked gas have often been
**overlooked**]{.underline}. The US methane gas industry has been trying
to greenwash its activities by arguing methane is the cleanest fuel
available. There is some truth to that claim, as it does produce less
carbon dioxide when burned than coal or oil, but the [amount of
**methane** that escapes into the atmosphere from well heads and
pipelines more than **offsets** any such advantage]{.underline}.

Methane gas is often condensed into a liquid by pressurizing it to form
liquefied natural gas or LNG. The new report from Greenpeace USA and the
Sierra Club shines a light on just how damaging LNG plants are to the
environment and to human health. It claims the air pollution from
existing LNG export terminals is estimated to cause 60 premature deaths
a year and add about \$1 billion in negative health impacts. At the
current rate, by 2050, existing LNG terminals will have caused over 2000
premature deaths and caused \$28.7 billion in total health costs.

[LNG Plants Are A **Danger** To Human Health]{.underline}

It is about more than methane escaping from those facilities. [LNG
plants emit a toxic mix of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and volatile
organic compounds.]{.underline} According to the Environmental Health
Project, studies have shown that those pollutants are associated with a
range of health concerns including headaches, coughing, dizziness, and
other respiratory illnesses. Exposure to fracked gasses and pollution
can also irritate skin, eyes, nose, and lungs. [**Long-term exposure**
to these pollutants can lead to **heart disease**, certain types of
**cancer**, and damage to the reproductive system and internal
organs]{.underline}.

[Often, those worst affected are **poor communities** of
**color**]{.underline}, who have faced decades of pollution from the
fossil fuel industry, including at LNG terminals. For example, parishes
and counties in and around Southwest Louisiana, where a cluster of LNG
terminals are located, have the worst air pollution impacts per capita.
[At the national level, Black and Hispanic Americans respectively
experience air pollution from LNG terminals at 151--170% and 110--129%
the rate of white Americans.]{.underline} These deaths occur under
existing rules and regulations because LNG export terminals are
permitted to emit levels of air pollution that cause serious health harm
for local communities. LNG terminals are allowed to pollute with the
complicity of the regulators who are meant to protect public health.

In 2022, a review of regulatory documents by Reuters found that the huge
LNG plant at Corpus Christi, Texas, belonging to Cheniere had "exceeded
its permitted limits for emissions of pollutants such as soot, carbon
monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) hundreds of times since
it started up in 2018." Instead of levying fines, the [local
regulator]{.underline}, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality,
[granted Cheniere large **increases** in the amount of pollution that
plant was allowed to **dump** into the environment.]{.underline} Last
year, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade reported those LNG facilities also
under-reported and miscalculated pollution events.

[Building More LNG Export Terminals Is **Environmental
Insanity**]{.underline}

All this pollution could get worse if further LNG plants are built. Back
in January, the Biden administration announced it would be pausing
pending decisions on several LNG export application that would add many
new terminals along the Gulf Coast areas of Texas and Louisiana. That
decision has been condemned by the LNG industry but applauded by
environmental advocates, but it is only a pause on further export
applications, not a denial of applications that have already been
approved.

According to Greenpeace USA and the Sierra Club, there are currently 7
operating LNG export terminals in the United States, with another 6
projects currently under construction and a further 8 planned that have
already received regulatory approval but not yet started construction.
All these were not impacted by the Biden "pause." They estimate that if
all the planned LNG terminals and expansion projects are built, the [LNG
industry would be responsible for **149** premature deaths and **\$2.33
billion** in health costs **per year.**]{.underline} If all the proposed
plants are built, those numbers would increase to 4,470 deaths and a
staggering \$62.2 billion in health costs by 2050.

For the planet and local population, the [US needs to tackle the air
pollution from existing LNG plants and **stop** further
expansion]{.underline}, Oil Change International says. To stop the
public health emergency from getting worse, OCI and the Sierra Club are
recommending that the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, as well as other agencies, "[should **reject**
any approvals or permits for LNG export projects, as well as related
pipelines and compressor stations]{.underline}."

In addition, they say, "DOE and FERC should evaluate the cumulative
impacts of air pollution from existing and the slate of planned LNG
terminals when evaluating the impacts of any specific project on the
surrounding communities." The Environmental Protection Agency must also
develop and enforce more robust controls on the cumulative impacts of
air pollution for the most overburdened communities. Finally, they
advocate for a phasing out of fossil fuel exports, with a commensurate
increase in funding for global climate mitigation and adaptation to help
importing nations transition to renewables and resist becoming dependent
on LNG imports.

The Takeaway

Early this year, 170 scientists wrote to President Biden to urge him to
reject plans to add new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. According
to Food and Water Watch, the letter cited the enormous impact the
proposal would have on global climate pollution --- about 20 times that
of the recently-approved Willow oil drilling project in Alaska. Original
signers of the letter include noted climate and environmental scientists
Rose Abramoff, Robert Howarth, Mark Jacobson, Peter Kalmus, Michael
Mann, Sandra Steingraber, Farhana Sultana, and Aradhna Tripati. The
letter said in part:

"Taken together[, if all U.S. projects in the permitting pipeline are
approved, they could lead to **3.9 billion** tons of greenhouse gas
emissions annually]{.underline}, which is [larger than]{.underline} the
entire annual emissions of the [**E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}....
We implore you to turn back from this course, reject \[these\] fossil
fuel export projects, and put us on a rapid and just trajectory off
fossil fuels."

Bill McKibben added this thought: "People living nearby these enormous
facilities have always known they were enormous, but in recent months
the rest of us have gotten a much better idea of the scale. So much
fracked gas is now pouring out through the Gulf that it wipes out the
gains under the president's IRA clean energy plans. Indeed, it wipes out
all the emission reductions made since the turn of the century (emphasis
added). It's hard to imagine even fossil fuel apologists would approve
such wholesale destruction of the environment if they know the truth.
Now they have no excuse."

#### LNG produces far worse emissions than other forms of fossil fuel through its stringent transportation process

**Milman 24** \[Oliver Milman; environment reporter for Guardian US.

[**Exported gas** emits far more greenhouse gas **emissions** than
coal]{.underline}, despite fossil-fuel industry claims it is a cleaner
alternative, [according to a major new research paper]{.underline} that
challenges the controversial yet rapid expansion of gas exports from the
US to Europe and Asia.

Coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels when combusted for energy, with oil
and gas producers for years promoting cleaner-burning gas as a "bridge"
fuel and even a "climate solution" amid a glut of new liquefied natural
gas (or LNG) terminals, primarily in the US.

But the [research]{.underline}, which itself has become enmeshed in a
political argument in the US, has [concluded that LNG is **33%** worse
in terms of **planet-heating emissions**]{.underline} over a 20-year
period compared with coal.

"The idea that coal is worse for the climate is mistaken -- LNG has a
larger greenhouse gas footprint than any other fuel," said Robert
Howarth, an environmental scientist at Cornell University and author of
the new paper.

"The idea that coal is worse for the climate is mistaken -- LNG has a
larger greenhouse gas footprint than any other fuel," said Robert
Howarth, an environmental scientist at Cornell University and author of
the new paper.

Howarth's research found that [during LNG production, around **half** of
the total emissions occur during the long journey taken by gas as it is
pushed through pipelines to **coastal terminals** after it is initially
drilled]{.underline}, usually via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
from areas such as the US's vast shale deposits.

The [**energy** used to do this]{.underline}, along with the leaks,
[causes pollution]{.underline} that is [exacerbated once the gas gets to
the export facilities]{.underline}. There, it is supercooled to -162C
(-260F) to become a liquid, which is loaded into huge storage containers
on tankers. The [tankers then travel **long distances** to deliver the
product to client countries, where it is turned back into a gas and then
**burned**]{.underline}.

"This [whole process]{.underline} is much [**more energy intensive**
than coal]{.underline}," said Howarth. "The science is pretty clear
here: it's [wishful thinking that]{.underline} the [gas **miraculously**
moves overseas **without any emissions**]{.underline}.."

Howarth's paper has caused something of a firestorm before its
publication, with a draft of the study highlighted by climate
campaigners such as Bill McKibben to the extent it was reportedly a
factor in a decision earlier this year by the Biden administration to
pause all new export permits for LNG projects.

This pause has enraged the oil and gas industry -- prompting lawsuits --
and its political allies. Last month, [four congressional
Republicans]{.underline} wrote to the US energy department [demanding
**correspondence**]{.underline} between it and Howarth [over what they
called]{.underline} his "[**flawed**" and "**erroneous**"
study]{.underline}.

Gas-friendly groups have also argued that the paper overstates emissions
from LNG, an stance echoed by some energy experts. "It's hard to
swallow," said David Dismukes, a leading Louisiana energy consultant and
researcher. "Does gas have a climate impact? Absolutely. But is it worse
than coal? Come on."

Howarth said the [result]{.underline} of this unusual scrutiny was
"[more peer review than I've ever had before]{.underline}", [with five
rounds of review being conducted by eight other scientists]{.underline}.
Howarth said: "[I don't consider the criticism **valid** at all -- it
feels like a **political job**."]{.underline}

Howarth said the US has a "huge choice" to make in the presidential
election, with Donald Trump vowing to undo Biden's pause on his first
day back in the White House to allow a raft of new LNG projects. Kamala
Harris, meanwhile, has backed away from a previous plan to ban fracking
but has promised action on the climate crisis.

More than 125 climate, environmental and health scientists wrote to the
Biden administration last month to defend Howarth's research and urge a
continuation of the pause on LNG exports.

The Howarth paper's findings are "plausible", said Drew Shindell, a
climate scientist at Duke University, who was not involved in the
research.

"Bob's study adds to a lot of literature now that shows the industry's
argument for gas is undermined by the option to go to renewables,"
Shindell said. "The debate isn't really about whether gas is slightly
better or worse than coal, though. [It should be about how both are
**terrible** and that we need to get rid of both of them."]{.underline}

### AT: Breakthrough Institute

#### Reject the Breakthrough Institute\-\--they actively spread misinformation and downplay the climate crisis while pretending to be progressive.

[The Breakthrough Institute]{.underline} is a group that "[has dedicated
the resources of their organization to **trying to kill prospects for
climate and clean energy action**]{.underline} in this Congress [and to
spreading **disinfo**rmation about Obama, Gore, congressional leaders,
Waxman and Markey, leading climate scientists, Al Gore]{.underline}
again, [the entire environmental community and anyone else trying to end
our status quo energy policies]{.underline}," according to Climate
Progress' Joe Romm (6/17/09).

Or, as the New York Times described it when it gave the group's leaders
the prime spot on the op-ed page (4/9/14), it's "an environmental
research organization."

The column by [Breakthrough's]{.underline} Michael [Shellenberger
and]{.underline} Ted [Nordhaus is a good example of]{.underline} what's
known on the Internet as "**[concern
trolling]{.underline}**"---**[shedding crocodile tears over the prospect
that climate advocates]{.underline}** they have done their level best to
undermine **[might not be getting their message out
effectively]{.underline}**. And what's the problem with their messaging?
Well, they're too downbeat:

> There is every reason to believe that efforts to raise public concern
> about climate change by linking it to natural disasters will backfire.
> More than a decade's worth of research suggests that fear-based
> appeals about climate change inspire denial, fatalism and
> polarization.

As one example of this research, the op-ed offers this: "In a controlled
laboratory experiment published in Psychological Science in 2010,
researchers were able to use 'dire messages' about global warming to
increase skepticism about the problem." But as Romm (11/22/10) has
pointed out, both messages tested in that study contained frightening,
factually accurate information about climate change's contributions to
heat waves, hurricanes, wildfires and sea-level rise. (Sample: "The past
decade has seen record breaking heat waves all across the world,
including a major heat wave that killed at least 35,000 people in Europe
in 2003.")

These are the kind of things that Shellenberger and Nordhaus suggest
climate advocates should keep to themselves. Yet what that study
actually found to be ineffective was following up such facts with
messages like "We fear it may be too late" and "It is just too big of a
problem for science to grapple with," whereas the same alarming
information about the impacts of climate change did not increase denial
when coupled with messages like "it is not too late to act" and "human
ingenuity can overcome this mammoth obstacle." Turns out fatalistic
pessimism is a tough sell; who knew?

[Shellenberger and Nordhaus agree that climate advocates should stress
solutions]{.underline}---**[so long as they are their preferred
solutions]{.underline}**:

> The rejection of technologies like nuclear and natural gas by
> environmental groups is most likely feeding the perception among many
> that climate change is being exaggerated. After all, if climate change
> is a planetary emergency, why take nuclear and natural gas off the
> table?

Why? Well, aside from the very real safety issues and the inevitability
of nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear technology is just not an
economically efficient way to replace carbon-based energy. As physicist
Amory Lovins (Inside Nova, 3/18/11) has pointed out:

> Each dollar spent on a new reactor buys about 2--10 times less carbon
> savings, 20--40 times slower, than spending that dollar on the
> cheaper, faster, safer solutions that make nuclear power unnecessary
> and uneconomic: efficient use of electricity, making heat and power
> together in factories or buildings ("cogeneration"), and renewable
> energy.

As for natural gas, it's not clear that it reduces greenhouse emissions
at all, given that methane, which is released by gas drilling and
especially during fracking, is a more powerful heat-trapping gas than
carbon dioxide. But [in a]{.underline} "[planetary
emergency]{.underline}"---which climate change certainly is---[burning
slightly less carbon is not a solution, any more than switching from
whiskey to beer is a cure for alcoholism]{.underline}.

https://perspectives.agf.com/why-does-trump-hate-canada/\]

DONALD TRUMP often picks fights that make no sense, rejecting
traditional U.S. allies for no compelling reason. [That certainly
applies to Canada, the target of **scathing** **Trump** **criticism**
this week]{.underline}.

[RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES hit **rock-bottom** this
week]{.underline}. This is no joke, and perhaps Trump has been
emboldened by speculation that the U.S. could cut a deal with Greenland,
which also is no joke.

[TRUMP WANTS CANADA as the **51st state**]{.underline}, [and he's
unlikely to **ease tariffs**]{.underline} on April 2 unless Canada
capitulates on trade issues. [He **covets** Canada's **natural
resources** and **shipping lanes,** and he's **smarting** because of
what he sees as **disrespect** from **Ottawa**]{.underline}.

IRONICALLY, fentanyl has disappeared as an issue. Just two weeks ago,
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the dispute was all about the
drug, but obviously that was disingenuous. Fentanyl has virtually
nothing to do with this latest crisis.

TRUMP'S ANIMOSITY toward Canada began in his first term as president
when he thought Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was disrespectful to him.
That was a cardinal sin; Trump hits back hard if he doesn't feel the
love from critics.

THE U.S. [PRESIDENT said this week that Trudeau was]{.underline}
"**[nasty]{.underline}**" to him, [and Trump added for good measure that
Canada is one of the]{.underline} "**[nastiest]{.underline}**"
[countries he has to **deal with**]{.underline}. Canada --- nasty ?? Who
knew ??

HE CONTINUED: "[Canada was meant to be the **51st state** because we
subsidize Canada by \$**200 billion a year**]{.underline}," Data from
2024 show a Canadian surplus of \$80 billion.

TRUMP SAYS "[We don't need their **lumber**, we don't need their
**energy**, we don't need **anything**. We **certainly don't want their
automobiles**]{.underline}," When asked why he seems to be tougher on
Canada, Trump said "only because it's meant to be our 51st state."

### Say No\-\--1AR

#### The relationship's [strained]{.underline}.

**Beckett '25** \[Andy; March 24; studied Modern History at Balliol
College, Oxford, and journalism at the University of California,
Berkeley; The Guardian, "In Canada, I saw how Trump is ripping North
America apart -- and how hard its bond will be to repair,"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/24/canada-donald-trump-north-america-relationship\]

[As wealthy but lightly defended countries have **often
learned**]{.underline}, [being close to a much more **powerful
state**]{.underline} -- geographically or diplomatically -- [can be a
**precarious existence**]{.underline}. All it takes is an aggressive new
government in the stronger state and a relatively equal relationship of
economic and military cooperation can suddenly turn exploitative, even
threatening.

Since Donald Trump's second inauguration, [this realisation has been
**dawning** across the **west**]{.underline}, but [nowhere more
**disconcertingly** than in **Canada**]{.underline}. Its border with the
US is the longest in the world: 5,525 miles of often empty and hard to
defend land, lakes and rivers. Canada's two biggest cities, Toronto and
Montreal, are only a few hours to the north, were you to approach them
in a US army tank.

Earlier this month, I spent a week in some of this particularly
vulnerable stretch of Ontario and Quebec, visiting my daughter at
university and encountering a new, more anxious Canada. At times, as the
trains I took crawled along the congested trans-Canadian rail corridor,
the roofs of individual American buildings were visible, glinting in the
cold sun across the border. The feeling of being a foreigner in a tense,
contested place reminded me of when I lived in West Germany, near the
East German border, during the early 1980s, one of the most fraught
phases of the cold war.

[Until Trump started talking so insistently about making
**Canada**]{.underline} [his country's]{.underline} "**[51st
state]{.underline}**", [that would have been an **absurd
comparison**]{.underline}. But not any more. "[The Americans want our
**resources**, our **water**, our **land**, our
**country**]{.underline}," [said]{.underline} the new Canadian prime
minister, [Mark **Carney**]{.underline}, in his first speech as Liberal
leader. "If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life." Supposedly
one of the most harmonious -- and strategically important --
relationships between rich western countries appears to have changed
radically.

The Canadians I spoke to, in shops, at bus stops and stations, at home
and by email, were generally less dramatic about the situation than
Carney, who has a reputation as a leader to establish, and now an
election to win next month. There was some anger at the US -- and at
Britain's failure to condemn Trump's threats against a Commonwealth
country. "The king is proud to align himself with a despot for ... a
dangled trade agreement," a Montreal academic told me, referring to King
Charles's recent invitation to Trump to make a second state visit to
Britain. "A bold response from us in Canada would be to cut our ties
with the monarchy."

More often, however, people shook their heads or rolled their eyes at
Trump's behaviour. He was crazy, chaotic, totally inconsistent, people
told me -- not like a steady and realistic Canadian, they implied. There
were satisfied smiles at the tariff-driven slide in the US stock market.
And yet, people also said, Trump's threats meant that Canadian life
would have to change profoundly. Though what those changes might be was
a topic they generally avoided -- except for a baker in Montreal, who
sold me some sourdough while we discussed whether Canada would need to
get nuclear weapons.

Relations between America and Canada have not always been peaceful. The
US invaded Canada in 1775 and 1812, without success. During the 1920s
and 1930s it drew up a more hypothetical invasion scheme, War Plan Red.
In fundamental ways, fear of the US shaped Canada, encouraging its
unification out of what had originally been disparate territories, and
also the decision to site its capital in Ottawa, further from the border
than its other eastern cities.

As in Britain, in the mid-20th century the Canadian state sought to
create what it called a "special relationship" with the US. Canada's
export-oriented economy -- necessary because of the country's relatively
small and scattered population -- got access to US markets. US
businesses got access to prosperous Canadian consumers, often close to
America's manufacturing heartlands. During the cold war, both countries
saw Canada as a key place to build defences against Russian attack.

[With Trump seemingly much closer to **Moscow** than
**Ottawa**]{.underline}, [that North American alliance may in **effect**
be **dead**]{.underline}. By area, [Canada is the world's second-biggest
country after **Russia**]{.underline}, [but its armed forces are
**tiny**]{.underline}, about half the size of Britain's. [The feeling
that Canada has been **abandoned militarily** by the US possibly
explains the huge]{.underline} "**[Fuck Trump]{.underline}**" [flag I
saw flying from the back of **a pickup truck**]{.underline} in the
usually polite city of Kingston, Ontario, home of the Royal Military
College of Canada.

Economic ties will take longer to unravel. There were still California
carrots on Montreal supermarket shelves, and my trains were passed by
endless goods wagons from the famous old American freight company Union
Pacific. Yet [the number of Canadians visiting the US is already
**plummeting**]{.underline}: last month it was as low as during the
latter stages of the pandemic. In this, as in much else, Canada may be
an early adopter of new habits regarding the US which then spread across
what is left of the liberal west. For left-leaning foreigners, Americana
and American places may lose much of their appeal, because the US has
been made so authoritarian and hostile to outsiders by such a
quintessentially American figure.

[Canada is self-consciously following **another path**]{.underline}.
"[Canada is a **mosaic**]{.underline}," [says Carney]{.underline}, [and
pro-diversity messages **pour out**]{.underline} of its government and
businesses, a[s if calculated to wind up **US
conservatives**]{.underline}. As well as vast, increasingly coveted
supplies of water and minerals, [Canada]{.underline} -- despite its
considerable inequalities and very heavy per capita carbon footprint --
[offers an increasingly **different model** of how to live on the
**North American continent**]{.underline}.

Will Trump or any hard-right successors in the White House allow this
provocation to continue? Another US invasion may not actually be
imminent. Trump already has too many ambitious policy goals. Conquering,
let alone occupying, as enormous and physically extreme a country as
Canada would be an intimidating prospect even for the fantasy-driven
Republicans.

Yet [it's equally hard to imagine **US-Canadian relations** returning
quickly to their **former state**]{.underline}. Too [many **imbalances**
and contrasts between the countries have been pointed out,]{.underline}
too many threats offered. [Trust has **been lost**]{.underline}.
Political careers are being made on both sides by acting tough towards
the neighbouring government.

#### Public perception of Trump is at an all-time low -- polling shows. Canada will [never]{.underline} cooperate with the US.

Canadians now see the U.S. as the country that poses the **top threat**
to their own]{.underline} -- a marked shift from 2019, when China was
most often named as the top threat. At the same time, more than half of
Canadians view the U.S. as the world's top economy, and two-thirds say
it's more important for Canada to have close economic ties with the U.S.
than with China. These findings come from a survey of 1,024 Canadian
adults conducted from Feb. 19 to April 15, 2025. [The survey was being
**fielded** as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney took office and after
Trump announced initial tariffs against Canada, China and
Mexico.]{.underline} How Canadians view the U.S. A line chart showing
that Canadian views of the U.S. are among their most negative in more
than 20 years of polling. About a third of Canadians (34%) have a
favorable opinion of the United States today. This is down 20 percentage
points since last year. Favorable views of the U.S. are now at their
lowest point since we started asking this question in 2002, tied only
with the 35% who had a favorable view of the U.S. in 2020, the final
full year of Trump's first term. [Nearly [two-thirds]{.mark} of
Canadians (64%) have an **[unfavorable opinion]{.mark}** of the U.S.,
including 39% who have a very unfavorable view.]{.underline} This is the
[highest percentage]{.underline} of Canadians [with]{.underline} a very
[unfavorable view of the U.S. in surveys dating back to
2002]{.underline}. Views of the U.S. vary by ideology among Canadians.
Those on the ideological left (17%) are less likely than those in the
center (32%) or on the right (52%) to view the U.S. favorably. However,
across all ideological groups, the share of Canadians with a favorable
view of the U.S. has dropped by about 15 percentage points or more since
last year. How Canadians view Trump Roughly a fifth of Canadians (22%)
have confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.
Last year, 52% had confidence in then-U.S. President Joe Biden. A line
chart showing that most Canadians lack confidence in Trump. Confidence
in the U.S. president is among the lowest it has been since we began
asking this question in 2003. But it is on par with the low levels of
confidence that Canadians had in Trump during much of his first term.
[When asked [about]{.mark} [Trump]{.mark}'s personal characteristics,
roughly **[nine-in-ten]{.mark}** Canadians (91%) [describe]{.mark}
[him]{.mark} as **[arrogant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, compared with 14%
who said the same about Biden during his first year in office. About
three-fourths of Canadians (76%) say Trump is dangerous, up from 15% who
said this about Biden in 2021. Canadians are also less likely to
describe Trump as a strong leader than they were to say this about Biden
(40% vs. 63%). When it comes to his handling of various global issues,
most Canadians lack confidence in Trump. For example, 74% do not express
confidence in Trump to handle global economic problems, including 57%
saying they have no confidence at all in him on this issue. Trump has
repeatedly threatened Canada with tariffs since the beginning of his
second administration. Canada sells about three-fourths of its goods to
the U.S. How Canadians view the U.S.-Canada relationship In two
open-ended questions, we also asked Canadians to name their country's
most important ally and its greatest threat. A 55% majority of Canadians
name the U.S. as their country's top ally. The UK is the second-most
common response at 17%. [But a [59%]{.mark} [majority]{.mark} of
Canadians also [name]{.mark} the [U.S. as]{.mark} their country's [top
threat]{.mark}. Most Canadians who say this perceive the U.S. as a great
deal of a [threat]{.mark} [to]{.mark} their country's [**economy**
(77%),]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [53%]{.mark} [say]{.mark} it is a great deal
of a [threat to]{.mark} their **[national
security]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On multiple occasions since winning the
election for his second term, [[Trump]{.mark} has [called]{.mark} for
[Canada]{.mark} to become "the **[51st state]{.mark}."**]{.underline}
After the U.S., China is the second-most common country that Canadians
see as a threat, named by 17% of respondents. This marks a major shift
from 2019, when we asked a slightly different but comparable question.
At that time 32% of Canadians named China as the top threat, followed by
the U.S. at 20%. Related: People in Many Countries Consider the U.S. an
Important Ally; Others See It as a Top Threat Which country do Canadians
see as the world's top economy? While most Canadians express negative
views about the U.S. and its president, a growing share also view their
southern neighbor as the world's leading economic power. A line chart
showing that a growing share of Canadians see U.S. as top economy. More
than half of Canadians (54%) say the U.S. is the world's leading
economy. This is the highest figure recorded since the Center started
asking the question in 2009, and the first time that significantly more
Canadians say the U.S. than China (which 31% of Canadians view as the
top economy). Since we last asked this question in 2023, the share of
Canadians who say the U.S. is the world's top economy has grown by 10
percentage points. In fact, Canada is the only country of 23 surveyed
where more people view the U.S. as the world's leading economic power
today than two years ago. Related: Views of the U.S. have worsened while
opinions of China have improved in many surveyed countries In Canada,
this change in perception has been driven primarily by people on the
ideological right. Around six-in-ten Canadians on the right (62%) now
see the U.S. as the leading economic power, up from 44% in 2023. Views
have not changed significantly among Canadians in the ideological center
or on the ideological left. How Canadians view economic ties between the
U.S. and China A line chart showing that two-thirds of Canadians
prioritize close economic ties with U.S. over China. When asked whether
it is more important for Canada to have strong economic ties with the
U.S. or China, two-thirds of Canadians prefer close ties with the U.S.
But this reflects a 20-point drop since 2021, the first year of the
Biden administration, when 87% of Canadians preferred strong economic
ties with their southern neighbor. Canadians across ideological groups
were broadly in agreement in 2021. But today there are large ideological
differences. In particular, Canada's ideological left is less likely
than the center and the right to prefer closer economic ties with the
U.S. Around six-in-ten Canadians on the ideological left (58%) prefer to
have strong economic ties with the U.S., compared with 67% of those in
the center and 76% of those on the right.

Some [**[senior officials]{.mark}** in Canada [say]{.mark}]{.underline}
it's [[time to **repair trade**]{.mark} **relations** [with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, arguing US tariff policy is pushing them to
deal with Asia's largest economy. Last year, the Canadian government put
tariffs of 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles and 25% on steel and
aluminum products, aligning with what the Biden administration had done.
The move also protected Canada's auto industry. China struck back with
retaliatory 100% tariffs on Canadian canola oil and pea products, and a
25% levy on pork and seafood --- a move that underscored the sharp
deterioration in ties between Beijing and Ottawa in recent years.
[Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, whose province is Canada's top canola
producer, said the [country must]{.mark} "**[reset]{.mark}** our
[relationship]{.mark} with China [if]{.mark} we are going to have any
**[hope of diversifying]{.mark}**."]{.underline} The US bought about
three-quarters of Canada's goods exports last year.
"[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is one of the largest markets in the
world. It's our [**[second-largest]{.mark}** trading
[partner]{.mark}]{.underline} as the province of Saskatchewan," Moe said
during an interview in Huntsville, Ontario, where he attended meetings
with other provincial leaders and Prime Minister Mark Carney. "They'll
need to be a part of that process." In a joint statement Tuesday,
[Canada's [premiers]{.mark} [urged]{.mark} Carney to "[improve]{.mark}
the overall **[trade relationship]{.mark}**" [with Beijing]{.mark} and
remove the tariffs]{.underline}. US Still Dominates, Even In a Trade War
Tensions have been building for years. In 2018, Canadian police arrested
Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer and daughter of the founder of
Huawei Technologies Co. That same month, China arrested two Canadians,
detaining them for almost three years. During his leadership campaign,
Carney called China the biggest threat to his country. [However, last
month he spoke with Premier Li Qiang about the trade disputes and told
reporters it's important that Canada **"re-open"** dialogue with
Beijing.]{.underline} Some Canadians say Washington has given them no
credit for aligning with US policy on China --- leaving Ottawa squeezed
between its two largest trading partners. British Columbia Premier David
Eby said in March: "[The initial tariffs that were put on by Canada as
an attempt to curry favor with the president, in my opinion, have not
had the intended effect]{.underline}. The [[president's]{.mark} been
completely [**indifferent** to]{.mark} our [policy]{.mark} towards
China]{.underline}, and in fact he doesn't seem to have any designs on
treating Canada better than China." Eby added: "It'll be
[[necessary]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [federal government]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} have a [look]{.mark} [at]{.mark} tariff [policy]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} respect to trading [partners]{.mark} around the world,
[understand]{.mark}ing [that]{.mark} [we don't]{.mark} want to
[get]{.mark} [crushed]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the [two biggest
economies]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}." He said he'd support
diversifying away from both the US and China and toward other markets.
Last month, he visited Asian countries, but not China, on a trade
mission. China Dominates Canada\'s West Coast Port Metric tonnes of
cargo handled at Vancouver, Canada\'s biggest port Wab Kinew, the leader
of another major agricultural exporter province, Manitoba, said he told
Carney that Canada must plot a path with "room to maneuver" amid the
tariffs from the US and China. US Dispute US President Donald Trump has
sidestepped the trade agreement he signed with Canada and Mexico during
his first term to impose levies on steel, aluminum and automobiles. He
has also put 25% tariffs on many other Canadian products if they aren't
shipped under the deal's rules, and threatened to raise that to 35%. His
actions have led to layoffs and business losses in the steel and auto
industries, sparking outrage among Canadians --- many of whom have
responded by avoiding travel to the US. Doug Ford, premier of Ontario,
Canada's auto heartland, said he's against removing tariffs against
Chinese electric vehicles, but he would have no problem doing more
business with China "as long as China plays fair and doesn't undercut
our markets." "[I don't consider Americans the enemy, but right now
President [Trump]{.mark} himself [is]{.mark} acting [like]{.mark} the
**[enemy]{.mark}**," Ford said.]{.underline} Moe said expanding trade
ties with other nations is about shielding Canada's economy over the
long run from protectionism. "[[In order]{.mark} for us [to]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} a serious amount of **[leverage]{.mark}** in that
conversation, you [need]{.mark} [to]{.mark} be able to **[access all
markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he said.

WASHINGTON---President [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} said he
[**[terminate]{.mark}d** [trade]{.mark} talks [with Canada]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} what he called]{.underline} an "[**[egregious]{.mark}**"
[digital-services tax]{.mark} on U.S. tech companies]{.underline},
plunging relations with America's second-largest trading partner back
into turmoil. "Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating
ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately," [Trump
wrote Friday on Truth Social]{.underline}. Trump's decision is the
latest blow to an already strained relationship between the bordering
nations. [Trump has said the U.S. should **annex Canada** to improve
trade relations and security]{.underline}. [Recently elected Canadian
Prime Minister [Mark Carney]{.mark} has [**staked**]{.mark} his
**[political reputation]{.mark}** [on pushing
back]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} He has said Canada isn't for sale.
"These are very complex negotiations and we are going to continue them
in the best interests of Canadians," Carney said as he left his office
in Ottawa on Friday. The two countries had been negotiating a new trade
deal for months. [[Trump and Carney]{.mark} **[clashed]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} dairy [tariffs]{.mark} and the digital tax last week
during a bilateral meeting at the Group of Seven summit in
Canada.]{.underline} Trump had grown furious that Canada refused to drop
the digital-services tax, according to a senior U.S. official. He gave
no warning to Canadian officials before publicly calling off talks in
his post, this official said. "Economically, we have such power over
Canada, I'd rather not use it, but they did something with our tech
companies...it's not going to work out well for Canada," Trump said
later Friday in the Oval Office. "[[We have **all the
cards**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on
CNBC that the U.S. Trade Representative could soon start a Section 301
trade investigation to determine the harm being done to the American
economy from Canada's trade practices. Canada's finance minister,
François-Philippe Champagne, earlier this month said the Canadian
government had no intention of scrapping the tax, despite U.S. pressure
to remove the levy. The first payments from tech companies to the
Canadian government over the digital-service tax, a levy on revenue
companies make from Canadian users, are due on Monday. The tax would
likely cost U.S. tech companies billions of dollars. It includes
retroactive taxes on sales going back to 2022, and industry groups
estimate the initial payment could total up to \$3 billion, with
subsequent annual payments north of \$1 billion. Tech companies have
pressured the Trump administration and lawmakers to take action for
months, worrying that other countries will follow Canada's lead. Taxes
on revenue made in other countries could reduce the amount of money the
tech sector can invest in the U.S., industry executives say. Google
owner Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are among tech companies most
affected by the tax, which applies to internet firms that meet certain
revenue thresholds. "We appreciate the administration's decisive
response to Canada's discrimination against digital commerce," said Matt
Schruers, chief executive officer of the Computer & Communications
Industry Association trade group. Opposition to digital taxes was one
factor that pushed tech executives to embrace Trump in his second term.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were among tech
leaders who attended his inauguration and whose companies put millions
of dollars into the inaugural fund. Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer
Joel Kaplan and Karan Bhatia, Google's global head of government affairs
and public policy, praised Trump on social media for Friday's action.
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement that Trump negotiated in his
first term allows Canada to impose tariffs on U.S. dairy products after
a set amount has been imported tariff-free. The levies are intended to
protect Canadian dairy producers and American farmers oppose them.
[Although [Canada]{.mark} [hasn't]{.mark} been [hit by]{.mark} Trump's
**[reciprocal tariffs]{.mark}**, the country is [subject to 50%
duties]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [steel and aluminum]{.mark}, as well as
tariffs on cars manufactured in Canada.]{.underline} The [U.S. has
[also]{.mark} imposed a [**25% tariffs** on]{.mark} all goods from
Canada]{.underline} that aren't compliant with the USMCA. Trump's Truth
Social post landed as Carney was meeting Friday afternoon with his
council on Canada-U. S. relations, a group of industry, policy and labor
leaders collected to advise on the trade negotiations. Canada depends on
U.S. trade for a fifth of its gross domestic product, and more than
three-quarters of its exports go to the U.S. "My advice to the Canadian
government is not to panic and to keep talking," said Brian Clow, who
was deputy chief of staff under former Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau. Carney and Trump had agreed at the G-7 meeting to set a 30-day
deadline to come to an agreement over the latest tariffs. Canada's
ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Wall Street Journal
this week that negotiators met four times last week and three times this
week. Canada wanted in the short term to address the steel and aluminum
and fentanyl tariffs, and leave more difficult issues like the DST and
dairy quotas for a more comprehensive round of talks when the USMCA, a
pact that covers the U.S. and its two largest trading partners, is
expected to come up for renegotiation.

unlike Ottawa, [Moscow is a **self-reliant** player]{.underline} in the
region, being [able to **independently choose** who to work
with,]{.underline} Russian Ambassador to Ottawa Oleg Stepanov told TASS
as he commented on a statement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney
that Ottawa did not plan to cooperate with Moscow in the Arctic.

\"Those [feelings are **mutual**]{.underline}. The [Russophobic policy
of the present liberal **cabinet**]{.underline}, which is temporary in
fact, [formed under the previous prime minister \[Justine **Trudeau**\],
does not allow Russia to see an **associate** in the matters of high
latitude in the Canadian side]{.underline},\" he said. \"But what is
important is that [Russia]{.underline}, unlike Canada, [is absolutely
self-reliant in the Arctic]{.underline}. We [can independently choose
who to keep company]{.underline} with there, and [who to
cooperate]{.underline} constructively [with]{.underline}, while [Canada
has **no such opportunity**]{.underline},\" the diplomat added.

Carney said earlier that Canada's authorities did not intend to
cooperate with Russia on the Arctic-related issues as it is not a
like-minded nation.

#### **Canadian coop with Russia is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--interests differ too greatly and Putin is [too agressive]{.underline}**

Over the past few weeks, [the **Russian** president's ambitions have
converged in the Arctic, **challenging Canadian** and allied
**interests** and dropping the **threat of conflict** with the Kremlin
directly on our northern shores. Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei
Lavrov,]{.underline} recently [warned Canada and other Western allies
that all the **resources** beneath]{.underline} the melting ice in the
[Arctic]{.underline} Sea [belong to]{.underline} the
[Russia]{.underline}n government.

[The Kremlin's **updated claim**]{.underline} to what Canadian Arctic
expert Ron Huebert defines as the "entire Arctic Ocean" [would extend
its undersea continental shelf]{.underline} right up [to
the]{.underline} 200-nautical mile [**exclusion zone** around Canada's
Arctic coast]{.underline}. If approved by the UN, the claim would allow
Russia to extract vast Arctic oil and other natural resources, adding to
the revenues of Russian kleptocrats who keep Vladimir Putin in power.

[The overtly hostile claim]{.underline}, made while the rest of the
world remains focused on the global pandemic, [represents a **clear
threat** to Canada's Arctic **sovereignty**]{.underline} and requires
much greater government and public attention.

[The dual hazard to Canada posed by Russia's rapid Arctic
**militarization** and expanding territorial claims]{.underline} can no
longer be dismissed as "out of touch," or as an "imaginary threat"
concocted by Canadians intent on sparking [an "**Arctic Cold
War**."]{.underline}

While Canadian policy-makers were distracted by the Kremlin's rhetoric
about Arctic cooperation, Vladimir Putin was busily preparing to exploit
the vast opportunities that are being unlocked by the melting Arctic
ice.

[In its **official** 2035 Arctic strategy document, the Kremlin outlines
plans for an **aggressive expansion** of Russian Arctic resource
development and]{.underline} a focus on expanding its [military
capabilities.]{.underline} Coupled with Sergei Lavrov's recent warning
that "it has been absolutely clear for everyone for a long time that
this \[the Arctic\] is our territory, this is our land," Vladimir Putin
has made his intentions very clear.

His Arctic ambitions first appeared in the late 2000s in the form of
rapid militarization and the development of special weapons designed to
secure its Arctic claims.

The Kremlin established an Arctic command in 2014 to re-organize its
offensive and defensive military assets, including 14 new military
airfields and 16 deep-water ports that have been built or restored in
the country's far North.

[A swath of new Russian "**super-weapons**" such as the Poseidon 2M39
torpedo, have been designed to support Putin's Arctic
aspirations]{.underline}. The Poseidon is a stealthy, nuclear powered
and autonomous long-range torpedo that can evade underwater detection
under Arctic ice to deliver a thermonuclear warhead to coastal targets.
It is clearly intended to augment Russia's offensive military
capabilities.

[While]{.underline} some [Canadian Arctic experts and **policy-makers**
have consistently called for **dialogue** with Moscow]{.underline} on
issues of common concern, [it's **hard to identify** which concerns
Canada might share with Putin.]{.underline}

[Advocates for Russian **Indigenous communities**]{.underline}, for
example, [face increasing political **repression**.]{.underline} Last
year, [the country's justice department labelled a]{.underline}
Moscow-based [NGO]{.underline}, the Russian Association of Indigenous
Peoples of the North, [a "foreign agent" due to]{.underline} its
[**links with Canadian** Indigenous rights organizations, and forced it
to **close down**. Its leader]{.underline}, Dmitry Berezhkov, [is now
living in **exile**]{.underline} in Norway after advocating for the
protection of Indigenous Nenets territory from environmental degradation
by Russian gas and oil giant Gazprom. According to the
[Russian]{.underline} environmental activist Yevgenia Chirikova,
[Gazprom's NordStream2 **pipeline** has **violated** the rights
of]{.underline} both the Nenets people and [Indigenous]{.underline}
Finno-Ugric [tribes]{.underline} in Western Russia.

Canadian policy-makers must wake up to the reality that [the **Kremlin
has no interest** in slowing the effects of **global warming** or
placing any constraints on the ability of Russian state]{.underline}
[companies]{.underline} and oligarchs [to **extract profits** in the
Arctic.]{.underline} While [Canada rightfully prioritizes the
environment and Indigenous affairs]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin does
not]{.underline}. Instead, the [Kremlin]{.underline} has
[prioritized]{.underline} the development of **[military
technology]{.underline}** designed to expand and secure its Arctic
claims and [to **threaten**]{.underline} those [Arctic
nations]{.underline} that challenge them.

Russian chess grandmaster and human rights activist Garry Kasparov told
me that "[Canadian policy-makers need to understand that]{.underline}
Vladimir **[Putin is not interested in cooperating]{.underline}** or
protecting the environment or Indigenous rights in the Arctic. [He will
**destroy**]{.underline} them there, as he has destroyed them in Russia,
[if they are **in the way** of his profits, and he will not hesitate to
**threaten Canada** either." Canada]{.underline}, Kasparov warns, "[can
only protect its interests by **standing up to Putin, not by appeasing**
him]{.underline}."

[In a world]{.underline} that is more and more geopolitically [turned to
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region, [Canada is]{.underline} at risk of
[seeing its]{.underline} traditional [strategic importance to the U.S.
**erode**]{.underline}. When the North Atlantic was the main "game in
town," Canada's role of trusted partner to the U.S. in dealing with
Europe was quite different from 21st century trade across the Pacific.

[Canada's absence from the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
Council]{.underline}, which has a strong China focus, [and the US-led
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is evidence of **Canada's shrinking
strategic value** in the eyes of the U.S.]{.underline}

It is not for lack of Canada trying to join these initiatives.

Add to this the fact that [policies harmful to international trade are

### Solvency\-\--Canada\-\--2AC

#### Canada can't solve -- lack of infrastructure and funding. 

Kaylia **Little '22**, Reporter for the Arctic Institute, PHD Candidate
in Sustainability Management at the University of Waterloo, "Iqaluit's
water crisis highlights deeper issues with Arctic infrastructure,"
Arctic Institute, 05-02-2022,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/iqaluits-water-crisis-highlights-deeper-issues-arctic-infrastructure/.

[Infrastructure]{.underline} is a [critical]{.underline} way for humans
[to engage with the]{.underline} natural environment in the
[Arctic]{.underline} region, as it [facilitates access, connection,
inhabitation]{.underline}, and [productivity]{.underline}. The Arctic
Institute's 2022 series on Infrastructure in the Arctic investigates
infrastructure as a critical point of analysis for considering human
impacts and needs in the Arctic, especially in its role as a mediator,
or as an interface, between politics, government, people and the natural
environment.​ Infrastructure in the Arctic is a topic that is growing in
importance. Due to the harsh climate and often remote nature of
settlements in the Arctic, communities struggle to have their basic
needs met. The [precarity of Canada's Arctic infrastructure]{.underline}
was [highlighted]{.underline} most recently [by]{.underline} the
[contamination of]{.underline} Iqaluit's [water supply]{.underline}. The
[slow reaction time]{.underline} to assess the situation
[and]{.underline} the slow [move to a solution demonstrates a gap in
Canada's Arctic security and disaster preparedness]{.underline}. Iqaluit
is a territorial capital, but it is often an afterthought of the Federal
government as demonstrated by the over two-year delay of Prime Minster
Justin Trudeau's first visit, which happened in 2017.1) This is further
validated by its housing crisis, subpar telecommunications
infrastructure, poor waste management, limited health infrastructure,
and now a water crisis created, in part, by a lack of understanding of
the infrastructure needs of the climate. As climate and environmental
changes increase the strain on already limited infrastructure, issues
like these will become more frequent. Addressing the water
infrastructure gap in the Canadian Arctic will require a well-funded and
climate-informed approach to ensure that it meets the needs of current
and future generations.

In early October 2021, residents of Iqaluit, Nunavut began to notice a
foul taste and smell coming from the tap water. Typically, the water in
Iqaluit is safe to drink. At first, reports were limited to a community
Facebook group, but eventually an official complaint was made to the
City of Iqaluit. The initial testing of the city's water supply found no
evidence of fuel or other contaminants. Residents were reassured by the
mayor that the water was safe to drink. This news received mixed
reactions, with some residents being reassured and others not convinced.
Complaints and worries continued to be shared on the community Facebook
group. The continued concerns led to a second round of testing of the
water supply, which revealed the presence of fuel in the water, making
it unsafe for drinking and even for bathing for babies and pregnant
individuals. For a remote community, this was a devastating blow, as
bottled water had to be flown in from southern Canada. The City of
Iqaluit and Government of Nunavut began distributing free water jugs and
bottled water. Others took to the Sylvia Grinnell River, which is a
trusted natural source of fresh water. After confirming the presence of
fuel in the water supply, it took two months for officials to find the
source of contamination, which was identified as a 60-year-old fuel tank
that was buried next to the water treatment plant. Due to the prolonged
water crisis, the Canadian military was dispatched to Iqaluit to set up
a temporary water treatment site on the Sylvia Grinnell River.2) In the
end, it [took over two months for the contamination to be identified and
removed from the water]{.underline} of Iqaluit. In January 2022, a new
"Do Not Consume" order was issued after fuel contamination was
discovered once again.3)

Infrastructure in the Arctic faces numerous challenges which directly
impact the quality of life and health of residents, as well as economic
development opportunities in the region. [Canada's Arctic
infrastructure]{.underline}, specifically the infrastructure in the
territorial capital of Iqaluit, [is aging and limited]{.underline}. As
noted by Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated's (NTI) 2020 infrastructure
report, the [gap between Nunavut and the rest of Canada is large and
widening]{.underline}. This gap is sometimes difficult to quantify
because the Canadian federal government does not collect data on all
forms of infrastructure in Nunavut, such as solid waste disposal.4) This
represents one of the [many challenges for sustainable
development]{.underline} in the North, as the [lack of reliable data
means there is no baseline]{.underline}. More specifically, according to
NTI's report, Nunavut's drinking water infrastructure is below the
Canadian national standards. NTI's assessment was in line with
Ecojustice's 2019 evaluation which gave Nunavut a "D" on its water
infrastructure, the lowest of any Canadian province or territory. The
low grade was due to its low water treatment standards and limited
infrastructure.5) Only 14% of Nunavummiut are served by piped water. 6)
Rankin Inlet, Resolute Bay, and parts of Iqaluit are the only Nunavut
communities served by piped water. The National Collaborating Centre for
Environmental Health states that the reason for Nunavut's reliance on
trucked water is due to the lower investment required for construction
and maintenance, although operating costs are higher.7) Furthermore, NTI
reported that [85% of Nunavut's drinking water infrastructure is in poor
condition]{.underline}.8) The [systemic under-funding and
under-investment in Nunavut's]{.underline} drinking water
[infrastructure]{.underline} [demonstrates]{.underline} a [lack of
commitment]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the [Federal
government]{.underline}. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the
Environment endorses the use of a multi-barrier drinking water
filtration system. However, none of the water plants in Nunavut utilize
this standard, instead relying on chlorination.9) In addition to the
subpar state of water infrastructure in Nunavut, the cost of operating
and maintaining these systems is ten times the national average.10) The
combination of deteriorating infrastructure and high operating costs
mean that investments in [upgrades are not feasible due to underfunding
from the Federal government]{.underline}.

Water crises like the recent fuel contamination are not new to residents
of Iqaluit. In 2019, the City of Iqaluit spent \$330,000 in two and a
half weeks thawing frozen water pipes.11) The freezing of the pipes was
directly caused by climate change, the effects of which are much more
apparent in polar regions. Instances like these are becoming more
frequent in Iqaluit, which declared water emergencies in both 2018 and
2019 due to historic lows in the City's potable water reservoir, Lake
Geraldine. These emergencies were caused by a combination of low
precipitation, leaking infrastructure, and population growth.12) The
government of Canada acknowledges in its Arctic and Northern Policy
Framework that the Canadian Arctic is warming at three times the global
average.13) The [Framework]{.underline} discusses funding investments in
transportation, education, and nutrition -- all much needed areas of
investment but it [does not provide specific targeted funding for
increasing the safety and resiliency of water
infrastructure]{.underline} in Arctic and northern communities. Although
Goal 2 of the Framework is "Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps
with other regions of Canada", there is [no mention of improving
drinking water infrastructure in the North.]{.underline}

Estimates from the City of Iqaluit in 2019 stated that a full
replacement of the city's piped water system would cost \$55.2 million,
with another \$106.3 million budgeted for road upgrades for the parts of
the city that receive trucked water.14) For comparison, the total budget
for City was only \$83.2 million (operating and capital budgets
combined).15) In June of 2021, the Nunavut Housing Corporation estimated
that the price of building material in Nunavut had increased by 40% to
50% since 2020.16) With the increasing cost of materials, it is
appropriate to assume that the upgrade estimates from 2019 would be at
least double, if not more. The price Iqalummiut pay for underinvestment
in water infrastructure is not insignificant. A new bypass system was
installed as a result of the water emergency in 2021, which cost
\$100,000 and is only for temporary emergency use.17) In November 2021,
the federal New Democratic Party leader, Jagmeet Singh stated in a
speech in Iqaluit that the latest estimate to fix the City's water
infrastructure was at least \$180 million.18) The [increase in cost and
lack of action]{.underline} by the Canadian federal government continues
to [demonstrate]{.underline} an [absence of commitment to the Canadian
Arctic]{.underline}.

While [**Russia and China** continue to invest heavily in **polar
infrastructure** and operational capability, successive governments have
allowed **Canada's Arctic** to become **increasingly vulnerable,**
posing a **significant security threat** that can no longer be
ignored]{.underline}, says a Senate report released on Wednesday.

Speaking to an Ottawa news conference, Senate National Security, Defence
and Veterans Affairs committee chair Tony Dean outlined some of
[**Russia's** military investments over the last decade]{.underline}
which [include]{.underline}s more than [**10 operational military
bases** in the Arctic, **nuclear sub**marines that can patrol under ice,
and an arsenal of **hypersonic missiles** that North America cannot
defend]{.underline} against.

"There are [serious questions about **NORAD's capacity** to
monitor]{.underline} these [threats]{.underline} and to thwart them," he
said. "[Tracking]{.underline} these [weapons will **require upgraded**,
space-based satellite surveillance systems, operating alongside new
ground-based, over-the-horizon radar systems]{.underline}. Our report
emphasizes the urgency of procuring and activating these new defensive
systems."

Set up in 1958 during the Cold War, NORAD's mandate was to provide
aerospace warning and control against Soviet aerial threats to North
America. Maritime warning was added to its mandate in 2006, but [experts
have long sounded the alarm over the **inability** of the system to keep
up with new weapons technologies.]{.underline}

Canada needs to outline approach to Arctic deterrence

In January, Ottawa announced it would acquire 88 new F-35 fighter jets,
delivered in stages, to replace the aging F-18 fleet by 2032, and better
deliver on the country's NORAD and NATO commitments.

Earlier, in October 2022, the [government announced]{.underline} \$4.9
billion over the [next **six years** to modernize]{.underline}
continental defence, but [the lag until that's completed leaves Canada
**vulnerable**]{.underline} and needs to be addressed, the Senate study
said.

Recommendations include annual reports from the Government to Parliament
on budget, potential delays and procurement issues, as well as how any
problems are being addressed.

In addition, the committee recommends the response to NORAD's weaknesses
be part of the Government's next defence policy which would "....
outline Canada's approach to deterring adversaries in the Arctic,
including during the expected "gap period" between when adversaries
could deploy new weapons systems and when the North American Aerospace
Defense Command will have the technology to detect them."

Indigenous communities seeing climate change impacts first hand

The committee's report, Arctic Security Under Threat: Urgent needs in a
changing geopolitical and environmental landscape, was compiled over 12
months from March 2022 to examine the state Canada's Arctic defence and
security.

During the study, the committee held hearings in Ottawa, fact-finding
trips to the Canadian Arctic as well as visiting the headquarters for
the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

The report stressed the need for a major investments in Arctic
infrastructure, some of which could be dual-use, and would benefit the
country's remote northern communities, many of which are experiencing
the effects of climate change first hand on their buildings, lands and
hunting routes.

"When the committee travelled to Tuktoyaktuk, I showed them where houses
once stood that had to be moved because our Arctic coastline is
eroding," Senator Dawn Anderson, a member of the Subcommittee on Agenda
and Procedure, said in a statement.

"The situation is beyond urgent --- it is desperate. Canada has taken so
much from us in the name of Arctic sovereignty. Without concrete action
now, I fear what may come."

Armed Forces deserve better, senators say

The committee praised the dedication and ingenuity of the Canadian Armed
Forces but said they'd been under-resourced in the North and didn't have
what they need.

Climate change has made the Arctic more accessible and great powers like
China have become increasing interested in the region's resources and
strategic potential, the report said, saying Canada has no choice but to
be proactive.

"We can no longer ignore the threats to our sovereignty," Senator
Pierre-Hugues Boisvenu, member of the Subcommittee on Agenda and
Procedure, said in a statement.

"[Foreign powers are already **testing**]{.underline} our
[resolve]{.underline}, whether [in the air through **spy balloons** or
on the water through monitoring buoys]{.underline}. We are [too
**dependent** on the **United States** for Arctic defence]{.underline}
--- we must live up to our responsibilities as a northern country."

Canada, recognized as a middle power, plays a significant role in Arctic
governance and international relations. As an Arctic state and member of
the Arctic Council, Canada is committed to environmental protection and
sustainable development in its Northern territories. However,
**[Canada\'s geopolitical position]{.underline}** also [exposes it to
**cyber vulnerabilities**, which have become increasingly relevant in
present-day international politics]{.underline}\[xiv\]

[Cyber threats pose significant risks to Canada\'s **national security,
economy,** and **critical infrastructure**]{.underline}, and all of
these are [particularly susceptible to changing conditions in the
fragile and remote regions of the **Canadian
Arctic**]{.underline}\[xv\]. [As a **highly digitized economy**, Canada
relies heavily on information and communication technologies (ICT),
making it susceptible to cyber espionage, ransomware attacks, and
misinformation campaigns]{.underline}. [The **sparsity** in the network
of government agencies, businesses, and citizens in the North
**amplifies** the]{.underline} potential [impact of cyber
incidents]{.underline} on Canadian society\[xvi\].

[Canada\'s role as a **middle power**]{.underline} in an era displaying
some characteristics of a return to great power politics [amplifies its
**vulnerability** in cyberspace]{.underline}. While not a major global
military power, [Canada\'s participation in international peacekeeping
missions and **diplomatic engagements** makes it a]{.underline}
potential [target for **state-sponsored cyber attacks**. Adversarial
states]{.underline} may [seek to exploit Canada\'s cyber vulnerabilities
to **gather** **intelligence**, disrupt operations, or **undermine
public trust** in democratic institutions]{.underline}\[xvii\]. Once
again, [all these vulnerabilities are **multiplied in the Arctic** where
Canada has been **unable** and/or unwilling to **solidify sovereignty**
over its vast Northern territory.]{.underline}

In response to these challenges, Canada has prioritized cybersecurity as
a national security imperative. The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
(CCCS) coordinates efforts to protect against cyber threats, enhance
resilience, and promote cybersecurity awareness among government
agencies, private sector entities, and the general public\[xviii\].
Collaborative initiatives with international partners, including NATO
and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, strengthen Canada\'s
cybersecurity posture and mitigate risks in a globally interconnected
digital landscape.

[Canada\'s dual role as an Arctic stakeholder and middle power
underscores the **interconnected** nature of **Arctic and cyber**
politics. Addressing cyber vulnerabilities is **essential** to
safeguarding Canada\'s national interests and **upholding** its
commitments to international **cooperation** and security.]{.underline}

State Adversaries and Their Involvement in Arctic and Cyber Realms

State adversaries play a pivotal role in shaping Arctic and cyber
politics through strategic investments, military activities, and cyber
operations. The intersection of these domains reflects broader
geopolitical ambitions and rivalries among global powers.

Russia, as a prominent Arctic state, has pursued an assertive Arctic
policy aimed at expanding its territorial claims and securing access to
strategic resources. The Russian military has modernized its Arctic
infrastructure, establishing military bases and conducting large-scale
military exercises in the region\[xix\]. These actions underscore
Russia\'s commitment to safeguarding its Arctic interests and projecting
power in the North.

[In the cyber domain, **Russia** has been accused of engaging in
state-sponsored **cyber operations** targeting]{.underline} Western
democracies, including [Canada]{.underline}\[xx\]. [Russia has employed
cyber espionage, disinformation campaigns, and disruptive cyber attacks
to influence public opinion, undermine democratic processes, and gather
sensitive information]{.underline} about both its partners and
adversaries\[xxi\]. The integration of cyber capabilities into Russia\'s
broader geopolitical strategy highlights the dual use of technology for
both defensive and offensive purposes.

Similarly, [China has emerged as a significant player in Arctic affairs
and cyberspace.]{.underline} Despite not being an Arctic state, China
has shown interest in the region\'s economic potential and maritime
routes. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China seeks to
enhance infrastructure connectivity and expand global trade networks,
including Arctic shipping routes\[xxii\]. This economic ambition aligns
with China\'s broader strategy of global influence and resource
acquisition.

In cyberspace, [**China** has been accused of conducting **cyber
espionage** against Western countries to steal intellectual property,
gain technological advantage, and influence global governance
structures]{.underline}\[xxiii\]. The integration of cyber capabilities
into China\'s foreign policy toolkit reflects its growing assertiveness
in international relations and its willingness to challenge established
norms and institutions.

State adversaries\' involvement in Arctic and cyber realms underscores
the complex interplay between geopolitics, technology, and national
security. Understanding these dynamics is essential for Arctic Council
members and other stakeholders to navigate challenges, mitigate risks,
and promote cooperative solutions in both Arctic and cyber domains.

The increased relevance of Arctic and cyber politics in the 21st century
reflects profound shifts in global dynamics driven by climate change,
technological advancements, and geopolitical rivalries. The Arctic
Council serves as a critical platform for multilateral cooperation among
Arctic states, despite challenges posed by environmental changes and
geopolitical tensions. [Canada]{.underline}, as a middle power, [faces
cyber vulnerabilities that intersect with its Arctic interests,
highlighting the interconnected nature of contemporary international
politics]{.underline}. State adversaries, such as [**Russia and China,
leverage Arctic and cyber** domains to advance strategic interests and
influence global governance]{.underline}, underscoring the importance of
addressing these multifaceted challenges through diplomacy, innovation,
and international cooperation.

#### **Canada's security is irreparable\-\--internal reports prove**

[The **Canadian government's** ability to track foreign vessels through
the Arctic is **woefully inadequate** and the situation may **get
worse**, according to a new report by the Auditor General of
Canada.]{.underline}

[**Domestic surveillance** of the region is **incomplete**,
data]{.underline} that'[s]{.underline} collected is
[insufficient]{.underline}, and [there is no effective way of **sharing
information** on maritime traffic]{.underline}, the watchdog said.
Meanwhile, [new icebreakers, aircraft, satellites and **infrastructure**
required to fix these problems have been **delayed** to the point where
some equipment likely will be **retired befor**e it can be
**replaced**.]{.underline}

"[**Federal organizations** that are responsible for safety and security
in the Arctic region **do not have a full awareness** of maritime
activities]{.underline} in Arctic waters [and are **not ready to
respond**]{.underline} to increased surveillance requirements," said the
report from Auditor General Karen Hogan.

[The Arctic is warming roughly **four times as fast**]{.underline} as
the rest of the world, [opening the region to increased traffic for
cargo, tourism or military purposes. The number of **voyages** through
Canada's Arctic]{.underline} more than **[tripled]{.underline}** between
1990 and 2019, the auditor notes, and is expected to continue
increasing.

[The report examined five government organizations]{.underline}
responsible for surveillance in Arctic waters --- [the Department of
National Defence, the **Canadian Coast Guard**, Transport Canada,
Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and Environment and Climate Change
Canada]{.underline} --- to determine whether they're capable of dealing
with security and safety risks caused by more vessels.

While the problems have been identified, for the most part, [actions
**haven't been taken** to fix]{.underline} them, the auditor found.

For example, [**satellites monitoring** Canada's Arctic territory
**can't meet** all the federal demands for radar imagery]{.underline}.
Those same satellites are [expected to reach the end of service **long
before** replacements arrive]{.underline}, Hogan's report said.

That could [leave Canada with limited surveillance capacity "**for
years**,"]{.underline} the report warns, which "would likely [increase
Canada's **reliance on** its **allies**]{.underline} for surveillance
information."

Recent challenges to the free and open international order present an
unprecedented need for middle powers to cooperate. Despite this, [a
prisoner's dilemma fuelled by]{.underline} seemingly **[diverging
national interests]{.underline}** continues to **[prove detrimental to
substantial middle power concerts]{.underline}**.

[US-China]{.underline} strategic [competition represents a classic great
power rivalry]{.underline} centred in the Indo-Pacific. China's
accelerated economic and military expansion has established it as a
near-peer competitor to American primacy in the Indo-Pacific, creating a
bipolar power dynamic reminiscent of previous great power
confrontations. This structural shift demands a comprehensive national
security response by middle powers focused on maintaining regional
alliance structures and strategic advantages.

According to Graham T. Allison's Thucydidean paradigm, great power
dynamics operate on the principle that "right is only in question
between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak
suffer what they must." This principle informs the classical realist
logic that has become foundational to middle powers, and the strategic
imperative to maintain robust regional alliance structures and preserve
key operational advantages across all domains. [The might-is-right
nature of great power politics underscores why **power equilibrium,
not**]{.underline} merely **[normative appeals, remains
foundational]{.underline}** to current security architecture. Great
powers exercise decisive influence over regional security considerations
and can shape strategic outcomes. By contrast, [middle and small powers
must navigate]{.underline} within [established equilibria, possessing
**limited capacity** to affect systemic change independent of major
power frameworks or multilateral mechanisms]{.underline}.

Middle power cooperation: a classic prisoner's dilemma

Hierarchical stratification within the international system yields not
only great and small powers, but also middle powers occupying a critical
intermediate position. These middle powers---exemplified by Japan,
Australia, or South Korea---possess meaningful agency to shape regional
dynamics and advance select strategic priorities despite operating below
the threshold of great power status. With substantial economic leverage
and diplomatic influence, for instance, Japan represents a tier of
states that remain consequential actors whose alignment decisions and
capability development significantly impact middle powers' strategic
calculus and regional security architecture. Australia's Lowy Institute,
for instance, categorises several countries in the Indo-Pacific as
middle powers with varying degrees of influence.

Although middle powers have a relatively limited influence on their own,
by working together they can and do exercise a substantial amount of
influence on world affairs, recently exemplified by the economically
influential and standard-setting Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement
for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), where middle powers like Japan,
Australia, and Canada took over the initiative in negotiations after US
withdrawal. Working together, however, is not as easy as it may sound.
Collective action problems fundamentally challenge interstate
cooperation at the international level. [The prisoner's dilemma
paradigm]{.underline}---which explains how mutual cooperation yields
optimal aggregate outcomes but also that individual defection presents
irresistible incentives absent credible enforcement
mechanisms---[permeates global governance challenges. As coalitions
expand]{.underline}, the [diversity of]{.underline} national [interests
increases proportionally, elevating the risk of **strategic divergence**
and **coordination failure**]{.underline}.

[Countries targeted by]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's tariff
regime face a]{.underline} classic prisoner's dilemma
[trade-off]{.underline} with significant strategic implications. [If
middle powers]{.underline} such as Japan or Canada [maintain a unified
resistance, they might compel policy recalibration]{.underline} by the
Trump administration. Additionally, the United States could also exploit
preference heterogeneity among these states, employing differential
pressure to fracture potential cooperation. This bilateral approach,
favoured by the current administration, leverages US market power
asymmetries against individual states, demonstrating how structural
power advantages can systematically undermine collective action even
among capable middle powers when facing a determined great power.

Limits of liberal institutionalism in the 2020s

[Increasing tensions in the Indo-Pacific warrant significant
**coop**eration]{.underline} between middle powers in the region in
order to sustain the political status quo, [yet it continues to prove
difficult due to **divergent national interests**]{.underline}. On 27
April, reports emerged of Chinese attempts to assert ownership of yet
another disputed land formation in the South China Sea. The small reef
known as Sandy Cay Reef is simultaneously also claimed by the
Philippines and Vietnam, and is notably close to Thitu Island on which
the Philippines has substantial military installations, including a
runway. Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea continues largely
unopposed, despite the UNCLOS ruling against it.

The Trump administration's [tariffs]{.underline} across the Indo-Pacific
[have revealed **critical vulnerabilities** in middle power coordination
mechanisms. Despite compelling mutual interests for]{.underline}
preserving [regional economic architecture]{.underline}, traditional [US
allies]{.underline} Japan and South Korea have recently [engaged in a
years-long trade dispute]{.underline} with the US, [and consistently
**defaulted to bilateral accommodation** rather than]{.underline}
developing [autonomous multilateral frameworks]{.underline} that would
enhance their collective bargaining position. [This **persistent
failure**]{.underline} (in this instance) [to form a cohesive middle
power coalition]{.underline}---even among advanced economies with
complementary security interests---[underscores]{.underline} the
[**structural constraints** that limit the horizontal cooperation of
many states when critical relationships with]{.underline} both [the US
and China are]{.underline} simultaneously [at stake]{.underline}.

The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 offers another important example of the
limits of cooperation between smaller powers. Despite Ukraine being
geographically located in Europe, the US has been, for the most part, a
major benefactor of the country while unsuccessfully asking Europe to do
more. The EU, arguably the most successful vehicle for cooperation
between states, has been hindered time and again by member states whose
interests clash with the majority. Hungary, for example, has stopped
financial aid to Ukraine more than once.

[The unipolar moment has come to an end following the emergence of a
revisionist China]{.underline} as a centre of gravity for the region's
integration and a resurgent Russia. This is further [exacerbated by
the]{.underline} increasing [reluctance of the US to]{.underline}
continue to [sustain the status quo by disrupting international trade
regimes and questioning its relationship with allies]{.underline}. These
uncertain times require well-functioning middle power cooperative
coalitions to ensure the stability of the free and open international
order endures, but it remains to be seen if any serious efforts emerge
in the near future.

[The **failure of middle power concerts** to emerge and deal with
Trump's tariffs illustrates the prisoner's dilemma at play]{.underline}.
To date, [middle powers have been pursuing national interests almost
**entirely unilaterally**. This shows that international order has
**undeniably returned to power politics, where the strong do what they
can and the weak suffer what they must**]{.underline}.

### No Middle Powers\-\--1AR

#### The concept is [empty]{.underline} and [outdated]{.underline}.

The concept of a 'middle' class of states is a common-sense category,
given the prominence of hierarchical categorization within social and
scientific analysis. 16 [Yet the [grounds for distinguishing]{.mark}
states within [this middle band has proven
**challenging**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the doyen of middle power
studies Carlsten Holbraad complained, '[nobody has]{.underline} quite
[overcome the]{.underline} serious [difficulties of providing an
entirely satisfactory definition]{.underline} of the type of power that
is neither great nor small'.17 This critique reflects two unusual
features of the middle power concept compared to many other concepts in
international political theory. First, it rose to prominence in the 20th
century through the work of policymakers. Second, it has always been
easy to identify 'who' was a middle power, but hard to pin down 'what' a
middle power was.

Many historical accounts of the international system from antiquity to
the 19th century feature secondary states under a variety of labels. 18
This [pluralism changed in the mid-20th century with the emergence of
the]{.underline} '[middle power]{.underline}' [concept]{.underline}. As
the Second World War drew to a close, two western states, Canada and
Australia, desired a role in post-war decision making. Their officials
argued that states with a 'functional' role that contributed to the
maintenance of peace, security, economic, and social stability, deserved
institutional recognition as the 'moderately powerful' compared to the
'utterly powerless'. 19 During negotiations for the United Nations,
Canadian officials put forward a new concept, 'middle power' to
represent this international and institutional role. 20 Canada and
Australia's bid for representation in the United Nations Security
Council ultimately failed, however their effort galvanized an emerging
identity for a distinct group of western states which scholars soon
embraced.

During these years, from the 1940s to early 1960s, scholars focused on
the nature and meaning of the middle power role in the multilateral
environment and promoted their contribution to the maintenance of peace
and order. 21 Empirically, research concentrated on Western liberal
states, predominantly Canada. A practitioner--scholarly nexus developed
during these years, which proved mutually beneficial to both sides. This
period saw the emergence of the functional definition, as an effort by
policymakers and scholars to argue these states could contribute to
international, multilateral forums to address common problems. Implicit
within this distinction was a willingness to uphold the post-war order
under American leadership, through institutions such as the United
Nations. 22 [[Who could be a middle power]{.underline}]{.mark} was thus,
from the start, less about a dispassionate identification of the
hierarchical position or power of states, and instead
**[[reflected]{.mark} their [alignment with the]{.mark} emerging [US-led
liberal order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Variations of the functional
definition have continued to emerge over the years, such as in the work
of Cooper 23 and Teo, 24 all emphasizing a distinct role for middle
powers in support of multilateral institutions.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, [scholars]{.underline}
revised their methodological framework, embracing new quantitative
research methods to measure and define the middle power concept under a
hierarchical definition. These scholars [sought to embed the study of
middle powers into realist and liberal theoretical
frameworks]{.underline}, and modestly increased geographic coverage and
subject matter. [Though still largely endorsing **Eurocentric notions of
who fit the concept**]{.underline}. 25

[The hierarchical definition]{.underline} of middle powers
[should]{.underline}, in principle, [have]{.underline} the clearest
[objectivity via quantitative rankings of material
capabilities]{.underline}. Yet most scholars who have used this approach
demonstrate an implicit selection process in their work. For a start
[[there is **nothing**]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[[middle]{.underline}]{.mark}**' **[[about]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
ranking of the [**middle powers**. [Canada and Australia]{.mark}, the
classic middle powers]{.underline}, generally [appear between [8th and
15th in]{.mark}]{.underline} various global [lists of [economic size or
military capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}. This could not be classified as
the 'middle' in a world of 143 states in 1960 and makes less sense in
2023 with 195 states. Second, even within an 'upper second tier' of
states [there are [consistent exclusions in]{.mark} the]{.underline}
middle power [**lit**erature on non-quantitative grounds]{.underline}.
States which appear very close to Australia and Canada in hierarchical
rankings, for example [[Russia, Brazil, or Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} --
the 11th , 12th , and 18th largest economies, respectively, in 2022 --
[have]{.underline} almost [never been seen]{.underline} by policymakers
or most academics [as middle powers]{.underline}. Similarly states with
a strong quantitative claim in one important area, such as Saudi Arabia
(ninth in military spending) or Pakistan and Nigeria (fifth and seventh
largest in population) are also commonly excluded.

As Holbraad26 observed during the 1980s, [hierarchical methodologies
produced a]{.underline} 'highly **[heterogenous group]{.underline}** in
almost every significant respect'. Some decades later, Ping27 also
highlighted the 'discordance between the realities of the hierarchical
states system' and the predictions of middle power theory, a discordance
due in part to the 'domination of the scholarship by Western
interpretations'. While Ping's work, centred on political-economy offers
a rare systematic counter-example, the use of the hierarchical
definition of middle powers in the literature has consistently been
shaped by a series of implicit normative selection choices, reflective
of the ideals of late 20th century western liberalism.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the Cold War wound down, scholars
were now willing to make explicit what had been implicit in the earlier
literature -- [[middle powers were defined by]{.underline} t]{.mark}heir
[[adherence to]{.underline}]{.mark} a set of characteristic **[[western,
liberal behaviours]{.underline}]{.mark}**.28 Declining great power
competition and the apparent victory of liberal internationalism, it was
argued, had re-opened space for the middle powers and re-enforced the
strong normative presumption with which the field began. In a rightly
acclaimed work in 1993, Andrew Cooper, Richard Higgott, and Kim Richard
Nossal proposed the 'behavioural' definition of middle powers, which
brought the three embedded assumptions directly to the surface and
celebrated the normative contribution of these characteristics.29 The
behavioural definition was quickly established as the most popular
approach to identifying middle powers and remains so to this day.

The policy--scholarly nexus around the middle power concept was
reinvigorated during this period. There was co-evolutionary conceptual
development and a common advocacy by scholars and practitioners for the
international significance of middle power countries. 30 The behavioural
definition's conceptual honesty, making explicit what earlier
definitions had kept implicit came with a cost. The behavioural
definition has also been the most heavily attacked by scholars on the
grounds of its empirical utility. 31

By the early 2000s optimism for middle power contributions had begun to
fade, and scholarly dissatisfaction with the concept rose. Again,
policymakers seemed to take the lead, helping push forward the
application of the middle power concept on the grounds of the
self-identification of states. [[States]{.mark} around the
world]{.underline} increasingly [[claimed middle power status seeking
association with its]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[[prestigious]{.underline}]{.mark}**' status and
**[[history]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 32 Accelerating through the 1990s
and into the 2000s, this pattern brought a welcome geographic and
cultural diversity to the use of the middle power concept by both
policymakers and scholars. Exemplifying this trend was the creation in
2013 of MIKTA, a handful of G-20 states that, after being excluded from
the G8 and BRIC groupings, embraced the 'middle power' identity. Their
foreign ministers characterized this identity as reflecting a 'common
interest in strengthening multilateralism, supporting global efforts for
stability and prosperity \[and\] facilitating pragmatic and creative
solutions to regional and global challenges'. 33

While scholars have accepted the 'identity' definition as one of the
four main definitions -- alongside functional, hierarchical, and
behavioural -- take up remains light. 34 Instead, the academic
literature in the 2000s and 2010s reflected a curious mix of boosterism
and anxiety. Where some spoke ambitiously of new coalitions and a
'renaissance' of the middle power concept, 35 other scholars proposed
significant reforms in an attempt to revive middle power theory. 36
These reforms however have proven ill-fated. While well cited and
debated, few have been taken up in a significant manner across the
literature.

The most insightful [efforts of [middle power
scholarship]{.mark}]{.underline} in recent years [have]{.underline}
largely **[[sidelined]{.underline}]{.mark}** questions of [[defining and
theorizing]{.mark} middle power status]{.underline}. Instead, it
explores the policy adaptions to the evolving international structure of
the early 21st century,37 or applies concepts from related fields, such
as the insightful use of role conception in foreign policy
formulation.38 While many works in this era retain an optimism about the
potential of these states, the [lack of consensus and proliferation of
new frameworks [demonstrates a **common anxiety** about]{.mark} the
**[theoretical utility]{.mark}** of the middle power
concept]{.underline}. This is seen most clearly in the diversity of
proposals and concerns within edited volumes such as Gilley and O'Neil
39 and Struye de Swielande et al. 40 One notable example comes from two
leading middle power scholars, Gabriele Abbondanza and Thomas Stow
Wilkins who suggest the middle power concept applies 'only' to Canada
and Australia. 41 In its place, they propose a category of 'awkward
powers' to capture the range of states which are somewhat 'in the
middle' powerwise, but for whom the middle power label, with its
associated western liberal baggage is not appropriate (such as Brazil,
India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia). This is a useful and
thoughtful contribution, but [[by narrowing]{.mark} the middle power
label [to]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[a tiny
category]{.underline}]{.mark} of states, [[its long-term utility must be
**significantly questioned**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Simply identifying as a middle power does not make them [effective]{.underline}.

Thus [[there is **no consensus** on middle powers' ability to
shape]{.mark} the region's [trajectory, let alone provide an
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline} regional [vision, [or even consensus
on]{.mark} whether they can increase [regional **coop**]{.mark}eration
[or are]{.mark} sought-after [pawns manoeuvred by]{.mark}]{.underline}
the two [[superpowers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Accordingly,
[[research]{.mark} specifically [dealing with middle powers'
roles]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific [is **small**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
extent [[and **provides an unclear verdict**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Moreover, since such states are generally described as pursuing
cooperative foreign policies,16 and thriving in multipolar contexts,17
this article's focus on a cross-section of middle powers as a collective
category is particularly significant in consideration of the
increasingly volatile and multipolar strategic landscape of this region.
Against this backdrop, the article seeks to address this gap in the
literature on middle powers and the Indo-Pacific, while shedding light
on the complex mechanisms driving the region's strategic competition. In
order to do so, it aims to clarify middle powers' visions and related
strategies for the Indo- Pacific beyond a restrictive view of narrow
Sino-American competition.

### No Middle Powers\-\--AT: Multilat

#### Small state leadership [fails]{.underline} to [bind states]{.underline} to multilateral initiatives.

Ngaire **Woods 23**, Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government and
Professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford,
LL.B. from the University of Auckland, D.Phil. in International
Relations from the University of Oxford, "Multilateralism in the
Twenty-First Century," Global Perspectives, Vol. 4, No. 1, 2023,
https://doi.org/10.1525/gp.2023.68310

A third and final force shaping multilateralism is the delicate balance
between power and consent that underpins multilateral cooperation in a
world of sovereign states. [The [participation of powerful states
has]{.mark} historically [been secured]{.mark}]{.underline} (or not)
[[by giving them special rights]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example,
although the United States stayed out of the League of Nations in the
1920s, a reluctant United States was persuaded to join the United
Nations, the IMF, and the World Bank after the Second World War, not
least because it was given a say over leadership, the hosting of their
headquarters, and a special voice and influence in decision-making (the
"veto" power in the Security Council, and weighted voting power in the
IMF and the World Bank).

[[Powerful countries]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [have to
[accept]{.mark}]{.underline} some **[[constraints]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in order [to persuade and co-opt other countries to participate in
institutions]{.underline} in which the powerful have a particular voice.
And even from their own point of view, international organizations only
have value-added to the extent that they are distinct from unilateral or
bilateral means. In cases where the United States has publicly sought
unilaterally to push an international organization to do its bidding,
the case has been made that it best advances its own interests by
enabling the international institution, as eloquently laid out with
respect to the IMF by Randall Henning (Henning 2009). In another
example, in the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, an
"accountability framework" has been carefully crafted to balance the
control by management (to whom some loan decisions are delegated) with
the oversight of the board, on which sit representatives of the
countries who are members (who evaluate the performance of the
president).

Rigorous governance arrangements are the most obvious way the
"multilateral" character of an agency is entrenched. Member countries
can hold the institution and its management to account through their
formal representation on the board, through rules about staffing and
funding, and through decision-making processes that give all members a
voice. Unsurprisingly, the process of decision-making in multilateral
institutions is often laborious and lengthy.

Avoiding laborious institutional processes is tempting for powerful
states who often opt to use smaller coalitions of the powerful instead.
Sometimes this has positive results. Historically, it's worth recalling
that in the early nineteenth century, a Concert of Great
Powers---Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, and France---convened
extensive multilateral consultations through which they settled
rivalries and agreed, for example, on the neutrality of Belgium and
Greece.

Informal negotiations and summits were important during the Cold War for
containing the superpower rivalry. For example, the July 1955 summit
that brought the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United
States, the United Kingdom, and France together in Geneva to discuss
European security, disarmament, and East-West relations did not result
in any formal agreement, but did lead to what was described as a "Geneva
spirit" of willingness to engage in a limited way. The resolution of the
Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1977--78 US-USSR agreement that the USSR
would limit its engagement in Somalia offer further examples of
structured informal talks.

Bilateral agreements were also useful, including at times of high
tension. For example, the Soviet Union and the Western occupying powers
(the United States, France, and the United Kingdom) agreed on the
Austrian Independence Treaty and Austria's neutrality in 1955. In 1962
the Soviet Union and the United States signed the International
Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos. Later in the Cold War (signaling
what would be called the détente), the superpowers agreed treaties that
included arms restraints, including the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
(ABM), in force 1972--2002; the Strategic Arms Limitation Agreement,
signed in 1972; the Accidents at Sea Agreement of 1972; and the Berlin
Quadripartite Agreement of 1971. Less effective were efforts to engineer
broad-based agreements, such as Nixon and Brezhnev's Basic Principles
Agreement of 1972.

The [[limitations of small group governance]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[are **manifold**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [when the
small group attempts to set binding rule]{.underline}s for all other
countries. Consider the following three challenges to the legitimacy and
efficacy of small group governance.

First, [[small groups]{.underline}]{.mark} often [**[fail]{.mark}**
adequately [to balance]{.mark} the [different interests]{.mark} of
countries whom international standards will affect]{.underline}. For
example, the Basel Committee was formed in 1974 to formulate global
standards for the prudential regulation of banks. It is a small grouping
of the governors of Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States, with
Switzerland playing a hosting role. They are ["like[-minded
countries]{.mark},"]{.underline} and they have in common the fact that
they are the jurisdictions of the world's major financial services
companies. Yet these two features [[increase the risk]{.mark} that [the
group will be **blindsided**]{.mark} by risks]{.underline} that would be
[more apparent if a wider range of countries]{.underline} (with
different interests) [were at the table]{.underline}. And indeed, in
2008 the financial crisis exposed that their banking sectors had "too
much leverage and inadequate liquidity buffers.... poor governance and
risk management, as well as inappropriate incentive structures. The
dangerous combination of these factors was demonstrated by the
mispricing of credit and liquidity risks, and excess credit growth"
(Bank for International Settlements 2022).

[A second drawback of [small group governance]{.mark} is]{.underline}
that [it **too often [excludes info]{.mark}**rmation [about how]{.mark}
standards or [rules]{.mark} will [affect all
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Continuing the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) example from above, evidence from developing countries
highlights that the [standards]{.underline} created by the BIS have
significant [impact]{.underline} on [countries **not included** in their
deliberations]{.underline}, and not figuring in their analysis or
attention (Jones 2020). A different example is the global tax deal
pushed by the G7, brokered by the OECD, and formally agreed by the G20
leaders in October 2021. The deal seeks to curb tax avoidance by large
multinational enterprises (MNE) and introduces new taxing rights
irrespective of an MNE's physical location, and a new global minimum
corporate income tax of 15 percent on the largest MNEs. The problem, as
expressed by countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka
who refused to sign the agreement, is that these [[rules have been
designed with little attention to]{.mark} their effect on [countries
**other than the**]{.mark} **small [group]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
wealthy countries [**[who drove the process]{.mark}**. The failure more
fully to analyze and balance the consequences for other
countries]{.underline} has [[resulted in a deal that will
**disadvantage** the countries who suffer most]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
disproportionately, from tax avoidance (McCarthy 2022). Developing
countries may find that the global minimum tax could actually lead to
tax revenue being lost to other jurisdictions (Lassourd 2022).

A final limitation to [[coalitions of the willing]{.underline}]{.mark}
is that they **[[short-circuit]{.mark}]{.underline}** the process of
[[getting]{.mark} a [larger]{.mark} number of countries to [buy
in]{.mark} and feel ownership of a rule or an action. This is
[**precisely** what makes **multilat**]{.mark}eralism
**[onerous]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but ultimately more effective. [The
[costs of not engaging]{.mark} a wider group of countries [can be
**high**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, actions to condemn and
punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine were initially undertaken by
the United States and a small group of allies. The results have been a
sanctions regime applied by too few countries to be effective, and the
previously mentioned eighty-two countries that abstained or voted
against the resolution against Russia in the United Nations (Woods
2022). Another example is [the G7]{.underline}, which was created in the
1970s as a forum to coordinate the policies of major economies in the
wake of the US departure from the Bretton Woods system. By the late
1990s, the G7 membership (United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom,
France, Canada, and Italy) [**failed** to include countries whose crises
were affecting the G7 and whose **coop**eration and resources were
required to address the crises]{.underline}. After the 1997 East Asian
financial crisis, a more inclusive G20 meeting of finance ministers was
formed. A couple of decades later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, [the
G20 was]{.underline} itself [criticized for its **lack of
representativeness** and **legitimacy**]{.underline}. Advocates of a
UN-wide approach to health threats argued that a small group of wealthy
countries within the G20 had commandeered most available vaccines during
the COVID-19 pandemic, and had failed to support the COVAX mechanism
they themselves created to ensure that at least frontline health workers
across the world could be vaccinated.

[[Smaller groups]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the G7 and the G20 have
usefully functioned as "crisis committees" for consultation at speed in
a crisis. The [[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark} of these groups, and
other ad hoc coalitions of the willing, [[come to]{.mark} the [fore when
they]{.mark} attempt to **[define]{.mark} actions or [rules for other
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} who have
**[[neither]{.underline}]{.mark}** been **[[consulted nor had their
interests]{.mark} properly [considered]{.mark}]{.underline}** and taken
into account.

Multilateralism gives a structured form to negotiations,
decision-making, implementation, and enforcement, which assists in
navigating between the sheer power of great powers and their need to
co-opt other states.

some of Canada's most important [diplomatic relations]{.underline}. This
should set alarm bells off in Washington. If Canadian and U.S. foreign
policy remain this misaligned, the consequences for America could be
serious.

Consider, for instance, how Canada and the U.S. have approached India
and Israel. Both New Delhi and Jerusalem are critical pillars of the
global democratic architecture. Both face relentless threats from
nonstate actors and revisionist regimes. Both are central to the future
of democratic cooperation.

India is a key partner in pushing back against China's Indo-Pacific
dominance, while Israel is the only liberal democracy in the Middle
East.

The U.S. has, for the most part, treated both Israel and India with
consistency and clarity. After the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, America
affirmed Israel's right to self-defense while engaging actively on
humanitarian concerns. Likewise, when hitmen allegedly linked to the
Indian government assassinated in British Columbia Hardeep Singh Nijjar,
a leader in the Sikh separatist movement, Washington remained cautious
and disciplined, allowing its intelligence agencies to manage the matter
discreetly while protecting its strategic partnership with India.

[Canada]{.underline}, by contrast, [flinched under domestic
pressure]{.underline} in both cases, [allowing diaspora politics and
electoral calculations to distort its diplomatic posture, souring
relations with]{.underline} two of its most [important
allies]{.underline}. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's public accusation
of Indian state involvement in Nijjar's killing derailed already fragile
ties, [leading]{.underline} Indian Prime Minister Narendra [Modi to
harshly criticize Canada and shun Trudeau]{.underline} at the 2023 G20
summit.

A similar drift is evident in Canada's response to Israel's war with
Hamas. Ottawa initially condemned the terrorist attacks. But in the face
of rising domestic protest and activist pressure, the government's
stance became incoherent --- a muddled blend of contradictory U.N.
votes, hedged statements and an inability to affirm basic principles
such as Israel's right to self-defense. Canada's new prime minister,
Mark Carney, has even echoed the charge that Israel is committing
genocide in Gaza.

Beyond weakening key strategic alliances, [Canada has **not communicated
a clear vision** about the world's most pressing conflict
zones]{.underline}. For instance, [Ottawa]{.underline} has [repeatedly
capitulated to]{.underline} demands from [the Chinese government, while
remaining]{.underline} shockingly [noncommittal when it comes
to]{.underline} defending [Taiwan]{.underline} from a possible Chinese
invasion. [**Waffling like a feather in the wind**, Canada
was]{.underline} also [the last member of]{.underline} the [Five
Eyes]{.underline} intelligence alliance [to ban Chinese
government-connected companies]{.underline} Huawei and ZTE [from its 5G
networks]{.underline}. And while Beijing continues to carry out
everything from widespread foreign interference operations to espionage
to executing Canadian citizens on Chinese soil, Canadian officials seem
fine focusing on "positive developments" between the two countries.

[On Ukraine]{.underline}, statements of support are clear, but
**[material and financial assistance is lacking]{.underline}**, and
[Canada has]{.underline}, once again, [**avoided any clear long-term
strategy** for the region]{.underline}. And despite a storied history of
peacekeeping, demilitarizing war zones and brokering peace agreements,
[Ottawa's approach to Israel's]{.underline} multifront [war]{.underline}
in the Middle East [is **virtually nonexistent**]{.underline}.

Going forward, Canadian leaders must rediscover that [trust and
reliability mean treating allies and issues not as political footballs,
but as long-term partners and problems in a dangerous multipolar
world]{.underline}. If they do not, America might have to make some
tough decisions.

For instance, if Canada cannot be trusted to fully back Israel in its
greatest time of need, can America count on Canada as a credible
security partner? Further, if Canada fails to muster up the courage to
more forcefully confront China, Washington will have no choice but to
reevaluate everything from economic ties to defense cooperation with
Ottawa. [Canada]{.underline} also [continues to **spend a pittance not
just on its own military, but on support for key allies**]{.underline}
such as Ukraine and alliances like NATO. In time, this could increase
pressure for the U.S. to make up for Canada's shortcomings --- something
it should not be expected to do.

All told, while the U.S. under President [Trump]{.underline} has made a
number of shocking [blunders]{.underline} when it comes to allyship and
global engagement, that **[does not excuse the strategic dysfunction of
countries like Canada]{.underline}**. In fact, it probably requires
allies such as Canada to step up and play an outsized role to preserve
the order we've long taken for granted under U.S. leadership.

At a time when the U.S. faces serious global challenges and the stakes
are this high, **[a confused and reactive Canada is one liability
America cannot afford]{.underline}**.

### Canada Fails\-\--1AR

#### They're [indifferent]{.underline} towards leadership.

Toronto, "Realism, Romanticism, or Indifference? Canada's Geostrategic
Choices in an Era of Great-Power Rivalry," in *Canada and Competing

But there is a third pole that we have seen emerge at different times in
Canadian history---what the international relations scholar Arnold
Wolfers theorized as the "pole of indifference." Wolfers argued that
while some states might evince "a frantic concern for the enhancement of
power," it was possible, at least theoretically, that [some
states]{.underline} could [demonstrate a]{.underline} "**[complete
indifference]{.underline}**" **[to power]{.underline}**. Indeed, he
cited the Canadian-American relationship as an example of such
indifference at work (Wolfers 1951, pp. 56 and 57). But it can be argued
that [Canadian indifference to power]{.underline} often [goes well
beyond North America]{.underline}. In this view, [Canadians
are]{.underline} essentially **[unconcerned about global
politics]{.underline}** more broadly. [This can]{.underline} perhaps
best [be seen in electoral outcomes. Canadians]{.underline} tend to
[elect]{.underline} Members of Parliament ([MPs]{.underline}) who are
[committed to an]{.underline} "**[a-strategic]{.underline}**"
**[approach]{.underline}** to global politics (Nossal 2016)---in other
words, [they have little inclination to grapple with]{.underline} the
[hard geostrategic choices]{.underline} about how best to respond to
great-power politics; instead, [they]{.underline} prefer to [concentrate
their attention on **highly local issues** like reducing auto theft, or
solving housing shortages]{.underline}, or "growing the middle class."

In this view, [indifference impels Canadians to **avoid spending their
wealth on global politics**. They]{.underline} certainly [do not want to
spend on]{.underline} the [hard power resources]{.underline} that are
[required]{.underline} by the needs of Realpolitik. Instead, for much of
their history Canadians have adhered to the geostrategic wisdom of David
Mills, a Liberal MP from Ontario, who in 1875 outlined his particular
"security imaginary" (Nossal 2010) to the House of Commons:

> In a country situated as we are, not likely to be involved in war, and
> having a large demand upon our resources for public improvements, it
> \[is\] highly desirable to have our military affairs conducted as
> cheaply as possible. (quoted in Morton 1987, p. 643)

In just thirty-nine words, Mills captured the core reasons why Canadians
have the attitudes they do toward defense. [Canada's geostrategic
location]{.underline}---sep[arated from the rest of the
wor]{.underline}ld by three oceans, [with a harshly inhospitable polar
region]{.underline} on its northern approaches [and the United
States]{.underline}, a dominant and now hegemonic power, [as its
southern neighbor]{.underline}---[means]{.underline} that [Canadians
have the **extraordinary luxury** of being able to devote their wealth
to things other than defense]{.underline}, so that whatever defense
needs to be done can---and should---be done on the cheap. It is clear
that successive generations of Canadians have agreed. But [if Canadians
are complacent about national security, neglectful of the armed forces,
indifferent to great-power politics, and]{.underline}, above all,
[cheap]{.underline} and unwilling to spend [on international affairs, it
is because **history has shown them that**]{.underline}, given Canada's
geostrategic location in North America, **[they do not need to take
defense seriously]{.underline}**. As the historian Desmond Morton has
pointed out, Canadians have never suffered from the indifference that
they have persistently exhibited to global politics (Morton 1987, p.
628).

**[Nor do Canadians want to spend the money]{.underline}** that a
romantic "do-good" **[foreign policy requires]{.underline}**. As a
result, Canadians who are indifferent to power politics also tend to
favor a romantic version of foreign policy that costs as little as
possible. As Gotlieb put it, we have seen the move from "a do-good to a
feel-good foreign policy" (Gotlieb 2005, p. 18), [with Canadian voters
rewarding politicians who spend little on]{.underline} foreign and
[defense]{.underline} policy, [but instead treat international policy as
**performative politics**, feeding back to their constituents a romantic
foreign policy]{.underline}---**[fanciful tales of Canada's role in the
world]{.underline}** that are [pleasing to Canadian ears and make
Canadians feel good about themselves]{.underline} (Stairs 2003a, 2003b;
Nossal 2005).

#### They lack diplomatic firepower, and other countries don't like them.

[Canada possesses significant diplomatic resources]{.underline} around
the world, with an international presence in about 180 countries in
embassies, consulates, or commissions. Canada's trade commissioners and
diplomats interact with business and political contacts at multiple
levels in seeking to promote trade and investment and advance Canada's
broader interests. Global Affairs Canada also employs public diplomacy
efforts to enhance Canada's image abroad and promote Canada and the
"Canada brand."

[Consistency and stability **have not been a hallmark** of leadership at
Canada's foreign ministry]{.underline}. Canada's current foreign
minister is the fifth in six years. In December, [Canada's
Senate]{.underline} published a report asking whether Canada's foreign
service was "fit for purpose." The report [noted]{.underline} that [the
**lack of investment and recruitment** in Canada's diplomatic capacities
and capabilities]{.underline} has **[undermined Canada's ability to
influence and shape global issues and effect change]{.underline}**
(Senate of Canada 2023). In this context, Global Affairs Canada recently
announced a three-year transformation plan to help ensure it is properly
equipped to meet the global challenges Canada faces now and into the
future (Global Affairs Canada 2023a). Through the IPS, capacity is also
being established abroad and in Canada to support expanded regional and
bilateral engagement, including new foreign service positions created
and staffed in various Indo-Pacific countries and additional
China-related capacity (Global Affairs Canada 2024).

[Despite being the country that literally invented]{.underline} the
modern concept of [peacekeeping, Canada]{.underline} currently [ranks
70th on the UN list of peacekeeping personnel, contributing fewer than
60]{.underline} uniformed personnel to UN peacekeeping missions (United
Nations 2023). Canada recently declined a request from the United States
to send a peacekeeping force to Haiti which is wracked by gang violence,
noting that it lacks the capacity to do so.

[Canada's track record on agenda-setting has been a **mix of successes
and failures**.]{.underline} Canada in recent years has developed a
reputation for global leadership in promoting universal human rights, an
open international trading system and strengthening the rules-based
international order. In response to the "two-Michael's" affair, Canada
exerted effective leadership in marshaling international support for the
Declaration on Arbitrary Detentions and demonstrated leadership in
finalizing a global biodiversity agreement in Montreal in 2022. On the
other hand, [Canada failed to secure a UN Security Council seat on two
consecutive bids]{.underline}, under both the current and previous
governments. 11 [Canada]{.underline} also [**suffers from poor
diplomatic relations** with]{.underline} two of the world's largest
countries, [China and India, both of whom are critical to Canada's
future]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific.

#### Large powers [don't listen]{.underline}. 

Andrew **Latham 24**, Professor of International Relations at Macalester
College, Senior Fellow at the Institute for Peace and Diplomacy, Ph.D.

diplomacy no longer works in China," The Hill, 08-06-2024, accessed

https://thehill.com/opinion/international/4811666-canadas-middle-power-diplomacy-no-longer-works-in-china,
DG

In an increasingly multipolar world, [the siren song of Canada's middle
power diplomacy has]{.underline} effectively [been **drowned out by**
the noise of **great power competition**]{.underline}. The rise of
[China]{.underline}, the resurgence of [Russia and]{.underline} the
ongoing [assertiveness of other regional powers]{.underline} have
[created a complex and challenging international
environment]{.underline} in which [Canada's traditional approach is
**ill-suited** to advance its interests]{.underline}.

Moreover, [Canada's middle power status has been]{.underline} further
[eroded by]{.underline} the [declining]{.underline} influence of
[**multilat**eral institutions]{.underline}, a key arena within which
Canada once pursued its middle power diplomacy. The rise of [nationalism
and protectionism, coupled with the]{.underline} increasing
[assertiveness of non-Western powers, has undermined the efficacy of
traditional multilateral forums]{.underline}. As a result, **[Canada's
ability to shape global outcomes]{.underline}** through multilateral
cooperation **[has been largely diminished]{.underline}**.

Similarly, [with respect to regional security]{.underline} issues,
[Canada]{.underline} simply [lacks the **standing, leverage and moral
authority** to engage]{.underline} China [in a serious
negotiation]{.underline} around Indo-Pacific security. [Canada is **not
a consequential**]{.underline} regional security
**[player]{.underline}** in the Indo-Pacific. Or, put slightly
differently, Canada is not now and likely never will be an Indo-Pacific
"middle power" in the current sense of that term --- that is, a power
defined by its rootedness in the Indo-Pacific region, by its
considerable economic and military capacity relative to other
Indo-Pacific states or by its historical and cultural pedigree as a
member of the Indo-Pacific civilization.

This being the case, nothing Foreign Minister Joly said to Foreign
Minister Wang on the topic of global or regional security is likely to
have had the slightest effect on China's grand strategy, regional policy
or global military posture. If she did raise these issues, it would have
been the diplomatic equivalent of, in the words of one Chinese proverb,
"playing a harp to a cow."

So, [unlike during the]{.underline} long-past [heyday of Canadian middle
power diplomacy, in today's world, **no one**]{.underline} --- and
especially not Beijing --- **[pays any attention whatsoever to what
Ottawa has to say about global and regional security
issues]{.underline}**.

To be sure, this is painful for Canadians to accept. But it is the hard,
cold reality that they must acknowledge and embrace if they actually
want to advance and defend their national interests in the real world.
[To cling to nostalgic notions that Canada is an indispensable middle
power that punches above its weight on the international stage is
**hallucinatory**]{.underline}.

I hope Joly devoted all of her time in Beijing to addressing key
bilateral issues related to Canada's narrow national interests. And I
hope she did so in a way that did not make her sound like the foreign
minister of Yelang.

#### Lack of defense spending undermines their credibility.

Mail, "Declining stature of foreign affairs minister underscores
Canada's waning influence on world stage," Fraser Institute, 06-02-2025,

In the cabinet he unveiled in May, Prime Minister Mark Carney appointed
Anita Anand to serve as this year's foreign affairs minister.

Yes, that's tongue in cheek. Anand may well serve longer than one year
in that role. Her predecessor, Mélanie Joly, served three-and-a-half
years, almost as long as John Baird who served from May 2011 to February
2015. But those two were exceptions to what has become a revolving door
ministry. [In this century, 15 people have served as minister of foreign
affairs]{.underline}.

Some of this has to do with the six minority governments we've had in
Ottawa over that time. But the bigger reason is that **[Global Affairs
Canada]{.underline}**, as it is currently known, **[no longer has the
stature it once enjoyed]{.underline}**, in part because foreign policy
is directed more and more from the Prime Minister's Office, and
[because]{.underline} "**[Canada\'s standing in the world has
slipped]{.underline}**," as Marc Garneau, who was foreign minister for
nine months in 2021, wrote in his memoir. \"We are losing credibility.\"

The minister of foreign affairs was once seen almost as a Canadian
equivalent of an American vice-president. Louis St. Laurent, Lester
Pearson and Jean Chretien all served at foreign affairs before later
becoming prime minister. Joe Clark served as foreign affairs minister
after having been prime minister.

And Canadian foreign policy once mattered in world affairs. Pearson
played a key role in the negotiations that led to the creation of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. He was the only
Canadian to win the Nobel Prize for Peace, after he helped broker a
ceasefire during the 1956 Suez Crisis that led to the first peacekeeping
mission.

During her brief tenure as foreign affairs minister in 1979, Flora
MacDonald promoted the idea of bringing Vietnamese refugees to Canada
through private sponsorships by citizens and groups. The United Nations
awarded Canada the Nansen Refugee Award for accepting more than 60,000
boat people, as they were known, from Indochina.

Joe Clark, as External Affairs minister in the 1980s, put Canada in the
forefront of opposition to the apartheid regime in South Africa.

At the turn of this century, foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy led the
movement that brought about the United Nations doctrine of
Responsibility to Protect---a global commitment to prevent genocide and
other atrocities.

And following the attacks on 9/11, Foreign affairs minister John Manley
worked closely with Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge to secure the
Canada-U.S. border, while continuing to promote free trade across it.

Since then, the stature of foreign affairs ministers has declined. Bill
Graham was deeply disappointed when Paul Martin replaced him as minister
with Pierre Pettigrew, whom Martin kept on a very short leash.

Stephen [Harper cycled through a plethora of foreign affairs
ministers]{.underline}---Peter MacKay, Maxime Bernier, David Emerson,
Lawrence Cannon, Baird and, in the final months, Rob Nicholson.

Justin [Trudeau did the same]{.underline}, replacing Stéphane Dion with
Chrystia Freeland, then François-Philippe Champagne, then Garneau and
finally Joly.

Part of this is the way of the world. In foreign affairs ministries
everywhere, from Foggy Bottom to Whitehall to the Quai d'Orsay,
diplomats lament that the office of the head of government effectively
runs foreign affairs, shunting them aside.

But [the declining stature of the Canada's minister of foreign affairs
coincides with the **declining stature of Canada within the Western
alliance and beyond**, which itself is the result of the **decline in
Canda's defence capability**]{.underline}.

In the 1950s, during the Korean War, Canada's defence spending reached
7.4 per cent of GDP. On John Diefenbaker's watch it sat above 4 per
cent; on Pearson's, around 3 per cent.

Pierre Trudeau reduced the size and role of Canada's military, while
seeking to make Canada less closely aligned with the United States. He
took defence spending down to 2 per cent of GDP, where Brian Mulroney
kept it.

[With the end of the Cold War, and]{.underline} with [the need to
balance the federal budget, defence spending]{.underline} under Jean
Chretien and Paul Martin [fell]{.underline} to about 1 per cent of GDP,
where it largely remained under Stephen Harper and Justin Trudeau.

[Other members of NATO are investing heavily]{.underline} in their
military in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But **[Canada
continues to lag behind]{.underline}**.

Prime Minister Carney promises to increase Canada's defence commitments
while pursuing a more robust foreign and trade policy. We shall see. In
any case, Anand should not get too comfortable in her office at the
Pearson building. If past is precedent, she may not be there long.

#### Lack of influence and inability to coerce other countries.

However, [Canada]{.underline} has [**slipped as a middle power**. The
nation has faced a **continuous loss of influence**]{.underline} as
[shown in its failure to earn a]{.underline} United Nations [Security
Council seat]{.underline} (ibid., 3; Kemp 2023, 2). [Canada
has]{.underline} also [taken a **massive step back** in]{.underline} its
approach to [foreign policy]{.underline} as [the nation **lacks a clear
sense of direction**]{.underline} on foreign policy [and is]{.underline}
instead [producing reactive policy with **ad-hoc
approaches**]{.underline} (Kemp 2023, 4). [This]{.underline} slip in
international status [puts an even greater hinderance on the nation's
ability to use its hard power resources]{.underline}. For example,
Canada's [hard sanctioning capacities are **completely ineffective** due
to]{.underline} compounding factors of [Canada's step back as a middle
power and]{.underline} Canada's **[lack of economic or military
resources to coerce countries]{.underline}** into changing their
behaviour (Nault 2017, 11). Moreover, as a nation that still pretending
to operate as a middle power, [Canada struggles with the moral
implications of]{.underline} employing "blunt" [sanctions]{.underline}
that can lead to human rights violations in the targeted country
(Elliott 2016, 177-78; Biersteker, Tourinho and Eckert 2016, 272).
Violating human rights and negatively impacting other nations
contradicts the middle power position of upholding peace and security,
which has historically shaped the Canadian political identity (Hynek
2004, 36). Lastly, hard sanctions can disrupt Canada's social network
and create friction between Canada and its biggest allies (Nault 2017,
9, 28). [This creates extreme volatility since the world has continued
to shift toward a greater multilateral approach, creating greater
connections]{.underline} between nations [and putting Canada in a tricky
situation when attempting to take the lead on multilateral initiatives
such as hard sanctioning]{.underline} (Kemp 2023, 1).

### Canada Fails\-\--Military

#### They don't spend enough on their military.

[Making an impact and contribution to the balance of power]{.underline}
in the Indo-Pacific [is an acute question given Canada's **laggardly
commitment to NATO** and]{.underline} generally **[threadbare defense
policy]{.underline}**. Two problems challenge Canada's contributions in
the Indo-Pacific: the first is a lowball commitment to defense spending
and readiness; the second is our traditional focus on the North
Atlantic. Canada's colonial history with Great Britain and France and
commitment to the British Empire continuing right up to the Second World
War largely determined the North Atlantic anchor of our foreign and
defense policies (Nossal 2018). As far back as the Second World War,
Prime Minister Mackenzie King made the decision to concentrate our
efforts on Europe and the North Atlantic a decision which continued a
long legacy into the NATO era. In an extended period of constrained
defense spending and commitment, [NATO interoperability enmeshed and
focused Canada's military efforts along with]{.underline} a [continuing
commitment to]{.underline} continental defense through the North
American Aerospace Defense Command ([NORAD]{.underline}). **[The Pacific
was always an add-on]{.underline}**. In addition, [the vastness of the
Pacific and the distinct]{.underline} configuration of [our Pacific
coastline]{.underline} (a comparatively short straight-line distance
[squeezed between the lower 48 states]{.underline} of the United States
[and the Alaskan panhandle]{.underline}) [means]{.underline} that [there
can be no easy equivalence between the North Atlantic and the North
Pacific i]{.underline}n terms of [responsibility and commitment to
trans-oceanic sea-lanes. While Canada]{.underline} has [long claimed a
role as a Pacific nation and has recognized the growing importance of
the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} in world trade and investment, [this
was]{.underline} largely [spoken of in terms of]{.underline}
"**[opportunity]{.underline}**" **[rather than as a commitment and
responsibility]{.underline}** (Paltiel 2017). Canada's commitment to
NATO is strong, and in some sense existential, as a core part of
Canadian identity through Pearsonian internationalism. The problem is
that **[it does not feel a sufficient threat to do more than the
necessary to spend on defense]{.underline}**.

#### Its military is pathetic.

[**Low military capability** is perhaps Canada's weakest point in its
middle power]{.underline} diplomatic [engagement]{.underline} within the
Indo-Pacific. The reality is that [Canada has the Atlantic, the Arctic,
and Pacific]{.underline} oceans [to deal with]{.underline} in terms of
security challenges, and [the Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [is going to
increasingly be an area of geopolitical competition as climate change
opens up the sea lines of communication]{.underline} not only to
shipping but also to increased Chinese and Russian assertive behavior as
they aim to secure and dominate the natural resources that exist in that
region. Although more populous than Australia, [Canada]{.underline},
surrounded by three oceans, [is **financially limited** in terms of how
much]{.underline} resources [it can provide for a military
footprint]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific region. Consequently, this
chapter advocates a capabilities- based approach to engage within the
region and primarily geographically locating that in the eastern part of
the Indo-Pacific, along the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait,
and South China Sea, the primary zones of economic interests of Canada
within the broader Indo-Pacific region. Plugging into the Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue or other agreements is an important example of how
Canada can add value to the region within the context of its limited
capacities (Nagy 2021).

### Canada Fails\-\--Nuclear Power

#### Canadian nuclear program is bad

**Spencer-Churchill 25** -- (Julian Spencer-Churchill, 05/16/2025,
associate professor of international relations at Concordia University,
director of the Canadian Centre for Strategic Studies and former
Canadian Forces captain., "Bombs away: A Canadian nuclear weapons
program to deter Trump is not feasible", Policy Options Politiques,
https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/may-2025/canadian-nukes/)

However[, there is no possible way from a political, strategic or
technical perspective to develop a successful Canadian
nuclear]{.underline} deterrent [without creating other serious domestic
and international problems. In fact, such a move would almost certainly
backfire.]{.underline}

We have the necessary resources

Canada has an abundance of the necessary inputs, including 15 per cent
of global production of uranium-238, as well as lithium, beryllium,
lead, graphite and 19 CANDU reactors at three sites (which uniquely can
be refuelled without shutting off the fission process, thus facilitating
the measured production of plutonium-239).

Most of the required mining, refining, milling and waste management take
place in northern Saskatchewan, while there are research facilities in
six of the 10 provinces.

Marc Garneau, the former transport minister and technology champion,
once gave a presentation to my class on Canada's endo- and
exo-atmospheric rocketry, which is mostly designed for meteorological
research but which also demonstrates engineering competence.

Too easy to detect

However[, there is no chance of hiding a nuclear]{.underline} weapons
[program.]{.underline}

[Manufacturing the infrastructure to produce plutonium or to enrich
uranium would be immediately noticeable to the U.S., as well as the
International Atomic Energy Agency.]{.underline}

[Isotope decay products leading to plutonium create easily detectable
Krypton-85 gas. Enrichment centrifuges emit radiofrequency waves that
are difficult to shield. All other enrichment methods either consume
noticeably large quantities of energy or rely on specialized equipment,
such as calutrons.]{.underline}

Although South Africa employed fewer than 20 engineers to manufacture
its six warheads within a large dual-use infrastructure, its attempted
test was immediately detected by satellites of the U.S.S.R. In addition,
Pretoria's purchase of Israeli intermediate-range ballistic missiles was
quickly known by U.S. intelligence.

The nuclear dilemma

There are some other important truths to consider.

First, second-strike nuclear arsenals are the basis of military and
national power, and the U.S. wields great influence through the
provision of its nuclear umbrella to its allies.

While nuclear weapons cannot occupy territory like an army can, they can
shatter the economy of the great powers sufficiently to expose them to
conquest by their neighbours.

A United States de-urbanized and de-industrialized by a major
city-busting Russian or Chinese nuclear strike would be unable to
replace or maintain its navy, which is so vital to assert its sphere of
influence over North America. Conventional forces permit more
fine-grained applications of deterrence and force, but integration with
tactical nuclear forces is doctrinal and theoretical, never having been
tested in battle.

Second, U.S. nuclear power does not depend solely on retaliatory
capability, which is termed immediate deterrence, but also on having an
arsenal so large that potential adversaries do not even try to start a
nuclear program, which is called general deterrence.

[If Canada were to seek nuclear]{.underline} weapons [capability, it
would undermine the psychological deterrent effect of a large U.S.
arsenal and could even lead to nuclear programs in Brazil, Argentina or
Mexico, or a purchased Venezuelan or Cuban arsenal.]{.underline}

Be careful what you wish for

Trump's 51st state threats reveal that Canada has an immature national
security culture. Much like the Liberal government's bewildered response
to the Quebec referendum in 1995, Canadian political leaders lack a
clearly articulated survival strategy for the nation when under stress.

Much recent anti-Americanism in Canada is driven most by economic
concerns related to tariff negotiations, highlighting the lack of a
sense of proportion of many Canadians.

It is because of centuries of harsh historical experience that Russian,
Chinese, French and Polish citizens, for all their jingoism, are more
confidently calm when confronting security threats and war.

Grade school history texts celebrate how stalwart Canadians resisted the
U.S. invasion in the War of 1812, but Canada was mainly lucky that the
U.S. was divided over the issue of war. Alfred Thayer Mahan's regarded
account shows how anglophile New England critically sabotaged the U.S.
war effort, with Boston grain merchants clandestinely feeding the Royal
Navy ships blockading the port of Boston.

A losing proposition

[A formal Canadian nuclear program, designed to assure its citizens,
would instead excite anti-Americanism to new heights and would likely
provoke a physical and irreversible U.S. intervention.]{.underline}

The manifest lack of political will in Ottawa means that politicians
could not credibly threaten retaliation against a U.S. incursion,
defeating the purpose of a nuclear arsenal in the first place.

Any weaponized nuclear program would also require a dramatically
militarized security regime that would disproportionately undermine
Canadian freedoms.

Even possession of a latent pre-assembly capability would make Canada an
easy target of nuclear espionage and fillip to nuclear proliferation.

It was low confidence in Canada's ability to protect from espionage the
design plans of the infamous CF-105 Avro Arrow that led to its
shredding.

International issues would arise

[The foreign relations implications of a Canadian nuclear]{.underline}
weapons [program raise other important questions.]{.underline}

Would Canadian armed forces that are deployed abroad extend our nuclear
umbrella to host nations, such as Latvia?

Where would Canada deploy nuclear weapons? Hudson Bay provides a vast
and easily secured ballistic missile submarine bastion. But at only 100
metres deep, submarines would be vulnerable to detection by
wake-analyzing satellites and air drones equipped with magnetic anomaly
detectors (MAD).

Washington would not appreciate nuclear-armed submarines patrolling in
collision-prone Lake Ontario. Harsh winters might cause missile-carrying
TEL trucks to slide into ditches along an inadequately extensive highway
system.

Would CN and CPKC railway unions demand protocols to minimize the
exposure of their employees if Canada adopted a rail-mobile option,
especially because much of the rail network goes through inhabited
areas?

Deploying first-generation ballistic missile submarines into the deep
oceans would require a protective surface flotilla, exposing its
location.

saying the U.S. doesn't need Canada's stuff. We asked experts if he's
right,"
https://financialpost.com/news/economy/trump-us-doesnt-need-canada-stuff-right\]

Automobiles

[Trump made it clear during his meeting with Carney that the U.S. does
not want **Canadian-made vehicles**]{.underline}. "We want to make our
own cars, we don't really want cars from Canada," said Trump. "At a
certain point, it won't make economic sense for Canada to build those
cars."

[But North America's car industry is one of the most **integrated** in
the **world**]{.underline}, [originating with the **Auto
Pact**]{.underline} that was signed by the U.S. and Canada in 1965.

In 2024, Canada sent nearly 1.1 million vehicles to the U.S. and the
U.S. exported nearly 630,000 vehicles to Canada, according to the Bank
of Montreal.

Charles Bernard, lead economist at the Canadian Automobile Dealers
Association, [said it will take **billions** of **dollars** in
investment and **15 to 20 years**]{.underline} for the American auto
industry to replace the supply of vehicles it imports from Canada and
Mexico.

"[The tariff effects are certainly going to be negative for these
**companies**]{.underline}, [but **moving back** production would be
even **more costly**]{.underline}," said Bernard. "He (Trump) paints a
great image for the Americans about an industry that kind of made the
nation and bringing it back, but there are structural elements that
don't make it a possibility."

However, Bernard said Canada should be concerned about future
investments in the industry if the country is no longer seen as having
reliable tariff-free access to the U.S. market.

Auto parts

Like automobiles, [auto parts were supposed to be subject to **a 25 per
cent tariff**]{.underline}, but the White House confirmed on May 1 that
[Canadian parts made in compliance with the]{.underline} Canada--United
States--Mexico Agreement (**[CUSMA]{.underline}**) [would be
**exempted**]{.underline}.

Bernard said this decision was made following pressure from the U.S.
auto companies that warned the tariffs on auto parts would lead to
higher production costs and higher prices for vehicles.

"[The industrial tissue that links these **three countries**, you can't
necessarily **break them** and **recreate** it in **America right
away**]{.underline}," said Bernard. "Not only will it have a direct
impact on your ability to produce cars, but the cost would be extremely
high."

According to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce Business Lab, [Canada and
Mexico account for **58 per cent of** U.S. auto parts
imports]{.underline}. It is also estimated that [car parts cross the
Canada--U.S. border **six times** on average before **final
assembly**]{.underline}.

"You can't recreate that same optimization in four years," said Bernard.
"You would need to readjust your supply, there would be suppliers in
Canada that they wouldn't find in the U.S., because they don't have the
expertise."

Lumber

Trump has said the U.S. does not need Canadian lumber and, on March 1,
he signed an executive order to accelerate U.S. domestic production of
timber, lumber, paper and other forest products by deregulating logging
on federal lands.

The Canada--U.S. softwood lumber dispute goes back decades, with
combined countervailing and anti-dumping duties on Canadian lumber
currently sitting at just over 14 per cent. These levies are expected to
go up to 34 per cent this fall. Trump has threatened to impose
additional tariffs on top of the duties already in place but so far has
not done so.

[This is because the U.S. **relies heavily** on Canadian **lumber** and
**paper pulp products**]{.underline}. [Canada supplies **24 per cent**
of the U.S.'s **softwood lumber**]{.underline}, [which will be **hard**
to **replace**]{.underline}.

Ian Dunn, president and chief executive of the Ontario Forest Industries
Association, [said it would take **five to 10 years** for the U.S. to
replace the **Canadian market share**]{.underline}.

"They would have to build new capacity, and they would have to build new
mills," said Dunn. "A lot of mills in the U.S. south and pacific
northwest, have shut down or curtailed in the last 16 to 18 months."

[Canada is also a large source of **paper pulp**]{.underline}, a key
input for thousands of different products including paper towels and
toilet paper. [Canada produces **one-third** of the world's **northern
bleached softwood kraft** **pulp** and 75 per cent of **total capacity**
in **North America**]{.underline}.

"Big U.S. companies that supply (paper towel to) Walmart and Costco
really need that northern bleached softwood kraft," said Dunn.

Crude oil

[Canada is the biggest source of **crude oil** for]{.underline} the
U.S., [exporting four **million barrels** of the product per
day]{.underline}. About 90 per cent of Canada's oil exports go to the
U.S., mainly shipped through pipelines from Alberta to American
refineries and south to the U.S. gulf coast.

[Rory Johnston]{.underline}, [an oil market researcher and former
economist at the **Bank of Nova Scotia**]{.underline}, [said the
Canadian and American **oil trade**]{.underline} "[is arguably the two
most **integrated petroleum** systems on the **planet**]{.underline}."

"The whole flow --- so you have quality, you have geography, and you
have pipelines, which basically exclude a functional capability for the
United States to completely displace Canadian oil," said Johnston. "And
even if (they) could, it would take a decade or more and hundreds of
billions of dollars."

The costly process would include the U.S. having to retrofit refineries,
build new pipelines and reverse existing pipelines --- which Johnston
calls a "gigantic headache."

[He added that U.S. oil production has slowed for
**decades**]{.underline} and the recent drop in demand and prices due to
trade headwinds could lead to production going into reverse.

"At those prices, we're likely going to stall out on U.S. crude
production growth already, if not begin to contract outright," said
Johnston. "So, the opposite of drill baby drill."

Despite Trump's rhetoric, crude oil is currently exempt under CUSMA.

Steel and aluminum

Aside from autos, steel and aluminum are the only goods on which Trump
has applied 25 per cent sector-specific tariffs. Trump's issue with
Canadian steel and aluminum has carried over from his first term, when
he imposed Section 232 tariffs on Canadian metals in 2018.

"If we make it in the United States, we don't need it to be made in
Canada," said Trump in early February.

Despite the imposition of tariffs in 2018, [U.S. production capacity of
steel and aluminum did not **meaningfully increase**]{.underline},
according to the Royal Bank of Canada. Overall, RBC said Canada's
[exports of steel and aluminum to the U.S. have increased **by 35 per
cent**]{.underline} to US\$17.7 billion since 2018.

[Canadian steel supports important U.S. industries like
**defence**]{.underline}, **[manufacturing]{.underline}** [and
**shipbuilding**]{.underline}. [The North American steel market is also
**highly integrated**]{.underline}, which allows it to better compete in
the global market, which is subject to major overcapacity issues driven
by China.

Canadian aluminum and steel are also important for the U.S. auto
industry, which can source the two metals in a cost-effective way.
Bernard said nearly 60 per cent of aluminum used in U.S.-made cars is
from Quebec.

"That's a great example of the American president and his team
understanding that it's such a high amount of connected tissue, they
can't start tariffing every layer of it," said Bernard. "Because that
would mean layoffs right away for companies."

The Canadian aluminum sector can also produce more than its U.S.
counterpart, because Canada has more access to electricity. [The U.S.
simply does not have enough **electricity capacity** to power the number
of **aluminum smelters** needed to meet **domestic
demand**]{.underline}, according to the Aluminum Association of Canada.

Potash

[Potash, a key nutrient for plants and input in fertilizers, is
essential for **agriculture worldwide**]{.underline}.

[Canada leads the world in exports of **potash**]{.underline},
[accounting for nearly 41 per cent of all **global trade** of the
product]{.underline}, according to Natural Resources Canada. The only
other countries that rival Canada's output are Russia and Belarus at 18
per cent and 16.6 per cent respectively.

The U.S. is the major destination for Canadian potash, with Canada
supplying nearly 80 per cent of its needs.

"We're the largest producer of potash in the world," said Pierre
Gratton, president and chief executive of the Mining Association of
Canada. "So, it's no surprise they are heavily reliant on our potash."

In response to criticism over what a tariff on potash would mean for
American farmers, Trump lowered the tax to 10 per cent, before
eventually announcing CUSMA exemptions for Canadian goods, including
potash.

[U.S. production of potash accounts for just **one per cent** of
**demand**]{.underline}, according to the Fertilizer Institute. The
Russian and Belarusian potash industries also face challenges after the
U.S. imposed trade sanctions on the two countries after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Recently, Russia and Belarus have also
floated the possibility of export controls on potash, to secure domestic
supply and drive up market prices of the commodity. Any hopes of
replacing Canadian supply in the near-term remain impropable for the
U.S.

The [[new]{.mark} [Gordie Howe International Bridge]{.mark}]{.underline}
is less than two miles long, but it's been a long road to get there.
Plans are on [target for the [opening]{.mark} [this
fall]{.mark}]{.underline} of the six-lane span crossing the Detroit
River between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit. The bridge, named for a
Canadian hockey great who found fame on the ice for the Detroit Red
Wings, promises to deliver "unparalleled benefits for supply chains,
industry and commercial users," according to the Windsor-Detroit Bridge
Authority, the Canadian crown corporation overseeing construction of the
bridge. "It's far overdue," says Colin Bird, consul general of Canada in
Detroit. "We've been talking about this for the better part of two
decades, but [we're **[five steps away]{.mark}** from the finish
line]{.underline}." It will be the longest cable-stayed bridge in North
America upon its completion, and a feather in the cap of business
boosters on both shores. "[So many of us on this side of the border ---
either us personally or the organizations we represent --- have fought
to get the Gordie Howe Bridge]{.underline}," says Sandy Baruah,
president of the Detroit Regional Chamber. But while it was conceived as
a [[means]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[strengthening]{.mark} the
[bond]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}** [and
**Canada**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Gordie Howe Bridge is arriving at
an uncharacteristically acrimonious moment in American-Canadian
relations. Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has
lobbed a series of rhetorical and policy attacks on the US's northern
neighbor, announcing punishing tariffs on Canadian goods and threatening
annexation to make it the 51st state. In response, Canadian exports to
the US have fallen off sharply. So has travel to US destinations. The
trade war has clouded the immediate economic prospects for the C\$6.4
billion (\$4.7 billion) structure, which is being built entirely with
Canadian funding and is designed to shore up a vulnerable link in the
supply chain for the Great Lakes region --- a hub for auto manufacturing
on both sides of the border. "[We're finally seeing this needed
reinvestment, which I think is telling a story that we're open for
**business** again]{.underline}." Bird says. "But this progress can be
completely disrupted by a tariff policy that doesn't take into account
the Midwest realities." Breaking a Bottleneck For almost a century,
carmakers and other manufacturers have been obliged to ship their goods
between Windsor and Detroit on the Ambassador Bridge, which has more
crossings annually than the next two busiest cross-border bridges
combined --- the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, New York, and the Blue Water
Bridge in Port Huron, Michigan. (There is also a tunnel between Detroit
and Windsor, publicly owned and privately operated, but that's more for
commuter traffic than commercial traffic.) [[Roughly]{.mark} a
**[quarter]{.mark} [of]{.mark} all [trade]{.mark}** between the US and
Canada [rolls across]{.mark} the aging [four-lane structure]{.mark},
worth [more than **\$100 billion**]{.mark} annually.]{.underline} New
US--Canada Border Crossing The Gordie Howe International Bridge is set
to open later in 2025 [With a name selected to evoke the **peaceable**
relationship between the United States and Canada]{.underline}, the
Ambassador Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world when it
opened in 1929 (the George Washington Bridge in New York City supplanted
it two years later). And it was privately constructed. Neither Detroit
nor Windsor had an appetite for building a new bridge, but Detroit's
auto industry saw the demand and funded the span privately. The mayor of
Detroit at the time, John Smith, tried to block the project, seeing the
potential danger of a privately owned border crossing; a referendum in
favor of the bridge passed by an 8-1 margin in a 1927 special election.
"I bow to the will of the people," Smith said. "They want a bridge and
they must have a bridge." But the Ambassador had no sooner opened than
the Great Depression hit. Debt-leveraged to the hilt, the company that
owned it restructured in 1939 and became publicly traded. In 1979, local
trucking magnate Manuel "Matty" Moroun swept in and became majority
owner. For decades afterward, Moroun --- a controversial and
publicity-shy billionaire who died in 2020 --- maintained an iron grip
over the crossing, fighting US and Canadian efforts to construct a
publicly owned rival. Demands for a second bridge became louder
following the terrorist attacks in the US on September 11, 2001, as
tighter security led to longer delays. More recently, the need for
another crossing was vividly demonstrated in 2022, when trucker protests
against the Covid-19 vaccine snarled traffic for miles in Windsor.
"There is a lack of redundancy in the system, which has been a challenge
for the growth of the region," Bird says. ["The [bridge]{.mark} is a
potential [concern as]{.mark} a **[chokepoint]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
Moroun pitched "twinning" the Ambassador Bridge --- building a new
six-lane span next to the current bridge, which he would also control.
In the teeth of the Great Recession, the Michigan legislature tried to
pass a bill for a 50-50 split on costs of its own new bridge.
Eventually, Canada agreed to pay for the construction in full ---
including the toll and inspection facilities on the US side. Moroun
sought to block the project, mounting a campaign against the state
referendum to approve construction and buying an ad on Fox News in 2018
urging President Trump to scuttle the project. Trump did not take up the
cause, and in October of that year, construction on the Gordie
officially started. (The Moroun-owned Detroit International Bridge
Company, which still operates the Ambassador Bridge, did not respond to
requests for comment.) Located about three miles south of the
Ambassador, the Gordie Howe Bridge stands to be a major advance on its
older counterpart. The sleek cable-stayed structure, designed by the
global architecture giant AECOM, boasts 722-foot-tall towers that are
supposed to "reflect the curvature of a hockey stick in a slap shot."
Most importantly, it will be a lot easier to reach by highway. Trucks
crossing into Detroit now need to traverse neighborhoods in Windsor ---
there are eight stoplights from Ontario's busiest highway, the 401, to
the Ambassador Bridge, Bird says. The Gordie Howe Bridge will be a
direct link from US Interstate 75 with the 401. "Freeway-to-freeway
connection is something this area has long needed," Bird says. That
connectivity will be a boon for the automakers who stand to be the
span's biggest power users. Bird estimated that vehicles assembled in
Canada or the Great Lakes region of the United States typically cross
the Detroit River six or seven times. (Indeed, one of the reasons the
Ambassador Bridge became such an important crossing was the Automotive
Products Trade Act of 1965 that removed duties on most auto components
that passed between the two countries.) "When you're doing just-in-time
processing, you can't have the uncertainty of downtown Windsor and
downtown Detroit traffic," Baruah says. Tourists Wanted At the moment,
bridge traffic is less of an issue: Car and truck crossings on the
Ambassador Bridge have plunged dramatically since January, as Canadians
forgo discretionary trips to the US and automakers pull back on exports.
It's a trend that's expected to continue through the summer travel
season. Though Canadian tourism to the US is currently on ice, there's
hope that the Gordie Howe Bridge will eventually draw crowds, and even
become an attraction in and of itself. (It might not hurt that the
bridge's pugnacious namesake also inspired the rallying cry of Canadian
resistance to Trump's tariff threats: "elbows up!") Should daytrippers
arrive, they'll find that, in addition to six lanes for auto and truck
travel, the [span includes a toll-free multiuse path nearly 12 feet wide
for walkers and cyclists]{.underline}. The path will lead to extensive
trail networks on both sides of the border. In Windsor, it will link to
the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail, which itself connects to the
Trans-Canada Trail. On the American side, it connects to the network of
parks and trails on Detroit's riverfront, about 5.5 miles from the
bridge to Belle Isle, a popular Michigan tourist destination. And
downtown Detroit is just about halfway between the Gordie Howe Bridge
and the Belle Isle bridge. Gordon Orr, the chief executive officer of
Tourism Windsor Essex Pelee Island, notes that the bike path wasn't
originally included in plans for the bridge. Rather, Orr said it was
added after Canadian stakeholder meetings with the bridge authority
revealed a desire for it. "I think a lot of people are looking for
unique experiences, and some of them do cross bridges as kind of a
bucket list item," he says. "There will be memories and moments there. I
think there will be wedding proposals on it." Detroit's Baruah said the
uncertainty swirling around the tariff situation makes any predictions
on immediate local impact difficult. "We'll need at least a year of data
and a stable policy environment," he says. [But the [bridge]{.mark} has
been [needed]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a [long]{.mark} [time]{.mark}, he
notes, and it should be [viewed as]{.mark} a **[long-term
solution]{.mark}**. "You're playing a long game]{.underline}," he says.
"[We are exceptionally **[unconcerned]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the
[**political moment** of the day]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [how]{.mark}
[it]{.mark} might [impact]{.mark} the [utility]{.mark} of the
bridge.]{.underline} The Gordie Howe Bridge is a 100-year investment,
not a four-year investment." Bird is equally confident that the value of
the completed span will stretch well beyond the current political rift
between the two countries. ["It [will]{.mark} [attract **further
investment**]{.mark}," Bird says of the bridge. "As long as we get the
rest of the policy picture right."]{.underline}

The [frenzied [tariff]{.mark} [announcements]{.mark} of recent weeks
risk **[obscur]{.mark}ing** a simple [fact]{.mark}: **[most
Cana]{.mark}dian [exports]{.mark}** [face **no tariffs**]{.mark} when
entering the United States]{.underline}. Goods that are compliant with
the rules of origin of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement have
been exempted from tariffs imposed in February based on White House
claims about fentanyl coming from Canada, and what the U.S. calls
"reciprocal" tariffs, which are poised to come into effect on Aug. 1.
[[No such]{.mark} [exemption]{.mark} has been [**granted** to other
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. South Korea, for example, which
renegotiated its own free-trade agreement with the United States during
the first Trump administration, now faces a steep 25-per-cent tariff.
German and Japanese auto part manufacturers must pay a 25-per-cent
tariff when exporting to the U.S. compared with tariff-free access for
Canadian USMCA-compliant auto parts. Even Britain, which struck a trade
deal with the U.S. in June, only secured limited sectoral duty
exemptions, and is subject to a 10-per-cent tariff for all other
exports. [[Canada]{.mark} prepared to [hold out for **best**]{.mark}
**[deal]{.mark}** in U.S. trade talks, Carney says Algoma Steel seeks up
to \$600-million from Ottawa in emergency trade war relief In short,
compared with the rest of the world, Canada and Mexico [enjoy
**unrivalled access**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [American consumer
market]{.mark}.]{.underline} What then is Prime Minister Mark Carney
aiming for in current trade talks with the U.S.? And what is he thinking
when he follows U.S. sectoral tariffs with trade walls of his own? Going
back to the days of fully liberalized trade in North America seems out
of the question while the self-styled "tariff man" occupies the White
House. Nor can Mr. Carney expect to significantly reduce tariff-induced
business uncertainty, which is stifling new investment. [Mr. Trump
concludes deals with fingers crossed behind his back. He has proven
ready to move **away** even from **legally binding arrangements** he
previously agreed to.]{.underline} Perhaps Mr. Trump's untrustworthiness
is precisely what is on Mr. Carney's mind as he pursues trade talks: We
still have mostly tariff-free trade today. But what about tomorrow if
Mr. Trump rips up USMCA? Yet the argument for talks is also the argument
against them: In Mr. Trump's world, uncertainty is a feature, not a bug,
and any promise to his trading partners is only a short-lived reprieve.
Given that there is little to gain in trade talks in terms of
broad-based tariffs, Mr. Carney's energy in such talks is likely
directed at the sectors hit by sectoral U.S. tariffs, namely steel,
aluminum, copper and lumber. But any gains to be had are hard-won and
only marginal in scope. That is because these tariffs have been imposed
on national-security grounds. The question under the applicable U.S.
statute is not whether Canadian steel or lumber threatens U.S. national
security, but whether U.S. domestic production capacity is sufficient to
meet projected national defence requirements. If the U.S. goal is to
achieve self-sufficiency for defence purposes in critical industries,
there is little Canada can offer. That has not discouraged Canada from
trying. [Both the [withdrawal]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [digital services
tax]{.mark} in the face of **U.S. criticism** [and]{.mark} the recent
[imposition]{.mark} [of]{.mark} trade [restrictions]{.mark} on steel
imports [into Canada]{.mark} must be [seen as **gestures of
goodwill**]{.mark}]{.underline} toward Mr. Trump. Sooner or later,
though, Canada will have to stop giving without receiving and shift
gears. First, [Canada should recognize that the status quo is likely the
**best trade deal** it can get.]{.underline} Let's ride that wave as far
as it carries us. A review of USMCA is looming down the road where Mr.
Trump will inevitably demand new concessions while offering at best only
the more restricted market access Canada currently enjoys. [While the
USMCA review is more threat than opportunity, **[time]{.mark}** is [on
Canada's side]{.mark}.]{.underline} With any luck, markets may have
soured, [inflation is up and midterms around the corner by the time
USMCA renegotiations enter their final stretch, which should give
Canadian negotiators additional leverage.]{.underline} Second, [[most
products]{.mark} [affected]{.mark} by [tariffs are
**commodities**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} can be [trade]{.mark}d [on
**global markets**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While not as convenient as
shipping to the U.S., Canadian aluminum, steel, copper and lumber can be
sold to Europe and Asia. [A [key policy goal]{.mark} must thus be to
[**cushion the blow**]{.mark} for the industries affected by Mr. Trump's
tariffs, but [without]{.mark} [upsetting]{.mark} future
[customers]{.mark} outside the United States]{.underline}. Buy-Canadian
procurement and temporary import restrictions to prevent imports
diverted away from the U.S. to flood the Canadian market are sensible in
principle. In practice, however, Canada's latest steel trade
restrictions have been implemented in a way that is unnecessarily
discriminatory and illegal under global trade rules. It will likely
upset those very markets that Canada looks to as alternatives to the
U.S. Lest Canada wants to see barriers erected against its own wares by

World,"
https://www.wsj.com/opinion/trump-seeks-to-remake-the-world-foreign-policy-4e41c836\]

Five months into the most consequential foreign-policy presidency since
Richard Nixon left the White House, [Donald Trump's approach to the
world is taking on a **definitive shape**]{.underline}.

First and foremost, [restraint isn't part of Mr. Trump's **political
method**]{.underline}. [He seeks to accumulate as much **executive
power** as possible at home; he wants the same thing
**internationally**]{.underline}. Far from limiting America's world
role, [Mr. Trump intends to place the country at the **center** of
**international affairs**]{.underline}. What Alice Longworth said of her
father, Theodore Roosevelt, is true of Mr. Trump, at least as far as his
approach to international and domestic politics. He wants to be the
corpse at every funeral, the bride at every wedding, and the baby at
every christening.

That doesn't mean he is a neoconservative or a liberal internationalist.
The 47th president loathes crusades for democracy, despises
multinational institutions, and treats international courts with the
contempt he believes they deserve. While he genuinely hates war, [Mr.
Trump believes in pressing America's **economic**, **technological** and
**military advantages** as far as he can in pursuit of an expansive
vision of the **national interest**]{.underline}.

[His presidency is about the concentration of power for **maximalist
goals**]{.underline}. [His **trade policy**]{.underline}, whatever
economists may say about it, [has concentrated **unprecedented power**
in his hands at home and **abroad**]{.underline}. At home, he can affect
the profitability of almost every company in the U.S. by setting
tariffs.

Mr. Trump's opponents criticize him for blowing up the multilateral
trading system. In their view, that system better safeguarded American
economic interests than a chaotic and fluid system resting more on
bilateral and political agreements. We shall see whether Mr. Trump's
gamble that he can get better deals bilaterally than the U.S. got
through the multilateral system pays off. But what isn't in doubt is
that his goal is to maximize rather than to restrain American economic
power.

[Mr. Trump's Europe policy shows every quality **except
restraint**]{.underline}. From laying claim to Greenland and repeatedly
interfering in European elections to ripping up the trade relationship
and threatening to walk away from the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, [everything this administration has done has been intended
to **increase American power** in Brussels and beyond]{.underline}. NATO
Secretary General Mark Rutte has been condemned for comparing Mr. Trump
to "daddy," who sometimes has to get tough. But America's president is
Europe's daddy now---and he has gotten the Old World to jump through
more hoops than any of his predecessors in the past 50 years.

[In the **Middle East**]{.underline}, [Mr. Trump has similarly
**flouted** the **restrainers' advice** and engaged in a free-wheeling
and far-reaching policy aimed at **reasserting American
hegemony**]{.underline} while avoiding long-term military engagements.
[From **bombing Iran** and threatening the life of its **supreme
leader**]{.underline} to proposing the mass removal of Palestinians from
Gaza and threatening Israel with a dramatic suspension of aid, [the
president has been a **hyper-activist** in the region]{.underline}.

That Secretary of State Marco Rubio was celebrating the signing of a
peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda last week
highlights the immense ambition that drives Trumpian foreign policy. The
world is a stage, and Mr. Trump intends to stand in its limelight.

[The **Congo-Rwanda agreement**]{.underline}, which may or may not
succeed on the ground, illustrates a hallmark of Trumpian diplomacy: [an
unconventional and **amplified reliance** on American economic power to
achieve **international goals**]{.underline}. [Whether it is the
**mining deal** with **Ukraine**, the **critical** **minerals**
agreement in central **Africa**]{.underline}, or the spate of
artificial-intelligence deals with the Gulf countries, [President Trump
and his diplomats seek to **unite American security** and **economic
interests**]{.underline}.

[Landing **disabling blows** against **Iran**]{.underline}, [the weakest
of the **major revisionist powers**]{.underline}, [both strengthens the
American **global position** and **telegraphs warnings** to **Moscow**
and **Beijing**]{.underline}. So does forcing Europe to rearm. It
remains to be seen whether and how Mr. Trump will deploy his preferred
elements of American power to assert his primacy over Vladimir Putin and
Xi Jinping.

[China and Russia are the two great powers that **most want** America's
might and its ambitious **president restrained**]{.underline}. [Both
these revisionist powers see how Mr. Trump has **asserted American
dominance** in Europe and **strengthened** the U.S. role in the **Middle
East.**]{.underline} China and Russia perceive [Trumpian **ambition** as
a **threat** and will look to derail **any project** that would
**diminish** their **global** **clout**]{.underline}.

The outcomes of this competition are impossible to predict, but one
thing is clear. [Donald Trump is no **shrinking violet**]{.underline},
and as long as he sits in the Oval Office, [the U.S. is unlikely to
**retreat** from the **world**]{.underline}.

### Pursuit Inevitable\-\--1AR

#### 'Restrainers' are [losing influence]{.underline}.

**Thiessen '25** \[Marc; July 24; Bachelor of Arts degree from Vassar
College, graduate studies at the Naval War College; Washington Post, "An
old GOP group has a new name. It still can't 'restrain' Trump.,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/07/24/trump-restrainer-isolationist-foreign-policy/\]

[The neo-isolationist right does not like being called
**isolationist**]{.underline}, a term they know is sullied in the
American psyche by its association with the 1940s isolationists who
fought to keep the United States out of World War II. So, they are
coming up with new euphemisms to describe their noninterventionist
approach to the world.

They now want to be called "**[restrainers]{.underline}**." The
restrainers don't want to retreat from the world, they claim; [they
simply want to restrain the use of force, the growth of U.S. military
spending and U.S. **security commitments** abroad]{.underline}.

But their moniker begs a question: [Who, exactly, are the restrainers
seeking to **restrain**]{.underline}?

[Answer: **Donald Trump**]{.underline}. Unfortunately for them, six
months into his second presidency, Trump is proving to be quite
unrestrainable.

[The restrainers did not want Trump to bomb the **Houthis** in
**Yemen**]{.underline}, [arguing the **terrorist attacks** on
**ships**]{.underline} and [tankers crossing the **Suez
Canal**]{.underline}, [the **Red Sea** and the **Gulf of
Aden**]{.underline} were primarily a European problem. [They would have
effectively continued the **feckless policies** of President **Joe
Biden**]{.underline}, [who allowed these terrorist proxies of
**Iran**]{.underline} [to fire with virtual impunity more than 140 times
at **merchant vessels**]{.underline} and 174 times at U.S. warships.

Trump was having none of it. "The Houthi attack on American vessels will
not be tolerated," he declared on Truth Social. He warned the Houthis,
"YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY
DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN
BEFORE!" And he warned Iran that "Support for the Houthi terrorists must
end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President,
who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or
Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold
you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"

[When the Houthis failed to **comply**]{.underline}, [Trump launched a
51-day **military campaign**]{.underline}, during which U.S. forces
struck more than 1,000 Houthi targets, [killed hundreds **Houthi
fighters**]{.underline} and leaders, [and destroyed their
**headquarters**]{.underline}, [weapons depots and missiles poised to be
**launched**]{.underline} --- [until the fighting ended with a
**ceasefire agreement** brokered by Oman]{.underline}.

Not very restrained!

[The restrainers also did not want Trump to bomb **Iran's nuclear
program**]{.underline}, [warning Trump not to listen to the]{.underline}
"**[neocons]{.underline}**" and "warmongers" (as Director of National
Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard put it). [Trump ignored their warnings and
gave Iran a **deadline**]{.underline} to peacefully give up its nuclear
weapons program.

When it failed to do so, he launched Operation Midnight Hammer,
deploying a squadron of B-2 bombers that "obliterated" Iran's nuclear
sites. He warned Iran he would subject its Supreme Leader to "A VERY
UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH" if they killed a single American in
retaliation. And, to the horror of the neo-isolationists, he declared on
Truth Social soon after the attack: "It's not politically correct to use
the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable
to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???
MIGA!!!" Iran backed down. With his decisive action, Trump delivered a
devastating setback to Iran's nuclear ambitions and brought an end to
the Iran-Israel war after just 12 days of fighting.

[The restrainers also did not want Trump to arm
**Ukraine**]{.underline}. Indeed, [restrainers inside the Pentagon
**suspended** U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine **without Trump's
knowledge**]{.underline}. They were not paying attention to Trump's
repeated warnings that if Russian leader Vladimir Putin did not agree to
his efforts to broker peace, he would give Ukraine more weapons than it
has ever received from the U.S. and impose crippling secondary tariffs
on all oil coming out of Russia. [Now that Putin has rejected Trump's
peace efforts, Trump is **delivering** on those
**promises**]{.underline} --- [sending Ukraine advanced **U.S.-made
weaponry**]{.underline} (purchased for Kyiv by European allies),
including rockets, artillery and Patriot air defense systems, and giving
Putin 50 days to come to the peace table or see his economy crushed.

[None of this should come as a **surprise**]{.underline}. [Trump's
second term actions are consistent with his **first term
record**]{.underline}, [when he drove the Islamic State from its
**caliphate**]{.underline}, [bombed **Syria**]{.underline} (twice) for
using chemical weapons on its people, [gave the green light for the U.S.
military to take out **hundreds** of **Wagner Group mercenaries** in
eastern Syria]{.underline}, launched a cyberattack on Russia targeting
St. Petersburg's Internet Research Agency, armed Ukraine with Javelin
anti-tank missiles and killed then-leader of Iran's Quds Force Qasem
Soleimani. [Trump is not, and **never was**, an
**isolationist**]{.underline}.

[Neither are his **supporters**]{.underline}. A [CBS News poll finds
that **94 percent** of self-identified **MAGA Republicans** support
Trump's strikes on Iran's **nuclear facilities**]{.underline}. [And **65
percent** of Trump voters say they **agree** with his decision to
increase the **sale** of **weapons** to Ukraine]{.underline}, while just
22 percent are opposed, according to a new Echelon Insights poll.

This should not be a surprise either. Polling by the Ronald Reagan
Institute has consistently shown that [MAGA Republicans are more
**hawkish** and **supportive** **of U.S. leadership**]{.underline} on
the world stage than establishment Republicans: [73 percent of MAGA
Republicans want the **U.S**. to be]{.underline} "[more **engaged** and
take the lead]{.underline}" on foreign policy; [74 percent say
that]{.underline} "[U.S. involvement with international affairs is
**mostly beneficial** for the **U.S.";**]{.underline} 84 percent say
"the U.S. has a moral obligation to stand up for human rights and
democracy whenever possible in international affairs"; 71 percent
support "the U.S. responding with military force if a NATO ally in
Europe was attacked"; and 73 percent would support "taking military
action to defend Taiwan" if China were to attack or blockade the island.

In other words, [the]{.underline} "**[restrainers]{.underline}**" [are
out of step with both **Trump** and his **supporters**]{.underline}.
[They are a **tiny minority** in the GOP]{.underline}, [which has tried
to **hijack** the **MAGA**]{.underline} movement to advance their
neo-isolationist agenda --- and are now finding just how isolated they
really are. Indeed, [the only thing as satisfying as watching Trump
exercise bold **American leadership** on the world stage over the past
**six** **months**]{.underline} [has been watching the isolationists
realize that **Trump** is **not one of them**]{.underline}.\\

#### Trump pursues [hard domination]{.underline}.

**Kagarlitsky '25** \[Boris; July 24; PhD, a historian and director of
the Institute for Globalization and Social Movements; Counterpunch,
"From US Hegemony to a 'War of All Against All',"
https://www.counterpunch.org/2025/07/24/from-us-hegemony-to-a-war-of-all-against-all/\]

[Trump is]{.underline} dismantling US hegemony --- not to replace it
with a fairer world order, but [to impose **US dominance** by
**force**]{.underline}

And it is not just that Trump is simultaneously trying to strengthen the
US' trade position while destabilising its currency. Behind this lies an
even deeper issue. Trump is in effect dismantling the system of US
hegemony, but not in order to replace it with a more equitable and
balanced world order. On the contrary, [his goal is to replace it with a
system of **US domination** through force: compelling other countries
not just to trade resources and goods, but to hand them over to the most
**powerful predator**]{.underline}.

The alternative to US hegemony is a 'war of all against all'

The system of hegemony entails not only significant benefits for the US,
but also numerous obligations and burdens placed on the US state and
society. This is precisely the burden Trump seeks to shed in order to
"Make America Great Again." Unfortunately, [in today's **global
conditions**, the alternative to hegemony is not a fairer world order
but **chaos**]{.underline}, what is often for some reason called a
"multipolar world" in Russia, [but is in fact a]{.underline} "[war of
**all** against **all**]{.underline}". In a world of chaos, the larger
predators simply devour the weaker ones --- and even they are not immune
from being devoured or at least seriously bitten. It [is clear that
**economic chaos** inevitably leads to **war**]{.underline}. [And these
would not be the so-called]{.underline} "**[managed]{.underline}**"
**[conflicts]{.underline}** fantasised about by conspiracy theorists.

In reality, the collapse of the global economy is not part of Trump's
plan. That is why his new administration in Washington will need to
construct at least some system of alliances. But that effort is not
going too well either.

Trump's geopolitics

If we were to briefly summarise the transformation brought about in the
global system by Trump's victory, it would be this: [**t**he **U**nited
**S**tates, under **Trump**]{.underline}, has effectively abandoned its
role as global hegemon, not to [establish]{.underline} a more democratic
and rule-based order, but to replace hegemony with direct, [**hard**
**domination**]{.underline}.

[From Trump's perspective, the **burden** the US bears to maintain
**balance** and **functionality** in the world-system is]{.underline}
"**[unfair]{.underline}**." As a result, a unified, rules-based
international order is being replaced by a patchwork of bilateral deals,
each negotiated ad hoc, without regard for the interests of other
parties, and based purely on the balance of power at the given moment.
This approach flows logically from Trump's worldview but, of course, the
issue goes far beyond the personality of the 47th president of the
United States.

The crisis of US hegemony has been unfolding for a long time,
corresponding to the decline of the US share in the global economy. At
the same time, the [US elite's **inclination** toward **coercive**
**solutions** has **steadily grown**]{.underline}. And yet now a
decisive turning point has arrived. Acknowledging the crisis of
hegemony, Trump [does not attempt to repair or reform the system.
Instead, he proposes to discard the global **social contract**
**entirely**]{.underline} and **[return]{.underline}**, at a new level,
[to a]{.underline} "[war of all against]{.underline}
**[all]{.underline}**", [in which the **US**]{.underline}, as [the
**largest predator**]{.underline}, [can extract **unilateral
gains**]{.underline}.

#### They'll pursue hegemony in the Arctic.

[**US** steps up arctic **military activities** to consolidate
**regional hegemony**]{.underline}

During his first term in office, Donald [**Trump** openly stated that
the **Arctic** region would become a **key battleground** in the
future]{.underline}. The [Report on the Arctic Strategy of the US issued
by the **Pentagon** explicitly designates the Arctic as \"a **potential
corridor** for strategic competition]{.underline}.\" Under this
strategic guidance, the US [**Coast Guard**, **Air Force** and **Space
Force**, **Navy**, and **Army** have successively released their own
**Arctic strategies**]{.underline}. After [Donald **Trump** was
re-elected as president, he declared his intention to \"**buy\"
Greenland**]{.underline}, [suggested making **Canada** the 51st US
state]{.underline}, and again withdrew from the Paris Agreement aimed at
addressing climate change. [These actions by the US in the Arctic
reflect its ambition to **consolidate** its **hegemonic position** in
the **region**]{.underline}.

#### Hegemony [sustainable]{.underline} and pursuit is [inevitable]{.underline}. No [Trump]{.underline} warrant!

The [**death** of the **U**nited **S**tates' **unipolar** moment is
**exaggerated**]{.underline}. Foreign policy experts claiming the United
States is on the decline and international relations are headed to
multipolarity are less than accurate. Pundits insist that China's
economic and military rise will allow the country to eclipse the United
States and lead to the creation of new international institutions led by
Beijing.

The [results of the American **air strikes** on **Iran**'s nuclear
facilities serves as]{.underline} a harsh [reminder]{.underline} to
those who believe multipolarity is the future of the world order.
[American military power is still **unmatched**]{.underline}.

[Operation Midnight Hammer demonstrated the remarkable **military
power** of the United States and President Donald **Trump's
willingness** to use it when an **adversary** crosses American red
lines]{.underline}. The [surgical strikes of American stealth aircraft
and cruise missiles]{.underline} expertly [showcased]{.underline} the
awesome [power of the American military]{.underline}.

The strikes were more than a display of power. They left no doubt that
[President Trump is **laser focused** and committed to protecting
**American** vital **interests**]{.underline}. The strikes were also a
[**message** to allies and foes alike that the United States will stand
by its **allies** when facing an exis**tential threat**]{.underline},
especially when that ally demonstrates a willingness to defend itself.

Even though the Trump administration used limited strikes against the
nuclear facilities, the underlying message is clear. Red lines,
deadlines, and ally support are back. Through the masterful use of
deception, stealth, and precision, the American strike was unseen.
Tehran's subsequent retaliatory strikes were nothing more than
preplanned and face-saving missile launches to placate domestic
audiences.

The follow-on ceasefire agreement stands to put an end to Iran's
regional and nuclear ambitions and forces Iran and Israel to tamp down
their hostilities to allow for a negotiated settlement. Interestingly,
[Iran's **allies** effectively **abandoned** Tehran as the Ayatollah and
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) looked **feckless** and
**weak** compared to the combined strength of Israel and the
US]{.underline}.

[**China**, **Russia**, and Iran's Middle East **proxies** were
**nowhere to be found**]{.underline}. The so-[called "**Axis of
Resistance**" is in **tatters** as the result of Israeli and American
action]{.underline}. Whether or not Iran takes the opportunity to
deescalate and seek a peaceful resolution remains to be seen.
Regardless, Operation Midnight Hammer should be seen as a return to
deterrence with Tehran and in the capitals of America's adversaries
worldwide.

Bolstering Alliances

On the heels of successful air strikes, President Trump received another
geostrategic win as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO)
member states agreed to spend 5 percent of gross domestic product on
defense spending. NATO members, with the goading of President Trump,
realized that Russian aggression necessitated greater commitment to
defense.

[Trump's goal for **increased defense spending** is not to weaken NATO
but to strengthen it]{.underline}. By requiring all members to carry a
proportional share of collective defense, American leadership will only
[**strengthen** a once great **alliance**]{.underline}. Russia must
reconsider its desire to once again expand its sphere of influence and
control by force.

#### Pursuit's inevitable.

ambitions,"

accessed: 7.24.25\]

[Recently]{.underline}, the [**Pentagon** announced the **Fiscal Year**
2026 Defense Budget, totaling around **one trillion
dollars**]{.underline}. Analysts point out that this new defense budget
exposes the [dangerous trend of the US clinging to **militarism** and
accelerating **preparations** for war]{.underline}, which deserves high
vigilance from the international community.

New Record in Defense Budget

For a long time, the [US has regarded **military hegemony** as a **key
pillar** of its global **dominance**, continuously increasing defense
spending year after year]{.underline}. In May this year, the US
Department of Defense, for the first time, submitted its FY2026 defense
budget request in the form of \"one budget, two bills.\" The request
submitted to the House of Representatives and the Senate amounts to
\$848.3 billion. In addition, the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\"
includes \$157 billion defense funding, with \$113.3 billion planned for
FY2026. This means the actual total defense budget request for the
Department of Defense stands at \$961.6 billion for FY2026. Factoring in
defense-related funding requested by other departments, the overall US
defense budget will exceed \$1.01 trillion.

[Compared with previous years, the FY2026 Defense Budget has two notable
features]{.underline}. First, it [marks a **significant** year-on-year
**increase**]{.underline}. The requested budget is about \$110 billion
higher than the previous fiscal year, an increase of more than 13%. The
other is that [defense spending as a share of the federal discretionary
budget has **risen sharply**]{.underline}. According to statistics, from
FY2024 to FY2026, the share of the U.S. defense budget in the federal
discretionary budget has risen from 47% to 57%, exposing the Trump
administration\'s strategic choice of prioritizing \"security over
people\'s livelihoods.\"

[**Pursuing** Overwhelming **Superiority**]{.underline}

The US is [dramatically boosting its **nuclear budget** to accelerate
the modernization of its nuclear **triad**]{.underline}. For FY2026, the
Pentagon requests \$60 billion for nuclear forces, up 22% year-on-year.
This funding will mainly support the research and procurement of new
delivery platforms and strike munitions, including Columbia-class
ballistic missile submarines, B-21 strategic bombers, LGM-35 Sentinel
intercontinental ballistic missiles, and sea-launched nuclear cruise
missiles. [The goal is to build a next-generation nuclear triad by 2040
to strengthen the US **strategic deterrent**]{.underline}.

The [budget also aims to maintain a high level of **combat readiness**
to ensure that the US troops are prepared to fight at any
time]{.underline}. The [Pentagon plans to spend \$160 billion on force
readiness and training in FY2026, an increase of 22%, to further enhance
**combat capability.**]{.underline} Analysts point out that this funding
will not only support hundreds of joint exercises and large-scale
theater-level drills but also help [expand production capacity for
critical munitions and weapon systems, laying the **groundwork** for a
**d**efense **i**ndustrial **b**ase geared toward **major power
conflict**]{.underline}.

#### He still wants it.

**Blakeley '25** \[Grace; English economics and politics commentator,
columnist, journalist and author; Transform Europe, "What Is Trump
Planning to Do to Us in These Turbulent Times?",
https://transform-network.net/blog/analysis/what-is-trump-planning-to-do-to-us-in-these-turbulent-times/;
accessed: 7.24.25\]

[Under **Trump**, the role of the **US military** is unlikely to
**change**]{.underline} -- [though its **focus** may shift even further
towards attempting to **resist** the **rise** of China]{.underline}. But
the US' role as guardian of the architecture of the global economy may
come under threat.

The US is able to run dual current account deficits as well as fiscal
deficits because everyone wants to hold dollars. Why does everyone want
to hold dollars? Because they're the global reserve currency. But, for
the dollar to play the role of the world's reserve currency, there has
to be a surplus of dollars in the world economy, which means the US has
to run a current account deficit. So, if Trump wants to reduce the US'
current account deficit, he'll have to accept that he will also be
undermining the dollar's role as the global reserve currency.

That's why so many people found Trump's comments on his social media
site Truth Social so bizarre. He wrote: "The idea that the BRICS
Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and
watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these countries that they
will neither create a new Brics currency nor back any other currency to
replace the mighty US dollar or they will face 100% tariffs and should
expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy."

What's funny about this statement is that imposing tariffs on these
countries would make it easier, and more necessary, for them to shift
away from the dollar. If you want the dollar as the world's reserve
currency, you have to maintain a current account deficit.

To be clear, [neither of these **aspects** of US **hegemony** is likely
to **change** under Trump]{.underline}. No matter how hard he tries,
[Trump isn't going to **eliminate** the trade deficit without
**decimating** US citizens' **demand** for imports]{.underline} --
[which would entail a huge amount of **economic pain**]{.underline}. And
[even if he did manage to substantially reduce the deficit]{.underline},
a [transition]{.underline} away from the dollar as the world's reserve
currency [would require another currency to **step in** -- and it's not
obvious which **currency** that would be at this point in
time]{.underline}.

### Pursuit Inevitable\-\--Ext\-\--Populism

#### Populism [reinforces]{.underline} support for [assertive]{.underline} foreign policy. 

**Ross '25** \[Dennis; March 4; Former special assistant to President
Barack Obama counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy
and also teaches at Georgetown University; "Here's Why the U.S. is No
Longer the World's Only Superpower,"
https://time.com/7263996/the-u-s-no-longer-the-worlds-only-superpower/\]

[The rise of populist and **nationalists policies**]{.underline},
embodied by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance [are
raising basic questions about **the U.S**. **role** in the
**world**]{.underline}. In 2006, I was writing about an America that was
debating our role in Iraq but still believed in U.S. leadership
internationally. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan raised basic questions
about the cost of our role in the world and eroded the consensus that
America must lead.

In such an environment, where costs are increasingly seen as decisive,
the U.S. may not continue to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's
ongoing aggression. Indeed, it may no longer be axiomatic that the U.S.
will support the basic norm that aggression is wrong and bigger states
don't have the right to dictate to their smaller neighbors. If we don't
want that to be the case and we are to play a sustainable role
internationally, we need to act in a way that is consistent with
American traditions and be far more effective in our statecraft.

[The former is necessary to strike a chord with the **American
public**]{.underline}. The latter is necessary to marry our objectives
with our means, the essence of good statecraft, especially because only
in this way are our policies going to succeed. It has been the mismatch
of objectives and means that has produced failures and undermined the
consensus. And in a world of challengers on the outside and questioning
on the inside, we no longer have the luxury of practicing statecraft
badly.

I explore our traditions in foreign policy in the book because they
create a context in which presidents make choices and contribute to how
they conduct our statecraft. One might think that President [Trump does
not reflect all of such traditions, but he does represent one of them:
**unilateralism**.]{.underline} [Historically, our self-image of
**exceptionalism**]{.underline}---we are selfless, we are free, and our
values are universal---[justified two very **different approaches** to
the **world**]{.underline}. [One was passive and believed we could serve
as a model to the rest of the world and the other was activist and
believed we needed to **export** our values to **others**]{.underline}.
For our first century, the American sense of exceptionalism justified
not being sullied by others, not being tied down by alliances, and not
having our freedom of action limited. America was not isolationist, it
was unilateralist. Throughout the 19th century, the U.S. did not shy
away from military interventions to protect our trade and commercial
interests internationally, fighting the Barbary pirates in North Africa,
sending the navy to open Japan and later to attack in Korea, and
deploying the marines to deal with the Boxer Rebellion in China.

However, [our interventions were generally not in the service of
**alliances** or for a **higher purpose**]{.underline}. [It was to serve
our **economic interests**]{.underline}. [Donald Trump **fits** that
**tradition**]{.underline}. [He even referred to our **exceptionalism
twice**]{.underline} in his inaugural address on Jan 20. [But his
version of exceptionalism is justified through an argument that we
should be **free** to do **whatever serves** our immediate
**interest**]{.underline}. He may not always frame his decision in terms
of the U.S. being a model for the rest of the world. But, [he certainly
does communicate a desire to succeed in **foreign
policy**]{.underline}---and for that he should have an interest in
conducting statecraft better.

### Pursuit Inevitable\-\--Ext\-\--Public

#### The [majority]{.underline} support hegemony\-\--[especially]{.underline} MAGA. 

**Thiessen '25** \[Marc; June 22; Bachelor of Arts degree from Vassar

"MAGA voters back Trump on Iran and reject isolationism,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/06/22/maga-rejecting-isolationism-iran-china-polling/\]

In fact, the opposite is true. As I pointed out in a column last year,
the [Reagan Institute's 2024 polling showed that not only do MAGA
Republicans **reject** the **isolationists**]{.underline}, [but they are
also more **hawkish** and **supportive** of **U.S.
leadership**]{.underline} on the world stage than establishment
Republicans.

[This year's poll suggests they have become **even more
so**]{.underline}, and not just when it comes to Israel and Iran. On
virtually every metric measured --- [from support for **Taiwan** and
**NATO** to concerns about **democracy**, **h**uman **r**ights,
**China** and **U.S. leadership**]{.underline} --- [self-identified MAGA
Republicans are more supportive of **strong**]{.underline},
[**principled** American **leadership**]{.underline} on the world stage
than their non-MAGA GOP brethren.

Rejecting isolationism

Last year's poll found that a [**51 percent majority** of MAGA voters
said the **U**nited **S**tates should]{.underline} be "more engaged and
**[take the lead]{.underline}**" [on **foreign policy**,]{.underline}
while [just 39 percent said the **U**nited **S**tates should
be]{.underline} "[**less engaged** and react to events]{.underline}."
[This year]{.underline}, the [number that said the United States should
be more engaged skyrocketed to **73 percent**]{.underline} --- a
stunning 22-point increase. Indeed, MAGA Republicans are more
[supportive of U.S. global leadership than **voters
overall**]{.underline} (**[64 percent]{.underline}**) [and
**Democrats**]{.underline} (**[65 percent]{.underline}**).

This year, [**74 percent** of MAGA Republicans said that]{.underline}
"[U.S. involvement with international affairs is **mostly beneficial**
for the U.S]{.underline}." (compared with just 60 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans), [including **92 percent** who said U.S. leadership
was]{.underline} "[essential for promoting trade and boosting the U.S.
**economy**]{.underline}" (compared with just 78 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans).

Not only do MAGA Republicans want America to lead, but [they also want a
U.S. foreign policy centered on **American values**]{.underline}. When
asked in 2024 if "the U.S. has a moral obligation to stand up for human
rights and democracy whenever possible in international affairs," 73
percent of MAGA Republicans agreed that we do. In 2025, that number rose
to 84 percent --- an 11-point increase. (In contrast, last year 69
percent of non-MAGA Republicans agreed, which rose slightly to 71
percent this year.)

Last year, a 93 percent supermajority of MAGA voters said that "a strong
U.S. military is essential to maintaining peace and prosperity, both at
home and abroad," while 90 percent of non-MAGA Republicans agree. This
year, the number rose slightly to 96 percent among MAGA Republicans, and
fell slightly to 85 percent among non-MAGA Republicans.

That said, Americans of all political persuasions say that politicians
should prioritize problems at home over foreign affairs, the Reagan
Institute poll finds --- including both MAGA Republicans (68 percent,
down slightly from 70 percent last year) and non-MAGA Republicans (66
percent, down from 68 percent last year).

NATO

[MAGA Republicans also strongly support the principle of **collective
defense** enshrined in **Article 5**]{.underline} of the NATO Charter.
[When asked last year if they would support]{.underline} "[the U.S.
responding with **military force** if a **NATO ally** in Europe was
**attacked**]{.underline}," [fully **69 percent** of MAGA Republicans
said they **would**]{.underline} (vs. 63 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans). [This year]{.underline}, that number [**rose** slightly to
**71 percent** among MAGA voters]{.underline}, while it slightly fell to
61 percent among non-MAGA Republicans.

Last year, a 53 percent majority of MAGA Republicans said they held a
favorable view of NATO, slightly higher than non-MAGA Republicans (50
percent). This year, that favorable view fell slightly among MAGA voters
to 48 percent, but rose among non-MAGA Republicans to 59 percent. And if
Trump decided to withdraw from NATO, 57 percent of MAGA Republicans
would back such a move, while 51 percent of non-MAGA Republicans would
oppose it. But [56 percent of MAGA Republicans would support
**increasing** the U.S. military presence in **Eastern Europe** to
counter **Russian aggression**]{.underline}, compared with 51 percent of
non-MAGA Republicans.

China and Taiwan

[MAGA Republicans are more **hawkish about China**]{.underline} than
non-MAGA Republicans. This year's poll finds [81 percent of MAGA
**supporters** concerned about a **potential war** between China and
**Taiwan**]{.underline} ([compared with **73 percent of** non-MAGA
Republicans]{.underline}). And 73 percent of MAGA Republicans said that
they supported "taking military action to defend Taiwan" if China was to
attack or blockade the island, compared with just 62 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans.

MAGA voters are also extremely concerned about China's human rights
violations, including its treatment of Hong Kong and the Uyghurs (78
percent); China's expanding influence in South Asia, Africa and South
America (83 percent); China holding \$760 billion in U.S. government
debt (85 percent); China developing artificial intelligence technology
more advanced than that of the United States (85 percent); China
overtaking the United States as the world's No. 1 superpower (86
percent); China purchasing U.S. farmland near military bases (90
percent); China's theft of U.S. technology (91 percent); and China
spying on the United States with satellites and air reconnaissance (91
percent).

Trump has a clear mandate from the MAGA movement to take a hard line
with Beijing and stand up to any aggression against Taiwan.

U.S. territorial expansion

Far from supporting isolationism, [MAGA Republicans embrace **manifest
destiny** and strongly back Trump's plans for U.S. **territorial
expansion**]{.underline}. [**Eighty percent** support making Greenland
part of the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} "to provide the U.S. with
critical minerals and increased access to the Arctic" (compared with
just 50 percent of non-MAGA Republicans) [and **89 percent** support
taking back the **Panama Canal**]{.underline} "to protect a strategic
transit route and counter Chinese influence over the Canal" (compared
with just 57 percent of non-MAGA Republicans).

A 54 percent majority of MAGA voters support even Trump's proposal to
take over the Gaza Strip and "transform the region into a hub for
tourism and economic growth" (just 29 percent of non-MAGA Republicans
support such a plan, while 62 percent oppose it).

The poll did not ask how many supported making Canada the "51st state."

Promoting freedom and democracy

MAGA voters believe in a moral foreign policy. When asked whether
"funding programs and organizations designed to advance freedom and
democracy abroad" is "generally beneficial to the U.S. and its
interests" or "not worth the expense," a 54 percent majority of MAGA
voters said they were beneficial (compared with just 48 percent of
non-MAGA Republicans), while just 36 percent said they were not worth
the expense.

They are more ambivalent about specific organizations that Trump's U.S.
DOGE Service, or Department of Government Efficiency, has put on the
chopping block. Sixty-five percent supported cutting funding for the
National Endowment for Democracy, compared with 45 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans; and 69 percent supported cutting funding for Voice of
America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, compared with 50 percent of
non-MAGA Republicans. (Disclosure: I serve on the board of RFE/FL.) But,
after hearing arguments in favor of funding those groups, including that
they "help combat extremism and authoritarianism abroad," MAGA support
rose to 68 percent.

Protectionism and tariffs

[MAGA Republicans overwhelmingly back tariffs as an appropriate
**instrument of coercion** to advance **U.S. interests**]{.underline}:
86 percent agree that tariffs should be used as a "[tool of **foreign
policy**]{.underline}" (compared with just 56 percent of non-MAGA
Republicans). And they disproportionately support Trump's decision to
impose tariffs on specific countries, including U.S. friends and allies:
More than 7 in 10 MAGA Republicans support tariffs on Canada, Mexico,
Japan, South Korea, Britain and the European Union, while only about 4
in 10 non-MAGA Republicans do. The one exception: Both MAGA (77 percent)
and non-MAGA (65 percent) Republicans support tariffs on China.

[But MAGA voters are **not** **protectionists**]{.underline}. When asked
whether "[the U.S. should favor more of a **free market approach** with
temporary and selective tariffs]{.underline}" or if they support "more
of a protectionist approach with broad, long-term tariffs," [**61
percent** said they supported the **free market approach**]{.underline},
while just 29 percent supported the protectionist approach. MAGA voters
want Trump to use tariffs to force other countries to take down trade
barriers and open their markets to U.S. exports, but do not agree that
permanent tariffs are the best long-term strategy to raise revenue and
grow the U.S. economy.

What can we learn from these numbers?

First, the [GOP isolationists criticizing Trump's decision to join
Israel's assault on Iran are themselves a **tiny**, **isolated faction**
that has little support]{.underline}. They don't actually represent what
MAGA Republicans believe about foreign policy. And they don't represent
what Trump believes. This is a president who drove the Islamic State
from its caliphate --- and killed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi;
bombed Syria (twice) for using chemical weapons on its people; armed
Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles; and killed Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani. Anyone who
thought the man who took out Iran's terrorist mastermind would be
unwilling to take out Iran's Fordow nuclear fuel enrichment plant did
not know Donald Trump.

4 GENERAL DISCUSSION

Converging evidence across two experiments demonstrated the [**positive
effect** of **procedural fairness** on subsequent **cooperative
expectations** as well as **cooperative behavior**]{.underline}.
Moreover, the findings corroborate the view that procedural fairness
promotes cooperation because it [serves as a cue for people to form
expectations about their interaction partner\'s
cooperativeness]{.underline}. This was observed [regardless of whether
the **partner** was (Experiment 1) or was not **involved** (Experiment
2) in the prior **procedure**]{.underline}.

As noted, although past research has revealed that procedural fairness
is one of [the crucial **antecedents** of cooperation in **social
dilemmas**]{.underline} (De Cremer & Van Knippenberg, 2003; Sun et al.,
2021), the underlying mechanism for this relationship was not yet clear.
By exploring the role of cooperative expectations in the effect of
procedural fairness on cooperative behavior, the current work increases
the understanding of how and when people may be likely to cooperate
under social uncertainty. Our findings show that participants were [more
likely to cooperate after having experienced a **procedure** that **they
considered relatively fair**]{.underline} (i.e., allocation by
coin-flip) than after having experienced a procedure they considered
relatively less fair (i.e., allocation by choice). Importantly, the
fairness of procedures increased cooperation by increasing expectations
that others will cooperate. These findings matched prior findings that
observed positive correlations among trust (i.e., positive
expectations), procedural fairness, and cooperation indicators (e.g.,
job performance, cooperation intentions) (e.g., Colquitt et al., 2012;
Hadi et al., 2020; Nelson et al., 2019). Our research thus provides
direct evidence for prior fairness theories suggesting that people rely
on procedural fairness information to form expectations and to decide on
subsequent behavior when they are uncertain about their interaction
partner\'s cooperativeness (Lind, 2001; Proudfoot & Lind, 2015; Van den
Bos et al., 1996).

\<\<Condensed None Omitted\>\>

The current findings highlight the importance of fairness considerations
for the forming of cooperative expectations. At a more general level,
the findings may connect to literature on person perception. In
particular, theory and research on social evaluation have identified
several dimensions that carry great weight. In a recent article, Abele
et al. (2021) discussed the most studied dimensions. Some of these
features relate include elements that are related to fairness. For
example, evaluations of warmth (see e.g., Fiske, 2018), communion (see
e.g., Abele & Wojciszke, 2007), and morality (see e.g., Ellemers, 2017)
are related (but not identical) to fairness evaluations. Our findings
that connect procedural fairness to social (cooperative) expectations
and cooperation may fit these more general models by highlighting the
importance of fairness. It would be interesting for future research to
see whether there are other implications as well. For example, the
models on social evaluation also suggest that some dimensions have
priority over others and that, for example, people react more negatively
to those who score low on warmth or morality than to those who score low
on agency or competence. A possible avenue for future research could
then be to see how procedural fairness information impacts evaluations
of other\'s NC. Such research could, for example, investigate whether
people are more willing to sanction noncooperative others after having
experienced procedural fair procedures. At this point it may be
interesting to elaborate on the fact that the positive effects of
procedural fairness extended to a setting in which participants
interacted with a person who was not involved in their prior procedural
fairness experience (Experiment 2). Similar to the insights in trust
research that distinguish between personalized and generalized trust
(e.g., Acedo-Carmona & Gomila, 2014; Yamagishi & Yamagishi, 1994), this
suggests that procedural fairness effects are more than person-specific
and may generalize to others who had no role in the personal fairness
experience. This fits with the notion of fairness heuristic theory
(Lind, 2001) that procedural fairness may be used as a cue to generate
interpersonal trust and thereby promote cooperation. Also note, however,
that this carry-over effect resembles those found in the domain of
distributive fairness (i.e., perceived justness in the distribution of
resources or outcomes), showing that people are more cooperative after
receiving a fair (vs. unfair) outcome, even towards uninvolved others
(Gray et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). This suggests that at a more
general level, similar processes may be at work. A possible connection
could be that a fair (vs. unfair) procedure may---like receiving a fair
(vs. unfair) outcome---be considered as kind and fair behavior (De
Cremer & Tyler, 2007), which induces individuals more likely to have a
general positive view of others and hence, have positive expectations
towards others. It is also relevant to address the issue of causality.
Similar to previous accounts, our theoretical framework assumes that
people determine their cooperation (at least partially) on the basis of
the cooperative expectations they have of others, and that the effects
of procedural fairness on cooperation run via the expectations people
form. The mediation analyses we presented fit with that account. It
should be noted, however, that one could also envisage other paths. One
interesting path may be derived from recent research by Doyle (2021) on
the role of cultural beliefs about trustworthiness in social dilemmas.
Doyle argued that cultural beliefs may promote cooperation because
people expect that others will cooperate, but also because they expect
that others expect similar behavior from them (see for related ideas on
higher order inferences e.g., Correll et al., 2017). One might wonder
whether similar inferences could operate in our studies as well such
that cooperative participants may have reasoned that their cooperation
partner expected them to cooperate as well. We did not test this, but we
could envisage such an effect. Whether this would be especially likely
after having experienced procedural fairness is an issue that can be
tested in future research. As for the more specific features of our
research design, it may also be interesting to further discuss the
experimental inductions we used to manipulate the procedure. In all
conditions, the procedure could not affect the outcome because whether
the allocation was made by chance or by choice, the allocator never knew
what was in the envelope. This suggests that there may be something
inherently procedurally fair to an explicit chance procedure like a
coin-flip (over choice procedure). This might explain why people
recommend chance procedures under circumstance like having to choose one
of the two things that both are appealing, or settling a dispute between
two persons who both want to play first in a game. Future research may
further address what exactly it is that makes a chance procedure like a
coin-flip appears so procedurally fair. One possibility that we suggest
here, is that a chance procedure like a coin-flip to determine which
envelope will be opened more explicitly disassociates the outcome from
people\'s preference than a procedure where someone chooses between two
sealed envelopes. In this way a coin-flip procedure may be less
associated with personal responsibility, which is a proposition that
could be tested in future research. Future research could also benefit
from examining other forms of procedural fairness, such as giving people
voice (Thibaut & Walker, 1975), or striving for consistent application
of rules (Van den Bos et al., 1996). Literature on organizational
behavior argues that fair procedures generally symbolize that people are
valued and respected by others (Lind & Tyler, 1988), which may also
promote cooperation. Given these insights, it would be interesting to
examine to what extent self-worth and belongingness can also serve as
potential mediators, and to what extent the underlying process (hence,
the type of mediation) by which procedural fairness may promote
cooperation may be contingent on the specific form of procedural
fairness. It is our hope that studies along these lines will further
enhance the insight in the intriguing relation between procedural
fairness and cooperation. 5 CONCLUSION

\<\<Paragraph Break Resumes\>\>

The studies we presented underscore the importance of procedural
fairness for promoting cooperation. The effects of being treated fairly
or unfairly extend beyond cooperation with those we hold responsible for
the procedures used. Moreover, the effects are---at least
partly---explained by its effect on how we expect others to behave. In
terms of trust, the process we revealed suggest that the experience of
being unjustly treated may reduce people\'s (personalized and general)
trust in the cooperation of others, which may reduce their willingness
to cooperate. In this sense, [**procedural unfairness** may lead to a
**self-fulling deterioration** of **cooperation**]{.underline}. On the
positive side, the current studies also suggest that by using fair
procedures cooperation can be increased. [Promoting procedural fairness
may then be an effective means **organizations** and **institutions** to
reach **collective goals**---not only by communicating **respect**, but
also by fostering **positive expectations** about others\' willingness
to cooperate]{.underline}.

The present research aimed to investigate the [link between students'
experience of **(un)fairness** when interacting with their
**university** teachers and their trust in **science** and
scientists]{.underline}. Drawing from previous studies on the role of
justice in educational settings, we hypothesized that [interacting with
teachers perceived as respectful, unbiased, understanding and ready to
hear student voices would shape students' trust in science
generally]{.underline}. We also expected the same effect of the
subjective experience of justice on students' trust in scientists, a
separate but related measure. Finally, we aimed to grasp the underlying
mechanisms better by testing a model using procedural fairness as the
independent variable, trust in science as the dependent variable and
trust in scientists as the mediator. We expected that trust in
scientists would at least partly account for the effect of procedural
fairness on students' trust in science.

Our results support all three hypotheses. In Study 1, we aimed to check
whether there is a relationship between students' experience of
procedural justice during their studies and their trust in science. We
observed that Polish students' [experience of fairness served as a
**positive predictor** of their **trust** in **science**]{.underline}.
This finding is important because university students' trust in science
cannot be taken for granted. Cobern et al. (Citation2022) found that the
majority of students preparing to become science teachers at a
university in the US Midwest declared only limited trust in scientific
knowledge. In response to this surprising finding, they point to the
paradoxical nature of trust in science. Science can be perceived as a
type of activity that produces knowledge that is strictly validated,
subject to replication and independent verification. These safeguards
would seem to eliminate the very need for trust, which is often defined
as an attitude towards the veracity of claims that cannot be
independently verified. However, from the viewpoint of individuals,
including the researchers themselves, independent verification of even a
minor fraction of the enormous scientific output is impossible. Even
scholars working in their respective narrow fields need to trust other
scholars. Therefore, it matters that the experience of fair treatment
(i.e. procedural justice) helps build trust in science.

In Study 2, we replicated this key finding using a British sample. We
also found that students' trust in scientists mediated the relationship
between the experience of procedural justice and trust in science. In
other words, students who experienced fair treatment had more trust in
science because they learned to trust the scientists they knew
personally. Finally, in Study 3, we replicated the main findings from
both the previous studies using the American student sample. Moreover,
[students who **experienced fairness** were **less likely** to believe
in **conspiracy theories** about **COVID-19 vaccines**]{.underline}.
Thus, we were able to demonstrate that the effects of fair treatment on
respondents' trust in science were [universal across three substantially
different **national** and **educational contexts**]{.underline}.

[implicit]{.underline} attitudes even if we know '[it's just a
game]{.underline}.'**

6\. Discussion

6.1. General effect of narrative video games on attitudes

On the [**most** general level, available **evidence**
indicates]{.underline} that narrative video **[games]{.underline}** do
[affect **attitudes** towards the **depicted topics**: both explicit and
implicit]{.underline}. As we have already mentioned, video games today
are not only a popular leisure time media in our societies; they are
[increasingly being used for **personal storytelling**]{.underline},
news reporting, cultural narratives, [and **political
propaganda**]{.underline} (Zimmerman 2013). The fact that [games seem to
have a **marked impact** on **attitudes**]{.underline} is [crucial for
**debates**]{.underline} [about the way they represent our]{.underline}
world. For instance, narrative video games' [**representations** of
marginalized groups]{.underline}, history or gender stereotypes are,
according to these findings, [**transcending** the **medium** itself and
affect our **daily lives** and our **interpretation** of the
world]{.underline}.

Beyond this general finding, we have also examined multiple moderators
of this global effect: like intervention duration, different game design
models embedded in video games, and other methodological aspects of
research designs utilized in this field.

6.2. Intervention duration

Evidence related to Hypothesis 2 was rather mixed. The intervention
duration did not prove to have the presumed effect on explicit attitudes
(H2a). Nevertheless, the longer intervention duration resulted in larger
effect sizes on implicit attitudes (H2b) as presumed.

This means that the longer one plays the narrative video game, the
larger the impact it has on their implicit attitudes but not necessarily
on their explicit attitudes. These findings support the idea
theoretically posited by the APE model: that implicit attitude change is
caused by the frequent co-occurrences of the measured concept with
another concept of positive or negative value. As exposure time seems to
be related to the magnitude of the effect on associations about conveyed
topics, this implies that narrative video games with longer durations
may have a more significant effect on players' attitudes.

Possibly, as regards the lack of support for H2a, the effect on explicit
attitude change may be tied to the role of participants' relationships
to the measured topic. Unlike implicit attitudes, explicit attitudes are
based on multiple, consistent, logical conclusions which reflect what
one considers to be truth. As such, the participants' relationships to
the topic is potentially of similar or greater importance than the
intervention duration. This has been suggested by a few studies. For
example, the results of studies by Kampf (2016) and Alhabash and Wise
(2015) indicate that belonging to a particular national group is crucial
for the effect of narrative video games on attitude change towards the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the parties involved.

The finding that the length of the intervention might not be essential
for changing explicit attitudes is also supported in the study by (Pena
et al., 2018). They collected data in the middle of the experiment and
at its end; participants' explicit attitudes towards the topic did not
change between those two data collection points even though the duration
of the intervention was doubled. However, more data is needed on that
issue.

6.3. Persuasive mechanics

Our results indicate that particular [**persuasive** game
**mechanics**]{.underline} (Stereotyping and Meaningful feedback) [have
a **larger effect** on implicit attitudes than others]{.underline} (H5).
On the other hand, we have found no support for the idea that
Perspective-taking and Meaningful feedback have larger effect on
explicit attitudes compared to the Stereotyping mechanic (H6).

These results suggest that [particular **game design patterns** linking
depicted topics with some characteristics may differ in their effects on
**implicit attitudes**]{.underline}. However, our findings regarding
explicit attitudes do not support our original prediction. There are two
possible explanations. First, similar to intervention duration, explicit
attitudes may be more prone to being affected by participants'
relationships to the measured concept (Alhabash & Wise, 2015; Kampf,
2016). Second, the chosen category Meaningful feedback is relatively
broad. However, that is speculation and further research needs to be
done to examine it.

On a general level, our findings about the persuasive game mechanics are
the first such complex data brought to the debate about which particular
game elements are responsible for attitude change. Focusing on game
persuasive mechanics, we have identified which game design patterns are
associated with changes in implicit attitudes. However, there was a lack
of such clear signals in the domain of explicit attitudes. This
particular area of research is still in its beginnings, but [our
findings are not only relevant for mapping the effect of narrative games
on society, they also possess **unique value** for **game designers**
and experts in education]{.underline}. They [can help the latter groups
effectively develop games for change]{.underline}. Nevertheless, more
studies are needed to fully understand the particular game mechanisms
that are affecting our attitudes.

6.4. Action vs Non-Action games

Our analysis did not prove different effect of narrative for action (H7)
and non-action games (H8) on implicit or explicit attitudes, so neither
hypothesis was supported. These findings suggest that, whether or not
the game put players in time pressure situations with a need for fast
reactions and a focus on hand-eye coordination, it has no noticeable
effect on players' attitudes. Therefore, the distinction between action
and non-action games does not seem to be key in research on attitude
change.

6.5. Comparator groups

Available evidence does not indicate that magnitude of explicit attitude
change is greater for control groups using topic-unrelated activities
than for those using topic-related activities (H3). We assume that the
reason games are more effective in attitude change than these more
traditional formats is that narrative video games require players to
interact with the depicted topics in game narratives in order to proceed
further in the gameplay; the games often offer players opportunities to
react to the depicted topics.

We have not identified any study allowing us to evaluate the hypothesis
related to control groups and implicit attitudes (H4). Therefore, we
were not able to test it.

6.6. Exploratory Goals: Gender and age effects

In our exploratory analysis, we have not identified any effect of gender
on the magnitude of attitude change. However, the data suggests that the
potential of video games to affect attitudes slightly decreases with
age. Again, these outcomes are of an exploratory nature and should be
approached with caution. A study by (Wang and Chen, 2006) suggests that
working memory could have a mediating influence on the effect of age on
attitude change. Specifically, that attitude change among older adults
(Mage = 74.97) relies more on argument quantity than argument quality
compared to younger adults (Mage = 20.03). The authors suggest this is
caused by the limits of working memory at a higher age. However, the
weighted mean age across the studies included in the present
meta-analysis was relatively low (Mage = 21.13), thus the suggested
limits of working memory are unlikely to be a reason for the difference.
Also, several studies disprove the general effect of age on
susceptibility to change in attitude (e.g., Krosnick and Alwin, 1989,
Tyler and Schuller, 1991). Accordingly, we see two other variables
possibly responsible for this age effect. First, video games as a format
may be a less accessible or trustworthy format for older generations.
Second, the relationship of older players to the depicted topics in
games might be different. All these interpretations require more data
for further clarification.

6.7. Summary of implications

In educational practice, our findings can be used in many positive ways.
For instance, [videogames can promote **better** and more **complex
understanding** of our past]{.underline}. They can also help in conflict
areas by [promoting less polarized views on the crucial
issues]{.underline}. Also, even in informal learning, messages and
**[mechanics]{.underline}** [**embedded** in video **games** can help to
achieve positive changes in our society]{.underline}, for example [by
**supporting positive views** on protecting our **environment** and the
subsequent **change of behavior**]{.underline}. In the context of how
widespread video games are, they should not be underestimated in how
easily they can speak to the key political or cultural debates we have
about the critical issues of the day. However, it should be borne in
mind that they can equally be misused for political propaganda.

[The **longer we spend** with the video the videogame the **larger
effect** they might have on our **implicit attitudes**]{.underline}.
[Thus, large commercial video games, in which players often spend
**dozens of hours playing**]{.underline} them [in **informal settings**
can be a very **influential medium** in terms of what themes they
**portray** and how they portray them]{.underline}.

## Land Trusts Neg

### T-Development\-\--Violation

#### If we're taking this at face value, land trusts do not directly develop, which proves our offense about mixing burdens.

[**As a factual matter, the land tenure system** in Indian country **has
neither created wealth nor encouraged**]{.underline} reasonable resource
[**development**. Allotment]{.underline} itself **[reduced economic
outputs]{.underline}** in Indian country. 275 Today, the restrictive
administrative regime and patchwork jurisdictional framework take the
blame for some of the worst and most persistent poverty in the United
States in Indian reservations. 276 [Economists have **repeatedly
shown**]{.underline} that [**the trust regime and jurisdictional
patchwork cause reduced investment** in Indian lands, as compared to
neighboring fee properties]{.underline}. 277 And [more than half
of]{.underline} \[\*534\] co-owned Indian [trust properties are
**currently idle or generating no income**]{.underline}. 278 Not
surprisingly, Indian people continue to suffer from extreme poverty,
with low rates of home ownership and a high degree of unemployment,
despite widespread land ownership on paper. 279

### No Solvency\-\--1NC

#### No solvency\-\--land tenure is plagued by [complexity]{.underline}, [uncertainty]{.underline}, and [high costs]{.underline}. 

Jessica A. **Shoemaker 17**, Assistant Professor of Law at the
University of Nebraska College of Law, J.D. from the University of

Sovereignty, and the Future," Michigan Law Review, Vol. 115, February

Finally, all of these [factors]{.underline} work together to [produce an
**extreme degree of uncertainty about otherwise basic property law
questions** in Indian country. Uncertain or indeterminate
laws]{.underline} make outcomes hard to predict. 132 [This kind of
uncertainty]{.underline}\--whether it comes [from ambiguous rules
or]{.underline} from [the proliferation of too many, highly specific
rules]{.underline}\--[**vastly increases the cost of any bargain,
transaction, use, or investment** by increasing]{.underline} the
[**transaction costs** and the **number of alternative scenarios** that
must be assessed before taking]{.underline} any [action]{.underline}.
133 As the jurisdictional discussion above suggests, despite the number
of dense and technical rules imposed on top of the various tenure
statuses in Indian country, tremendous uncertainty abounds about who has
which property rights, what those rights mean, and how one enforces
those rights among the three separate sovereign authorities and their
many varied institutional arrangements. The importance of this
uncertainty cannot be underestimated.

Within the basic parameters that [trust property is mostly
federal]{.underline} ([with some tribal influence]{.underline}) and that
[fee property is a mix of state and tribal rules]{.underline} (depending
on a host of factors), 134 there is tremendous uncertainty. [Because of
the ad hoc way jurisdictional conflicts are decided]{.underline} in
Indian country, [tribal, state, and local governments all operate in a
bit of a vacuum with **vast, unknown legal
questions**]{.underline}\--[and]{.underline}, therefore, **[ongoing
conflicts]{.underline}**\--[**about who governs where**. Huge, unsettled
questions remain about things that should]{.underline} otherwise [seem
basic within a land tenure system: Does a tribe have **property tax**
authority in Indian country? Over **which properties**? Who can exercise
**eminent domain**? How? **Who regulates what property uses on
which**]{.underline} \[\*510\] [**lands? Who defines** the **property
rights? How and where are disputes between owners** of different tenure
types **adjudicated**?]{.underline}

Tribes have broad, and often exclusive, jurisdiction over their own
citizens, especially in their reserved territories. 135 [Tribal
jurisdiction is]{.underline} more [constrained with respect to trust
property where the federal government acts as a **gatekeeper**
overseeing individual exercises of tribal sovereignty]{.underline}. 136
[Tribes have even less jurisdiction over non-Indian]{.underline}s. 137
For example, the Supreme Court recently held that tribes categorically
cannot restrict the alienation of non-Indian fee lands within
reservation boundaries. 138 However, the \"tribe may quite legitimately
seek to protect its members from noxious uses that threaten tribal
welfare or security, or from nonmember conduct on the land that does the
same.\" 139 [In the **vast gray area**]{.underline} between these
benchmarks, [jurisdictional disputes are left to federal common law to
be decided on a case-by-case basis, sometimes with exhaustion in tribal
courts first]{.underline}. 140 [**Different tests apply for when, where,
and how** the state or federal government can assert
jurisdiction]{.underline}. 141

Relatedly, in many contexts [questions]{.underline} even [linger about
where]{.underline} exactly [reservation boundaries are
drawn]{.underline}. The creation of \"[checkerboard]{.underline}\"
[jurisdictions, and the permanent residence of non-Indians within Indian
territories]{.underline}, have [informed the Supreme Court\'s unique
reservation diminishment or disestablishment cases]{.underline}. 142 The
presence of fee interests does not necessarily mean that reservation
boundaries should be redrawn in a diminished way to exclude swaths of
fee ownership. 143 Instead, the Supreme Court considers \[\*511\]
multiple factors to assess whether Congress intended to diminish
reservation boundaries\--sometimes, but not always, by the alienation of
tribal lands to non-Indians. 144

Finally, [in the land tenure context, **obscurity** also **exacerbates
complexity, despite a significant federal regulatory
presence**]{.underline}. 145 [Even if there were clarity about which
government]{.underline} or institution [regulates or governs a specific
property]{.underline} question in Indian law, **[the task of actually
locating the applicable rule is another matter]{.underline}**. 146
[Locating the applicable real property rule in Indian country is
difficult because of uncertainty about which sovereign has authority
over which property issues, the **density** of the relevant rules and
regulations, and the **inaccessibility** of some source
materials]{.underline}. 147 This occurs at the federal level because, in
practice, [there is often **significant variance between BIA offices**,
especially at the reservation-agency level, as to how]{.underline}
specific [real estate issues are addressed]{.underline}. 148 [Unwritten
and uncertain rules are difficult to act around, **even if** the other
direct]{.underline} transaction **[costs of the federal trust status
were not inhibiting]{.underline}**. 149 And [tribal laws can be
difficult to locate and]{.underline}, in some cases, difficult to
[research and find]{.underline}. 150 Historically, [the]{.underline}
\[\*512\] [BIA has]{.underline} also **[struggled even to account for
who actually owns what in reservation territories]{.underline}**. This
was the major basis of the Cobell class action lawsuit, 151 which the
federal government is now paying \$ 3.4 billion to settle. 152

\*\*\*\*\* [**All of these variables get swirled together**. Indian land
tenure is a **fundamentally complex legal system**]{.underline}, 153 and
[this]{.underline} complexity [bears down on **every property decision**
within reservation spaces, **as well as the quality and success of
efforts to improve the system more broadly**]{.underline}. It is
complicated. It is dynamic. And it has costs.

#### BIA fails\-\--they never adequately represent tribal interests and actively misappropriate funds. 

Jessica A. **Shoemaker 17**, Assistant Professor of Law at the
University of Nebraska College of Law, J.D. from the University of

Too much [complexity]{.underline} also **[increases governance
costs]{.underline}**. 165 Having three separate sovereigns to regulate
the same underlying subject matter wastefully duplicates government
efforts. Governance costs also increase when these [three sovereigns
have to make predictions about, and negotiate around, uncertain
jurisdictional boundaries]{.underline}. Even more specifically, the
complexity of Indian land tenure seems to exacerbate bureaucratic costs,
and, in many instances, the persistence of undesirable levels of federal
interference and control in tribal territories.

[Structural elements of Indian land tenure favor]{.underline} an
**[ever-growing]{.underline}** role for [federal oversight and
administrative functions]{.underline}. As Indian landowners rationally
withdraw from active use and engagement of their own land, [the BIA\'s
ongoing and increasing role as replacement land-manager, record-keeper,
and monitor becomes more justified]{.underline}. If landowners are not
actively engaged, federal land oversight becomes more important to keep
the system propped up and operating, and therefore the federal agency\'s
role only grows as the \"need\" for oversight increases.

Any general political-economy analysis would suggest that bureaucratic
agencies tend to benefit from bureaucratic proliferation and increasing
control. 166 In some sense, complexity continues to employ people; it
does keep the BIA very much in business. 167 In addition, [increasing
regulatory complexity]{.underline} also [makes agencies less
**susceptible to public monitoring and control**]{.underline}. 168 This
played out, for example, even during the Termination Era of federal
Indian policy, when [the BIA]{.underline} \"[kept talking about working
itself out of a job and turning over responsibility to the
Indians]{.underline},\" [but the actual effect was]{.underline} that
\"[congressional appropriations to Indian tribes **decreased by
approximately 80%**]{.underline}, while appropriations to \[the BIA\]
(chiefly for salaries) increased by approximately 53,000.% \[sic\].\"
169 Today, similar incongruities \[\*515\] emerge. Economists Jacob Russ
and Thomas Stratmann estimated that, [despite decades of legislative
efforts to streamline BIA procedures and reduce]{.underline} overall
[land-management costs, the BIA\'s costs are **steadily
increasing**]{.underline}\--as much as \$ 7 million more per year on
just twelve reservations surveyed. 170 This represents a \"fivefold
increase\" in BIA recordkeeping costs at these twelve sample
reservations alone. 171 Russ and Stratmann estimate BIA\'s total
recordkeeping costs at \$ 575 million annually, 172 with probate and
other costs on top of this. 173

To be fair, much of this modern spending does get passed on to tribal
governments, who have the option to contract with the federal government
to perform line-level agency work on behalf of the BIA. 174 These tribal
agencies operating under federal contracts to perform these regulatory
functions are still, however, subject to federal authority and control
of the process. 175 Although the BIA\'s own staff numbers have declined
in recent years due to the tribal contracting process, [the
bureaucracy\'s]{.underline} total [administrative reach has **continued
to expand**]{.underline} (as have its costs, both in terms of
transaction costs to landowners and total costs to taxpayers). 176 At
the same time, [other pressing needs in Indian country go
**unmet**]{.underline}, and [overall federal funding in Indian country
is]{.underline} \"**[disproportionately low when compared to overall
funding levels]{.underline}** for Americans.\" 177

This [bureaucratic persistence and expansion is problematic]{.underline}
on many levels. Most directly, in the case of many individual Indian
estates, [the costs of the BIA\'s land maintenance and management role
**exceed the value of the underlying asset**]{.underline}. 178 This is
strikingly irrational. But, more subtly, we have to acknowledge two
related harms: [In the role of land-use decisionmaker, as opposed to
trustee]{.underline} (in which its true function is to advise and
support tribal sovereignty), [the **BIA has different incentives** than
the tribe or individual]{.underline} \[\*516\] [landowner might have
directly]{.underline}. 179 [The BIA is **risk averse** and will make
decisions to avoid potential liability for breaches of its trust
responsibility]{.underline}. 180 More broadly, [neither Congress nor the
BIA is in **any position** to make local decisions that reflect nuanced,
tribe-specific values and policy choices]{.underline}. 181 Instead,
**[the proliferation of the BIA\'s land-management
regime]{.underline}**\--**[even when contracted wholesale to tribal
agencies]{.underline}**\--[**critically reinforces and exacerbates the
problem of landowner withdrawal**. More bureaucracy **increases
landowners\' costs and**]{.underline}, ultimately, further
**[discourages landowner engagement]{.underline}**. 182

### No Solvency\-\--2NC

#### Err neg\-\--tribes won't see the [ideal version]{.underline} of the aff their J.D. candidates do.

Finally, [because complexity makes it difficult to read and understand
the]{.underline} full [land tenure challenge, it **limits the ability
of**]{.underline} even **[sincere reformers to tackle large-scale
change]{.underline}**. 183 [Legal rules that are too
complex]{.underline} can [suffer from a **lack of informed
dialogue**]{.underline}. 184 [It is challenging to have effective
democratic engagement around rules we cannot understand]{.underline}. A
system\'s [participants often have important information, which
lawmakers need]{.underline}, about the actual effects of policy choices,
[but when rules are too complex]{.underline}, these [interactions are
not easily observed or communicated, **impeding public input and
participation**]{.underline}. 185

\[\*517\] This [lack of dialogue]{.underline}, in turn,
[provides]{.underline} excellent [cover for the persistence of
**maladapted property rules**]{.underline} ([and **cost ineffective
bureaucracy**]{.underline}). 186 [Even well-intentioned
reformers]{.underline} may **[fail to account for]{.underline}** all of
the possible [**system-wide effects downwind**, leading to
**counterproductive results**]{.underline}. Complexity, then, gives rise
to a special kind of paralysis. [It is hard to know how best to respond,
given a likely **cascade** of additional, but relatively unknowable,
consequences in an interlocking and difficult system of complex
variables]{.underline}. Faced with such a risk of failure, [we can end
up with a **persistent**]{.underline}, even if unsatisfactory, **[status
quo, or]{.underline}**\--perhaps worse\--[with tinkering around the
edges that **does more harm than good. This occurs often in Indian
law**]{.underline}, as in the examples that follow.

P85 The conversion process is similar today. [If a tribe or an
individual]{.underline} member [has the revenue to purchase the
land]{.underline}, these [fee lands are **held in flux**]{.underline}
for several years [while the BIA completes the **tedious** and
**complex** administrative **fee-to-trust process**]{.underline}. 253
Fee-to-trust conversion is \"[**fraught with pitfalls** that can lead to
administrative appeals and federal court]{.underline}\" [by]{.underline}
individual [landowners or municipalities contesting the]{.underline}
individual\'s or the tribe\'s [application]{.underline} for conversion.
254 For the individual, [the process is **personally
degrading**]{.underline}: because [an Indian must declare that he or she
has **lost the capacity to manage her own** **affairs** and **ask for
assistance from the BIA**]{.underline}. 255 Conversely, changing land
from trust-to-fee status is quick and efficient. An Indian individual
simply applies for a competency evaluation and declaration by the BIA,
and in affirming capacity, the BIA releases the land from any continued
responsibility mandated by the federal trust status. 256 Considering
this, even in light of the IRA, [the history of federal/tribal relations
indicates a tendency towards the diminishment, rather than the
acquisition and consolidation, of Indian property]{.underline} since the
early twentieth century amendments to the Dawes Act. 257

#### They don't solve [complex questions]{.underline} about who is eligible.

Today, parallel mechanisms result in additional Indian trust land
passing out of trust and into fee by operation of law. Generally, [the
**U**nited **S**tates holds land in trust only for Indians to whom it
owes a trust responsibility]{.underline}. 76 Therefore, because the
United States has not accepted any parallel trust responsibility for
non-Indian citizens, when Indian-owned trust land transfers to
non-Indian ownership now, whether through a voluntary transfer approved
by Interior or by some other method, the land comes out of trust status
and a fee patent is issued in favor of the new non-Indian owner. 77 This
[conversion to fee status is considered automatic upon a valid transfer
of trust title to a non-Indian]{.underline}; therefore, even before the
fee patent document itself has been formally executed, Interior
disclaims any trust responsibility toward the land and considers it no
longer in trust. 78

[Who qualifies as Indian for whom land may be held in trust is a
**complex question**]{.underline}, and [distinguishing]{.underline}
Indian and non-Indian [landowners is **not always easy**]{.underline}.
[There is **no single universal definition of Indian** for purposes of
federal law]{.underline}, and [who is considered]{.underline} an Indian
[varies]{.underline} depending on the legal context. 79 In many
instances, however, [the definition]{.underline} of Indian
[requires]{.underline} some version of \[\*963\] (1) [descent from
indigenous peoples]{.underline} who were [living in what is now the
United States prior to European contact and]{.underline} (2)
[recognition of the individual as an Indian by the individual\'s
tribe]{.underline}. 80 [Tribal recognition]{.underline}, often in the
form of formal membership or citizenship in the tribal government, in
turn typically [requires demonstrated descent from identified
individuals on a historic roll]{.underline} of tribal members at a
particular point in time. 81 [Some tribes require a minimum blood
quantum]{.underline}, such as one-fourth degree of ancestry or blood
from ancestors of the particular tribe in question, but other tribes
permit any descendent to enroll, regardless of blood quantum. 82

#### Complexity makes [legal disputes]{.underline} inevitable.

University of Nebraska College of Law, J.D. from the University of

[Complex legal systems are the product of multiple
decisions]{.underline} made [by multiple authorities across multiple
scales]{.underline}. In any legal regime, differentiated \[\*499\]
statutory, regulatory, and adjudicatory authorities and overlapping
private and public ordering at multiple governance levels can create
complex challenges. [It is **difficult to direct
outcomes**]{.underline}\--**[or to identify a problem and solve
it]{.underline}**\--[if the system is]{.underline} actually [an
aggregate of multiple interlocking, but independent]{.underline} (or at
least nonlinear and uncoordinated), [variables]{.underline}. In Indian
land tenure, these challenges are particularly acute. Not two but
**[three separate sovereigns]{.underline}**\--**[tribal, state, and
federal]{.underline}**\--**[converge]{.underline}** in reservation
spaces, and [they create three related, but **fundamentally distinct**,
interlocking **legal systems** in which]{.underline} a multitude of
individual [landowners unpredictably operate]{.underline}. 63

Today, there is no such thing as a single \"reservation property\"
form\--rather, [there are]{.underline} three jurisdictionally discrete
land tenure statuses: [individual Indian trust, tribal trust, and fee
properties]{.underline}. 64 [Each]{.underline} tenure status
[incorporates]{.underline} a [different]{.underline} set of [rights and
responsibilities]{.underline} for owners, and these rules are set by a
mix of federal, state, and tribal jurisdictions. 65

Trust property can only be owned by Indians. 66 [Trust properties are
governed largely by the federal government, with some tribal
role]{.underline}. 67 [There are]{.underline} often [different rules
depending on whether the land is in \"tribal trust\" or \"individual
trust.\"]{.underline} 68 Importantly, Indian trust land passes out of
trust and \[\*500\] into fee status whenever it passes to a non-Indian
owner. 69 There are limits on when land can pass to non-Indians in this
way, 70 but when it does, the trust-to-fee conversion is automatic. 71

Fee status property within the reservation is, as a general matter,
categorically outside of the bureaucratic federal land-management system
for trust properties. This has advantages for landowner autonomy and
flexibility, but fee properties are also subject to state property
taxation, while trust properties are not. Fee properties are also
subject to a more unpredictable mix of state and tribal jurisdictions.
72 Fee properties within reservation boundaries can be owned by either
Indians or non-Indians. Indian-owned fee properties are typically
governed by the tribe, but are also often subject to state taxation and
an uncertain mix of other state and local controls, depending on the
exact identity of the owner 73 and where the property is located
(including the character of the surrounding reservation area). 74
Non-Indians cannot own reservation land in trust status but do own fee
lands within reservations. 75 These non-Indian fee landowners are not
citizens of tribal governments, which has complicated tribal assertions
of jurisdiction \[\*501\] over them. Therefore, non-Indian fee lands may
be subject to state or local authorities, and, only to a lesser degree,
tribal control. 76

[A **central challenge**]{.underline} of Indian law [is]{.underline}
that [non-Indian reservation landowners are not politically enfranchised
in tribal governments. Tribal governments]{.underline} possess their own
inherent sovereignty that predates contact with European settlers, 77
but, today, they [are subject to a federal plenary
sovereignty]{.underline}. 78 Originally, government-to-government
treaties between Indian nations and the new U.S. government promised
federal protection for indigenous nations\' exclusive rights to use,
control, and govern all lands within their reserved territories. 79 [The
federal allotment policy\'s pursuit of individual Indians\' assimilation
through private landownership]{.underline}, however, also **[transferred
significant Indian lands to non-Indians in fee status]{.underline}**.
The original purpose of introducing **[non-Indian fee
lands]{.underline}** in this way was to [**facilitate the termination of
tribes as tribes**, and]{.underline}, today\--[as a matter of federal
law]{.underline}\--[individuals who are not biologically
\"Indian\"]{.underline} (and, therefore, do not inherit the attendant
political rights) generally [cannot be recognized as citizens of the
tribal government]{.underline}. 80

Modern [concern about tribal authority]{.underline} over non-Indians,
even when they elect to enter tribal territories, [is rooted in this
**democratic-deficit problem**]{.underline}. 81 The Supreme Court has
expressed significant skepticism about subjecting non-Indians to tribal
laws that are foreign to them. 82 The Court has also emphasized that
Indian nations are \"outside the basic structure of the \[\*502\]
Constitution.\" 83 [Tribal law may]{.underline}, and often does, [treat
non-Indians fairly]{.underline}, 84 [but there is **no federal cause of
action** or waiver of tribal sovereign immunity that guarantees
non-Indians rights comparable to]{.underline} the [constitutional
ones]{.underline} protected by a U.S. court. 85

[The resulting owner-based]{.underline} (rather than territory-based)
[system of property sovereignty **makes land tenure more complex** in
Indian country]{.underline}. 86 [Trust and fee land owners
are]{.underline} often [subject to **different jurisdictions** and have
**vastly different property rights** depending on their tenure status,
even if their lands are immediately adjacent]{.underline} within one
reservation.

[This]{.underline} system [turns the typical relationship between
property and sovereignty on its head]{.underline}. Generally,
sovereignty encompasses dominion over territory, and part of a
sovereign\'s right and responsibility is to define, and then protect,
the institution of private property ownership for all persons and land
within that territorial domain. 87 In Indian country, [who governs
where]{.underline} often [turns **not on**]{.underline} the territorial
**[location]{.underline}** of the property, **[but]{.underline}**,
rather, on **[the identity of the owners, creating a
property-by-property]{.underline}** (or interest-by-interest)
**[jurisdictional mix-and-match that is disjointed, difficult, and
costly to operate]{.underline}**. 88 [Individual landowner
decisions]{.underline}\--[whether to transfer to an Indian or a
non-Indian]{.underline}, for example, [or whether to hold in fee or in
trust]{.underline}\--[change jurisdictional dynamics at the individual
parcel level]{.underline}. In addition, [whole neighborhood demographics
and characteristics]{.underline}\--whether an area is predominantly
Indian or not\--[can]{.underline} also [shape wider regulatory authority
issues]{.underline}, such as which sovereign asserts zoning authority
where. 89

Moreover, the jurisdictional differentiation is even more complicated
than this construct of a property-by-property jurisdictional
checkerboard \[\*503\] suggests. 90 [Co-ownership]{.underline}, or
fractionation, [is **pervasive on Indian trust lands**]{.underline}. 91
Many of these [fractionated trust lands have]{.underline} \"**[tens or
hundreds of different owners]{.underline}**, all **[with varying levels
of interests]{.underline}**.\" 92 [Co-owners each possess small, but
undivided, shares of the whole parcel]{.underline}. 93 Today, many of
these jointly owned tracts are actually in a mixed tenure or
\"emulsified\" state, with some of the undivided interests held in fee,
and other undivided interests in the same property in individual and
tribal trust statuses. 94 These [mixed-tenure, emulsified properties
**exacerbate jurisdictional issues immensely** as governance is
differentiated in even more **finely grained** and
**difficult-to-distinguish ways**]{.underline}. These
[undivided-property co-owners]{.underline} often [have **completely
incongruent property rights** to the same resource]{.underline}. In
terms of overall complexity, in many scenarios jurisdiction is not only
differentiated parcel by parcel, but co-owner by co-owner (or subject
matter by subject matter, or right by right) within single tracts. 95

[Technicality is]{.underline} \"[a function of the fineness of the
distinctions a rule makes]{.underline}, the [specialized
terminology]{.underline} it employs, [and]{.underline} the [refined
substantive judgments it requires]{.underline}.\" 96 In this sense,
technicality is relative to the audience expected to interpret and
implement the rule. 97 [In Indian land tenure, landowners, their
advocates, and the government itself bear the cost of a **highly
technical legal framework**. Indian law]{.underline} is always postured
as the exception to \"regular\" rules. 98 It [incorporates a long and
vast, specialized legal history]{.underline} \[\*504\] that is [**not
easily accessible** to a spontaneous observer. In land tenure
specifically]{.underline}, many [property law terms have unique meanings
that depart from conventional understandings, which]{.underline} further
[**complicates engagement** by]{.underline} both [landowners and legal
advocates]{.underline}.

To start, many [law students complete an]{.underline} entire juris
doctor [degree with]{.underline} little or [no mention of]{.underline}
the tribal sovereign or [federal Indian law]{.underline}. Even the most
basic operative terms in Indian law\--defining Indian versus non-Indian,
understanding the difference between trust tenure status and fee
status\--are loaded with histories and multifaceted meanings that are
not readily accessible. For example, [the definition of]{.underline}
\"[Indian]{.underline}\" [**varies** according to the subject area, law,
and purpose]{.underline} for which it is being deployed. Indian [status
is defined with reference to both federal and tribal law]{.underline},
and [it incorporates]{.underline} a range of [nuanced,
individual-specific factors]{.underline}. 99 On top of this are a series
of other critical, but highly specialized relevant legal questions,
including whether and how Public Law 280 affects state and federal
jurisdiction in some, but not all, Indian reservations; 100 how the
Indian Reorganization Act may or may not uniquely affect alienation of
some lands within a given tribe\'s territory; 101 and the relevance of a
tribe\'s particular treaty history. 102 [There is also]{.underline} the
challenge of [**simply being able to decipher what an Indian landowner
owns**, which requires translation of a **federal inventory of an
individual\'s trust assets**]{.underline}\--**[a cryptic, mostly
numerical record of ownership]{.underline}**. 103 [A non-specialist is
unlikely to know enough to begin to ask these questions]{.underline},
and [even a specialist will find these distinctions and judgments
difficult to make]{.underline}.

In addition, [Indian land tenure introduces a]{.underline} whole [series
of **unique property law** twists that apply only in this
field]{.underline}. As just one example, Congress relatively recently
passed the highly technical American Indian Probate \[\*505\] Reform Act
of 2004 (AIPRA). 104 [AIPRA governs disposition of Indian trust property
upon an Indian landowner\'s death,]{.underline} whether through
intestate succession or testate devise. 105 But **[the rules are
difficult to understand and apply]{.underline}**. For example, a special
primogeniture, or \"single heir,\" rule applies to prevent intestate
distribution to multiple heirs, but only when the fractional
co-ownership interest to be distributed amounts to less than 5 percent
of the total ownership in the tract. 106 In addition, intestacy
distribution is limited to those who satisfy a detailed rubric of who
qualifies as an \"eligible heir\" and who does not. 107 Eligible heirs
have to be Indian (also specially defined for the purposes of this
statute), 108 \"lineal descendents \[sic\] within 2 degrees of
consanguinity of an Indian\[,\]\" or a co-owner of a trust interest in
the same property. 109 AIPRA also uniquely creates a presumption that
certain language in a will creates a joint tenancy with a right of
survivorship, 110 instead of the typical tenancy-in-common default that
applies in other contexts. Other detailed rules exist\--with multiple
layers of processes for each\--for things like tribal-purchase options
and landowner-consolidation agreements at probate. 111 Tribes are also
authorized, subject to federal approval, to adopt their own tribal
probate codes supplanting AIPRA\'s provisions 112\--requiring Indian
probate practitioners to assess what, if anything, the tribal law
provides, and to which interests it applies, including where an
individual Indian\'s estate may include trust assets located in
different reservations. 113

\[\*506\] The [partition rules]{.underline} under AIPRA [provide another
example. Outside of the Indian land tenure context, partition refers to
the absolute right of every co-owner of real property to exit the
co-ownership]{.underline}, either [by forcing a physical division of the
property or a partition sale with pro rata distribution of sale
proceeds]{.underline}. 114 [AIPRA did authorize a new partition sale
option]{.underline}\--but here, partition means a totally unique process
of executing a particular kind of forced sale [only available on
qualifying \"highly fractionated Indian lands\" after a **detailed
application process**]{.underline}, consent from at least 50 percent of
co-ownership interests in the land, and a mandatory appraisal review.
115 The ultimate sale must take place at an auction with limits on who
qualifies to bid, and with the caveat that the final price at auction
must at least match a previously determined, formal appraised value. 116
**[The process takes a master technician to accomplish]{.underline}**.
117

#### Independently, the federal government can individually disprove of [every project]{.underline}, even if the plan makes it theoretically legal.

As highlighted by the AIPRA discussion above, **[administrative regimes
are]{.underline}**, by definition, \"**[almost inevitably more complex
than legislation]{.underline}**,\" in large part [because
of]{.underline} the proliferation of [numerous and encompassing
regulations]{.underline}. 118 Indian [trust properties are regulated
primarily by the]{.underline} Bureau of Indian Affairs
([BIA]{.underline}) [and also, in some cases, by tribal administrative
agencies, who can contract with the federal government]{.underline} to
perform the BIA\'s role, albeit still subject to federal rules and
authority. 119 These authorities \[\*507\] cover nearly every aspect of
Indian trust property, including not only distribution of assets after
death, but also most inter vivos property rights, including all kinds of
real property transfers, and even an owner\'s ability to possess her own
land.

For example, federal law includes a near-absolute restraint on
alienation on Indian lands that limits any transfer, including
inter-family gifts, credit-securing collateral agreements, and, of
course, any kind of for-value transfers. 120 Under traditional property
law canons, free transferability is fundamental to a functioning
property system. 121 [In Indian trust land]{.underline}, however, [the
federal government **individually approves or disapproves every lease,
mortgage, and transfer**]{.underline}\--often [requiring a full
appraisal and a bureaucratic assessment of whether the transaction is in
the Indian landowner\'s best interests before deciding whether to
approve a request]{.underline}. 122 These alienation restraints may also
apply to a less certain degree to Indian-owned non-trust property. 123

[Use and possession of Indian land is]{.underline} also [comprehensively
regulated, largely by the federal government]{.underline}. Outside of
the Indian law context, any [co-owner of jointly owned land has a direct
right to use and possess her own land, subject only to the parallel
rights of any other co-owners and]{.underline} generally applicable
[land-use regulations]{.underline}. 124 In the Indian lands context,
however, the federal government now oversees even a co-owner\'s own use
of her trust land. 125 Under existing federal rules, Indian co-owners
have no direct right to possess trust properties absent a federally
approved lease or co-owner permission, and Indian owners must pay
fair-market-value rent for their own possession, at least to the other
Indian co-owners, and regardless of \[\*508\] whether these other
co-owners have actually asserted any interest in making use of the land
themselves. 126 In reality, all of an Indian co-owner\'s property rights
are mediated and defined through encompassing federal regulatory
structures. 127

Non-owners who seek to use Indian lands also must navigate each proposed
use through the regulatory process for acquiring consent from Indian
owners (or co-owners) as well as the BIA. Title 25 of the Code of
Federal Regulations is thick with Indian-specific land regulations to
direct this multi-actor process. For example, a proposed user of Indian
trust property would have to consult (and follow) Part 167 for grazing
permits, Part 169 for rights-of-ways over Indian lands, Parts 211 for
tribal mineral development and 212 for individual mineral development,
or any of the many respective subparts in Part 162 for various types of
Indian leases, with special sub-rules for agricultural leases, homesite
leases, business leases, energy leases, and other nonspecific,
nonagricultural leases. 128

In some cases, federal law allows tribal law to supplant federal rules,
but often only after a federal vetting and approval process for the
tribal enactment. 129 These tribal regulations would then apply, but
typically only to the extent they do not conflict with other federal law
or a more amorphous sense of the federal trust responsibility. 130

\[\*509\] On top of all this, [whether the tribe or state exercises
zoning or other land-use authority]{.underline} (from environmental
regulations to building-permit procedures) [is a **separate and
difficult jurisdictional question**]{.underline}. This [shifting
land-use authority can add additional layers of **dense**]{.underline}
(**[and hard-to-read]{.underline}**) **[regulation over reservation land
uses]{.underline}**. 131

### No Solvency\-\--Offense\-\--2NC

#### This is [offense]{.underline}\-\--landowners will [sell]{.underline}, driving [poverty]{.underline}, [homelessness]{.underline}, and [unemployment]{.underline}.

[Too much complexity can **drive out desirable activity** as
**participants elect to disengage**]{.underline} from the field. 158
[This withdrawal is rational]{.underline}, though socially undesirable,
[when **complexity becomes too costly**]{.underline} for individuals to
bear.

[Property law]{.underline} in particular [**requires stability** and
**clarity** so]{.underline} that [owners know their rights and
responsibilities and can invest in accordance with those]{.underline}
internalized [expectations]{.underline}. 159 Reservation landowners have
no such clarity. The [**jurisdictional complexity adds costs** to any
desirable land use]{.underline}. Simply det[ermining who governs what
is]{.underline} often **[fraught with peril]{.underline}**. 160 On top
of this, [Indian landowners bear]{.underline} the [assembly challenges
of fractionated ownership and the **burdensome**]{.underline}\--but
intermittent\--[**restrictions of the federal land-management regime**.
This]{.underline} complexity [**limits access to capital, directly
impedes flexible land use**, and **encourages disengagement** as **the
costs of active participation exceed the likely benefits**]{.underline}.
161

At the same time, [communities]{.underline} often [benefit]{.underline}
most [from local landowners making local uses of their
lands]{.underline}. 162 This is missing in many Indian communities. The
large majority of fractionated Indian lands are idle, not generating any
income, or, if they are in use, being leased to non-Indians. 163 Data on
other tenure forms in Indian country are harder to collect, but
\[\*514\] [terrible **poverty, homelessness**, and **unemployment**
persists]{.underline} throughout many reservations, despite widespread
land ownership. 164 **[Landowners\' withdrawal]{.underline}** may be
rational at the individual level, but it **[has pressing social costs at
the wider community level]{.underline}**.

#### This is a reason they lose under their own framing\-\--the land tenure system is [structurally unjust]{.underline}. 

Jessica A. **Shoemaker 17**, Assistant Professor of Law at the

[The]{.underline} predominantly [top-down federal land tenure
regime]{.underline} that persists today [continues to
impact]{.underline} not only Indian landowners, but also **[tribal
sovereignty]{.underline}** in many of the same inflexible ways. Just as
[indigenous nations historically had their own diverse land tenure
systems and property institutions]{.underline}, many Native scholars
continue to emphasize the unique modern relationship with the land that
persists in many American Indian communities today. 300 Before European
contact, indigenous nations had many various land tenure systems. 301
The nomadic tribes where systems were based on shifting hunting
territories typically had temporary use rights. 302 Farming tribes that
\[\*537\] were more settled often had more established guarantees of
individual possession. 303 In many indigenous cultures, however, land
has a fully different concept. 304 Thus, how we define legal rights to
land is critically important\--economically, but also socially and
culturally. 305 Our [systems of land tenure shape]{.underline} many
[other dimensions of human life: distributions of economic entitlements,
access to shelter and spaces for sustenance, and inclusion or exclusion
from community life]{.underline}. 306 In indigenous communities, land
and place are often particularly intertwined with religion and culture
and even identity as a \"people.\" 307 How we understand \"the
land\"\--our land ethic\--also shapes many other decisions. Are we
stewards of a sacred place? Is the land our responsibility to develop?
Are resources fungible commodities we should use before we lose? 308 In
this way, property law communicates social values.

Under this account of Indian land tenure, [the central problem is the
**completely dysfunctional governance systems** that created
this]{.underline} property [regime. Tribes **do not truly communicate
their land ethics or organize social relations** through the mess of
jurisdictional checkerboards, emulsions, and property-versus-sovereignty
stratifications]{.underline}. 309 Instead, [the system perpetuates a
**high degree of federal control** and]{.underline}, in areas of
uncertainty, [**sovereign-to-sovereign animosity** and
**land-use-related jurisdictional conflict**]{.underline}. 310

\[\*538\] One of the founding figures of the progressive property
school, Morris Cohen, argued that modern property rights are delegations
of state sovereign authority to private individuals, who receive rights
good against the world. 311 As such, allocations, distributions, and
definitions of individual property rights must be justified by the same
sense of morality and public good that any direct state action would
require. 312 It is striking how much of Indian land tenure is divorced
from this central tenet. Indian property rights are not allocated to
reflect sovereign values. Rather, [Indian property rights
are]{.underline} somehow [used to allocate jurisdictional rights between
sovereigns. This topsy-turvy reversal of how property and
sovereignty]{.underline} typically [work **does not achieve broad-based
flourishing**, reflective of indigenous social values, in Indian
communities]{.underline}. Even more troubling, [Indian
people]{.underline}, who are [uniquely subject to this perverse system,
are]{.underline} certainly **[not treated as human beings entitled to
the equal dignity and respect they deserve]{.underline}**. 313

#### The 'trust relationship' is rooted in [racist]{.underline}, [paternalistic logic]{.underline} that only aids in subjugating Indigenous people.

**[Racism has played a significant role in]{.underline}** United
States-Indian relations, and nowhere is this more obvious than **[the
\"trust relationship.\"]{.underline}** The trust relationship has been
repeatedly recognized by all three branches of the federal
government.147 What the federal government fails to mention is that [the
trust relationship is **overtly predicated on** notions of **Indian
inferiority**]{.underline}.\' In fact, [the trust relationship is little
more than a euphemistic rephrasing of]{.underline} Chief Justice John
[Marshall\'s pronouncement]{.underline} that [the relationship
between]{.underline} Indian [tribes and the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} \"**[resembles that of a ward to his
guardian]{.underline}**.\"149

Contemporary [Indian trust land can be traced to]{.underline} the 1823
decision of [Johnson v. M\'Intosh]{.underline}.150 In this case, the
[Court held]{.underline} that [Indian tribes lost ownership]{.underline}
of their land [when Europeans arrived]{.underline} on the continent;
however, the Indians maintained the right to occupy their land.151 The
Court reached this conclusion [by resorting to]{.underline} the Doctrine
of Discovery,1 a doctrine of [international law that **authorizes the
subjugation of non-Christian Europeans at the hands of Christian
kingdoms**]{.underline}.153 Chief Justice [Marshall stated]{.underline}
that [the Indians\' \"character and religion\" justified the \"superior
genius of Europe\"]{.underline}154 claiming control of all lands in the
Americas. Despite factual errors and patently racist language, Johnson
v. M\'Intosh remains binding precedent.155

The General Allotment Act of 1887 was designed to destroy Indian culture
by erasing Indian reservations and forcing Indians in- to the U.S.
mainstream.156 Under the Act, each head of household received 160 acres
of fee land that was placed in trust for twenty- five years.157 At the
end of the period, [the theory was]{.underline} that [Indians would
become farmers]{.underline} like their white counterparts [and own the
land outright in fee simple]{.underline}.158 None of this came to bear,
and this was no surprise. The legislative history of the Allotment Act
reveals the bill\'s authors intended the law to be a transfer of Indian
lands to whites.159

[Allotment proved]{.underline} to be [an **unmitigated
disaster**]{.underline} for Indians.160 Agricultural implements were
supposed to accompany allotments; however, the United States failed to
deliver on this promise, making it quite difficult for poor Indians to
become farmers.161 Furthermore, the majority of [land]{.underline} the
Indians were allotted [was unsuitable for farming]{.underline}.162 The
valuable land went to whites.163 In total, Indians lost ninety million
acres of their treaty-guaranteed land through the General Allotment
Act.164 A government report published four decades after the Allotment
Act found that all the Act did was cast Indians into tremendous economic
despair.165

Race played a vital role in the United States\' Indian land policy as
elucidated in 1906 legislation. The Clapp Amendment removed land
restrictions on \"mixed blood\" Indians of the White Earth Reservation
but kept \"full blood\" Indians of the White Earth Reservation under
federal wardship until \"the Secretary of the Interior \[was\] satisfied
that said adult full-blood Indians are competent to handle their own
affairs.\"f6 Congress also forbade citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes
who were \"full-blood Indian\" from conducting any land transaction on
their allotments without congressional approval. 167 And, through the
Burke Act, the twenty-five-year trust period could be discarded if the
Indian allottee was deemed \"competent\" as determined by a federal
\"competency commission.\"168 [One of the mechanisms used to measure
competency was **degree of Indian blood**]{.underline}; in fact, the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior adopted a policy that Indians with \"less
than one-half Indian blood\" were presumed to be competent.169
Contrarily, \"all adult Indians of one-half or more Indian blood\" could
only be found competent \"after careful investigation.\"170

Allotment and its assimilationist ideology ended in 1934 with passage of
the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA).171 Allotment was predicated on the
notion that Indian tribes should vanish, whereas the IRA was premised on
the belief that tribes should exist.172 Hence, [the IRA authorized the
restoration and expansion of tribal lands]{.underline}.173 In passing
the IRA, the United States acknowledged that the nation\'s prior Indian
policies had been patronizing and demeaning and had devastatingly
deleterious effects on Indians.174 The Supreme Court has described the
IRA\'s purpose as \"to rehabilitate the Indian\'s economic life and to
give him a chance to develop the initiative destroyed by a century of
oppression and paternalism.\"\" 5 Though the IRA is not without flaws,\"
it is undoubtedly positive legislation for tribes. Nonetheless, a
superabundance of federal regulations remain on tribal lands.\"

The [gobs of land regulations that apply nowhere else but Indian country
are **irrational** and **serve no legitimate purpose**. Trust land came
into existence because Indians were **deemed racially inferior** and
**consequently incompetent to own their land**]{.underline}.\" **[This
bigoted belief remains the cornerstone of Indian trust
land]{.underline}**. \" Today[, Indians are still required to prove
competency]{.underline} in order [to liberate their land from trust
status]{.underline},180 [and degree of Indian blood remains a factor
when an Indian seeks to liberate]{.underline} her [land from the federal
trust relationship]{.underline}.\'\' [The]{.underline} federal
government\'s [application of Indian blood rather than
citizenship]{.underline} in a federally recognized tribe [distinguishes
it from the constitutional tribal citizenship framework]{.underline}.182
Thus, arguably, the restrictions on trust land should be subjected to
strict scrutiny due to their racist origins. Regardless, the [federal
restrictions cannot survive under rational basis review
because]{.underline} the **[bureaucratic constraints on tribal land use
are irrational]{.underline}**.

The federal [restrictions on trust land **incapacitate tribal
economies** and **frustrate** tribal **self-governance**]{.underline}.
Unlike the Indian employment preference that was upheld in Morton v.
Mancari,83 **[federal trust land regulations do not further tribal
self-government]{.underline}**. Rather, [trust land does just the
opposite because trust land **requires tribes to seek federal approval**
for **nearly all activity**]{.underline} on trust land.184 [Federal
overlordship is the **antithesis of Indian
self-government**]{.underline}. The [bureaucratic fetters]{.underline}
that encumber trust land **[thwart virtually all efforts
at]{.underline}** Indian country economic
**[development]{.underline}**.185 [Studies consistently
show]{.underline} that [non-Indian fee land is **significantly more
productive**]{.underline} than adjacent trust land,\' [and]{.underline}
as additional proof of the failure of trust land, [the **U**nited
**S**tates has \"lost\" **billions** of dollars from Indian trust land
accounts.]{.underline}\'\' In the true spirit of inept federal
bureaucracy, the cost of administering trust land is often far more than
the value of the land itself 188 Tribes do not benefit when the federal
government controls their land.

[The federal government is **terrible at managing Indian land and
resources because the U**nited **S**tates **has no incentive to
behave**]{.underline}. Although the trust relationship between federally
recognized tribes and the United States is legally enforceable,189 [the
Supreme Court has gone to tremendous lengths to shield the federal
government from liability for]{.underline} even the most **[extreme
mismanagement]{.underline}** of Indian resources. 190 The Supreme Court
has held that [a tribe **cannot sue** the **U**nited **S**tates when a
federal official engages in overtly corrupt behavior]{.underline} to the
tribe\'s detriment191 [and]{.underline} has also ruled that [tribes
cannot]{.underline} even [access documents to determine whether the
**U**nited **S**tates has mismanaged a tribe\'s
resources]{.underline}.192 Decrying the Supreme Court\'s refusal to hold
the United States accountable for mismanaging tribal resources, Justice
Sotomayor has written, \"[had this]{.underline} type of [mismanagement
taken place in **any other trust arrangements**]{.underline} such as
Social Security, **[there would be war]{.underline}**.\"193

[As a result of]{.underline} the Secretary of the [Interior\'s
consistently **abhorrent supervision of Indian trust land**]{.underline}
and resources, one federal court opined:

> Alas, our \"modern\" [Interior]{.underline} department has time and
> again [demonstrated that it is a **dinosaur**-the morally and
> culturally oblivious hand-me-down of a **disgracefully racist** and
> imperialist **government that should have been buried a century ago**,
> the **last pathetic outpost of the indifference and anglocentrism we
> thought we had left behin**d]{.underline}.194

The federal government\'s [**totalitarian control of Indian trust land
must come to an end**. Land restrictions based upon the
belief]{.underline} that In[dians are incompetent **have no place** in
the twenty-first century]{.underline} United States.195 Plus, [the
federal government has proven itself **profoundly incapable of
administering Indian land**]{.underline}. The current [trust land
regulations are irrational and promote no legitimate government
purpose]{.underline}. The current federal restrictions on Indian trust
land are unconstitutional.

Despite some benefits for tribes, [**trust land comes with significant
burdens** such as **complex** and **burdensome federal regulations**
that make entrepreneurship much more costly]{.underline} on reservations
(Miller et al., 2019). Although tribal land ownership and sovereignty
are currently intertwined, this does not have to be the case as
[non-Indians who purchase land]{.underline} within a reservation [could
easily be subjected to tribal law]{.underline} (EagleWoman, 2009).
[Conditioning which law applies on]{.underline} the [ownership
status]{.underline} of the land [and whether an individual is an Indian
**increases**]{.underline} the [**transaction costs** of]{.underline}
engaging in [productive economic activity]{.underline} using resources
on reservation. Tribal sovereignty is more meaningful than it has been
in the past 200 years (Washburn, 2016: 207); nevertheless, [tribes'
sovereignty over their land and economic activities]{.underline}
occurring on it [remains **aspirational**]{.underline} across a number
of dimensions.

[Constraints]{.underline} on the free determination of property
institutions by tribes [are compounded by rules that impose different
burdens on Indians that the federal government does not apply to other
groups and quasi-sovereign entities]{.underline} in the United States.
One issue that has emerged due to the complexity of the institutional
history on reservation (due to Supreme Court precedent) is that
[different laws apply based upon whether a person is an Indian or
not]{.underline} (Anderson and Parker, 2008). Further [complications
arise]{.underline} as a result of **[dozens of definitions
of]{.underline}** the legal term **['Indian' in federal code, case law,
and tribal codes]{.underline}** (White et al., 2008). Another issue is
that [tribes are precluded from establishing a substantial revenue base.
Although states cannot tax trust land itself, **states can tax
commerce** that occurs on tribal trust land if people other
than]{.underline} citizens of [the tribe are involved]{.underline} in
the transaction. [This]{.underline} effectively [**prohibits tribes from
collecting taxes** because **no one wants to pay** both a tribal and
state tax when the tribal tax can be avoided by stepping off the
reservation]{.underline} (Crepelle, 2020). [The problem is further
compounded by a **lack of business activity**, which undermines tribal
revenue]{.underline}. Thus, even if we view the tribal governments as
subjected to federal oversight like other quasi-sovereign units (such as
state governments), Indian reservations face additional constraints.

A larger institutional challenge is that many [tribes still operate
under **culturally incompatible IRA constitutions** imposed on them by
the federal government]{.underline}. Cornell and Kalt's (1998, 2000)
finding that separation of powers is as important in Indian country as
anywhere else, especially to limit corruption, remains significant. For
example, those tribes that have successfully formed a strong and
independent judiciary have stronger economies (Crepelle, 2019). Even
with removal of federal regulations on Indian economies, [there remain
**political** and **legal challenges** to]{.underline} the creation of
more [effective property institutions]{.underline} on Indian
reservations. [The effectiveness of legal rights depends]{.underline} in
part [on **administrative capacity** and **political
constraints**]{.underline} on sovereign tribal governments, [as well as
judges and lawyers with expertise in Indian law, police who are
accountable for tribal citizens, and meritorious tribal
bureaucrats]{.underline}. Indians may choose private property rights
with greater self-determination. Our analysis suggests that [the
challenges remain of building political and legal autonomy and capacity
to enable greater self-determination of property
institutions]{.underline}. The gains from doing so are potentially
immense. [Entrepreneurial economic actors]{.underline} (whether American
Indian or no) [can be deterred from making productive investments due to
**chronic uncertainty** created by decades of mistreatment]{.underline}
under the extant political economies of the time. But the question
remains whether the predatory state can credibly commit to a durable new
institutional equilibrium on reservation. Our argument would suggest
that [the stability associated with credible state commitment is central
to determining long run economic outcomes]{.underline} (Broadberry and
Wallis, 2017), in addition to the specific institutional challenges that
any given reservation may be facing.

Indian country\'s regulatory structure is complex, and this is
particularly true of land tenure. There are three primary types of land
in Indian country\--fee simple, trust lands, and restricted fee lands.
76 The first type, fee simple land,77 is land an individual personally
holds title to which they may freely alienate. 78 Fee simple is the most
common land tenure form in the United States. 79 However, [Indian
country\'s predominant form is]{.underline} the second type: [trust
land]{.underline}.80 [Individuals **cannot own trust
land**]{.underline}; rather, [they can acquire use rights for it while
title remains with the federal government]{.underline}.78 Thus, [trust
land **cannot be conveyed without federal approval**]{.underline}. 82
The final primary type of land in Indian country is restricted fee
land.83 Although an individual Indian or the tribe owns restricted land,
interests in restricted fee land are nontransferable absent federal
approval. 84 Hence, restricted fee land is the functional equivalent of
trust land.85 Even if only a small portion of a tract of land is held in
trust or restricted status, a transaction that predominately involves
fee simple land is unlawful without first gaining the Secretary of the
Interior\'s approval. 86 [Discerning land status can require **lengthy
searches** of treaties, statutes, and other documents]{.underline}. 87
[This takes **time and money** that]{.underline} usually [does not have
to be expended on land outside of Indian country]{.underline}.

[Assuming a business wishes to operate]{.underline} on trust land, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs\' (\"[BIA]{.underline}\") [permission is
required]{.underline}88 [and obtaining]{.underline} the BIA\'s
[permission can take over a year]{.underline}.89 Indeed, [the BIA **must
approve the lease price**]{.underline} of individual Indian trust land90
[as well as the method by which the individual]{.underline} Indian [is
paid]{.underline}.91 [The BIA will not authorize a business lease
without \"\[e\]nvironmental and archeological reports, surveys, and site
assessments]{.underline} as needed to facilitate compliance with
applicable Federal and tribal environmental and land use
requirements.\"92 Relevant federal laws include the National Historic
Preservation Act,93 the Archeological Resources Protection Act,94 the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act95 and the
National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\"). 96

NEPA is triggered by \"major federal actions.\" 97 Ninety-five percent
of major federal actions receive categorical exclusions, 98 and the
projects can proceed in two days. 99 However, the Environmental
Protection Agency notes, \"[Activities in]{.underline} Indian country
and in other [tribal areas often require a **greater level of NEPA
involvement** than the same activities in non-tribal areas when
these]{.underline} activities [occur on tribal lands held in
trust]{.underline} by the federal government.\"100 This means, [**at
minimum**, an]{.underline} environmental assessment
(\"[EA]{.underline}\") [is usually required]{.underline} in Indian
country.\' 101 According to the Government Accountability Office
(\"GAO\"), [the average cost]{.underline} to complete an EA [is
\$**301,000**]{.underline}102 [and can **easily take six
months**]{.underline}.103 [Many]{.underline} Indian country [projects
will require **full**]{.underline} environmental impact statement
(\"**[EIS]{.underline}**\"). The GAO estimates [the average EIS costs
\$**6.6 million**]{.underline} 104 [and takes **4.6 years to
complete**]{.underline}. 105 [While a business is open and churning a
profit outside of Indian country, the same business in Indian country is
**suffocating in red tape**]{.underline}.106

Indian country land use has the potential to get even more complex. Due
to a long rebuked federal policy, 107 Indian land ownership has often
passed down to multiple heirs in undivided interests. 108 Today, most
Indian allotments have several owners.109 This [fractionated
ownership]{.underline} scheme [makes land use inefficient because it can
require the consent of numerous owners]{.underline}.\" 110
[Getting]{.underline} these [approvals can be **exceedingly
difficult**]{.underline}. Locating each of potentially hundreds of
owners can take an exorbitant amount of time.\"\' Owners also have an
incentive to negotiate for better prices. For example, an allotment with
five or fewer owners cannot proceed without the consent of ninety
percent of the ownership interest,\"112 so a single individual can hold
out for an above market price.\"113 Eminent domain is regularly used to
address holdout problems outside of Indian country;\"114 nevertheless,
solutions to fractionated Indian land ownership have proven more
difficult.\" 115 Hence, the transaction costs associated with
fractionation can render land economically worthless.\"116

Fractionation and bureaucracy are only two causes of land use
uncertainty. A 2009 Supreme Court decision cast a cloud over whether
tribes recognized after 1934 can have reservations,\" and based upon
this decision, the Department of Interior revoked the Mashpee
Wampanoag\'s reservation in 2020.118 Lack of certainty over whether land
qualifies as a reservation deters investment\" 119 because different
rules apply inside Indian country.120 Another issue is [contracts that
encumber Indian lands for seven or more years must be approved
by]{.underline} the Secretary of the [Interior]{.underline}.121
[Secretarial approval is a transaction cost]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
requirement\'s application **adds uncertainty** because \"\[t\]here is
**no clear answer**]{.underline} as [to whether a construction or design
contract is]{.underline} one [\'relative to\' their
lands.\"]{.underline} 122 [Adding **further complication**]{.underline}
to Indian land, [federal law prohibits tribes from selling land
they]{.underline} have [purchased on the private]{.underline} real
estate [market]{.underline}.123 Though the law is seldom enforced,124
[attempting to buy]{.underline} land [from an Indian tribe **subjects
the would-be purchaser to federal sanctions**]{.underline}. 125
[These]{.underline} factors [add **uncertainty to the already tumultuous
rules** governing Indian country land and drive businesses away from
Indian country]{.underline}.

[If a business manages to lease trust land, the business **must** then
**obtain an Indian trader license** to lawfully operate]{.underline} in
Indian country.126 [Acquiring the license requires the business to
establish its qualifications]{.underline} to operate in Indian country
[including the amount of capital to be invested as well as]{.underline}
the applicant\'s [relevant business experience]{.underline}.127 [A
license only applies to a single location]{.underline} within a
reservation 128 [and is nontransferable]{.underline}.129 Thus, [transfer
or expansion add the transaction cost of applying for an entirely
new]{.underline} Indian trader [license]{.underline} to cover the same
business.

Once the license is obtained, there are additional operational
considerations. The [business cannot purvey]{.underline}-[or even
possess]{.underline}-[**any goods** the federal government provides to
Indians]{.underline}.130 The [price]{.underline} of items sold by
licensed traders [must be \"fair and reasonable\" as determined by a
**federal inspection rather than the market**]{.underline}.131
Additionally, [the establishment of licensed Indian traders must be
managed by]{.underline} someone who is [a habitual resident]{.underline}
of the reservation.132 Although enforcement of the Indian trader
licensing requirement is rare,133 [the penalty for failure to obtain the
license is]{.underline} real-**[forfeiture of all merchandise in the
business\' possession]{.underline}**. 134 Thus, [Indian trader laws
serve as a **perpetual sword of Damocles for businesses operating Indian
country**]{.underline}.135 While Indian trader licenses may have served
a valid purpose in the nineteenth century when many Indians did not
speak English, the [laws serve no purpose]{.underline} in the
twenty-first century [other than **adding transaction costs** and
**uncertainty to Indian country business**]{.underline}.136

#### Onerous regulations block development, [even on trust land]{.underline}.

[The bulk of the regulatory trouble lies with trust land. Trust land is
**not freely alienable**]{.underline},73 [so those who wish to use trust
land **must lease it**]{.underline}.74 [Since the federal government
holds title]{.underline} to trust land,75 [obtaining a
lease]{.underline} on trust land [is an **adventure in federal
bureaucracy**]{.underline}. The Bureau of Indian Affairs
([BIA]{.underline}) has [designed specific regulations for business
leases. A business lease]{.underline} on trust land **[cannot take place
without the BIA\'s approval]{.underline}**.

[To obtain]{.underline} the BIA\'s [approval]{.underline} for a business
lease on trust land, [a company must provide a **litany of documents**
including archeological and environmental \"reports, surveys, and site
assessments\"]{.underline} that apply to federal and tribal land\' [as
well as \"a restoration and reclamation plan.\"]{.underline}\' Business
[leases must]{.underline} also [contain a clause requiring the company
to immediately cease activity if a previously unknown cultural item is
discovered]{.underline} on the leased property.80 [If a]{.underline}
business [lease includes permanent improvements, the lease must specify
the location and type of improvement in addition to a construction
schedule]{.underline}.\' [An enterprise that fails to complete a
permanent improvement]{.underline} within the specified time [is
required to explain the cause of delay to the BIA]{.underline}.82 Leases
can be amended to account for changes of circumstances; however, [the
BIA must authorize]{.underline} the [amendment]{.underline}.83 The lease
requirements are different for agricultural, 84 residential,85 and wind
and solar projects.86 The federal leasing regulations can also vary from
reservation to reservation.87

Obtaining a business lease is just step one. [Federal regulations
require non-Indians to **obtain an Indian trader license** to engage in
business relations with Indians on a reservation]{.underline}.8 The
license will not be issued until the lease is obtained.89 To obtain a
license, prospective [licensees must prove they are of good moral
character, have business experience, have the capital to invest, and
more]{.underline}.90 The license only applies to a single store, meaning
[an individual must obtain a separate license to open the same exact
enterprise at different coordinates]{.underline} within the same
reservation.91 [In the event a licensee wishes to sell the
business]{.underline} to another person, [the licensee cannot simply
transfer her license]{.underline}.92 Rather, she must get the BIA\'s
approval for the transfer; otherwise, the purchaser of the business must
go through the hassle of getting the license on his own. [Companies
operating without an Indian trader license may be **shut down by the
BIA**]{.underline},94 and [failure to obtain a license places the
enterprise at risk of forfeiture of \"all merchandise offered for sale
to the Indians or found in his possession]{.underline}.\"95

The bureaucracy continues even after a licensed company opens a store in
Indian country. Within Indian country, [businesses cannot engage in
commerce for-or even possess-any item the **U**nited **S**tates has
provided the Indians for their welfare]{.underline}.96 Businesses cannot
even independently set their own prices, as the Code of Federal
Regulations declares:

> It is the duty of the superintendent to see that the prices charged by
> licensed traders are fair and reasonable. To this end the traders
> shall on request submit to the superintendent or inspecting officials
> the original invoice, showing cost, together with a statement of
> transportation charges, retail price of articles sold by them, the
> amount of Indian accounts carried on their books, the total annual
> sales, the value of buildings, livestock owned on reservation, the
> number of employees, and any other business information such officials
> may desire. The quality of all articles kept on sale must be good and
> merchantable.97

[Establishments operated by licensed traders \"must be managed by the
bonded principal\" who is a **habitual resident of the
reservation**]{.underline} where the business is located.98 [The Indian
trader regulations]{.underline} even [limit the methods by which traders
can pay Indians]{.underline}99 [and **grant the President authority to
block goods from entering Indian reservations**]{.underline}.100 Like
the Indian country leasing regulations, [different federal Indian trader
regulations apply to different reservations]{.underline}. 101

[**As with trust land**, whether a person is Indian impacts how Indian
trader laws apply. \"Full blood\" Indians are exempt from]{.underline}
Indian [trader license requirements]{.underline}.10 2 Only individuals
who are not \"pure Indian\" must obtain the license to conduct business
with Indians on a reservation.103 **[Race is an overt factor for
employees of Indian traders]{.underline}** too, as the law states \"
\[t\]hat no white person shall be employed as a clerk by any Indian
trader, except such as trade with said Five Civilized Tribes, unless
first licensed so to do by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under and
in conformity to regulations to be established by the Secretary of the
Interior.\"104 The law does not define \"white person,\" leaving
unanswered: Who is a \"white person\"?105

These [federal regulations make starting a business in Indian country
**much more difficult** than opening a business outside of Indian
country]{.underline}. These **[regulations]{.underline}**0 6
**[needlessly increase transaction costs, adding uncertainty and expense
to Indian country commerce]{.underline}**.107 These regulations-that
apply only to Indian country- are crippling reservation economies.\'
Accordingly, these regulations should be challenged in court as
unconstitutional impediments to tribal economic development. The
following Part examines the unique constitutional position of Indians.

[Although trusteeship enables tribes to preserve their land
base]{.underline} as trust land, generally cannot be seized from
creditors, is immune from state taxation, and income earned on trust
land is exempt from state taxation (Crepelle, 2020), [its more general
consequence is to **add costs to economic activities** in Indian
country]{.underline} (Miller, 2012, 2018). [The trouble]{.underline}
with trust status [is the **complex federal bureaucracy** that encumbers
it]{.underline}, thereby [**reducing Indians' ability to find the most
efficient use of their land** even today]{.underline} (Russ and
Stratmann, 2016). The [IRA]{.underline} established [rules]{.underline}
that continue to [severely restrict alienability of
property]{.underline} (Shoemaker, 2016). [Limited alienability
complicates the mortgage process]{.underline}; in fact, [**mortgaging
trust land requires** the **approval** of the Secretary of the Interior,
increasing the burden on owners to use their land as
collateral]{.underline}.12 [Land held in trust is]{.underline} also
[subject to fractionation, which is a problem of tenancy in
common]{.underline} (with restrictions on alienability) [rather than
incomplete assignment of property rights]{.underline}. Although common
law favors partition or sale when multiple parties inherit the same
parcel, [Section 5 of the Dawes Act required]{.underline} that [heirs
received undivided interests]{.underline} (Sawers, 2009), [resulting in
ownership interests passing down through the generations producing
**ever-smaller ownership interests**]{.underline}. According to the
Supreme Court in Hodel versus Irving (1987), **[Indian trust lands
averaged over 100 co-owners]{.underline}** for each plot of land in some
parts of Indian country. According to the Court, '[Because the land was
held in trust and]{.underline} often [could not be alienated or
partitioned, the fractionation problem grew and grew over time'. The
result is an **anticommons problem: excessive assignment of private
property rights undermines the value of an asset**]{.underline} (Heller,
1998), [even if the parcel itself is a reasonable size]{.underline}
(Shoemaker, 2014). [Fractionation renders Indian property]{.underline},
in de Soto's (2000) terminology, **[dead capital]{.underline}**, though
the problem is not simply in the institutional constraints on particular
parcels of land: [the defects in any]{.underline} given parcel of [land
frustrate the]{.underline} necessarily [coordinative reassembly of
land]{.underline} (Alston and Smith, 2020), as [there is not an easy way
for contracting parties to assemble plots of fee simple as many
reservations]{.underline} within any specific location [have a
combination of fee simple, tribal, and trust land]{.underline}.

#### Lack of co-ownership clarity makes it [more complex]{.underline} and [uncertain]{.underline} than the status quo.

The [trust status itself remains **overly rigid and technical** for
landowners]{.underline}. The [jurisdictional uncertainty between tribal
and federal control, even within trust properties]{.underline} alone,
[is **limiting**]{.underline}. Even worse, [the]{.underline} entire
[buy-back endeavor itself fails to account for]{.underline} the problem
that many of these co-owned lands are actually emulsified\--containing
[mixes of fee and trust co-ownership interests]{.underline}\--and [the
buy-back plan does not include]{.underline} these [undivided fee
interests]{.underline} in some emulsified properties. 211 At best, these
[buy-back efforts result in a **new co-ownership** between fee owners
and a trust]{.underline} on behalf of \[\*522\] the tribe itself. But
**[very few, if any]{.underline}**, consolidation [**efforts in heavily
fractionated trust lands will be complete**, suggesting]{.underline} the
more likely result is [an **even more complicated mix of co-ownership**
among]{.underline} a new three-way mix of [individual trust, tribal
trust, and fee co-owners]{.underline} in something akin to a
\"super-emulsified\" property. 212 [Because]{.underline} each of these
[different tenure statuses is defined and regulated in
different]{.underline}, and often [incongruent, ways]{.underline} by
different jurisdictional authorities, these [property institutions may
be **more difficult to use** than even all-trust fractionated
lands]{.underline}\--meaning [the buy-back effort may **backfire** and
create **more complex and novel land-use problems than originally
perceived**]{.underline}. 213

Similarly, although absolute alienation restraints are rare and often
outright prohibited in standard U.S. property law---at least and
uniquely in the specific context of land---there are exceptions that
shape place relations. This is particularly stark [in]{.underline} the
context of [American Indian trust lands]{.underline} where, in general,
[Native rights of occupancy]{.underline}---whether tribally or
individually owned---[are deemed **inalienable**]{.underline}, and even
[many leases or other use agreements must be approved by a
**bureaucratic system of federal oversight and review**]{.underline}.142
[This unique system]{.underline}---not only of relative inalienability,
but also [in which local tribal governments have limited autonomy to

In popular culture, American Indian [reservations]{.underline} often
[appear as islands of **neglect** and **despair**]{.underline}.1 These
depictions draw from grains of truth, some of them quite devastating.
Last winter on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, for example,
a twelve-year-old girl reportedly attempted suicide because she was
freezing.2 Many Indian reservations are plagued by high rates of
poverty, 3 along with substandard housing, poor health, crime, and other
social ills.4 The problems of Indian poverty and living conditions on
reservations have inspired various explanations. But one account,
advanced by economists and commentators,5 has started to gain traction
and is now seen as part and parcel of an apparent desire to
\"privatize\" Indian lands.6 The argument is that reservation-based
Indians don\'t have \"property rights,\" which, in turn, shackles them
and inhibits their ability to create wealth.7 To address this issue, a
long line of scholarship, led most prominently by Terry Anderson, has
argued for increased individuation and alienability-and diminished
federal responsibility-with respect to tribal lands and resources. 8
While the place of Indian lands seems longstanding, even permanent, in
the United States,9 these calls for modifications to the Indian land
tenure system deserve serious consideration. The issue is particularly
pressing in light of recent, significant changes in the political
leadership in the United States.

Most recently, [Indian lands and resources have become **targets of the
Trump Administration\'s development agenda**]{.underline}. 10 One of the
first moves by the Administration was an attempt, still pending in the
courts, to vastly shrink Bears Ears National Monument.11 Under the Obama
Administration, Bears Ears was set aside in a unique tribal
co-management program to protect the petroglyphs, monuments, and
landscapes that are sacred to the tribes of the region.12 But the
designated area is also rich in natural resources, 13 and as the New
York Times recently revealed, the Trump Administration\'s decision to
diminish the National Monument and its protections for tribal culture
was motivated by a desire to foster oil extraction. 14 Many other
[tribes control]{.underline} similar [lands rich in natural resources
that players in the extractive industries would]{.underline} almost
certainly [like to access with less regulatory oversight]{.underline}.15
With respect to Indian reservations, President Trump\'s acting Assistant
Secretary for Indian Affairs testified in favor of [a controversial bill
that would]{.underline}, upon request of an Indian tribe,
[require]{.underline} the [Interior]{.underline} Department **[to take
reservation land out of trust and put it in \"restricted fee\"
status]{.underline}**.16 More recently, the new Assistant Secretary
issued a decision regarding the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe that \"pave\[d\]
the way for a reservation to be taken out of trust for the first time
since the termination era.\"17

Given that President [Trump has expressed a desire to **privatize
everything**]{.underline} from national parks to air traffic control, 18
and given the unpredictability and volatility of the current political
landscape, it is difficult to know how seriously to take this threat or
how extensive the scope of its impact might be. Yet in light of the
resonance between this political conversation on privatization and the
extensive body of scholarship arguing for more private property rights
in Indian Country, there are important issues worth considering here.
Among other things, [privatization could have **disproportionate impacts
on Indian tribes**, which are already under extreme stress]{.underline},
with conditions only made worse by the recent government shutdown.1 9
Moreover, **[the President has long been on the record criticizing
successful Indian economic development initiatives]{.underline}**.20
Thus, [there is healthy skepticism about whether the advocated
free-market approach to tribal property is based on a genuine concern
for Indians\' wealth or well-being]{.underline}. 21

[In addition to complexity over]{.underline} whether [tribal or state
law applies, the federal government burdens Indian country with
regulations that **apply nowhere else**]{.underline} in the United
States, and [this **undermines tribal lawmaking power**]{.underline}.185
[Trust land is a prime example. The federal government holds the
underlying title]{.underline} to it while an individual Indian or tribe
is the beneficiary.1 86 [Performing **virtually any activity** on trust
land **requires federal approval**]{.underline}, and [it can **take
years for the feds to approve something** as basic as a
lease]{.underline}.187 [The federal government asserts extensive
authority over private businesses]{.underline} operating [on
reservations]{.underline} too, and the [regulations]{.underline} can
[vary whether a person is an Indian or not]{.underline}.188 While tribes
have the authority to establish their own trust land leasing regulations
under the Helping Expedite and Advance Responsible Tribal Home Ownership
Act (HEARTH Act), the federal government requires the tribal leasing
regulations to mimic the federal guidelines.189

Andreas **Østhagen 18**, Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute, Senior
Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Ph.D. in International
Relations from the University of British Columbia, "How Norway and
Russia avoid Conflict over Svalbard," The Arctic Institute, 06-19-2018,
accessed 02-02-2021,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/norway-russia-avoid-conflict-svalbard,
DG

In 1977, Norway established a maritime Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)
around the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. [[Norway avoided]{.mark}
claiming an outright]{.underline} Exclusive Economic Zone
([[EEZ]{.underline}]{.mark}) [fearing it would be challenged due
to]{.underline} stipulations (or lack thereof) concerning extended
maritime zones in [the Svalbard Treaty]{.underline} from 1920.1) A
dispute with Russia over the status of the Zone arose, although the two
countries quickly agreed to disagree as long as Russian fishermen would
have access to fisheries in the Zone.

In the late 1990s, Norwegian fisheries enforcement in the FPZ became
stricter, in tandem with declining fish stocks and fear of considerable
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Barents Sea.
This led the Norwegian Coast Guard to attempt to arrest Russian fishing
vessels on several occasions, resulting in reactions from Russian
fishermen, as well as officials in Murmansk and Moscow.2) In 1998, 2001,
2005, and 2011 specifically, incidents had the potential to escalate
beyond a fisheries issue.

Today, the [[risk of events spiralling]{.mark} out of
control]{.underline} in the FPZ [[remains a]{.mark} primary
[concern]{.mark} for both the Norwegian Coast Guard and]{.underline} the
Norwegian [Ministry of Defence.]{.underline} Echoing these fears, in
2017 the Russian Defence Ministry deemed Svalbard a potential area for
future conflict with Norway, and in consequence NATO.3) Given the
potential volatility of events in the FPZ, how do **[[Norway and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** manage to **[[avoid escalation]{.mark} in
the case of a crisis]{.underline}**? Two intertwining relationships are
integral to answering this.

Interest alignment

First, [**coop**eration **can be the product of discord**]{.underline}.
In other words, states cooperate when they disagree. Sometimes
[[institutions]{.mark} are needed to [overcome]{.mark} the [self-help
tendencies]{.mark} of the international system]{.underline}. Along this
line of argumentation, [cooperation between Norway and Russia
[concerning]{.mark} shared [fish stocks, oil spill response,]{.mark}
search and rescue, and ship traffic management are formalised
arrangements]{.underline} set up [to [manage]{.mark}]{.underline}
potential areas of [[discord]{.underline}]{.mark}. Along the same line
of argumentation, the Barents Sea maritime boundary agreement in 2010
was a result of interests between the two states converging
sufficiently.4)

In other words, **[the reason why [Norway and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** manage to **[[keep]{.mark} crises from
escalating]{.underline}** further **[is [mutual interest in]{.mark}
preserving]{.underline}** aspects of their
[**[coop]{.mark}**eration]{.underline}; cooperation that benefits both
parties. This relates to multiple issue areas. Concerning resource
management, Russia is assumed to be satisfied with the current quota
scheme, in contrast to what might be achieved if an actual debate over
the status of the FPZ took place.5) Concerning the UNCLOS-regime,
[[both]{.mark} parties]{.underline} [[benefit from]{.mark} a [stable
legal regime]{.mark}]{.underline} in the FPZ specifically, but also [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} at large.6) And concerning national
security, [[both]{.underline}]{.mark} parties [[have]{.mark} an
[interest in low levels of conflict for fear of]{.mark} coercive efforts
by [other actors]{.mark} within and outside the Barents/Arctic
region]{.underline}.7)

The interests that drive cooperation might, however, be subject to
change (over time). We can see changes taking place within all the
issue-areas addressed: as climate change continues to alter the marine
resource base in the Barents Sea; as external actors challenge the
validity of the UNCLOS-regime in the Arctic; or as the power relations
between various actors fluctuate. The institutions set up to manage
cooperation are also challenged and questions of institutional
resilience become salient: how will cooperative mechanisms adapt as
conditions influencing the premise for cooperation change?8)

For example, as Norway and Russia struggled to reach agreement on a
reduction of annual quotas for the Barents Sea in the early 2000s,
several institutional measures were taken. In 2002, a harvest control
rule was introduced in the Joint Fisheries Commission to set quotas
according to scientific advice while also limiting fluctuations from
year to year. This has been described as the most important change in
the work of the Commission, removing a source of friction between the
two states (which had spill-over effects into the FPZ).9)

Talking to your neighbour

Second, [as emphasised by officials in the Norwegian Coast
Guard]{.underline}, former Coast Guard officers, [and]{.underline}
multiple [scholarly works]{.underline} written on the management of
shared fish stocks in the Barents Sea, **[[personal contact between
individuals constitute]{.mark} a [core]{.mark} element [of conflict
management]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Barents Sea. [The importance of
[dialogue]{.mark} during a crisis is given]{.underline} much [credit for
**[solv]{.mark}**ing [incidents between the Norwegian Coast Guard and
**Russia**]{.mark}n fishing vessels]{.underline}. This includes
communication between the Coast Guard and Russian trawlers (including
the use of Russian interpreters); between the Norwegian Joint Military
Headquarters and the Chief of the Russian Northern Fleet at Severomorsk;
and between the negotiating groups in the Joint Fisheries Commission.

[Having various means of communicating, and keeping channels
open]{.underline} as a crisis is unfolding, [constitute central elements
in the management of conflict]{.underline} in the FPZ. This can be
linked to the notion of 'track two diplomacy', albeit without an
immediate large-scale international crisis as an impetus. Still,
**[[instilling]{.mark} so called low-level or '[soft'
dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}** in addition **[[to]{.mark} other more
[formal]{.mark} [channels]{.mark}]{.underline}** of communication,
**[have]{.underline}** -- in this case -- **[[provided]{.mark} an
[effective]{.mark} approach to [conflict
management]{.mark}]{.underline}**.10)

This concerns the larger concept of personal relations, as social
contact between two or more individuals representing different sides in
a dispute. The theory of socialisation emphasises not only the
communication component, but also the fact that a change occurs between
the parties. Norms (expected behaviour) socialise (change) actors
according to a logic of appropriateness.11) [[By interacting]{.mark}
regularly [with the same individuals on the same
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} (fisheries, quotas, inspections) [over time,
[mutual understanding emerges as]{.mark} the
[individuals]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves [better [comprehend the
position of the other]{.mark} party.]{.underline}

Maintaining low tension

[[Personal relations]{.underline}]{.mark} have [formed]{.underline} the
basis for the [institutionalisation of]{.underline} some of the
[mechanisms]{.underline} described above, [that [enable
**coop**]{.mark}eration between Norway and Russia]{.underline} in this
specific instance. Examples include the exchange of coast guard officers
from Norway and Russia, as well as the formalised sharing of information
and annual meetings between the Chiefs of the coast guards. This
institutionalisation and its relevance for the issues at hand in the
Barents Sea at large, and the FPZ specifically, played a central part in
sheltering the coast guard cooperation from sanctions and restrictions
put in place between Norway and Russia in 2014.12) **[[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus [**[a feedback loop]{.mark} taking place
[between institutionalisation and personal
interaction]{.mark}**s**.**]{.underline}

This article does not attempt to outline a monocausal explanation for
success in maritime dispute management. Instead, the aim is to showcase
how [multiple explanations]{.underline} [emphasising different aspects
of conflict relations contribute to the outcome]{.underline}. In sum,
several factors concerning the dispute in the Svalbard Zone help explain
why it has been managed adequately in the context of a larger quarrel.

Looking ahead, [the writing on the wall is relatively clear: to maintain
low tension in the zone around Svalbard, [Norway and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} need both be aware of the factors that
[[keep]{.mark} their [relations civil]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Upholding dialogue between the two countries' coast guards regardless of
fluctuating international relations is crucial. So is establishing and
re-developing cooperative mechanisms such as the Joint Fisheries
Commission, as the resource situation in Arctic waters might change.

#### No draw-in.

Sharing a risk in this context [by calling on a military
alliance]{.underline} -- a strategy more usually reserved for unlikely
but very harmful risks, would be a potential solution. The NATO alliance
would be a classic example of such a risk management device. However,
[a]{.underline} potentially [[significant issue]{.mark} associated
[with]{.mark} a massive criminal affront to Norwegian sovereignty
in]{.underline} the [[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} FPZ, [[is that **it
may be regarded as**]{.mark} **[too small]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or
domestic) **[a problem [to trigger]{.mark}]{.underline}** NATO support
under **[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic Treaty
(1949). Moreover, [[not all NATO nations agree with Norway's
**interp**]{.mark}retation [of the]{.mark} [Svalbard
Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the use of violence by IUU fishermen
may not be viewed as an armed attack per se on Norway. Even if IUU
incidents developed into a fish war, with a states party sending armed
vessels to support the right of its nationals to fish the FPZ (see the
scenario example below), [the [wording]{.mark} of the treaty [does not
commit]{.mark} its signatories]{.underline} necessarily [[to meet armed
force with armed force]{.underline}]{.mark}.45 Article 11 notes that:
"...the Treaty shall be ratified and its provisions carried out by the
Parties in accordance with their respective constitutional processes."
The [**[action 'deemed necessary]{.underline}**']{.mark} under Article 5
in response to an armed attack **[[is]{.mark} [subject to
consideration]{.mark} both [by]{.mark} national governments and between
[NATO representatives.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Dialogue prevails.

http://dx.doi.org/10.22459/GA.06.2017.07, DG

Whereas the end of the Cold War implied that 'for most other states than
Russia the region has remained either marginal or peripheral', the
[[importance of the High North]{.underline} [was
revitalised]{.underline}]{.mark} [in Norway]{.underline} with the
Norwegian High North strategy from 2005 onwards.73 The [significant
Russian military build-up]{.underline} on the Kola Peninsula from the
mid-2000s also [raised concerns]{.underline} about security among
Norwegian politicians, diplomats and militaries. In particular, the
Russian reopening of old military bases, the increased level of military
exercises and, not least, the increase in overflights of Russian bombers
and strategic bombers off the coast of Norway sparked a new round of
'New Cold War' rhetoric and media headlines.

[Certainly, a more aggressive Russian foreign policy]{.underline}
towards Eastern Europe and Ukraine in 2014 in particular
[has]{.underline} also [put the High North]{.underline}, where Russia
has 'geo-political and military-strategic interests', [back at the top
of the Norwegian security and defence policy agenda]{.underline}.74 For
instance, the main focus of the expert commission was the security
challenges that Russia represents in the region, which they describe as
'an arena for geopolitical struggle'.75 The forward-leaning Russian
foreign policy has also gained a lot of attention in Nordic academic
environments.76 [Even after]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}
crisis, however, **[[Russia has not been]{.mark} [considered]{.mark} as
[a]{.mark} direct [threat to Norway]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least not
at present.77 As formulated by the head of Norwegian military
intelligence, 'Russia has not suddenly become a military threat---not in
the short term. But, in the long term the picture is more uncertain'.78
Hence the focus on strengthening the military presence in northern
Norway in subsequent defence plans and reports.79 [Rather than seeing
any impending security threats]{.underline} in the region, the Norwegian
Ministry of Foreign Affair's Arctic slogan, '[high north, low tension',
emphasises the safety aspect of Arctic activity.]{.underline}

All of the peacetime, **[[cooperative]{.mark} military bilateral and
multilateral [arrangements]{.mark} in the Arctic [are between]{.mark}
the nation [states]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the region. For instance,
the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, signed by the five Arctic coastal
states, established a common framework for maritime sovereignty in the
Arctic Ocean. All [[signatories]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[agreed]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[claims and disputes
are]{.underline}]{.mark} to be [[negotiated]{.mark} between the Arctic
coastal states to [prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} of political disagreements into
security issues. [[Norway and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, who have had
overlapping claims in the Barents Sea for decades, finally [managed to
conclude negotiations and [sign an agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2010.

The role of NATO in the region has been brought up from time to time.
[**[NATO is not]{.underline}**,]{.mark} however, **[[likely to
increase]{.mark} its [activity]{.mark} in the Arctic in peacetime
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** instead [**[encourages]{.mark} the
continuation of the [coop]{.mark}**eration **between**]{.underline} all
of the **[Arctic states]{.underline}**. The [[defence
establishments]{.mark} of the Arctic states [promote]{.mark}
peacetime]{.underline} [[confidence-building]{.underline}]{.mark}
measures.80 [There are regular]{.underline} bilateral and multilateral
[[military exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [that [include
Russia and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [individual [NATO]{.mark}
members]{.underline} among the Arctic states. There are annual informal
meetings between military leaders from all of the Arctic states where
'soft security' measures and military support to civilian agencies
responsible for safety-related matters are discussed. [These matters
have become increasingly important]{.underline} with growing levels of
human activity in the Arctic Ocean. This emphasis on safety capabilities
corresponds with recent efforts under the auspices of the Arctic Council
that resulted in a new search and rescue agreement (2011) and an
oil-spill preparedness and response agreement (2013).

The requirement for monitoring and safety arrangements depends on the
volume and scope of future civilian activities. The Arctic may be a
promising area for commercial opportunities. There is a potential for
shorter transcontinental maritime transit though the Northern Sea Route,
increasing the profit and value of extraction of onshore and offshore
petroleum and mineral resources. Analysts, however, have recently
addressed several factors dampening the most optimistic future
predictions. Operations in the Arctic environment can be complex,
difficult (extremely low temperatures and icing contribute to this) and
costly. Profitability of commercial ventures in the Arctic may also be
influenced by the dynamics in the market itself and evolving concepts
for production and distribution.

[The [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}---where Norway has invested
significant political and economic capital---[can be [seen as a unique
arena for]{.mark} the country]{.underline} as a place [where
[Norway]{.mark} meets and interacts with many non-Arctic
states]{.underline}. Meeting both Arctic and non-Arctic partners in the
High North has been a priority for Norway. For instance, the rapidly
growing economies of Asia have expressed a particular interest in the
Arctic, which has coincided with Norway's recognition of Asia as an
increasingly important arena for Norwegian foreign policy.81 Similar to
its other Nordic regional partners, [Norway has been [forthcoming and
welcoming of Asian states']{.mark} Arctic interests]{.underline}, as
**[it [encourages]{.mark} broad [dialogue on]{.mark}]{.underline}**
issues affecting **[the Arctic and competence
[sharing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Norway welcomes the diverse opinions,
complementary expertise and outside-of-the-Arctic thinking that
non-Arctic states can provide. Norway has developed especially close
bilateral ties on Arctic issues with Singapore, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea has prioritised Norway as a cooperation partner in Arctic
and regular bilateral interactions between Norway and Singapore and
Norway and South Korea have also strengthened collaborative commitments
and interest in the region.82 Norway proclaimed its support of the Asian
states' inclusion in the Arctic Council in early 2013 and continued to
play a role in the states' ultimate acceptance and inclusion in the
council's ministerial meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, in May 2013. This
[[receptive attitude]{.underline}]{.mark} [towards]{.underline} the
[Asian states can be]{.underline} in part [[explained by]{.mark} a
Norwegian interest in revitalising [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}.83 [Given its geographic placement and
record in the High North,]{.underline} [[Norway can play a]{.mark}
significant [role as a gatekeeper and facilitator of non-Arctic states'
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, [[which]{.mark} can in
turn [have positive offshoots in]{.mark} other bilateral, regional and
[international settings.]{.mark}84]{.underline}

### No Norway Middle Power\-\--2AC

#### NATO can't be a middle power\-\--they're too close to Russia to lead on any other issue. 

Nina **Græger 19**, Senior Research Fellow at the Norwegian Institute of
International Affairs, Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of
Oslo, "Illiberalism, geopolitics, and middle power security: Lessons
from the Norwegian case," International Journal. Vol. 74, No. 1, 2019,
accessed 07-28-2025, https://doi.org/10.1177/0020702019834982, DG

How do the revival of geopolitical reasoning and illiberalism
potentially affect NATO's value as a framework for shelter? [NATO, as
well as other]{.underline} multilateral [frameworks]{.underline} that
[middle powers]{.underline} have come to [rely on]{.underline} for
security, **[depend on]{.underline}** the engagement and backing from
[**great powers** to be attractive and efficient]{.underline}. The US is
the biggest contributor to NATO, and the credibility of the alliance is
largely based on US military contributions, engagement, and leadership.
In NATO, a lack of American leadership has, however, been visible for
some time. [The US]{.underline} ''[back seat]{.underline}''
[position]{.underline}, which became particularly visible prior to the
Libya operation ''Unified Protector'' in 2011, [has been accentuated by
Trump's speeches and tweets]{.underline} about NATO's lack of relevance
and harsh critique of Europe's military deficit in NATO. While this
critique is not new, when combined with Trump's political project, it
has cast the US military guarantee behind Article 5 into doubt. Beyond
its importance for the security of the other NATO members, this also
questions NATO's role as the constitution of the Western security
community. 36 Another trend that points in the same direction is the
internal North--South divide in NATO concerning what the most pressing
threats are (e.g. illegal immigration and organized crime versus Russian
expansion) and how to spend NATO resources to meet them.

Despite [these developments]{.underline}, which [are particularly
**worrisome for a middle power like Norway**]{.underline}, if we look at
what NATO is doing, there has, nevertheless, been a strengthening of
joint efforts to reassure its members that aggression against any NATO
member will not be tolerated. Since the Wales Summit in September 2014,
a territorial ''turn'' has defined alliance policies, strategies, and
outlook.37 This is most notably reflected in the ongoing realization of
NATO's missile defence, the organization of regular allied exercises and
presence in eastern and northern Europe. A number of small and middle
powers like Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Norway, Slovakia, and
Iceland are contributing to NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence in the
Baltic states and Poland.38 Norway has welcomed the return to national,
territorial defence and NATO's renewed focus on Russia, at the expense
of international operations afar, as signalled already in its 2008 Core
Area Initiative.39

However, [for Norway and other middle powers, implementing NATO's
reassurance policy **may come at a cost**. Insofar as the
Norwegian--Russian relationship]{.underline} also [mirrors the
NATO--Russia relationship, being a neighbour to]{.underline} an
increasingly assertive [Russia **renders Norway more vulnerable** to
external pressures]{.underline}. In 2018, the Norwegian government
proposed to double the number of US troops on Norwegian soil and hosted
the largest NATO exercise (Trident Juncture) in the last decade. While
both practices have been in place since the Cold War, [Russian
authorities have]{.underline} on several occasions [claimed]{.underline}
that [enhanced allied military activities close to]{.underline} or
within [the Russian]{.underline} ''[sphere of influence]{.underline}''
[challenge the power balance]{.underline}. 40 Also, Norwegian analysts
have maintained that the stepping up of US presence in Norway may
reduce, rather than increase, Norway's security. 41 While no adjustments
in Norwegian security policy are expected any time soon, [the revival of
realist geopolitics may]{.underline}, over time, [**constrain Norway's
sheltering strategies** with NATO]{.underline}.

develop robust and resilient cable designs that can withstand Arctic
conditions, including ice, extreme cold, and shifting icebergs. [Use

In recent days, President [Trump and his administration have released a
**radical** new geopolitical strategy, one in which the White House
seems to be **turning** against traditional European allies and building
**closer ties** to Vladimir Putin's Russia]{.underline}. It appears that
part of this interest in building closer links to Russia, including by
disdaining Ukraine, blaming the war on Ukraine (Russia invaded Ukraine),
and [Trump himself lavishly praising Putin, is the idea that the United
States can **use Russia** alongside Washington as a tool together
against China]{.underline}. In some ways, this would [vaguely
**resemble** a reverse Kissinger]{.underline}---Henry Kissinger and
Richard Nixon had [courted China]{.underline}, which was already
[splitting]{.underline} with the [Soviet Union]{.underline}, to build a
U.S.-China front against Moscow. Here, the White House and its China
super hawks seem to believe that they can work with Russia to isolate
China from the world and damage its increasing global presence.

One can debate whether this radical shift, besides the wisdom of
disdaining longtime U.S. allies and throwing a high amount of
uncertainty into global politics, would work against China, or if it
makes any sense at all in promoting U.S. interests and U.S. leadership.
China and Russia already have been building very close strategic and
economic links, and the two are allied in trying to reduce the dominance
of the dollar as a reserve currency and prime currency of trade, promote
alternative institutions to the post-WWII order, and back up a growing
network of linked authoritarian states around the world, from Venezuela
to Vietnam.

In many respects, given China's extreme closeness with Russia and the
fact that China has insulated itself well against U.S. tariffs, trade
pressure, and other types of pressure, China is better positioned to
ally with Russia in a more formal way against the United States.

However, were the Trump administration's plan to make some inroads[,
Russia's historical and current-day relations with South and Southeast
Asian states might help. If U.S. cooperation with Russia **blunts some
of China's global gains** and possibly challenges China more intensely
in its home region, since Washington would **not have to worry** about
spending money protecting itself against Moscow, then theoretically the
United States would have more money to support partners in Asia opposed
to China]{.underline}.

[Russia also has historic close ties with many South and Southeast Asian
states, some of which continue to this day]{.underline}---and might be a
help if the Trump administration is trying to use Russia and the United
States together to isolate China. Perhaps the [added Russia links could
**bolster** stronger resistance to China in parts of South and Southeast
Asia, where some countries fear China's security
aggressiveness]{.underline} even as they build massive trade links with
Beijing.

For instance, the Soviet Union was a major supporter of North Vietnam in
the Vietnam War, and the Vietnamese army to this day is mostly reliant
on Russian platforms and Russian equipment. The Vietnamese leadership,
too, still has close diplomatic relations with Russia and did not
condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Perhaps the addition of
Russia to U.S. pressure on Vietnam might push the Vietnamese leadership
to more clearly move away from China.

And, [Russia's ties to India have lasted some seventy-five years,
including deep bilateral economic ties that are increasing rapidly in
recent years]{.underline}. India continued to buy Russian oil despite
sanctions and has mapped out a plan with Russia to increase bilateral
trade by tens of billions of dollars in the next few years. [With India
already at odds with China on so many issues, maybe the addition of
Russia to the growing U.S.-India partnership would **help turn India**
more clearly against Beijing]{.underline}. (There are other examples,
too, of South and Southeast Asian states with longstanding diplomatic,
military, and economic links to Russia.)

#### US-Russia coop spillsover to climate arms control and Middle East

**Devyatkin 25** \[Pavel Devyatkin, senior associate at the Arctic
Institute (Washington, DC) and a PhD fellow and lecturer at HSE

US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia and the [Trump-Putin phone call signal a
**possible** negotiation]{.underline} for peace in Ukraine and new
opportunities for the countries' relations, including [in the Arctic
region]{.underline}.

The Arctic, warming four times faster than the rest of the world, may be
[the **key region** for the US and Russia to advance cooperation.
US-Russia rapprochement may **broadly benefit** the world by bringing an
end to the disastrous war in Ukraine and reducing the risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}, but existential environmental issues still demand
attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We [need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic]{.underline}." The
[**Arctic region makes sense** as a setting for cooperation]{.underline}
as the two sides have explicitly expressed interest in exploring
cooperation in energy, investment, and geopolitical issues. [Western
sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to **step up its cooperation** in
the Arctic with China]{.underline} in joint energy ventures and grand
plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now see [Arctic cooperation as a
**potential means to "drive a wedge**" between Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}.

In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian diplomats and
businessmen over the past few weeks[, it is clear that **many are
interested** in diverse forms of Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, from
cultural diplomacy that celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous
peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait, to scientific diplomacy to
understand and [adapt to climate hazards faced by both
nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced [plan to revamp diplomatic relations and **restore** the
staff of the countries' diplomatic missions will **significantly
reduce** the current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in
the Arctic]{.underline}. By making it easier to issue visas and travel
between the two countries, Americans and Russians will again be able to
[conduct joint research, expeditions, and scientific conferences and
build models to better understand the unfolding climate
emergency]{.underline}. Scientific cooperation to understand the changes
[affecting sea ice, **permafrost**, ecosystems,]{.underline} and local
communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war in
Ukraine.

[Cooperation in the Arctic can help **build regional
stability**]{.underline}. More importantly, A[rctic cooperation will
build trust between the US and Russia that could complement or **spill
over into other crucial fields** of cooperation such as arms control,
Middle East peace, and global health]{.underline}.

The military [cooperation between China and Russia around the
Arctic]{.underline} has appeared to [intensify in recent years, but a
deepening relationship comes with complexities for the two countries,
potentially preventing substantial collaborations]{.underline} that are
not just for show, according to a report released July 8 by the Center
for European Policy Analysis.

[Beijing and Moscow have been holding joint exercises and flyovers at
the fringe of the Arctic]{.underline}, and the two nations also possess
the [ability and willingness to cooperatively sabotage critical undersea
infrastructure, threatening U.S. and NATO interests]{.underline}, said
the report, "Sino-Russian Cooperation in the Arctic."

The report described circumpolar security as "an area where Russian-Sino
relations are a threat multiplier against U.S. and NATO interests."

Mathieu Boulègue, the report\'s author and a senior fellow with the
Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for European
Policy Analysis, said: "The whole point of this report is really to try
to ring the alarm bell that we need to do something about this
cooperation, but that we need to keep a cool head as well."

"As it is, Russia-China relations in general are defined equally by
their positive points --- deeper cooperation on one hand --- but also by
their friction points, the negative points," Boulègue said in an
interview.

[China is seeking greater access to the Arctic region]{.underline} ---
[for its transit routes, resources such as fish and access to the
Russian coastline for oil, gas and critical mineral mining]{.underline}
--- but that [access is "only on Russia's terms]{.underline}," Boulègue
said. Meanwhile, Russia has [little to gain militarily from permitting
Chinese access]{.underline} "apart from displaying friendship and
showing that they're not alone and they're not isolated," he said.

While there have recently been indicators of allyship, it is [crucial to
"go beyond the label of cooperation]{.underline}," looking at whether
there is substance, Boulègue said.

[China and Russia are in a phase of "high distrust]{.underline}" with
each other, especially in the military sphere, [but "they can still play
the cooperation card because it fits their interest in the short
term]{.underline}," Boulègue said.

Joint aviation patrols and strategic bomber flights have occurred since
2019 over the East China Sea and Sea of Japan --- close to Japanese and
South Korean air defense identification zones. These flyovers have often
led to airspace violations and incursions over Japan and South Korea.

And although it did not violate U.S. airspace, Moscow and Beijing held
their first joint strategic bomber patrol near the Alaskan air defense
identification zone in July 2024, the report noted.

On the maritime front, the two nations also complete drills and patrols
in the North Pacific Ocean, not far from Arctic waters. For example,
Russian and Chinese warships sail near the Aleutian Islands by Alaska,
"off the U.S. exclusive economic zone in the Bering Sea, during a highly
visible yearly joint exercise focusing on naval coordination and
anti-submarine warfare," the report said.

In April 2023, the [Russian Federal Security Service Border Service and
the Chinese Coast Guard signed a memorandum of understanding "to
strengthen soft security cooperation in maritime law
enforcement]{.underline}," aiming to collaboratively prevent illegal
migration, smuggling, fishing and terrorism, the report said. The
agreement is not Arctic-specific, but it [resulted in the first joint
coast guard exercise in the Russian Arctic]{.underline} in September
2024.

"Such an agreement could [represent a blueprint for future cooperation
in military affairs between the Russian Pacific Fleet and China's
People's Liberation Army Navy]{.underline}," the report said.

Looking ahead, it is likely that China and Russia will soon organize
another joint military drill in the Bering Sea or the Chukchi Sea ---
which are located side-by-side in the Northern Pacific Ocean and the
Arctic Ocean, respectively --- representing "a major symbolic win for
both countries," drawing international attention and proving that China
is capable of sustaining a naval force in the region, the report said.

However, Boulègue noted that [all these events are "joint" --- not
integrated]{.underline}.

"What [really matters from a military perspective and a defense
perspective is the integration into a single, unified military command,
into a form of military reciprocity]{.underline}," Boulègue said. "We
see rounds in the water with boats. We see overflights. But we don\'t
really see integration."

Beyond coordinated drills, "the [disruption of critical undersea
infrastructure and seabed warfare activities]{.underline} represents
another form of nefarious [relations that Russia and China might further
in the Arctic]{.underline}," the report said.

Disrupting critical undersea infrastructure --- such as energy pipelines
and fiber optic communication cables --- is a low-cost strategy with a
high-impact effect on U.S. and NATO interests, "especially in case of
regional escalation," the report said. Additionally, the Arctic region
is particularly vulnerable to these types of infrastructure attacks due
to "chokepoints" such as the Bering Strait where redundancy and
resilience are lacking.

[China and Russia both possess the ability to gather intelligence and
sabotage infrastructure, and both have a track record of doing so
previously]{.underline}, the report noted.

For example, an incident in October 2023 "undoubtedly showed signs of
collusion between Russia and China in \[critical undersea
infrastructure\] disruption" when the Balticconnector gas pipeline and
several fiber optic cables between Estonia, Finland and Sweden were
affected by manmade activity. The police investigation attributed the
damage to a Chinese ship, which --- upon fleeing the Baltic Sea --- was
given permission and escort to cross Russia's Northern Sea Route, the
report said.

In light of China and Russia's increased cooperation, the United States
and its allies should work on being "a bit more present with eyes and
ears" in the Arctic, using intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities to deepen their understanding of how to operate militarily
in that environment, Boulègue said.

"Once we know more, we'll be able to push back effectively against the
messaging of cooperation," Boulègue said.

At the end of the day, [Russia portrays itself "as the gatekeeper to
China's access to Arctic waters]{.underline}" and [does not want to see
a greater presence of China's armed forces in the region, leaving
Beijing cautious to conduct independent military activity in the
region,]{.underline} the report said.

But if [Beijing becomes more active]{.underline} "in shaping future
Arctic governance" by continuing to push "for its vision of a first
come, first served 'global commons' tailored to Chinese economic
interests," [tensions are likely to intensify with Moscow]{.underline},
the report said.

"Ultimately, both countries are voluntarily choosing to ignore existing
friction points, for fear that addressing them would sour the
relationship in the Arctic," the report said. "However, [the situation
does not bode well for the future and will likely preclude further
cooperation]{.underline}."

#### Russia is becoming increasing reliant on China\-\--That allows China to stabilize the RCA

[Despite the growth of a Russian-Sino military-technical partnership,
several constraints have emerged since 2022]{.underline}, driven by
evolving international dynamics, political priorities, and economic
pressures. As a result, despite the rapid expansion of the two
countries' defense collaboration, the relationship between [Moscow and
Beijing remains far from a formal alliance]{.underline}. China, with its
[long-standing commitment to a foreign policy rooted in self-interest,
has historically avoided binding security commitments]{.underline}.
Unlike traditional Western-led military alliances, which come with
mutual defense obligations, [Beijing has maintained a policy of
flexibility, ensuring that its engagement with Russia does not tie it
down to any obligations that could compromise its strategic
autonomy]{.underline}.

One of the most significant limitations stems from their differing
geopolitical objectives. [While both countries share a desire to
challenge Western influence, their primary strategic concerns diverge.
For Russia, the focus remains on countering NATO's presence and
influence, particularly in its immediate neighborhood, such as Ukraine
and the rest of the post-Soviet space. In contrast, China's main
interest lies in its regional ambitions, particularly in East Asia,
including issues surrounding Taiwan, the South China Sea, and its
broader global ambitions, especially in Africa and the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. These differing priorities limit the scope of
their military cooperation outside their respective spheres of
influence, as neither country is willing to fully subordinate its
interests to the other. A clear manifestation of this limitation is that
neither Russia nor China has voiced explicit support for the other's
territorial ambitions.22 [Noteworthy is that China did not recognize the
illegal annexation of either the Crimean Peninsula or the Ukrainian
regions occupied since 2014 or since 2022]{.underline}; on the contrary,
China's conflict settlement plan published in 2023 stands clearly for
the territorial integrity of all states.23

Another crucial limitation is [China's historical reluctance to enter
into formal military alliances, a stance that has been reinforced since
2022]{.underline}. China's official foreign policy is based on the
principle of [noninterference and the avoidance of entangling
commitments that could lead to conflicts with other powers, particularly
the United States or NATO]{.underline}. While, as demonstrated by
territorial conflicts vis-à-vis the Philippines on the South China Sea,
the principle of noninterference is evidently not applied against some
of China's neighbors; [Beijing is still reluctant to openly confront
Washington]{.underline}.24 Hence, altho[ugh China continues to provide
Russia with political and diplomatic support, it remains cautious about
directly supporting Russia's military actions in Ukraine]{.underline} or
committing to any formal security arrangements, though Russia would
clearly be in favor of an agreement that obligates Beijing to aid in
Moscow's war effort in Ukraine. This avoidance of binding military
commitments ensures that while the two countries may collaborate on
military technology and engage in joint military exercises, China's
participation remains measured and does not extend to active military
involvement in Russia's conflicts. A [strong indication of the lack of
any deeper commitment is the sheer fact that China did not provide
Russia with military assistance by sending troops following the start of
the full-scale invasion]{.underline}.5

The Chinese soldiers captured by Ukraine in April 2025 were not part of
any organized Chinese contingent sent to fight alongside Russia, similar
to the units deployed by North Korea. Instead, the two Chinese citizens
were individuals who had joined the Russian army as mercenaries, hoping
to earn better salaries and Russian citizenship.25 As of early 2025,
there had been citizens of more than 50 nations documented fighting in
the ranks of the Russian army, ranging from those from Central Asia to
South America and from the Middle East to Africa. Many joined
voluntarily, including the two captured Chinese; others less so. The
latter category includes most labor migrants coerced into signing up for
the Russian army --- the possibility of contracted military service for
foreigners was opened in autumn 2022. While according to Ukraine, there
are more Chinese individuals serving in the Russian army, there is no
indication that they are there as part of any organized Chinese military
deployment.

Additionally, the [imposition of international sanctions on Russia has
complicated the military-technical partnership]{.underline}. Following
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the West, including the United
States and the European Union, imposed stringent economic sanctions on
Moscow. These [sanctions target critical sectors, including defense
technologies and military hardware]{.underline}. [Although China has not
joined these sanctions, it faces its own set of technological
constraints]{.underline}. While [Chinese companies continue to benefit
from Russian military technology]{.underline}, particularly in the
fields of air defense and aircraft, the sanctions [regime restricts the
transfer of cutting-edge technologies that could be critical for both
nations' military advancements]{.underline}. For the same reason, [China
is not providing Russia with what Moscow would need the most for its war
against Ukraine: heavy weaponry, armored vehicles, and artillery
ammunition]{.underline}. Furthermore, China's own technological and
economic policies discourage it from relying too heavily on Russian
military. equipment as it seeks to advance its indigenous defense
capabilities26

Moreover, [while Russia and China have engaged in joint military
exercises, these activities have been limited in scale and
scope]{.underline}. Their exercises, such as the annual Vostok 2022 in
the east of Russia and Joint Sea 2024 drills, are valuable in
demonstrating military cooperation, but they [do not translate into
deep, operational military integration]{.underline}. The [Chinese and
Russian militaries have not exercised combined arms operations, nor have
they rehearsed command-and-control tasks]{.underline}. The countries
maintain [significant differences in their military doctrines, command
structures, and operational priorities, limiting the potential for joint
action in combat scenarios]{.underline}. China, in particular, is
cautious about being associated too closely with Russia in military
engagements, especially in conflict zones where its own strategic
interests could be jeopardized.

Thus, while Russia and China's military cooperation has grown over the
years, particularly in the post-2022 era, [several limitations hinder
the depth and breadth of their partnership]{.underline}. These
constraints are rooted in divergent geopolitical goals, China's
reluctance to formalize military alliances, economic sanctions, and
technological challenges, and the complexity of coordinating military
actions between two large and strategically different nations. As a
result, their military collaboration, though significant, remains
carefully managed and circumscribed by each nation's broader strategic
interests and concerns, including the [mutual lack of trust and
reluctance to take up binding commitments for each other's
sake]{.underline}. An indicative sign is that there is [no mutual
military assistance or defense pledge in place between the two
countries]{.underline}.

[Within China's political elite, there exists a general wariness toward
Vladimir Putin's leadership style]{.underline}, with some [viewing his
confrontational approach as a destabilizing force]{.underline} on the
world stage. Therefore, [while China continues to leverage its
partnership with Russia to achieve its own objectives, it does so on its
own terms]{.underline}, ensuring that its national interests remain
paramount. A demonstrative example is how China is trying to manage the
US sanctions introduced against Russia's energy sector. To avoid
European sanctions, Chinese companies downgraded their participation in
developing Russia's Arctic-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal
project in May 2022. Gradually tightening US sanctions further hampered
the construction in 2024.27 Recently, following a new round of US
sanctions against the Russian energy sector introduced on January 10,
2025, the Arctic-2 LNG project is highly unlikely to be completed, as
China is reluctant to deliver the necessary components as it wants to
avoid tougher restrictive measures.28

This [poses the evident risk for Moscow that its growing dependence on
China in economic, military, and military-technical spheres could
eventually shift the internal dynamics of their
partnership]{.underline}. As [Beijing's leverage over Moscow increases,
China may play a more dominant role in shaping the strategic direction
of their cooperation]{.underline}. Some elements of this asymmetry are
already visible. While Russia, which is increasingly [dependent on
military cooperation with China, is eager to help Beijing satisfy its
security goals]{.underline}, it is not receiving reciprocal assistance
from China to enhance its own military capabilities to the extent
necessary for achieving any breakthrough in Ukraine.22

#### No RCA in the Arctic\-\--it's an area of weakness

**Dagaev 25** \[Andrei Dagaev, PhD student at the National Chengchi
University (Taipei) \"The Arctic Is Testing the Limits of the
Sino-Russian Partnership\", 2-18-2025,

Over the past three years, Russia's cooperation with China has reached
unprecedented levels. Still, there is [one area where the two countries
have been unable to find common ground: the Arctic]{.underline}. Even in
the current geopolitical climate, the differences between [Moscow and
Beijing's approaches to the Arctic have so far proven too great to
overcome, limiting China's advances in the Far North]{.underline}.

[Publicly, Russia and China maintain they have a "comprehensive
strategic partnership," which ostensibly extends to Arctic
issues]{.underline}. Yet their interests in the region can be quite
disparate.

China first took a serious interest in the Far North in the early 2010s,
initially seeking a seat on the Arctic Council, the region's most
important multilateral organization. Russia did not immediately agree to
admit China, setting two conditions: that China respect the sovereignty
of regional powers and abide by freedom-of-navigation rules. In 2013,
China was finally granted observer status, and with it, a platform to
articulate its regional objectives.

In 2018, China's State Council published the country's first-ever white
paper on Arctic policy. The document described China as a "near-Arctic
state" with a vested interest in the region's affairs. It argued that
the Arctic belonged to all mankind, and so China had the right to enter
its waters and airspace, just like other "constructive" parties.

The [Arctic was easily integrated into China's global Belt and Road
Initiative---in the form of a proposed "Polar Silk
Road]{.underline}"---and its vision of a "Community of Common Destiny."
Overall, it [presented Beijing with an opportunity to burnish its image
as a responsible great power]{.underline}.

China's stated objectives in the Arctic have not changed significantly
since 2018. It remains committed to conducting scientific research,
conserving the region, carrying out commercial activities, and assisting
with the Arctic's joint management in line with international law.

Indeed, all of China's statements and documents on the region reiterate
its willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation for the benefit of
the Arctic. Meanwhile, the military-political dimension always goes
unmentioned, with neither the 2018 white paper nor any subsequent
pronouncements hinting at the expansionist designs about which then U.S.
secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned in 2019.

[Russia's Arctic policy is based on altogether different principles. For
Moscow, it is all about unlocking the region's economic potential and
defending sovereignty]{.underline}. Essentially, Russia wishes to
commercialize the region---with an emphasis on oil and gas exploration
and the creation of a transportation corridor---and militarize it, too.

Furthermore[, Russia would do this unilaterally, all references to
dialogue and cooperation with regional partners having been removed from
the country's main documents on the Arctic amid the breakdown in its
relations with the West]{.underline}.

Unlike Beijing, Moscow has put great stock in national projects with
limited foreign participation. Tellingly, [the Northern Sea Route is
treated by the Kremlin as a domestic transport route. While China
welcomes the internationalization of the Arctic's transportation
corridors, Russia has resisted this trend in favor of
autarky]{.underline}.

This fundamental disagreement has long hampered Russia's cooperation
with China on Arctic issues in every area except oil and gas. In the
2010s, [the two countries actively collaborated on oil and gas projects
in the Arctic, many of which the Chinese financed, much to Russia's
gratitude, particularly after the West imposed the first sanctions
against it in 2014]{.underline}.

However, this [partnership could not be extended to other areas of
cooperation]{.underline}. Take infrastructure: in 2016, the state-owned
China Poly Group signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Arkhangelsk region administration on the construction of a deep-sea port
in Arkhangelsk. China was expected to invest \$78 million in the project
and connect the port with the proposed Belkomur railway line. But the
project never transpired.

[Working together on infrastructure is difficult when Russia sees every
new project through a national lens while China views it as a building
block in a Polar Silk Road, an initiative Russia cannot help but be wary
of in its multilateralism]{.underline}.

[Russia's break with the West and increased economic dependence on China
has not smoothed over these tensions, even after repeated commitments by
Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping to strengthen cooperation in the Arctic,
and the establishment of a bilateral Subcommission on Cooperation on the
Northern Sea Route]{.underline}.

Since 2022, [Beijing has taken the same stance on the Arctic as it has
on the war in Ukraine as a whole: neither condemning nor supporting
Moscow]{.underline}. Following the invasion, the seven other members of
the Arctic Council refused to attend any meetings chaired by Russia,
leading China to declare that it saw no point in excluding Russia and
suspend its own participation in the organization.

[China took the same approach to economic cooperation, continuing to
work with Russia on energy and infrastructure projects---until that
ceased to be viable]{.underline}. The story of Arctic LNG 2 is
indicative. In April 2019, two Chinese oil majors agreed to acquire a
combined 20 percent stake in the project, instantly making Beijing
Arctic LNG 2's largest investor. But in December 2023, CNPC and CNOOC
pulled out of the project in response to the tightening of U.S.
sanctions.

Between 2022 and 2023, Novatek, the Russian LNG producer behind Arctic
LNG 2, ordered gas turbine equipment and other technology from China for
the project. Beijing resisted U.S. pressure and continued to fulfill
these orders until January 2025, when sanctions imposed in the final
days of Joe Biden's presidency brought everything to a halt.

[Russia and China play up their scientific and cultural cooperation on
Arctic issues, but their practical use has been doubtful. While academic
contacts are often cited as a success story for Russia and China, they
grew less frequent after February 2022]{.underline}. Chinese students
still attend academic conferences in Russia, and joint expeditions to
the Arctic continue, but these initiatives do little to meaningfully
deepen Sino-Russian cooperation on regional issues.

The fact is that [expectations that China might expand its presence in
the Arctic through partnership with Russia have not been fulfilled. For
Beijing, the priority remains having the freedom to work with all the
Arctic's interested parties. As such, while China continued to fulfill
Russia's technology orders for energy projects in the Arctic and import
energy from the region, it has refrained from investing further in
Russia's Arctic initiatives out of fear of sanction]{.underline}s.

[China genuinely values its relationships with the Arctic's other
powers, and does not want to risk alienating them by getting overly
close to Russia]{.underline}. Since becoming an Arctic Council observer,
Beijing has looked for opportunities to work not only with Moscow but
also with others in the region, including Iceland and Norway.
Admittedly, its proposals are given less and less consideration
nowadays, with national security concerns usually cited as the reason.

[US and Russian officials have identified the Arctic as a possible area
for economic cooperation]{.underline}, according to people familiar with
the situation, part of the broader detente President Donald Trump is
pursuing with Moscow.

[Discussions have included natural resources exploration and trade
routes]{.underline}, said the people, who asked not to be identified as
the discussions are private and at an early stage[. Cooperation over
energy exploration is also seen as a goal by the US]{.underline}, one of
the people said.

The [topic emerged as Trump has aggressively pursued an end to the war
in Ukraine, including direct talks with Russia's President Vladimir
Putin. Both sides have recently signaled that they're open to business
ventures and cooperation, alarming European and NATO allies, which have
sought to isolate Moscow since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine three
years ago]{.underline}.

US and Russian officials plan to meet in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss
restoring embassy staffing levels, according to Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov.

One of the people said US officials see [Arctic cooperation as a way to
drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing, but cautioned that was
unlikely to succeed given how much closer Russia and China have grown in
recent years, particularly with their "no-limits" partnership since the
war in Ukraine began]{.underline}.

A spokesperson for the US National Security Council declined to comment.
A spokesman for the Kremlin didn't immediately respond to a request for
comment.

The Arctic, encircled by Russia and seven NATO members --- the US,
Canada and the Nordics Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden ---
has drawn increasing attention in recent years as melting ice from
climate change opens up shipping lanes and the possibility to explore
for potential energy and mineral resources.

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund,
said after US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia this month that cooperation
on Arctic energy projects was among "specific areas of cooperation" they
discussed, Politico reported.

Late last year, the [Pentagon released a new Arctic Strategy that
highlighted the risk of China and Russia teaming up in the region. Under
the Biden-era policy, the US aimed to expand its military readiness and
surveillance in the Arctic in response to "growing alignment" between
Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}.

[China has increasingly focused on the Arctic in recent years, declaring
itself in 2018 a "near-Arctic state" and has developed fishing, energy
and transportation interests in the region. The prospect of new shipping
routes is seen as key to Beijing's strategy, which envisions a Polar
Silk Road connecting East Asia, Western Europe and North
America]{.underline}.

The [Arctic is insufficiently prioritized amidst the United States'
competing global interests]{.underline}. The future battlefield is
melting and demands US attention, as a [partnership between Russia and
the People's Republic of China fuels strategic competition in the
Arctic. Thus, the United States must adopt a proactive Arctic strategy,
working with its NATO Allies to ensure that the Arctic remains stable
and free from conflict]{.underline}. The US's 2022 National Defense
Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United States "seeks a stable Arctic
region characterized by adherence to internationally agreed upon rules
and norms."1) [To achieve a secure Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy,
produced by the U.S. Department of Defense, follows a
"monitor-and-respond" approach. However, this reactive strategy is
inadequate]{.underline}.2)

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine provides evidence that Moscow will not
adhere to the current global order and will continue to challenge
Western international norms wherever possible, including in the Arctic.
NATO's growing appeal among European states suggests that NATO may also
be called upon to guarantee the future of Arctic stability. Instead of
dividing Europe, isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence[,
Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a closer alliance between
the United States and its Arctic NATO allies]{.underline}. Moreover,
NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden, has expanded,, and now
seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO members. The alliance
offers an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its position
in the Arctic region while not having to go it alone.

The current [US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions]{.underline}, though the makings of a
more effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024
Arctic Strategy. Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its
mindset towards the Arctic. [A proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in
which the United States and its NATO partners are not afraid to define
the rules and laws governing the north]{.underline}. Critics of this
approach will claim that taking a more assertive position in the Arctic
will further antagonize Russia and divert important resources from the
Indo-Pacific region and China. This is simply not the case. [Russia and
China have already taken steps to claim and militarize the Arctic. By
acting now, the US and its NATO allies will be better positioned to
counter the threat posed by Russia and China in the Arctic and
beyond]{.underline}.

Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic

Climate change has accelerated strategic competition in the region among
both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as China. Melting sea ice from
rising global temperatures has created new military and economic
opportunities in the region. Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed four
times faster than the rest of the world, according to an August 2022
scientific study published in Nature.3) As ice rapidly melts in the
Arctic, increased access to critical rare earth elements, such as
platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel emerge. Moreover, melting
ice is opening more easily traversed Arctic waters, which has led to a
surge of both military and commercial ship activity in the region. These
two developments have increased the potential for conflict in the
Arctic.

Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage. These minerals are required for
developing technologies ranging from renewable energy systems to
electronics used for national defense. According to the World Bank, the
demand to produce minerals, many of which are found in the Arctic, could
increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to meet the growing demand for
clean energy technologies.4) China already dominates the global supply
chain for critical materials. The United States depends on these
materials for its economic competitiveness and national defense.5)

As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more navigable. This has
resulted in more ship activity in the region. For instance, the Arctic
Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment
reports that there has been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and
distance sailed in the Arctic over the past ten years.6) While much of
this activity is commercial, [Russia and China have also taken advantage
of the new sea routes to project their naval power. They have carried
out numerous regional deployments and patrols, demonstrating their
ability to execute military operations in the austere Arctic
climate]{.underline}.7) The [expanded presence of Russian and Chinese
ships in the region poses a growing threat to NATO member
states]{.underline}. In October 2023, Finnish investigators suspected
the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging its anchor over the
seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and one pipeline. While
the international community has not assigned blame wholly to China,
[China later admitted to accidentally destroying an important gas
pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in 2024. These
examples suggest that incidents of this nature could become more likely
as military activity increases in the region.]{.underline}8)

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early warning
signs that the region could become a site of future conflict. [In 2021
Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good
Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a move described as "an act of
friendship against America]{.underline}."9) Moreover, [both Russia and
China have deep historic and economic ties to the Arctic]{.underline}.
NATO's expansion to include Finland and Sweden have increased tensions
in the region, while both Russia and China have expressed their
disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in the Arctic.10) However,
[despite feeling antagonized by NATO's actions, Moscow and Beijing may
not have the economic and military capacities to reshape the current
international rules-based order in the Arctic in the near
term]{.underline}.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not new.
Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to the sixteenth
century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was part of a
larger initiative to search for resources and trade routes.12) As the
nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. During the Cold War,
the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the Kola
Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic power.

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.14) According to Colin
Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the Arctic is heavily
weighted towards Russia." Furthermore, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the Arctic
Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.15) [Russia's
remilitarization of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership
with China, provides both countries with the means to challenge the
current Western rules-based international order]{.underline}.

[Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has rapidly
evolved over the past century. China's involvement in the Arctic began
in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty, providing a legal basis
for China to conduct non-military activity, such as scientific
exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the
Arctic]{.underline}.16) However, China's rationale to operate in the
region extends beyond scientific exploration.

In 2018 [China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State]{.underline}."17) China employs a dual
narrative to explain its aims in the Arctic. Externally, [Beijing
appeals to foreign audiences by advocating for the safeguarding of
international interests and promoting sustainable Arctic
development]{.underline}. However, this is [juxtaposed against the
narrative it promotes for domestic audiences, which emphasizes
competition for resources and China's desire to become a "polar great
power]{.underline}."18) The Svalbard Treaty has currently enabled China
to shroud its military activity and influence in the Arctic as
scientific exploration and global cooperation. But it is becoming clear
from its growing partnership with Russia and increasingly aggressive
military action in the Arctic that China's intentions to reshape the
international system extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific. [The U.S. and
NATO would be wise to recognize China's aims in the Arctic]{.underline}.

The [historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition]{.underline}. Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has
temporarily bolstered the West's position in the Arctic, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's accession into NATO
not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by over 650 percent and
moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from St. Petersburg, but it
also contributed to creating a divided Arctic, where nearly half belongs
to NATO while the remaining half is Russian territory.

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Pu[tin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance]{.underline} and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023,
Putin made good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with
tactical nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this
was the first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then in June
2024, Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical
nuclear weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members
Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced
by these actions, while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber,
it is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO.

[NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare
for conflict against Russia]{.underline}. In 2024 the head of the
Norwegian armed forces warned that NATO countries only have two to three
years to prepare for a Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik
Kristoffersen claims that Moscow is building up its military stockpile
faster than previously predicted, while Western nations have depleted
their own weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.22) Several other
[European leaders have echoed these concerns, citing that they have
between three and eight years to prepare for a Russian attack against
NATO]{.underline}.23) Despite Russia's aggressive rhetoric, Moscow
understands that because of its war against Ukraine it likely [will not
have the capability to attack NATO in the near future]{.underline}. For
instance[, Russia removed nearly all its ground forces from the Finnish
border to Ukraine]{.underline} in June 2024.24) [Russia's timeframe to
launch a successful attack is dependent not only on its economy but also
on its partnership with the PRC]{.underline}.

Why the U.S. Needs its Arctic NATO Allies

The United States has already begun to take a more active approach in
the Arctic; however, the region must become an even greater priority.
Following Finnish and Swedish accession to NATO, the alliance's center
of gravity, its primary source of strength and stability, shifted North
and closer to the Russian border. This is not the first instance of NATO
borders moving closer to Russia. In 2007, Putin provided a final
"friendly" warning that NATO expansion "represents a serious provocation
that reduces the level of mutual trust."25) The National Defense
Strategy ([NDS) reaffirms its commitment to NATO, underscoring the
importance of collective defense aimed at deterring Russian aggression.
Despite this stated commitment, the NDS does not directly address how it
will respond in the event that Russia attacks a NATO member state,
forcing the alliance to respond. While the current NDS and Arctic
Strategy offer assurances of protection to the U.S. homeland, a
proactive Arctic posture will mitigate future conflict in the
region]{.underline}.

The United States already views itself as a leader in the European
Arctic. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has sought to
uphold international law, close gaps in governance, and protect
sovereign rights in the European Arctic.26) The United States was
integral in developing multiple intergovernmental institutions,
including the Arctic Council in 1991.27) With [growing competition in
the European Arctic, the United States should continue to use its great
power status to insert itself as a lead actor in the region through the
establishment of a proactive Arctic Strategy coupled with enhanced
economic and military cooperation with its Nordic NATO
Allies]{.underline}. Today, while Russia is engrossed in its war against
Ukraine, the United States and its allies have the opportunity to remain
one step ahead.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the United States has begun
to increase its presence in the European High North. Underscoring the
importance of collective defense, the United States has entered into
several new bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCA) with Nordic
nations. In 2022, the United States signed a DCA with Norway, which
acknowledges that the presence of U.S. forces in Norway contributes to
strengthening the security and stability of the region and permit
American forces unimpeded access to four Norwegian military bases.28)
Since the establishment of the defense agreement, Norway and the United
States added an amendment, allowing U.S. forces and NATO allies to
access eight additional facilities in Norway for military purposes,
emphasizing the growing security threat in the European Arctic.29)
Following Norway's lead, Denmark signed its DCA with the United States
in 2023 followed by Finland and Sweden in 2024.30) DCAs such as these
offer increased and mutually beneficial opportunities for the United
States and its Nordic NATO Allies to prepare for any future hostilities.

As part of the US's proactive Arctic Strategy[, Washington should
prioritize economic investments in companies owned by NATO
members]{.underline}. Through these [investments, energy security within
NATO can be improved, and the nations can decrease their dependence on
rare earth materials from China]{.underline}. The [United States has
already taken initial steps]{.underline} to secure critical mineral and
clean energy supply chains, [but more can be done]{.underline}. In
September 2024, the United States signed a Critical Minerals Agreement
with Norway, demonstrating both countries' commitment to working
together to ensure energy security.31) Another such opportunity for the
[U.S. to further support its Nordic Allies exists in Sweden. In 2024 the
Swedish mining company LKAP discovered Europe's largest deposit of rare
earth elements in the northern city of Kiruna, Sweden]{.underline}.
Norway and Sweden have already begun collaborating to [increase energy
security through the Norwegian company, REETec, which has developed
technology to separate rare earth metals that competes with China's
production of these materials]{.underline}.32) According to the CEO of
LKAB, Jan Moström, this cooperation provides the foundation to develop a
"strong and sustainable Nordic value chain for rare earth metals."33) A
proactive U.S. Arctic Strategy that takes into consideration increased
NATO energy security through Nordic investment further bolsters the
United States' ability to decrease dependence on China and should be
pursued.

[Increased cooperation between the United States and its Nordic NATO
Allies provides an opportunity for the U.S. to couple a new proactive
Arctic Strategy with tangible training goals for forces at the tactical
and operational levels]{.underline}. For example, U.S. forces and their
Norwegian counterparts have benefited from a mutually supportive
military alliance for decades. During the Cold War, Norway was a
critical U.S. ally for power projection, defense, and deterrence in the
north. Its geostrategic location was optimal for protecting NATO's
northern flank from Soviet aggression so much so that the United States
stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and ammunition in strategic locations
across Norway.34) These stockpiles were crucial for increasing U.S.
power projection and enhancing NATO's operational responsiveness in the
European arena. Additionally, Norway's proximity to the Soviet Union and
the adjacent Norwegian and Barents Seas allowed NATO to challenge the
Soviets' ability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines if the Cold War
turned hot.

The U.S.--Norwegian Alliance has only grown since the end of the Cold
War. In 2017, the United States Marine Corps began sending a battalion
of Marines to Northern Norway as part of a rotational deployment. The
United States Marine Corps continues to deploy thousands of forces to
train alongside its Norwegian Allies annually. Moreover, in 2018, Norway
hosted Exercise Trident Juncture, a NATO-led military exercise based on
a fictitious Article 5 collective defense scenario. It was the largest
exercise of its kind in Norway since the 1980s, and 31 nations
participated.35) Large-scale multinational exercises of this kind
increase force proficiency operating in Arctic environments and enhance
NATO member states' ability to work with each other in wartime.

The United States has been increasing its ability to work with its
Swedish and Finnish counterparts in the case of war. [The United States
should establish bilateral training exercises with Sweden and Finland in
order to give these new NATO nations a greater understanding of how to
operate in a NATO construct]{.underline}. Conversely, [cooperation with
allies and partners improves U.S. forces' understanding of how to
operate effectively in an Arctic environment, making it a more reliable
and efficient partner for Arctic allies]{.underline}. This operational
experience ensures that allied forces are familiar with strategic
terrain that may be leveraged during a conflict with Russia.

Conclusion: How a Proactive Arctic Strategy Supports America's Focus on
the Indo-Pacific

The United States publication of the 2024 Arctic Strategy provides a
transparent approach aimed at reducing the possibility of escalation in
the Arctic. Moreover, [the current strategy recognizes Russia's and
China's Arctic ambitions and that the growing collaboration between
Russia and the PRC have "the potential to alter the Arctic's stability
and threat picture."]{.underline}36) The strategy presents a tangible
and realistic way forward for the U.S. to enhance the Joint Force's
Arctic capabilities, engage with Allies and partners, and demonstrate an
ability to work together across defense forces. [Although the strategy
indicates increased U.S. involvement in the Arctic, it remains
reactive.]{.underline} The 2024 Arctic Strategy already outlines a
tangible way for the United States to commit energy and resources to the
region. Although a deliberate shift in messaging will not change the
U.S. footprint in the Arctic, it will change the U.S. mindset towards
the region. By making the Arctic a priority, the U.S. demonstrates its
commitment to supporting its Allies in the event that Russia or China
attacks.

Furthermore, [by shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy, the United
States is not abandoning its focus on the Indo-Pacific, because the PRC
envisions itself as a polar power and intends to reshape the
international system in its favor. Future conflict with the PRC will not
be geographically constrained to the Indo-Pacific. By shifting to a
proactive Arctic Strategy now, the United States can deter China from
expanding its control over the Arctic and its critical
resources]{.underline}. The future battlefield is melting and only by
taking actions today can the United States and its NATO allies win
tomorrow's war in the Arctic.

#### Trump is already cutting the RCA apart

**Zhuang 25** \[Sylvie Zhuang, Bachelor of Arts from the University of
Illinois. \"Warming US-Russia ties could put China's Arctic ambitions on
ice, experts warn\", 3-16-2025,

[China is expected to redefine its Arctic policy]{.underline} --
including an ambition to become a great polar power by 2030 -- amid
growing scrutiny from far northern countries and a [possible US-Russia
cooperation deal for the region, according to experts and
insiders]{.underline}.

[Beijing put forward its plan for a "Polar Silk Road"]{.underline} -- as
a complement to its massive infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road
Initiative -- in a 2018 white paper that envisioned greater access to
the Arctic's rich natural resources and a bigger role in its governance.

China's description of itself in the plan as a "near-Arctic state" --
despite sitting 1,400km (870 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and
having no territory in the region -- raised the suspicions of the US and
its allies, in the midst of intensifying geopolitical rivalries.

It also [provoked a backlash from the Arctic countries]{.underline} --
[including Russia, which stretches across more than half of the region's
coastline and has long prioritised maintaining its sovereignty
there]{.underline}.

Since then, China has put more emphasis on science diplomacy --
including a focus on building heavy icebreakers and carrying out polar
observations -- while largely toning down its other ambitions.

According to Marc Lanteigne, a professor of political science at the
Arctic University of Norway, "[China has been trying to rework what the
Polar Silk Road is all about and it has also started to take a more
practical approach to the Arctic]{.underline}".

An insider with direct knowledge of the situation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, noted that [Beijing's interest in continuing its
Arctic push had appeared to decline in response to the geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}.

"The Chinese interest was really first announced quite aggressively in
the white paper \[with\] the term near-Arctic state that everybody seems
to have had problems with," the insider said.

"Now the [Chinese have stopped using that term and I think we've seen a
withdrawal, or a significantly lower Chinese interest in the
Arctic]{.underline}."

However, Duncan Depledge, an Arctic expert and lecturer in geopolitics
and security at Loughborough University in Britain, noted the continued
emphasis on building heavy icebreakers. "I'm not convinced that China's
interest in the Arctic has declined," he said.

"I believe China is still very interested in many of the opportunities
that exist to become more involved in Arctic science and commerce."

The commitment to carry out polar observations and develop heavy
icebreakers is part of China's national development strategy, written
into the 14th five-year plan for 2021-25.

China now has four of the sturdy vessels, of which the latest is the
Jidi, which means "polar region". It was completed last year to support
research in the Arctic alongside the Xuelong 1 and Xuelong 2
icebreakers.

In an interview with People's Daily in October, the China State
Shipbuilding Corporation's chief expert Wu Gang said that "[the key
technical challenge now for China is to build heavy
icebreakers]{.underline}".

With expertise concentrated in the Arctic nations and only Russia
possessing nuclear-powered icebreakers, China still faced a "long and
difficult road ahead", according to Wu's remarks in the report.

[China and Russia have been working together to develop the sea routes
that are opening up as a result of global warming, raising the
possibility of a lucrative permanent sea lane that would slash shipping
times between Europe and Asia]{.underline}.

In August last year, Premier Li Qiang and his Russian counterpart
Mikhail Mishustin signed a joint communique in which the two countries
agreed to develop Arctic shipping routes.

State-owned Chinese companies have also been exploring the region's
natural resources. In December, the China Oilfield Services rig COSL
Prospector discovered up to 52 million barrels of oil in an appraisal
well in Norwegian Arctic waters.

Nato has been concerned about China's activities in the region,
including its collaboration with Russia, the only non-member of the
military alliance that sits on the Arctic Council, the
inter-governmental organisation established in 1996.

The other members of the council are the United States, Canada, Norway,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. China and 12 other countries --
including France, Germany and Japan -- have observer status and can take
part in its discussions.

In 2022, Nato's then secretary general Jens Stoltenberg stressed the
need for the alliance to establish a stronger presence around the North
Pole, where Russian military activities were on the rise.

There are [signs that China-Russia cooperation in the region is
extending to military operations]{.underline}. In October, the Chinese
coastguard joined its Russian counterpart on patrol for the first time,
sailing from the North Pacific into the Arctic Ocean.

Without naming China directly, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly
said in December that Ottawa needed to be "tough" in its response to
growing Arctic competition because "many countries, including non-Arctic
states, aspire for a greater role in Arctic affairs".

Canadian concerns were also raised in 2020, when Ottawa blocked Chinese
state-owned Shandong Gold Mining from acquiring a Toronto-based firm
that runs a gold mine in the Arctic, on national security grounds.

But Beijing's collaboration with Moscow should be viewed as "more
occasional than strategic", according to the anonymous insider. "I think
it's very important that we distinguish clearly between Russia and
China," the source said.

"[Russia poses an immediate military threat and the Chinese goals are
more long term]{.underline} -- focused on research and shipping -- and
\[China's\] military interest tends to be quite far away \[from Nordic
countries\]."

The [sudden warming of the relationship between Russia and the US since
President Donald Trump's return to the White House may also affect
China's Arctic ambitions]{.underline}, according to Loughborough
University's Depledge.

[China's bilateral ties with Russia have deepened significantly over the
years, strengthened by their shared view of the US as a
rival]{.underline}, and culminated in Beijing's pledge of a "no-limits"
partnership with Moscow, days before the invasion of Ukraine.

But [Washington's sudden shift on its Ukraine stance under Trump has
created uncertainties for Beijing]{.underline}, with the US pursuing a
ceasefire while also looking to restore relations with Russia.

[Trump has already expressed an interest in the Arctic and a deal
between the US and Russia that includes cooperation in the
region]{.underline} could get under way after their discussions on
Ukraine.

"I think [China for now will struggle, particularly in a scenario where
Trump and Putin made a deal on the Arctic]{.underline}, which was
explicitly trying to exclude China from the region," Depledge said.

"If all of that happens, then it becomes a question of who would Russia
rather work with? Would they rather work with China or would they rather
work with Trump? Or will they seek to maintain a balance between the
two?"

Given the shifting dynamics between Washington and Moscow, China's
reliance on Russia for its access to the Arctic could be "a risky
strategy", according to Depledge, who also noted that "it [would be
quite hard for China to find other ways in]{.underline}".

Lanteigne, from the Arctic University of Norway also noted that China
remained dependent on "Russia's goodwill" to access the polar region,
while pointing out that there was added uncertainty for Beijing arising
from a less functional Arctic Council.

In addition to its role in negotiating treaties -- such as search and
rescue agreements and scientific collaborations -- the council is tasked
with addressing the implications of climate change, which could lead to
tensions with a climate-sceptic Trump White House.

Russia's presence on the assembly has been weakened by the war in
Ukraine, while there are already strains in US ties with council members
Canada and Denmark -- over tariffs and the future of Greenland,
respectively.

The anonymous insider described the Arctic Council as a "struggling"
organisation, adding that -- given the geopolitical circumstances -- "to
keep it alive alone is probably going to be hard".

A [dysfunctional Arctic Council could lead to China losing its platform
to build collaborative partnerships with the far northern
countries]{.underline}, take part in scientific research, and channel
its influence in the region.

This could be seen as one of the [most urgent significant issues facing
Beijing as it considers the changing Arctic landscape and broader
geopolitical shifts that are taking place]{.underline}, according to
Lanteigne.

"Right now, the biggest question is how the council will be able to
function under these circumstances. And if it's not able to function,
this will probably [cause a lot of debate within China
about]{.underline}, what do we do next."

The [international structures that have helped address many Arctic
problems through negotiation and cooperation are insufficient for the
military and security challenges brought on by climate
change]{.underline}.

Decades of diplomacy have fostered forums such as the Arctic Council,
which regularly brings together stakeholders (including Arctic and
non-Arctic government representatives, indigenous leaders, business
interests) to seek agreement on issues such as search and rescue, oil
pollution and scientific cooperation. Another one, the Arctic Frontiers
conference, wraps up Jan. 30 in Tromsø, Norway. Other meetings like the
Arctic Circle, Arctic Dialogues, and the Arctic Shipping Forum enable
further debate.

But such meetings and institutions have been less successful at
addressing military operations in the region. In part, this is because
if armed forces are present in the Arctic, it's often connected to some
high-stakes geopolitical issue --- Russian activity in Ukraine or the
U.S. stance on Freedom of Navigation --- and thus deliberately avoided.
The Arctic Council, for example, explicitly eschews any discussion of
military matters. [The Arctic Coast Guard Forum focuses on issues of
safety, environmental stewardship, law enforcement, and operational
response --- but not military operations]{.underline}.

There is an Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and a limited number of
bi-lateral or multi-lateral Arctic security exercises. These provide
some opportunities for engagement but lack the consistency or clear
mission of non-military Arctic cooperative activities. Furthermore, the
Security Forces Roundtable has excluded Russia since 2014, when it
seized Crimea and launched military activity in Ukraine.

Creating a regular, inclusive discussion of defense issues is vital for
the Arctic region, where the greatest near-term security risk may be
that of military miscalculation. Resource wars are far off and unlikely;
most potentially profitable ventures are in undisputed areas. Investors
and insurers can weigh profit and risk potential on that front.

But there are at least two scenarios that could lead to dangerous
military miscalculation:

A [race to militarize the Arctic, which will not only result in
diplomatic consequences and potentially dampen emerging economic
prospects, but also increase the likelihood of military assets coming
into close contact]{.underline}; or

The perception that there's a void in security and stewardship -- fueled
by potential increases in ship collisions, illegal fishing, and
demonstrated limitations in search and rescue ability --- that opens the
door for countries like China to justify an increase in their own
regional capabilities.

The former scenario represents too much security. The latter could
emerge under too little. The two scenarios are equally dangerous and
shifting conditions could tip the balance in either direction. Either
could begin with non-adversarial intensions and "snowball" into
increased military activity and decreased space for dialogue and
cooperation. Both are avoidable, but only if there are opportunities to
gain mutual understanding, if not more formal security cooperation.

What type of forum would fulfill such a need? There are three existing
options, none of which are presently ideal.

First, the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable could be more closely
modeled after the Arctic Council and [Arctic Coast Guard Forum in their
focus on inclusivity, open and regular multi-lateral dialogue, and
finding common ground on policy. Given its explicit focus on military
issues and direct approach to dialogue, this is probably the best
option. The biggest hurdle here could be getting the U.S. to accept
Russian and (perhaps) Chinese membership]{.underline}.

Second, the Arctic Council [or Arctic Coast Guard Forum could expand
their purviews to include Arctic regional-specific military issues.
However, security issues are so sensitive that including them could
undermine these organizations' effectiveness in conducting their present
missions]{.underline}.

Third, forums such as the Arctic Circle (and perhaps smaller gatherings
such as the upcoming Arctic Frontiers meeting) could more robustly aim
for less formal, Track II diplomacy. This may already be happening to
some extent. The Arctic Circle especially attracts diverse and sometimes
high-level government official participation. It isn't clear, however,
whether such a backchannel diplomatic approach could be sufficiently
scaled up in a future Arctic where there are more frequent and
fast-moving issues on the table.

Dia[logue on touchy military issues in the Arctic is becoming
increasingly important to avoid either the "military heavy" or "security
void" scenarios. An Arctic war would have no winner. Anyone who ends up
on top militarily in the region would be left with the costly and
time-intensive task of running security in a region too devastated to
enjoy what little economic gains are possible as more of it becomes
navigable]{.underline}.

#### AT: Kupchan: It's too late to split the RCA

**Bandow 25** \[Doug Bandow, senior fellow at the Cato Institute,
specializing in foreign policy and civil liberties, \"America\'s Great
Mistake: Pushing Russia and China Together\", 1-28-2025,

The United States is the world's most powerful nation, with the most
advanced military and largest economy. It enjoys the most enviable
geographic position of any great power in history, luxuriating in
splendid near isolation with only two weak and pacific neighbors.

The US also is allied with most of the central industrial states. Even
as the Trump administration seeks to curtail American trade with the
world, other nations clamored for greater commercial relations with
Americans. The US attracts immigrants worldwide and possesses enormous
"soft power," including a globe-spanning culture.

America Fears the New Axis...

Yet denizens of the imperial city of Washington, D.C. are uneasy.

[Running a proxy war-plus against a nuclear-armed power over interests
it believes to be existential is reckless and dangerous under any
circumstances]{.underline}.

The [emergence of several adversary regimes]{.underline}, of late tagged
as the Axis of Disruption, Axis of Upheaval, Axis of Autocracy, and even
new Axis of Evil, has come as a terrible shock to the imperial wannabes
in Washington, yielding much wailing and gnashing of teeth. The Carnegie
Endowment's Christopher S. Chivvis and Jack Keating warn: "Historical
precedents from the 1930s and the early Cold War suggest that even
deeper cooperation among them is possible and that a more coherent bloc
determined to blunt and roll back U.S. power worldwide might develop."

Of [greatest concern is the relationship between Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}. Robert D. Blackwill and Richard Fontaine,
respectively with the Council on Foreign Relations and Center for a New
Security Policy, criticize those who minimize the degree of cooperation:
"[the China-Russia relationship continues to deepen and widen, and
occasional disagreements are dwarfed by the scale and momentum of their
strategic cooperation. Theirs is a formidable partnership bordering on
alliance, bound together by resistance to what they view as a U.S.-led,
anachronistic international order, one that does not permit either
country its rightful place despite their power, history, domestic
legitimacy, civilizational triumphs, and vital regional
interests]{.underline}."

Other analysts also paint the new "axis" as a dire threat. One could be
forgiven believing that America had been transported back to 1939 or
1956, on the verge of World War II or in the midst of the Cold War. A
Brookings Institution analysis published last month cited several
factors as "top threats to vital U.S. interests": supporting Russia
against Ukraine, challenging US hegemony in the Indo-Pacific, and
"weakening the underpinnings of American leadership on the world stage
and core elements of the existing rules-based international order."
[None of these seem truly vital for a superpower that dominates its own
hemisphere and faces so few direct threats, but such is Washington's
almost pathological fear of any foreign challeng]{.underline}e.

A Different Time, a Different View on Russia

[Analysts once proposed conciliating Moscow]{.underline}. For instance,
in 2021 Charles Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations opined that
"as Biden builds a coalition to tame Beijing, he also needs to work the
other side of the equation by weakening China's own international
partnerships. He can't stop China's rise, but he can limit its influence
by trying to lure away from China its main collaborator: Russia."

[Kupchan urged Washington to help "Russia redress the vulnerabilities
that its relations with China put in stark relief." However, shortly
thereafter came the Ukraine crisis, ending serious support for engaging
Moscow. As the war dragged on the allied desire grew to convince Beijing
to break the partnership. Analysts similarly discussed strategies to use
the PRC to divide Russia and its other dubious associates, most
importantly North Korea]{.underline}.

Some analysts, such as the Atlantic Council's John Herbst, suggested
that Moscow is likely to drift back westward so no special concessions
to anyone are needed. Others urge a more active approach. For instance,
in October President Donald Trump declared: "the one thing you never
want to happen is you never want Russia and China uniting. I'm going to
have to un-unite them, and I think I can do that." However, he offered
no strategy or timeframe for playing a "reverse Nixon" on China and
Russia.

Whom to Ally With?

The idea of weakening the opposing coalition and even turning one of
Washington's chief antagonists into a minor partner is obviously
appealing. However, with whom should the US seek to effectively ally?

In 1972, China was the obvious counterweight to a much more dangerous
Soviet Union. No longer. While the Europeans want Beijing to stop aiding
Russia's war effort against Ukraine, virtually no one imagines a present
need for the West to align with the PRC against Russia, a declining
power. Even victory in Ukraine would leave Moscow weaker than before the
war began. Despite Europe's desperate nightmares of Putin conquering the
continent, there is little sign that Moscow possesses either the will or
the ability to take on NATO, let alone America.

Thus, today the PRC is widely recognized as the more threatening power.
Although China's continuing dramatic rise is no longer seen as quite so
inevitable, Beijing is likely to be an increasingly formidable adversary
in the future. Thus, the sensible objective would be to make Moscow a
partner and friend, if not an ally, of America and Europe. Alas, that
will be almost impossible so long as the Russo-Ukraine war rages and
will remain difficult even if the conflict ultimately settles, given the
severe damage done to US and European relations with Moscow.

In fact, there is a dearth of will in Washington to improve relations
with either country. The belief in America's virginal omnipotence is
bipartisan and overwhelming. Hence, compromise is widely regarded as
unthinkable. For instance, Brookings insisted that "It would be
extremely misguided to try to win over one or both parties through
fundamental concessions, such as endorsing China's claims to Taiwan or
recognizing Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories. Such
appeasement would not only undermine U.S. credibility with its allies
and partners but also embolden China, Russia, and other revisionist
regimes to engage in further aggression."

Instead, the general Washington view is that the US should double down,
more strongly and effectively punishing both major "axis" members.
However, Russia already has weathered multiple rounds of sanctions.
[China's greater integration in the world economy gives the West more
retaliatory options, but the PRC also enjoys more commercial partners.
The Brookings commentary suggested that "A mix of strategic and
reputational costs, such as the threat of secondary sanctions, as well
as diplomatic incentives, should be employed to push Beijing to limit
and constructively leverage its ties with Russia]{.underline}." However,
the PRC so far has maneuvered carefully. Noted the Economist: "Taking
advantage of Russia's semi-isolation, China is buying its oil and gas at
low prices, and will soon pay for more of it with its non-convertible
currency, the yuan. Ever-cautious about its interests, China has avoided
overt challenges to Western sanctions."

Moreover, the cost of sustained economic war would be high for all and
the US would find little support for such a campaign in the Global South
and even among its own allies, especially in Asia. Moreover, the West
already is punishing Beijing for other reasons---relations with North
Korea, threats against Taiwan, advances in critical technologies, abuses
of human rights, and more. The longer the list of American sanctions,
the more likely China is to decouple than concede.

Blackwill and Fontaine would not only expand economic sanctions, but
also increase military outlays, seek new military partners, increase
military deployments, enhance military alliances, and up military aid.
All of these would raise tensions and likely push Beijing to respond
accordingly. Nor do the authors specify how to pay for their program
when the US government seems to be plunging toward insolvency---with
interest payments over \$1 trillion annually, annual deficits
approaching \$2 trillion a year, and the national debt at 100 percent of
GDP, headed for twice that by mid-century. There is little will to make
massive cuts in social welfare programs or to enact draconian tax hikes.

The [Plan to Break the Axis]{.underline}

Even if Washington attempted to disrupt relations between China and
Russia, how could it do so?

Despite some tensions between the two, their relationship is much more
harmonious today than throughout much of their history. Nixon made his
move shortly after open border warfare between Russia and China. In
contrast, Observed Jo Inge Bekkevold of Norway's Institute for Defence
Studies: "by comparing today's Sino-Russian ties to the past Sino-Soviet
alignment along five key factors---geopolitics, economics, ideology,
leadership, and institutions---it becomes obvious that the
Beijing-Moscow axis is stronger today on all accounts."

Moreover, [neither Beijing nor Moscow has reason to trust Washington.
The basic problem, noted Brookings, is that "China and Russia's
strategic partnership will persist as long as each continues to see the
United States as its principal adversary. The United States maintains a
significant trust deficit with both Beijing and Moscow which creates
challenges for bilateral engagement. Neither Beijing nor Moscow believes
that they have anything to gain by working with Washington to check the
other's influence." Who can blame them]{.underline}?

Washington's policy toward both is overtly hostile. The Trump
administration would have to convince one or both governments that
turning westward served their interests. Observed Chivvis and Keating:
"What these states do share is an autocratic antipathy for the liberal
aspects of the U.S.-led order, which they believe threatens their very
existence. This is important because threat perceptions play a key role
in the formation of alliances, blocs, and groups." How to reduce
Beijing's threat perceptions when Washington is unabashedly seeking to
contain the PRC militarily and economically, in effect treating it as a
likely enemy?

[Moscow is an even tougher case. In earlier times Kupchan suggested that
Washington "should exploit Russia's own misgivings about its status as
China's junior partner. By helping Russia redress the vulnerabilities
that its relations with China put in stark relief---in effect, helping
Russia help itself---Biden can encourage Moscow to drift away from
Beijing." Another idea was encouraging Moscow "to help check China's
growing influence in developing areas, including Central Asia, the
broader Middle East, and Africa]{.underline}."

#### Natural Disasters are exacerbated by Climate Change

**Crimmins 22** \[Megan Crimmins, Writer for PBS on climate change - The
Public Broadcasting Service is an American public broadcaster and
non-commercial, free-to-air television network based in Arlington,
Virginia, 9-7-2022, How Climate Change Impacts Each Type of Natural
Disaster, Peril & Promise,
https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2022/09/how-climate-change-impacts-each-type-of-natural-disaster/,
7-28-2025\] //dax

The term [natural disaster is defined as "a sudden and terrible event in
nature that usually results in serious damage and many deaths."
According to the World Economic Forum, the most common natural disasters
include floods, storms, earthquakes, extreme temperatures, landslides,
droughts, wildfires, and volcanic activity]{.underline}. How does
climate change impact each of these extreme events?

FLOODS

Floods are the most frequent natural disaster and have impacted every
U.S. state and nearly every country. [The connection between floods and
climate change comes down to a few ways that climate change is impacting
water. First, higher temperatures lead to increased levels of
evaporation, creating denser clouds that hold more water. This
eventually leads to heavier precipitation that can cause flooding.
Second, more frequent and intense storms such as hurricanes can lead to
floods. Finally, higher sea levels due to melting glaciers can also
prompt coastal flooding.]{.underline}

Floods can also be exacerbated by how humans manage waterways and spur
urbanization.

STORMS

[Storms are impacted by climate change in the same way that some floods
are, via the effect that higher temperatures have on evaporation and
subsequent precipitation. With clouds holding increased amounts of water
vapor, more powerful storms develop.]{.underline}

EARTHQUAKES

The connection between earthquakes and climate change is slightly less
straightforward, and certainly less influential. Most earthquakes occur
when tectonic plates within the Earth's crust change or move. Many
things can lead to this, but where climate change comes into play is
once again related to water. [Earthquakes can be triggered or prevented
by variability in stress on a fault between tectonic plates. Stress on
these faults is impacted by surface water from rain or
snow]{.underline}. When there is heavier rainfall, this precipitation
and any subsequent flooding increases stress and decreases seismicity.
[When the season dries up and there's less water, the weight on the
Earth's crust decreases and this can lead to
microseismicity.]{.underline}

As of now, the majority of the connection between earthquakes and
climate change is with microseismicity, or tiny earthquakes, which have
magnitudes of less than zero and are so small that humans can't feel
them. While additional connections can be made, such as impacts from
pumping groundwater during droughts, connections between larger
earthquakes and climate change have largely not been proven, though the
rapid movement of glaciers has also been shown to cause glacial
earthquakes.

EXTREME TEMPERATURES

[Climate change can lead to both extreme high temperatures and extreme
low temperatures. The connection with extreme high temperatures is more
intuitive --- greenhouse gases are being trapped in the atmosphere and
this leads to warming. However, the connection to extreme low
temperatures can be harder for some people to make. Lower temperatures
in some regions are a result of the polar vortex being warmer, causing
it to weaken and dip down further than it normally would, bringing with
it colder temperatures]{.underline}. This is further exacerbated by
impacts to the jet stream that change the pattern of where and when hot
and cold temperatures typically occur. These two combined have led to
hotter summers and harsher winters in some areas.

LANDSLIDES

[Landslides are connected to rainfall as well. Due to climate change's
impact on evaporation and precipitation, more frequent and intense
rainfall events can lead to more landslides]{.underline}.

DROUGHTS

[On the other side of the water spectrum are droughts, though they
result from the same process. Droughts are a natural part of the climate
cycle, but climate change is making them more frequent, severe, and
prolonged.]{.underline} While higher levels of evaporation lead to
eventual severe rainfall, in some regions, this shift means [drier
conditions due to the loss of the evaporated water, which can lead to
drought and dried out soils and vegetation]{.underline}. With climate
change, places that are traditionally dry are becoming drier through the
higher levels of evaporation and places that are traditionally wet are
becoming wetter through the higher levels of rainfall that result.

WILDFIRES

W[ildfires are a consequence of the drier condition]{.underline}s caused
by climate change in some areas. [The wildfire season is much longer
than in previous years and the number of wildfires per season has
tripled. Severe heat and drought provide fuel for fires through drier
soils and vegetation that is more flammable. Additionally, due to warmer
temperatures, snowpacks are melting earlier, meaning that forests are
drier for longer periods of time and increasingly at risk of
fires.]{.underline}

VOLCANIC ACTIVITY

Similar to earthquakes, [volcanic activity has a less direct
relationship with climate change. Volcanoes do contribute to changes in
Earth's atmosphere through spewing CO2, aerosols, ash, and metals into
the atmosphere, but they have a net cooling effect. This is due to the
impact that aerosols have on cooling versus warming.]{.underline}

On the flip side, there is some evidence to suggest that [climate change
could increase eruptions in a similar way that they impact seismic
activity]{.underline}, through lessening the pressure on the Earth's
surface. In this case, this decreased pressure causes more hot magma to
come in contact with aquifers, which triggers eruptions. [Additionally,
melting glaciers are exposing more volcanoes.]{.underline}

#### Logistical support is key to Coast Guard operations.

We testified about the [Coast Guard\'s operations in the
Arctic]{.underline} and the [challenges]{.underline} it faces there.

The [Coast Guard has evaluated evolving risks in the region---including
from climate change and increased ship traffic. It has deployed ships to
the region to cut response times, among other actions to mitigate
risks.]{.underline}

[But]{.underline} the Coast Guard hasn\'t been able to meet all its
commitments in the region. Challenges include:

[Not enough data to make planning decisions]{.underline}

Delays and cost overruns for new ships

A \$7 billion backlog of shore infrastructure projects across the Coast
Guard

Our previous reports recommended ways to address these and other issues.

Highlights

What GAO Found

The [Coast Guard has assessed risks that affect its ability to carry out
its missions in the U.S. Arctic region, such as those posed by increased
maritime activity and by potential adversaries such as Russia and
China]{.underline}. It has partnered with the Department of Defense and
others to mitigate these risks and included this information in planning
documents. These plans include the Coast Guard's Arctic strategy and its
implementation plan. However, the implementation plan does not include
key metrics such as performance measures, targets, or timeframes for
action items. This may make it [difficult for the Coast Guard to
determine resource needs, assess progress toward strategic objectives,
and ensure its efforts are aligned with national Arctic efforts. GAO
also found that key mission performance information was incomplete or
missing, such as the number of days ships were deployed in the Arctic
region and the time they spent on various missions there.]{.underline}

The Coast Guard has multiple strategic commitments for its Arctic
operations but has been unable to meet all of them in recent years in
part due to asset availability challenges. These include a lack of
icebreakers, and competing demands for major cutters elsewhere. Further,
[limited infrastructure and logistics capabilities in Alaska amplify
asset challenges in the Arctic region. The Coast Guard is making efforts
to address them via major acquisition projects, such as for the new
Polar Security Cutter, but these ships continue to face significant
delays and cost issues. Since 2016, GAO has issued several reports and
made numerous recommendations to improve Coast Guard Arctic planning and
acquisition programs.]{.underline}

Coast Guard Operational and Planned Fleet of Polar Icebreakers, 2024

The [Coast Guard uses its shore infrastructure assets---such as piers
and maintenance buildings---to support legacy assets that operate in the
Arctic region, such as icebreakers and other cutters. In 2019, GAO found
that the estimated cost of the Coast Guard's shore infrastructure
project backlog totaled at least \$2.6 billion.]{.underline} GAO made
six recommendations to address these issues, two of which the Coast
Guard has fully implemented. However, as of November 2024, GAO's
preliminary analysis showed that the estimated cost of this shore
infrastructure backlog had more than doubled to over \$7 billion.

Why GAO Did This Study

Since the Arctic is largely a maritime domain, the U.S. Coast Guard, a
multi-mission military service within the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), plays a key role in Arctic policy implementation and
enforcement. As more navigable ocean water has emerged and human
activity increases in the region, the [Coast Guard faces growing
responsibilities to assess and manage risks. These include risks to
maritime safety, security, and the environment.]{.underline}

[This statement discusses: (1) Coast Guard actions to assess and
mitigate risks in the Arctic region, and (2) key challenges the Coast
Guard faces that may affect its Arctic operations and its ability to
meet its strategic commitments.]{.underline}

This statement is based primarily on our 2024 report examining Coast
Guard Arctic operational risks, and our 2023 report on Coast Guard
acquisitions. This statement also includes updated 2024 data on the
Coast Guard's shore infrastructure backlog. For the reports cited in
this statement, GAO analyzed Coast Guard and Department of Defense
documentation and data, and interviewed officials from these agencies.

Recommendations

GAO has made more than 30 recommendations since 2016 to the [Coast
Guard]{.underline} and DHS in [reports on Coast Guard Arctic operations,
acquisition, and shore infrastructure issues]{.underline}. As of
November 2024, 19 remain open. GAO continues to monitor progress on
these recommendations.

[Russia has long been the geopolitical kingpin of the
Arctic]{.underline}, with deeply-embedded military, [commercial and
strategic investments in the region]{.underline}.

[But now that the U]{.underline}.S. [and NATO are pivoting their focus
to the Arctic for geoeconomic and security reasons]{.underline}, Moscow
is getting tetchy about the West's newfound interest.

[That's perhaps to be expected]{.underline}, given Russia's territorial
stake in the region: [Russia spans 53%]{.underline} (or over 22,990
miles) [of the Arctic Ocean coastline]{.underline}, [and out of its
population of around 146 million people]{.underline}, 2.[5 millions
Russians live and work there]{.underline}, [according to the Arctic
Institute]{.underline}, a center for circumpolar security studies.

[For locals]{.underline} --- [and the wider Russian economy]{.underline}
--- [strategic drivers of jobs]{.underline}, [investment and growth
include oil]{.underline}, [gas and mineral extraction
industries]{.underline}, fisheries, [and infrastructure and
transportation logistics]{.underline}, [particularly related to the
Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, [a major Arctic shipping route for
Russia between Europe and Asia]{.underline}.

[In addition]{.underline}, [Russia maintains its sea-based nuclear
deterrent in the Arctic and has a number of military bases and airfields
there]{.underline}, as well a specialized fleet of ice breakers to
facilitate trade, [transportation and resource extraction in the
territory]{.underline}.

[This is why Russia watches closely when U]{.underline}.S. [President
Donald Trump says he's going to take over the resource-rich Arctic
island of Greenland]{.underline}, [or when NATO carries out Arctic war
games]{.underline}.

"NATO countries in general are increasingly designating the Far North as

commented as NATO allies conducted war drills in Norway in March that
involved 10,000 NATO troops from nine allied nations.

[Russia defending interests]{.underline}

[Russia is looking to aggressively expand its economic interests in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [with the region contributing significant value to

["Today]{.underline}, [the Arctic already produces 7]{.underline}.5% of
Russia's gross domestic product and more than 11% of its exports,"
Alexey Chekunkov, [minister for the Development of the Russian Far East
and Arctic]{.underline}, said last week in comments reported by
newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta, [and translated by Google]{.underline}.

[Russia was "implementing global-scale investment projects in the Arctic
and developing the world's largest network of Arctic cities," he
added]{.underline}.

["As the projects that have already begun are implemented]{.underline},
[the importance of the Arctic in Russia's economy]{.underline},
[logistics]{.underline}, [and security will only increase," Chekunkov
said]{.underline}, noting that "it is difficult to overestimate the
importance of the Northern Sea Route, which provides a 40% shorter route
between Europe and Asia."

[Russia has looked to evade sanctions by using a so-called "shadow
fleet" of vessels and tankers to export its oil and gas supplies to
customers still willing to buy them]{.underline}, [with Ukraine's
Western allies playing catch-up to try to close loopholes that have
allowed Moscow to do this]{.underline}.

[Marie-Anne Coninsx]{.underline}, [former EU ambassador for the
Arctic]{.underline}, [told CNBC Wednesday that the Arctic was "of
crucial strategic interest for Russia]{.underline}, [economically and
\[in terms of\] security]{.underline}. It's an enormous source of GDP
because of the extraction of energy resources, [and the use of the
Northern Sea Route is an enormous income for Russia]{.underline}. [And
with this income]{.underline}, [and despite the sanctions]{.underline},
[Russia has been able to finance one third of the cost of the war in
Ukraine with these exports," she told CNBC's "Squawk Box
Europe."]{.underline}

[NATO focuses on the Arctic as geopolitical tensions rise]{.underline}:
[former EU Arctic ambassador]{.underline}

["The sanctions are having an effect but should go further]{.underline},
because it it is touching the the Russian economy, but there is the
other aspect of security, [because Russians known its nuclear powers are
in the Arctic]{.underline}, and this is a serious threat for Europe,"
she said.

[The West playing catch-up?]{.underline}

[One of the problems for Europe and NATO's Arctic strategy is that it is
only playing catch-up when compared to Russia's long-standing
development of its Arctic territory]{.underline}.

[Russia began reinvesting in Arctic affairs in the
mid-2000s]{.underline}, said analysts at the Center for European Policy
Analysis (CEPA), adding that "the Kremlin remains adamant in asserting
complete control over the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation," as it
looks to protect perceived vital interests along the Northern Sea Route.

[In contrast]{.underline}, the West's renewed interest in the Arctic has
been largely spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

"Until \[that\], I would say there was no real NATO awareness of the
security threat in the Arctic, [it was neglecting its northern flank,"
former EU ambassador to the Arctic Coninsx told CNBC]{.underline}.

["But due to the invasion of Russia in Ukraine]{.underline}, [and
particularly thanks to the new membership \[in the alliance\] of Sweden
and Finland]{.underline}, there is a strengthening security force from
NATO in northern Europe \... And for the European Union, [it has become
more important for geo-economic and geopolitical security
reasons."]{.underline}

[The Arctic "is becoming the center of world attention" also for
"geoeconomic reasons"]{.underline} --- including the fact that climate
change meant the wealth of natural resources and critical minerals in
the Arctic were now more accessible, [and there are more shipping
opportunities along the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}.

["Therefore there is an increased interest also for major geopolitical
players]{.underline}, not only of the U.S., [but also from non-Arctic
states]{.underline}, [major ones like China," she said]{.underline}.

The Land Component: The Capabilities are Available, But Not the Enablers
In principle, land power should be the most non-fungible US strategic
capability in a two-war scenario.152 While there is certainly a land
component to any conceivable Indo-Pacific conflict, the conditions for
success or failure are likely to be set at sea and in the air. Since any
Chinese approach to Taiwan must presume air and naval superiority, given
the low likelihood of the PLA achieving local preponderance at its
beach-heads, if Chinese forces do land on Taiwan and achieve a breakout
it will be because they were enabled by these two factors. If this is
the case, [there is little evidence that additional support to a Taiwan
ground component could be flowed into the island]{.underline}. Equally,
if the conditions for substantial US ground forces to flow into Taiwan
can be set in the air and at sea, [this would be synonymous with the
failure of a Chinese invasion in any case]{.underline}, as any
disembarked force would necessarily be cut off from the mainland. 150.

this scenario is treated as external to the analysis for this report.
[40 The Impact of a Taiwan Strait Crisis on European Defence Sidharth
Kaushal and Juliana Suess This is not because land forces are irrelevant
in a Taiwan contingency]{.underline}. Considerable historical data
suggests that a well-entrenched land component can hold an invading
force in an island assault under conditions of numerical inferiority and
inferiority in the air and at sea, [and that attackers often require a
more than 3]{.underline}:1 preponderance in land forces.153 On Okinawa
in April 1945, for example, entrenched Japanese forces held for three
months against a US force that outnumbered them 5:1, with the US Tenth
Army expending 2.4 million shells in the battle.154 It can thus
certainly be argued that the ability of the Taiwan land component to
both contest an initial beach-head and protract a conflict sets the
conditions for effective denial in the air and at sea by buying time for
US forces. Many of the capabilities relevant to a land war in Europe,
such as guided MLRS, V-SHORAD and tube artillery, would certainly be
relevant in this context. However, the success of any land battle would
be largely predicated on the assets already in Taiwan when a conflict
broke out. Assuming the PLAN and the PLAAF are able to achieve a level
of air superiority sufficient to enable an outnumbered assault force to
break out of its beach-heads (the only context in which a protracted
land battle can occur), this would preclude any additional land forces
from being surged into the theatre, as some have argued they might
be.155 For example, the US Navy can, in principle, support the insertion
of heavy armour into Taiwan with its ship-to-shore connector, but with a
[25-nautical-mile radius]{.underline}, doing so under conditions of
adversary air superiority would entail amphibious vessels taking
unacceptable levels of risk for the insertion of relatively small
amounts of armour.156 Access to ports, which can be utilised by
strategic sealift assets, would also be unlikely under these
circumstances. It might be argued that, in due course, a successful US
effort to roll back the PLAN and the PLAAF could enable land forces to
be flowed into pockets of the theatre still held by Taiwan's forces, to
enable the PLAGF to be progressively rolled back on the island -- in a
manner comparable to the US Army and Republic of Korea army's defence
and breakout from the Pusan Perimeter in September 1940.157 However, if
the PLA does secure a level of air superiority sufficient to prevent its
forces from being stopped either at its beachheads or in the littoral
and to allow the subsequent seizure of a port to allow the flow of
non-amphibious units, there will be little time for reinforcement. In
amphibious assaults over the course of the last century, when a force
that did not enjoy numerical preponderance at the outset of the assault
succeeded, it typically 153. See Malkasian, 'Charting the Pathway to

The Impact of a Taiwan Strait Crisis on European Defence Sidharth
Kaushal and Juliana Suess did so in less than a month.158 This broadly
reflects the fact that if the numerically inferior force could not be
defeated at its beach-heads, it was enabled to succeed by a level of air
and naval superiority that caused the defence to collapse rapidly. The
only exception to this was the Battle of Iwo Jima, which lasted for a
month but in which air and naval power did not play a decisive role in
routing the defence.[159 Even if Chinese forces took a month to seize a
major Taiwan seaport to enable the flow of follow-on
forces]{.underline}, it would probably be longer than this before the US
could safely surge land forces into the theatre. In effect, then, [if
the PLA's air superiority is sufficient to prevent a numerically
inferior force from being beaten on the beaches]{.underline}, [a Taiwan
defence will collapse before the conditions for reinforcements to enter
the theatre can be set]{.underline}. This is not to suggest that the PLA
will necessarily secure the level of air and sea superiority needed to
enable a successful invasion. Rather, the argument is that the crux of
any defence of Taiwan will be denying it this superiority. If this is
achieved, it is likely that Taiwan's forces can mount a successful
forward defence of likely landing sites on the island, making a
protracted defence and the subsequent flow of US forces superfluous. If
not, the battle will likely end before either of these things can be
considered. This does, in principle, mean that assets such as MLRS
equipped with cluster munitions and land-centric capabilities such as
heavy armour would be likely to be free for the European theatre, where
they have far greater relevance against a primarily ground-based Russian
threat, in tandem with the forces already under V Corps in Poland. The
scope and scale of this threat will depend on a number of factors, among
which are the question of whether Russia can free its forces from their
existing commitments in Ukraine, and whether the Russian military can
achieve its aspiration to stand up two new military districts and 14 new
divisions, in accordance with the plans laid out by former defence
minister Sergei Shoigu.160 This will prove challenging, as Russia has
expended much of its stock of Soviet-era equipment and has, since 2008,
shuttered many of the training academies for its officer corps as part
of former defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov's reforms.161 Nevertheless,
the pace of Russian reconstitution in many areas makes the availability
of a Russian ground force comparable to the one that invaded Ukraine on
24 February 2022 plausible enough to bear consideration. Specific land
capabilities, such as deep-strike missiles like the PrSM and the ATACMS,
may have greater cross-theatre relevance, as they can be used to strike

vessels in port or even to contribute to counter-airbase missions.
However, [while the possession of these missiles by Taiwan at the outset
of a conflict may be relevant, it is unlikely that the US will be able
to ship additional missiles to Taiwan under contested conditions, and
most ground-based fires, with the exception of the US Army's
intermediate-range hypersonics, largely lack the reach to strike China
from anywhere else in the first island chain.162 The major bottlenecks
in the deployment of the US Army to Europe would probably be in the
areas of air defence and logistical support.]{.underline} Since the US
Army is responsible for air defence as a function of the Key West
Agreement, it would likely see its air-defence capabilities entirely
consumed by a Pacific war.163 Any US Army deployment to Europe would
thus depend on the availability of adequate European air defences
(without which ground forces could not deploy). US strategic sealift
would necessarily be strained by a Pacific deployment, and some of this
capability will be provided by the US Army.164 At the time of writing,
there is limited European capacity to provide strategic sealift, as the
movement of US forces across the Atlantic has largely been a US
activity. [NATO maintains a sealift consortium]{.underline}, to which 11
countries contribute 15 vessels, [but this represents a limited
capability]{.underline}.165 Airlift may represent another means of
providing inter-theatre mobility to US forces, as during the Cold War,
although this will likely only partially mitigate bottlenecks in
mobility.166 In effect, while many components of US land power may in
principle remain available for use in Europe -- if policy allows -- even
in the face of an Indo-Pacific contingency, this depends to a
considerable degree on the ability of European states to fill gaps in
key enablers that allow a ground force to both cross the Atlantic and
remain safe against a range of air and missile threats while in theatre.
