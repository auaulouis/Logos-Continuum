# Native Climate Adaptation Aff

### Notes

This aff has potential. I feel like I only scratched the surface of the
literature. There are many proposals and ways to write the affirmative.

The plan proposes an increase in "collaborative" climate adaptation
infrastructure development. The way you should explain this is that the
federal government has to send agency members (from the Denali
Commission, a federal agency based in Anchorage that has the sole
purpose of promoting rural development in Alaska) to Native Alaskan
villages in the Arctic to:

\--provide technical assistance for applying for federal grants for
development projects

\--to solicit community input about what they want or need for climate
adaptation

\--to provide funding (and land) for relocation if the community demands
relocation

\--to remove barriers to funding, such as matching requirements that
require poor communities to provide a portion of the funds

Basically, whatever the Alaskan village asks for related to climate
adaptation, they'd get.

The plan also names the Denali Commission as the lead agency and
attributes prior failures in adaptation assistance to a lack of having a
lead federal agency.

#### Framing

I ran out of time to do this. So I used the framing cards from last
year's Communal Copyright Aff turned out at the Michigan camp.
Otherwise, the work here is original.

#### Negative arguments

The most threatening negative argument is the colonialism K -- if you're
going to read this aff, you need to think about that argument the most
and write blocks.

#### Contention 1 is climate change

#### 144 Alaskan Native communities are facing severe infrastructure damage from permafrost melt, erosion and flooding. Federal barriers to accessing land and funding constraints threaten their existence

[[Alaska is warming]{.mark} two to [three times faster]{.mark} than the
global average. Some villages dotting the usually frigid North
Slope]{.underline}, Alaska's prodigious oil field, [had their warmest
temperatures on record]{.underline} in August, prompting some of Ashley
Tom's friends living there to don bikinis and head to Arctic Ocean
beaches.

It's the same story across the Arctic, with permafrost degradation
damaging roads, railroad tracks, pipes and buildings for 4 million
people across the top of the world, according to the Washington,
D.C.-based Arctic Institute. In the Russian Arctic, Indigenous people
are being moved to cities instead of having their eroding villages
relocated and across Scandinavia, reindeer herders are finding the land
constantly shifting and new bodies of water appearing, the institute
said.

About [[85% of Alaska]{.mark}'s land area [lies atop
permafrost]{.mark},]{.underline} so named because it's supposed to be
permanently frozen ground. It holds a lot of water, and when it thaws or
when warmer coastal water hits it, its melting causes further erosion.
Another issue with warming: less sea ice to act as natural barriers that
protect coastal communities from the dangerous waves of ocean storms.

[[The Yupik have a word for the catastrophic threats of erosion,
flooding and thawing permafrost: "usteq]{.underline}]{.mark}," [[which
means "surface caves in." The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[changes are usually
slow --- until all of a sudden they aren't, as when a riverbank sloughs
off or a huge hole opens up]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Rick Thoman, a
climate specialist with the International Arctic Research Center at the
University of Alaska Fairbanks.

[[There are 144 Alaska Native communities]{.mark} that face some degree
of [infrastructure damage from erosion, flooding or permafrost
melt]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a report in January from the the
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. Six of them --- Kivalina,
Koyukuk, Newtok, Shaktoolik, Shishmaref and Unalakleet --- were deemed
imminently threatened in a Government Accountability Office report more
than two decades ago.

[[Communities have three options]{.mark} based on the severity of their
situations: [Securing protection to stay]{.mark} where they are;
[staging a managed retreat]{.mark}, moving back from erosion threats;
[or a complete relocation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Moving is hard, starting with finding a place to go.
Communities]{.mark} typically **[need to swap with the federal
government,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[which owns]{.underline}]{.mark}
about [[60% of Alaska's land]{.mark}. [But Congress has to approve
swaps]{.mark}, and that's only [after negotiations that can drag
on]{.mark}]{.underline}: Newtok, for example, began pursuing the Nelson
Island land in 1996 and didn't wrap up until late 2003.

"That's way too long," said Jackie Qatalina Schaeffer, the director of
climate initiatives at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.

"If we look back a decade at what's happened [[as far as climate change
in Alaska, **we're out of time**]{.underline}]{.mark}," she said. "[We
need to find a better way to help communities secure land for
relocation.]{.underline}"

Kivalina last year completed a master plan for relocation and is
negotiating with an Alaska Native regional corporation for the land, a
process that could take 3 to 5 years, Schaeffer said.

[[Another]{.mark} big hurdle [is cost. Newtok has spent decades
and]{.mark}]{.underline} about [[\$160 million]{.underline}]{.mark} in
today's dollars [[on its move]{.mark}. [Estimates to relocate
Kivalina]{.mark} vary from \$100 million to \$[400 million and]{.mark}
[rising, and there's]{.mark} currently **[no federal funding for
relocation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Federal Emergency Management
Agency has disaster funding and programs, Schaeffer said, but that comes
only after a disaster declaration.

In 2018, a resource for Alaska communities identified 60 federal funding
sources for relocation, but according to the Unmet Needs report, only a
few have been successfully used to address environmental threats. But an
infusion of funding into these existing programs by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act could provide
benefits to threatened Alaska communities, the report said.

About \$[[4.3 billion]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2020 dollars [[will be
needed to mitigate infrastructure damage]{.underline}]{.mark} over the
next 50 years, the health consortium report says. It called for Congress
to close an \$80 million annual gap by providing a single committed
source to assist communities.

"[[Alaska Native economic, social, and cultural ways of]{.mark}
[being]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have served so well for millennia,
[[are now under extreme threat]{.mark} due to accelerated environmental
change]{.underline}," the report said. [["In jeopardy are not just
buildings, but the **sustainability of entire communities and
cultures**."]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Vulnerability to climate change is [inextricably]{.underline} linked to the colonial history of Alaska where the federal government forced mobile communities to settle in precarious locations.

[There are 229 federally recognized Tribes in Alaska]{.underline}, each
of which has a nation-to-nation relationship with the United States
(Case and Voluck 2002; US Government Accountability Office 2022). Most
of these Tribes are associated with a single Alaska Native village,
small communities with fewer than 1,000 residents. These communities are
distributed across the state, itself an area three times the size of
France. [Most]{.underline} villages [are not connected to the North
American road system and are accessed instead by a combination of small
airplanes, snowmobiles, and boats.]{.underline}

[[Alaska Native communities]{.underline}]{.mark} are the traditional
stewards of millions of acres of land and water, encompassing tundra,
coastal rainforest, boreal forest, marine ecosystems, and broad river
deltas. They also [[face]{.underline}]{.mark} some of [[the most urgent
threats from environmental change]{.mark} of any region in
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [[Rising
seas, melting permafrost, intensifying storms, reductions in sea ice,
and changes to the availability of]{.mark} plants and animals harvested
for [subsistence]{.mark} have [created dire threats for many of these
communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} One report by the federal government
identifies that the majority of these villages are affected by flooding
and erosion (US Government Accountability Office 2009).

[[These environmental hazards are **inextricably linked to the colonial
history** of Alaska Native villages]{.underline}]{.mark}. Until the late
19th or early 20th centuries, many contemporary village sites were
inhabited only seasonally (Berardi 1999; Berger 1985). Before then,
[[Alaska Native communities practiced a form of seasonal
mobility]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many Iñupiat, for instance, spent the
winters and springs close to frozen shorelines or rivers and then moved
to higher ground in the summers and autumns. [When [the US colonial
government]{.mark} tightened its grip on Alaska at the turn of the 20th
century, it [forced Alaska Natives to remain in one place for the
majority of each year by building schools and mandating that children
attend them]{.mark}]{.underline} (Berardi 1999; Hirshberg 2008). These
schools, along with churches and other buildings, were erected hastily
by visiting Non-Native workers, most of whom arrived by boat and began
construction close to the landing site for convenience. [[As a
result,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[many Alaska Native villages today are
located on barrier islands, sand spits, or immediately astride
rivers]{.underline}]{.mark} \[Marino 2012[). [Traditional]{.mark}
technologies of [environmental adaptation and mobility were
replaced]{.mark} over a short period of generations [by a]{.mark} more
[sedentary existence]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Many Alaska Natives still
practice some seasonal mobility, for example, by visiting "fish camp" in
the summer, away from village centers (Berardi 1999; Deur et al. 2018;
Hirshberg 2008; Johnson et al. 2021)\].

[[From the outset, environmental hazards posed an **existential threat**
to many of these communities]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Iñupiat villages
of Shaktoolik and Point Hope relocated to higher ground in 1975 and
1977, respectively (Johnson and Gray 2014; Sakakibara 2008); both
villages are now faced with the prospect of relocating for a second time
(GAO 2009). Across the state, [[Alaska Native villages were made
vulnerable by historical processes, recently exacerbated by climatic
factor]{.mark}s]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021). A report by the
US Government Accountability Office (GAO), a public agency and
self-described watchdog of the federal government, succinctly summarizes
this history: "In many cases, [[Native villages occupy their current
precarious locations because the federal government built schools
in]{.mark} what were [seasonal encampments]{.mark} and mandated that
Alaska Native children attend those schools]{.underline}" (US GAO, 2022:
7).

In 2009, the GAO government identified 31 Alaska Native villages facing
"imminent threats" from climate change, for which wholesale relocation
may be required in the medium-term future. In the time since, just two
Alaska Native villages, Newtok and Kivalina, have begun the process of
building infrastructure in a designated relocation site. Of those two,
only the community of Newtok has built and occupied homes at the new
site (Schwing 2023b).

#### Degradation of the land is creating widespread psychological and physical violence on Alaskan Native communities. The lack of federal support exacerbates the trauma as communities are forced to relocate

Ishfaq Hussain **Malik and** James D **Ford**, 20**25** -- both from the
School of Geography, University of Leeds, Leeds. "Barriers and limits to
adaptation in the Arctic" Current Opinion in Environmental
Sustainability, April,
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343525000120>
//DH

[As climate change alters the Arctic environment, [many Indigenous
communities are forced to shift away from traditional subsistence
practices,]{.mark} [leading to increased dependence on expensive
technologies for food gathering, imported foods, and
fuel]{.mark}]{.underline} \[76\]. [The reliance on technologies such as
high-efficiency snowmobiles and gasoline for
transportation]{.underline}, advanced fishing equipment and boats for
food gathering and travelling, and GPS systems and satellite phones for
navigation [has increased]{.underline} 20••, 23, 84. However[,
[buying]{.mark} these technologies [is costly, imposing a significant
social and financial strain on communities and creating social
inequities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This is exacerbated by]{.mark} an
increased reliance on expensive store-bought foods, a high cost of
living, and [dependence on global markets]{.mark} and price
fluctuations]{.underline} \[••65\]. This economic shift presents a
barrier for lower-income households that cannot afford adaptation costs,
as well as a limit for communities that have surpassed economic
feasibility thresholds.

[Inability to adapt due to financial constraints presents a significant
limit to adaptation]{.underline}. In Chukotka, Russia, many Indigenous
communities live in poverty, with limited access to resources and
infrastructure \[53\]. This financial constraint creates a limit to
adaptation, as communities cannot afford the technologies or
infrastructure needed to cope with climate change. The limited mobility
due to fixed settlements acts as a limit. [[In Alaska, many Indigenous
communities were **forcibly relocated to fixed
settlements**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[These]{.mark} settlements [are now
vulnerable to rising sea levels and permafrost thaw, limiting the
ability of communities to adapt through traditional mobility]{.mark}
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline} 25, 51.

Psychosocial factors

[[Psychosocial factors such as cultural alienation, mental health
struggles, intergenerational disconnect,]{.mark} and loss of trust in
institutions [shape how Arctic Indigenous communities]{.mark} perceive,
engage with, and [respond to climate change]{.mark}. [Indigenous
communities face **historical trauma of forced displacement**]{.mark}
and cultural alienation]{.underline} \[88\]. [[Many]{.mark} Indigenous
communities [are facing]{.mark} the threat of [climate-induced
relocation,]{.mark} as coastal erosion, permafrost thawing, and extreme
weather events threaten settlements that have existed for
generations]{.underline} 12, 51. However, [[relocation]{.mark} is not
just a physical challenge --- it [represents a rupture in cultural
continuity, identity, and psychological well-being.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[In Alaska, the communities of Shishmaref, Newtok, and Kivalina, are
**facing forced relocation** due to rising sea levels and coastal
erosion]{.underline}]{.mark} 25, 9. For many community members, [[this
displacement]{.mark} represents more than just losing a home --- it
[means losing a way of life, severing their spiritual and cultural ties
to the land]{.mark}]{.underline} \[71\]. In Siberia, Indigenous Evenki
and Nenets herders face disruptions to traditional migration routes due
to industrial expansion and resource extraction \[96\]. These changes
force some herders into fixed settlements, where they experience high
levels of psychological distress and increased dependency on state
welfare systems \[52\]. This psychological trauma represents an
adaptation limit --- once the connection to land is severed, a
fundamental part of Indigenous identity is lost.

[[Socioeconomic inequalities, poverty, income disparities, and access to
resources create barriers and lead to lower social well-being, affecting
access to health care, food, housing, basic needs, education, and skill
development in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} 16, 39, 6, 83.
Traditional livelihoods are increasingly becoming unsustainable and
creating barriers for economically disadvantaged households dependent on
them 80, 89. These [[inequities are **exacerbated by systemic issues**
such as social marginalisation, **inadequate infrastructure**, and
**limited government support**]{.underline}]{.mark} (at national to
regional levels).

[Climate change has affected social networks by impacting hunting and
herding, availability of traditional foods, and high costs associated
with accessing these foods]{.underline} 38••, 50. This has been
complicated by a reduction in the number of wildlife that are culturally
important to the communities. Food insecurity is a growing crisis in
many Arctic regions, exacerbating mental health issues \[56\]. For
example, the decline in the number of caribou in the Canadian Arctic has
affected food security, traditional knowledge, mental health, cultural
continuity, and the transmission of skills across the generations,
compounded by the high costs of substitute foods \[8\]. This loss of
communal food security creates chronic stress, anxiety, and depression,
particularly for older generations who struggle to adjust to these
shifts \[72\]. These mental health challenges act as a barrier to
adaptation, as they reduce the capacity of individuals and communities
to respond effectively to environmental changes. Indigenous communities
face high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health
issues, largely due to nutritional transitions from traditional diets to
processed store-bought foods and financial constraints 99, 58. These
health issues reduce the adaptive capacity of individuals. This
represents both a barrier and a limit. Food insecurity and health
disparities that arise from climate-induced changes in wildlife
availability represent limits, particularly for subsistence-dependent
communities.

[Many Indigenous Peoples experience a sense of loss, anxiety, and
uncertainty about the future]{.underline} \[56\]. [[In the North
American Arctic, the loss of sea ice has led to 'ecological
grief']{.mark}, where individuals mourn the disappearance of traditional
landscapes, loss of cultural practices, [and **uncertainty about their
community's long-term survival**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[15\]. This
psychological burden represents an adaptation limit, as policy
interventions cannot reverse existential grief tied to irreversible
ecological loss.

#### Climate change risks the annihilation, starvation and homelessness of Native Alaskan communities

[[Damage to infrastructure and the contamination of]{.mark} main [food
supplies are]{.mark} just two of the many [negative effects of global
warming]{.mark}]{.underline} and the melting of sea ice [on remote
northern communities. [Alaska Natives' subsistence culture is being
threatened by the decline in Arctic sea ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has made it more challenging to travel and hunt throughout the winter
months and gather the necessary resources and food required for survival
(Brown et al., 2018).

Between 2002 and 2017, [[the Yup'ik indigenous people of
Newtok]{.underline}]{.mark}, a coastal settlement in western Alaska,
[were confronted with substantial difficulties stemming from
climate-related change.]{.underline} During this time, six significant
storms exacerbated erosion and permafrost degradation by flooding the
village's water supply and spreading untreated sewage throughout the
community. Because of these natural disasters, [residents [were
compelled to evacuate their homes, which led to losing their food
supplies and suspending services necessary for
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Having a safe place]{.mark} [individuals can call home]{.mark} and
feel comfortable [is essential to]{.mark} their [health and
well-being]{.mark}. Newtok has been striving to get its constituents out
of the path of climate change for]{.underline} over a handful of y[ears,
but neither the state nor the federal government can help communities in
flood-prone regions relocate, restore, or improve infrastructure in the
aftermath of natural disasters]{.underline} (Bronen, 2021; Chapin et
al., 2022). Other Alaskan communities, such as Shishmaref, Quinhagak,
and Kivalina, have encountered the same difficulty in relocating their
inhabitants and have been unsuccessful.

[As a result of climate change, [31 indigenous communities could be
**forcibly displaced**, and 184 of the state's 213 rural communities
could be obliterated due to flooding and erosion, resulting in increased
homelessness and cultural loss]{.mark}]{.underline} (Norton Smith et
al., 2016). Alaska Natives have thrived for millennia due to centuries
of keen observation and intimate engagement with their natural
surroundings; however, [[climate-related circumstances have led to
significant population loss due to factors such as famine or starvation,
the spread of disease, relocation, and homelessness]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Brown et al., 2018; Hensley et al., 2018; Hueffer et al., 2019).

### 1ac -- federal assistance

#### Contention 2 is federal assistance

#### Low levels of federal adaptation assistance, barriers to grants, and lack of community collaboration make Alaskan Native villages feel [abandoned]{.underline} and [marginalized]{.underline}

Despite a torrent of media attention (Bennett 2021; Herrmann 2019;
Marino 2012), [[many rural Alaska Natives continue to **feel
abandoned**]{.mark} [and **marginalized**]{.mark} [by a "distant
bureaucracy]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Marino and Ribot 2012[).
[Systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [that are putatively [designed to aid
these communities, such as federal grant programs]{.mark}, often
**[prove to be inaccessible,]{.mark}** [or navigable only with the
assistance of professional grant writers]{.mark} and civil
engineers]{.underline}. [The fundamental principle of
[self-determination]{.mark} --- which is critical to effective Alaska
Native government]{.underline} (Cornell and Kalt 2003) --- [[is
complicated by a bureaucracy that is broadly out of step with the
administrative capacity of small sovereign communities]{.mark},
Indigenous or settler.]{.underline} In 2020, [the Alaska Federation of
Natives approved a resolution stating, "The regulations and requirements
of most federal programs, including FEMA and the Army Corps of
Engineers, are developed for the contiguous United States \[i.e.,
excluding Alaska\]. By design, they prevent vital resources from being
available to our communities]{.underline}" (Increased Coordination
2020).

To date, [[the federal government's response]{.mark} to environmental
change in Alaska Native villages [has been]{.mark}, by its own
admission[, **inadequately coordinated** and
**underfunded**]{.mark}]{.underline} (US GAO, 2022). Several [reports by
the GAO have pointed to these failures and recommended pathways for
change, many of which do not require acts of Congress and could be
enacted through executive and agency action]{.underline} (US Government
Accountability Office 2003, 2009, 2020, 2022). These recommendations,
and the principles underlying them, are echoed in other government
publications (Status of Tribes and Climate Change 2021; 2018 National
Climate Assessment, Ch. 15). A number of academic publications have also
pointed to shortcomings and pitfalls in current systems (Bergstrom et
al. 2022; Bronen and Chapin 2013; Marino 2012, 2015; Pennington 2023;
Ristroph 2017, 2021; Shearer 2012).

[Some of the most frequently cited [barriers to environmental adaptation
include]{.mark}]{.underline} (1) [[the high cost of construction in
rural Alaska, where]{.mark} the estimated of [relocating a single
village exceeds US\$100 million]{.mark} in many instances]{.underline}
(US Army Corps of Engineers, Alaska District 2006); [(2) [a lack of
funding allocated to Alaska Native communities]{.mark} by government
entities [relative to the need for **infrastructure
development**]{.mark}; (3) [poor coordination]{.mark} between a
multitude of federal agencies with overlapping mandates; [and]{.mark}
(4) [barriers to accessing federal funds]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g.,
[[through cost matching requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These are policy issues. But [behind these hurdles is a historical and
cultural backdrop of fraught engagement that creates chronic obstacles
to Alaska Native governments partnering with federal agencies with the
capacity to fund infrastructure-scale projects]{.underline}. [The
friction of working collaboratively across a vast geographic and
cultural distance, from rural Alaska to Washington, D.C., underpins the
feeling of disenfranchisement in village communities]{.underline}. [This
leads to poor engagement and coordination, undermining service delivery
and disparaging the "trust responsibility]{.underline}" (Case and Voluck
2002) [that the federal government has with Alaska Native
communities]{.underline}.

#### Barriers to assistance [replicate colonialism]{.underline} -- Native communities are forced to adapt to rigid federal rules and hire outside consultants to apply for adaptation assistance

Stephen **Lezak and** Genevieve **Rock**, 20**24** -- \*Scott Polar

**Italics in original**

In the existing academic and government literature, commonly [[proposed
interventions to improve the delivery of environmental
assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} are well-informed and urgent. But these
recommendations sometimes [[fall short of engaging]{.mark} the more
mundane and [micropolitical barriers to effective collaboration
with]{.mark} Indigenous communities, such as [Alaska Native
villages]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Issues that seem distant from federal
offices in]{.mark} Washington, [DC, can pose significant challenges in
rural Alaska]{.mark}. These include, for example, intermittent Internet
access, English spoken as a second language, misaligned expectations
around trust and relationship-building]{.underline} (Whyte 2020), and
the need to spend days to weeks at a time away from village centers to
fish and hunt (Marino 2015). [Effectively assisting with environmental
adaptation]{.underline}---and indeed, any issue---[in rural Alaska
requires attending to these place-based and culturally-specific
dimensions, and the micropolitics that arise between them.]{.underline}

A list of micropolitical barriers, with examples and exceptions, is
presented in Table 1. Neither the list, nor the exceptions, are
exhaustive. Table 2 presents a list of non-micropolitical barriers ---
also non-exhaustively.

[Alaska Native villages face micropolitical barriers to successfully
engaging federal programs even when those programs]{.underline} (e.g.,
those within the Bureau of Indian Affairs) [are specifically designed to
render aid to Indigenous communities.]{.underline} Often, these barriers
are technological, cultural, or pragmatic in ways that are not legible
(Scott 2008) to agency staff in cities in the Lower 48. [These barriers
are *micropolitical* because they are not readily visible to
policymakers but nevertheless pose major challenges in the practice of
policy execution]{.underline} and service delivery.

In this case, [micropolitics is about the *conduct* of government rather
than its overarching goals. As such, they are easily overlooked or even
ignored by high-level officials in Congress and the agencies tasked with
delivering services]{.underline}. Nevertheless, they underlie the
conditions for success or failure in many communities, as was the case
following Typhoon Merbok.

For example, many [[Tribal leaders are limited in their capacity to
manage a bureaucratic landscape of tools that are required for
successful funding applications]{.underline}.]{.mark} This includes, for
instance, the often-cited SAMS.gov website that is required for federal
funding and procurement. As a result of these complicated systems,
[[some small villages]{.mark} are [only]{.mark} able to [succeed]{.mark}
in applying for federal assistance [by hiring outside
consultants]{.mark} [who can navigate the labyrinth of bureaucracy
involved in federal funding]{.mark}]{.underline}. For a glimpse of the
challenge, navigate to www.grants.gov to see the web portal through
which most federal grant applications are submitted. Despite the evident
best intentions, the portal is a complex maze of information best suited
to specialists. The creation of several different "technical assistance
centers" or "adaptation centers" has helped some communities overcome
these hurdles, but the reliance upon outside experts may still impinge
upon communities' capacity to exercise self-determination by
articulating their needs in nontechnical language.

Individually, several of these challenges have also been identified by
other researchers. But brought together, [[this]{.mark} pattern of
seemingly mundane obstacles [may]{.mark} collectively [disenfranchise
many Alaska Native villages.]{.mark} Micropolitics function by rewarding
those communities that are best able to succeed within externally
imposed colonial structures. As a result, [Alaska Native communities are
subjected to a particular form of neoliberal and colonial
governmentality]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014), [[whereby their
consideration for funding is made contingent upon adopting an
externally-imposed political subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}---[for
example, as clients of engineering firms and grant-writing specialists
who are fluent in the institutional language of metric tons and dollars.
To receive aid, Alaska Native communities are pressured to adopt the
bureaucratic language and governmental forms of their
colonizers]{.underline}.

This form of governmentality echoes what Agrawal terms "the soft hammer
of self-regulation" (Agrawal 2005; p. 15). [When micropolitics are
unacknowledged, [Alaska Native communities]{.mark} and Tribes [are
framed as responsible for a lack of competitive funding applications,
**absolving federal agencies of the need to actively render
assistance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When grantmaking is too
onerous]{.mark}, or calls and emails to federal agencies are not
returned]{.underline} (or are only returned once, perhaps when the local
cell towers are down), [[the blame is]{.mark} readily [shifted onto
already-disenfranchised communities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[As Alaska Native communities struggle to overcome these micropolitical
barriers, "capacity building" has emerged as a solution that positions
Native communities as a broken element in an otherwise-functioning
institutional meshwork. But this narrative risks overlooking the
consequences of historical violence and oppression]{.underline}, [and
may imply that communities are responsible for their own success or
failure as they apply to---rather than
*demand*---assistance]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021; Marino and
Ribot 2012).

[[These issues impinge upon communities' ability to **make demands upon
systems of power**]{.mark} [and to **access resources**;]{.mark} this is
where the *politics*]{.underline} ([relating to *power*) of
micropolitics come into play. Micropolitics privileges certain
communities and disenfranchises others in a way that has limited
correspondence to need or merit]{.underline}.

[[In rural Alaska Native villages, community]{.underline}]{.mark}

through a highly technical language and practice of bureaucracy that

themselves** and **become better colonial subjects**]{.mark} in order
[to be considered for aid]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Newtok, the one village that received some relocation assistance, faces a [catastrophic]{.underline} lack of infrastructure and dilapidated homes due to [federal failures]{.underline} in collaboration

Emily **Schwing and** Ash **Adams**, 20**25** -- journalists "Forced to
relocate by climate change, Alaskan villagers found a new crisis"
Washington Post, 6/1, Forced to relocate by climate change, Alaskan
villagers found a new crisis" //DH

A jumble of shipping containers hold all that remains of the demolished
public school in Newtok, Alaska, where on a recent visit, a few stray
dogs and a lone ermine prowled among the ruins.

Late last year, the final residents of this sinking village near the
Bering Sea left behind the waterlogged tundra of their former home, part
of a fraught, federally funded effort to resettle communities threatened
by climate change.

Nearly [[300 people from Newtok]{.mark} have [moved]{.mark}]{.underline}
nine miles across the Ninglick River [[to a new village known as
Mertarvik]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[much of the infrastructure there
is **already failing.**]{.underline} [Residents lack running water, use
5-gallon buckets as toilets and must contend with intermittent
electricity and deteriorating homes]{.underline}]{.mark} [that expose
them to the region\'s fierce weather]{.underline}.

[[Newtok\'s relocation was supposed to provide a model for dozens of
Alaskan communities]{.mark} that will need to move]{.underline} in the
coming decades. Instead, those who\'ve worked on the effort say [[what
happened in Newtok demonstrates the federal government\'s **failure to
oversee the complex project**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and understand
communities\' unique cultural needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. And it
highlights how ill-prepared the United States is to respond to the way
climate change is making some places uninhabitable, according to an
investigation by The Washington Post, ProPublica and KYUK radio in
Bethel, Alaska.

Dozens of grants from at least seven federal agencies have helped pay
for the relocation, which began in 2019 and is expected to cost more
than \$150 million. But while the federal government supplied taxpayer
dollars, it left most of the responsibility for the move to the tiny
[[Newtok]{.underline}]{.mark} Village Council. The federally recognized
tribal government [[lacked the expertise to manage the project and has
faced high turnover and internal political
conflict]{.underline},]{.mark} according to tribal records and
interviews with more than 70 residents as well as dozens of current and
former members of the seven-person village council.

[[Federal auditors have warned for years that climate relocation
projects need a **lead agency to coordinate assistance**]{.mark} [and
reduce the burden on local communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Biden
administration tried to address those concerns by creating an
interagency task force led by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
and the Interior Department. The task force\'s report in December also
called for more coordination and guidance across the federal government
as well as long-term funding for relocations.

But the Trump administration has removed the report from FEMA\'s website
and, as part of its withdrawal of climate funding, frozen millions in
federal aid that was supposed to pay for housing construction in
Mertarvik this summer. The administration did not respond to a request
for comment.

\"We\'re physically seeing the impacts of a changing climate on these
communities,\" said Don Antrobus, a climate adaptation consultant for
the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. \"And the fact that we
don\'t have a government framework for dealing with these issues is not
just an Alaska problem, it\'s a national problem.\"

Newtok\'s relocation follows the resettlement of Isle de Jean Charles,
Louisiana, where land vanished under rising sea levels. Both
[[relocations have been]{.underline}]{.mark} labeled \"blueprints\" for
the federal government\'s response to climate change. Both have been
[[mired in complicated and disjointed funding systems and accusations
that the government neglected traditional
knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For centuries, the area\'s Indigenous Yup\'ik residents lived a nomadic
subsistence lifestyle, timing their seasonal movements with the arrival
of migratory birds in spring, fish in summer and the ripening of berries
in early fall. But that changed in the 1950s after a barge, loaded with
construction materials to build a school, got stuck near present-day
Newtok and couldn\'t navigate farther upriver. So the Bureau of Indian
Affairs built the school there.

At the time, elders knew the location wasn\'t fit for permanent
settlement because the low-lying ground would shift as the permafrost
froze and thawed seasonally, said Andy Patrick, 77, one of two residents
who remember life in the old village before Newtok.

\"My grandma used to tell me \'It\'s going to start wobbling,\'\" he
said. But they moved because the BIA required their children to attend
its school.

Born and raised in Newtok, Jack Charlie was relieved when he moved into
a modest brown house in Mertarvik in 2022. His old plywood home in
Newtok was moldy and sinking into the tundra as the permafrost that
supported the land thawed.

But within months, the light fixtures in his new house filled with water
from condensation, and gaps formed where the walls met the ceiling in
his bedroom. Charlie started stuffing toilet paper into the cracks to
keep out the persistent coastal winds.

\"Once I found it was leaking and cold air drifting in, I said: \'Hell!
What kind of house did they build?\'\" he said.

Charlie is one of multiple residents who complained about problems with
their newly built houses. When KYUK asked for inspection reports, the
tribe and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said they
didn\'t have any. In the absence of an official inspection, KYUK hired a
professional with expertise in cold climate housing to examine seven of
the 46 homes, which were built by three different contractors, in
Mertarvik.

According to the inspection performed last year, Charlie\'s home is
among [17 houses]{.underline}, built by one contractor, that are rapidly
deteriorating because they were all designed and constructed the same
way. The foundations [are not salvageable, and the buildings do not meet
minimum code requirements]{.underline}, said the inspector, Emmett
Leffel, an energy auditor and building analyst in Alaska.

\"This is some of the worst new construction I\'ve ever seen, and the
impact is so quickly realized because of the coastal climate,\" Leffel
said in an interview.

His inspection report concluded: \"The totality of the work needed to
correct these conditions and issues may cost substantially more than the
original construction.\"

There are other problems beyond housing. The [BIA committed]{.underline}
more than \$[6 million for roads but failed to coordinate with other
agencies to install water pipes]{.underline} underneath, according to a
former project manager, the tribal health consortium and the Denali
Commission, an independent federal agency tasked with providing critical
infrastructure support to Alaska\'s most remote communities. As a
result, none of the houses in Mertarvik has a flush toilet or shower.
Residents go to the town\'s small well to fill jugs for household use.

As more people have moved to Mertarvik, [[the town\'s power plant
hasn\'t kept up with electricity demand, leaving residents **without
heat or power in the winter**]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Calvin Tom, the
tribal administrator. And a wastewater system that handles sewage from
the school, health clinic and a dormitory for construction workers has
been overwhelmed for more than a year, he said. Last spring, sewage
backed up into the school\'s basement.

The BIA, the largest funder of the relocation that helped plan the
community, did not agree to an interview request. The agency said in an
email that it\'s working closely with the Newtok Village Council and
that the council has established a plan to repair the homes. The
tribe\'s attorney, Matt Mead, said, \"NVC does have a repair plan and is
seeking funding from multiple sources to allow for implementation of the
plan.\"

That was news to council secretary Della Carl and council member Francis
Tom, whose home has some of the worst problems. Both said they knew of
no such plan, and Mead declined to provide one. Four other council
members (one seat is vacant) declined to comment or didn\'t return calls
or emails. Mead said the plan to fix the houses needs to be better
communicated to council members and residents. He said the tribe
disagrees that the homes are deteriorating and declined to comment about
its management of the project.

Patrick LeMay, the Anchorage-based contractor whose company was hired by
the tribe to build Charlie\'s and 16 other deteriorating houses, was
fired last year because of the construction and design problems,
according to tribal council members. LeMay didn\'t respond to questions
or comment on Leffel\'s report other than to say, \"I do not work for
Newtok any longer.\"

Greg Stuckey, administrator for HUD\'s Office of Native American
Programs in Anchorage, said the agency is not required to inspect the
LeMay houses because the grant went directly to the tribal government.
Federal law allows tribes to administer government programs themselves
to recognize their independence and cultural needs.

\"So they can\'t say it\'s the federal government,\" Stuckey said,
\"because they chose this.\"

Mead said the Newtok Village Council didn\'t dispute that.

[The [G]{.mark}overnment [A]{.mark}ccountability
[O]{.mark}ffice]{.underline}, however, has [repeatedly [recommended that
federal agencies provide more technical assistance to small tribes in
climate relocations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"When you have 20 or 30 different programs that can all interact
together and they all have different rules,\" said Anna Maria Ortiz,
GAO\'s director of natural resources and environment, \"that\'s going to
cost more in the long run and can be nearly impossible for some
villages.\"

In 1996, after decades fighting erosion from storms and the
deteriorating permafrost, the Newtok tribe began negotiating with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to exchange land for the relocation.
Congress approved the trade in 2003. For the next two decades, the tribe
worked with federal and state agencies to plan the new community at
Mertarvik. Storm damage shut down the public school for good last year,
and the Newtok Village Council voted to finish the evacuation.

Dozens of remote communities in Alaska face similar threats from climate
change, according to a 2019 report by the University of Alaska at
Fairbanks and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The issues affecting
such communities are well understood in Arctic regions around the world,
but policymakers aren\'t heeding warnings from relocation experts, said
Andrea Marta Knudsen, a relocation and disaster recovery specialist in
the Iceland prime minister\'s office.

\"It\'s not like this is a new thing or hasn\'t been researched,\" she
said. \"The government should maybe say, \'Oh wow, we\'re dealing with a
disaster or relocation. Who knows this? Let\'s have a team of experts
working with the government on this.\'\"

Over the years, several government bodies tried to coordinate efforts in
Newtok. At first, Alaska\'s commerce department formed the Newtok
Planning Group to coordinate assistance for the relocation. But in 2013,
the group\'s work stalled because the BIA paused its funding for the
tribe after a political dispute resulted in two competing tribal
governments. The planning group has met only three times since 2019.

[[The Denali Commission took on project management responsibilities in
2016 but ceded control to the BIA]{.mark} three years ago]{.underline}
after the agency announced a \$25 million grant funded by the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law.

[[**This inconsistent oversight** **and coordination** has significantly
affected the quality of housing]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
experts who have worked on the relocation.

The first two housing projects in Mertarvik received high ratings from
Leffel, the inspector hired by KYUK. The Alaska-based nonprofit Cold
Climate Housing Research Center designed 14 homes to maximize energy
efficiency and withstand the harsh weather. The houses also provide
space for residents to cut fish, dress moose and host large family
gatherings - activities integral to the Yup\'ik lifestyle. An additional
15 houses were built by a regional housing authority that has decades of
experience on Alaska\'s Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.

Charlie\'s home and 16 others were part of a third round of houses,
designed and built by LeMay Engineering & Consulting. At various times,
LeMay was also employed by the tribe in other roles, including tribal
administrator and relocation coordinator. Representing the tribe while
simultaneously earning money from it could create a potential conflict
of interest, said Ted Waters, an attorney who specializes in federal
grants administration.

According to Leffel\'s inspection, the foundations of Charlie\'s home
and the others designed and built by LeMay \"do not meet minimum code
requirements for corrosion resistance, adequate supports\" or
\"structural integrity requirements.\" Two years of fuel usage data
provided by the tribe shows residents in the LeMay houses pay more than
twice as much for energy each year compared with the other two housing
projects.

Francis Tom, the council member, said outside entities like LeMay and
[[federal agencies often ignored his community\'s
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}. \"They don\'t know. They weren\'t born
here,\" he said. \"[[They don\'t spend enough time
here.]{.underline}\"]{.mark}

A year before Leffel examined the houses, a group of BIA officials took
a tour and saw the water pooling in light fixtures and moisture damage
in several of the LeMay homes, council members said. It\'s unclear what
they did with that information. The BIA said its staff has made three
trips to Mertarvik since, and the tribe\'s attorney said multiple homes
were inspected by independent engineers this past year, something both
council members Carl and Tom disputed. Charlie and nearly a dozen other
residents said no one other than Leffel had been inside their homes to
inspect them. The attorney declined to provide copies of any
inspections.

HUD was also made aware of problems after a 2022 report submitted by the
tribe showed occupancy numbers that exceeded the agency\'s overcrowding
standards.

In addition to the problems with the LeMay homes, several other
residents said they\'re facing similar issues with some of the temporary
tiny homes that were shipped in by barge in the fall because of the
urgent need to move. Rosemary John\'s was among the last families to
relocate. John, who grew up in Newtok and raised her six kids there,
said the move has been agonizing. Seven people are now living in her
house. This winter, John posted a video to social media that showed
water running down a wall and pooling on the floor.

Next door, in Dionne Kilongak\'s temporary house, the window sills are
already covered in mold. She works at her kitchen table every day while
her children, ages 2 and 4, scurry up and down the narrow hallway. She
said winds bring water into her house.

\"I think these aren\'t for Alaska,\" she said.

With no solution in sight, Charlie has tried to make his house feel more
homey. Tired of white paint that did nothing to hide the water damage,
he found scrap paneling from one of the housing authority\'s projects
and fastened it to his walls.

Like most people in these houses, he said he hopes they\'ll be fixed,
but he\'s unsure where to turn.

\"I have no idea who\'s going to be responsible for these homes,\" he
said.

3.3 Discussion: improving domestic diplomacy

Public institutions do not interact as sovereign bodies in a
frictionless medium. There are forces at play that operate at more
mundane levels than policy itself. Governments are not things that can
be separated from the complex world of human relationships; they are
made up of people, computers, intermittent phone connections, hearing
aids, and a whole host of human and more-than-human components (Abrams
1988). [The actual practice of [how governments--- federal,
Tribal,]{.mark} state, and regional---[communicate with each other is
"messy]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Law 2004). [And messiness is not
apolitical; [it entrenches existing power structures]{.mark}. [The
neglect of micropolitic]{.mark}s]{.underline}, which is one form of this
messiness, [[leads to]{.mark} chronically [poor relationships and
ineffective communication between Alaska Native communities and their
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Unaddressed, micropolitics]{.mark} may [prevent Indigenous communities
from engaging on equal footing with the systems designed to serve them.
This **disparages their sovereignty**]{.mark}. These
relationships]{.underline}, in order to succeed, [must be built on a
foundation of mutual trust and understanding]{.underline}. [Potawatomi
scholar]{.underline} Kyle [Whyte notes that "lessons from generations of
colonialism about how to avert bad relationship-making have not been
learned by the parties who should have learned them]{.underline}" (2020;
p. 5). [These institutional failures are not the responsibility of
Tribes]{.underline} to address (e.g., through "capacity building" as a
self-contained remedy); [framing them as such inappropriately accepts a
logic that makes colonized communities responsible for overcoming their
own marginalization]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021).

It would be wrong to identify these issues as simple matters of policy
implementation. Rather, [[these phenomena are rooted in deep structures
of colonialism and racism]{.underline}]{.mark}. The context of "natural"
disasters often gives false cover to the violent origins of
environmental vulnerability (Marino 2012; Marino et al. 2022). [[In the
case of Alaska Native villages, their current precarity is not an issue
of bad geographical luck; rather, it's political all the way
down]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The micropolitical issues identified in this paper are not universal
across the US federal government. Many agencies, including the White
House, have taken steps toward addressing these issues. For example, in
2022 the White House released "Guidance on Indigenous Knowledge,"
encouraging federal agencies to integrate traditional and Indigenous
knowledge practices, where appropriate, into their processes and
protocols. These are encouraging signs of progress (Council on
Environmental Quality 2022).

This final section elaborates upon three specific ways in which
micropolitics impinges on Alaska Native self-determination in
environmental adaptation, and outlines steps toward improving addressing
these issues.

3.3.1 Technical planning requirements limit communities' agency

[[Across the US' bureaucratic funding landscape]{.mark}, technical
planning is a prerequisite to receiving funding]{.underline} for
environmental adaptation. [Having a]{.underline} hazard mitigation plan,
or a [technical architecture for a community adaptation project, is
often a necessary condition for major infrastructure projects. As a
result, [Alaska Native communities are required to perform complex
infrastructural planning tasks that consume time and resources and limit
community agency]{.mark} by requiring third-party
involvement]{.underline}.

A "capacity gap" (Minnes and Vodden 2017) emerges in the space between
Alaska Native villages' technical capacity and funders' eligibility
requirements. [This leaves rural communities in a catch-22. In order [to
be eligible for funding, they must submit detailed and technical
plans]{.mark}. [But they require funding]{.mark} in order [to create
such plans; that level of capacity is rarely available within any small
rural community]{.mark},]{.underline} settler or Indigenous. On the wall
of one Tribal government's office building is a handwritten list of
these plans, which the community has made in recent years. It numbers in
the dozens, including a flood assessment, resilience plan, strategic
plan, strategic management plan, risk assessment, and more. Expressed as
a ratio, the village has roughly eight residents for each plan required
by various agencies.

To fill this capacity gap, third parties are often hired by Alaska
Native Tribes and their regional nonprofit organizations to translate
village needs into the language of engineering and infrastructure
planning. In one village, a phone call with EPA following Typhoon Merbok
was joined by an Anchorage-based engineer. When technical questions
arose about this particular community's recovery efforts, the engineer
was called upon to answer them. [The community was required to trust
that the engineer, who was not part of the village or even physically
present at the meeting, appropriately represented their
needs]{.underline}. [When conversations about the delivery of adaptation
services are primarily conducted in this technical language, community
members are disenfranchised, limited in their ability to self-advocate
and critique decisions that are made on their behalf or with their
partial consent]{.underline} (Rivkin et al. 2013). Third-party (and
usually profit) firms become the de facto representatives of
communities, but their ability to communicate priorities may be limited
by a lack of attention to cross-cultural issues and an inability to
frame Tribal priorities in technical language.

3.3.1.1 [**Policy [recommendations]{.mark}** [Initiate federal-Tribal
collaborations prior to the technical planning
stage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is already required in many cases by
federal law]{.underline} (Consultation and Coordination With Indian
Tribal Governments 2020). Where possible, encourage the use of
plain-English documents for community consultation. Reduce requirements
for pre-award technical planning.

3.3.2 Poor relationship-building limits trust

"[Consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity are qualities of
relationships that are critical for justice-oriented coordination across
societal institutions on any urgent matter]{.underline}," writes Whyte
(2020; p. 2). [A long history of [colonial harm has created a baseline
level of distrust between Alaska Native communities and non-Native
government officials]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bradshaw 2019). [Many Alaska
Natives working in Tribal government share the familiar experience of
speaking to government staff thousands of miles away and learning that
the person on the other line has a limited conception of these
communities' geography, history, and values.]{.underline} As one village
president told me: ["They're clueless.]{.underline}" On a phone call
with one FEMA representative, a city mayor patiently explained several
times to the confused official that his village did not have street
names.

The community leaders of an Iñupiaq village in Northwest Alaska (outside
of this study area) note that private-sector representatives (e.g., from
oil companies) tend to approach their community with more grace and
respect than representatives from state and federal government
(Kaktovik, Alaska, no date). This may be related to funding, but is
likely linked to private-sector representatives feeling a need to build
trust and goodwill. Government staff, by contrast, may feel already
empowered, and therefore unincentivized to build goodwill or disrupt
their position as gatekeepers to funding and resources.

Following cultural norms, [Alaska Native communities place an emphasis
on building relationships over time and in person. Many communities
express frustration at the perceived lack of in-person visits by agency
staff]{.underline} (Jensen et al. 2022; Pennington 2023). When visits do
occur, they are often seen as too short. In interviews, exceptions to
this general trend were spoken of warmly.

[A resident of Shishmaref told an anthropologist, "let the federal
agencies come here and experience a whole storm, not come for the day
and leave... it always seems like they don't believe us]{.underline}"
(Marino 2012; p. 379). In the regional capital of Nome, law enforcement
officers boast about successfully avoiding spending a night in Alaska
Native villages by always taking the morning flight out and catching the
evening flight back home. When one village received a multi-day visit
from FEMA officials, eight months after Typhoon Merbok, the federal
employees commuted each day from Nome on the local airline---a \$585
round-trip ticket---rather than arranging local accommodation, such as
by staying in the designated guest bedrooms at the Tribal office, or in
the apartment maintained by the school.

3.3.2.1 **Policy recommendations** [[Federal agency staff]{.mark} often
[neglect]{.mark} the simple but essential [practices required to build
trust over time. Visiting in person,]{.mark} prioritizing effective
communication, while taking the time to learn about Tribal communities
are essential steps to overcoming a history of hostile federal policies
and laying a foundation for effective collaboration]{.underline}.
[Building trust [is a critical step]{.mark}]{.underline} in effective
collaboration. As such, [[it requires time and resources]{.underline}
[that are rarely allocated]{.underline}]{.mark} [today, [to the
detriment of Tribal-federal relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Pennington (2023) urges the importance of hiring more dedicated Tribal
liaisons at FEMA---the same is true for many other agencies that
routinely coordinate with Alaska Native communities.

3.3.3 A lack of collaborative norms hinders progress

T[he funding landscape for climate adaptation projects in Alaska Native
communities is competitive by design]{.underline} (US GAO, 2022).
[Agencies]{.underline} often (but not always[) assume the role of
impartial referee. Their role is generally to judge the quality of
funding applications rather than volunteer their help and expertise in
partnership with vulnerable communities]{.underline}. In this
configuration, [Alaska Native communities and federal agencies suffer
from a noncollaborative process]{.underline} (Bradshaw 2019). [A
putatively meritocratic system often rewards the communities who best
meet agencies' stated requirements and scoring rubrics, rather than the
communities most in need of assistance]{.underline}. As a result,
communities with greater access to certain resources generally produce
more competitive applications.

Furthermore, [many Alaska Native communities feel that competing with
one another for scarce resources violates cultural norms]{.underline}
(Jensen et al. 2022; Rock 2016). One Tribal presi- dent explained after
Typhoon Merbok, "We're related to everybody in \[village A\], \[village
B\], and \[village C\]. All of our Tribes felt a tremendous sense of...
*wow, we got really lucky*, while 24 of our family and extended families
lost their homes altogether." This sentiment is common across the Norton
Sound region, where [Tribal leaders fear that by applying for federal
aid, they might be taking away from the neediest villages]{.underline}.

3.3.3.1 **[Policy recommendations]{.underline}** [[Continue to develop
joint federal-Tribal agendas]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., the EPA-Tribal
Environmental Plan) [that outline roles and responsibilities toward
delivering on shared goals. [Involve agency staff in the grant process
as **collaborators rather than referees**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Prioritize *needs-based* assessment]{.underline}]{.mark} where
feasible, [[to reduce]{.mark} the perception and reality of
[inter-Tribal competition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

3.4 Conclusion: environmental adaptation, trust, and sovereign futures

[[For Alaska Native villages]{.underline}]{.mark} --- like many rural
Indigenous communities [--- [environmental
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline} is a multifaceted and
more-than-infrastructural challenge. In many ways, it [[is inseparable
from the **broader effort to survive amid continued colonial
pressures**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Curley and Lister 2020; Whyte 2017).
In this context, [climate adaptation is not merely about coastal defense
or erosion management; it is about creating livable futures that make
space for Indigenous flourishing, self-determination, and
prosperity]{.underline}, as defined by communities (Heise et al., 2017).
These futures, in keeping with the Lakota axiom, Mitákuye Oyás'iŋ "All
my relations," (Black Elk 2016), extend far beyond the boundaries of
most agency handbooks.

Generally speaking, [micropolitical issues between Alaska Native
communities and federal agencies arise because limited consideration is
given to the historical and political contexts that led to the present
conditions of environmental, social, and political
precarity]{.underline} (Kashwan and Ribot 2021). [These problems may be
ameliorated with]{.underline} the introduction of new systems, such as
[[government-funded technical planning centers]{.mark}, that [can help
bridge the capacity gap]{.mark}. But [a commitment to Indigenous
self-determination requires ensuring that programs themselves are
designed to meet Alaska Native communities where they are,]{.mark}
[which]{.mark} in turn [requires a shift from]{.mark} [administering
aid]{.mark} programs [to]{.mark} rendering assistance and [solving
problems based on collaborative norms]{.mark}]{.underline}. [When Alaska
Native Tribal governments are perceived to fall short]{.underline} of
what is asked or expected, [settler governments need to ask themselves:
*what did we get wrong?* rather than looking to Alaska Native
communities to explain shortcomings]{.underline}.

Sociologists have long warned against the temptation to represent the
state as something separate from a collection of people and technology
(Abrams 1988). Governments do not communicate with each other; people
do. [In the case of Tribal and federal governments in
Alaska]{.underline}, government representatives speak, email, text, fax,
post on social media, and submit complicated online forms. [The
nation-to-nation relationship is ultimately
person-to-person]{.underline}. [The nation-to-nation relationship
between the United States and foreign countries is conducted through the
intimate human rituals of state dinners, gift exchanges,
ambassadorships, and telephone calls. By contrast, the "domestic
diplomacy" between Alaska Native Tribal governments and federal agencies
could hardly be more different]{.underline}. [The face-to-face
connections that engender trust and mutual understanding are widely
heralded as exceptions, rather than the rule]{.underline}. In
interviews, [Tribal leaders are quick to note the difficulty of
explaining the dynamics of Alaska Native rural communities, such as the
importance of subsistence, to outsiders.]{.underline}

**[[It is not beyond the capacity of the federal government to create
long-lasting relationships based on trust]{.mark} and shared
objectives]{.underline}**; [[it is routinely done with other sovereign
governments]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [building these relationships
requires prioritizing a form of domestic diplomacy that continues to be
neglected even at a time of renewed commitment to American Indian and
Alaska Native communities. [In rural Alaska, this requires building
interpersonal connections]{.mark},]{.underline} operating with
reasonable expectations of Tribal bureaucratic capacity[, [rendering
assistance in a collaborative manner]{.mark}, and meeting Alaska Native
communities in an earnestly diplomatic fashion, by traveling some
distance]{.underline}---politically, culturally, and geographically---
[to find a shared space where two very different governments can
collaborate successfully]{.underline}. Researchers, advocates,
policymakers, and career government officials must attend to these
micropolitical forces in order to close the persistent gaps between
ambition and outcome.

#### Failure to incorporate Native sovereignty into adaptation planning means relocation will become genocidal

the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, and a member
of the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians "Avoiding Genocide: Factors
Applicable to Adaptation Planning for Arctic Indigenous Peoples"
[Policy, Governance, and Climate Change in the Circumpolar
North]{.underline}, JSTOR //DH

Climate change and its impacts on indigenous peoples are environmental
justice issues, because "\[t\]he disproportion between tribal
contributions to global warming and the negative impacts on tribes
qualifies this as an environmental justice issue."92 Although the law
applicable in Alaska differs from the law applicable to the lower 48
states, the existing law applicable in Alaska may still be used to
further any environmental justice claim or perhaps more specifically,
climate justice claims of Alaska Natives.93 Ultimately, assuming that
the factors discussed are taken into consideration when examining
adaptation measures for indigenous communities, it may be possible that
"\[a\]daptation law can play a significant role in furthering climate
justice."94

[[Another factor]{.mark} to be considered [when choosing adaptive
strategies for Arctic indigenous communities,
especially]{.mark}]{.underline} those is [[Alaska, is indigenous
sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline} Notably, "\[t\]ribal
self-determination mandates that adaptation strategies in Indian country
be decided by the governing tribes."95 As noted above, the vast majority
of Indian country in Alaska was eradicated as a result of ANSCA. Yet,
tribal self-determination and sovereignty demand that indigenous
communities be the decision makers in adaptation planning, as explained
above under international human rights law. Moreover, adaptive measures,
more so than mitigation measures, can be developed on a local level,
which calls for increased participation for local governments---here,
indigenous governments.

[Native nations differ from other communities that may be impacted by
climate change because of their status as sovereigns]{.underline}.
Tribes' legal rights flow as an initial matter from their sovereignty
and their related historical management of the land and resources.
Native nations exist as entities separate from state and federal
governments. Myriad historical legal developments led to this
separateness.96 Although the nature of tribal sovereignty has changed
over the ensuing decades since the founding of the United States, tribal
sovereignty remains in place today.97

Accordingly[, claims raised by Native nations "must be consistent with
the promotion of tribal self-governance."]{.underline}98 An [[injustice
occurs if]{.underline}]{.mark} courts or [[policymakers fail to consider
the sovereignty of Native nation]{.underline}s]{.mark}, because Native
nations cannot meaningfully participate in the legal process if courts
fail to consider something so essential to Native nations as their
sovereignty.99 Consistent with the necessity to recognize indigenous
sovereignty to prevent injustice as well as international human rights
norms, [[any adaptation policy applicable to indigenous peoples must
provide for **broad participation** by the indigenous
community]{.mark}.]{.underline} Generally, scholars have noted that
community participation is necessary for successful climate change
adaptation.100 Such participation from indigenous communities is
particularly important for the reasons already discussed. Also,
consistent with the variety in indigenous governments and cultures,
climate change impacts are variable,101 and therefore any adaptation
plans should address the individual needs of the indigenous community
being impacted. Allowing for indigenous participation also helps ensure
that these crucial differences are taken into consideration during
adaptation planning. Notably, however, consideration of tribal
sovereignty alone cannot ensure justice for Arctic indigenous
communities considering climate change adaptation. Professor Tsosie
explains that "the problem of climate change cannot be resolved through
recognition of Native sovereignty, because the environmental harms are
largely occurring beyond the boundaries of their lands."102 Accordingly,
all factors discussed here should play a role in adaptation planning.

Finally, [adaptation planning for Arctic indigenous communities should
also take into consideration the unique cultural and spiritual
connection that many indigenous communities have with their land and
environmen]{.underline}t. Professor Tsosie explains that the importance
of land is particularly vital to most indigenous communities.

> There is no other place that indigenous people can go and still
> continue to practice their unique lifeways and cultural practices.
> [[Geographical location is essential to indigenous identity. History
> has demonstrated time and again that the forcible removal of
> indigenous communities]{.mark} from their traditional lands,
> resources, and lifeways [results in immeasurable
> harm]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Beyond legal considerations discussed above, many indigenous peoples
also have a strong spiritual and cultural connection to the land upon
which they reside or to their traditional homelands. For many indigenous
peoples, their spirituality is intimately connected to the Earth and
their environment.104 As a result, [[as the effects of climate change
ravage their environment, indigenous peoples may experience both a
physical and a spiritual loss]{.mark} connected with the negative impact
on the environment]{.underline}. Similarly, [because of the close
spiritual connection that many indigenous peoples have with the
environment, their culture and traditions are also intimately connected
to the larger environment]{.underline}.105 It is commonplace in many
indigenous communities for annual traditions and customs to be tied to
certain environmental occurrences. [As climate change threatens to
dramatically change the environment, culture and tradition may also
therefore be threatened.]{.underline}

In part because of this strong connection to place, Professor Tsosie
concludes that ["\[t\]he international dialogue on climate change is
currently focused on a strategy of [adaptation to climate change]{.mark}
that [includes the projected removal of entire communities]{.mark}, if
necessary]{.underline}. [**[Such a strategy will prove
genocidal]{.underline}** [for many groups]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}."106 Because of the strong connection
many indigenous communities have with a particular space, Professor
Sarah Krakoff explains that "\[t\]he option of relocating is certainly
as available to tribal communities as to others, but relocation has a
different meaning if the cultural definition of a people is bound to a
location and its unique ecological offerings."107 [[Given the harsh
realities of climate change, especially those faced by Arctic indigenous
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, as discussed above [[many Alaskan
Native communities]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as the Native Villages of
Kivalina and Newtok), [[are actively considering
relocation]{.underline}.]{.mark} Hopefully, [if the factors discussed
above are included in]{.underline} any discussion of adaptive strategies
that include relocation, [such relocation **will not prove
"genocidal**."]{.underline} For example, [when considering relocation,
it may be possible to keep indigenous communities within their
traditional homelands]{.underline}.108

Conclusion

Climate change is drastically affecting the Arctic environment. Because
of these drastic changes, Arctic indigenous peoples' lifestyles are
being dramatically altered, and as a result, Arctic indigenous cultures
and traditions are threatened as well. [Given that it is unlikely that
mitigation efforts will be able to redress the situation currently
facing these communities]{.underline} and that previous legal
claims---such as the ICC petition and Kivalina complaint---have proven
largely unsuccessful, [[many Arctic indigenous communities may
increasingly consider adaptive strategi]{.underline}es.]{.mark} Although
such strategies certainly have the potential to be very helpful to
indigenous communities trying to survive climate change, adaptation is
not without its risks for indigenous peoples, as highlighted by
Professor Tsosie. Accordingly, adaptive planners working with Arctic
indigenous communities are encouraged to incorporate a number of factors
into any adaptation planning. [[Adaptation planning for these
communities should include]{.underline}]{.mark} considerations of
international human rights law, [[environmental justice, tribal
sovereignty, and the]{.mark} unique [connection that many]{.mark}
indigenous communities [have with their homeland]{.mark} and
environment]{.underline}. Hopefully, [[by incorporating these factors
into adaptation planning, climate change adaptation **will not prove
"genocidal" for Arctic indigenous peoples.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[**[Unclear federal leadership]{.mark}** [is the key challenge to
climate migration as a resilience strategy]{.mark},]{.underline}
according to our analysis of literature we reviewed and interviews with
agency officials, selected experts, and stakeholders during our site
visits. Specifically, [[unclear federal leadership inhibits the ability
of federal agencies to provide effective assistance]{.mark} to states
and communities for climate migration. [Because no agency has been given
the authority to lead]{.mark} and organize federal
assistance]{.underline} for climate migration, [[the federal
government's support]{.underline}]{.mark} for climate migration efforts
[[has been]{.underline} [limited and]{.underline} **[provided on an ad
hoc basis]{.underline}**]{.mark} under the broad legislative authority
of programs designed for other purposes. Officials from the Denali
Commission, FEMA, HUD, and NOAA said it is not clear who should lead
such efforts, and this lack of clarity has led to problems in the few
climate migration efforts currently under way.

For example, [[although the **Denali Commission** has played a
significant role in helping Newtok relocate]{.mark}, [the commission
does not have explicit statutory authority to lead]{.mark} and
coordinate [federal assistance to other at-risk Alaska Native
villages]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark},]{.underline} according to
commission officials, [[has]{.mark}]{.underline} recently
[[refocused]{.underline}]{.mark} its efforts [[on other
priorities]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to stakeholders in Alaska and
Denali Commission officials**[, [this]{.mark} has [limited the ability
of Alaska Native villages to navigate federal program
requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [pool federal funding sources, and
secure technical assistance for relocation planning]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and implementation]{.underline}. [[As a result, it has taken over **30
years** to begin relocating Newtok]{.mark}, and,]{.underline} according
to commission officials, [it is unclear who will lead efforts to assist
other at-risk Alaska Native villages]{.underline}. Unclear federal
leadership and coordination has also contributed to a complex
resettlement process for Isle de Jean Charles that has lasted more than
20 years and that may not meet the needs of the island's residents,
according to stakeholders in Louisiana.109

In December 2016, to help the federal government develop the
institutional capability to assist communities with relocation, HUD, the
Denali Commission, FEMA, NOAA, the Corps and six other agencies
established an Interagency Working Group on Community-Led Managed
Retreat and Voluntary Relocation. One objective of the working group was
to identify the federal role in community-led managed retreat and
migration efforts, including developing a process to define individual
agency roles and to select a lead federal agency.110 However, the
interagency working group was abandoned in 2017, and according to HUD
and FEMA officials, did not issue any guidance or lessons learned to
help develop the federal institutional capability to assist communities
with retreat or relocation. As a result, according to FEMA and
commission officials, there is little clarity on how the federal
government could effectively assist communities with climate migration.

As we reported in our 2019 High-Risk Update, the increased reliance on
federal disaster assistance programs caused by the rising number of
climate-related disasters is a key reason that climate change is
creating a significant fiscal risk to the federal government.111 In
addition, we reported in November 2015 that decisions state, local, and
private sector entities make can affect the federal government's fiscal
exposure to climate change since those entities are responsible for
planning, constructing, and maintaining certain types of vulnerable
infrastructure that are paid for partly with federal funds, insured by
federal programs, or eligible for federal disaster assistance.112

Furthermore, we reported in our 2019 High-Risk Update that, to reduce
its fiscal exposure, [the federal government needs a cohesive strategic
approach with strong leadership and the authority to manage climate
change risks across the entire range of related federal
activities]{.underline}, including federal support for climate
resilience activities such as climate migration.113 Encouraging clearer
federal leadership to help states and communities plan and implement
climate migration projects is also consistent with our prior work on
risk management best practices and improving disaster resilience.114 For
example, according to Enterprise Risk Management best practices, there
must be a "risk owner" to manage the treatment of risks and
opportunities to achieve goals within and across programs.115

Finally, according to some stakeholders we interviewed during our site
visits, [clear federal leadership for climate migration efforts would
improve state and local decision-making on climate
migration]{.underline}. For example, Louisiana officials said that
improved federal leadership for climate migration or relocation, with
better coordination and defined agency roles, would help communities
access the best available federal expertise to identify climate risks
and prioritize actions to improve their resilience. Similarly,
[[stakeholders in Alaska stated that with explicit authority to lead and
coordinate Newtok's relocation effort, the Denali Commission could have
improved coordination]{.mark} across agencies [to]{.mark} identify and
[access sources of federal technical and financial assistance for the
communities at the most risk]{.mark}]{.underline}.116

Our collective failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stop
fracking and oil and gas drilling violates the human rights of those who
have least contributed to our climate crisis. [As the ice disappears,
erosion accelerates and threatens the ability of Alaska Native
communities to remain]{.underline} in the places they call home.
[[Indigenous communities in the Arctic are now some of the first
communities to face the permanent loss of the ancestral lands]{.mark} on
which they have survived]{.underline} and thrived [for
millennia]{.underline}.

[[For several Alaska Native communities, relocation of their entire
community is the only long-term adaptation strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}
to protect the lives of community residents from climate change impacts.
Climate-induced community relocations are perhaps the greatest human
rights challenge of our time. Population relocation affects the rights
to life and self-determination, as well as a wide range of social,
economic, and cultural rights.

Shishmaref, Kivalina, and Newtok are three of the most imperiled Alaskan
communities. Each community decided decades ago that relocation was the
only long-term solution to protect community residents and ensure their
cultural survival. Federal and state government agencies agree, yet
relocation has not yet occurred. [[Our inability to adapt]{.mark} to
this radically changing climate [is demonstrated in the

history, and denial of genocide. He was also involved in the

longtime founding co-editor (Roger Smith, Genocide and the Modern Age:

[Genocide is almost always a premeditated act calculated to achieve the
ends of its perpetrators through mass murder. Sometimes,]{.underline}
however, [[genocidal consequences]{.mark} precede any conscious decision
**to [destroy]{.mark} [innocent groups]{.mark}** to satisfy one\'s
aims.]{.underline} [This is most often the case [in]{.mark} the early
phases of [colonial]{.mark} [domination]{.mark}, where through violence,
disease, and relentless pressure [indigenous peoples are pushed]{.mark}
[toward extinction]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the recognition of the
consequences of one\'s acts, however, the issue is changed: to persist
is to intend the death of a people. This pattern of pressure,
recognition, and persistence is typically what happened in the
nineteenth century. Today, however, [when indigenous groups come under
pressure, the intention to destroy them is present from the outset;
there are few illusions about the likely outcome.]{.underline} The
distinction, then, between premeditated and unpremeditated genocide is
not decisive, for sooner or later the genocidal is transformed into
genocide. Rather than being simply an expression of passion, genocide is
a rational instrument to achieve an end. While these ends have varied
from perpetrator to perpetrator and, to a large extent, by historical
period, they have typically included the following: revenge, conquest,
gain, power, and purification/salvation. From these we can construct a
grammar of motives which, in effect, asks the perpetrator: What are you
trying to do and why is it so important that you are willing to
sacrifice thousands, even millions of lives (including those of
children) to achieve it? Formal, but nevertheless useful, answers to
these questions are contained in the different types of genocide,
arranged in terms of the grammar of motives. Classified in this manner,
the pure types of genocide are retributive, institutional, utilitarian,
monopolistic, and ideological. Retributive Genocide. Retribution may
play a role in all genocide, but it does so mainly as a rationalization:
it is a way of blaming the victim. Though it draws from the vocabulary
of justice and of judicially administered punishment, genocide destroys
persons most often for what they are rather than for anything they have
done. In this sense, retribution flows from the dehumanization that has
been fastened to the victims before they are attacked. As a principal
motive in genocide, retribution is rare, but it does seem to figure
prominently in accounts of conquerors like Chingis-khan (Genghis Khan).9
Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how the \"Conqueror of the World,\"
as he called himself, differed in his actions when inspired by revenge
than he and others did when they engaged in the institutional genocide
associated with warfare until about the fifteenth century. Institutional
Genocide. Institutional genocide was the major source of politically
sanctioned mass murder in the ancient and medieval worlds. The massacre
of men, the enslavement of women and children, and, often, the razing of
towns and the destruction of the surrounding countryside, were universal
aspects of conquest: genocide was embedded in the very notion of
warfare.10 As such, no explicit decision had to be made to commit
genocide -it had become routinized. In part, institutional genocide was
motivated by the desire to create terror, to display one\'s power, and
to remove the possibility of future retaliation. But it was also due to
a failure of political imagination: genocide was a substitute for
politics. Instead of ruling a city or territory, extracting tribute from
it, and perhaps even incorporating it into one\'s own system of power
and authority, the society was devastated. By the late medieval period
this practice had largely ended in the West (indeed, it had begun to
change with the Romans, who understood that only through politics could
one build an empire), yet it became a prominent part of the Crusades and
was made all the more deadly because of religious passion.11 In any
case, institutional genocide continued in the East with figures like
Timur Lenk until the fifteenth century. For some 500 years thereafter,
the genocide of conquest disappeared. It is possible, however, that both
guerrilla warfare and the use of nuclear weapons signify a revival of
this early form of genocide. If the means are different, the motives
seem not that dissimilar, and the consequences include both widespread
devastation and the massive taking of innocent life by those in
authority. **[[Utilitarian Genocide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If utility
played a role in institutional genocide, it [[became]{.mark}
particularly [prominent]{.mark}]{.underline} in the genocide of the
sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, [[when colonial domination]{.mark}
and exploitation of indigenous peoples [in the Americas]{.mark},
Australia, Tasmania, parts of Africa, and elsewhere [became
pronounced]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has continued in the twentieth
century, especially in Latin America, where ~~Indians~~ [\[[indigenous
people\] have been subjected to]{.mark} [genocidal attacks **in the name
of** ]{.mark}progress and **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Apart
from the more sadistic aspects of this kind of destruction, the object
has been Indian land-for the timber it contains, the minerals that can
be extracted, and the cattle it can feed-and, at the turn of the
century, Indian labor to harvest, under conditions of forced labor, the
sap of the rubber tree.12 Richard Rubenstein has recently argued that
development leads to a population \"surplus,\" which in turn leads to
programs to eliminate the superfluous population.13 What is happening
with the remaining indigenous population of Latin America, and what was
the fate of millions in various areas of the world earlier, has nothing,
however, to do with a surplus population (whatever that is, for
Rubenstein never defines his basic term). [They are being killed, were
killed, because of a combination of ethnocentrism and simple greed. The
[basic]{.mark} [proposition]{.mark} contained [in utilitarian genocide
is that some persons must die so that others can live well]{.mark}. If
that proposition no longer claims a large number of lives, it is because
the previous genocide was so effective and the remaining tribes so
small, with at most a few thousand members each. Yet precisely because
of the tenacity of the assaults against them, and the small size of the
groups, [utilitarian genocide]{.mark},]{.underline} although somewhat
rare in the twentieth century, [[tends to be
**total**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 'Extinction' is an [empty superlative]{.underline}. Forgo improbable impacts -- they re-entrench humanity into Western frames that manifest colonial genocide

\"Decolonizing against extinction part II: Extinction is not a
metaphor - it is literally genocide,\" September 27, 2017,
https://worldlyir.wordpress.com/category/extinction/)//SM

Extinction is not a metaphor... [Extinction has become an emblem of
Western, and white-dominated, fears about 'the end of **the(ir)**
world'.]{.underline} This scientific term is saturated with emotional
potency, stretched and contorted to embody almost any nightmare, from
climate change to asteroid strikes. In academic and public contexts
alike, it is regularly interchanged with other terms and concepts -- for
instance, 'species death', global warming or ecological collapse.
Diffused into sublime scales -- mass extinctions measured in millions of
(Gregorian calendar) years, a planet totalized by the threat of nuclear
destruction -- '[[extinction' has become an **empty**]{.mark}
**[superlative]{.mark}**, one that that gestures to an abstract form of
unthinkability. [It teases Western subjects with]{.mark} images of
[generalized demise]{.mark} that might, if it gets bad enough, even
threaten us, or the figure of 'humanity' that we enshrine as a
universal.]{.underline} This figure of 'humanity', derived from Western
European enlightenment ideals, emphasizes individual, autonomous actors
who are fully integrated into the global market system; who are
responsible citizens of nation-states; who conform to Western ideas of
health and well-being; who partake of 'culture'; who participate in
democratic state-based politics; who refrain from physical violence; and
who manage their 'resources' responsibly (Mitchell 2014). Oddly,
[[exposure to the fear]{.mark} of extinction [contributes to the]{.mark}
formation and [bolstering of]{.mark} contemporary [Western
subjects]{.mark}. Contemplating the sublime destruction of 'humanity'
offers the thrill of abjection: the perverse pleasure derived from
exposure to something by which one is revolted.]{.underline} Claire
Colebrook detects this thrill-seeking impulse in the profusion of
Western blockbuster films and TV shows that imagine and envision the
destruction of earth, or at least of 'humanity'. It also throbs through
a flurry of recent best-selling books -- both fiction and speculative
non-fiction (see Oreskes and Conway 2014; Newitz 2013; Weisman 2008). In
a forthcoming intervention, Noah Theriault and I (2018) argue that these
imaginaries are a form of porn that normalizes the profound violences
driving extinction, while cocooning its viewers in the secure space of
the voyeur. Certainly, there are many Western scientists,
conservationists and policy-makers who are genuinely committed to
stopping the extinction of others, perhaps out of fear for their own
futures. Yet [[extinction]{.mark} is not quite real [for
Western]{.mark}, and especially white, [subjects]{.mark}; it [is a
**fantasy of negation**]{.mark} that evokes thrill, melancholy, anger
and existential purpose. It is a metaphor [that expresses the
destructive desires of]{.mark} these [beings]{.mark}, and the negativity
against which we define our subjectivity. But **[extinction is not a
metaphor]{.mark}**: it is a very real expression of violence that
systematically destroys particular beings, worlds, life forms and the
relations that enable them to flourish. These are real, unique beings,
worlds and relations -- as well as somebody's family, Ancestors,
siblings, future generations -- who are violently
destroyed.]{.underline} Extinction can only be used unironically as a
metaphor by people who have never been threatened with it, told it is
their inevitable fate, or lost their relatives and Ancestors to it --
and who assume that they probably never will. This argument is directly
inspired by the call to arms issued in 2012 by Eve Tuck and Wayne K.
Yang and more recently by Cutcha Risling-Baldy. The first, seminal piece
demonstrates how settler cultures use the violence of metaphorical
abstraction to excuse themselves from the real work of decolonization:
ensuring that land and power is in Indigenous hands. Risling-Baldy's
brilliant follow-up extends this logic to explain how First People like
Coyote have been reduced to metaphors through settler appropriation. In
both cases, engagement with Indigenous peoples and their relations masks
moves to innocence: acts that make it appear as if settlers are engaging
in decolonization, while in fact we are consolidating the power
structures that privilege us. In this series, want to show how [Western,
and [white-dominated]{.mark}, [discourses on 'extinction']{.mark} appear
to address the systematic destruction of peoples and other beings while
enacting moves to innocence that mask their culpability [and
**perpetuate structures of**]{.mark} **[violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
As I argued in Part I of this series, extinction is an expression of
colonial violence. As such, it needs to be addressed through direct
decolonization, including the dismantling of settler colonial structures
of violence, and the resurgence of Indigenous worlds. Following Tuck,
Yang and Risling-Baldy's lead, I want to show how and why the violences
that drive extinction have come to be invisible within mainstream
discourses. Salient amongst these is the practice of genocide against
Indigenous peoples other than humans. ...it is literally genocide. [What
Western science calls 'extinction' is not an unfortunate, unintended
consequence of desirable 'human' activities. It is an embodiment of
particular patterns of structural violence [that disproportionately
affect]{.mark} specific [racialized groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} In some
cases, 'extinction' is directly, deliberately and systematically
inflicted in order to create space for aggressors, including settler
states. For this reason, [[it has]{.mark} rightly [been framed as
a]{.mark}n aspect or [tool of colonial genocides]{.mark} against
Indigenous human peoples.]{.underline} Indeed, many theorists have shown
that the 'extirpation' of life forms (their total removal from a
particular place) is an instrument for enacting genocide upon Indigenous
humans (see Mazis 2008; Laduke 1999; Stannard 1994). Specifically, the
removal of key sources of food, clothing and other basic materials makes
survival on the land impossible for the people targeted. Nehiyaw thinker
Tasha Hubbard (2014) makes a qualitatively distinct argument. She points
out that the Buffalo are First People, the elder brothers of the Nehiyaw
people (and other Indigenous nations -- see Benton-Banai 2010). Starting
in the mid-1800s, the tens of millions of buffalo that ranged across
Turtle Island were nearly eliminated through strategic patterns of
killing carried out by settler-state-sponsored military and commercial
forces. Their killing was linked to governmental imperatives to clear
and territorially annex the Great Plains by removing its Indigenous
peoples. As Hubbard points out, methods of destroying buffalo herds
included large-scale killing, but also the disruption of their social
structures, the destruction of the ecosystems on which they rely, and
the removal of calves. These acts involve each of the components of the
definition of genocide enshrined in the UN Genocide Convention: (a)
Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm
to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group
conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in
whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births
within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to
another group. From Hubbard's viewpoint, rooted in Nehiyaw philosophy
and ethical-legal principles, the systematic destruction of the buffalo
is not like genocide, nor is it exclusively a tool for carrying out
genocide against human peoples. It is genocide in its own right: an
attempt to destroy a particular First People and the possibilities of
its continuity. In other words, the deliberate and systematic attempt to
eliminate the buffalo, enacted by settler states, simultaneously enacted
genocide against Indigenous peoples and their nonhuman relatives.
[Genocides of Indigenous peoples (human and otherwise) continue apace in
contemporary settler states, transformed into multiple
manifestations.]{.underline} For instance, they are integral to
'biosecurity' strategies designed to police the biological boundaries of
these states and their citizens. Laced with racializing and xenophobic
rhetoric (Subramaniam 2001), strategies such as culling or planned
eradications are intended to remove 'invasive' or 'foreign' life forms
in order to protect 'Native' ones. Many of the 'invasive' life forms
targeted for destruction were transported to unfamiliar lands through
colonial patterns of settlement and global trade flows. However, this
logic of elimination (Wolfe 2006) is often perverted, turned against
Indigenous\* beings whose flourishing impedes the expansion or
consolidation of the colonial state. For instance, Deborah Bird Rose
(2011 a, 2011 b) shows how this form of violence is continually waged
against flying foxes, who are framed by the settler state as "pest\[s\]
whose extinction is \[deliberately\] sought". This [act of elimination
involves explicit genocidal ideation, or the imagination of the
destruction of a people.]{.underline} Rose characterizes it as a "matter
of imagining a world without \[dingoes or flying foxes\], then setting
out to create it" (Rose 2011a). The Australian settler state has used
multiple tactics to induce terror and preclude flourishing amongst
flying foxes, from the emission of high-pitched electronic signals to
smearing trees with python excrement (Rose 2011b). Indeed, in 2014, I
lived near to the roosting site of a group of flying foxes in Turrbal
and Jagera Country (suburban Brisbane to settlers). Such nesting places
are called 'colonies' , reflecting a Western scientific rhetoric that
frames Indigenous peoples as 'invaders' of the settler state. The trees
that housed the nesting site backed onto a municipal facility, whose
fence had been covered with barbed wire, in which many of the bats
snared their wings and starved to death. This 'security' measure --
designed to protect the facilities relied upon by urban settlers from
the intrusion of flying foxes -- is a powerful weapon for precluding
ongoing flourishing of Indigenous other-than-human peoples. I learned
from neighbours that this 'colony' had previously been 'moved' from
several other sites around the city, suffering significant declines in
population each time. Indeed, despite reported declines of 95% in flying
fox communities in Queensland and neighbouring New South Wales, the
Queensland settler state legalized the shooting of the bats in 2012 by
fruitgrowers. Of course, in some cases, the elimination of life forms is
not as targeted or intentional -- it may take the form of land-based
extractive violence, the creep of ocean acidification, the decimation of
rainforests by climate change. Proponents of a Eurocentric definition of
genocide could argue that these events lack intention. Indeed, within
international law, intention to commit genocide is a necessary criteria
for conviction. However, theorists of critical genocide studies have
long argued that this definition is inadequate: it brackets out a great
many of the acts, logics and structures that produce the destruction of
unique peoples. According to Tony Barta, definitions of genocide that
focus on 'purposeful annihilation', and in particular on physical
killing, have "devalu\[ed\] all other concepts of less planned
destruction, even if the effects are the same" (Barta 2000, 238). For
this reason, he shifts the focus from 'genocidal intention' to
'genocidal outcome' -- that is, from the abstract assignation of
genocidal agency to the felt and embodied effects of eliminative
violence. It is the focus on intent, he contends, that allows white
Australians to imagine that their relationship with Aboriginal people is
non-genocidal despite overwhelming evidence of systematic and deliberate
racialized destruction over several centuries. In contrast, an approach
based on 'genocidal outcomes' makes it possible to account for complex
causality and weak intentionality -- that is, for myriad acts mediated
by subtle, normalized structures that, together, work to eliminate a
people. I want to argue that the same logic applies to nonhuman peoples:
the destruction of a life form, its relations with other beings and its
possible futures is a genocidal outcome, whether or not intention can be
identified. Similarly, Christopher Powell (2007) argues that, since a
'genos' is a "network of practical social relations, destruction of a
genos means the forcible breaking down of those relationships...these
effects could be produced without a coherent intent to destroy. They
could result from sporadic and uncoordinated actions whose underlying
connection is the production of a new society in which there is simply
no room for the genos in question to exist. They might even result from
well-meaning attempts to do good" (Powell 2007, 538) As I have argued
elsewhere, extinction is defined by the breaking of relations and the
systematic destruction of the conditions of plurality that nurture
co-flourishing worlds. Whether inflicted out as a deliberate act of
extirpation, or as the convergent effect of eliminative logics expressed
over centuries and enormous spatial scales, extinction is the
destruction of relations and the heterogenous societies they nurture.
Understood in this way, '[[extinction' is]{.mark} not a metaphor for
genocide or other forms of large-scale violence: it is [a **distinct
manifestation of**]{.mark} **[genocide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Masking
the genocidal logics that drive extinction involves several moves to
innocence (Tuck and Yang 2012). [[Treating]{.mark} [extinction as
something short]{.mark} of genocide [entrenches Eurocentric
understandings of personhood]{.mark} that are limited to homo sapiens,
**[which is]{.mark} itself** [an act of violence against these
peoples]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ironically, the entrenchment of this
dichotomy also enables the logic of 'dehumanization', in which human
communities are likened to reviled nonhumans (for instance, cockroaches)
in order to motivate violence against them. As I have argued elsewhere
(Mitchell 2014), the logic of generalised 'dehumanisation' is uniquely
effective in Western frameworks in which the lack of ethical status for
beings other than humans removes obstacles to their mass destruction.
Within worlds in which human and nonhuman persons are linked through
complex systems of law, treaties, protocols and long-standing relations,
this claim is illogical. Within Western settler states, however, it
functions as a means of justifying ongoing violence against Indigenous
peoples and their relations. In addition, [by [framing extinction as a
problem for a universal figure of 'humanity']{.mark}]{.underline} (more
on this to follow...) [mainstream discourses of extinction [obscure
its]{.mark} profound [entwinement with]{.mark} race and
[racializing]{.mark} [structures]{.mark}.]{.underline} These examples
make it clear that [eliminative violence is targeted on specific groups
of people and their other-than-human relations, as defined by the
aggressors.]{.underline} Indeed, patterns of genocidal violence extend
racializing categories, hierarchies and eliminative impulses to
other-than-human peoples. Just as approaching gender violence separately
from race effaces their intersection, understanding extinction as
distinct from race is deeply misleading. This is not only because
racialized people are more likely to suffer from the effects of
'extinction' and other forms of environmental racism (which they are).
It is also because the eliminative violence that drives extinction
extend and enact race beyond the category of homo sapiens by defining
particular groups against white settler norms and as threats to the
settler society. To approach extinction separately from issues of race
is, therefore, to miss one of its most defining features.

#### "Vote neg to prevent extinction" is a settler fantasy used to further Native dispossession. Reject that logic because it's intimately tied to extermination.

[[Settlers love]{.mark} to contemplate [the possibility of their **own
extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [to read many contemporary literary
representations of settler colonialism is to find settlers strangely
satisfied in dreaming of ends that never come]{.underline}. This
tendency is widely prevalent in English-language representations of
settler colonialism produced since the 1980s: [the possibility of an
ending -- [the likelihood that the settler race will]{.mark} one day
[die out]{.mark} -- [is a common theme]{.mark}]{.underline} in literary
and pop culture considerations of colonialism's future. Yet it has
barely been remarked how surprising it is that this theme is so present.
[For settlers]{.underline}, of all people, [to obsessively ruminate on
their own finitude is counterintuitive]{.underline}, for few modern
social formations have been more resistant to change than settler
colonialism. With a few exceptions (French Algeria being the largest),
the settler societies established in the last 300 years in the Americas,
Australasia, and Southern Africa have all retained the basic features
that define them as settler states -- namely, the structural privileging
of settlers at the expense of indigenous peoples, and the normalization
of whiteness as the marker of political agency and rights -- and they
have done so notwithstanding the sustained resistance that has been
mounted whenever such an order has been built. [Settlers think all the
time that they might one day end, [even though]{.mark} (perhaps because)
[that]{.mark} ending [seems **unlikely** ever to
happen]{.mark}.]{.underline} The significance of this paradox for
settler-colonial literature is the subject of this article. [Considering
the problem of futurity offers a useful foil to traditional analyses of
settlercolonial narrative, which typically examine settlers' attitudes
towards history in order to highlight a constitutive anxiety about the
past -- about origins]{.underline}. Settler colonialism, the argument
goes, has a problem with historical narration that arises from a
contradiction in its founding mythology. In Stephen Turner's
formulation, the settler subject is by definition one who comes from
elsewhere but who strives to make this place home. The settlement
narrative must explain how this gap -- which is at once geographical,
historical, and existential -- has been bridged, and the settler
transformed from outsider into indigene. Yet the transformation must
remain constitutively incomplete, because the desire to be at home
necessarily invokes the spectre of the native, whose existence (which
cannot be disavowed completely because it is needed to define the
settler's difference, superiority, and hence claim to the land)
inscribes the settler's foreignness, thus reinstating the gap between
settler and colony that the narrative was meant to efface.1
[[Settler]{.mark}-[colonial narrative is]{.mark} thus [shaped around its
need to **erase**]{.mark} and evoke **[the native]{.mark}**, [to make
the indigene]{.mark} both [invisible]{.mark} and present in a
contradictory pattern that prevents settlers from ever moving on from
the moment of colonization]{.underline}.2 As evidence of this
constitutive contradiction, [critics have identified in settler-colonial
discourse symptoms of psychic distress such as disavowal, inversion, and
repression]{.underline}.3 Indeed, the frozen temporality of
settler-colonial narrative, fixated on the moment of the frontier,
recalls nothing so much as Freud's description of the 'repetition
compulsion' attending trauma.4 As Lorenzo Veracini puts it, because:
'settler society' can thus be seen as a fantasy where a perception of a
constant struggle is juxtaposed against an ideal of 'peace' that can
never be reached, settler projects embrace and reject violence at the
same time. The settler colonial situation is thus a circumstance where
the tension between contradictory impulses produces long-lasting psychic
conflicts and a number of associated psychopathologies.5 [Current
scholarship has thus focused primarily on settler-colonial narrative's
view of the past,]{.underline} asking how such a contradictory and
troubled relationship to history might affect present-day ideological
formations. [Critics have rarely considered what such narratological
tensions might produce when [the settler gaze is turned to the]{.mark}
[future.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Few social formations are more stubbornly
resistant to change than settlement, suggesting that a future beyond
settler colonialism might be simply unthinkable]{.underline}. Veracini,
indeed, suggests that settler-colonial narrative can never contemplate
an ending: that settler decolonization is inconceivable because settlers
lack the metaphorical tools to imagine their own demise.6 This article
outlines why I partly disagree with that view. I argue that [the
narratological paradox that defines settler-colonial narrative does make
the future a problematic object of contemplation. But that does not make
settler decolonization unthinkable]{.underline} per se; as I will show,
[[settlers]{.mark} do often [try to imagine their demise]{.mark}
--]{.underline} [but they do so [in a way that **reasserts the
paradoxes**]{.mark} [of their founding ideology]{.mark}]{.underline},
with the result that [the radical potentiality of decolonization is
undone even as it is invoked]{.underline}. I argue that, notwithstanding
Veracini's analysis, [there is a metaphor via which the end of settler
colonialism unspools -- [the]{.mark}]{.underline} quasi-biological
[[concept of extinction]{.mark}, which]{.underline}, when deployed as a
narrative trope, [[offers settlers a chance to consider and
**disavow**]{.mark} their demise]{.underline}, [just as they consider
and then disavow [the **violence of their
origins**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This article traces [the importance of
the trope of extinction for contemporary settler-colonial
literature]{.underline}, with a focus on South Africa, Canada, and
Australia. It explores variations in how the death of settler
colonialism is conceptualized, drawing a distinction between
historio-civilizational narratives of the rise and fall of empires, and
a species-oriented notion of extinction that draws force from public
anxiety about climate change -- an invocation that adds another level of
ambivalence by drawing on ['[rational' fears for the
future]{.mark}]{.underline} (because climate change may well render the
planet uninhabitable to humans) in order to [[narrativize a form of
**social death**]{.mark} that, strictly speaking, belongs to a different
order of knowledge altogether.]{.underline} As such, [my analysis is
intended to draw the attention of settlercolonial studies toward
futurity and the ambivalence of settler paranoia]{.underline}, while
highlighting a potential point of cross-fertilization between
settler-colonial and eco-critical approaches to contemporary literature.
[That 'extinction' should be a key word in the settler-colonial lexicon
is no surprise]{.underline}. In Patrick Wolfe's phrase,7 [[settler
colonialism is]{.mark} [predicated on a 'logic of elimination']{.mark}
that tends towards the extermination]{.underline} -- by one means or
another -- [of indigenous peoples]{.underline}.8 This logic is apparent
in archetypal settler narratives like James Fenimore Cooper's The Last
of the Mohicans (1826), a historical novel whose very title blends the
melancholia and triumph that demarcate settlers' affective responses to
the supposed inevitability of indigenous extinction. Concepts like
'stadial development' -- by which societies progress through stages,
progressively eliminating earlier social forms -- and 'fatal impact' --
which names the biological inevitability of strong peoples supplanting
weak -- all contribute to the notion that settler colonialism is a kind
of 'ecological process' 9 that necessitates the extinction of inferior
races. [What is surprising, though,]{.underline} [is how often the trope
of extinction also appears with reference to settlers themselves; it
makes sense for settlers to narrate how their presence entails others'
destruction, but it is less clear why their attempts to imagine futures
should presume extinction to be their own logical end as
well]{.underline}. The idea appears repeatedly in English-language
literary treatments of settler colonialism. Consider, for instance, the
following rumination on the future of South African settler society,
from Olive Schreiner's 1883 Story of an African Farm: It was one of
them, one of those wild old Bushmen, that painted those pictures there.
He did not know why he painted but he wanted to make something, so he
made these. \[...\] Now the Boers have shot them all, so that we never
see a yellow face peeping out among the stones. \[...\] And the wild
bucks have gone, and those days, and we are here. But we will be gone
soon, and only the stones will lie on, looking at everything like they
look now.10 In this example, the narrating settler character, Waldo,
recognizes prior indigenous inhabitation but his knowledge comes
freighted with an expected sense of biological superiority, made
apparent by his description of the 'Bushman's' 'yellow face', and lack
of mental self-awareness. What is not clear is why Waldo's contemplation
of colonial genocide should turn immediately to the assumption that a
similar fate awaits his people as well. A similar presumption of racial
vulnerability permeates other late nineteenthcentury novels from the
imperial metropole, such as Dracula and War of the Worlds, which are
plotted around the prospect of invasions that would see the extinction
of British imperialism, and, in the process, the human species. Such
[[anxieties draw]{.mark} energy [from]{.mark} a pattern of **[settler
defensiveness]{.mark}** that can be observed across numerous
settler-colonial contexts]{.underline}. Marilyn Lake's and Henry
Reynold's account of the emergence of transnational 'whiteness'
highlights the paradoxical fact that [while white male settlers have
been arguably the most privileged class in history, they have routinely
perceived themselves to be 'under siege', threatened with destruction to
the extent that their very identity of 'whiteness was born in the
apprehension of imminent loss']{.underline}.11 [[The fear of looming
annihilation]{.underline} [serves a]{.underline}]{.mark} [powerful
[ideological function]{.mark} in settler communities, [working to
**foster racial solidarity**]{.mark}, **[suppress dissent]{.mark}**,
[and **legitimate violence**]{.mark} [against indigenous populations
who]{.mark}]{.underline}, by any objective measure, [[are]{.mark} **far
more [at risk]{.mark}** [of extermination]{.mark} than the settlers who
fear them]{.underline}. Ann Curthoys and Dirk Moses have traced this
pattern in Australia and Israel-Palestine, respectively.12 This
scholarship suggests that [[narratives of settler
extinction]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} [acts of
**[ideological mystification]{.mark}**, obscuring the brutal
inequalities of the frontier behind a mask of white
vulnerability]{.underline} -- an argument with which I sympathize.
However, this article shows how there is more to settler-colonial
extinction narratives than bad faith. I argue that we need a more
nuanced understanding of how they encode a specifically settler-colonial
framework for imagining the future, one that has implications for how we
understand contemporary literatures from settler societies, and which
allows us to see extinction as a genuine, if flawed, attempt to envisage
social change. In the remainder of this paper I consider extinction's
function as a metaphor of decolonization. I use this phrase to invoke,
without completely endorsing, Tuck and Yang's argument that [to treat
decolonization figuratively, as]{.underline} I argue
[[extinction]{.mark} [narratives]{.mark} do, is necessarily to [preclude
radical change]{.mark}, [**creating opportunities** for]{.mark} settler
'moves to innocence' that re-legitimate [racial
inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 The counterview to this pessimistic
perspective is offered by Veracini, who suggests that progressive change
to settler-colonial relationships will only happen if narratives can be
found that make decolonization thinkable.14 This article enters the
debate between these two perspectives by asking what it means for
settler writers to imagine the future via the trope of extinction. Does
extinction offer a meaningful way to think about ending settler
colonialism, or does it re-activate settler-colonial patterns of thought
that allow exclusionary social structures to persist? I explore this
question with reference to examples of contemporary literary treatments
of extinction from select English-speaking settler-colonial contexts:
South Africa, Australia, and Canada.15 The next section of this article
traces key elements of extinction narrative in a range of
settler-colonial texts, while the section that follows offers a detailed
reading of one of the best examples of a sustained literary exploration
of human finitude, Margaret Atwood's Maddaddam trilogy (2003--2013). I
advance four specific arguments. First, extinction narratives take at
least two forms depending on whether the 'end' of settler society is
framed primarily in historical-civilizational terms or in a stronger,
biological sense; the key question is whether the 'thing' that is going
extinct is a society or a species. Second, biologically oriented
extinction narratives rely on a more or less conscious slippage between
'the settler' and 'the human'. Third, this slippage is ideologically
ambivalent: on the one hand, it contains a radical charge that invokes
environmentalist discourse and climate-change anxiety to imagine social
forms that re-write settler-colonial dynamics; on the other, it
replicates a core aspect of imperialist ideology by normalizing
whiteness as equivalent to humanity. Fourth, these ideological effects
are mediated by gender, insofar as extinction narratives invoke issues
of biological reproduction, community protection, and violence that
function to differentiate and reify masculine and feminine roles in the
putative de-colonial future. Overall, my central claim is that
[[extinction is a]{.mark} core [trope through which **settler futurity
emerges**]{.mark}, one with crucial narrative and ideological effects
that shape much of the contemporary literature emerging from white
colonial settings.]{.underline}

[Western scientists are proclaiming the start of a 'sixth mass
extinction event' that may involve the destruction of more than three
quarters of earth's currently-existing life forms]{.underline}. In their
attempts to explain this phenomenon, most scientists have converged
around four major, interlinked drivers: climate change, habitat
destruction, species exchange, and the direct killing of plants and
animals. In most cases, these drivers are understood as the unintended
consequences of generic 'human' activity, and as a result of desirable
trends such as development or urbanization (Wilson 2002; Barnosky 2014;
Ceballos 2016). [A crucial driver is missing from this list:
[transversal **structural violence** against Indigenous peoples]{.mark}
and their relations, and colonial violence in particular. 'Structural
violence' [involves systemic forms of harm, exclusion and
discrimination]{.mark} that disproportionately affect particular groups,
and which can take many forms]{.underline} (physical, psychological,
economic, gendered and others). [They are [embedded in]{.mark} and
expressed through [political]{.mark}, [cultural, economic]{.mark} and
social [structures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Farmer 2009) [[that]{.mark} can
[persist]{.mark} across large spans of time and space.]{.underline} I
use the term 'transversal' to refer to forms of structural
[violence]{.underline} that [extend across multiple
boundaries]{.underline} -- not only those of nation-states, but also
other kinds of nations (human and otherwise), communities or kinship
groups, and temporalities. [Prime examples of transversal structural
violence include: settler [colonialism]{.mark}, colonial
[genocides]{.mark}]{.underline} (Woolford et al 2014); [[environmental
racism]{.mark} or 'slow violence', including toxification and pollution;
[and complexes of sexual]{.mark}, [physical, communal, spiritual and
land-based violence associated with]{.mark} the extractive
[industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Each]{.mark} of these [form]{.mark}s
[of violence is]{.mark} ecologically
**[devastating]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and their convergence in European
projects of colonisation is even more so. [Many formations of
[transversal structural violence are significant causes of]{.mark} the
so-called 'four horsemen' of **[extinction]{.mark}** mentioned
above]{.underline}. For instance, '[direct killing' is carried out to
clear land for settlement, and it occurs as a result of ecological
damage caused by resource extraction. [Settler
colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, carbon-based economies and regimes of
environmental racism also support forms of socio-economic organization
(for instance, carbon and energy-intensive urbanized societies) that
[[intensify climate change]{.mark} and increase habitat
destruction]{.underline}. Meanwhile, colonization has played a
significant role in the ongoing transfer of life forms across the planet
-- whether unintentionally (e.g. the transfer of fish in the bilge water
of ships); as an instrument of agricultural settlement (e.g. cattle
ranching), or as a deliberate strategy of violence (e.g. smallpox).
However, [transversal [structural violence is a driver of **extinction
in itself**]{.mark}, with its own distinct manifestations]{.underline}.
First, [it involves the disruption or severance of relations and kinship
structures between human communities and other life forms, and [the
dissolution of Indigenous systems of governance]{.mark}, laws and
protocols that have co-created and sustained plural worlds over
millennia]{.underline} (Borrows 2010; Atleo 2012; Kimmerer 2013).
Second, [the [destruction of]{.mark} Indigenous [knowledges
through]{.mark} policies of [assimilation]{.mark},
[expropriation]{.mark}, **[cultural appropriation]{.mark}** and other
strategies [undermine]{.mark}s these forms of order and the
[relationships]{.mark} they nurture.]{.underline} Third, the
displacement of and/or restricted access to land by Indigenous peoples
interferes with practices of caring for land or Country that are
necessary for the survival of humans and other life forms (Bawaka
Country 2015[). [Colonial genocides embody all]{.mark} of these **[forms
of destruction]{.mark}** by [killing or displacing]{.mark} Indigenous
[communities]{.mark}, undermining Indigenous modes of governance and
kinship systems, systematically destroying relationships between life
forms [and erasing knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline} All of [these modes
of violence weaken co-constitutive relationships between Indigenous
communities, other life forms and ecosystems that have enabled their
collaborative survival. This results in disruptions to ecosystems -- and
climate]{.underline} -- that Potawatomi scholar Kyle Powys Whyte (2016)
has recently argued would have been considered a dystopia by his
Ancestors. In other words, [transversal structural violence, and
[colonial violence]{.mark} in particular, [are]{.mark} fundamental
[drivers of global]{.mark} patterns of [extinction]{.mark}. It stands to
reason, then, that [responses to extinction that focus on
managing]{.mark} endangered species or [populations]{.mark}, or 'backing
up' genetic material, [are insufficient]{.mark}: [they leave]{.mark} the
structures of [**violence intact** and]{.mark} may **[add to their
power]{.mark}**. [Instead]{.mark}, efforts to address extinction [need
to focus on]{.mark} identifying, confronting and **[dismantling these
formations]{.mark}** of violence, and on restoring or strengthening the
relations they sever.]{.underline}

[Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic are facing threats to their
livelihoods due to industrial development. This includes]{.underline}
the destruction of caribou pastures and [ecosystem degradation caused by
industrial infrastructure, pollution, and sea ice loss]{.underline}
(Normann 2021; Cunsolo et al. 2020). High Rangifer tarandus mortality
has serious implications for the future of Arctic nomadism (Forbes et
al. 2016, 2022). The construction of hydroelectric power dams has led to
the flooding of valuable subsistence areas and increased pollutants in
the Arctic (Schartupet al. 2015). Forest fires are becoming more
frequent in some regions due to factors like poaching, increased
recreational activities near industrial areas, climate change,
lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity (Rein and Huang
2021;McCarty et al. 2021). The [[early-season fires and fires on
permafrost are becoming more severe]{.underline}]{.mark}. These fires,
including "zombie fires" that smolder underground, have significant
local and global impacts, including the acceleration of thawing
permafrost and increased carbon emissions (McCarty, Smith, and Turetsky
2020).

The historical legacy of colonization and climate change have
contributed to the long-term infrastructural vulnerability in the Arctic
(Povoroznyuk et al. 2022), and is linked to con- temporary exposure to
hazards and increased vulnerability (Marino 2012). For instance, [[in
coastal Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} and northern Canada, traditionally
[[mobile groups were forcibly relocated into fixed settlements, which
arc now susceptible to the rising sea levels]{.mark} caused by climate
change and experiencing adaptation challenges]{.underline} (Magnan et
al. 2022; Bronen and Chapin 2013). These examples highlight the complex
interplay between climate change, nonclimatic factors, and historical
processes in shaping vulnerability.

Indigenous knowledge holders\' observations are important for
understanding the impact of climate change on ecosystems and societies,
and they have observed unprecedented temperature increases, altered
precipitation patterns, and changed weather patterns in the Arctic,
affecting both terrestrial and marine environments (Savo et al. 2016;
Reyes-Garcia et al. 2024). [Arctic societies have shown resilience to
climate change, but [vulnerabilities are emerging due to changing
environmental conditions and socioeconomic
pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ford et al. 2021). [[Radon]{.mark}, a
leading cause of lung cancer, [has higher death rates in Arctic
communities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Glover and Blouin 2022). [The
[thawing]{.mark} of [permafrost]{.mark} due to climate change [could
expose a large Arctic population to dangerous levels of radon, leading
to increased cancer]{.mark} cases]{.underline}. [[This would impact
health services, building codes, and ventilation]{.mark}
advice]{.underline} (Glover and Blouin 2022). [[Livelihoods and cultural
activities linked to subsistence harvesting have been impacted by
changes to wildlife, worsened by long-term land dispossession and
landscape fragmentation]{.underline}]{.mark} (Ford et al. 2021). Snow
cover duration in the Arctic has shortened by 2 to 4 days per decade,
while sea ice extent and volume have decreased, contributing to global
sea-level rise (Box et al. 2019). [[Higher temperatures and drier
conditions have increased the risk of wildfires]{.underline}]{.mark},
disrupting the carbon cycle and affecting Arctic ecosystems (Romanovsky
et al. 2017; Vihma et al. 2016).

Arctic communities are experiencing the effects of climate change due to
their dependence on climate-sensitive resources and environments for
livelihoods, such as wildlife and sea ice, and the cultural significance
of harvesting, preparation, consumption, and sharing (Kenny et al.
2018). [The increased activities in the Arctic have led to a range of
environmental consequences impacting the sustainability and cultural
considerations of inhabitants in]{.underline} states of Norway, Russia,
USA/[Alaska]{.underline}, Canada, and Greenland/Denmark. These changes
have widespread consequences for local communities, affecting their
livelihoods, well-being, and food security (Huntington et al. 2023;
Osmundsen 2023; Richard et al. 2023). Arctic coasts arc experiencing
rapid change, particularly during the sea ice-free period. [The [erosion
of permafrost coasts in Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}, Canada, and Siberia
[has [doubled]{.mark} since the early 2000s due to anthropogenic
warming]{.underline} (Irrgang et al. 2022). [The [livelihood, health,
and cultural identity of Arctic communities are impacted, as are their
access to food availability, herding, hunting, fishing, foraging, and
gathering places]{.mark}]{.underline} (Meredith et al. 2019).
Consequently, [[these communities have encountered compromised food
security, escalating risks linked to]{.mark} traditional practices like
hunting, fishing, and trapping, and [constraints on hunting]{.mark}
during specific periods]{.underline} (Ford and Pearce 2010; Harper et
al. 2012). [T[hese circumstances have affected mental health and are
linked to the occurrence of ecological grief]{.underline}]{.mark} [due
to ecological losses caused by environmental change]{.underline}
(Cunsolo and Ellis 2018). [The mental well-being of Arctic communities
is affected by the rapid environmental changes resulting from climate
change, which disrupts the relationship between people, places,
livelihoods, and culture]{.underline}s (Middleton et al. 2020). The
rapid reduction of the number and access to Rangifer tarandus for
harvesting, as well as the subsequent impacts on food systems, cultural
continuity, community relationships, and health and well-being in the
circumpolar north, have been connected to ecological grief (Cunsolo et
al. 2020; Borish et al. 2021).

Political ecology asserts that global capitalism expands and exploits
natural resources, resulting in environmental degradation and social
inequality, affecting nature and society (Harvey 2010). [Capitalist
practices such as land grabbing and privatization result in
\"accumulation by dispossession\" and dispossess communities, creating
environmental injustices]{.underline} (Harvey 2018), which is evident at
several places in the Arctic (Medby 2019; Shaw 2017). Political ecology
is useful to understand how Indigenous Peoples are disproportionately
affected by climate change and how global environmental change and
vulnerability are the result of the nexus of ideas, institutions, and
interests that have combined to accumulate power at the expense of
people and the planet (Robbins 2012; Barnett 2020). Arctic Political
Ecology addresses climate change impacts by integrating diverse
knowledge systems, examining power dynamics, advocating
interdisciplinary research, and ensuring comprehensive and equitable
climate policies. This approach emphasizes the importance of
environmental and climate justice, incorporating local and Indigenous
voices and governance frameworks to respond effectively to climate
change.

#### Native Alaskans are locked out of current adaptation planning -- it replicates ongoing colonialism

[[Many national governments prioritise neoliberal development and
resource extraction]{.mark} (mining, oil, and gas), while Indigenous
governance systems advocate for sustainable resource
management]{.underline} 103, 32••, 92. In Norway, the government's focus
on oil and gas development often conflicts with Indigenous demands for
sustainable resource management \[33\]. This prioritisation of resource
extraction over environmental and cultural preservation acts as a
barrier to adaptation. In Russia, large-scale oil and gas projects ---
such as those in the Yamal Peninsula --- have led to forced relocations
of Nenets and Evenki reindeer herders, significantly reducing their
ability to maintain traditional migration routes 107, 44. [In
Alaska]{.underline} and Canada, [[governments continue to grant resource
extraction permits on Indigenous lands, despite widespread
resistance]{.mark} from Indigenous communities]{.underline} 28, 5.
[[The]{.mark} oil drilling [Willow Project in Alaska]{.mark}, approved
in 2023, has [faced intense opposition from Indigenous activists]{.mark}
who argue that it will increase environmental destruction, disrupt
wildlife migration patterns, and accelerate permafrost
thawing]{.underline} \[31\]. However, [[the project was still approved,
highlighting]{.mark} how [governance systems]{.mark} frequently
[privilege economic interests over Indigenous sovereignty and long-term
climate resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Indigenous communities are often marginalised in]{.mark} governance,
[decision-making processes, adaptation planning]{.mark}, and
consultation in resource extraction and face challenges in asserting
their rights and interests]{.underline} 103, 97. [[This exclusion
creates significant barriers to adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
policies that do not incorporate Indigenous perspectives often fail to
address the realities of Arctic life.

Many of the [[governance failures in the Arctic are rooted in]{.mark}
historical and [**ongoing** colonialism, resulting in land dispossession
and forced relocation,]{.mark} which have collectively impeded
and,]{.underline} in certain cases, [severed the important connections
of Indigenous Peoples with their ancestral territories]{.underline} 47,
65••. In many cases, these colonial structures do not just act as
barriers but as limits --- where Indigenous communities have permanently
lost land, mobility, and self-governance, making adaptation
fundamentally more difficult. [In]{.underline} Canada [and Alaska, many
Indigenous communities were forcibly relocated to permanent settlements,
disrupting lifestyles, traditional hunting practices, and
climate-adaptive mobility patterns]{.underline} 17, 69. [These
[relocations have had lasting impacts on food security, mental health,
and cultural preservation, creating a structural limit to
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline} \[25\].

Colonialism and injustice have evolved into government policies limiting
access to resources such as small-scale Indigenous Peoples' fisheries
and favouring offshore trawlers, resulting in historical and present-day
inequities in the fishing sector \[94\]. [Historical, interpersonal,
epistemic, and [systemic racism has created socioeconomic disparities,
limiting access to health care, education, resources, and economic
opportunities and affected the health and well-being of Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} 24, 59••. This presents a limit and
undermines the adaptive capacity.

[Colonisation has systematically turned the natural constraints in the
Arctic into severe socioeconomic barriers by undermining Indigenous
autonomy and severing traditional adaptation strategies]{.underline}
\[••65\]. [Forced sedentarisation, land dispossession, and restrictive
resource governance have stripped Indigenous communities of their
ability to flexibly respond to environmental challenges]{.underline}
\[104\]. [[Colonial policies have reinforced the infrastructural
limitations --- **investing in resource extraction rather than local
development**]{.underline}, [leaving Indigenous communities with high
costs of living, food insecurity, and limited access to essential
services]{.underline}]{.mark} 55, 90. [What were once manageable
ecological limits have thus been compounded by imposed social,
political, and economic constraints, shaping the structural inequalities
that define contemporary Arctic adaptation challenges]{.underline}.

Colonialism has created both barriers and limits to adaptation by
forcibly relocating Indigenous communities to environmentally unsuitable
and high-risk areas, where traditional hunting and fishing practices are
no longer viable. While initially a barrier, this displacement has
evolved into a structural limit, as these communities are now deeply
established, making relocation impractical despite increasing climate
risks. State-imposed wildlife regulations restrict Indigenous adaptive
flexibility, preventing communities from adjusting their subsistence
practices in response to environmental changes \[22\]. These policies,
often designed without Indigenous input, reinforce colonial constraints
on adaptation, further limiting the agency of Arctic Indigenous Peoples
in navigating climate challenges.

President [Obama]{.underline} also [designated the Denali Commission the
central coordinator of the federal effort to build climate resilience in
Alaska, but the Commission lacked the authority to direct any other
federal agency.]{.underline}274 In addition[, [the Denali Commission had
**insufficient funding** to carry out relocations for the number of
communities that urgently need assistance in
Alask]{.mark}]{.underline}[a.]{.mark}275 The Denali Commission's 2020
proposed work plan reallocated funding for this work, substantially
limiting the Commission's effectiveness in fulfilling its total role.276

The GAO reviewed these efforts in a 2020 report, concluding that
"[**[unclear federal leadership]{.underline}** [is the **key challenge**
to climate migration]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a resilience
strategy]{.underline}"277 and advocating for a climate migration pilot
program.278 The report builds on several previous reports documenting
the federal government's failure to respond to the needs of communities
requiring relocation and the increasing federal fiscal exposure due to
natural disasters.279 In June 2020, the U.S. House Select Committee on
the Climate Crisis reaffirmed the need to create a governance framework
and protect the human rights of those displaced:

> Congress should direct the \[Mitigation Framework Leadership Group\]

### S - Denali Commission

#### The Denali Commission solves better than a new agency

//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

[Even if a new climate change adaptation agency were created, it would
face challenges to carrying out its mission. It would have to find a way
to integrate its]{.underline} regulations and [policies with the ongoing
efforts of the Denali Commission,]{.underline} FEMA, the Army Corps, and
other major players in ANV adaptation. [It would have to compete with
existing agencies and programs for limited funding]{.underline}.

If created at the national level, [a new agency might not be able to
adequately provide for the unique needs of Alaska related to its Arctic
terrain; sparsely populated, remote villages; and the large percentage
of federally recognized tribes. The Denali Commission may be better
suited to addressing these needs within the State of Alaska, avoiding
the need for a separate, stand-alone state climate change
agency]{.underline}. The flexibility of its enabling law and the
inclusion of state and federal agency representatives in its governing
board have allowed it to play a lead role in coordinating and carrying
out adaptation actions in ANVs---most notably the relocation of Newtok.
[The Commission can combine and transfer different sources of funding
available to communities more easily than other agencies
can]{.underline}. Also, [the Commission has been able to pursue an
equitable agenda where communities throughout Alaska are entitled to
similar services, regardless of their remoteness]{.underline}.15

#### Current structure of federal assistance to Native Alaskan communities pits them against each other. The Denali Commission can provide better coordination and technical assistance for Alaskan infrastructure

**McKinley Research** Group, 20**23** -- Consulting firm in Anchorage
Alaska. No author listed, but the report is based on interviews with 30
individuals representing organizations in Alaska, including the Denali
Commission, seven rural tribes, 8 tribal organizations, and the US
Arctic Research Commission "ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES AND THE DENALI

//DH

[While federal money may appear to be plentiful, it can be extremely
hard for rural Alaska communities to access]{.underline}. The
disconnects run deep. Many interviewees said federal agency programs are
not designed to meet the needs of rural Alaska. One said, "Decision
makers live outside and enabling legislation is designed for the average
municipality in the Lower 48."

Federal studies give credence to such claims. For example, a 2022 report
by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed federal
efforts to help Alaska Native villages address environmental threats.
The report found that "much more needs to be done to protect" these
villages from threats such as erosion, flooding, and thawing permafrost.
The report noted:

[Of the more than 30 federal programs that could help, most are hard for
Native villages to access]{.underline}. For example, [programs that
require participants to share costs with the government can be out of
reach for small villages.]{.underline}7

The GAO report recommended agencies remove obstacles and barriers to
help Alaska Native villages obtain federal assistance.

Interviews for this project helped shed light on why such changes are
needed, and how very challenging the barriers are. For example, even
something as ubiquitous as the internet is problematic for many rural
Alaska communities.

"Everything is on the internet, and we lack broadband internet," said a
former tribal administrator. "We were trying to get a CARES Act report
in and before everything was uploaded we lost our internet and had to
start over." This can make applying for funding feel like a circular
logic problem: How does one get broadband when the application for
broadband funding requires reliable internet service?

One administrator devised an emergency workaround through a consultant
in urban Alaska: "When we needed to get stuff submitted, I was able to
work with \[the consultant\] by fax and they could submit it using their
broadband." However, retaining a competent and reliable consultant
requires money and coordination beyond the reach of some villages.

A more subtle challenge is competition. [Many funds are distributed to
rural communities on a competitive basis]{.underline}, or on a
priority-list system. [This]{.underline} system [inherently favors
communities with grant writing skills and resources -- which may not
align with need]{.underline}.

One former tribal administrator expressed a sense of hopelessness in
getting their village's needs to the top of agency priority lists. "It's
difficult for communities as small as ours to compete."

In addition to fairness concerns, [the system can take a toll on
relationships, and can undermine long traditions of cooperation between
neighboring communities]{.underline}. One interviewee said [grant
competition pits small communities against each other]{.underline} --
often for small amounts of money. "[It's like having a pack of wolves go
after scraps]{.underline}."

A tribal leader in a 400-person village compared the situation to tiny
village schools playing the biggest teams in basketball: "We have
shovel-ready projects, but we're competing against giants. It's like 1A
teams playing against 4A teams."

Some communities get help from larger entities. But this can have costs
as well. One tribal administrator said that by the time funds make it to
their village, much has gone to intermediaries: "We could apply for a
\$100,000 grant but by the time it reaches us it's so diminished because
of other agencies taking cuts. And for our small village, we're lucky to
get \$15,000 to run our office."

In many villages, a tribal coordinator or other position will assume
duties far beyond typical administrative tasks, such as village safety,
emergency repairs, and utility operations. [Capacity in a small remote
village for grant writing is limited, and many said it is not realistic
to expect these small communities to have the time and tools to
compete]{.underline}.

An interviewee from a regional organization said they appreciated
set-asides in many funding streams for underserved communities, but it's
not enough:

> The foundation has not been laid for Tribes and communities to be able
> to use the funding. You have to be a grant writer. The money might be
> available to work on the project you need, but if none of the training
> or technical assistance or capacity building has been done, you see a
> grant and it's like, 'Ok cool, I have no idea how to tackle that.'

[The need for ongoing and individually tailored technical support is
acute. Yet]{.underline} [federal agencies themselves often lack capacity
to provide the level of support needed.]{.underline}

In sum, [there is both need for funding in rural Alaska and
*availability* of federal funds for rural Alaska, but capacity
constraints on both sides threaten to undermine the impact of these
funds]{.underline}. Interviewees expressed concern that there is a real
risk of rural Alaska needs going unmet while funds intended to address
those needs go unspent or are poorly spent.

Many [interviewees said the Denali Commission could play a unique and
valuable role in averting such an outcome and helping ensure real impact
of federal funds in rural Alaska]{.underline}.8 [Given its mission,
experience, and statutory powers, there is arguably no agency better
situated than the Denali Commission to help bridge the disconnect
between federal policy and rural Alaska reality]{.underline}.

#### Empirically -- the Denali Commission can build trust and meet community needs, reduces bureaucracy and increases flexibility

**McKinley Research** Group, 20**23** -- Consulting firm in Anchorage

individuals representing organizations in Alaska, including the Denali
Commission, seven rural tribes, 8 tribal organizations, and the US
Arctic Research Commission "ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES AND THE DENALI
COMMISSION"

//DH

[Many cited the commission's successes. The most frequently cited
achievements were the bulk fuel storage program]{.underline} (the
commission's first major program) [and construction of village health
clinics in partnership with Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium.]{.underline}

[Another lauded the "phenomenal work" of the commission in advancing
relocation of the village of Newtok amidst a panoply of bureaucratic
hurdles]{.underline}, [saying, "State and federal agency
programs]{.underline} and policies **[were prohibitive]{.underline}**
[and the Denali Commission stepped in to **remove the
barriers**]{.underline} as best they could."

One interviewee said that while most federal funding programs are
designed with little thought to or understanding of rural Alaska, "[The
Denali Commission]{.underline} on the whole [is far more effective at
investing resources in a way that has a tangible benefit to
communities]{.underline} on the ground."

Unique Flexibilities

"Ted Stevens got a pretty unusual piece of legislation adopted to really
make it easier to connect state and federal agency work in a way that
reduces some of the bureaucracy. It is an important thing to continue."
Many interviewees noted [the Denali Commission has several powers and
flexibilities that are unusual among federal agencies.]{.underline}

Ability to turn lapsing money into "no-year" money

[While most federal agencies receive time-limited appropriations, the
Denali Commission's monies do not lapse or expire]{.underline}. In the
federal funding lexicon, this means money appropriated to the commission
becomes "no-year" money -- even if it is transferred to the commission
from an agency where money has a lapse date. As many pointed out, this
is a crucial tool. In a time of glut -- which Alaska is arguably
entering -- [it means monies can be appropriately paced]{.underline}.
This could enable the commission to help smooth out funding, providing
funders an opportunity to slow down and do a better job of prioritizing,
vetting, and supporting projects.

[One interviewee gave an example of a federal agency that is turning
over a chunk of money from another "highly bureaucratic" federal agency
to the Denali Commission to gain flexibility: "We can turn it into
no-year money and then slowly take the time to develop it
effectively]{.underline}." According to the interview, this partnership
with the commission will enable managers to accomplish much more with
the money.

Ability to comingle different funding streams

Several interviewees suggested the Denali Commission's relative
flexibility could enable it to serve as a funding aggregator for
projects with mixed federal funding streams.

The commission can also fill in gaps, as one interviewee said it did for
Newtok's relocation: "\[The Denali Commission\] used their funding,
which was not as limited as other federal agencies, to fill the gaps
that were preventing other state and federal agencies from implementing
what the Tribe needed."

Ability to provide "nonfederal" match

Also key is the Denali Commission's ability to provide money that
typically counts as non-federal match (regardless of its original
source) for the purposes of meeting grant requirements. Providing
matching funds helps communities that are unable to raise that money
locally and enables Denali Commission dollars to go further than if the
commission paid for 100 percent of a given project. Interviewees noted
that systems would need to be developed to address cash f low
complexities involved in providing match funding at the right time.
"This will take staff that know the communities, know the players in
rural Alaska and how to incentivize partnerships."

Ability to right-size requirements

As described in the previous section, [federal grant requirements can be
notoriously onerous, particularly for small remote
communities]{.underline} where a tribal administrator may maintain the
water system and fill in as a peace officer, and where basic amenities
are often lacking. As one interviewee said, "Some of our grantees have
to climb a hill to get a cell signal to make a call or turn things in at
the beginning of the month before the internet is shut off."

[The Denali Commission is less burdened than other federal agencies by
rules that don't make sense for rural Alaska. The commission has the
power to adjust or "right-size" requirements to minimize the barriers
rural communities face in getting the funding they need]{.underline}.

Community relocation is extraordinarily complex, requiring the movement
of people and many different types of infrastructure, both public and
private. [Collaborative governance is a form of institutional design
that allows for collective action and takes advantage of the expertise
of a variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations to
achieve a public policy goal]{.underline}.292 [In the context of
community-led relocation, a multilevel interagency collaborative
organizational structure is critical for accessing the combined
capabilities of tribal, local, state, and federal government
agencies]{.underline}. [This interagency structure also must serve as a
vehicle for coordinating the resources and technical assistance provided
by state and federal agencies,]{.underline} non-profit organizations,
[and tribal and local governments.]{.underline} In a draft report
discussing the unmet needs of environmentally threatened communities in
Alaska, an 'all of government coordinating framework' was identified as
one of the seven key messages critical to the facilitation of a
community-wide relocation.293 The report noted:

> Addressing environmental threats requires knowledge of all types of
> rural infrastructure development and coordination with the associated
> technical assistance organizations and funding agencies. Consequently,
> [most small, remote communities do not yet have the capability and
> capacity to navigate the myriad objectives and limitations of the
> hundreds of programs and processes necessary to develop and implement
> solutions to environmental threats]{.underline}. [For some
> communities, it can be like trying to assemble a 10,000-piece puzzle
> without a picture painted on it.]{.underline} Furthermore, [efforts to
> support communities that have been attached to one administration or
> agency executive have been abandoned by the next]{.underline}. There
> is neither comprehensive, multi-agency collaboration to address
> environmental threats nor formal coordination between state and
> federal activities. **[Lack of federal leadership is the root
> cause]{.underline}** [of the limited progress made to
> date]{.underline} (GAO, 2020). To create efficiencies and support
> communities throughout all stages of addressing environmental threats,
> [both a lead funding agency and an all-of-government coordination
> framework are needed]{.underline}.294

[This federal collaborative governance framework needs to create the
parameters for replication by state and local governing
entities.]{.underline} At the state level, interagency government
collaboration is critical to (1) create a statewide system to identify
imperiled communities and relocation sites, (2) create the mechanisms to
engage host communities and facilitate collaboration between them and
communities seeking relocation, (3) coordinate interagency data
gathering and analysis, and (4) develop funding strategies to ensure
that communities seeking relocation are prioritized and that funding can
be leveraged between different state, federal, and local revenue
streams. Collaborative governance at the local level is also important
to plan the phased relocation process, including the building or
remodeling of infrastructure, the movement of people, and the
abandonment of the original community location.

### S - remove fund matching and competitive grants

#### Removing competitive grant and fund matching requirements is vital to allow Alaska Native Villages to qualify for federal funds

//DH

[Congress needs to create a mechanism for the coordinated release of
funding or the streamlining of different agency grant-making
processes]{.underline} to make the acquisition of funding more
efficient. [Federal]{.underline} government [agencies should be
authorized to set aside funding specifically to provide technical and
financial assistance for a community-wide relocation effort if it is
determined to be the best long-term adaptation strategy]{.underline} for
an environmentally-threatened community. Once these criteria are
reached, the lead federal agency should be able to access these
resources across the federal system so that the relocation effort is
cost-efficient.

Federal housing, disaster relief, and other grant programs should
include set-asides or priorities for environmentally-threatened tribes
in order to better meet their needs. They should also consider cultural
resources, reduced match requirements, and fair award criteria.

Set asides or priorities for environmentally threatened tribes:
Environmentally-threatened tribes are among the communities most
dramatically affected by climate change. [Tribes also have fewer
economic and staffing resources to address these threats than urban
population centers]{.underline}.318 The need to address the threats is
urgent, and [federal grant programs should reflect that urgency by
creating set-asides for environmentally-threatened tribes to ensure that
the communities that most need assistance have equitable access to
funding.]{.underline}

Reduced match requirements: [Federal cost-sharing requirements make
grant programs inaccessible to Alaska Native tribes most in need of
assistance]{.underline}.319 [Many Alaska Native communities are small
and rural with low per capita income and no local tax
base]{.underline}.320 [Requiring a local match for large projects can
make it infeasible for communities to obtain funding. Eliminating match
requirements would make federal grant programs more
equitable]{.underline} by ensuring that communities have access to
funding based on the need for funding, not based on their ability to
pay.321

Non-competitive funding: Change Cost-Benefit Analysis: [Competitive
grant awards and cost-benefit analysis generally favor large populations
in urban area]{.underline}s.322 [This]{.underline} type of analysis
[penalizes Alaska Native communities, where shipping and construction
costs are high, populations are low, and local economic resources are
minimal]{.underline}.323 When comparing the cost of preventing
destructive floods against the value of the public infrastructure in
rural Alaska Native villages, [flood control mitigation projects are
often denied because they are more expensive than the value of the
public infrastructure]{.underline}.324 [Cost-benefit analyses also fail
to take into account the impact of losing properties or materials that
provide cultural value to the community]{.underline}.325 If a fish camp
is lost to a flooding event, the loss may be monetarily insignificant
but substantial in terms of the resources needed to feed families
throughout the wintertime or the space used to teach the next generation
a critical skill. [When a cost-benefit analysis is required for a grant,
tribes should be permitted to include non-economic factors that reflect
cultural resources and needs]{.underline}. The risk climate change and
community relocations present to subsistence and community resilience is
enormous. Although it is difficult to calculate values for these
considerations, tribes should be permitted to include these calculations
in cost-benefit analyses to better reflect what is at stake.

by requiring a cost-benefit analysis as well as a cost share requirement
from non-federal sources]{.underline}.254 [Although the cost share
requirement is reduced to 10% for small and impoverished communities, it
will make it difficult for Alaska Native tribes to be eligible to
receive funding because they do not have a tax base from which to draw
the non-federal cost share]{.underline}.

Clearly, [the current federal government structure and government grant
programs designed to respond to environmental hazards are not able to
address the complexity, geographic scope, and scale of climate-forced
relocation]{.underline}. While government agencies may be able to use
land-use restrictions and acquisition programs as a way of managing
coastal retreat, these tools only allow for incremental adaptation and
are insufficient to respond to the complexity of mass population
displacement and the need to rebuild livelihoods, homes, and community
infrastructure in a new location.

### S - collaboration key

#### Collaboration can solve the harms of prior adaptation failures

//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

I begin with an explanation of why [collaboration is needed. While
Alaska Native families]{.underline} and clans [have planned for their
own well-being for thousands of years, the current
circumstances]{.underline} (outlined as follows) [may require assistance
from external entities to plan for climate change]{.underline}
(Stoyanova 2013, p. 310; Wildcat 2013, p. 511). First, [[ANVs lack
jurisdiction over their traditional lands and natural
resource]{.mark}s]{.underline} (see 43 U.S.C. §1603), [[such that they
must cooperate with]{.underline}]{.mark} local, state, and [[federal
entities regarding land use]{.underline}]{.mark} or game management.
[Second, [ANVs are often small and impoverished communities without
their own tax base]{.mark}]{.underline} (AK Division of Community and
Regional Affairs 2018). [[Many have little in the way of environmental
staff,]{.mark} let alone climatologists, planners, or engineers [to
develop adaptation plans]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Hence, [[many
ANVs that want climate change adaptation plans]{.mark} or HMPs [must
rely on external funding and consultants]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Third,
climate change in ANVs is occurring much more rapidly than elsewhere in
the United States, contributing to significant flooding, erosion, and
impacts to subsistence hunting and fishing]{.underline} (Chapin et al.
2014, p. 536; Field et al. 2014, p. 32; Stewart et al. 2013). [[Even if
ANVs had the means to draft plans, they often lack the resources needed
to carry out large-scale adaptation measures such as
relocation]{.underline}]{.mark} (Klein, Midgley, and Preston 2014, p.
907).

[[The need for external assistance does not necessitate a repeat of past
planning mistakes]{.mark}. Instead, **[planning can be a collaborative
process]{.mark}** [that harnesses the resources of external entities as
well as those of the community]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the
collaborative planning literature, [[this kind of collaboration
generally requires a process of consensus building between participants
who have roughly equal authority in the
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark} and are committed to working together
(Margerum 2008, p. 487; Focht and Trachtenberg 2005, p. 124; Lubell et
al. 2005, p. 262; Sabatier et al. 2005, p. 4; Sabatier, Weible, and
Ficker 2005, p. 24). Particularly with indigenous groups, planning
processes need to recognize community knowledge and values alongside
Western science (Berkes, Kofinas, and Chapin 2009, pp. 124, 141; Kofinas
2009, p. 79).

It is important to not confuse true collaboration with other forms of
interaction that may fail to adequately integrate ANV needs, knowledge,
and values. [Arnstein]{.underline} (1969) [pointed out that not all
forums for public participation are really meaningful]{.underline}.
Rather, [she described a "ladder" of participation]{.underline} with
eight levels, ranging [from]{.underline} "non-participation" (including
manipulation and therapy), followed by the "**[tokenism]{.underline}**"
levels ([informing, consultation, and placation), and finishing with
citizen power (partnership, delegated power, and citizen control). True
collaborative planning would be closer to the top of the
ladder]{.underline}.

#### Collaboration is the core of climate adaptation -- Alaskan Native Villages won't implement plans without it

E. Barrett **Ristroph**, 20**18** -- A DISSERTATION SUBMITTED TO THE
GRADUATE DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I AT MĀNOA IN PARTIAL

IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING "HOW CAN LAWS, INSTITUTIONS, AND PLANS
FACILITATE ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGE ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE?" Proquest
//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages; HMPs = Hazard Management Plans**

What perhaps sets my findings apart from other studies on planning
processes is the stark difference between the participants in the Alaska
planning processes that I studied. [At one end are ANVs---often small
and remote, with distinct values, needs, and lifeways]{.underline} that
persist in the face of climate change and colonization. [At the other
end are urban-based planners and decisionmakers leading Western-style
planning processes with little oversight]{.underline} or evaluation
across this expansive state. [ANVs]{.underline} have little involvement
in the initiation and process of outside-led planning, and they [lack
the means to implement these plans on their own terms]{.underline}.
Thus, even while some outside planners see the process of planning as
helpful to ANVs, [the current process]{.underline} is not translating
traditional means of indigenous planning into planning documents that
serve the ANV needs. Rather, it [produces plans that may be factually
inaccurate and impossible to implement and amounts to a failure of
climate justice]{.underline}.

[ANVs adaptation to climate change will be achieved not by external
entities cranking out generic plans for ANVs. Each ANV will need to come
together with a common vision and support local leadership to build on
that vision in collaboration with external partners]{.underline}. In
turn, external partners should make the effort to ensure that planning
is carried out in a manner that fosters meaningful participation from
ANVs.

#### Prior governance failures were due to micropolitics -- implementation breaks down from the failure to engage Alaskan Native communities directly

[Rural environmental adaptation poses urgent challenges]{.underline} for
policymakers and societies. The World Bank estimates that as many as 216
million people in vulnerable regions will be internally displaced by
climate-related events by 2050 (Clement et al. 2021). [The scale and
urgency]{.underline} of this multi-faceted problem [require aligning
governments and NGOs to support community-scale adaptation while
minimizing suffering and loss of autonomy]{.underline}. [This is
particularly true for Indigenous communities, whose ongoing battles for
self-determination are doubly threatened, as both environmental change
and adaptation]{.underline} ([e.g., forced relocation]{.underline}) [can
impinge upon sovereignty]{.underline}.

Climate change, with its dynamic hazard landscape and shifting
baselines, poses a unique set of challenges for disaster response and
hazard mitigation (Wilby and Keenan 2012). [Many well-intentioned rural
climate adaptation efforts fall short of their goals, often due to a
combination of poor program design, ineffective goal-setting, and
fraught power dynamics]{.underline} (Pennington 2023). As a result, many
governments and institutions are developing novel legal, bureaucratic,
and technical frameworks for adaptation and resilience for threatened
communities. The past decade has seen a proliferation of such strategies
and policies to improve environmental adaptation and reduce
maladaptation (Barnett and O'Neill 2010; Ulibarri et al. 2022). These
new tools target diverse social and political landscapes, from small
island nations (Mcleod et al. 2019) to large cities (Anguelovski et al.
2014). Given the breadth of human societies and the myriad
manifestations of environmental change, strategies that work well in one
context are not necessarily well-suited to another.

[This paper uses the concept of micropolitics to draw attention to a
category of procedural failures in environmental adaptation that
are]{.underline} not policy failures per se, but [failures in the
implementation of these policies, particularly when deployed in
cross-cultural or colonial settings]{.underline}. These failures often
arise in mundane issues that are missed in the highlevel design of the
policies in question. They are adjacent to, but separate from, issues of
policy, goodwill, resource scarcity, or technical possibility.
[Micropolitics are not micro because they are small or unimportant, but
rather because they are fine-grained and easily overlooked]{.underline}.
[Resolving micropolitical issues requires improved attention to the
lived experiences of threatened communities and the dynamics that govern
their interactions with settler governments]{.underline}.

In the specific context of environmental adaptation, [micropolitical
issues include]{.underline} (but are hardly limited to) substandard
communication between communities and governments (Marino 2015);
[failure to incorporate systems of traditional knowledge and
governance]{.underline} into adaptation plans (Raymond-Yakoubian et al.
2017); [setting unrealistic expectations for small communities'
technical capacity]{.underline} (Minnes and Vodden 2017); [failure to
build trust]{.underline} (Whyte 2020); [and simple ignorance of
historical contexts]{.underline} that necessitate an intersectional
approach to adaptation planning (Marino 2012; Marter-Kenyon 2020; Whyte
2018).

This article explores the micropolitics of climate adaptation with a
focus on the Siberian Yupik and Iñupiaq villages of Western Alaska.1It
begins with a background on environmental adaptation challenges faced by
Tribal governments. This is followed by an overview of micropolitics,
noting how they appear in the process of environmental adaptation. A
case study then investigates Tribal-federal cooperation in response to
Typhoon Merbok, a recordbreaking storm in September 2022 that caused
major damage to dozens of Western Alaska Native communities. We conclude
with a set of recommendations for specific micropolitical issues in
environmental adaptation. These recommendations will have varying
degrees of transferability to other geographic and political contexts.

#### Failure of climate adaption for Indigenous communities is a micropolitical failure -- federal agencies routinely ignore input from Alaskan Native communities

[Climate adaptation for Indigenous communities is not as simple as
making good policy; it is equally about how policy is implemented and
how collaboration unfolds between settler governments and Indigenous
stakeholders. Rural Alaska Native villages are among the most
environmentally threatened communities in the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Their ability to effectively
manage environmental change and preserve sovereignty depends upon
successful collaboration with]{.underline} a range of stakeholders,
especially [federal agencies]{.underline}. For more than two decades,
[academics and government agencies have documented a consistent pattern
of failures]{.underline}, particularly **[by federal
actors]{.underline}**, [to effectively manage adaptation]{.underline}
challenges. These obstacles are sometimes misrepresented as policy
failures. [While poor policy is certainly involved]{.underline} in these
poor outcomes, [this paper highlights a set of barriers to successful
collaboration that are not policy issues, per se, but rather
micropolitical issues; that is, they pertain to the conduct of
government in the context of Tribal relationships]{.underline}.
[Unaddressed, these micropolitical issues have created obstacles to
Alaska Native communities' selfdetermination as they adapt to a changing
landscape.]{.underline} These barriers are explored in a case study
drawn from Typhoon Merbok, which struck Western Alaska in 2022, and
empirically grounded in a series of interviews and participant
observation with experts, elders, elected officials, and Tribal staff.
This article concludes with several concrete recommendations to improve
the practice of domestic diplomacy between Indigenous communities and
colonial governments.

#### Our authors' method involved direct interviews with Alaskan Natives

Norton Sound region of Western Alaska]{.underline}, conducted in 2022
and 2023. [Over 50 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Tribal
leaders, Tribal government staff, employees at regional Alaska Native
nonprofits, community leaders, and elders]{.underline}. Interviews were
supplemented with periods of participant observation (following Ingold
2014, 2017) with Tribal government staff during repeated stays (1--3
weeks) at two Alaska Native villages in the region. This involved
spending time in Tribal government offices, helping with various tasks,
including grant writing, distributing food for a community food bank,
and cross-referencing documents for annual tax filings.

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

Throughout this article, I have described planning processes that are
externally driven and not really reflective of community needs,
knowledge, and values. [Recognizing that ANVs will likely continue to
need external assistance with planning, I advocate a planning process
that is truly collaborative,]{.underline} harnessing the resources of
external entities as well as the insight of ANVs. This process should
attempt to build the capacity of local residents to meaningfully
participate in decision-making regarding planning goals and action
items. As it stands, ANV planning is closer to "manipulation" or
"consulting" on Arnstein's ladder than it is to citizen control or true
collaboration. In this subsection, I offer a couple of suggestions for
better collaboration.

A repeated theme in my interviews was that [outside
decision-makers]{.underline} and planners [should spend more time in
communities]{.underline}, rather than hoping that social capital will
blossom during a single public planning meeting. In my own experience as
a planner and lawyer, [I have been a part of many meetings where a large
number of representatives from an outside entity took a charter flight
into an ANV and stayed only for a three-hour public
meeting]{.underline}, leaving questions and concerns of ANV residents
unaddressed. [A better use of money could be for just one or two
representatives to take a commercial flight into the ANV and stay for a
few days, holding a public meeting as well as spending time in people's
homes]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[Addressing barriers and limits to climate change adaptation requires
transformative structural changes that recognise Indigenous rights,
knowledge, and sovereignty, and a move towards inclusive
governance.]{.underline} These changes can be achieved through targeted
policies and frameworks, such as the Arctic Council's Sustainable
Development Working Group, which facilitates collaboration on climate
resilience strategies grounded in Indigenous knowledge. [Initiatives
like co-management agreements between Indigenous communities and
national governments provide effective models for fostering inclusive
decision-making. Investing in resilient infrastructure, promoting
Indigenous knowledge systems, and ensuring social and economic equity
are important steps toward enhancing adaptation capacity and long-term
sustainability in the Arctic]{.underline}.

[The federal leader of the Denali Commission said]{.underline} [Friday
she is trying to save long-planned Alaska infrastructure projects now
threatened by]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [---
and the life of the independent federal commission itself.]{.underline}

Julie [Kitka]{.underline}, who [served for three decades as president of
the Alaska Federation of Natives before taking on the new
role]{.underline} in October [as federal co-chair of the Denali
Commission]{.underline}, discussed those challenges on Friday in Nome at
a conference organized by that city's government.

"I have to tell you that dealing with the new federal administration, I
had a mindset of, 'This is an administration unlike anything we've seen
in our lifetime,' so that's proved out," she said.

"Too, 'Urgency is the new normal,' and that's proved out," Kitka said at
the City of Nome Investment Summit.

The Denali Commission was founded in 1998 and modeled after the
Appalachian Regional Commission, which was established in1965. [The
Denali Commission coordinates rural Alaska infrastructure and economic
development planning among multiple agencies, and it disburses grants
for various projects]{.underline}, such as water and sewer systems,
telecommunications and health care facilities. It gets funding from the
federal government, through congressional appropriations and other
sources, and it is empowered to receive funding from nongovernmental
sources as well.

But now [it is jeopardized by the Trump]{.underline} administration's
[campaign to dramatically shrink the federal government.]{.underline}

Kitka said she met on Thursday with representatives of the "Department
of Government Efficiency," also known as DOGE, the ad-hoc team led by
billionaire Elon Musk that has directed mass firings and deep budget
cuts across federal agencies and programs.

Now [Kitka said she has three DOGE people assigned to shadow her and the
Denali Commission]{.underline}, putting her and her colleagues in the
position of defending its existence.

#### Alaskan Native renewables are extremely limited

Rebecca **Meadows,** 20**25** -- National Renewable Energy Lab
"Renewable Energy Integration in Remote Alaska Communities" January
<https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/90685.pdf> //DH

[There are]{.underline} approximately [200 remote Alaska villages that
are not connected to a larger grid and that primarily rely on diesel
generators for electricity]{.underline}. From 2019 to 2020, the annual
electricity generation consumed in the rural communities that
participate in Alaska's Power Cost Equalization (PCE) Program1 was 475
gigawatt-hours, approximately 10% of the electricity consumed in the
area from Fairbanks to Anchorage, known as the Railbelt[. Renewably
generated electricity accounted for approximately **10%** of the total
generation consumed in these rural communities]{.underline} and was
primarily from wind and hydropower resources (Meadows et al. 2023).

PCE reimburses rural utilities for eligible expenses, reducing
residential electrical rates in the communities they serve. In 2023, 188
communities participated in the PCE program (Alaska Energy Authority
2023). Because of the high cost of transporting diesel fuel to remote
locations, residential electricity rates for remote communities can
still be significantly more than the Railbelt, even with PCE (Allen et
al. 2016). Communities often use more diesel fuel for heating than for
electricity, with heating fuel bills consuming up to half of the total
household income in some communities (Holdmann n.d.).

As of 2020, approximately [70 rural Alaska communities had deployed a
renewable energy system]{.underline} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and reliance on costly imported diesel fuel (Huang 2020).
[However,]{.underline} in many of these communities,
[renewable]{.underline} energy [contribution levels have been limited
(typically around 20%) by insufficient integration systems and
maintenance obstacles]{.underline} (Jimenez 2018).

### 1ar -- DOGE cuts

#### DOGE will kill it dead (without the plan's fiat)

//DH

Over the past month, [DOGE also met several times with the Denali
Commission]{.underline} --- the single-state authority that has funded
rural infrastructure projects and economic development in Alaska since
1998. It also provides grants for other projects, such as a
telecommunications project on the North Slope.

"Dealing with the new federal administration, I had a mindset of, 'This
is an administration unlike anything we've seen in our lifetime,' so
that's proved out," JULIE [KITKA, co-chair of the Denali
Commission,]{.underline} said at an investment summit in Nome, Alaska,
in April as she reflected on the challenges to the commissions.

Kitka has [emphasized the dual value of infrastructure
projects]{.underline} funded by the commission: not only do they support
the local community, but they can also benefit the nation's military,
the Alaska Beacon has reported.

[Her argument did not seem to sway]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration. [When Trump's budget was released last week, it called
for the elimination of the Denali Commission]{.underline} and the five
other active ones --- sparing only Appalachia --- in order [to "reduce
the Federal role in local economic development initiatives" and "remove
an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy in an already bloated grant-making
system]{.underline}."

"States and local governments are better positioned to fund and address
unique regional and geographic economic development challenges," the
budget reads.

The Northern Border Regional Commission --- which covers parts of New
York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine --- helps fund rural child care,
workforce housing and small-town transit.

The Delta Regional Authority, which serves eight Southern states and
supports over 10 million residents, is also on the chopping block,
despite being recently reauthorized through 2029 and administering
transportation, broadband and flood recovery programs.

The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border
Regional Commission, and the Great Lakes Authority are also slated for
elimination.

[Congress could try to save the commissions]{.underline}. [During
Trump's first term]{.underline}, he proposed eliminating several of the
commissions but [Congress kept them funded]{.underline}.

B[ut DOGE did not yet exist, and the Trump administration's approach was
far less aggressive.]{.underline}

### 2ac -- renewable integration fails

#### Renewable integration causes diesel microgrid failure

Degradation of Diesel-Fired Generators

[A minimum optimal loading ratio]{.underline} (which is the actual load
as a percentage of the diesel generator's rated capacity[) of 20%--30%
is usually recommended by the manufacturer to minimize wear and tear on
the equipment]{.underline} (Mueller-Stoffels 2014). [When adding
renewables to a diesel microgrid, the power plant must manage a wider
variation of loads.]{.underline} Additionally, [the average demand for
diesel generation is reduced and less predictable, but the peak load
remains the same]{.underline}. [This can result in running diesel
generators at lower capacity factors and below the recommended minimum
load ratio]{.underline} to ensure there is adequate spinning reserve to
meet load fluctuations as well as potential interruptions in renewable
generation. [If the diesel generators are run excessively at load levels
below the recommended ratio]{.underline}, in addition to lower fuel
efficiency levels, a [condition called wet stacking can occur from
incomplete fuel combustion, resulting in a loss of lubrication that can
eventually **result in catastrophic failures**]{.underline}
(Mueller-Stoffels 2014).

### 1ar -- renewable integration fails

#### Renewables reduce the [heat]{.underline} diesel produces, which increases the risk of coolant leaks, freezing generators, and prevents using recovered heat for water treatment plants

Rebecca **Meadows,** 20**25** -- National Renewable Energy Lab
"Renewable Energy Integration in Remote Alaska Communities" January
<https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/90685.pdf> //DH

Loss of Power Plant Heat and Heat Recovery

Like the engine in a car, diesel engines in power plants require
cooling. This is accomplished by circulating a glycol-water mixture
through the engine cooling jacket, then to a remote radiator, where the
heat is dissipated to the outside air (Figure 3). The load on the
generator directly correlates to the amount of heat the engine
generates. Before reaching the radiator, the coolant is generally
diverted through a heat exchanger where it warms up the power plant's
hydronic heating loop. If enough heat is available, the generator
coolant can also warm an exterior heat recovery loop, which can
supplement the heating loads at nearby buildings. [As renewables are
brought online, the generators carry less load, and at times they can
even turn off, resulting in reduced available heat for the power
plant]{.underline} and adjacent facilities. The following potential
issues can result:

• Reduced temperature in the generator coolant loops: [The heat
recovered from the generator coolant is generally the only source of
space heat in rural Alaska power plants. Without it, the plant can get
cold and even freeze.]{.underline} Further, [if coolant temperatures are
low enough, it can cause seals to contract and leak. Cold coolant can
also prevent the timely dispatch of diesel generators because they need
time to warm up, especially from a cold start]{.underline}.

• Reduced output for heat recovery: [For many buildings]{.underline},
[particularly water treatment plants, recovered heat from the power
plant is a critical byproduct of electrical generation. Not only does it
reduce heating oil fuel consumption by supplementing a building's
primary heating system, but it also provides a critical redundancy that
can prevent a catastrophic freeze if the primary heating system
fails]{.underline}.

#### Renewables increase spinning reserve requirements, risking diesel grid collapse

Rebecca **Meadows,** 20**25** -- National Renewable Energy Lab
"Renewable Energy Integration in Remote Alaska Communities" January
<https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/90685.pdf> //DH

Increased Spinning Reserve Requirements

[Spinning reserve refers to the surplus generating capacity kept
online]{.underline} and primed [to respond to a sudden increase in
electric load]{.underline}. [This surplus in diesel-only microgrids is
achieved by running diesel generators at less than full
capacity]{.underline}, ensuring an excess that can be accessed to avoid
power outages and meet unmanaged loads. [The ability of diesel
generators to quickly adjust output makes them ideal for providing
spinning reserves, stabilizing the grid,]{.underline} and ensuring
consistent power quality amidst fluctuations in demand or supply.

[When intermittent renewables are included in the power system,
additional spinning reserve is required to account for sudden decreases
in renewable power]{.underline}. [A lack of readily deployable
generation assets to accommodate load fluctuations can result in lower
power quality, damage to electrical equipment, and power
outages]{.underline}.

To illustrate this point, imagine a power plant has 300- and
600-kilowatt (kW) diesel generators, an instantaneous load of 300 kW,
and a 20% spinning reserve requirement to accommodate any load
fluctuations. This would require having at least 360 kW of capacity
online and running the 600-kW generator at approximately 50% load (300
kW). If the plant receives 100 kW of wind power, it needs to meet the
remaining load (200 kW) plus 20% spinning reserve, as well as keep
enough additional capacity online to cover the wind generation if it
goes offline. If the plant switches to the 300-kW generator, it could
meet the instantaneous load but would not be able to cover the 100 kW of
wind power if it goes offline. In this case, the plant needs to continue
to run the 600-kW generator, albeit at a lower load, which results in
lower fuel efficiency. The peak load does not change, but the average
output is now lower---and also less predictable and more variable

### 2ac -- cost blocks renewables

#### Greater renewable energy isn't feasible for Alaska -- cost overwhelms

[One of the largest challenges remote communities still face is economy
of scale.]{.underline}

"For example, [a wind project in a remote community that uses one or two
100 kilowatt turbines is going to be much more expensive]{.underline}
[than a project in the Midwest that uses hundreds of 2 megawatts
turbines]{.underline}," Rose says. "In addition to the scale issue,
[logistical costs to develop renewable energy in remote rural
communities are typically much higher]{.underline} than costs along the
Railbelt. [Most materials must be barged in \[as is fuel\], and the cost
of mobilizing a crane for a wind turbine installation in a remote
community can be very substantia]{.underline}l."

Additionally, [upkeep costs can be detrimental to the feasibility of
projects due to remote, harsh conditions.]{.underline}

Thayer points out that [remote communities are also less likely to have
the trained workforce needed to maintain the systems]{.underline}.
Bringing in trained workers from other parts of the state or from the
Outside is very expensive and can lead to significant delays.

"[It is not uncommon for damaged installations to go for months before
skilled technicians can get out to them]{.underline}," Whitney says.

Like some of these rural communities, many of the state's renewable
energy resources are stranded.

"If a renewable energy resource is not located near a community or other
'load,' today it must at least be located near an existing transmission
line in order to be economically utilized," Rose says. "This means that
Alaska has a huge amount of renewable energy resources that are
effectively stranded. This is similar to North Slope natural gas that is
stranded because there is not a gas pipeline or other facility to get
the gas to market."

### 2ac - Alaska CP

#### [Federal lands deficit]{.underline} -- relocation requires the federal government to cede land

The second area for action concerns land for a new site. [Not all
communities have land on which to relocate, and many may seek
**federally owned land**]{.underline} (which constitutes 61.3 per cent
of all land ownership in Alaska146). As mentioned above, ANSCA and
subsequent legislation (the Alaska National Interests Lands Conservation
Act or ANILCA) already provide for uneven land trades, though such
trades may depend on the attitudes of people currently staffing the
federal agencies. [To fulfil climate-justice obligations and acknowledge
the constraints that ANSCA has imposed on adaptive capacity, the federal
government should simply *give* land to ANVs]{.underline} in certain
situations.147 [The Alaska Congressional delegation should seek to amend
ANILCA to enable the transfer]{.underline} a certain acreage of
[land]{.underline} (dependent on ANV population) [to any ANV that has a
written plan to relocate and is willing to survey and build on the new
site within five years]{.underline}. Parcels of land that are especially
environmentally sensitive (such as lands designated by the us Congress
as Wilderness148) could be exempt. The amendment could specify
allocation of this land between the ANV and any associated municipal
entity or village corporation. [The amendment could]{.underline} also
[provide ANVs with the option to immediately place the transferred land
into trust to avoid the potential of alienation of 'fee simple'
land]{.underline}.149 [Trust status would give ANVs the jurisdiction

#### [Funding deficit]{.underline} -- Alaska lacks the capacity to fund

Jason **Iverson**, 20**13** -- law student, Seattle University School of
Law. \"Funding Alaska Village Relocation Caused by Climate Change and
Preserving Cultural Values During Relocation,\" Seattle Journal for
Social Justice: Vol. 12: Iss. 2, Article 12. Available at:
https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/sjsj/vol12/iss2/12 //DH

[Alaska native village relocation will cost hundreds of millions of
dollars.]{.underline} [A comprehensive financial plan to effect
relocation needs to be federally implemented in order for relocations to
be carried out successfully.]{.underline}19 Currently, there is no
federal entity that is responsible for village relocation. This must
change as the federal government has an obligation to finance village
relocation due to its historical relationship with Alaska natives.

[The federal government was responsible for the location selections of
most current Alaska native villages, originally treating Alaska natives
as wards]{.underline} of the federal government. While this wardship of
native peoples and lands was essentially eliminated through the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act,20 the federal government still has a duty
to maintain the well-being of indigenous peoples in the midst of
unprecedented, climate-induced forced emigration because [the federal
government itself is mostly responsible for the location of native
villages and prior disenfranchisement of native peoples]{.underline}.
[State and local agencies are ill-equipped to handle this social and
economic crisis]{.underline}. It must fall on the shoulders of the
federal government because it constitutes a natural disaster, which
federal agencies are mandated to alleviate.21

The Army Corps of Engineers is currently permitted to assist villages in
combating climate effects, but the fixes provided by the Corps are
merely band-aids that will in no way ensure the survival of coastal
Alaska villages. These band-aid fixes to crumbling infrastructure and
eroding village borders are just prolonging the inevitable consequences:
many villages in coastal Alaska will soon be underwater or otherwise
uninhabitable. Without a proper plan in place for relocation, villagers
have little chance to relocate their community while preserving
community values.

Recently, a Ninth Court Circuit opinion, Kivalina v. ExxonMobil
Corporation, reiterated the struggles that Alaska native villages face
in finding suitable relocation sites.22 The opinion explicitly discusses
how villages are plagued by erosion, flooding, and melting permafrost as
a result of global warming.23

In Kivalina, the Alaska native village of Kivalina brought suit against
Exxon Mobile and other emission-producing companies on the theory of
public nuisance (the nuisance: emissions of greenhouse gases that have
contributed to the deterioration of the village).24 Kivalina also argued
that there was a conspiracy among Exxon and other similarly situated
companies to continue their practice of emitting greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere even though these companies know of the potential ill
effects that those emissions have on the environment, the atmosphere,
and the general environment.25

The court of appeals in this case recognized that Kivalina had suffered
an injury in the form of village degradation, but found that no standing
could be established for Kivalina because the causal chain to the injury
was too tenuous.26 In other words, it was not possible to find that
Exxon's and other companies' practices were responsible for the
environmental degradation of the village of Kivalina. Furthermore, the
court found that the issue of awarding damages for injuries caused by
greenhouse gas emissions was a non-justiciable political question.27
Consequently, the suit was dismissed, and Kivalina did not receive money
from private oil companies to move its village to a safer physical
location.28

Kivalina and other similarly situated villages remain in dire need of
federal assistance. Village relocation planning provides the best way to
ensure the continuity of their communities and native cultures. To
preserve native cultural values, avoid human suffering, and to mitigate
financial cost, [the federal government must collaborate with tribal and
Alaska state agencies to effectuate and pay for native village
relocations.]{.underline} Waiting to disperse federal funds until after
the villages are declared disaster areas, or not allowing native
villages to receive federal funds because of their inability to comply
with aid requirements would be unjust and inequitable to Alaska's rural,
native population. Moreover, dispersing the local population of affected
villages could result in unwanted assimilation into other cultures and a
loss of traditional culture and language.29

To best implement a plan of village relocation in Alaska, FEMA and HUD
should either exempt villages from meeting the strict agency financial
assistance requirements or expand existing federal programs to include
native villages and pay for village relocation.30 Allowing villages to
qualify for FEMA's disaster mitigation programs and HUD's Community
Block Grant Program are attractive options, as either would allow for a
declaration for disaster relief, thereby letting the government pay for
most of the relocation while relying minimally on state or
village-appropriated funds.31 These initiatives would also allow for
villages to completely move to new sites in an effort to avoid
disadvantageous cultural effects that would result from consolidating
village populations or urbanizing traditionally rural populations.32

[While state and private agencies have been active in attempting to find
a way to relocate]{.underline} small and remote [Alaska native
villages]{.underline} affected by global warming, [the issue again turns
to funding]{.underline}.33 Who exactly could pay for the relocations?
The individual townships and village corporations generally cannot
afford such relocations because they lack community funds and knowhow.34
The financial burden has thus been placed on state agencies and ad hoc
commission groups formed with the support of native leadership instead
of rightly imposing on departments within the federal government that
have the skill, resources, and finances needed to move populations of
people subjected to natural disasters.

The Army Corps of Engineers estimates [it will cost]{.underline} about
\$95-\$[125 million to relocate one village of]{.underline} 300 to [400
people]{.underline}.35 Other than providing a small amount of federal
stimulus money to village relocation, the federal government has been
absent from organizing a plan to help many Alaska villages relocate.36
Despite the ongoing destruction of these villages through severe
environmental damage,37 [funding from the federal government has been
unavailable because Alaska native villages do not qualify for natural
disaster relief]{.underline}.38 HUD and FEMA have not recognized the
villages as official "organized towns" that qualify for aid.39 Although
the situation for Alaska villages is dire (ravaged by flooding, melting
permafrost, and erosion), FEMA currently has no plan(s) in place to fund
village relocation or declare such villages as natural disaster sites.40

#### Perm do both -- it creates more sustainable funding

#### Sales tax won't generate enough revenue and harms Alaska's economy

Research Center and vice president of policy at The Buckeye Institute.

//DH

In 2016, [the Alaska legislature proposed]{.underline} introducing [a
new three percent sales tax]{.underline} with exemptions on a variety of
goods and services.29 As a type of consumption tax, sales taxes are less
distortionary than more disruptive taxes on labor or capital income. The
proposed sales tax, however, would still be expected to reduce Alaska's
economic output and lower expected job creation relative to a baseline
of a balanced budget.

[A static estimate using Alaska's fiscal notes predicted that the
proposed sales tax would generate]{.underline} approximately [\$244
million]{.underline} in state revenue[. Static estimates]{.underline},
however, [do not account for how the new tax will influence]{.underline}
the [behavio]{.underline}r of workers, families, and businesses, [which
will]{.underline} in turn [affect]{.underline} the [estimated
revenues.]{.underline}

By contrast, as shown in Table 1 on the following page, [the ERC's
dynamic model accounts for behavioral changes and estimates that under
the proposed new sales tax Alaska will see 1,700 fewer jobs
created]{.underline} in the first year, trending toward 1,900 fewer jobs
created within three years. The more reliable dynamic model also
estimates that [the proposed sales tax will only generate approximately
\$200 million in state revenue]{.underline}, or 18 percent less than the
static estimate.

With respect to local communities, an income tax would be fairer than a
sales tax would be, particularly when it comes to rural Alaska. [More
than 100 local jurisdictions in]{.underline}

[the state rely heavily on local sales taxes]{.underline}, most of them
small (the two largest cities do not have a sales tax).58 [Rural Alaska
pays significantly more for basics like groceries and fuel than urban
Alaska]{.underline}59, [and a state sales tax could significantly reduce
both spending and local revenues for communities when combined with a
local sales tax]{.underline}. On the other hand, a state income tax
would reduce the amount of money people have to spend in the economy.
Because the reduction in household income would be so much smaller for
lowincome (often rural60) families, however, the impact to smaller,
rural communities would still likely be smaller with an income tax than
a sales tax.

#### New budget pressure means Alaska cuts funds to the Permanent Fund Dividend -- that's worse for rural Alaska

Down the Crisis" 5/9

//DH

[Alaska is staring down a deepening budget gap]{.underline}. For fiscal
year 2025, [the state is looking at a \$200 million deficit. By 2026,
that hole could balloon past \$1.5 billion]{.underline}. While oil
revenue bumps and federal aid have created short-term relief, the
long-term problems haven't gone away. Underneath the surface lies a
structural imbalance --- one that's been ignored for too long. So what's
really driving this crisis? What are the common misconceptions? And what
happens if nothing changes?

Main Causes Behind the Budget Deficit

Alaska's budget issues aren't just a matter of bad luck. They stem from
long-term dependencies and spending patterns that no longer match the
economic reality. Let's unpack the two biggest culprits.

Dependence on Oil Revenue

Oil remains Alaska's financial backbone. Roughly 40% of the state's
entire budget depends on oil income. The problem? It's unpredictable.
For every \$1 drop in oil prices, the state loses an estimated \$35--40
million. That's a massive hit for a single dollar shift. With global
markets fluctuating and fossil fuel demand evolving, basing the budget
on oil is like betting your paycheck on the stock market.

Rising Costs of Social Programs

[Healthcare, education, and welfare aren't getting cheaper. Alaska has
seen costs for Medicaid and other public services rise sharply, while
federal contributions shrink]{.underline}. When federal funding for
programs like Medicaid dips, the state has to make up the difference.
That's pushed spending higher without a corresponding increase in
revenue. [The result? A widening gap between what the government wants
to fund --- and what it can actually afford]{.underline}.

Popular Myths About the Deficit

Budget crises always come with oversimplified solutions. In Alaska's
case, a few myths keep popping up --- but they don't hold up under
scrutiny.

Myth 1: Just Cut the Dividends

[Some argue that cutting the Permanent Fund Dividend]{.underline} (PFD)
[would fix everything]{.underline}. Sure, it might shave off a portion
of the deficit, but it's a temporary patch. More importantly, [dividends
are a vital source of income for many Alaskans ---
especially]{.underline} those **[in rural communities]{.underline}**.
[Reducing]{.underline} or eliminating **[them would hit those residents
the hardest]{.underline}**, without addressing the core issue: a budget
model built on volatile income.

Myth 2: Raise Taxes and the Problem Disappears

Sounds simple --- just tax more. But Alaska is one of the few states
without a personal income or statewide sales tax. Introducing new taxes
would be a political minefield, and any such move would face serious
opposition. There's also the risk of slowing down economic activity or
driving residents and businesses out of the state. In short: taxes might
be part of the solution, but they're not a silver bullet.

The Real-World Impact of Budget Shortfalls

So what happens [when a state runs out of money?]{.underline} It's not
just numbers on a spreadsheet --- [people feel it in their daily
lives.]{.underline}

Education gets hit first. Schools are already facing budget tightening.
Larger class sizes, fewer programs, and strained resources are becoming
the norm.

[Healthcare access declines, especially in rural areas. Budget cuts can
lead to closures of clinics and hospitals]{.underline}, forcing
residents to travel further for basic care --- or go without.

Savings get drained. Alaska continues dipping into its reserve funds to
fill the gap. That's like covering rent with your emergency savings ---
it works for a while, but eventually, you run dry.

These consequences don't just affect the poor or unemployed. They ripple
across the entire state, touching everyone from teachers to small
business owners.

Some have proposed raising taxes to cover current budget shortfalls. But
[new taxes come with new burdens]{.underline}, for both the taxpayer and
the state, [including significant administrative costs associated with
standing up new bureaucracies]{.underline}. Perhaps Alaska will need to
raise taxes someday, but not today. [Alaska lacks the proper tax base of
businesses and wage earners to sustain higher taxes. The state's economy
is too unstable, its budget too erratic, and its business environment
too unpredictable]{.underline} [for job creators to]{.underline}
seriously consider Alaska and [provide the tax base needed]{.underline}
for responsible tax increases. Until that changes, policymakers must
find another path to a prudent budget and sound economy.

First, a [community wishing to relocate needs somewhere to
go.]{.underline} According to ANCSA § 22(f), the Secretaries of
Interior, Defense, Agriculture, or the State of Alaska can exchange
lands with the corporations organized by Native Groups, Village
Corporations, Regional Corporations, and other municipalities to affect
land consolidations or to facilitate the management of land or
development of land, or for other public purposes.309 [Federal lands
constitute 61.3 percent of land ownership in Alaska]{.underline};310
[therefore, the federal government has the authority to execute land
exchanges]{.underline}.311 [ANCSA]{.underline} § 17(d)(1) also [allows
the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw federal public lands for
review and to determine "which lands should be included in the
conservation system]{.underline}, which lands should be made available
for use under the public lands laws, [and which lands should be made
available to the State and Alaska Natives for land
selections]{.underline}."312 Although these withdrawals were intended to
be temporary, many of them are still under the control of the federal
government.313

#### Federal restrictions on new construction limit relocation

In addition to the challenges of not having a lead agency or a
streamlined process for site selection, relocation, and the associated
environmental reviews, [ANVs seeking government assistance for
relocation must grapple with federal]{.underline} and state
[restrictions on building in floodplains and wetlands]{.underline}.62
[These restrictions,]{.underline} which [require government-sponsored
construction projects to be sited and constructed to]{.underline}
[reduce the potential for flood and erosion damage,]{.underline} are
important to limit new construction in flood-prone areas. But
[they]{.underline} can also [complicate the expansion or relocation of
ANVs already located in flood- plains (**as so many are**]{.underline}).
[An ANV may have trouble receiving funding for needed
repairs]{.underline} at its existing site [because of its floodplain
location]{.underline}, in addition to the troubles of securing funding
for infrastructure at a new site.63

Newtok\'s decision to relocate, along with the imminent threat of
flooding and erosion, impeded its ability to get funding needed to keep
the community\'s facilities running in the interim.64 Also, Newtok was
not able to secure infrastructure at its relocation site, Mertarvik,
until one agency (the us Economic Development Administration) decided to
invest in construction of a dock necessary for bringing in equipment and
supplies by barge.65 At the same time, there is concern that investment
made to preserve existing communities in their current location could
delay their relocation.66

### 1ar -- funding deficit

#### The permutation solves best -- Alaska alone lacks funding, data and the ability to coordinate

//DH

One of the challenges facing at-risk communities is the lack of a formal
federal or State policy on climate change response, especially as it
relates to relocation. An interagency approach will be necessary to
obtain funding for and implement strategies to coordinate and assist
with planning. It is important to recognize that [although the State has
a role in responding to the effects of climate change, much of the
responsibility remains with federal authorities.]{.underline} [There is
no consistent or overarching federal policy related to the issue; this
hinders action in the short term and leads to uncertainty in the long
term. The State's role can be augmented with more effective federal
policy in place]{.underline}.

[The effectiveness of adaptation responses depends on accurate
information from both western science and Indigenous
Knowledge]{.underline}. Using both knowledge systems produces
science-informed, culturally relevant, place-based solutions. [Some of
the data necessary for adaptation action does exist]{.underline}, and a
various organizations can provide a large variety of Alaska and Arctic
research data. However, [there remain significant data gaps in much of
the Interior and Western Alaska,]{.underline} as well as along the
Western coast. Building local capacity is essential for comprehensive
climate change response and adaptation. While this is an essential
service in many respects, it is also a growth opportunity for the state.
Developing the expertise and skillset necessary to respond to the
effects of climate change will benefit the future of all Alaskans, and
is exportable knowledge as well.

Action 1.3A: Create a policy framework for federal and State agencies'
implementation to assist with communities' relocation and adaptation
actions.

• The State should develop a strategic plan that implements this
process; it should include support for DCRA's community risk planning
and the recommendations of the interagency working groups for threatened
communities.

• The State should assist communities in advocating for increased
federal funding to address this issue. Implementation should be
consistent with community-defined priorities and decisions.

Action 1.3B: Collaborate with federal agencies to develop a federal
implementation plan, with associated funding in place for threatened and
at-risk communities, responsive to local and regional planning.

• [The State should]{.underline} advocate for and [request the Alaska
congressional delegation to secure federal funding for new and existing
programs that address and prevent damage resulting from permafrost
degradation]{.underline}, loss of sea ice, and coastal [and riverine
erosion]{.underline}.

• The State should recommend changes to federal programs under the broad
authority provided in US Code Title 25 (also known as the Snyder Act of
1924), which covers Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office
of Trust Services; and the Tribal Resilience Program, which was created
and received appropriations for a Tribal Climate Resiliency Grant
Program.

• The State should explore opportunities to enhance the Stafford Act,
expanding the definition of "major disaster" in 42 U.S.C. § 5122(2) to
include damage resulting from permafrost degradation, loss of sea ice,
increased storminess, and coastal and riverine erosion. Changes to the
Stafford Act will have national implications and may not result in
direct action beneficial to Alaska communities.

• [The State should work with the Denali Commission to develop an action
plan for threatened and at-risk communities that includes adaptation and
relocation strategies]{.underline}.

• The State should share planning tools such as the U.S. Climate
Resilience Toolkit and the U.S. Climate Alliance Toolkit. The State
should downscale this approach and develop a model Alaska toolkit that
helps to share Alaska's story and exports Alaska knowledge.

### 1ar -- funding tradeoff

#### New spending priorities will force budget cuts to other programs -- Alaska is already in a deficit

Eric **Stone**, 20**25** - is Alaska Public Media's state government
reporter "State lawmakers face tough budget choices as faltering oil
revenue turns a surplus into a deficit" Alaska Public Media, 2/6,
<https://alaskapublic.org/news/politics/alaska-legislature/2025-02-06/state-lawmakers-face-tough-budget-choices-as-faltering-oil-revenue-turns-a-surplus-into-a-deficit>
//DH

[State lawmakers have tough choices ahead as they look to balance the
budget while also pursuing]{.underline} the [priorities]{.underline} of
the House and Senate's Democrat-dominated majority caucuses.

That's according to legislative budget analysts, who recently told House
and Senate budget writers that the same old, same old won't cut it this
year.

Back in December, Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed his version of the budget.
It came with a full, statutory Permanent Fund dividend of about \$3,800
per Alaskan. It also came with a \$1.5 billion deficit --- which, as it
happens, is about half of the balance in the state's primary savings
account.

Dunleavy's budget director, Lacey Sanders, told the Senate Finance
Committee last month that the governor doesn't see much choice but to
propose mega-dividends, given that the formula remains in state law. But
even Sanders said the billion-and-a-half-dollar deficit isn't ideal.

\"The fiscal picture is not looking great when you are depleting over
half of it in one year,\" she said.

Senate Finance Committee co-chair Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka,
characteristically, put it a bit more bluntly.

\"In private enterprise, it would be called a company-ending event,\" he
said. \"In government, it\'s called, I don\'t know, stupidity.\"

Lawmakers haven't followed the PFD formula for nearly a decade. Since
oil prices dipped in the mid-2010s, and a court case in 2017, the
Legislature has set the PFD on a basically ad-hoc basis --- whatever the
state can afford that year.

For the last two years, though, lawmakers have settled on something of
an informal formula for setting the PFD amount: 25% of the state's
annual drawdown from the Permanent Fund goes to dividends, with the
other 75% going to regular state services like state troopers, roads and
public schools.

This year, using that same 75-25 formula would leave the state with a
\$30 million surplus --- basically balanced, but right on the edge.
However, that's before counting some baseline priorities for the
Legislature.

After adding in status quo education funding to keep up with one-time
funding last year, plus some expected increases in Medicaid expenses and
labor contracts, Legislative Finance Division Director Alexei Painter
said [lawmakers are facing a \$197 million deficit]{.underline} in the
coming fiscal year\'s budget.

\"[You\'re going to have to either find other budget reductions, reduce
the dividend further, or explore new revenue options]{.underline},\"
Painter told the House Finance Committee last month. \"You can\'t just
do that one thing and it\'s solved, which has worked kind of the last
two years.\"

To be clear --- this is not the situation lawmakers thought they would
find themselves in when they left town last year. Legislative leaders
said they had balanced the budget, and even left a small surplus.

#### Alaska is already going to face massive future budget pressure from federal Medicaid cuts. If it cuts in response due to budget pressure, it will devastate Native health care

Rachel **Cassandra and** Liz **Ruskin**, 20**25** - Alaska Public Media
"How major cuts to Medicaid could be 'catastrophic,' even for Alaskans
with private insurance" 3/11,

<https://alaskapublic.org/news/health/2025-03-11/how-major-cuts-to-medicaid-could-be-catastrophic-even-for-alaskans-with-private-insurance>
//DH

[Congress is contemplating huge cuts to Medicaid]{.underline}, the
government-funded health insurance program [that covers]{.underline}
nearly **[40% of Alaskans]{.underline}**. If federal funding is
substantially reduced, many Alaskans could lose their insurance and the
strain would be felt throughout the health care system, potentially
[reducing services and raising costs]{.underline} for Alaskans with
other types of insurance, too.

What is Medicaid?

It's an insurance program for low-income Americans and those with
disabilities. The costs are split between the federal government and the
state, 50-50 for the regular medicaid program. A few programs, like for
pregnant women, have a higher federal match.

As part of the Affordable Care Act, Congress expanded Medicaid to serve
people whose income is slightly higher. Alaska adopted the program in
2015. Medicaid expansion now covers 76,000 Alaskans. It has the highest
federal match of all Medicaid programs in the state at 90%.

The Childrens' Health Insurance Program, CHIP, is Medicaid for kids, and
in Alaska it's called Denali KidCare.

How many Alaskans have health insurance through Medicaid?

About 38% of Alaskans, 279,000 people, were on Medicaid in 2024,
according to the state's Department of Health. That includes 57% of
Alaska children, 35% of Alaska adults and 15% of Alaska seniors.

Alaska is heavily dependent on the program. Last year, only New Mexico
had a greater percentage of its population on Medicaid, and Alaska was a
close second.

More than 1 in 3 births in Alaska were covered by Medicaid in 2024,
according to the state vital statistics report. That's partly because of
increased eligibility for pregnant and postpartum women.

Most beneficiaries (64%) live in Anchorage, the Mat-Su Borough and in
the Interior combined. 36% live outside of those most-populated areas.

How much money does Medicaid in Alaska cost the federal government?

Medicaid spending is a substantial pillar of Alaska's health care
funding. Total spending was \$2.7 billion for health care services in
Alaska last year, and the state paid just 24% of that, or \$634 million.
Medicaid costs in the state are also projected to increase over the next
two decades.

Jared Kosin, president and CEO of the Alaska Hospital & Healthcare
Association, said if Congress makes substantial cuts to Medicaid, the
impact on people who use Medicaid in Alaska, as well as the hospitals
and providers that serve them, would be enormous.

["It would be catastrophic]{.underline}, not only for the health care
system, \[but\] [for Alaskans across our entire state]{.underline},"
Kosin said recently on KFSK in Petersburg.

Almost [every corner of the health care system in the state relies
heavily on Medicaid. That includes]{.underline} hospitals, clinics and
private practice offices, and the **[tribal health care]{.underline}**
system.

If Medicaid is cut, what happens to the Alaska beneficiaries?

Depending on how the cuts are rolled out, [the state could disenroll
categories of people]{.underline}, leaving them without coverage. [Or
the state could make up the funding difference, but that would be an
**enormous hit to the state budget**]{.underline}, **[which is already
strained]{.underline}**. There is no simple way to cut the state's
Medicaid budget without increasing health care costs for the state down
the line.

One way to cut the funding that's been floated is that the expansion
program could change from a 90% federal match to a 50% match, the same
as regular Medicaid.

Kosin said just that one cut would cost the state millions.

"So if the Feds say, 'Hey, we\'re going to roll this back, and we\'re
going to only cover half of Medicaid expansion. You cover the rest,'
that means we\'d have to come up with \$330 million," Kosin said.

The latest numbers show the expansion program covers 76,000 Alaskans,
over a quarter of the Medicaid population in the state. The expansion
population includes a wider swath of Alaskans, including single people
and those with incomes slightly above cutoffs for regular Medicaid.
Since Alaska introduced the program in 2015, the state has seen unpaid
hospital bills decline by almost half.

With major federal cuts, the expansion population could lose coverage
entirely. But Kosin said leaving more Alaskans uninsured would be more
costly long term. Kosin said all Alaskans would feel the result of those
uninsured residents. Wealthier Alaskans may still have a choice of care,
but for the uninsured who can't afford to pay out-of-pocket, their only
choice will be ER care.

"Hospital emergency rooms will always serve you," Kosin said. "We\'re
required by law to do so."

He said the ER is the most expensive place to receive medical care.
Average emergency room bills run in the thousands of dollars, compared
to hundreds of dollars for most urgent care or doctors' visits. And if
people can't afford to pay those bills, they just won't, driving up the
cost of care for all Alaskans, even those with private insurance.

What else might be cut?

The state could cut so-called "optional" Medicaid services, like dental
care, vision care or in-home care.

Monique Martin, vice president of intergovernmental affairs for the
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, said the services aren't really
optional and cutting them won't save the state money in the long run.

"Most 'optional services' are offered in lieu of a much more expensive
mandatory service," she said.

In-home care, for instance, allows more rural Alaskans to stay in their
home towns or villages, instead of having to move to urban areas for
live-in care.

Lawmakers have also talked about adding work requirements to Medicaid,
which would be a default way to force some people out of the program.
But if people aren't well enough to work and they can't get health care
to get well, it could keep them out of the workforce indefinitely, or,
again, keep them from getting care until it's an emergency.

"If we want people to be productive, we should provide health coverage,"
said Valerie Davidson, a former state health commissioner who championed
Medicaid expansion under former Gov. Bill Walker. "Because if people
can\'t work, they can\'t hunt, they can\'t fish, and they can\'t learn
if they\'re not healthy enough to do so. Being healthy is a prerequisite
to being able to be productive."

The Trump administration has also discussed incentivizing states to
switch to using "block grants" as a way to cap Medicaid spending by
state. Davidson said that won't work well for Alaska because the state
doesn't have a robust and well-established health care infrastructure.
And she said rationing care through block grants would cause all the
same issues as the other possible cuts, making health care more
expensive for all Alaskans in the long term.

Why is Congress considering cutting the program, and what exactly would
lawmakers cut?

The U.S. House passed a budget blueprint that calls for cutting a lot of
money --- \$880 billion --- from a section of the budget that includes
Medicaid. Budget experts say there's no way to slice that much out of
spending without cutting into Medicaid. But we don't know exactly where
the cuts will come from.

It's worth noting that President Trump and other Republicans have said
they won't cut Medicaid, but that seems to conflict with the
House-passed budget resolution.

Is it true that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut Medicaid so
that wealthier people can get a tax break?

That's one way to frame it. The Republicans are trying to enact many of
President Trump's priorities. Among them is the continuation of the 2017
tax cuts, which are about to expire. Extending them increases the
deficit by \$4.5 trillion. Republicans are looking to make cuts
elsewhere to partially offset the cost. The House budget, as written,
would still increase the deficit by about \$2.5 trillion.

How might major Medicaid cuts impact the whole health care system in
Alaska?

The entire health care system in Alaska is dependent on Medicaid
funding. For Providence Alaska, it's 25% of the revenue. At Anchorage
Neighborhood Health Clinic, it's 34%, and [the Alaska Native Tribal
Health Consortium gets about 40% of its income from
Medicaid.]{.underline}

Medicaid is hugely important for the tribal health care system.

The Indian Health Service provides less than 15% of ANTHC's funding,
Monique Martin said. Medicaid and Medicare together provide about 70% of
payments.

So, in the long term, while experts say big Medicaid cuts likely
wouldn't shut down tribal health care, it would be a huge financial
blow.

And [if hospitals with emergency rooms have to treat a lot more
uninsured patients, they]{.underline} also [may not]{.underline} be able
to [survive.]{.underline}

### AT: Alaska budget surplus

#### The official surplus is tiny, and relies on overly optimistic projections of high oil prices

James **Brooks and** Corinne **Smith**, 20**25** -- Alaska Beacon "Amid
bleak state revenue forecast, Alaska Gov. Dunleavy vetoes millions in
education funding" 6/12,

<https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/06/12/amid-bleak-state-revenue-forecast-alaska-gov-dunleavy-vetoes-millions-in-education-funding/>
//DH

Gov. Mike [Dunleavy vetoed]{.underline} more than [\$122 million from
Alaska's annual budget plan]{.underline} before signing it into law
Thursday.

The governor's vetoes fell heaviest [on education]{.underline}, as
Dunleavy eliminated more than \$50 million from the state's per-student
education funding formula and tens of millions intended for major school
maintenance projects.

Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce
Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said lawmakers are not likely to consider a veto
override vote until January at the earliest, a schedule that will leave
school districts with months of uncertainty.

"Statewide, districts will instantly need to find the equivalent of
\$200 per student to cut from their budgets. It remains to be seen what
will happen as a result of this action from the governor, but certainly,
emergency school closures are on the table for districts," said Jharrett
Bryantt, superintendent of the Anchorage School District, during a
special school board meeting Thursday evening.

"If you haven't captured it already, this is an education emergency," he
said.

It is the first time in state history that a governor has failed to
fully fund the education formula, a precedent-breaking act akin to
former Gov. Bill Walker's decision in 2016 to veto part of the Permanent
Fund dividend, which until then had been decided by a previously
sacrosanct formula.

The governor announced his decision without comment; he did not hold a
news conference, as is traditional, and his office said they would not
be able to respond to a list of emailed questions until Friday.

The governor's vetoes did not significantly change the size of the
budget, and the amount of his vetoes was down from prior years.

"I wish there would have been more cuts, more vetoes, so that we could
have a better budget. But that's not what happened," said Rep. Jamie
Allard, R-Eagle River and a member of the House Finance Committee.

She said she suggested the governor veto additional grants to
nonprofits.

Oil prices drove vetoes, Dunleavy says

In a prerecorded video released earlier Thursday, the governor said his
vetoes were the result of depressed oil prices.

"The oil situation has deteriorated. The price of oil has gone down.
Therefore our revenue is going down. Basically, we don't have enough
money to pay for all of our obligations. So as a result of that, you're
going to see some reductions in this year's budget. It's not an easy
thing to do. It's certainly not a fun thing to do, but it's necessary,"
he said.

Unusually, the governor's vetoes appeared to be driven by a revenue
forecast that wasn't made available to lawmakers when they were crafting
their draft budget.

[Legislators typically rely on a spring forecast published by the Alaska
Department of Revenue]{.underline}, and based on that forecast, the
budget submitted by legislators to the governor --- spread across three
separate budget bills --- had a surplus of about \$56.5 million.

[After the governor's vetoes, the state budget now has a surplus of
a]{.underline}bout [\$186 million]{.underline}, according to figures
published by the Office of Management and Budget.

[But that estimated surplus is based upon the spring
forecast]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} on Thursday, [the Department of
Revenue released a new estimate saying that projected oil revenue is
**down by \$222 million from that prior forecast.**]{.underline}

[The federal government must]{.underline} also [eliminate the need for
Alaska villages to comply with]{.underline} the [NEPA]{.underline}
requirement. First, [NEPA's requirement that environmental impact
statements be produced by a federal agency would be difficult because

regulations when they prohibited military projects in "emergency
situations."228 Agencies such as FEMA and HUD also need to recognize
that disasters can manifest themselves in forms that have not been
traditionally acknowledged, such as melting ice, melting permafrost, and
large-scale erosion. [By not allowing Alaska villages to easily access

So, [the issue being framed]{.underline} in the report [is
that]{.underline} the [investments the governments make into threatened
communities must be sustainable]{.underline}. According to Luke (1999),
sustainability can serve a few roles in the governing process. Firstly,
it can act as a decision-making tool, prioritizing economic
sustainability over other concerns. And secondly, [sustainability can be
used as a tool of control over the development of the land]{.underline}.
It is important to consider how [sustainability and ecogovernmentality
serve to reinforce coloniality]{.underline} (Quijano, 2000; 2007) [by
encouraging state (or corporation) control and decision-making over
territory rather than Indigenous stewardship]{.underline}. As Luke
(1995) argues, ecogovernmentality operates to maintain territory, by
controlling the use of resources and development (pp. 68-69). However,
development is also a problematic concept, regardless of control. As
Mignolo (2023) highlights, [injustices are maintained in a colonial
system, where 'development' is promised to address the
injustices]{.underline}. [But development will not liberate Indigenous
communities where their right to self-determination is not recognized,
and their lands are occupied by settlers]{.underline}.

Rutherford (1999) argues that [one technique of ecogovernmentality is
the use of EIAs]{.underline} (p. 57), [which can add layers of
bureaucracy to a project]{.underline}, as pointed out by Newtok
community member Stanly Tom:

> The Department of Commerce and Economic Development will be doing a
> community profile mapping of the existing and the new relocation site,
> and I need both to be done as soon as possible, especially the new
> village site so we can start working on the environmental review
> record for the new village site, also known as the National
> Environment Policy Act. (Tom, 2004, p. 130)

[NEPA is a decision-making tool for the US government to assess whether
a development project fits within the goals and objectives of the
state]{.underline} (Rutherford, 1999, p. 57). As Rutherford (1999)
argues, [NEPA and other EIAs not only problematize development but
cements science into the government apparatus]{.underline} (pp. 58-59)
[which in turn legitimizes science and further isolates IK from
decision-making bodies. By constraining the use and validity of IK,
**EIAs uphold a colonial system**]{.underline} (Quijano, 2007).
Interestingly, even a governing body such as the Denali Commission which
views relocation as necessary, its work is still constrained by NEPA
regulations:

As required by NEPA, the no action alternative was carried forward for
analysis in the FEIS (Final Environmental Impact Statement). (Denali
Commission, 2018, p. 2)

Further frustration is expressed by communities that despite the high
cost of relocation, funding has been directed towards studies rather
than to the community:

> [We continue to have serious concerns that these funds would be
> required to go toward feasibility studies instead of
> construction]{.underline}... The situation facing Shishmaref needs to
> be categorized as an emergency, and overly burdensome Federal
> regulations must be eased. (Eningowuk, 2004, pp. 136-137)

[These extra regulations and bureaucracy reflect a state that maintains
itself using scientific and data collection in order to make informed
decisions. While the state has time to make careful decisions,
vulnerable peoples are left to deal with the active effects of climate
change]{.underline}.

#### Communities won't trust an Environmental Impact Statement because it's externally imposed

The fifth limitation is about [asymmetries in power, knowledge, and
control]{.underline} \[95,102,110,122\]. These asymmetries continue to
[marginalise communities in engagement processes dominated by top-down
models of governance]{.underline} \[95,111,124\]. Governments and
companies design and control engagement processes, which are criticised
for being too formal and too technical \[91,95\]. The definition of
"public consultation" in Greenland largely refers to one-way flow of
information sharing in a way proposed by project proponents \[127,128\].
As demonstrated by Teschner and Holley \[112\], [participants in the
Environmental Impact Statement for the Donlin Gold project in Western
Alaska "felt patronized by a bureaucratic process that focused on
fitting stakeholder concerns into technical and scientific disciplines
for analysis by outside experts]{.underline}". [Communities feel
powerless and distrust external processes where the final decision is
not in their hands]{.underline} \[129\]. [Government-]{.underline} or
corporate-[led meetings are not always perceived as neutral, inclusive,
equal, or deliberative]{.underline} \[117\]. In some cases, communities
refused to attend consultation meetings due to "company\'s abandonment
of protocol and disrespectful behaviour", as was reported in the case of
Gallok, Jokkmokk in Sweden \[107\]. Scobie and Rodgers \[122\] found
that during consultations about a mining project in northern Baffin
Island, communities reported "inability to express their concerns" due
to "insufficient education and inaccessible information" and "a general
discomfort with the atmosphere in meetings" which had "formal and
intimidating nature". They were concerned that "if they spoke up, it may
ruin job opportunities for youth" (p. 237).

Climate change, colonialism & maladaptation" Environmental Science &
Policy Volume 169, July 2025, Science Direct //DH

[Despite the critical role of adaptation planning, implementation has
been challenging]{.underline} (Shi, 2019[). Development pressures and
short-term political priorities routinely take precedence over good
planning and constrain adaptation]{.underline} (Birchall et al., 2022b,
Karki, 2017, Kehler and Birchall, 2023, Pløger, 2004). Status quo
approaches to decision-making, infrastructure and resource development
are insufficient to address climate change (Davoudi et al., 2013, Tyler
and Moench, 2012). Adaptations are frequently reactionary, and rely on
expensive gray infrastructure measures that, despite increasing risk,
serve to drive economic productivity and foster public complacency to
climate risk (Malik and Ford, 2024, Noblet and Brisson, 2017). In turn[,
adaptations are frequently maladaptive, **worsening vulnerability** and
trapping communities on chronically maladaptive paths]{.underline}
(Kehler and Birchall, 2023). Path dependencies result when past planning
decisions constrain decision-making now, reinforcing institutions and
maintaining historical status quo (Van Assche et al., 2018).

[Understanding planning history -- one often deeply rooted in
colonialism -- is]{.underline} therefore [a key aspect of addressing
adaptation]{.underline} today (Porter et al., 2017, Sandercock, 2004).
Colonialism continues to take many forms globally with systemic impacts.
Settler colonialism -- where colonial states appropriate Indigenous
Land, displace Indigenous Communities, and replace Indigenous Culture
with settlers\' -- has played a unique role in planning history (Barry
et al., 2018). [Planning institutions, such as private property and
development priorities, now globally employed, were initially shaped by
settler colonialism's focus on erasure, replacement, and permanent
settlement to facilitate upward wealth transfe]{.underline}r (Alexander,
2010, Moreton-Robinson, 2015, Sandercock, 1998, Sandercock, 2004).
Today, capitalism functions as a driving force of colonial wealth
transfer on a global scale, perpetuating resource extraction, land
commodification and community displacement (Porter, 2017; Tlostanova,
2017; Coulthard, 2014). [This history has left behind distinct
maladaptive path dependencies]{.underline} (MPDs) that continue to
constrain planning decisions and adaptation today.

Why does adaptation often fail to effectively address vulnerability?
There is an increasing body of research dedicated to exploring answers
to this question (e.g., Benevolenza and DeRigne, 2018; Cinner et al.,
2018; Eriksen et al., 2021; Field, 2018; Malik and Ford, 2024; Naylor et
al., 2020; Teebken, 2024). Here we further explore this question,
employing a post-structural and critical theory lens to elucidate MPDs
as a potential link across adaptation research and planning history.
Crucially, this framework enables exploration of how [maladaptation and
settler colonialism are intrinsically linked]{.underline} through MPDs,
[and]{.underline} how [this]{.underline} ultimately [constrains
adaptation planning]{.underline}. Lastly, we delve into alternative
paths offered through Indigenous worldviews, the importance of
biocultural relationships to adaptation, and decision-making barriers
that prevent a shift away from MPDs.

The authors of this paper sit within substantial privilege as settlers
and academics. They are informed through multidisciplinary backgrounds
across environmental science, urban policy and planning, climate change
resilience and economics, and cultural geography. The impacts of
colonialism and climate change on Indigenous Peoples have been, and
continue to be, immeasurable. Our intentions are never to summarize or
act as an authority on this subject. Rather, our intention is to
leverage our own privilege to increase awareness on how, despite
tokenistic attempts at reconciliation, [colonial MPDs continue to direct
planning decision-making]{.underline}. As advocated by Latulippe and
Klenk (2020), [this is an attempt to "make room" and invite further
collaboration on decolonizing adaptation research.]{.underline} We aim
to, by juxtaposing colonial and Indigenous land management practices,
expose the ongoing failures within the colonial planning regime and its
impact on adaptation.

Often adaptation is perceived as an issue of how society should change,
yet the preponderance of maladaptation suggests that a more pertinent
question is -- what needs to change and why isn't it changing?

2\. Maladaptive path dependencies

Climate change adaptation in theory often paints a utopian image:
abundant green infrastructure, effective public transportation, diverse
economies, scarce poverty and equitable public engagement. Here,
decision-making benefits the well-being of all, by addressing both the
physical and social sources of vulnerability. However, only through
transformation of social institutions, decision-making regimes and
infrastructure can this vision become reality -- a task requiring
careful planning (Barnett et al., 2015, Wilson et al., 2020). Yet, a
considerable gap exists between understanding adaptation in theory and
its implementation in practice (Rogers et al., 2023). Below we explore
the consequences and potential sources of this gap.

2.1. Maladaptation

Planning for climate change adaptation is most effective when resilience
is fostered prior to impacts occurring, making long-term strategic
policy an ideal means to address anticipatory adaptation (Field, 2018,
Noblet and Brisson, 2017, Tyler and Moench, 2012). However, [many
communities, overwhelmed by the sheer cost and magnitude of future
adaptation demands, lack consistent public support and bureaucratic
efficiencies necessary to plan for and implement adaptation]{.underline}
(Bowden et al., 2019, Dale et al., 2020, Shi, 2019, Singh and Birchall,
2019). Delayed decision-making often results in planning that is
ineffective, slow or lacking adaptation (Cinner et al., 2018, Eriksen et
al., 2021; IPCC, 2022; Kehler and Birchall, 2021). [Without deliberate
planning, unintended consequences can lead to
maladaptation]{.underline}, when adaptation measures result in increased
risk and vulnerability to climate change (Birchall et al., 2022a,
Bonnett and Birchall, 2020). In practice, adaptations, when they occur,
consist largely of mitigating physical exposure through expensive gray
infrastructure, such as sea walls (Bonnett and Birchall, 2020). [More
often than not, adaptation is reactionary, occurring after a
climate-related event]{.underline} when local governments are
overwhelmed by recovery needs (Birchall et al., 2021, Bonnett and
Birchall, 2020, Siders, 2017). Hard infrastructure adaptations may
provide a tangible barrier to oncoming change, yet they also encourage
new development in hazardous areas, foster public complacency to climate
risks, and increase long-term risk and maintenance costs (Kehler and
Birchall, 2023). While there is unequivocal need for occasional
reactionary infrastructure adaptations, reliance on only this approach
(and discounting community or infrastructure resilience) is leading to
maladaptation.

There is a theoretical understanding that conventional adaptation
approaches are not sufficient. In general, [resilience is best
approached through a dynamic socio-ecological systems approach that
weaves together both people and place]{.underline} (Davoudi et al.,
2013, Tyler and Moench, 2012). Anticipatory soft adaptation tends to be
more effective at mitigating physical vulnerability, as it shifts human
behavior to reduce exposure and increase resilience before an extreme
event occurs. This can be achieved, for example, through strict land-use
bylaws in hazardous areas or by bolstering ecosystem services (Bonnett
and Birchall, 2020; IPCC, 2022). [**Community resilience, built through
policy that deliberately addresses low adaptive capacity**, can
facilitate equitable decision-making and address the social and economic
factors that perpetuate vulnerability]{.underline} (Cinner et al., 2018,
Field, 2018). However, equitable use of these approaches is not yet
widespread.

2.2. Adaptation & path dependence

To avoid maladaptation, climate change adaptation, above all, must be
contextually appropriate (Eriksen et al., 2021). Climate change impacts
and a community's perception of them are unique to that place and time;
therefore, an adaptation approach that works in one place is not
guaranteed to work in another (Tyler and Moench, 2012). Local adaptation
approaches can vary significantly: Culture, values, access to resources,
and exposure to climate stressors influence how local governments plan
for adaptation (Adger and Barnett, 2009, Cinner et al., 2018). Yet, the
source of this diversity is often found in local history. Historical
context impacts how a community chooses to adapt through path dependency
(Cameron, 2012, Van Assche et al., 2022b).

In governance, path dependencies form over time as institutions around
land-use and political actors co-evolve to shape the landscape around
them (Van Assche et al., 2018). This co-evolutionary process is cyclical
and self-reinforcing, for better or worse. Land-use decisions are made
through formal institutions (such as policy), which reflect the informal
institutions (such as social norms) of the political actors that make
them. In turn, the landscape itself begins to reflect and perpetuate the
worldviews of dominant actors, historical informal institutions are
legitimized through formal policy, and the path dependency persists.

As communities scramble to adapt to climate change, MPDs suppress
necessary transformation. Past planning decisions constrain
decision-making capacity, reinforce institutions and maintain historical
status quo. Historical events and planning decisions engender long-term,
and often negative, impacts on local resilience, manifesting unique
local adaptation challenges (Van Assche et al., 2022a). Often, past
land-use decisions assumed perpetual ecological stability and, as
climate change worsens, old development resides in a newly hazardous
area; these short-sighted decisions compound vulnerability and constrain
effective adaptation (Birchall et al., 2025). Adaptation decisions tend
to be maladaptive, serving to justify historical approaches through
short-term economic productivity, rather than foster long-term
resilience (Kehler and Birchall, 2023).

Systems of governance often lack the necessary capacity to address such
complex spatial and temporal issues, and so MPDs deepen (Birchall et
al., 2023, Ford and King, 2013). Indeed, centralized, hierarchical
governance and top-down decision-making restrict local capacity to adapt
contextually (Bousema et al., 2022, Williams et al., 2020). Moreover,
legislative discretion in formal policy facilitates inaction through
blame avoidance and subjective risk perception (Birchall and Kehler,
2023). Consequently, political priorities such as short-term economic
development (which lower taxes and secure votes), take precedence over
adaptation, and maintain informal institutions that perpetuate inaction
(Andrew, 2008, Kniveton et al., 2015, Truong and Truck, 2016).

2.3. The burden of colonialism in adaptation planning

[While there has been an exclusion of colonialism from adaptation
research, there is **increasing**]{.underline}, yet sporadic[**,
awareness** of its role as a source of climate vulnerability and
constraint on adaptation planning]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012; Leal
Filho et al., 2022; Tran et al., 2021; Van Assche et al., 2022b). There
is, however, a much larger breadth of knowledge on the legacy of settler
colonialism as a barrier to good planning: It endures through
infrastructure, planning and governance processes, and frames the way
individuals interact with the world around them (Kunstler, 1993,
Osborne, 2013, Porter et al., 2017, Sandercock, 2004). By leveraging
MPDs, it is possible to connect research on colonialism and climate
change adaptation, enabling a better understanding of the institutional
and physical landscapes that perpetuate vulnerability today.

As settler colonialism was largely driven by extraction of local
resources (such as timber, minerals, animal pelts, etc.), Indigenous
Peoples were displaced or assimilated to enable settlements in
resource-rich areas (Barry et al., 2018, Moreton-Robinson, 2015). At the
time, planning was a tool wielded to impose colonial institutions (e.g.,
private property rights, deontological ethics and hierarchical
governance systems) onto stolen land, and to build infrastructure
networks that enable upward wealth transfer (Alexander, 2010,
Moreton-Robinson, 2015, Sandercock, 1998, Sandercock, 2004). Ultimately,
this process required a string of unfathomable wrongs -- including land
dispossession, cultural genocide, Indigenous Knowledge erasure -- which
formed a colonial MPD that planning continues to grapple with today
(e.g., Barry et al., 2018, Hibbard, 2022, Porter, 2004, Sandercock,
2004).

Despite the "end" of traditional settler colonialism, it is ongoing and
remains the primary path dependency of western communities. Informal
colonial institutions covertly drive maladaptive decision-making,
subsisting as a worldview and system of governance (Sandercock, 2004).
These institutions persist despite frequent conflict with planning
initiatives (Campbell et al., 2014, Kehler and Birchall, 2021). Colonial
land and resource management practices contribute significantly to
anthropogenic climate change, yet remain deeply embedded in planning
theory and decisio n-making (Cameron, 2012; Cameron et al., 2021;
Sandercock, 2004). Communities and infrastructure systems were built
for, and continue to rely on, the resource extraction and wealth
transfer that drove early settler colonialism (Birchall et al., 2022b,
Van Assche et al., 2022b). To expedite resource extraction from
appropriated land, formal systems of colonial decision-making evolved as
top-down, hierarchical and siloed (Mauro and Hardison, 2000, Zurba et
al., 2019). This form of decision-making facilitates fixed goals of
exponential wealth transfer, stripping profit from the communities that
generate it, while also leaving them with the exponential cost of
maintaining inadequate infrastructure (Birchall and Kehler, 2023, Thomas
and Twyman, 2006). Facing such challenges, short-term economic pressures
lock planning processes into further land appropriation for resource
extraction and development, thus perpetuating MPDs indefinitely (Barry
et al., 2018, Birchall and Kehler, 2023, Moreton-Robinson, 2015,
Tugjamba et al., 2021).

3\. Alternate paths

Colonial systems of land and resource management have severed
connections between people and place, perpetuating MPDs, by shaping the
landscape to reflect anthropocentric worldviews (Battiste, 2005, Nygren,
1999, Tlostanova, 2017). Beyond the colonial status quo and amidst vast
diversity, [Indigenous worldviews facilitate countless holistic
perspectives of knowing]{.underline} and understanding place (Dallman et
al., 2013, James, 2014, Tlostanova, 2017). Critically, [for adaptation,
this provides an opportunity to explore alternate approaches to informal
and formal social institutions, resource management systems and
knowledge systems that predate the current colonial MPD]{.underline}
(Mcmillen et al., 2014, Redvers et al., 2020). [Indigenous worldviews
offer critical insights into adaptation by emphasizing relational
governance]{.underline}, ecological stewardship, and context-specific
resilience building through biocultural relationships and adaptive
learning (Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003, Redvers et al., 2020).

3.1. Biocultural relationships for adaptive learning

Indigenous understanding of variability within socio-ecological systems
offers a nuanced perspective on climate change and adaptation (Cameron
et al., 2021, Mcmillen et al., 2014, Tugjamba et al., 2021). Holistic
perspectives of socio-ecological frameworks provide both a better
understanding of ecological systems and facilitate sustainable practices
and values (Brondízio et al., 2021). Critically, for adaptation
planning, this perspective reveals how biocultural relationships between
people and place facilitate adaptive learning.

Biocultural relationships are formed through a deep and personal
relationship with all living and non-living things (Leal Filho et al.,
2022, Redvers et al., 2020). This relationship begins by acknowledging
the complex system of interdependencies between sacred and secular
realms, accepting humanity's place within it, and valuing, above all,
reciprocity through a land-based ethic (Redvers et al., 2020). Emotional
connections to place provide an intimate understanding of the
interconnectedness of people and place within socio-ecological systems
(Tugjamba et al., 2021).

Biocultural relationships facilitate adaptive learning, a unique
knowledge building process that, through short-feedback systems between
knowledge generation and social institutions, is tightly coupled with
decision-making (Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003). Indigenous Knowledge
is contextual, intergenerational and inherently adaptive within
socio-ecological systems (Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003, Leal Filho et
al., 2022). In constant co-evolution with Indigenous Knowledge,
Indigenous institutions facilitate adaptive learning and produce a
resource management system that quickly responds to environmental change
(Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003). Indigenous institutions, not strictly
formal or informal as in colonial governance, are built within
biocultural relationships, prioritizing ecological stewardship and a
bottom-up, adaptive approach to decision-making (Brondízio et al., 2021,
Tugjamba et al., 2021).

The short-feedback systems within adaptive learning provide a regionally
contextual understanding of, and response to, the socio-ecological
effects of environmental variability (Mcmillen et al., 2014). However,
adaptive learning is not a response to the environment, but rather a
personal, emotional process that emerges as one journeys with the land
(Davidson-Hunt and Berkes, 2003). Adaptive learning is not a means of
applying or creating knowledge in a scientific sense, but rather the
outcome of a healthy relationship with place.

3.2. Making "use" of adaptive learning

The knowledge produced through adaptive learning is deeply contextual,
relational, and rooted in biocultural relationships, which substantially
enhance community resilience and adaptive capacity (Mcmillen et al.,
2014). In fact, in many cases, Indigenous Knowledge has offered profound
insights into complex ecosystems, shaped by generations of adaptive
learning and interdependence with the land (Fernández-Llamazares et al.,
2021, Reyes-García and Benyei, 2019). However, Indigenous Knowledge is
not a set of discrete skills or data that can be slotted into existing
western planning frameworks, and consequently, efforts to recreate,
extract or appropriate this knowledge have been largely unsuccessful
(Latulippe and Klenk, 2020).

Informal colonial institutions that disrupt biocultural relationships
and perpetuate MPDs also constrain Indigenous Knowledge inclusion in
planning decisions. Knowledge \"co-production\" is extractive, allowing
colonial resource management to further development goals by
appropriating and misrepresenting Indigenous Knowledge (Latulippe and
Klenk, 2020). Anthropocentric perceptions of nature misunderstand the
role of biocultural relationships in adaptive learning and discount the
importance of Indigenous institutions (Whyte and Cuomo, 2017). Design of
the built environment inherently separates humans and nature --
reflecting colonial perceptions of progress as linear, hierarchical and
segregated -- extinguishing the validity of holistic worldviews and
forcing assimilation into this status quo (James, 2014, Tlostanova,
2017, Van Assche et al., 2014). Overwhelmingly, planning such spaces
prioritizes development for economic goals and efficiency, at the cost
of public well-being (Kehler and Birchall, 2023, Tsoukala, 2011).
Consequently, human-made spaces reflect this position, re-engineering
complex and interconnected natural spaces into a rigid and organized
socio-ecological system that inherently lacks resilience and suppresses
biocultural relationships (Davoudi et al., 2013, James, 2014).
Irrevocably, anthropocentric colonial perspectives of place perpetuate
the technocratic, reactionary approaches to adaptation that underlay
maladaptation.

Appropriating and injecting Indigenous Knowledge into colonial systems
for adaptation will fail. For adaptation, the value of Indigenous
Knowledge does not stem from discrete historical data, but rather from
understanding the world through biocultural relationships
(Fernández-Llamazares et al., 2021, Mcmillen et al., 2014). Yet,
informal colonial institutions continue to erase the Indigenous history,
worldviews and institutions that biocultural relationships foster
(Latulippe and Klenk, 2020). Therefore, without Indigenous Leadership
and consent, the potential for adaptive learning is lost.

To truly make "use" of adaptive learning there must be a deep and
concerted effort to decolonize planning institutions, infrastructure and
governance. Indeed, there is an understanding that colonialism, and
planning's part in it, is unethical, and efforts are being made to
"unsettle" planning theory (Barry et al., 2018, Watson, 2003). However,
mirroring issues within Indigenous Knowledge inclusion, settler colonial
MPDs shroud the depth of the issue and attempts to decolonize have been
unsuccessful. For example, the Indigenous right to self-determination,
as required by the UN declaration of Indigenous rights, has largely gone
unrecognized across North America (French et al., 2020, United Nations,
2008). While many countries have set clear goals for reconciliation,
Canada, for example, has consistently failed to meet its own
expectations and, all too frequently in planning decisions, development
priorities take precedence over ongoing Indigenous injustices (Van
Assche et al., 2022b, The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada,
2015). Deep colonialism -- where informal colonial institutions are
embedded in formal decolonizing institutions (Rose, 1996) -- renders
planning processes unable to "unsettle." White supremacy, privilege and
token allyship perpetuate colonial dynamics and unfulfilled obligations
(Porter, 2004, Regan, 2010), while conflicting rationalities and
colonial planning regimes intertwine to maintain this status quo
indefinitely (Alexander, 2010, Watson, 2003).

3.3. Community-led pathways to address MPDs

[For communities, addressing the systemic and structural nature of MPDs
remains a challenge, yet it is **not impossible**.]{.underline} By
setting aside economic priorities and development goals in planning
decision-making, it is possible to redefine success beyond material or
economic terms and prioritize the primary planning ambition: the
well-being of entire communities. [To do so would challenge all settler
planners to "**make room and move over**"]{.underline} **[by co-creating
inclusive spaces]{.underline}** [for Indigenous Leadership]{.underline}
and Governance (Latulippe and Klenk, 2020). A critical first step is
passing, and upholding, local bylaws or policies that formally recognize
Indigenous Sovereignty and treaty-rights.

Beyond this, communities (both rural and urban) must avoid extraction or
appropriation of Indigenous Knowledge. Practical actions could include
allocating funding for Indigenous-led community initiatives and
mandating the inclusion of Indigenous planners, consultants and
knowledge-holders in all community planning projects. [To center
biocultural relationships in local decision-making, Indigenous-led land
stewardship boards with decision-making authority could be
established.]{.underline} Above all, ['using' adaptive learning to
address MPDs necessitates non-Indigenous planners cede authority and
**collaborate under Indigenous Leadership**, **recognizing their role**,
not as equals, **but as participants in an Indigenous-led planning
process**]{.underline}.

#### Resurgence [includes]{.underline} engagement with politics and the law

Jeff **Corntassel,** 20**21** - Dr. Jeff Corntassel is a writer, teacher
and father from the Cherokee Nation. He is currently Associate Professor
in the Indigenous Studies Department at the University of Victoria and

<https://journals.uvic.ca/index.php/adcs/article/view/20172/8930> //DH

Of the above-referenced elements, [[one of the most **misunderstood**
aspects of resurgence is]{.mark} the notion of [turning away from the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, Anishinaabe scholar Sheryl
Lightfoot mistakenly conflates critical engagement with settler
colonialism and a centering of Indigenous nationhood with "pessimism"
when describing resurgence, concluding that "\"e pessimism traps
together work to foreclose any possibility that there could be credible
openings of opportunity to negotiate a fairer and just relationship of
co-existence with even the most progressive state government."13
Additionally, Political Scientist Michael Murphy somehow treats
resurgence as being detached from relationality, and erroneously
contends that resurgence theorists advocate "\...a wholesale retreat
from state institutions\..." which "\...runs the risk of increasing the
vulnerability of Indigenous communities."14

However, when discussing resurgence in theory and in practice, and the
notion of turning away from the state, it becomes clear that
[[resurgence does not constitute]{.mark} a "wholesale [retreat from
state institutions." According to]{.mark}]{.underline} Yellowknives Dene
scholar Glen [[Coulthard]{.underline}:]{.mark}

> [[Does it require]{.mark} that [we vacate]{.mark} the field of [state
> negotiations]{.mark} and participation entirely? **[Of course
> not]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[Settler-colonialism has rendered us a
> radical minority]{.mark} in our own homelands, [and this
> **necessitates that we continue to engage with the state's legal and
> political syste**]{.mark}**m**]{.underline}. What our present
> condition does demand, however, is that we begin to approach our
> engagements with the settler-state legal apparatus with a degree of
> critical self-reflection, skepticism, and caution that has to date
> been largely absent in our efforts.15

As Coulthard discusses above, turning away from the state does not mean
complete disengagement. It does, however, entail a decentering of the
state and other colonial entities by consciously recentering Indigenous
nationhood and land-based governance. It also recognizes the limitations
of certain strategic engagements with the state, such as a rights-based
discourse.

Another mistaken conclusion that stems from the above-mentioned
misunderstandings of a "wholesale retreat from state institutions"
relates to Indigenous agency. According to Lightfoot, "By overlooking
and/or discounting Indigenous agency and not even considering the
possibility that Indigenous peoples could themselves be calculating,
strategic political actors in their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the
pessimistic lens of the resurgence school unnecessarily, unproductively
and unjustly limits the field of possibility for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus actually countering and inhibiting expressions of
Indigenous self-determination."16

When discussing how an exclusive focus on the rights discourse can
distract Indigenous peoples from their inherent responsibilities to
land, community and culture, resurgence theorists do not foster a
wholesale rejection of these strategies as Indigenous peoples use all
available means of mobilization to pursue and enact their self-
determining authority. Considering possible limitations of these various
strategies is much different than denying Indigenous agency. For
example, I contend that \"When addressing contemporary shape- shifting
colonialism, the rights discourse can only take struggles for Indigenous
decolonization and resurgence so far.\"17 There is system- atic
exclusion and violence taking place despite the appearance of a \'most
progressive state government\'.

A resurgence-oriented critique of a rights-based discourse suggests that
a careful, nuanced approach to human rights is warranted and, when
engaging in rights-based forums, one should understand the limitations
of the rights-based approach for achieving particular community
objectives relating to mobilization to strengthen self- determining
authority. In an attempt to identify perceived \'credible openings\'
relating to Indigenous struggles for self-determination, the
prescriptive approaches of Murphy, Lightfoot, and others run the risk of
minimizing a multiplicity of Indigenous forms of agency and worldviews
relating to resurgence and nationhood. Given the diversity of
approximately 5,000-8,000 Indigenous nations\' experiences,
perspectives, beliefs, and practices, it is problematic and a bit
presumptuous to characterize Indigenous actions that decenter the state
as pessimistic or as somehow misguided.

For example, the United Nations\' Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), in so-called British Columbia (Canada),
highlight the diverse strategies that Indigenous peoples employ when
asserting their self-determining authority. UNDRIP, which was ad- opted
by the UN General Assembly in 2007, is the most comprehensive Indigenous
rights instrument in effect today. Although Canada initially voted
against the Declaration (along with Australia, New Zealand and the
United States), it reversed its position (once there was a change in
administration) and removed its permanent objector status in 2016,
promising future implementation of UNDRIP.18 On November 26,2019,
province of B.C. legislators unanimously passed the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (UNDRIPA).19 While
this is an important moment toward the implementation of Indigenous
rights in B.C. and in Canada, the provincial Minister of Indigenous
Relations and Reconciliation emphasized that UNDRIPA would not give
\"legal force and effect\" to UNDRIP and would not immediately change
Indigenous-related law in B.C..20 Aside from UNDRIP, the United
Nations\' Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD),
of which Canada is a signatory, issued the following statement in
December 2019:

> \...calls upon the State party to immediately halt the construction
> and suspend all permits and approvals for the construction of the
> Coastal Gas Link pipeline in the traditional and unceded lands and
> territories of the Wet\'suwet\'en people, until they grant their free,
> prior and informed consent, following the full and adequate discharge
> of the duty to consult;21

Neither the passage of UNDRIPA nor the CERD appeals to Canada had any
noticeable impact in supporting the Wet\'suwet\'en hereditary chiefs\'
eviction notice to CGL on January 5,2020, despite the inter- national
and local documentation that CGL was on Wet\'suwet\'en territory without
their free, prior and informed consent. With the ink barely dry on the
recently-passed UNDRIPA, B.C. Premier John Horgan announced the CGL
project would proceed regardless of the eviction, informing the media
that \"the rule of law applies.\"22 While Wet\'suwet\'en hereditary
chiefs continue to seek a conversation with B.C. and federal officials
over the implementation of UNDRIP on their territory, they have
witnessed the limitations of a rights dis- course in protecting their
relationships to the land and CGL\'s dis- regard for free, prior and
informed consent. In the words of Freda Huson and others acting in
solidarity with the Wet\'suwet\'en: \"Reconciliation is dead.\"

Turning away from the state in the above example involves exposing the
illegitimate and unjust foundations of the state\'s authority. In
evoking the \"rule of law,\" Horgan demonstrated the contradictions
embedded in his understanding of UNDRIPA as well as ongoing violations
of Wet\'suwet\'en law. By decentering state authority and centering
Wet\'suwet\'en law, one can begin to see where energies can best be
directed to promote meaningful justice, accountability, and resurgence.
The Wet\'suwet\'en evicted CGL, in part, to protect their homelands from
further encroachment by industrial camp workers and to prevent violence
to their community. As Coulthard points out, \"It is only by privileging
and grounding ourselves in these normative lifeways and resurgent
practices that we have a hope of surviving our strategic engagements
with the colonial state with integrity and as Indigenous peoples.\"23
[[Resurgence is about regenerating]{.mark}]{.underline} our lifeways,
relational responsibilities, and [[sustainable pathways]{.underline} [so
that we approach engagements with states]{.underline}]{.mark} [and other
colonial actors [from a strength-based perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Diverse community strategies for Indigenous language revitalization,
which is a critical aspect of community resurgence, demonstrate that
multi-faceted approaches are employed to achieve resurgence through
state and other institutional engagements. With the goal of promoting
language speakers, there are multiple ways for teaching the language to
learners. For example, public schools may offer lan- guage programs that
are helpful in facilitating speaking and writing skills. Additionally,
Indigenous nations may offer in-person or online courses to help those
learning the language. Museums, non-govern- mental organizations, and
other state funded agencies may serve as resources for language
acquisition and development. Government grants may be available to
assist in teaching Indigenous languages at the community level.
International rights-based documents, such as UNDRIP, may provide the
legal basis to advocate for Indigenous language resources. Online
forums, applications, and groups can also be utilized for language
speakers. And there are other community- driven approaches to language
resurgence that may not require funding and are done more informally in
everyday settings, such as ceremonies and feasts.

All of the above exemplify different forms of engaging with the state
and other entities while maintaining a focus on language revitalization.
In this same respect, just as language is centered in the above
discussion, [resurgence prioritizes the strengthening of Indigenous
nationhood, which can be enhanced through multiple pathways involving
state engagement]{.underline} [but are ultimately community-driven
processes]{.underline}. According to Estes, \"Indigenous nationhood is
often misunderstood as an exclusive project - the sole aspiration of
just Indigenous peoples - or as confined within narrow definitions of
the nation-state.\"24 In other words, Indigenous nationhood doesn\'t
flourish in isolation - its grounded in multiple relationships that help
generate community health and well-being. As Simpson aptly states,
\"Resurgence cannot occur in isolation. A collective conversation and
mobilization is critical to avoid reproducing the individualism and
colonial isolation that settler colonialism fosters.\"25 Spaces of
Indigenous resurgence can open up anywhere that community exists and can
flourish within multiple contexts.

As the complexities of the above discussion on language revitalization
demonstrate, while turning away from the state is a strategic
orientation and positioning, it is not an abandonment of relations with
state actors; instead it is a reaffirmation of Indigenous \"radiating
relationships with plant nations, animal nations, insects, bodies of
water, air, soil, and spiritual beings with whom we share parts of our
territory.\"26 Turning away is also a way to act in contention with
aspects of state coercion that may attempt to align Indigenous nation
priorities with longer-term state goals via the politics of recognition.
According to Coulthard, there is a great danger when gearing Indigenous
peoples\' goals toward a \"recognition-based approach to reconciling
Indigenous peoples\' assertions of nationhood with settler-state
sovereignty via the accommodation of Indigenous identity-related claims
through the negotiation of settlements over issues such as land,
economic development, and self-government\"27

The politics of recognition is undergirded by settler colonialism, which
is premised on settler populations attempting to dominate Indigenous
landscapes and seascapes in order to maintain a permanent presence on
the land at the expense of Indigenous nations and peoples. Settler
colonialism as \"a structure, not an event\"28 is a collective of
shape-shifting entities that employ state coercion to govern through
overlapping structures of domination \"intrinsically shaped by and
shaping interactive relations of coloniality, racism, gender, class,
sexuality and desire, capitalism, and ableism.\"29 Consequently, acting
in contention with settler colonialism entails \"the disruption of
intersecting forces of power such as colonialism, heteropatriarchy and
capitalism.\"30 Despite shape-shifting colonial efforts to erase
Indigenous peoples from settler-dominated landscapes, Kanaka Maoli
scholar J. Kehaulani Kauanui describes the inherent dynamics of
\"enduring Indigeneity\" in which Indigenous nations and peoples
\"exist, resist, and persist.\"31 According to Kauanui, \"Understanding
settler colonialism as a structure exposes the fact that colonialism
cannot be relegated to the past, even though the past-present should be
historicized.\"32 Shape-shifting colonial entities are more than just
states - they are institutions, such as non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) and multinational corporations (MNCs) and other forms of power
that are exerted against Indigenous peoples and their complex
relationships. From this deep and ongoing history with settler
colonialism, Indigenous peoples are \"enduring\" because they do not
center colonial institutions in their everyday lives while also
identifying new ways to expose and challenge these ever-changing
coercive power dynamics.

So [what does it actually mean to turn away from the state
amidst]{.underline} a backdrop of [ongoing colonization]{.underline}?
First, it means truly coming to terms with the fact that Indigenous
bodies \-- men, women, girls, trans, two-spirit, and queer people \--
are viewed by colonial powers as, according to Mohawk scholar Audra
Simpson, \"a direct threat to their sovereignty and governmentality.\"33
The violence that occurs on Indigenous lands also takes place on
Indigenous bodies in distinct ways. Second, [turning away from the state
by centering [Indigenous nationhood does not entail an unwillingness to
engage with the settler state; **quite the
opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As political theorist Michael Elliott
points out:

> \...[[spaces of resurgence]{.mark}]{.underline} are structured not on
> but for the principle of reciprocity. They presuppose Indigenous
> centricity and authority, and in doing so [[figure settlers as guests:
> if they are to remain welcome, settlers are under requirement to adapt
> their behaviour to meet with conditions of
> hospitality]{.underline}]{.mark} that they have no say in determin-
> ing.34

[The process of [turning away from the state actually **invites settler
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding solidarity movements and
[[addressing injustices]{.underline}]{.mark}. Amidst discomfort and
unease with the current colonial system, [[settlers\' responses can set
the tone for protecting and expanding sites of Indigenous
resurgence]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is certainly the case with the
Wet\'suwet\'en in 2020 as settlers were asked to help blockade railways
and convey demands to politicians and policymakers regarding the
eviction of the RCMP and CGL from Wet\'suwet\'en homelands. Third,
[amidst resurgence movements, there is often an attempt to engage with
the state on multiple levels to generate accountability,]{.underline}
solidarity, and, where appropriate, to seek recourse from global forums.
This can take the form of invoking UNDRIP, the Inter-American Commission
on Human Rights, the Convention on Biodiversity, the Convention on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination, as well as the UN Permanent Forum
on Indigenous Issues. With the realization that these forums have limits
in terms of achieving resurgence aims, Indigenous nations make careful
decisions about where to direct their time and energy. Fourth, in
turning away from the state, Indigenous nations may initiate
collaboration and occasionally treaty-making between themselves to
conduct their own forms of diplomacy with other Indigenous nations.35
These international actions can sometimes render the state redundant in
terms of the mutual recognition of Indigenous nations and the exercise
of self-determining authority, both of which pose a credible threat to
the legitimacy of state governments.

Resurgence is not so much a proposal for effective social change as it

achieved and how over the later 20th and early 21st centuries. In some
senses, [resurgence]{.underline} as a concept [grows out of the attempts

\'unrecognise\' Indian Tribes across the country for various reasons)
and the attempts by the Canadian Government to dissolve the Indian Act
and Indian status (as outlined in the infamous 1969 White Paper4) are
clear parallels. [States]{.underline} in the mid-20th century [wished
to]{.underline} get out of \'the Indian business\', which is to say, to
**[eliminate their own fiduciary and legal obligations to Indigenous
People]{.underline}**. [It was only continuous activism that prevented
this]{.underline}, such as the Trail of Broken Treaties Caravan that
converged in Washington, DC, in 1972 and brought attention to the
failures of the American Government to honour its obli- gations, or the
Constitution Express that, beginning in 1980, pressured the Canadian
Government to consult with and include Indigenous interests in the draft
of the new Canadian Constitution. [In so much as these major activist
achievements improved conditions for Indigenous People across the
continent and forced settler colonial governments to accept that
Indigenous Nations could not simply be submerged in the past, they were
extremely successful]{.underline}. However, these movements also, to
some extent, revealed the limits of this sort of lobbying and protest.

#### The plan's an experimental act of decolonization that reverses state power and gives more control to Indigenous peoples

Discussion and conclusion

Recent critiques of 'collaboration' and 'participation' in the fields of
Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Indigenous Studies have drawn
attention to how these terms have risen to the status of generically
'good' things in diverse fields of governance and public
policy-making.47 As several STS scholars note, the turn to participatory
approaches emerged out of 'constitutional changes' in the relationships
between expert groups and wider society during the 1970s and 1980s, and
was ostensibly pursued in order to transform those relationships.48 This
arguably parallels moves within international policy-making to encourage
collaboration between state governments and 'local peoples', or, more
recently, Indigenous peoples, particularly in forms of natural resource
management and natural hazard management.49 To cite one prominent
example, the UN's Sendai Framework states that 'through their experience
and traditional knowledge' Indigenous peoples 'provide an important
contribution to the development and implementation of plans and
mechanisms' for disaster risk reduction.50 This demonstrates a set of
problems relevant to our concerns. There are many reasons why
traditional knowledge is a problematic basis for recognition or
inclusion, in part because, as Karuk fire ecologist Frank Lake argues,
it should not be assumed that Indigenous peoples have traditional
knowledge ready at hand or that they are willing or able to share it
(particularly with the settler state).51 A fixation on traditional
knowledge embeds our understanding of Indigenous peoples less within
their lives and experiences and more within their apparent alterity or
'timeless cosmological difference'.52 Such prescriptions on the grounds
for Indigenous recognition illustrate a key problem of participatory
governance more generally, namely their failure to reconfigure power
relations. The many techniques, programmes and forums devised to include
or collaborate with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities or
publics affected by a given policy matter have often simply
reconstructed the 'dynamics of closure and control that they seek to
overcome'.53 [By deploying a participatory approach, state actors may
often gain a social licence while continuing to retain the power to
parse between stakeholders, excluding some and including others who will
then have their demands diffused through exhausting consultative
processes]{.underline}.

Rather than take participatory governance as a banal good, Chilvers and
Kearnes suggest[, we should approach each instance of participation as
an]{.underline} empirical and contingent ['experiment' that can be
assessed according to its strategies and results]{.underline}; such
experiments are not pre-given but 'actively produce publics, public
issues, material commitments and forms of democratic engagement'.54
[This is a useful]{.underline} and novel [basis from which to approach
the collaborations that are emerging in]{.underline} Australia, Canada,
[the United States]{.underline} and elsewhere [between Indigenous
peoples and state agencies in relation to the governance]{.underline} of
country and, more specifically, bushfire management. Existing framings
imply either that such collaborations necessarily actualise Indigenous
peoples' aspirations, repress and coerce them to follow settler state
imperatives, or are a straightforward expression of Indigenous peoples'
traditional knowledge.55 These three responses position collaborations
as a predetermined expression of something innate rather than, as they
are often experienced by those involved, an emergent and pragmatic
experiment in exploring the bounds of what is possible. [While we are
apt to be suspicious of the institutions of settler governments, and the
motives of different actors, such summary analyses can obscure the
pragmatics and unexpected transformations that emerge through doing
collaborative or participatory work]{.underline}.

To return to Dja Dja Wurrung country, while it is possible to examine
collaborative bushfire management and detect the presence of familiar
influential forces, and colonial language, these tell us little about
what it has produced. Based on the narratives of those who have been
involved, the difficult work of 'walking together' has involved far more
than a contract, resourcing, traditional knowledge or government policy.
Even with many factors in its favour -- motivated actors, motivated
institutions, financial backing and so on -- it has been demanding on
those involved. While ongoing, we can say that this experiment has
produced three key hypotheses of relevance to other similar engagements.
First, recognised legal rights to country are not sufficient but may be
necessary for Aboriginal parties. Such rights not only place an
obligation on government agencies, but they also provide crucial
leverage for actors both within and outside those agencies to attract
resources and push back against institutional inertia and active
resistance. Second, both Aboriginal and non-Indigenous individuals have
to seek and gain trust from one another. Overcoming institutional and
historical barriers to creating such trust seems to be essential, in
part because it produces further commitment from peers and reduces
opposition. Third, and finally, agency employees have to go beyond their
official roles in order to sustain such collaborations. Strategic
improvisation may be required to make and protect space for Aboriginal
partners within such culturally White and institutionally conservative
contexts.

What does it mean to look at 'walking together' in bushfire management
as a decolonising experiment? [Our framework is not meant to imply that
at some point this 'experiment' could come to an end]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, finally, [be objectively assessed as successful (or
not). Engagements between Indigenous peoples and the settler state do
not have clear temporal or spatial boundaries as might be found in a
laboratory; rather, they involve interminable manoeuvring and agonistic
wrangling towards what seems like a better horizon for the subjects
involved]{.underline}. Calling engagements by Dja Dja Wurrung peoples
with settler government and its institutions 'experimental' is a way to
remain attuned to their open-ended and contingent character.
Celebrations of this particular collaboration's achievements, by
agencies and news media alike, can give a misleading impression of their
material and practical basis in a set group of sites, individuals,
practices and relationships within Dja Dja Wurrung country. These sites,
individuals, practices and relationships have been transformed or, to
use Chilvers and Kearnes' phrasing, actively produced through the
collaboration. They will continue to be actively produced together -- or
cultivated -- as more sites are chosen for traditional burning, as more
of these sites are integrated into agency plans and documents, as more
traditional burns are conducted, as DDWCAC invests more in its natural
resource management capacities and as more Dja Dja Wurrung people become
central to the everyday business of bushfire management.56

This makes apparent the decolonising character of the experiment, as, to
return to Tuck and Yang's definition, [the collaboration is materially
and structurally redistributing greater control over country into the
hands of Aboriginal traditional owners]{.underline}. [What is occurring
is not decolonisation in the sense of a complete and irreversible
transfer of authority, or withdrawal of settler colonial government, but
rather the **iterative decolonising renovation** of the political and
practical dominance of settler agencies]{.underline}. [These are modest
but real gains with nascent and unpredictable effects on those
involved]{.underline}. [Slowly, resources and authority are less solely
on the side of the government and its agencies]{.underline}. Here, we
arrive at a synthetic understanding of the decolonial and the
experimental. [A decolonising experiment is one that allows for 'the
emergence of questions that could not be asked before' because
Indigenous peoples are leading the management of their
country]{.underline}. [Such experiments materially alter ecologies, the
political and economic position of Indigenous peoples, and give rise to
new ideas about possible futures and new debates about how country might
be cared for differently]{.underline}. Perhaps, as some interviewees
wondered, Dja Dja Wurrung peoples will have an executive position within
bushfire agencies in the future? Or, as one Dja Dja Wurrung person said,
'I don't know why we don't run our own DELWP?'

#### Their perm answers are ahistorical -- progress has been achieved, and cooption risks run equally in the other direction -- Indigenous movements can use the state to [manipulate]{.underline} it from within

[Resurgence theorists]{.underline} take this criticism a step further.
Not only do they argue that existing reforms have failed to promote
Indigenous self-determination. In addition, they [argue]{.underline}
that the [reforms are part of a deliberate state strategy aimed at
co-opting Indigenous leaders and containing Indigenous
demands]{.underline} [while ensuring]{.underline} that truly empowering,
and [authentically Indigenous, alternatives]{.underline} to existing
economic and political power structures [are never seriously
considered]{.underline}.119

[I resist this stronger conclusion]{.underline} for several reasons.
First, while it is wise to maintain a healthy level of skepticism
towards the transformative potential of existing modes of Indigenous
empowerment, [there is]{.underline} simply [no denying that Indigenous
peoples have made important progress in their quest for
self-determination]{.underline}. For all their noted limitations, the
reforms discussed in this article -- [recognizing Indigenous nations,
languages and cultures; empowering Indigenous governments]{.underline},
legislators and political parties; [and increasing the influence of
Indigenous decision-makers over their lands]{.underline}, resources and
economies -- [have tracked a slow, but inexorable decline, of the era of
Indigenous assimilation]{.underline}. For example, in the span of three
or four decades, Indigenous peoples in Latin America have progressed
from a place where they were almost completely excluded from political
power and had their very existence denied to one where their leaders
exercise power at all levels of government and where their identities
and collective rights to language, culture, land and self-government are
entrenched in national constitutions.120 Similar stories of
transformative change have been unfolding over the last five decades in
Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Scandinavia.

My second objection speaks to the authenticity argument. [This argument
cannot be reconciled with the fact that Indigenous peoples]{.underline}
manifest identities, cultures, traditions and institutions that [are
incredibly diverse and]{.underline} subject to [change]{.underline} and
transformation [over time]{.underline}.121 [Attempting to define some
authentic core of indigeneity from this rich and shifting diversity is
not only bound to fail, it may also carry consequences]{.underline} for
Indigenous peoples [that are]{.underline} unduly restrictive and even
[oppressive]{.underline}.122 In the end, [to fully embrace the idea of
self-determination is to accept that Indigenous communities must be the
ones to decide whether the social, political and economic pathways they
follow are consistent with their individual and collective sense of
indigeneity]{.underline}.

Third, and finally, [while]{.underline} I agree that [the danger of
cooptation is real]{.underline}, many [resurgence theorists
underestimate Indigenous peoples and their ability to **successfully
subvert and manipulate** the very institutions and legal regimes that
were intended to limit or undercut their claims to
self-determination]{.underline}. In Latin America, for example,
neoliberal reforms have been widely criticized as antithetical to
Indigenous self-determination, yet Indigenous peoples have capitalized
on one of the key planks of that reform program -- decentralization --
to gain increased access to resources and political power at the local
level in Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia. Local empowerment was a key
factor that helped Evo Morales, and his Indigenous supporters, capture
the Bolivian presidency in 2006 and again in 2014.123 Further, in New
Zealand, the dedicated [Maori seats were originally conceived
as]{.underline} a temporary measure aimed at [coopting the Maori
leadership]{.underline} and undermining the movement in favour of Maori
self-determination. However, [the Maori declined to follow the script
provided for them by the colonial state. Instead]{.underline},
successive generations of [Maori representatives have used their voices
in Parliament to extend the authority of the Maori people over their
language, cultures, lands and resources]{.underline}, and to further
increase their influence over the affairs of the nation as a whole.124

In these cases, as in all of the cases discussed in this article,
Indigenous peoples have steadfastly refused to be contained by the
colonial state. Through the adoption of a broad, flexible and relational
strategy of accessing and exercising political power, Indigenous peoples
have both challenged and engaged with states to advance their individual
and collective human rights and well-being. In doing so, Indigenous
peoples have slowly brought to life their aspirations for
self-determination.

### 2ac -- pessimism trap

Pessimism Trap 2: The State is Unified, Deliberate and Unchanging in Its
Desire to Dispossess Indigenous Peoples and Gain Unfettered Access to
Indigenous Lands and Resources

In other words, [colonialism by settler states is a constant, not a
variable,]{.underline} in both outcome and intent. Further, the state is
not only intentionally colonial, but it is also unified in its desire to
co-opt Indigenous peoples as a method and means of control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadianand US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny it
a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years, 'the
state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to it'.27
According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders and
'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands to
accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a "solution" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of
Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still colonial insofar
as it remains structurally committed to the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples of our lands and self-determining authority'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states first
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel limits and actually **[demeans Indigenous
agency]{.underline}**, [overlooking the reality that Indigenous
organisations themselves chose the human rights framework and rights
discourse as a target sphere of action precisely because, as was evident
in earlier struggles like slavery, civil rights or women's rights, these
were **tools available to them**]{.underline} [that had a **proven track
record** of **opening up new possibilities** and shifting previous state
positions and behaviour]{.underline}. [Indigenous advocates]{.underline}
also cleverly [realised,]{.underline} by the 1970s, that the
anti-discrimination and [decolonisation frames could be used together
against states]{.underline}. States did, in no way, nefariously impose a
rights framework on Indigenous peoples. Rather, Indigenous organisations
and [savvy Indigenous political actors]{.underline} deliberately [chose
to frame their self-determination struggles within the human rights
framework in order to bring states into a **double bind** where they
could not credibly claim to adhere to human rights and claim that they
uphold equality while simultaneously denying Indigenous peoples' human
rights and leaving them with a diminished and unequal right of
self-determination]{.underline}. But, [because he is caught in the
pessimism trap of seeing the state only as unified, deliberate and
unchanging, Corntassel]{.underline} overlooks and
[diminishes]{.underline} the clear story of [Indigenous agency and the
potential for positive change in advancing self-determination in a
multitude of ways]{.underline}.

Pessimism Trap 3: Engagement with the Settler State is Futile, if Not
Counter-Productive

Since the state always intends to maintain, if not expand, colonial
control, and is seeking to co-opt as many Indigenous peoples as possible
in order to maintain or expand its dispossession and control, it is
therefore futile, at best, and actually dangerous to Indigenous
existence to engage with the state. Furthermore, all patterns of
engagement will lead to co-optation as the state is cunning and
unrelenting in its desire to co-opt Indigenous leaders, academics and
professionals in order to gain or maintain control of Indigenous
peoples.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1.On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2.Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3.Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the need
for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated systems
of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in both
urban and land-based settings'38;

4.Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and reflective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5.Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political configurations of power that we
initially sought...to challenge'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for
'critical self-reflection, skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent
politics of recognition that seeks to practice decolonial,
gender-emancipatory, and economically nonexploitative alternative
structures of law and sovereign authority grounded on a critical
refashioning of the best of Indigenous legal and political
traditions'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is created.41 He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel finds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly 'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of
inclusion' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
'channeled' and 'blunted' by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical
time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to bringing
Indigenous rights concerns to global forums'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus the
Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

All of these writers advocate Indigenous resurgence, through a
combination of rejecting the current reconciliation politics of settler
colonial states, coupled with a return to land-based Indigenous
expressions of governance as the only viable, 'authentic' and legitimate
path to a better future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
decolonisation. While inherently critical in their orientation, these
three approaches do make some positive and productive contributions to
Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the various and subtle
ways that [Indigenous]{.underline} leaders and communities [can become
co-opted into a colonial system]{.underline}. They help us to hold
leadership accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our
traditional, cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional
forms of governance which then also helps us imagine future
possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, all three theorists are also caught
in the same three pessimism traps: authenticity versus co-option; a
vision of the state as unified, deliberate and never changing in its
desire to colonise and control; and a view of engagement with the state
as futile, if not dangerous, to Indigenous sovereignty and existence.
When combined, [these three pessimism traps aim to inhibit Indigenous
peoples' engagement with the state in any process that could potentially
re-imagine and re-formulate their current relationship into one that
could be transformative and post-colonial]{.underline}, as envisioned by
the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The [pessimism
traps together work to foreclose any possibility that there could be
credible openings of opportunity to negotiate a fairer and just
relationship of co-existence]{.underline} with even the most progressive
state government.

This pessimistic approach is not innocuous. **[By overemphasising
structure]{.underline}** [and granting the state an enormous degree of
agency as a unitary actor, this pessimistic approach does a remarkable
disservice to Indigenous resistance movements by
proscribing]{.underline}, from academia, [an extremely narrow view of
what Indigenous self-determination]{.underline} can and [should
mean]{.underline} in practice. [By overlooking]{.underline} and/or
[discounting Indigenous agency and not even considering the possibility
that Indigenous peoples could themselves be calculating, strategic
political actors]{.underline} in their own right, and vis-à-vis states,
[the pessimistic lens]{.underline} of the resurgence school
unnecessarily, [unproductively]{.underline} and unjustly [limits the
field of possibility for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making,]{.underline} [thus actually]{.underline} countering and
**[inhibiting]{.underline}** expressions of **[Indigenous
self-determination]{.underline}**. [By condemning]{.underline}---writ
large---all [Indigenous peoples]{.underline} and organisations [that
wish to seek peaceful co-existence with the state]{.underline},
negotiate mutually beneficial agreements with the state, and/or who have
advocated on the international level for a set of standards that can
provide a positive guiding framework for Indigenous-state relations,
[the pessimistic lens of resurgence forecloses much potential for new
and improved relation]{.underline}s, in any form, [and is very likely to
lead to deeper conflicts between states and Indigenous peoples,
and]{.underline} potentially, even **[violent action]{.underline}**,
which Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism traps of
the resurgence school are]{.underline} therefore, likely
**[self-defeating]{.underline}** for all but the most remote and
isolated Indigenous communities. Further[, this approach is]{.underline}
quite [out of step with the]{.underline} actions and [vision of many
Indigenous resistance movements]{.underline} on the ground who have been
working for decades to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
domestically and globally, in ways that transform the colonial state
into something more just and may eventually present creative
alternatives to the Westphalian state form in ways that could respect
and accommodate Indigenous nations. Rather, it aims to shame and blame
those who wish to explore creative and innovative post-colonial
resolutions to the colonial condition.

The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (the Declaration
or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 after 25
years of development. The Declaration is ground-breaking, given the key
leadership roles Indigenous peoples played in negotiating and achieving
this agreement.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN history, the
rights holders, Indigenous peoples, worked with states to develop an
instrument that would serve to promote, protect and affirm Indigenous
rights, both globally and in individual domestic contexts.46

Many Indigenous organisations and movements, from dozens of countries
around the world, were involved in drafting and negotiating the UN
Declaration and are now advocating for its full implementation, both
internationally and in domestic and regional contexts. In Canada, some
of the key organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees
(Eeyou Istchee), the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British
Columbia Indian Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were
involved in the drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration
during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations
like the American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights
Fund have been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous
peoples' governing institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and
the Sami Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights.
In Latin America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
major transnational Indigenous organisations---the World Council of
Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty Council and the
Inuit Circumpolar Council---were all key members of the drafting and
negotiating team for the UN Declaration, and the latter two, which are
still in existence, continue their strong advocacy for its full
implementation.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a significant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements. [States are not
going to implement]{.underline} this multifaceted and complex set of
[changes on their own]{.underline}, however. [They will require
significant political and moral pressure to hold them accountable to the
rhetorical commitments]{.underline} they have made to support this level
of change. They will also require ongoing conversation and negotiation
with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process becomes
problematically one-sided. Such processes ultimately require sustained
political will, commitment and engagement over the long term, to reach
the end result of radical systemic change and Indigenous state
relationships grounded in mutual respect, co-existence and reciprocity.
This type of [fundamental change requires]{.underline} creative
thinking, careful diplomacy, tenacity, and above all**[, optimistic
vision]{.underline}**, on the part of Indigenous peoples. The
[pessimistic approaches]{.underline} of the resurgence school
[are]{.underline} ultimately [of little use]{.underline} in these
efforts, other than as a cautionary tale against state power, of which
the organisational players are already keenly aware. Further, by
dismissing and discouraging all efforts at engagement with states, and
especially with the blanket [accusations that all who
engage]{.underline} in such efforts [are '**co-opted'**]{.underline} and

[Resilience thinking may be]{.underline} predominately [friendly to
capitalism, but]{.underline} it is [not completely so]{.underline}. It
may be more accurate to say that resilience thinking, as a whole, is
conflicted about its stance on capitalism. Thus [we must avoid the
pitfall Gibson-Graham showed Marxists to have fallen into. We need not
replace resilience in toto with another concept, but instead work to
grow the non-capitalist options that exist within resilience
thinking]{.underline} currently. To do this, resilience thinking needs
to integrate concepts from radical political economy. This will help
resilience thinkers understand more clearly than they currently do
capitalisms implications and alternatives, how capitalism interacts with
non-capitalist modes of production and consumption, and what this means
for applying resilience thinking in specific locations.

1.6 Radical Resilience: A New Framework for Steering Arctic Change

The theoretical framework of radical resilience retains many of
resilience thinking's core concepts and metaphors. The unit of study is
still social-ecological systems, as defined by researchers. Systems are
still described in terms of their persistence, adaptability, and
transformability. Models such as the adaptive cycle and panarchy are
still utilized to conceptualize change over space and time. The
difference in [radical resilience]{.underline} is that it [brings into
resilience research and politics an epistemological lineage that
explicitly questions the ideology of neoliberal capitalism]{.underline}
-- [it brings]{.underline} a type of [skepticism]{.underline} or
criticality [around exploitative systems]{.underline} of production and
consumption [that resilience thinking has largely lacked]{.underline}.
In radical resilience, the relationship between capitalism and
social-ecological systems becomes a subject to study and evaluations,
rather than an assumed, or naturalized, structure of the system. To
achieve these goals, radical resilience must use vocabulary from radical
political economy to shape its research questions.

A quote from Robbins (2004) exemplifies the type of vocabulary that
resilience needs to incorporate to become more radical. He writes, "No
explanation of environmental change is complete...without serious
attention to who profits from changes in control over resources, and
without exploring who takes what from whom" (p. 75). While environmental
change is obviously within the purview of resilience thinking, it would
be very surprising for a resilience scholar to write about social agents
taking or profiting from one another in the way that Robbins uses the
terms. When resilience thinkers want to indicate that something is wrong
with a system, they tend to use terms such as undesirable system state
and lock-in trap, but these terms obscure the human agency that is
ultimately responsible for the condition being analyzed. This issue goes
back to the critique discussed earlier about resilience thinking's
tendency to naturalize processes that lead to social inequity and
environmental degradation that are actually caused by human choice, and
therefore avoidable.

Turner (2014) attributes resilience's hesitancy to think critically
about the social dimension of social-ecological systems to its claim to
objectivity. He writes, "Ecologists may feel that as biophysical
scientists they escape the 'bias' that plagues much of social science";
but Turner expresses skepticism in that claim when he adds, "\[T\]he
choice of the appropriate parameter become particularly difficult and
dare I say, normative, for open socio-ecological systems" (p. 620).
Turner also suggests that the human struggle, pain, and injustice that
is endured by some groups as social-ecological systems adapt and
transform, are abstracted and largely ignored in resilience-based
modeling. This unwillingness to engage difficult topics, Turner
continues, has led to a "disturbing voyeurism -- coming too close, for
many social scientists, to social Darwinism" (p. 621). Turner's
criticism suggests a need for academic resilience thinking to overcome
its normative reluctance. Table 1.1 presents the contrasting approaches
to social-ecological systems and the resultant outcomes of three schools
of thought -- capitalism, conventional resilience thinking, and radical
resilience.

[Radical resilience]{.underline}, drawing on Marxism, [posits that the
social inequity inherent in capitalism is something that society has a
moral obligation to avoid]{.underline} (Harvey, 1982, 1996; Smith,
1984). Drawing on eco-Marxism, radical resilience posits that society
also has a moral obligation to avoid the unsustainable environmental
degradation caused by capitalism (Foster 1999, 2002; O'Connor, 1988).
However, tempered by post-Marxist theory (Gibson-Graham, 1996), radical
resilience is not purely anti-capitalist, but instead seeks to explore
the relationship between capitalist and non-capitalist values and
material outcomes and analyze what this means for the resilience of
social-ecological systems. [Under radical resilience, society has a
moral obligation to provide care for other human and non-human
lifeforms]{.underline}. A radical resilience research agenda includes
the following questions (which I return to in the dissertation's
Conclusion):

• What are the key social-ecological dynamics of the given system?

• Who benefits from the arrangement, at what scale, and how much?

• Who suffers from the arrangement, at what scale, and how much?

• Is power equitably distributed in this arrangement?

• In this context, what should be made resilient to what and for whom?

#### Community empowerment is [radical resilience]{.underline} that can challenge capitalism

Lastly, a [reconstructed resilience thinking could empower action that
leads to genuine movement away from capitalistic social-ecological
relations]{.underline}, and some research suggests that is already the
case (e.g., MacKinnon & Derickson, 2013). [This might include
communities separating themselves from global flows of capitalism in a
return to local production and consumption. It might see communities
accessing global flows of capital, but then using them for communal
purposes]{.underline}, thus **[subverting the logics of capital
accumulation]{.underline}** [and creating heterogeneous systems where
multiple modes of economy exist side-by-side, like those suggested by
Gibson-Graham]{.underline}. The key in terms of action, is to prevent
capitalists from using resilience thinking as a discursive tool to make
people believe that it is their responsibility, as individuals or
communities, to absorb the harms of capitalism.

Perhaps the most important alteration for the research, theory, and
action aspects of a rebuilt resilience thinking is the conceptual move
of framing capitalism as an undesirable system trait rather than a
natural social-ecological condition. Remember, getting rid of capitalism
here does not mean getting rid of markets or the exploitation of labor
to produce surplus value, which are acceptable, but rather getting rid
of the appropriation of that surplus value by an elite class, which
leads to harmful social-ecological relations (i.e., externalities).
Resilience thinking is a powerful conceptual framework that can be used
to steer transformations in a desirable direction. It is up to critical
scholars to wrestle the definition of 'desirable' away from the
capitalist agenda and to save resilience thinking from its unfortunate
ingestion of the contradictions of capitalism.

Radical resilience is exciting because it provides a well-reasoned and
specific idea for harnessing existing resources to increase social
well-being and environmental sustainability. It takes the resilience
thinking bundle of theory, research, and action that we already have and
points in a new direction. It builds on the essential work of critiquing
resilience and tries to take the next step of reconstruction. It is
hopeful and optimistic because it emphasizes 'the good' in alternative
ways of doing economy---[we can still produce and consume and invest, we
just have to do it in ways that subvert capital accumulation by the
elite]{.underline}. Perhaps this is a step towards creating systems of
social, environmental, and economic relations that are every bit as
efficient and energized as capitalist systems, but based on an
entrepreneurship of communal well-being, rather than of selfish greed.
The interpretation of resilience described above allows a radical
rereading of the three case studies the dissertations presented
previously.

### 2ac -- alternative fails

#### The alternative fails and [entrenches]{.underline} colonialism -- the state will assert itself inevitably, and direct action techniques are [insufficient]{.underline} to resist

Michael **Murphy**, 20**19** -- Professor, Faculty of Indigenous
Studies, University of Northern British Columbia "Indigenous Peoples and
the Struggle for Self-Determination: A Relational Strategy." Canadian

//DH

Additionally, not all Indigenous peoples are opposed to participating in
state institutions. Some are, but many others maintain that
participation is a crucial means of shaping or influencing state
policies that impact their rights, interests and well-being.21 Beyond
this purely functional rationale for Indigenous participation, evidence
from multiple jurisdictions, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
the United States and Latin American countries suggests that many
Indigenous people value their engagement with the political, social, and
educational institutions of the wider society. These Indigenous peoples
embrace their status as state citizens and as citizens of their own
self-determining Indigenous communities. Similarly, there is no
consensus among Indigenous peoples regarding the compatibility of
Indigeneity and the pursuit of capitalist modes of economic development.
Many Indigenous communities have adopted and modified capitalist
economic development. As a result, they have reaped significant economic
benefits, but also augmented their capacity to advance some of their key
social, cultural and political objectives in the process.22

Perhaps [the biggest weakness of a resurgence approach lies in its
response to the power imbalance that profoundly shapes Indigenous-state
relationships worldwide.]{.underline} [While this approach accurately
diagnoses the severity of this power imbalance]{.underline} -- what
Coulthard refers to as the "sheer magnitude of discursive and
nondiscursive power we find ourselves up against in our struggles" --
ultimately [it fails to offer a convincing strategy for counteracting
its effects, and for advancing an extraordinarily ambitious program of
Indigenous economic and political independence]{.underline}.23 [A
strategic withdrawal from the state]{.underline} may very well aid the
process of self-decolonization, but it **[will not stop state judicial
and legislative bodies from asserting their jurisdiction over Indigenous
territories]{.underline}**, governments and economies. [Nor will it stop
state policy governing activities]{.underline} ([e.g. resource
extraction, industrial development, environmental review) on lands
adjacent to Indigenous communities from continuing to impact Indigenous
territories]{.underline}, environments and well-being. Finally, [it will
not change the fact that many Indigenous communities will continue to be
dependent on the state for economic support, programs and services and
the building and maintenance of public infrastructure]{.underline}.24

Indeed, a wholesale [retreat from state institutions runs the risk of
**increasing the vulnerability** of Indigenous communities]{.underline}.
This would occur [by ensuring that Indigenous people have no voice, and
thus, no influence in those very same institution]{.underline}s (e.g.
courts, legislatures, constitutional forums, resource consent and
co-management bodies) [that significantly impact their rights, interests
and well-being]{.underline}. [Although direct action can be]{.underline}
an [effective]{.underline} tool for advancing or defending Indigenous
interests, [past experience suggests that it is no magic bullet in the
struggle for self-determination]{.underline}. [Direct action campaigns
are difficult to sustain over longer periods of time because they
sometimes aggravate internal community divisions and alienate outside
sources of support]{.underline} and solidarity, [frequently achieve only
limited objectives and in many cases, **fail outright**]{.underline}.25
The [limitations of direct action are even more apparent for smaller
Indigenous communities that lack financial and organizational resources
as well as external allies]{.underline}. However, even in countries like
Bolivia and Ecuador where very large, well-organized and resourced
Indigenous social movements have made significant advances towards
self-determination, there is a perception that direct action on its own
is inadequate to achieve the desired scale of reform. This perception
led Indigenous activists to pursue parallel and complementary
institutional routes to advance their goals -- most notably, electoral
politics.26 Therefore, it is crucial to understand both the advantages
and limitations of direct action, and to acknowledge that this approach
is more effective as part of a broader, multi-pronged strategy of
advancing Indigenous self-determination.

#### Framing the alternative in [exclusive]{.underline} terms replicates settler logic and blocks transformation

Native Nations

[The most fundamental principles of i]{.underline}nternational
[law]{.underline} thus [establish that]{.underline} the Native nations
of the \"lower forty-eight\" states, the [Indigenous nations in
Alaska]{.underline}, and Native Hawaiians [constitute peoples with the
right to self-determination]{.underline}. In light of their long-
standing relationships with the territory now occupied by the United
States---their rights to and responsibilities for these lands---[there
is no reason, other than raw colonial power, why they should not be
recognized as non-self-governing peoples with a right to
decolonization]{.underline}. And [that]{.underline}, in turn, [means
that it is their decision as to whether they wish to be independent, to
be incorporated into the settler state, or to negotiate a compact of
free association]{.underline} on terms acceptable to all parties. (These
rights, of course, also apply to external US colonies of Puerto Rico,
Guam, the Northern Marianas, \"American\" Samoa, and the \"US\" Virgin
Islands.81)

[This raises the possibility of an entirely different configuration of
\"American\" territorial rights]{.underline} and responsibilities.
[Indigenous peoples]{.underline} on territories claimed by the United
States [also have a right to restitution with respect to stolen lands
and natural resources]{.underline}, and to both compensation and
satisfaction for the egregious harms inflicted upon their peoples. And
[it is at this point that we encounter the \"fear factor]{.underline}.\"
In my experience it is difficult to have a rational discussion about
decolonizing American society with anyone who is not Indigenous [because
the very idea triggers a defensive reaction that]{.underline} generally
[manifests as \"but then we\'d have to leave]{.underline},\" quickly
followed by \"and I don\'t have anywhere to go.\"82 As this reaction
illustrates, [it is useful for settler culture to project sovereignty
and identity as **all-or- nothing** propositions]{.underline}, [leaving
non-Indigenous peoples to imagine that their disappearance is the only
alternative]{.underline} to the status quo. Because this is not a
thinkable alternative, [it allows them to dismiss the foundational issue
of colonial occupation without even addressing it]{.underline}.

In fact, however, [it was]{.underline} Angloamerican [settlers,
not]{.underline} American [Indian nations, who imposed their
**presumption of exclusivity**]{.underline}, who arrived with a firm
conviction [that they could live on this land only if Indigenous peoples
were eliminated]{.underline}. As Dean Saranillio observes, \"Imagined
violence on the part of Indigenous movements is a common trope that
allows Native savagery to stand in for settler self-critique.\"83 But it
is the settler state that has always imposed itself through violence.
[What decolonization actually entails is a relinquishment of the
settlers\' self-assigned entitlement to encompass everything and
everyone within their state]{.underline}; in other words, their
insistence that only they have the right to be self-determining.84
[Indigenous nations \"encapsulated\" within the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [have rarely if ever called for the departure of
all settlers]{.underline} or other migrants, \"[but rather
accountability for their discourses]{.underline} and practices
[that]{.underline} ultimately [come at Native expense.\"]{.underline}85
[The presumption that relinquishing exclusive settler sovereignty
equates to a wholesale evacuation of the territory]{.underline} by non-
Indigenous peoples [does not reflect any material reality but simply an
inability to conceive of living with]{.underline}, or within, [others\'
polities]{.underline}.

#### The state will infiltrate and violently suppress local movements

[Settler colonialism does not]{.underline}, however, [depend solely on
the oppression of Indigenous peoples. Much racial inequity derives from
the settlers\' drive to create a low-cost, optimally controlled labor
force that is readily accessible and disposable.]{.underline} This tells
us that wages, working conditions, and security of employment are a
priority, and that the exploitation of vulnerable immigrant workers and
the use of prison labor as well as offshore enslaved or child labor must
be contested---not only because fundamental human rights are at issue
but also because these practices fuel the colonialism that keeps us all
subordinated.

Similarly, it is apparent that the settler class prioritizes the control
of all conceivable forms of social interactions. [Racialization
continues to remove those deemed Other from settler spaces and to
contain them physically, so- cially, economically, politically, and
psychologically]{.underline}. [Every day people of color are attacked by
vigilantes or law enforcement, or have the police called on them simply
for being in purportedly public spaces]{.underline}.52 This means that
every day we have opportunities to counter these practices, doing
whatever it takes to protect those who are being assaulted. More
generally, we can see the im- portance of resisting the appropriation of
geographic and social spaces, the ever-expanding reach of criminal law,
and the militarized violence of contem- porary policing.

The intensity of the states reaction is a good way to gauge the
effectiveness of actions intended to disrupt colonial relations of
domination and subordi- nation. [We have seen that American Indians
defending their homelands and enslaved Africans rising in rebellion have
long been the stuff of settler nightmares, providing an excuse for the
states use of overwhelming military force against those who would assert
their independence]{.underline}. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the
FBI\'s counterintelligence programs ([COINTELPROs) priori- tized
\"neutralization\" of the American Indian Movement]{.underline} and
Puerto Rican Independentistas.53 [Pursuing \"Black Nationalist-Hate
Groups,\" law enforce- ment agencies engaged in particularly vicious
attacks on the Black Panther Party but]{.underline}, in addition,
[targeted]{.underline} virtually [all]{.underline} predominantly African
American activist organizations, [regardless of their tactics, goals, or
ideologies]{.underline}.54 This reflects a perceived need to eliminate
any viable, independent forms of social organization---and tells us that
developing autonomous and self-sufficient communities is an important
dimension of decolonization.

Since the 1960s, [the most intense and devastating domestic deployment
of police power has not targeted terrorist]{.underline}s---that is,
those who would en- gage in armed attacks on civilian populations for
purposes of coercion or intimidation---[so much as those who act, or
advocate action, independent of state power.]{.underline} Thus, for
example, in 1971 local police and the FBI launched an armed attack on
the Jackson, Mississippi, headquarters of the Republic of New Afrika
(RNA), a group that had purchased land in the hope of establish- ing \"a
self-sufficient nation for black people---and one safe from the violence
routinely inflicted on them by whites,\" as summarized by a reporter for
the Jackson Free Press.55

With even more devastating effect, in 1985 the Philadelphia police
bombed a house occupied by members of MOVE, a group committed to \"a
commu- nal \'back to nature\' lifestyle, vegetarianism, reverence for
all animal life, and scorn for \'The Establishment.\'\"56 City officials
let the house burn, incinerat- ing eleven MOVE members, including five
children, and allowing more than sixty surrounding residences to be
destroyed.57 The federal governments chemical attack on the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, and the ensuing inferno that killed
forty-nine adults and twenty-seven children less than a decade later,58
illustrates that the state is motivated not simply by racism but by a
profound need to maintain control over everyone within its claimed
boundaries.

What we see of settler state priorities today is entirely consistent
with this history. The heavily militarized law enforcement units
mobilized to crush the entirely peaceful gatherings of water protectors
at Standing Rock, North Dakota, in the winter of 2016-2017 were part of
a larger effort targeting In- digenous movements (and their allies)
determined to prevent extractive in- dustries from causing further
environmental damage.59 [Canadian police have explicitly labeled such
activists \"Aboriginal extremists\" in order to encompass Indigenous
struggles for self-determination within the governments \"war on
terror]{.underline}.\"60 In the United States, [the Department of
Homeland Security has labeled them \"environmental rights
extremists\"]{.underline}61 [or]{.underline}, in the alternative, [the
dupes of extremists who \"attempt to exploit indigenous causes for their
own ideological purposes]{.underline}\"62---a framing that conveniently
sidesteps questions of American Indian sovereignty and treaty
compliance.

Since 2015 we have seen an upsurge in the activity of White supremacist
organizations, many of which openly advocate the use of armed force
against ci- vilians as well as governmental institutions.63 Although
such entities accounted for three-quarters of the 372 people killed by
\"extremists\" between 2007 and 2016,64 White supremacist organizations
are not being treated as a major threat. It is \"inescapably clear,\"
history professor Kathleen Belew observes, that \"white power activism\"
has been facilitated by \"the lack of public understanding, effec- tive
prosecution, and state action.\"65 Perhaps this is because their primary
goals are the elimination or more effective subjugation of people of
color in what they deem to be \"their\" country---in other words,
because their narrative is remark- ably congruent with the origin story
of the American settler state.

Black activists, by contrast, do not need to take any action to be
treated as a security threat. In August 2017, [the FBI\'s
Counterterrorism Division issued an \"intelligence assessment\" warning
that \"Black identity extremists]{.underline} (BIEs)\" were likely to
engage in premeditated attacks on law enforcement officers because of
the \"perceptions of unjust treatment of African-Americans and the per-
ceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement.\"66
Questioned by congresswoman Karen Bass, attorney general Jeff Sessions
was unable to identify any African American group that had targeted
police officers, could not explain why there was no similar report on
White extremists, and refused to say whether he considered Black Lives
Matter an extremist organization.67 According to the Foreign Policy
article that made this report public, the term \"black identity
extremist\" was recently invented, perhaps as \"part of a politically
motivated effort to find an equivalent threat to white supremacists.\"68
The FBI defines BIEs as \"individuals who seek, wholly or in part,
through unlawful acts of force or violence, in response to perceived
racism and in- justice in American society and some do so in furtherance
of establishing a separate black homeland or autonomous black social
institutions, communi- ties, or governing organizations within the
United States.\"69 Despite the in- coherence of this sentence, quoted
directly from the Bureaus \"intelligence assessment,\" we can glean from
it that (1) persons willing to consider violating the law to contest
racism and injustice will be targeted, and (2) the Bureau attaches
particular significance to those who advocate separatism or support
\"autonomous\" Black communities or institutions.

[It is important to note the intensity with which Indigenous and envi-
ronmental activists, as well as people of color]{.underline} who assert
a right to social or political autonomy, [are being set up for violent
attacks and extrajudicial kill- ing,]{.underline} without any credible
evidence that they pose a serious threat to public safety.70 This means
that the views and actions of these groups are believed to be capable of
interfering with the settler states ability to proceed with busi- ness
as usual. As a result, [they need to be]{.underline} both studied and
[defended---not just ideologically, but]{.underline} [physically,
legally, and financially]{.underline}---by those interested in
dismantling colonial structures of racialized privilege and
dispossession.

### 2ac - permutation

#### The [absolutist]{.underline} nature of their links is politically vacuous -- the permutation is a better mode of resisting capitalism

Gibson-Graham's central argument is that [Marxists]{.underline} have
inadvertently **[strengthened capitalism]{.underline}** [by producing a
discourse that presents it as an absolute]{.underline}, all
encompassing, [inescapable phenomenon --]{.underline} or Capitalism with
a capital 'C'. In so doing, the argument goes, [Marxists have engendered
a situation where the only perceivable alternative]{.underline} to
capitalism [is a complete]{.underline} and total working-class
[revolutio]{.underline}n. The entire social system of the world must be
replaced by a whole new system. [The problem]{.underline} with this
understanding of capitalism [is that in light of the
failure]{.underline} and fall of many [of]{.underline} the world's
[communist governments, the working class revolution seems like **an
impossible dream**]{.underline}. In turn, [Marxists]{.underline} of all
stripes [have been rendered **frustrated** and **empty handed**
in]{.underline} [terms of 'solutions']{.underline}. "It is the way
capitalism has been 'thought'", Gibson-Graham writes, "that make it so
difficult for people to imagine its supersession" (1996, pp 4.)

Gibson-Graham deconstructs the radical political economy discourse on
capitalism to show that capitalism is not actually all encompassing and
that [non-capitalist modes of production and consumption occur all the
time]{.underline}, all over the place, [right alongside
capitalism]{.underline}. They effectively argue for seeing the economic
field of society as a differentiated plane, with multiple types of
economic relations coexisting. When one views the situation thus, it
becomes clear that a complete and total working-class revolution is not
the only viable option for bringing about positive change. [One can
instead focus on the small day-to-day projects that offer immediate
realizations of the benefits of capitalism's alternatives.]{.underline}

At the center of their deconstruction is their understanding of Marx's
definition of capitalism. Marx defined capitalism as a system of
production and consumption wherein the means of production are
controlled by an owning class while the production itself is provided by
a laboring class. The value of the work the labors provide is more than
they are paid for, which allows the owning class to syphon-off surplus
value in the form of profit. It is the appropriation of surplus value
(i.e., capital accumulation) by one entity away from another that
constitutes exploitation and defines capitalism. Gibson-Graham
demonstrates instances where this type of exploitation is not occurring:
self-employment (where surplus value is appropriated by the laborer);
cooperative businesses (where surplus value is appropriated by
employee-owners, consumer-owners, and reinvested into the community);
and household production (where labor is never transformed into its
monetary value form, thus providing no surplus to be appropriated).
Gibson-Graham also bring to light the fluidity of economic identities,
showing how an individual can be both an exploited laborer at their day
job, for example, but an appropriator of surplus value through the
investment of their retirements funds in the stock market. "Economic
sites that have usually been seen as homogenously capitalist,"
Gibson-Graham explains, "may be reenvisioned as sites of economic
difference, where a variety of capitalist and non-capitalist class
processes interact" (1996, p. 18).

Similar approaches to studying alternatives to capitalism include work
on moral economies (Scott, 1977), Buddhist economics (Schumacher, 1973),
and sharing (Gold, 2004). In sum, [alternatives to capitalism can
be]{.underline} viewed as those processes of [production and
consumption]{.underline} of goods and services---and the
social-ecological relations the processes intimate---[wherein the
driving force is not the maximization of capital accumulation by an
elite class of owners, but rather the maximization of social-ecological
well-being]{.underline} through an equitable distribution of the
products of human labor.

Pulling away from Gibson-Graham and returning the purposes of this
dissertation, an important question emerges. If capitalism's
alternatives are still predicated on the production of surplus value
through the exploitation of labor (humans) and raw materials (non-human
environments), [do these modes of economy]{.underline} offer any real
promise for [remedy]{.underline}ing the social and environmental
[impacts of capitalism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} thereby
[contributing to the of resilience of Indigenous communities in the
Arctic?]{.underline} On the social front, it is relatively straight
forward to see how alternative modes of production/consumption and
distribution enhance social justice and equity---surplus value is
distributed equitably among many rather than horded by a few. Similarly,
on the environmental side, we know that communally owned natural
resources can be sustainably managed (Ostrom, 1990). [By replacing
profit maximization with equitable well-being as the key driver of
economies]{.underline} (Figure 1.4), [alternatives to capitalism make
room for decisions that are more ecologically sound than those
determined by capitalist logic]{.underline}.
