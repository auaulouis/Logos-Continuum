[Recently, **[the Arctic began to be treated as a "geopolitical
hotspot]{.mark}**" and as a "resource frontier."]{.underline} The
region's international (i.e., interstate) dynamics has been drawing the
attention of scholars and policymakers seeking to make sense (and take
advantage) of emerging geopolitical and economic phenomena in the
region[. One of **[the main driver]{.mark}**s of such efforts **[is
the]{.mark}** so-called **[Arctic resource boom]{.mark}**]{.underline}
-- an enhanced knowledge on the resource endowment of Arctic seas and
lands, especially in terms of the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral
reserves. Since the publication of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal
in 2008, such [**[knowledge of the region has]{.mark} only
[increased]{.mark}**, **[and triggered]{.mark}** a plethora of
**[economic development projects]{.mark} for the region** -- most geared
towards **making the commercial exploitation of such resources
viable**.]{.underline} Such plans, [typical of neo-extractivist modes of
development and capital accumulation,**[1) demand new instruments and
technologies of control over land, territory and
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- not only in enabling the resource
exploitation, but also in displacing Arctic Indigenous populations that
inhabit spaces where resource-based economic activity is meant to take
place. This process has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at
controlling space and mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis
calls "striation activities". [**[2)]{.mark}**Theorizations and
**[debates on]{.mark}** the **[Arctic]{.mark}** resource boom or on the
**[geopolitical tensions]{.mark}** rising in the region **[are]{.mark}
generally [oblivious to indigenous political
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}, institutions and articulations in the
region. [**[This]{.mark}** erasure **[takes]{.mark}** the **[colonial
violence]{.mark}** underlying the relation **[between Arctic States and
Arctic indigenous peoples out of sight]{.mark}**]{.underline}, obscuring
the violent history of expropriation underpinning contemporary Arctic
geopolitics and economic development. Another effect of such
perspectives is the presentation of the Arctic as an "empty" space,
devoid of people, social dynamics and politics other than those
developed and brought by Westphalian States.[**[3) This position seeks
to justify State interventions]{.mark}** in the region **[for]{.mark}**
"properly" **[seizing emerging economic and strategic
opportunities]{.mark}** -- **[with]{.mark}** little to **[no regard for
indigenous cultures]{.mark}** and subsistence in the Arctic, nor to the
already sensible effects of climate change in the region.The present
article seeks to frame **[the "Arctic resource boom"]{.mark}**
**[as]{.mark}** **a new wave of [Arctic settler
colonialism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [We argue that, although **[projects
for resource exploitation]{.mark}** of the Arctic are achieving
unprecedented scale, they **represent a [continu]{.mark}ity of [the
colonial project]{.mark}**, **benefitting from** the way **previous
waves of colonization** have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the
relations between Indigenous peoples and their traditional
territories.]{.underline} Our discussion is focused on the impacts of
colonialism over the Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- [the Inuit
homeland]{.underline} -- [and the impacts of colonialism over the
relation between State, indigenous peoples and Arctic
spaces]{.underline}. Then we move on to a discussion of [the Arctic
resource boom and the strategic and development projects emerging in the
Arctic policies of littoral states and their treatment of indigenous
issues amid economic and strategic pressures to carve out new extractive
enclaves in Arctic territories.]{.underline} We depart **[[from a
historical account of Arctic colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, seeking
[to understand how the colonial encounter **[between Inuit and
Euro-American populations]{.mark}** and the importance of resource
extraction shaped contemporary Arctic spaces]{.underline} -- from baleen
and whale oil to the gold rush and discovery of hydrocarbons. [One
important element here is to understand how **this first moment of
[colonialism set up the conditions for modern-day resource development
projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The discussion, then, turns to
contemporary economic development projects in the Arctic, understanding
them as neo-extractivist enterprises -- i.e., enterprises that rely
heavily on resource development and control over space in a late
capitalist globalized economy. As such, [these projects represent a
geographical expansion of extractive frontiers in a global scale,
seeking new resource reserves and to reshape space to make them
commercially viable. **[This represents]{.mark} a [new]{.mark} wave of
[colonialism]{.mark}** -- i.e., of **[attempts by state and capital to
enhance control over]{.mark} traditional [indigenous
territories]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- and a new wave of threats and
attempts at dispossessing Arctic Indigenous Peoples from their rights to
their traditional lands and livelihoods.

### 1NC \-\-- Link \-\-- Democracy

#### Democracy and colonialism are inextricably intertwined.

University of London and the Vice President of the British Society for
Middle East Studies, John Hopkins University Press,

For some time now I have been pondering the closely knit relationship
between democracy and colonialism. Notwithstanding the widespread
conception among democracy theorists that there is a contradiction
between the two,^2^ in this paper I contend that [[**colonialism** has
**served as a crucial component** **in** the]{.mark} historical
[processes through]{.mark} which modern [**democracies** were created
and sustained]{.mark}]{.underline}.^3^ Focusing on the production of
"the people"---namely, those who are acknowledged as citizens and
consequently have been granted the right to participate in political
decisions---I maintain that [[**colonialism**]{.mark} has been [deployed
by democracy]{.mark} as a force that **[unifies]{.mark}**, limits, [and
stabilizes the people]{.mark} within the metropole **[by employing
violent]{.mark}** forms of **[exclusion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And yet,
unlike other forms of exclusion which have been deemed accidents or
aberrations and regarded as symptoms of democracy's evolutionary
development,^4^ political scientists have often assumed that colonialism
is totally alien to democracy and indeed antithetical to the two basic
democratic principles: sovereignty of the people and equality. I, by
contrast, follow post-colonial theorists to argue that [**[colonialism
is a strategy]{.mark}** employed by democracies]{.underline} (and, of
course, other regimes) [**as a way [of achieving]{.mark}** not only
**[geopolitical]{.mark}** and economic **[goals]{.mark}**, but also as a
way of accomplishing social and political objectives within the
metropole]{.underline}.^5^ [[Colonial]{.mark}ism]{.underline}, in other
words, also [has a strategic role at home and the different forms of
[power]{.mark} that manifest themselves in the colony [can be readily
traced back to the democratic metropole]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover,
the series of [[**exclusions that colonialism produces**
**are**]{.underline}]{.mark}, I claim, **[[part of democracy's very
logic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and can operate in tandem with democracy's
basic principles. Insofar as this is the case, the democracy/colonial
relationship can teach us something important about democracy for it
reveals, using Michael Mann's phrase, one of the dark sides of the
so-called best possible regime. It underscores, for example, how
[[democracy's universalist and inclusionary claims are always bound up
in colonial exclusionary practices]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
implemented through the deployment of violence. My objective in this
paper, however, is to further complicate this relationship by suggesting
that the colonial practices and mechanisms deployed by democracies to
limit and stabilize the people tend to return to haunt the democratic
colonizers. [Colonialism ends up engendering processes that destabilize
the notion of the people and, consequently, produces a double movement
that both contracts and extends democracy]{.underline}. What begins as a
project of subjugation, may, at times, acquire an unexpected edge of
inclusion. Israel and Colonialism The peculiar or, more precisely,
bewildering relationship between democracy and colonialism is
exceptionally urgent for me because I live in Israel. To be sure,
according to the dominant worldview the Jewish state is the only proper
democracy in the Middle East. Former President George W. Bush said as
much when he appeared before the Israeli Knesset in 2008: "We believe
that democracy is the only way to ensure human rights. So we consider it
a source of shame that the United Nations routinely passes more human
rights resolutions against the freest democracy in the Middle East than
any other nation in the world." 6 President Barack Obama made a similar
point when he spoke to AIPAC: "Our job is to rebuild the road to real
peace and lasting security throughout the region. That effort begins
with a clear and strong commitment to the security of Israel, our
strongest ally in the region and its only established democracy."7 [The
notion]{.underline} that [Israel is the only democracy in the Middle
East is informed by the production of "the people" and the formation of
the nation]{.underline}. Although [one cannot conflate the people with
the nation]{.underline} (after all, in Israel 20 percent of the citizens
are Palestinians and accordingly not part of the nation), [taking the
nation into account is also]{.underline}, no doubt, [crucial for
understanding the connection between democracy and colonialism. Indeed,
[**it is through the demarcation of the people** **and**]{.mark} the
**[careful configuration]{.mark} of [the nation]{.mark}** that Israel
[can be]{.mark} at one and the same time **[both a democracy and a
colonizing state]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.8]{.mark} There are numerous
ways to conceptualize Israel's colonial project depending on one's
historical and political perspective, but here I will discuss only the
1967 occupation and disregard the colonization project that took place
before Israel's establishment and the ethnic cleansing of 1948/49.9
Israel, which celebrated its sixty-first anniversary last May, has
occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem for over forty-two years.10
Israel's sovereignty currently extends throughout the area between the
Jordan Valley and the Mediterranean Sea. Within this region
approximately 5.6 million Jews and close to 5.2 million Palestinians
currently reside.11 Out of this population, three and a half million
Palestinians and almost half a million Jews live in the areas Israel
occupied in 1967 (excluding the Golan Heights), and yet while these two
groups live in the same area, they are subjected to totally different
legal systems. The Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories are
still stateless and lack the most basic human rights. By sharp contrast,
all Jews---whether they live in the Occupied Territories or within the
pre-67 borders---are citizens of the State of Israel and enjoy basic
human rights.12 [Israel]{.underline}, I maintain, is [considered a
democracy only because one third of the people residing within the
borders it controls are not regarded as part of "the
people]{.underline}." So even if one adopts a foreshortened historical
perspective, one that begins in 1967, it is fairly obvious that [the
so-called "only democracy in the Middle East" is simultaneously a
colonizing state]{.underline}. [All of which raises the question of the
relationship between the colonial presence and the democratic
state]{.underline}.13 It seems obvious that **[[the democratic colonial
project engenders and reinforces the distinction between legitimate
national citizens and]{.mark} precarious [colonized
subjects]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It can do so because [in democracies
**["the people" is]{.mark}** always **[an unstable signifier]{.mark}**
that is periodically **[redefined through]{.mark}** the deployment of
[mechanisms of **exclusion and inclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Colonialism provides democracy a series of mechanisms which generate a
twofold process: [[**colonialism** **helps produce, demarcate and
stabilize the national subject**]{.mark} of democracy, **while the
nation** then **[restricts]{.mark}** or almost totally restricts
**[citizenship]{.mark}** to those who are deemed legitimate
members]{.underline}. Israel's colonial project, in other words, assists
the state in molding an otherwise disparate people who immigrated to
Israel from numerous countries across the globe over a period of more
than one hundred years into one unified national ethnic group (i.e.,
Jews).14 [[This act of molding is dependent on daily practices of
exclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} that manifest themselves through the
domination of Palestinians as well as on inverse depictions of the self
and other; the Jewish self is portrayed as progressive, civilized and
civilizing and as having a rich history, while the Palestinian other is
depicted as backward, uncivilized and lacking history. The Palestinians
are also portrayed as extremely violent and incapable of real
democracy.15 Because there has always been a sacrosanct relationship
between nationality and citizenship, [[the **colonial
project**]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[assists in]{.mark} the
justification and **[legitimization of]{.mark} the [uneven]{.mark}**
[distribution of **citizenship**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The national
subject]{.mark} receives citizenship automatically and is
[incorporated]{.mark}]{.underline} as part of the people, while [[the
colonized subject]{.mark} is either totally or partially
[excluded]{.mark}]{.underline}. Etienne Balibar adds that the
"[dangerous classes" were allowed access to citizenship only on
condition that they transform themselves into constituent parts of "the
body" of the nation, and therefore into (real or imaginary) foremen of
imperialist domination]{.underline}.16 In other words, **[[the inclusion
of]{.mark} certain [groups]{.mark} into the people [was contingent
on]{.mark} their [willingness to]{.mark} participate in the
[dominat]{.mark}ion of [colonized populations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
Israel, some of the most marginalized groups---Mizrahi Jews, new
immigrants and Druze---comprise the majority of the people making up the
border police brigade, which is responsible for much of the ethnic
policing in the Occupied Territories. Scholars have shown that the
integration of these groups within the military has facilitated their
upward mobility in Israeli society.17 The Israeli case helps clarify
that the colonial project is not merely the other of democracy. On the
one hand, Israel's colonial project is deployed to limit and unify the
people and in this way helps manage democracy's precarious and unruly
elements. On the other hand, Israel's truncated racialized democracy
serves to preserve its colonial project since as indicated by the quotes
of US leaders, democracy is incessantly utilized to extend, hide and
legitimate a colonial regime based on violent domination.
**[[Democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we see, **[has [deployed
colonialism to circumscribe itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (i.e., by
demarcating and stabilizing the people); **[[colonialism]{.mark} has
[needed democracy to produce its legitimization]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The Historical Context Israel, it is important to note, is a unique case
only insofar as the democratic project and the colonial project coexist
within a contiguous space.18 [Historically, the two projects have
frequently co-existed, but within separate spaces]{.underline}, thus
suggesting that space is very important since the [non-contiguous
spatial relation has helped conceal the intricate democratic colonial
connection]{.underline}.19 Even today one could point to Spain's
relation towards Ceuta and Melilla in Morocco and Britain's relation
towards Gibraltar. Wendy Brown notes that "[[liberal
**democracies**]{.mark} in the First World **[have always required other
peoples to pay]{.mark}**---politically, socially, and
economically---**[for what these societies have
enjoyed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is, [there has always been a
**colonially and imperially inflected gap between** **what** has **been
valued** in the core **and what** has **been required** from the
periphery]{.underline}."20 Alice Conklin adds: Any historian in the
field of modern European or American history sooner or later must
confront one of the fundamental paradoxes of the last century: [the
acquisition and rule by force of colonies by the most advanced
democracies]{.underline}, the United States, France, and Great Britain.
Whatever the official claims, [**[Western colonization]{.mark}** during
this period **[was]{.mark}** in large part **[an act of state-sanctioned
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the crudest level, [**[liberal
regimes forcibly 'pacified' native peoples]{.mark}** who resisted
colonization]{.underline}. On a more subtle level, [their rule rested on
a set of coercive practices that violated their own democratic
values]{.underline}.21 One way to clarify the first part of my inquiry
is by asking whether Conklin's historical depictions do indeed
illustrate a fundamental paradox, as she claims, or whether the
colonization projects carried out by these democracies were part of the
very exclusionary logic of modern and ancient democracy. We can say,
with considerable confidence, that **[[democracies were always invested
in violent exclusionary practices deployed to limit and stabilize the
people]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is, ironically, not much new about
this claim. Discussing citizenship, for example, Balibar mentions the
"[permanence of a rule of closure \... where fellow citizens and
foreigners are clearly distinguished in terms of rights and
obligations]{.underline}." He adds that the "[move from ancient to
modern citizenship is marked by a continuity, that of the principle of
exclusion,]{.underline} without which there would be no community and
thus no politics\...."22 Hence, [exclusion appears to be the condition
of possibility of any community]{.underline}. Democratic communities are
no exception, which leads me to suggest that [**exclusion is** actually
**part of the democratic logic** and not antithetical to
it,]{.underline} and that **[colonialism]{.underline}** is **[one of its
pronounced manifestations]{.underline}**. The Double Movement The
historical relationship between democracy and colonialism raises a
series of questions. One cluster of questions which post-colonial
theorists have examined focuses on comparative research such as how the
exclusionary practices employed within democratic colonial projects
differ from other exclusionary practices operating in democracies like
exclusions based on race, gender and class. Along similar lines,
scholars have asked how democratic colonial projects (e.g., France and
Britain) differ from fascist or authoritarian colonial projects (e.g.,
Japan and Portugal). Caroline Elkins and Susan Pederson show, for
example, that: **[settler power and settler privilege coincided most
intensely in territories under the authority of liberal or republican
metropoles]{.underline}**: in such instances---as with the pieds noirs,
or Southern Rhodesia's secessionist farmers, or indeed the American
founding fathers---[**[democratic or republican ideology]{.mark} clearly
[served]{.mark}** less as a restraint on]{.underline} [the exploitation
of indigenous peoples than **[as an important resource for settlers
seeking to enhance their]{.mark}** autonomy and
**[privilege]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By contrast, [while authoritarian
or antidemocratic regimes]{.underline} (those of Japan, Germany, and
Italy in the 1930s, and of Portugal) [often treated indigenous
populations with unrivaled brutality]{.underline} (as in Ethiopia or
indeed Poland), in [some instances that very state authoritarianism
could act, paradoxically, to attenuate formal settler
power]{.underline}.23 In other words, [**[settlers]{.mark}** often
**[exploited freedoms]{.mark}** and civil rights which were conferred on
them [**as citizens** of]{.mark} their [democratic state]{.mark} of
origin **[in order to subjugate]{.mark}** and oppress [the
indigenous]{.mark} population]{.underline} in ways that settlers
originating from authoritarian regimes could not. The numerous reports
dealing with settler violence suggest that this has also been the case
in Israel.24

### 1NC \-\-- Link \-\-- Renewables 

**Renewable energy is settler colonialist through the colonial aspects
of renewable energy infrastructure and the idea of energy colonialism,
which is intrinsically tied with the systemic process of colonization**

Franziska **Mueller** 20**24** \[Franziska Mueller is a researcher and
the University of Hamburg, Germany; 2024; "Energy Colonialism";
https://journals.librarypublishing.arizona.edu/jpe/article/id/5659/ ;
Journal of Public Ecology\]

[[The concept of energy colonialism evolved in the early
2000s]{.underline}, [namely as a critique of large-scale renewable
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} (RE) production in Northern Africa under the
auspices of the \"Desertec Project.\" Yet, while such connections to
activism underpin it, a lack of theoretical rigor has limited the
concept\'s analytical use. [[Energy colonialism is not an all-too-flat
ontology or a mere metaphor]{.underline}, [and is historically grounded
within **the systemic processes of colonization**]{.underline}]{.mark},
including entanglements of capitalism and coloniality (Bhambra & Newell,
2022; Tuck & Yang, 2012). To overcome this, unpacking energy
colonialism\'s ideational history requires locating the concept in
relation to other neighboring concepts that seek to put nature to work.
[\"Carbon colonialism\" entered debate in the mid-nineties, referring to
the fear that forest-abundant countries in the Global South were used as
territories ripe for green investment while greenwashing the ecological
debt of the Global North.]{.underline} The critique of carbon offsetting
and emission trading became prevalent, particularly regarding the Kyoto
Protocol\'s joint implementation mechanism, which, as representatives
from the Global South feared, would result in the Global South being
considered a carbon sink at the advantage of industrialized countries
(Heller, 1995). Later works (Bachram, 2004; Bumpus & Liverman, 2010;
Paterson & Stripple, 2012) further elaborated the concept by
establishing parallels between historical colonialism and today\'s
carbon offsetting schemes, and thus, defined it as \"a new form of
colonialism which utilizes climate policies to bring about a variation
on the traditional means by which the global South is dominated\"
(Bachram, 2004, p. 10), resulting in access restrictions and
land-grabbing, and displacement and environmental injustice (Bumpus &
Liverman, 2010; Lyons & Westoby, 2014). Bachram (2004) concluded that
...the dynamics of emissions trading, whereby powerful actors benefit at
the expense of disempowered communities in both North and South, [[is
**a modern incarnation of a dark colonial
past**]{.underline}**.**]{.mark} European colonialism extracted natural
resources as well as people from the colonized world. (p. 18) [Another
perspective, \"climate coloniality,\" is a much broader concept that
explores how colonialism and climate crisis are interconnected,
centering on the historical responsibility of colonizers in the Global
North. Recently, particularly controversies over \"loss and damage\"
have sparked debate on climate colonialism, particularly at the COP27
meeting in Egypt in 2022 (Abimbola et al., 2021).]{.underline} Expanding
the term to include lived experience and using empirical evidence,
Sultana (2022) [reminded us that ...climate coloniality occurs where
Eurocentric hegemony]{.underline}, neocolonialism, racial capitalism,
uneven consumption, and military domination are co-constitutive of
climate impacts experienced by variously racialized populations who are
disproportionately made vulnerable and disposable, \[occurring\] through
global land and water grabs, REDD+ programs, neoliberal conservations
projects, rare earth mineral mining, deforestation for growth, fossil
fuel warfare, and new green revolutions for agriculture. (p. 4) [[She
linked these forms of colonial and colonizing agency to the lived
experience of racialized populations with]{.mark}]{.underline} \"slow
[violence]{.mark}\" (Nixon, 2011), based on historical injustices and
colonialism\'s geophysical echoes (Lewis & Maslin, 2017; Todd & Davis,
2018). Lastly, \"green colonialism\" or \"environmental colonialism\"
(Agrawal, 1991; Alimonda, 2011; Brookfield, 1992; Dorn, 2022; Nelson,
2003) refers to interventions into Southern ecologies, [[which resemble
colonial discourses and practices]{.underline}]{.mark}, by imposing
power over nature and pervading nature--society relations,
[**[extracting environmental resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Galeano,
1971/1997; Svampa, 2019), [or engaging in displacements, driven by the
Cartesian separation between human and nature (Escobar, 2011; Federici,
2004; Patel & Moore, 2018). Such interventions perpetuate colonial power
relations and point to the externalities caused by the Global North
exploiting the health, labor, and land of the Global South (Hickel et
al., 2022). Research refers to timber trade and forest protection
programs (Kwashirai, 2009; Müller, 2020), displacements in national
parks due to forms of nature conservation stemming from the colonial era
(Duffy, 2014), land-grabbing and green extractivism (Normann, 2021;
Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2021), or large-scale hydrogen projects
(Dillman et al., 2022; Kalt & Tunn, 2021; Müller et al.,
2022).]{.underline} These different forms of Western dominance over
nature highlight the extent to which interventions into nature--society
relations reflect a colonial mindset, assuming that nature does not have
a legal status and is ready to be commodified. However, while these
concepts share a critique of Western interventions into nature--society
relations and root this in the long and haunting global history of
Eurocentrist power and domination over nature (Patel & Moore, 2018),
[they do not specify the [particularities that render energy systems and
the political economies of energy as a seminal sphere for **old and new
colonial interventions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They do not refer to
specific sociocultural aspects, [that is]{.underline}, what
environmental humanities consider to be \"[energy
cultures]{.underline}\" (Stephenson et al., 2010), [such as resistance
toward new energy technologies against energy extractivism or societal
adaptation processes]{.underline} (Boamah, [2018). Another particularity
lies in the power-laden and competition-driven understanding of external
energy policies]{.underline}, visible in the security dogma and norms of
competition, [which are still the dominant rationales underpinning
external energy relations and resulting in a geopolitical power
grip]{.underline} (Kalt & Tunn, 2022; Knodt et al., 2015). Furthermore,
[as energy infrastructures create long-lasting
interventions]{.underline}, [they require continuous resources for the
built environment]{.underline}, often on a transregional scale, and
intertwined with a nation\'s economy, [which is why energy path
dependencies pose such a hindrance to transitions]{.underline} (Förster
& Bauch, 2014; Kallianos et al., 2022). In close correspondence to the
Eurocentric dichotomies present in development theories, [energy is
portrayed as the epitome of progress and modernity]{.underline},
boasting significant innovations in industrial history, following the
Enlightenment\'s period\'s designs to dominate and exploit nature.
Indeed, the modernist idea that nature can be \"put to work\" [and can
be turned into a commodity is]{.underline}, by and large, reflected in
the thermodynamic equations that render wild and untamed nature as
burnable carbon (Lohmann, 2021; Tornel, 2023). Finally, on a discursive
level, [colonial narratives about Blackness and Whiteness are
mobilized]{.underline}, visible in light-and-dark narratives associated
with renewables, [energy poverty]{.underline}, [and energy
transitions]{.underline}. They form part of development aid narratives
while mirroring the enlightenment mindset, technological dominance, and
White savior narratives (Girvan, 1978; Jarosz, 1992). These points
underscore that energy transition processes differ from concepts that
problematize other forms of green extractivism or [green
colonialism]{.mark}. Therefore, [investigating **[colonial aspects of
energy infrastructures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, policies, transition
processes, or projects requires a more specific and multidimensional
concept.

"colonialism is a shape-shifter." In this sustainability renaissance,

the relative absence of land use regulation and lack of financial
incentives (and access to upfront capital) for tribes to own and develop
energy infrastructure. This means that Tribes typically lease land for
infrastructure placement without actually reaping the benefits of
ownership, electricity access, environmental accreditations ([renewable
energy credits or carbon credits]{.underline}), or tax credits---these
are funneled to corporations and metropolitan areas that can shape
industry operations. In fact, [**[Diné scholar Melanie K. Yazzie found
that as landowners, Tribal Nations actually lose bargaining power
against transnational energy corporations over
time]{.underline}**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26879576?mag=renewable-energy-and-settler-colonialism).
Moreover, the constraints of being unable to participate on the
international stage erode Tribal sovereignty, [leaving Tribes unable to
shape energy policy and trade]{.underline}.

This dissertation [examines **[Indigenous land rights]{.mark}** in the
[Republic of Sakha]{.mark} (Yakutia),]{.underline} the largest and one
of the most resource-rich regions of Russia. The [historical and ongoing
[expansion]{.mark} of [extractive industries]{.mark} continues to
**[profoundly affect]{.mark}** the [lives of **Indigenous communities**
in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. One such community is Syuldyukar, a
small village located within Sadynsky nasleg in western Sakha---an area
that is traditionally the land of the Evenki people. Over time,
[[resource expansion]{.mark} altered Syuldyukar's social and economic
life, leaving [lasting marks on land-based
traditions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This study draws on a multi-method
approach, incorporating legal analysis, archival research, ethnography,
and oral history. It begins with an in-depth examination of the concept
of osvoenie, which I argue is crucial for understanding Indigenous-state
relations in Russia. [[Osvoenie]{.mark}, often translated from [Russian
as 'mastery of land]{.mark},' has played a central role in shaping state
approaches to land and people in Siberia. Initially tied to the
[**colonial ambitions** of the Russian Empire]{.mark} and later reframed
as [**modernization** under the Soviet regime]{.mark},]{.underline}
osvoenie has long served to [[legitimize territorial expansion and
resource control]{.underline}]{.mark}. Within this framework, the
concept of [**'[land use]{.mark}**']{.underline} (polzovanie zemlyoi)
operates as a [key [legal instrument for
dispossession]{.mark}]{.underline}. This dissertation traces the
[historical and political entanglement between land use and Indigenous
land rights, showing how land use continues to facilitate dispossession
in the present]{.underline}. One of the central findings of the research
is how [land use enabled the Russian state to develop distinct policies
toward Indigenous nomadic communities]{.underline}. The ethnographic
component focuses on Syuldyukar, examining the impact of osvoenie and
resource extraction on the community, including the historical loss of
territory and the decline of reindeer herding. It also explores local
hunting practices and their associated rights. From the perspective of
state bureaucracy, hunting---now the community's only remaining
traditional practice after the collapse of reindeer husbandry---is
considered the sole economic activity that qualifies for corporate
compensation related to resource extraction. Overall, the project
illuminates the entanglement of Indigenous land rights, the historical
genealogy of land use in Russia, and the contemporary challenges faced
by Indigenous communities in the Arctic.

Inuit are increasingly being considered within the realm [of Arctic
shipping governance. How the industry impacts the marine environment and
subsequently their subsistence diet, and how their traditional
knowledge can inform governance are often key pieces of these
conversations]{.underline}. But [Inuit are more than simply a
stakeholder]{.mark} in the context of Arctic shipping; they are
[Indigenous rights-holders and their relationship with the bodies that
govern the [shipping industry today]{.mark} are plag[ued with a history
of colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}. The need for reconciliation within
the broader Inuit-Crown relationship is sometimes cited, but rarely
further discussed in this context. In this chapter, the intent is to
centre reconciliation, and more specifically, decolonization:

'[[Decolonizing' is]{.mark} a social and political process aimed at
resist[ing and undoing the multi-faceted impacts of colonization and
re-establishing strong contemporary Indigenous Peoples, Nations, and
institutions based on traditional values, philosophies, and knowledge
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

A decolonizing mindset requires people to consciously and critically
question the legitimacy of the colonizer and reflect on the ways we have
been influenced by colonialism. According to expert in Indigenous
research methodologies Margaret Kovach, the purpose of decolonization is
to create space in everyday life, research, academia, and society for an
Indigenous perspective without its being neglected, shunted aside,
mocked, or
dismissed.[^1^](https://brill.com/edcollchap-oa/book/9789004508576/BP000018.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOooPchqTt9p8fMvAOYPNOVeLDX1VVGCpwveSdc7Ba395qduiQYDq#FN180001)

The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (RCAP), the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), and the National Inquiry into
Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (the National Inquiry)
all emphasize 'relationships' as a central piece of moving forward
together in a positive way. The latter, in particular, emphasizes the
need to look at not only the structural and institutional relationships
between Indigenous peoples and the Crown, but the way those play out in
the lives of individuals through what the National Inquiry refers to as
'encounters.'[^2^](https://brill.com/edcollchap-oa/book/9789004508576/BP000018.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOooPchqTt9p8fMvAOYPNOVeLDX1VVGCpwveSdc7Ba395qduiQYDq#FN180002)Relationship-building
requires human interactions, or encounters, which means there must be
compassion for the multigenerational experiences and intergenerational
traumas of Indigenous peoples. Such compassion is not possible unless
there is an understanding of the true histories and realities of Inuit
and the
Inuit-Crown relationship.[^3^](https://brill.com/edcollchap-oa/book/9789004508576/BP000018.xml?language=en&srsltid=AfmBOooPchqTt9p8fMvAOYPNOVeLDX1VVGCpwveSdc7Ba395qduiQYDq#FN180003) Therefore,
this chapter begins by drawing attention to some of the ways that
[[ships were involved]{.mark} in key events [over]{.mark} the course of
the [history]{.mark} of the Inuit-Crown relationship]{.underline} before
moving into a description of how Inuit have (or have not) participated
in the governance of shipping in their waters over this same period of
time. In the spirit of moving forward in a better way together, this
chapter closes with a discussion of some of the ways that the
Inuit-Crown relationship appears to be shifting, and identifies key
areas of focus for further decolonizing shipping governance in Canada
and the Inuit-Crown and Inuit-settler relationship more broadly.

### 2NC \-\-- Impact \-\-- Climate Change 

#### US presence and development in the Arctic causes and worsens massive climate problems, upholds structures of inequality, drives unsustainable expansion and exploitation of the native communities, all for the purpose of resource development.

**Moeser**, Elizabeth. 21 Feb. 20**23**, Bachelor of Science in
Environmental Studies at the University of Southern California, Master
of Science in Sustainable Development from Trinity College Dublin for
thesis, used a decolonization framework to analyze natural resource
development in the US Arctic. Now is a Education Specialist at the

An estimated 10 percent of the nearly four million residents throughout
the entire Arctic region are Indigenous.^1)^ Indigenous populations have
inhabited much of the Arctic for thousands of years, long before the
land was claimed and divided into nation-states. Interest in
opportunities for natural resource extraction drove the historic
colonization in the Arctic^2)^ [and, today, the [increasing
accessibility of minerals and oil due to climate change is
fuelling]{.mark} the so-called "Arctic resource
boom]{.underline}"3)---[[a quest to find and exploit]{.mark} the
[region's]{.mark} remaining [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} As [more
international players hope to participate in Arctic affairs, it is
critical to not only consider how these ventures impact Indigenous
populations but to prioritize decolonization in these
spaces.]{.underline}

[[Climate change]{.mark} is occurring more [rapid]{.mark}ly [in the
Arctic]{.mark} than in any other part of the world]{.underline}, with
the [[most recent evidence point]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} a [rate of
warming]{.mark} nearly [four times]{.mark} greater than [the global
average]{.mark}]{.underline}.^4)^ This [[warming is]{.mark} driving the
thawing of permafrost, loss of seasonal snow cover, and melting of sea
ice, ice caps and glaciers; each, in turn, [increasing the accessibility
of natural resources and growing global interest in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}^5)^ This article uses a decolonization
framework to analyze resource development with a focus on the United
States (US), which is considered an Arctic state by way of Alaska.
[Decolonization will be defined as a concept and practice of confronting
and reversing the historic and ongoing legacies of colonialism,^6)^
including the structures of power that uphold inequalities.]{.underline}

After a brief background covering land ownership and some of the
outcomes of resource development in Alaska, this article will delve into
dynamics that reproduce and perpetuate colonial structures of power.
This analysis will feature (i) the prioritization of state and federal
interests through the idea of sovereignty and (ii) the primacy and
assumed superiority of Western knowledge and conventions and,
conversely, the disregard for Indigenous knowledge systems and
worldviews. To bridge the gap between theory and action, the article
will continually ask what it would mean to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic. Confronting the ongoing systems and
dynamics of colonialism must be placed at the forefront of present-day
and future Arctic engagement and collaboration---not only in the US, but
throughout the region.

**Background**

[The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867. Just over a century later, in 1968, the discovery of oil
in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national
scale.]{.underline}^7)^ The commercial export of oil to the lower 48
states was now possible for the first time. [Hindering this ambition,
however, was the fact that the planned pipeline to carry the oil south
traversed lands claimed by Alaska Native populations.]{.underline}
'Alaska Native' refers collectively to the Indigenous populations who
have lived in present-day Alaska for thousands of years before the
arrival of Europeans in the 1700s.^8)^ This term encompasses "many
nations and tribes" and "widely diverse cultures, languages, lifeways,
art forms and histories".^9)^ [[To enable the construction of the
pipeline to the contiguous United States, land claims issues]{.mark}
around Prudhoe Bay were [settled with the Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act]{.mark} (ANCSA) in 1971. ANCSA extinguished Indigenous
claims to nearly 400 million acres of land throughout the state in
exchange for \$962.5 million and ownership of 43.7 million
acres]{.underline}.

ANCSA also divided the state into twelve regions, each with an Alaska
Native Regional Corporation. The regional boundaries of the corporations
do not, however, equate to land ownership; [land in Alaska is
predominantly owned by the state and federal governments. [Just 10
percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles]{.mark} are [owned by Alaska
Native population]{.mark}s.]{.underline}^10)^ [The Regional
[Corporations operate under US corporate law to administer resources and
serve the local communities.]{.mark} These for-profit corporations
participate in the Alaskan natural resource industry, both directly and
indirectly.]{.underline}

[[Federal Arctic policy in the US has tended to emphasize the
exploitation of Arctic resources for US economic
development]{.mark}.]{.underline}^11)^ Within the new *National Strategy
for the Arctic Region* (released October 2022), [economic development
continues to receive a strong emphasis]{.underline}---alongside
security---and Arctic investments are expected to increase over the
following decade.^12)^ [In the face of this ever-growing interest in
Arctic engagement, Alaska Native communities may face new and renewed
colonial intrusion in the form of large-scale resource
development.]{.underline}^13)^

**Effects of resource development**

[Continual 'boom and bust' with periods of financial growth and decline
characterizes resource development in the capitalist system.^14)^ This
instability prohibits many communities from relying solely on economies
centered on resource extraction]{.underline}. Subsistence practices
provide a source of greater stability within what would otherwise be an
unstable extractive economy.^15)^ [[Resource extraction]{.mark} has,
however, had [detrimental]{.mark} impacts [on the land, water, and
wildlife that reduce the viability of subsistence lifeways.
Specifically, extractive activities have been found to increase
vulnerability to biological invasion]{.mark},]{.underline}^16)^ [bring
changes to the land with built infrastructure,^17)^ and
[introduce]{.mark} the [risk of contamination, such as oil
spills.]{.mark}^18)^ The [resulting decrease]{.mark}d viability
[of]{.mark} [subsistence practices is worsened by]{.mark} the [threat
climate change poses]{.mark} to hunting and gathering
activities.^19)^]{.underline}

Although some measures of physical health have improved since
ANCSA,^20)^ [[resource extraction can compromise the health and
wellbeing of nearby Indigenous populations]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Significant health disparities remain among Alaska Natives compared to
non-native Alaskans and other US residents]{.underline}. [Generally,
Alaska Natives have a lower life expectancy, increased risk of
cardiovascular disease, and an elevated burden of infectious
disease.]{.underline}^21)^ [By exacerbating food insecurity, the
negative impacts of resource development may contribute to and worsen
health outcomes. Many of these [disparities]{.mark} are [rooted
in]{.mark} the history of [colonialism and socio-political
marginalization]{.mark}]{.underline}; in addition, their persistence
today may be attributed to the disproportionate exposure to
environmental health hazards.^22)^ Moreover, some researchers have found
that health data fails to produce a holistic picture of well-being,
suggesting that there must be a greater consideration for
context-specific understandings of health status.^23)^

Importantly, the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives. Instead, various facets of identity among individuals
and communities impact how they relate to extractive activities.
Socioeconomic class divisions,^24)^ gender identity,^25)^ one's location
in a rural versus urban setting,^26)^ and many other factors can all
impact how resource development is experienced. The complexity of the
relationship between resource development and Indigenous populations,
and the diversity within the Alaska Native population, must not be
ignored or simplified.

### 2NC \-\-- Impact \-\-- Genocide 

#### Colonialism causes cultural genocide - erasing Indigenous cultures through assimilation and forced forgetting.

(National Park Service, 9/13/2022, "Greenland's Military Possibilities

https://www.nps.gov/articles/negotiating-identity.htm)

[A mere 15 years after the War of 1812 concluded, President Andrew
Jackson introduced [the Indian Removal Act of 1830]{.mark}. When the law
passed, [it gave the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [the green
light to]{.mark} formally and [legally remove tribal communities]{.mark}
under "western law." Before this, no such sweeping law sanctioned by the
federal government existed, with compromise and treaties the only
available solutions. [Losing Indian lands resulted in]{.mark} a
**[loss]{.mark}** **[of cultural identity]{.mark}**, as [tribes relied
on their homelands as]{.mark} the place of [ancestral burial locations
and sacred sites]{.mark} where religious ceremonies were performed.
Without their lands, nations lost their identities, and their purpose.
[This]{.mark} loss of identity [corresponded]{.mark} [with the rise of
American hegemony]{.mark}, felt in every facet of tribal communities
following the War of 1812. [Native lang]{.mark}uages slowly [gave way to
English]{.mark}. [Mandatory American boarding schools forbade native
lang]{.mark}uages to be spoken. [Children, **alienated**]{.mark} from
their families, [began to lose their lang]{.mark}uages [and]{.mark}
their c[ulture]{.mark}s during their stay at these institutions. [Unable
to perform]{.mark} ceremonies and traditions [in native tongues]{.mark},
a slow [loss of]{.mark} tradition and [identity became
inevitable]{.mark}. In the Odawa community at Little Traverse, the famed
missionary Frederic [Baraga]{.mark} carried out his work preaching and
baptizing community members, and building Catholic churches from 1831 to
1833. Immediately upon his arrival, Baraga built a large fire in the
center of Little Traverse. He [demanded]{.mark} that [those]{.mark} who
were [serious about converting to the Catholic faith burn their sacred
bundles]{.mark}. Some Odawa did, other protested against changing their
faith system. But this erosion of religious freedoms was common: it
wasn't until 1978, under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, that
tribal people could freely practice their traditional beliefs. [To avoid
removal, "uncivilized"]{.mark} tribal [communities showed "progress" by
becoming Christian]{.mark}: changing their appearance, attending western
schools, and abandoning traditional hunting practices in favor of
farming]{.underline}. Odawa men were pressured to cut their hair and
discontinue the practice of tattooing, while social pressures influenced
Odawa women to wear American clothes and not traditional dress. [[Before
the War]{.mark} of 1812, [tribes had]{.mark} the [freedom]{.mark} to
dress [as they chose, speak their language, practice]{.mark} their
[religion]{.mark}, and access sacred sites and cultural resources
related to the geographic landscapes of their ancestors. [After the
War]{.mark} of 1812, the [changes were swift and
drastic]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the love of home prompted many tribes
to change only their outward identity to conform with American pressures
for assimilation, while in secret continuing traditional beliefs and
practices. A testament to this tenacity to tradition, despite pressures
to abandon it, is seen in the contemporary community's retention of
traditional values and beliefs. Ancestors' willingness to risk their
lives and their freedom to practice traditional beliefs allows
contemporary communities to hold on to and celebrate those practices.

[The Indigenous Peoples All of this geopolitical/geoeconomical theatre
is played on the **[ancestral lands]{.mark}** of the various [indigenous
populations]{.mark} that [populate]{.mark} the remote regions of the
[Arctic Circle]{.mark}]{.underline}. [On the circumpolar areas of
Scandinavia]{.underline}, [the **[Sámi peoples]{.mark}** have had
[millenia]{.mark} of lived genealogy [in the region]{.mark}, and
[**centuries of oppression** faced]{.mark}]{.underline}; [the
expansionist States have long compromised on the inherent rights and
interests of the indigenous minorities [in pursuit of maximising
territory and resource extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. [From [forced
relocation to ethnic cleansings]{.mark}, the lived genealogy of
indigenous Arctic nations is [marred with **generational
trauma**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the [current state of the Arctic
region as a hotbed of new resources]{.mark} and waterways [further
compromises their already weak position]{.mark} as an interest
group]{.underline}. [Increases in extractive and infrastructure
activities "\...undermine the recognition of Indigenous territorial
rights and traditional land-use..."]{.underline} (Hanaček, 2022) and
"\...continue to maintain patterns of colonial past." (ibid.) Common
ancestral lands are replaced at a fascinating rate, while environmental
concerns seem to be more and more justified with each passing day.
[Indigenous people are at the epicentre of most resource/commodity
frontiers in the region]{.underline} (ibid.) and thus become the primary
actors contesting expansionism and commodification of the land. The
Arctic circle meshes environmentalism, predatory capitalism,
corporatism, international law, geopolitical disputes, and grassroots
fight against totality in a fascinating manner. This thesis will attempt
to contextualise the numerous commodity/geopolitical frontiers of the
region, assess the [struggle of [Indigenous populations against the
machine of **capitalism**]{.mark} wielded by the State
actors]{.underline}, and attempt to synthesise philosophy of resistance
with current geopolitical and legal affairs to outline a way forward for
the Indigenous peoples and their struggle for self-determination.
Theoretical Framework and Methodology To find an [operable [definition
of sovereignty]{.mark} for the 21st century [through the understanding
of Sámi genealogical history of oppression]{.mark} and its contemporary
parallels and correspondingly]{.underline}, the post-structuralist
philosophies of resistance, rigorous qualitative research needs to be
conducted. This research is designed through the integration of
historical analysis, legal analysis, case studies and philosophical
inquiry - consequently, these are the three main chapters of the thesis.
Qualitative desk research is chiefly the method of inquiry within this
topic. Data collection is carried out through literature review and case
study analysis. Within the first chapter, the [[historical analysis of
the plight of the Sámi]{.underline}]{.mark}, a comprehensive literature
review of existing scholarly articles on historical oppression of the
Sámi, [contemporary [research]{.mark} articles [into the impact of
climate change and reterritorialisation on the
Sámi]{.mark}]{.underline}, research collected inside book collections
with an overarching theme of the Sámi in context of the Scandinavian
nation-states, and legal texts related to indigenous rights and
sovereignty. Within the second chapter, literature in the form of legal
documents, international treaties and court cases serves as a backbone
for legal analysis; the legal review is supplied by scholarly articles
from the fields of international law and international law on the
developments of sovereignty, as well as further [research into the role
of the Sámi within the legal developments of the nation-state apparatus
in Scandinavia]{.underline}. Within the third chapter, the chief
resource for literature review are primary and secondary sources of
Deleuze's philosophy; while the body of philosophical analysis is mostly
comprised of 1988's A Thousand Plateaus, supplementary scholarly
discussion on the book is utilised frequently. Furthermore, literature
within this chapter also involves [legal documents particular to Sámi
resistance to land-grab within Sápmi]{.underline}. Finally, [[historical
accounts of **Sámi resistance** to flagrant violations of their
land-rights]{.underline}]{.mark} will be consulted in developing a line
of argumentation. The interpretation of data is done through a
comparative analysis based on thematic similarities across various
fields. Given the interdisciplinarity of the topic and a broad nature of
the research question, this analysis is carried out continuously and
develops throughout the thesis, rather than being centralised into the
thesis' conclusion. Synthesising insights from literature review, case
studies and general philosophical inquiry will entail applying
post-structuralist concepts to the qualitative data gathered and
developing coherent definitions for the crucial topics of the thesis.
[Ultimately, these [new definitions]{.mark} will lead to an [enhanced
understanding of the indigenous plight]{.mark} as well as to a [more
inclusive approach to resistance]{.mark} that connects the material
reality with the imaginary reality of philosophical
inquiry]{.underline}. A qualitative desk-research's biggest limitation
is, naturally, an interpretative nature of a comparative analysis as
well as the volume of research and quality of sources consulted. Another
are the temporal constraints of the topic at hand, which plays out in
geopolitical theatre and thus is prone to rapid change. Despite rigorous
effort to maintain neutrality, the nature of desk analysis lends itself
to certain elements of subjectivity - interpretation of sources that
themself can be limited in size or scope and subjective conclusions
potentially impact the applicability of findings.

### 1NC \-\-- Alt \-\-- Decol 

#### The alternative is to decolonize the Arctic.

**Moeser**, Elizabeth. 21 Feb. 20**23**, Bachelor of Science in
Environmental Studies at the University of Southern California, Master
of Science in Sustainable Development from Trinity College Dublin for
thesis, used a decolonization framework to analyze natural resource
development in the US Arctic. Now is a Education Specialist at the

Analysis of Resource Development in the US Arctic." *The Arctic

www.thearcticinstitute.org/decolonization-arctic-engagement-critical-analysis-resource-development-us-arctic/.AKC

[To decolonize resource development, Alaska Native populations must have
greater control over the process. In other words, [one]{.mark}
overarching [aim of decolonization in practice is Indigenous
sovereignty.]{.mark} [However, (neo)colonial narratives shape and are
ingrained within the traditional concept of state-centered
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within this concept, the aims of the
government are continually prioritized; a hierarchy is established
whereby the interests and concerns of the state are given primacy.^27)^
This dynamic is one of the reasons why, in the case of Alaska and Alaska
Native populations, [[resource development]{.mark} continues to [be
experienced as a colonial enterprise]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The
[gains from extractive activities do not]{.mark} necessarily or
primarily [benefit Alaska Native populations]{.mark},^28)^ and the
interests of outside actors are prioritized]{.underline}.^29)^
Oftentimes, wealth from resource development has been extracted from
northern regions to benefit other populations.^30)^ An evaluation of the
Red Dog Mine in northwest Alaska, for instance, found that the local
population received a relatively modest share of benefits in terms of
employment, income, and mobility.^31)^

[As established through ANCSA, the [Regional Corporations are the
primary route for Alaska Native]{.mark} participation in [governing
resource development in]{.mark} the US [Arctic]{.mark}. These
[corporations]{.mark}, however, [operate under US corporate law
and]{.mark}, therefore, [within the frameworks of the capitalist
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. Participation through the structure of the
Regional Corporations, thus, limits the opportunity for Alaska Native
populations to achieve self-determination outside of those conventions.
In action, considering the embeddedness of the corporations within the
capitalist and colonial dynamics of the state, decolonization may
necessitate enhancing the power of and regard for local governments
rather than governing resource development principally through the
Regional Corporations.

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[A [deep-rooted colonial mentality that remains pervasive is the]{.mark}
assumed [supremacy of a Western knowledge system]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This creates a paternalistic relationship wherein decisions are made by
external 'experts' and imposed upon the Indigenous population. In short,
Indigenous ways of knowing are undermined.]{.underline}^32)^ The term
Indigenous knowledge is defined as "the understandings, skills and
philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction
with their natural surroundings".^33)^ [[Efforts to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic must not only embrace these different
worldviews, perspectives, and knowledge systems, but put them
first]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[There is also a tendency to assume that the only route to achieving
greater material benefits or power is to adopt a capitalist economy.
What Aníbal Quijano---one of the preeminent thinkers of decolonization
theory---terms 'cultural Europeanisation,' but can be understood as
colonial Western society more broadly, is taken as universal and
synonymous with being 'developed']{.underline}.^34)^ Before ANCSA was
passed in 1971, Alaska Native populations had primarily engaged in
subsistence activities. Since the settlement of land claims agreements,
Alaska Native populations are increasingly entrenched in the capitalist
economy, especially via resource development. [Today, most Indigenous
people in Alaska engage in a mixed economy, meaning a combination of
both subsistence and market-based activities.^35)^ A desire to obtain
the benefits from natural resource extraction on Indigenous lands is a
primary reason for this growth in capitalist
engagement.]{.underline}^36)^ [Through a decolonization lens, it is
understood that following the rhetoric and logic of Western society is a
way to "reach the same material benefits and the same power as the
Europeans: viz, to conquer nature in short for 'development'".^37)^ This
model of development, however, has proven "environmentally calamitous on
the global scale",^38)^ made even more dire by the rapid impact of
climate change throughout the Arctic.]{.underline}

Conceptualizing Indigenous sovereignty

[[Notions of Indigenous sovereignty are connected to the right to
self-determination]{.mark}. Decolonization must seek the
conceptualization and expression of Indigenous sovereignty outside of
the western hegemony and enduring colonial structures;
self-determination and sovereignty are limited when they can only be
articulated within the existing capitalist order.]{.underline}^39)^ [Dr.
Melanie K. [Yazzie presents the idea of anti-capitalist decolonization
to challenge the "hegemonic formation of 'extractivism' and its liberal,
capitalist, heteropatriarchal, and settler colonial valance of
development".^40)^]{.mark} This approach to decolonization seems
especially well suited to the Alaskan context as it critiques how
resource development is carried out in a capitalist system, instead of
presenting resource extraction as something inherently at odds with
indigeneity.]{.underline} [Indigenous sovereignty is reliant on the
ability of communities to have autonomy over their resources and
decision-making, as they have for thousands of years]{.underline}.^41)^
[An anti-capitalist approach to decolonization offers a way to center
Indigenous epistemologies and enable economic, societal, cultural, and
political pathways conceptualized and implemented by Alaska Native
people themselves]{.underline}.

The ideas presented throughout this article are applicable well beyond
the US Arctic, and beyond the realm of resource development. Interest in
exploiting natural resources drove historic colonization throughout the
entire Arctic region and the lingering structures and systems of power
continue to shape Indigenous lives and limit the capacity of communities
and individuals to mold their own destinies. [Therefore, [interrogating
and confronting]{.mark} the [ongoing systems and dynamics of colonialism
must be prioritized]{.mark} with[in Arctic engagement]{.mark} and
collaboration going forward]{.underline}. In light of the new *National
Strategy for the Arctic Region*---which differs, in one way, from the
prior 2013 edition in making no mention of oil or gas^42)^---there is a
need for further research and analysis to identify the implications of
this new strategy on efforts to decolonize and achieve Indigenous
sovereignty. [[There is]{.mark} also [a need to center and privilege
Indigenous voices in this space and, as such, future research must be
informed and conceptualized by and for Arctic Indigenous
populations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indigenous Peoples"

The category of Permanent Participants is a unique model of including
Indigenous Peoples in decision-making. It was created to provide Arctic
Indigenous Peoples with the means of active participation and full
consultation in the Council's deliberations. [[The Arctic Council is the
**only** international body that has accredited Indigenous]{.mark}
Peoples this [status]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this article Permanent
Participants reflect on the importance of the Council for them -- and
vice versa. [In general, the engagement by Arctic
Indigenous]{.underline} Peoples in the Arctic Council is guided by the
understanding that healthy and productive ecosystems, both on land and
in marine environments, are fundamental to the cultures, identities, and
livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous Peoples. These cultures rely on local
food sources and traditional materials to maintain health, safety, and
well-being. Indigenous Knowledge has been generated and passed down for
generations, ensuring a balanced relationship with the surroundings and
the environment. However, climate change, pollution, land use changes,
and encroachments are altering natural landscapes and threatening
Indigenous ways of life[. [The Arctic Council is important,
as]{.underline}]{.mark} [our [homelands and matters]{.mark} related to
these lands and waters [are on the Arctic Council agenda.]{.mark} [The
Permanent Participants are at the Arctic Council table to address the
challenges]{.mark} the Arctic Indigenous Peoples are facing [and
**amplify** the voice]{.mark}s of Arctic Indigenous Peoples. [Since the
first gathering]{.mark} of Arctic Indigenous Peoples in Copenhagen [in
1973]{.mark}, [coop]{.mark}eration [among Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples
[across the]{.mark} circumpolar [region has **evolved significantly**.
From]{.mark} early efforts to unify Indigenous Peoples' voices in
[addressing shared concerns to achieving formal recognition]{.mark} in
international cooperation, the journey has been marked by both
challenges and accomplishments. At the heart of this progress is the
Arctic Council, [an]{.mark} [intergovernmental forum]{.mark} that has
[provided Arctic Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples [with **a seat at the
table**]{.mark} to shape policies affecting their lands, cultures, and
ways of life]{.underline}. The first Arctic Indigenous Peoples' meeting
in 1973 laid the foundation for organized cooperation among Indigenous
Peoples across national borders. The participants envisioned a
collective body to advocate for their rights and interests. Their
declaration emphasized the need to protect their lands, resources, and
cultural heritage for future generations. Indigenous Peoples' leaders at
the time understood that environmental protection and Indigenous
self-determination were inseparable. This realization would later shape
the direction of Arctic cooperation, culminating in Indigenous Peoples'
participation in environmental and geopolitical discussions on the
global stage. The Arctic Council, established in 1996, built on the
foundation of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy and emerged
as the most significant institutional recognition of Indigenous Peoples
voices in Arctic governance. [[Unlike other intergovernmental
organizations, the Arctic Council includes Indigenous Peoples'
Organizations as Permanent Participants,]{.mark} granting them a
stronger role than Observer States and institutions. [This **unique**
structure allows]{.mark} Indigenous Peoples
[rep]{.mark}re[s]{.mark}entatives [to influence policy recommendations
directly, even if they]{.mark} [do n]{.mark}o[t]{.mark} [hold formal
voting rights]{.mark}. At its inception, [the]{.mark} Arctic
[Council]{.mark} included [three]{.mark} [P]{.mark}ermanent
[P]{.mark}articipants: the Inuit Circumpolar Council ([ICC)]{.mark}, the
[Saami Council]{.mark}, and the Russian Association of Indigenous
Peoples of the North ([RAIPON]{.mark}). [Soon after]{.mark}, the Aleut
International Association ([AIA]{.mark}), the Gwich'in Council
International ([GCI),]{.mark} and the Arctic Athabaskan Council
([AAC]{.mark}) [also joined]{.mark}, [ensuring broader
representation]{.mark} of Indigenous Peoples [across the]{.mark} Arctic
[region]{.mark}]{.underline}. If we hold hands, we cover the whole
Arctic Circle. The Arctic Council has become an essential forum for
Indigenous Peoples advocacy, allowing Indigenous knowledge to be
utilized in scientific research, environmental protection efforts, and
sustainable development initiatives. As one Indigenous leader put it,
the presence of Permanent Participants ensures that the Arctic Council
is not solely focused on environmental concerns like polar bears but
also on the people who live and thrive in the Arctic. [[During its
Chairship]{.mark} of the Arctic Council [from 2023 to]{.mark}
20[25]{.mark}, [Norway]{.mark} has [made]{.mark} [efforts to restart
Arctic cooperation following a pause in official meetings]{.mark} of the
Arctic Council initiated by seven Arctic States [in Feb]{.mark}ruary
20[22]{.mark}. By focusing on non-political but critical issues such as
wildfires, Norway has managed to keep the Council functioning.
Additionally, [Norway]{.mark} has [maintained dialogue]{.mark} with the
Indigenous Peoples Organisations, [ensuring that all six]{.mark}
Permanent [Participants **remain engaged**]{.mark} in discussions about
the Council's future. [As Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples [continue to
navigate]{.mark} the [challenges posed by c]{.mark}limate
[c]{.mark}hange, resource development, and geopolitical tensions, [their
voices]{.mark} must [remain at the centre of Arctic
governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} The evolution of Indigenous cooperation
in the Arctic, from the 1973 meeting in Copenhagen to their status as
Permanent Participants in the Arctic Council, highlights the resilience
and determination of leaders of Indigenous Peoples. The Arctic Council
has provided a foundation for this engagement and remains a crucial
platform for advocating for Indigenous Peoples' rights, environmental
protection, and sustainable development, but further steps are necessary
to solidify their role. By strengthening Indigenous Peoples'
representation, the Arctic Council can continue to serve as a model for
inclusive and effective governance in the Arctic and beyond.

This upcoming Thanksgiving, there is one thing we should all be
discussing at our dinner tables this year -- Land Back. [[Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} in the United States [have been]{.mark} very [clear that
the **key to decolonization is returning land**]{.mark} to the
Indigenous communities from which it was stolen. Returning land and
respecting the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples **provides significant
restitution** **for** the hundreds of **broken treaties** and the
countless human rights violations]{.underline} committed by the United
States of America. The movement, [Land Back, also promotes making the
world a healthier and safer place. The motivation for
[**decolonization** should **focus on**]{.mark} the [benefits to
Indigenous peoples and]{.mark} the **[restoration]{.mark} of
justice**]{.underline}. At the same time, Land Back is an excellent
environmental policy. As if we needed another reason to support the
sovereignty of Indigenous peoples in the United States, now you can add
combatting climate change and improving human health to the myriad of
reasons Indigenous communities should be central to environmental
decision making.

In deciding if I should write this piece I wondered if I was the right
person to be speaking on this topic, since I am not an Indigenous
person. However, I was born on land that historically belonged to the
Wampanoag Nation and was fortunate enough to be taught the truth about
what happened when the Pilgrim settlers arrived in Plymouth and had
their first Thanksgiving, also known as the National Day of Mourning by
many Indigenous peoples. My mom's family is originally from Ireland and
my father's is from Iran, meaning I have spent much of my life learning
about the devastating consequences of colonization. Now as an adult
working in the fields of environmental law and policy, I continuously
look for ways to support decolonization. One thing that I have found to
be [[**essential** to]{.underline}]{.mark} my own [[**work** is
**promoting** **Indigenous rights in environmental law** and
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last summer, I worked at the Native
Hawaiian Legal Corporation helping to protect Native Hawaiian rights and
ultimately work towards keeping Hawaiian land in Hawaiian hands. The
experience was invaluable and inspires me to share with other
environmentalists why Indigenous peoples are fundamental to the
environmental movement, and how returning land is a critical
conservation strategy.

Increasingly, the world is recognizing the role of Indigenous peoples in
"sustainably using and managing natural resources", however, [there
is]{.underline} still a [lack of support for Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline}. Despite this, [[**Indigenous management of
lands is** proving **essential in**]{.mark} ensuring governments are
able to meet **[environmental goals]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Indigenous lands see]{.mark} less deforestation and smaller wildfires,
[preserved biodiversity]{.mark}, reduced invasive species, and greater
protection of water resources]{.underline}. This provides vital benefits
to human health, and [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has already
seen the positive effects of returning land]{.mark} to Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} in California, Maine, Virginia, and Minnesota.
[[Indigenous]{.mark} nations have a fundamentally unique [relationship
with the environment]{.mark} and thousands of years of experience,
[making them successful in preserving ecosystems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This unique relationship is preserved in the creation stories of
Indigenous peoples. A common feature in over 300 versions of creation
stories is the idea that human beings and the land itself are family.
Indigenous peoples see the environment as kin to be protected and cared
for. In the Kumulipo, the Kānaka Maoli's creation story, the first
Hawaiian, Hāloa, is the younger brother to a stillborn baby. When the
elder son was buried, the Kalo plant sprouted from the ground. This
plant is sacred to the Kānaka Maoli because it is a part of their
genealogy. This summer, I had the opportunity to witness first-hand what
caring for the Kalo looks like. It is this incredibly special connection
to the environment that creates a standard of care that cannot be
reproduced by anyone who fails to adopt the familial relationship. This
reason, among many, make the Indigenous peoples such excellent stewards
in sustainable development.

[There are [several methods that could be used]{.mark} to return land to
Indigenous peoples, [including acts of Congress]{.mark} using its
plenary power, [buy-back programs]{.mark} where the government buys land
back from willing sellers at fair market value, [or]{.mark} even
[judicial rulings]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[honoring]{.mark}** the
**[treaties]{.mark}** the United States has
**[broken]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In addition, the general public must
be addressed. Too often, the public claims that land back is impossible
and will lead to negative outcomes, often describing the exact
experiences suffered by the Indigenous peoples when settlers arrived in
America. However, this assertion does not align with the reality we have
seen when Indigenous sovereignty has been restored.

**[[Indigenous lands account for]{.underline}]{.mark}** only 24% of
Earth's landmass, but are home to **[[80% of Earth's
biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, sequestering 20% of the world's
carbon. [[The environmental services provided to the world by Indigenous
land are invaluable]{.underline}]{.mark}, and yet, "one-third of the
rural poor and 15% of the world's extreme poor are Indigenous." The
effects of climate change are detrimental to the way of life of
Indigenous populations in the United States, despite the fact that
Indigenous populations are least likely to contribute to climate change.
