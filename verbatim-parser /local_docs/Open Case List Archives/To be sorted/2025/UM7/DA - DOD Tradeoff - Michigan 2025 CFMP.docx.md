This month, multiple media sources reported that the US Air Force had
initiated ground tests for its Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)
program, marking a significant milestone before the anticipated maiden
flights of Anduril's YFQ-44A and General Atomics' YFQ-42A drones this
summer.

The tests, focusing on propulsion, avionics, autonomy integration and
ground control interfaces, aim to validate performance and prepare both
unmanned fighters, designated under the "fighter drone" FQ series, for
operational use.

Anduril's YFQ-44A, known as Fury, features advanced design elements,
including stealth-optimized intake shapes and potential infrared sensors
for enhanced situational awareness. General Atomics leverages its
experience with unmanned platforms such as the XQ-67A to advance the
YFQ-42A, aimed at expanding the operational role of unmanned systems.

Beale Air Force Base in California was selected to host the new Aircraft
Readiness Unit, tasked with maintaining drones ready for global
deployment at reduced personnel requirements due to their
semi-autonomous nature.

[The US [Air Force **expects**]{.mark} a competitive production
[decision in fiscal 2026]{.mark}, aiming for affordability at
approximately US\$25-30 million per drone.]{.underline}

[The initiative represents [a]{.mark}n essential component of the US Air
Force's broader [strategy to **integrate unmanned
systems**]{.mark}]{.underline} alongside manned fighters like the F-35,
enhancing combat effectiveness and operational readiness in contested
environments.

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED \>\>

Mark Gunzinger mentions in a January 2024 Air & Space Forces Magazine
article that CCAs can be decoys, jammers and strike
platforms---stimulating adversary defenses, complicating targeting and
absorbing fire to reduce crewed aircraft attrition.He notes that some
variants will be launched from dispersed sites, avoiding reliance on
fixed airfields and enhancing flexibility while complementing, not
replacing, fifth-generation fighters.Considering possible adversary
advantages, the US Department of Defense's (DOD) 2024 China Military
Power Report (CMPR) mentions that China has a robust and redundant
Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) covering land areas and extending
up to 300 nautical miles from its coastline.The report notes this system
integrates a vast early-warning radar network, advanced fighter aircraft
and diverse Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) platforms, including the
indigenous CSA-9 (HQ-9) and its enhanced version HQ-9B. These operate
alongside the Russia-supplied SA-10 (S-300PMU), SA-20 (S-300PMU1/PMU2)
and the advanced SA-21 (S-400) Triumf, noted for their longer range and
superior radar systems.It also states that China's People's Liberation
Army Air Force (PLAAF) deploys Airborne Early Warning and Control
(AEW&C) aircraft, extending radar coverage beyond ground radar
limitations.In addition to layered air defenses, the report says the
PLAAF and PLA Naval Aviation operate the world's third-largest aviation
force with 3,150 aircraft, including 1,900 fighters. China currently
produces jets at a 1.2:1 ratio over the US.Despite the "affordable mass"
promised by CCAs, Rohith Stambamkadi mentions in a February 2025 article
for the Institute for Security & Development Policy (ISDP) that as
drones rely on data from sensors and predefined algorithms, they have
limited flexibility as they lack real-time adaptability for air
superiority.Stambamkadi argues that drones suffer from range, speed and
payload limitations, undermining the notion that they can achieve air
superiority independently.He argues that combat experience in Ukraine
and Israel has shown that drones alone cannot replace manned aircraft,
with the former's air defenses effectively thwarting mass drone attacks
from Russia and Hamas enemies.

He adds that [[stealthy systems that]{.mark} can **[survive]{.mark} in
an anti-access/area denial** [(A2/AD)]{.mark} environment]{.underline},
such as the B-21 bomber, will remain critical, as a force vulnerable to
attrition may not retain sufficient mass to remain effective.

[Regarding how [the US would deploy **CCAs in**]{.mark} **a
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait crisis**, Admiral Samuel Paparo mentions in a
June 2024 article in the Washington Post that he intends to [turn the
place into an "**unmanned hellscape**]{.mark}" to buy time for US forces
to get ready for an intervention.]{.underline}

While Paparo did not discuss the details of the strategy, Bob Work
mentions in a July 2024 USNI article that it involves thousands of
[pre-positioned [**sea, air and ground drones** in]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait operating in tandem [to eliminate]{.mark} the
"tyranny of [distance]{.mark}"]{.underline} that characterizes
operations in the Pacific theater.

[The [Defense]{.mark} Department is bolstering its engagement [in the

strategy that I introduced at the Halifax international security forum
last November.

**[tradeoff]{.mark}s** in capabilities]{.underline}, as well. That\'s

Body

The War of 2026 scenario and various wargames paint a dire picture of
the way [[a]{.mark} violent [struggle for Taiwan]{.mark} would **[likely
unfold]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While much is unclear, this fight will
likely incur terrible costs in blood and treasure. Therefore, [the [only
way to win]{.mark} the fight for Taiwan [is to **deter it**]{.mark}
**from ever happening**. [Nuclear]{.mark} deterrence [is
**insufficient**]{.mark}, but [unmanned systems]{.mark} could
**[disrupt]{.mark}** the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) [plans for
Taiwan]{.mark} reunification [and deter]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hinese
[C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty [from]{.mark} ever issuing [the
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Though [U.S. military [unmanned systems have
**n**]{.mark}**o[t]{.mark} yet demonstrated** the capability to
meaningfully [shape]{.mark} a battle for [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline},
progress has been made with the Replicator Initiative, a "big bet" aimed
at purchasing unmanned systems while galvanizing the U.S. industrial
base. [The Navy and Marine Corps [must]{.mark} organize to receive,
test, **[proliferate]{.mark}**, and reveal [unmanned
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} if Replicator is to become deterrence.

Deterrence: What Kind and What Means

Nuclear deterrence, as Navy Commander Daniel Post wrote in a 2023
Proceedings article, requires that adversaries are vulnerable to
punishment, uncertain of their ability to control escalation, wary of
the exceptional character of nuclear weapons, and rational actors and
have been communicated the consequences of their undesirable actions
sufficiently. Today, the problem lies with the second condition. [Malign
[actors]{.mark} have grown **[accustom]{.mark}ed** [to gray zone
warfare]{.mark} within a U.S.-dominated security environment
[and]{.mark} believe **they can [control
escalation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Commander Post himself concedes that
"nuclear deterrence operations are capable of deterring activities only
at the higher end of the spectrum of conflict," meaning that nuclear
deterrence deters only nuclear war.

If nuclear deterrence is not the answer, retired U.S. Navy Admiral James
Stavridis offers an alternative concept of theater deterrence, defined
as a localized set of capabilities that constitute "sufficient combat
power within a particular geographic theater" that halt the enemy's
intent to conduct hostile operations. Theater deterrence causes an enemy
to question whether his or her particular action will achieve the ends
he or she thinks it will. Theater deterrence is specific, localized, and
precise.

Employment of emerging technologies as a deterrence vector is not a new
idea. In a 1988 Proceedings article, Navy Commander Robert Shields Jr.
pointed out that technological development was outpacing the military
acquisition system and battlefield relevance. Following Stavridis'
theory of theater deterrence, increasingly sophisticated weapons should
be developed to outflank a particular adversary capability and moved
into the theater prior to the start of hostilities.

Antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) is, in essence, the PLA's technological
and organizational answer to the capabilities that enabled U.S. Navy sea
control in 1996, when the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group last sailed
through the Taiwan Strait. A2/AD is China's theater deterrence. To
undermine Chinese A2/AD capabilities, the United States must be capable
of reestablishing local sea control and extend theater deterrence
through 2026. Admiral Stavridis would advocate coalition building,
improved technology, and paradigm-shifting tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTPs). Unmanned systems lie at the intersection of those
three ingredients.

Pros and Cons of Drones

Retired Navy Captain Sam Tangredi would likely agree that nuclear
deterrence will not be enough to deter war with China but that emerging
technologies with associated TTPs will. The thesis of his prize-winning
2024 Proceedings essay, "Replicate Ordnance, Not Cheap Drones," is that
drones are not the correct technology. He has two main arguments against
unmanned systems.

First, China "is the very source of many of the cheap components needed
for low-cost 'replication,'" is a sound concern. The supply chain for
drone components today is vulnerable to exploitation. However, the
Pentagon's Replicator initiative, headed by Deputy Secretary of Defense
Kathleen Hicks, has two goals. One is to create an inventory of
multisized, multidomain, attritable and non-attritable unmanned systems.
The other is to galvanize the U.S.-based defense industrial base.

Tangredi's other argument is that, although UAS and USVs have created
tactical advantages in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, "They have not had
strategic effect." This is incorrect. [Using
[drones]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Magura v5---domestically
produced small USVs---Ukraine [h[as]{.underline}]{.mark} [functionally
imposed **[sea denial]{.mark}** on the vastly superior Black Sea Fleet
with little navy to speak of]{.underline}. Open-source reporting notes
that the Russian Navy is increasingly unwilling to send Kalibr-capable
surface combatants out of Sevastopol. Black Sea Fleet stagnancy in
Sevastopal has created opportunities for more traditional targeting and
further Russian losses. Though the Black Sea and the Taiwan Strait have
important differences, [unmanned systems [have been]{.mark} a
**[game-changing]{.mark} technology** [in every war]{.mark} in which
they have played a part]{.underline}. Tangredi's
alternative---mass-producing existing munitions to bolster magazine
depth in preparation for major conflict---is also essential. Both must
be done.

What Drones Could Do

Within the 2026 scenario framework, Retired Captain Scott Tait and
Commander Anthony LaPova, U.S. Navy, [describe [a **two-phased
approach**]{.mark} to gaining sea control after initial PLAN aggression:
[**rollback** and]{.mark} shifting from **defense to
[offense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their description of rollback from east
to west, presumably all the way back to Mainland China, is ambiguous:
"Rollback would require a large number of ships and weapons and support
from other Navy warfare communities, the joint force, and allies, all
with well-practiced, robust, and resilient command and control (C2) and
interoperability on a scale not seen at sea since the 1945 Battle of
Okinawa." However, [even with perfect C2 and interoperability, such a
rollback **[without]{.mark} [unmanned systems]{.mark}** will likely
[cost thousands of]{.mark} U.S. sailors their
[lives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Tait and LaPova give unmanned systems their due, though, pointing out
that "[[uncrewed systems]{.mark} of all sizes would **[swarm]{.mark} in
[the air]{.mark}**, on the [surface]{.mark}, and [undersea]{.mark}. They
would [provide **intelligence** ]{.mark}**and [targeting]{.mark}**,
[deceive and overwhelm]{.mark} enemy [sensors, attack]{.mark} PLAN
[ships and submarines]{.mark}, and mine port entrances.]{.underline}"
Captain Tangredi similarly points out two tasks for [unmanned
systems]{.underline} in the face of an invasion: [overwhelming PLAN
defenses [with]{.mark} high numbers of [small kinetic drones]{.mark} and
providing communication relays for a variety of circuits.]{.underline}

Retired Navy Admiral Sandy Winnefeld has written many times about the
importance of mine warfare, including his War of 2026 scenario piece
"[[Mine Warfare]{.underline}]{.mark} Could be Key." One of Winnefeld's
recommendations---adding jet propulsion to Quickstrike-Extended Range
mine kits (500- and 1000-pound general purpose bombs converted to
shallow water mines) for more airdrop options---[may be
**[infeasible]{.mark}**]{.underline} within the next two years because
of sluggishness in the acquisition process. But [small USVs with
substantial loiter capabilities could achieve several of the effects
Winnefeld identifies as decisive]{.underline}. A loitering USV or
unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) is not so different from a mine, it
turns out.

The only limits to unmanned systems mission concepts are a warfighter's
imagination and ability to iterate. Unmanned systems iterations and
operations should be easier to approve than similar ones using manned
platforms. [[Unmanned]{.mark} [systems are]{.mark} more
**[expendable]{.mark}**]{.underline} than any human and therefore
commanders should be more willing to accept risk to systems during
experimentation in the United States and operations overseas. There are,
however, [[concerns about adversary recovery]{.mark} of uncrewed
systems]{.underline} and their sensitive payloads. [Outfitting drones
with a kinetic or [a]{.mark} software-based **[antitampering
device]{.mark}** would be a simple [solution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED \>\>

Perhaps the joint force should attempt an overseas exercise in which
multidomain uncrewed systems are employed in a synchronized and layered
fashion, giving peer adversaries an idea of the chaos and confusion the
United States can create using the capabilities Replicator will lead to.
However, there is an important distinction between technological
experimentation and exercise. Trying to do both at the same time
diminishes the potential outcomes of each. Once the technology is in the
hands of sailors and Marines and they have iterated it into an
employable capability, overseas exercises would provide an opportunity
to demonstrate it for the sake of deterrence. Regardless of how and when
they are revealed to the enemy, rehearsing unmanned systems concepts and
executing unmanned systems operations will accelerate the ability to
scale unmanned systems for the day deterrence fails. Task Organize and
Iterate Unmanned systems concepts become unmanned systems capabilities
only once they have been demonstrated in representative environments
with representative, and ideally decentralized, C2. The best way for the
Sea Services to accelerate its unmanned systems capability is to hand
resources and mission-type orders to E-5s and let them run. After all,
many of the yet-to-be validated unmanned systems capabilities that could
undermine A2/AD and make unmanned systems survivable in degraded
communications environments---distributed man-in-the-loop or
man-outside-the-loop control and automatic target recognition---require
tremendous trust in relatively junior service members. The Navy has
already acknowledged the imperative to task organize against unmanned
systems by establishing the Robotics Warfare Specialist rating. These
sailors will presumably fill the ranks of Unmanned Surface Vessel
Division One (USVDiv-1) and USVDiv-3 in the surface navy and Unmanned
Undersea Vessel Squadron One (UUVRon-1) in the submarine force. Once
these sailors begin arriving for duty, commanders must think about risk
differently and delegate responsibility more aggressively than is
customary on a sea-going capital vessel. Naval Special Warfare (NSW) has
begun establishing dedicated unmanned systems maneuver elements. There
are unmanned systems concepts suited uniquely for special operations
forces---particularly those where unmanned systems are controlled from
denied areas or uses exquisite payloads---but, for now, unmanned systems
afford an opportunity for NSW to dedicate horsepower to a common problem
and drive integration with the fleet. The Marine Corps (particularly
Marine Corps Forces, Pacific) must establish dedicated unmanned systems
elements of their own. As Marine Lieutenant Colonel Brian Kerg wrote in
2023, putting III Marine Expeditionary Force in a fighting stance means
deciding how it will fight ahead of conflict. In addition to eventual
deployments by USVDivs and NSW, the 3d Littoral Combat Regiment and 5th
Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company should establish dedicated unmanned
systems formations whose task and purpose are experimentation and
exercise with unmanned systems in the IndoPaCom theater; prepositioning
of hardware, logistics, and sustainment; and proliferation of unmanned
systems knowledge among key allies and partners. Major Michael McHugh,
U.S. Marine Corps, advocates integrating explosive USVs into littoral
combat teams as a fires platform. He is on the right track, but unmanned
systems are not yet mature enough to be employed by the same fires
elements that will employ High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and
Naval Strike Missiles. For a long time, unmanned systems was considered
a collateral duty. This must change. The Crisis Has Arrived

[The [stakes **could not be higher** for]{.mark} deterring war with
China]{.underline}. Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote, "The wise or unwise
action of individual men has at certain periods had a great modifying

version of the status quo that the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty has [plan]{.mark}ned against for decades would be
unwise.]{.underline} As the Replicator tranches are funded, roll out,
and mature, the Sea Services must already be organized to receive
systems, test them, break them, develop associated tactics, techniques,
and procedures, and deploy them overseas for "reveal" operations.
[[We]{.mark} are on the right track, but we [must

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the event of [a US-China war over
**[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [there are plausible scenarios in
which either [**China** or the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would]{.mark} logically
[consider]{.mark} using **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear
weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a limited fashion, given the high
stakes. Limited nuclear use is defined as a nuclear attack short of a
large-scale nuclear exchange designed to eliminate a large fraction of
an adversary state's military forces, industrial production, or
population. This section will lay out the plausible scenarios for either
side's deliberate nuclear use across the spectrum of employment---from
signaling to an attack on an operationally relevant target to an
extended nuclear exchange.

Scenarios for Chinese Limited Nuclear First Use

There are at least four scenarios for Chinese limited nuclear first use
in a conflict with the United States over Taiwan: nuclear signaling and
threats, a nuclear demonstration with no military effect, a nuclear
attack on Taiwan, or a nuclear attack on the forces or territory of the
United States or one or more of its regional allies.

Some might respond that these scenarios are implausible, given China's
pledge not to use nuclear weapons first in a conflict, but [there are
reasons to **doubt** China's **stated policy**]{.underline}. In fact,
[[China's]{.mark} nuclear [strategy]{.mark} plausibly
**[permits]{.mark}** a variety of **[nuc]{.mark}lear
use[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the country unequivocally possesses
the capability to conduct a nuclear first strike. Moreover, US
statements and [[documents **cast doubt** on]{.mark} China's
**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst-**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se
[policy]{.underline}.20 In addition, [[policy can **change** in]{.mark}
the midst of [a **crisis**]{.mark} or conflict]{.underline}, [and [there
is]{.mark}]{.underline} technically [[nothing about]{.underline}]{.mark}
China's nuclear **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommand [[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol [[that]{.mark} would [prohibit **first
use**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States must plan against this
possibility.

Signaling

In a crisis or a conflict over Taiwan, [Chinese [leadership might
use]{.mark} **nuclear [signaling]{.mark}** [to stop]{.mark} or limit a
**US [intervention]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This signaling could take a
variety of forms. [Chinese leadership or state media could issue
threats]{.underline}---vague or specific, public or private---[that warn
of]{.underline} "**[catastrophic consequences]{.underline}**" for the
United States if it interfered with Chinese "internal matters." [The
Chinese military could visibly **alert** its nuclear
forces]{.underline}, including by dispatching mobile missiles from
garrison, dispersing bombers to different airfields, and perhaps even
releasing warheads from central storage to operational units. [China
could also **test** its nuclear **delivery vehicles**]{.underline}. This
could be through a routine test like an intercontinental ballistic
missile (ICBM) launch in its western test ranges. China could perhaps
also test a new capability, like its August 2021 test of a boost-glide
hypersonic missile with fractional orbital bombardment capability, which
reportedly took US defense officials by surprise and was "very close" to
a "Sputnik moment" in the words of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gen. Mark Milley.21 Perhaps interpreting Russian nuclear threats against
Ukraine as successful in dissuading direct US and NATO intervention,
China could believe that raising the salience of nuclear weapons would
deter the United States and its allies from joining the war on Taiwan's
side.

Demonstration

The Chinese military could conduct a nuclear demonstration. It could
take a step up from nuclear signaling by actually detonating a nuclear
device without having direct military effects. The least provocative
demonstration would be a test at an existing Chinese test range. China
has not conducted a nuclear weapons test since its 1996 signature of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which it has not ratified. The purpose of
such a test would aim to convince Taiwanese, US, and allied governments
and publics of China's seriousness about the conflict and its
willingness to escalate to nuclear use. A more provocative nuclear
demonstration could occur above the waters surrounding Taiwan or perhaps
even above international waters in the vicinity of a US military base in
the Western Pacific.

Nuclear Attack on Taiwan

[A **nuclear [attack]{.mark}** [against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}
itself [could [target]{.mark} Taiwanese [**military** or
**leadership**]{.mark} facilities]{.underline}---possibly before the
United States has committed troops to Taiwan's defense---[[as a
**gambit**]{.mark} to collapse Taiwan's defenses]{.underline},
[decapitate its leadership]{.underline}, [and deter]{.underline} the
United States and its [allies from supporting Taiwan]{.underline}. In
recent years, experts have recommended that Taiwan transform its
military into a distributed force capable of a "porcupine defense" less
vulnerable to air and missile bombardment. Still, [there are significant
[Taiwanese]{.mark} **military [facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (air
bases, ports, and army bases) [or naval vessels that might [present
**attractive targets**]{.mark} for a nuclear attack]{.underline}. The
Chinese military could use nuclear weapons to strike some of these
facilities with minimal collateral damage to the Taiwanese populace or
economy. By contrast, [[China could also consider a
**decapitating**]{.mark} **nuclear [strike]{.mark}** against Taiwanese
national leadership in Taipei]{.underline} or against Taiwanese
continuity-of-government locations. The goal of these attacks would be,
first, to collapse Taiwanese government and, second, to signal to the
Taiwanese population and the wider world that China is willing to
escalate to the highest levels to achieve its goal of conquering Taiwan.
A strike against an urban center would bring especially grave diplomatic
and reputational repercussions for China and damage the postwar value of
Taiwan to Beijing.

In either instance, a nuclear strike could be carried out before the
United States or other countries had committed forces to the conflict,
presenting those nations with the difficult choice of declaring war on a
China that had already demonstrated its willingness to use nuclear
weapons to prevail.

Nuclear Attack on US Forces, Allies, or Territory

Territory China could use nuclear weapons against US or allied forces or
territory if it judged that nuclear use could confer a significant
advantage.

[If the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies
and partners [did decide to **come to the aid** of Taiwan with military
force]{.underline}, [[China could]{.mark} elect to [use
**nuc**]{.mark}]{.underline}lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a
limited way [[against US]{.mark} or allied **[forces]{.mark}**, US
military **[facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the territory of allies
engaged in the fight, [[or]{.mark} even US
**[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Targets for nuclear use could
include US or allied forces in the region, such as US carrier strike
groups or surface action groups. A Chinese response might also include
attacks on US military facilities located on the territory of allies,
such as Kadena Air Base located on Okinawa, Japan. Finally, such a
strike could target US military facilities on US territory, most notably
Andersen Air Force Base (AFB) on Guam. Even if the United States or its
allies had not yet declared their intent to support Taiwan against a
Chinese invasion with military force, [Chinese [leadership
could]{.mark}]{.underline} still decide that such intervention was
likely and decide to [[engage in **nuclear use**
early]{.underline}]{.mark}, [motivated by the possibility of
significantly **reducing** the **capacity**]{.underline} of the United
States or its allies [to intervene in the conflict]{.underline}. Nuclear
use before a declaration of war could possibly be more useful to China
if US or allied forces were not yet alerted or dispersed.

In addition to this warfighting logic, [a Chinese
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline} to use nuclear weapons against US forces
[[could be motivated by]{.mark} a desire to **avoid
defeat**]{.underline}: If Chinese leadership believed that it was losing
a conventional war over Taiwan, it might seek to escalate to nuclear use
in hopes of compelling negotiations for a settlement---[a similar logic
to]{.underline} the Russian
"**[[escalate-to-de-escalate]{.underline}]{.mark}**" strategy.22

Additionally, it is possible (though, of these possibilities, least
likely), that Chinese leadership might believe, due to escalation in a
conventional war, that US nuclear use may be likely and imminent. In
that scenario, the CCP could decide that a preemptive, large-scale
nuclear strike on the US homeland is necessary. This seems especially
unlikely given the ultimate escalatory nature of this action and the
reality that China does not---and will very likely not for the next five
to ten years---possess a strategic force capable of a successful
counterforce strike on the US nuclear triad. The United States will
likely retain a robust second-strike capability in that time period.
Such an attack, therefore, would likely result in a destructive
retaliatory strike on the Chinese homeland---Chinese leadership is
unlikely to take that risk.

In sum, if Beijing decided to invade Taiwan, China could possibly engage
in nuclear threats or use to deter outside intervention; compel Taiwan
to surrender; defeat Taiwanese, US, or allied forces; or force
negotiations if the Chinese conventional offensive was on the brink of
collapse.

Scenarios for US Limited Nuclear First Use

The United States might choose to use nuclear weapons in the event of a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan---especially if a Chinese victory looked
imminent or if China engaged in a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US
homeland. US declaratory policy does not rule out nuclear first use.23
This policy assures allies and partners that the United States would
consider using nuclear weapons to deter or respond to a strategic
attack. Further, it forces a potential adversary not to count out US
nuclear weapons if it aggressed against a US ally or partner. The United
States has previously identified conditions for nuclear first use as a
response to aggression. During the Cold War, the United States relied on
nuclear deterrence to backstop local defenses, including prescribing
that nuclear weapons be "available for use as other conventional
munitions" in the event of hostilities.24 US strategists planned for
nuclear first use in the event of a Soviet invasion of West Germany, a
situation not dissimilar to the potential local conventional inferiority
the United States may soon be facing in the Taiwan Strait. It is not
outside the realm of possibility that US strategists today could adapt
plans like those for the specific political and physical geography of
the contemporary Western Pacific, alongside greater investment in
conventional defense and closer collaboration with allies.25

[The [likeliest scenarios for **US**]{.mark} **nuclear [first
use]{.mark}**]{.underline} during a Chinese invasion of Taiwan [[would
be an attack]{.mark} directly [against the]{.mark} Chinese [invasion
force]{.mark} in the face of a **Taiwanese defeat** [or as]{.mark}
[**retaliation** for]{.mark}]{.underline} a large-scale [nonnuclear
strategic [attack on the]{.mark} US **[homeland]{.mark}**
or]{.underline} that of its **[allies]{.underline}**.

The United States could find itself in a scenario in which the president
decides to use nuclear weapons because he or she seeks to prevent the
success of a Chinese invasion but lacks the conventional forces to do
so. This situation could come about for a variety of reasons, including
an intelligence failure that does not provide warning of a Chinese
buildup, a successful Chinese conventional preemptive strike on key US
conventional forces in the region, or a failure by the United States to
invest in sufficient conventional forces to defend Taiwan. In this case,
the United States would seek to use nuclear weapons against the invasion
force to frustrate the immediate success of the attack and to provide
time for reinforcements or give room for diplomacy.

The United States might also seek to use nuclear weapons to deter or
respond to a nonnuclear strategic attack on the US homeland or nuclear
command and control. The 2022 National Defense Strategy
"\[r\]ecogniz\[es\] growing kinetic and non-kinetic threats to the
United States' homeland from our strategic competitors."26 China can
likely conduct kinetic or non-kinetic attacks on the United States.
These attacks could include disruptions of critical infrastructure
(e.g., the power grid or financial system), which might rise to the
level of "extreme circumstances" that threaten "the vital interests" of
the United States, as described in the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review.27 US
leaders might consider nuclear use to demonstrate to China that it
cannot expect to gain enduring advantage from these nonnuclear strategic
attacks on the US homeland or those of US allies and partners.

Scenarios for an Extended Nuclear Exchange

In the event that either the United States or China used a single
nuclear weapon or a handful of nuclear weapons in any of the scenarios
above, the prospect for an extended nuclear exchange would loom large.
Of course, a single nuclear detonation would not lead automatically to a
nuclear Armageddon. Chinese leadership could conceivably elect not to
respond to US nuclear use with nuclear weapons of its own---especially
if China seemed likely to prevail regardless. A US response to a Chinese
nuclear first use could also possibly convince Chinese leadership that
it had nothing to gain from further escalation. As in the Cold War,
strategists on both sides will identify pathways from one nuclear
battlefield use to a full nuclear exchange, so that knowledge may induce
caution for both parties.

[If a single nuc]{.underline}lear weapon [is used]{.underline}, [[it is
not hard to imagine how that could **escalate**]{.mark} to a strategic
**nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. The United States might use nuclear
weapons against Chinese landing ships. [China could retaliate by
striking **Andersen AFB** on Guam]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could strike **several airfields** on the Chinese
mainland]{.underline}. China could retaliate by using an ICBM against US
military bases in Alaska. [[Strategists]{.underline}]{.mark} on both
sides [would [start to]{.mark} seriously [contemplate]{.mark} the value
of a [**damage-limiting** strike]{.mark}]{.underline} as a broader
exchange begins to look inevitable. Indeed, [[given]{.mark} that [the
**number** of]{.mark} US [nuc]{.mark}]{.underline}lear weapon[[s]{.mark}
available for theater-based]{.underline}, [low-yield strikes [is **quite

As the Iraq problem persisted after the Gulf war, the threat from Iran
persists after Operation Midnight Hammer. The Trump administration can't
repeat the mistakes of 2003, occupying a country with no serious plan.
But it shouldn't repeat the mistake of 1991 either. [The
[Iran]{.mark}ian regime [will **remain a threat**]{.mark} to America
until different leaders occupy Tehran]{.underline}. If Mr. Trump leaves
the clerics in charge, the U.S. will eventually have to deal with an
even worse conflict---as it did in Iraq.

If Iran is left to its own devices, there is little possibility of a
domestic transformation. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
still lives, as do many leading officials. The assaults on American
positions in Qatar and Iraq are unlikely to be the end for a regime that
regularly pronounces "Death to America." [[The only way]{.mark} to
eliminate this threat [is to eliminate]{.mark} its ideological
source---[the regime]{.mark} led by Ali Khamenei.]{.underline}

Now is the perfect time to target Mr. Khamenei and thereby decapitate
the regime in Tehran. [[Airstrikes]{.mark} by Israel and the U.S. [have
done]{.mark} **serious [damage]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Israeli
action against the Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas, along with the Assad
regime's collapse, have also [[debilitated the Axis of
Resistance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Removing the supreme leader would set off a power struggle inside Iran.
Such a move is unlikely to lead to representative government, but that
shouldn't be the goal. [Mr. [Khamenei's absence
would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely elevate a military-led regime that
could be convinced---through an appeal to self-preservation---to
[[dismantle]{.mark} its [nuclear program]{.mark} and [end its proxy
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a plan would require coordination with
Israel. [[The U.S. should preposition military assets to **hunt down**
Iran's remaining ballistic missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} if Tehran's
reaction warrants it. The U.S. should ensure that European powers
reinstate sanctions on Iran. Finally, the U.S. should work with the Gulf
states, Israel and Turkey to create a policy for a post-Khamenei Iran
that could offer incentives for Tehran's good behavior.

Israeli intelligence says that the assassination of Iran\'s top nuclear
scientist in November set Iran\'s nuclear program back, and that it
would need two years to build a nuclear weapon. In the early 2000s, the
International Atomic Energy Agency discovered that Iran had been
cheating on the NPT with a clandestine program to enrich uranium. Under
the 2015 treaty negotiated by the Obama administration, Iran agreed to
radically slash its stockpile of uranium and limit the number of
centrifuges that it can use for enrichment. But since the Trump
administration pulled out of the deal in 2018 and hit Iran with new
sanctions[, Iran has **resumed production** of 20 percent enriched
uranium, getting nine-tenths of the way toward weapons-grade
fuel.]{.underline}

What happens [[if Iran goes nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}?

[[It would set off a **chain of**]{.mark} **[prolif]{.mark}eration**.
[Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}, Iran\'s enemy, [has **said it [would

Egypt]{.mark} could [follow]{.mark}]{.underline}. The threat from North
Korea, meanwhile, is alarming to Japan and South Korea, where factions
have argued for the development of their own nuclear weapons as
deterrents. Since it first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006, North Korea
has built dozens of bombs and hundreds of missiles, and it now has
intercontinental ballistic missiles that can reach anywhere ---
including the continental United States. Our allies are now wondering,
says Ivo Daalder of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, \"Will you
sacrifice us for you? Will you save Seattle at the price of Seoul?\"
[The more nuclear weapons there]{.underline} are in the world, of

The [**Air Force would cut its F-35A purchase for fiscal 2026 roughly

**[service typically buys about four]{.underline}** dozen
**[J]{.underline}**oint **[S]{.underline}**trike
**[F]{.underline}**ighter**[s each year]{.underline}**, with some years'
purchases topping 60. But a [budget document]{.underline} obtained by
Defense News shows the **[service would procure 24 F-35s next year, for
a cost of nearly \$4 billion.]{.underline}** That is [less than the 44
F-35s, costing \$4.8 billion, the Air Force is on track to buy this
year]{.underline}, and [the 51 jets worth \$5.5 billion the service
bought in 2024.]{.underline} And while the number of jets the Air Force
plans to buy would drop by 45% between 2025 and 2026, the **[savings
would lag far behind]{.underline}**. **[The cost of the F-35 purchases
in 2026 would drop less than 18% over the 2025 cost, suggesting
economies of scale would suffer]{.underline}** from the reduced buy. The
slow emergence of budget documents and administration spending plans in
this way is highly unusual, even for an administration in its first
months. Proposed budgets for the upcoming fiscal year are often released
formally sometime in the spring and accompanied by briefings explaining
the spending plans. But President Donald Trump's administration has not
rolled out its full budget proposal for fiscal 2026, though it has
trickled out broad outlines of spending plans. **[The House
Appropriations subcommittee on defense advanced Tuesday its own version
of a Defense Department spending bill that looks closer to a typical
F-35 purchasing plan.]{.underline}** That bill would provide [\$4.5
billion for the Air Force to buy 42 F-35As]{.underline}, as well as
another [\$1.9 billion for the Marine Corps to buy 13 short takeoff and
vertical landing F-35Bs.]{.underline} Another \$[2 billion was included
for the Navy and Marine Corps to buy the F-35C carrier
variant.]{.underline} While the [Air Force has sought to pare back some
F-35 purchases]{.underline} in recent years, primarily due to
dissatisfaction with delayed upgrades known as Technology Refresh 3, the
apparent **[plan to slash purchases to this degree would be a
surprise.]{.underline}** Top Air Force leaders have stressed
consistently that the [F-35 is the centerpiece]{.underline} of its
fighter fleet. Some have referred to it as [a "quarterback]{.underline}"
that uses advanced data sharing capabilities to tie together multiple
assets. **[The Air Force's fighter fleet is rapidly
aging]{.underline}**, and **[older F-15s and F-16s are
retiring.]{.underline}** Air Force leaders have often said [the service
needs to buy at least 72 fighters each year to modernize its aircraft
and bring down the average age of its fleet.]{.underline} Buying 24
F-35As, along with 21 F-15EX fighters also budgeted in the Pentagon's
plan, would leave the Air Force far short of that goal in 2026. The
**[Air Force's future budget plans, which it released last year,
included proposals to buy 42 F-35As in 2026, 47 apiece in 2027 and 2028,
and 48 in 2029. The service eventually wants to buy a total of 1,763
F-35As.]{.underline}** Doug Birkey, executive director for the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies, said in an interview that [cutting F-35
purchases this severely would be disastrous to the Air
Force]{.underline} and irrevocably set it further back in its effort to
modernize its fighter fleet. "There's no way the Air Force or the nation
can afford to bring down the fighter buy rate," Birkey told Defense
News. "The legacy \[fighter\] assets are rapidly failing due to age, and
we need 72 fighters per year just to tread water \... We will never
regain the time." A [reduction in F-35 purchases would also throw the
supplier base for the jet into disarray]{.underline}, Birkey said, not
just Lockheed Martin, but also the more than 1,900 other companies that
feed its supply chain. Without consistent targets to work toward every
year, the supplier base will get "[whiplashed around]{.underline}," he
said. "Everyone says we need to rebuild the defense industrial base, but
this is not how you do it," Birkey said. "The workforce, access to
long-lead supply --- everything that's required for maintaining the
ability to produce \[F-35s\] and surge \[when more production is
necessary\], you destroy it through cuts like this." Birkey said the
Pentagon is likely considering such drastic cuts due to rising expenses
that are squeezing its budget, but he expects [**Congress will
ultimately bring the F-35 buy rate back up to normal.** Trump has spoken
highly of the F-35]{.underline} and its stealth capabilities in the
past. Former Trump adviser Elon [Musk has been a prominent skeptic of
crewed fighters such as the F-35,]{.underline} [calling them "obsolete
in the age of drones."]{.underline} **[Musk has dramatically and
publicly fallen out of favor with the administration in recent weeks
amid his criticism of the president's signature spending
bill.]{.underline}** Lockheed Martin's stock dropped more than 6% after
news broke Wednesday of the possible purchase cut, although the company
has since pared back some of that loss. The Air Force did not respond to
a request for comment.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [deployed its most
advanced fighter aircraft, the F-35]{.underline}, [to the Philippines
for the first time,]{.underline} a move analysts say signals
Washington's intent [to stress-test forward combat readiness in a
region]{.underline} increasingly **[shaped by China]{.underline}**'s
maritime assertiveness. The arrival of the stealth jets for the [Cope
Thunder joint air drills]{.underline} -- launched on Monday at Clark Air
Base and running until July 18 -- reflects a **[more tangible form of
deterrence]{.underline}**, experts say, **[as the Philippines becomes
further integrated]{.underline}** into America's regional defence
network. More than 2,500 personnel -- including 2,300 from the
Philippine Air Force (PAF) and 225 from the US Pacific Air Forces -- are
taking part in the exercise, which focuses on bilateral fighter
integration and enhancing allied interoperability. Lieutenant Colonel
Bryan Mussler, commander of the US 421st Fighter Squadron, told
reporters the decision to deploy the F-35s was meant to deepen
collaboration with regional partners, adding: "A [free and open
Indo-Pacific is something that we enjoy but should not take for granted
in the future years if we want to continue to deter any form of
aggression."]{.underline} While the F-35 features cutting-edge
technology including state-of-the-art sensors, Mussler stressed the
exercise was about more than showcasing hardware. "**[The F-35 is the
cornerstone of the US forces and we have a strong relationship with the
PAF. We look forward to strengthening the alliance and continuing to
integrate]{.underline}**," he said. F-35s and the PAF's FA-50 aircraft
conducted a joint patrol over the West Philippine Sea -- Manila's name
for the part of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone
-- to mark the start of the drills. According to Tian Xia, a Hong
Kong-based international relations analyst, the deployment shows that
[Washington is no longer relying solely on symbolic
presence.]{.underline} He described the [F-35 as]{.underline} not just a
jet but "**[a flying command node]{.underline}**" -- capable of
[gathering and sharing real-time battlefield intelligence through
advanced sensors and data links]{.underline}, allowing it to coordinate
with other forces and direct operations across air, land and sea. "Its
deployment shows that **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates is [stress-testing forward combat
presence]{.underline}, and the Philippines is clearly part of that
operational map," he said. "This is **[Agile Combat Employment in
action]{.underline}**," Xia added, referring to the US Air Force
doctrine that emphasises rapidly dispersing forces across a network of
smaller, often improvised bases to complicate enemy targeting.
[Philippines as forward launch pad]{.underline} Arnaud Leveau, assistant
professor of geopolitics at Paris Dauphine University, said the
deployment confirmed the [Philippines' emerging role as a frontline
state in US contingency planning, particularly under]{.underline} the
Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement ([EDCA)]{.underline}, which
**[allowed rotational deployments and materiel pre-positioning at key
Philippine military sites.]{.underline}** In 2023, [Manila granted
access to four more EDCA locations]{.underline}, bringing the total [to
nine]{.underline} -- a move that, Leveau noted, **[positioned the
country as a launch pad for US operations in both the Taiwan Strait and
the South China Sea.]{.underline}** "This is not only about geography --
it's about shaping [an operational architecture that enables early,
flexible, and credible force deployment]{.underline} from multiple
vectors," he said. Leveau said the exercise was **[accelerating the
PAF's exposure to Nato-style coordination and joint
planning.]{.underline}** "It contributes to the emergence of a shared
operational culture, which is essential for any meaningful military
cooperation in a crisis scenario," he added. [Deploying F-35s to the
Philippines was also a significant evolution of US posture in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}, he said. "This is no longer a symbolic gesture; it's
an operational signal in the context of intensifying strategic rivalry
with China. By projecting its most advanced combat aircraft to a country
traditionally at the periphery of its regional architecture, **[the US
confirms a shift towards the southern flank of the South China
Sea."]{.underline}** Building capacity and trust Vincent Kyle Parada, a
former Philippine Navy defence analyst, said recent US F-35 deployments
to theatres including the Middle East and Indo-Pacific reflected a
growing emphasis on operational readiness. "We're not just talking about
exercises or signalling here but actual combat operations," Parada told
This Week in Asia. In the case of Cope Thunder, he added, "Washington
isn't just sending these platforms out as a message -- it's an active
effort to capacitate junior allies like the Philippines and integrate
them into a broader nodal defence network". Philippines vows major
exercises in coming Balikatan military drills with US Abdul Rahman
Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, said the [F-35
deployment reflected a "high level of strategic trust" between
Washington and Manila,]{.underline} given how cautiously the US shared
its most advanced military assets. He said the drills offered a chance
to test how US F-35s and the Philippines' FA-50s operated together,
while also [strengthening Manila's defence capabilities to "support the
US for a potential conflict in the South China Sea or
Taiwan".]{.underline} Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be
reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not
recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to
any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed
to supplying it with weapons. This month's iteration of the Cope Thunder
exercise is the second of the year, following April's joint drills
involving nearly 1,000 personnel and a deployment of F-16s -- the same
multirole jets Manila intends to acquire. "[We are testing our ability
to respond across domains by shaping scenarios that simulate contested
environments requiring flexibility, innovation and operational
depth,]{.underline}" Lieutenant General Arthur Cordura, chief of the
Philippine Air Force, said in his opening remarks. [China claims nearly
the entire South China Sea, including areas also claimed by the
Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam]{.underline}. An international
tribunal dismissed China's claims in 2016, declaring them without legal
basis -- a verdict that Beijing has consistently rejected. Manila and
the US are bound by the long-standing 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty that
calls on both sides to help each other in times of aggression by an
external power.

allies in the western Pacific, built massive artificial island bases in
the disputed Spratly Islands, and actively sought control over all the
waters, seabed, and airspace of the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. Yet the United States has
maintained its access to those waters, deterred any major Chinese use of
force against its neighbors, and helped support the efforts of Japan to
maintain administrative control over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the
East China Sea. [U.S. strategy has been notably less successful in
preventing China from robbing Southeast Asian partners, including U.S.
ally the Philippines, of their resources and rights in the South China
Sea. But the United States has at least slowed China's advance while
avoiding war.]{.underline} It would be **[unwise, however, to assume
that the status quo is stable]{.underline}**. Deterrence has not
failed---yet. China is unlikely to do something as brazen as forcefully
denying U.S. Navy or commercial ships access to the South China Sea,
attacking American or Japanese bases, or intentionally sinking Filipino
sailors in disputed waters. But **[Beijing continues to probe and test
U.S. and allied resolve, provoking low-level crises which could easily
escalate.]{.underline}** Current U.S. [strategic thinking could trigger
disproportionate responses that would cause such crises to spiral out of
control. **That is the way World War I began a century ago---and it
could happen again.** War games seem to confirm these]{.underline}
historic lessons. One of us has taken part in numerous simulations over
the last five years asking seasoned experts and officials to role-play
how [Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and American leaders might respond to
crises in the South and East China Seas.]{.underline} The results are
typically sobering. **[Some end in a rapid Chinese fait accompli, such
as the seizure of a disputed island with minimal cost, while U.S. and
allied leaders dither. This type of scenario would lead to considerable
damage to international norms, U.S. alliances, and American national
security.]{.underline}** Even **[more simulations rapidly escalate into
full-scale conflict]{.underline}**, bringing **[China and the United
States to the doorstep of nuclear war over stakes that no rational
observer would consider worth it.]{.underline}** The U.S. national
security community tends to view [the ability to defeat China (or
Russia) in combat wherever an ally might be attacked as an essential
goal]{.underline}. Direct defense or prompt reversal of any aggression,
no matter how small, are the foundational principles of current
strategy. [A]{.underline}rticle [5]{.underline} of the NATO treaty and
simi**[lar mutual defense commitments to Japan and the Philippines treat
all aggression as an equally existential threa]{.underline}**t. So in a
scenario involving a Chinese landing on the Japanese-administered
Senkakus or a threat to the Sierra Madre---a derelict Philippine navy
ship intentionally ran aground at Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratlys
and now housing a dozen soldiers---American strategic culture most often
leads to the conclusion that kinetic action to retake a seized feature
or outpost is justified to avoid abandoning an ally and damaging U.S.
credibility. But **[such an escalation]{.underline}**, while it should
be kept as an option, would be fraught. It might [**end quickly,**
amounting to little more than a skirmish, or large-scale conflict
between nuclear-armed superpowers could ensue. Both sides would **have
powerful political incentives to escalate further**]{.underline}.
Military warning and communications systems might be targeted through
cyberattack or other means in a way that sowed confusion. **[Escalation
control could not be guaranteed]{.underline}**---history and military
scholarship strongly suggest as much, and many war games corroborate it.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. President [Donald [Trump
wants]{.mark} a pay raise for troops and [more]{.mark} **high-tech
missiles and [drones]{.mark}** in next year\'s defense
budget]{.underline}, while cutting Navy jobs and buying fewer ships and
fighter jets, according to budget materials posted on Wednesday.

At \$892.6 billion, the defense and national security budget request for
fiscal 2026 is flat compared with this year.

The budget, which also includes nuclear weapons-related activities
carried out by the Department of Energy and increases funding for
homeland security, puts Trump\'s mark on the military by pulling funds
away from weaponry and services to fund his priorities. The Pentagon\'s
portion of the national security budget is \$848.3 billion.

[The White House said the funding will be used [to **deter
Chin**]{.mark}**ese [a]{.mark}ggression**]{.underline} in the
Indo-Pacific region, [[and]{.mark} [**revitalize** the]{.mark} U.S.

U.S. President Donald [[Trump\'s proposed]{.mark} defense
[budget]{.mark} for fiscal year 2026 **[prioritizes
drones]{.mark}**]{.underline} and long-range missile systems over
traditional air and naval platforms, Reuters reported on June 26.

The \$892.6 billion request maintains the overall funding level from
2025 but shifts spending toward innovation and high-tech systems. The
budget [[includes **increased investment**]{.mark} in small drones, a
response to their proven battlefield **value in
Ukraine[.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The proposal slashes procurement of key legacy systems. Trump\'s plan
includes just 47 F-35 fighter jets, down from the 68 planned by the
Biden administration, and only three warships.

The Pentagon will continue to purchase Joint Air to Surface Standoff
Missile -- Extended Range and Long Range Anti-Ship missiles for the U.S.
Air Force. Fewer Precision Strike Missiles, meant to replace the ATACMS,
are included in the main request.

The proposal also includes a 3.8% increase in military salaries, while
decommissioning aging and costly aircraft and ships. The Navy\'s
civilian workforce will be reduced by more than 7,000 employees to free
up resources for technology and modernization.

[The [shift]{.mark} from traditional fleet expansion indicates a move
[towards **asymmetric, precise warfare**]{.mark} with drones playing a
crucial battlefield role.]{.underline}

Ukraine\'s experience has informed several elements of the request.
Since Russia\'s full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has expanded drone
production across all domains --- air, land, and sea --- with plans to
manufacture 30,000 long-range drones in 2025.

[[Ukraine\'s **hybrid strike**]{.mark} **platforms**]{.underline}, such
as the Palianytsia and Peklo missile-drones, [have [draw]{.mark}n

[[The]{.mark} Pentagon's **[budget request]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
fiscal 2026 [[prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark} major near-term
investments in a wide variety of [[uncrewed]{.mark} [systems and]{.mark}
counter-[drone]{.mark} capabilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, senior
defense and military officials told reporters.

Detailed budget materials are being released on a rolling basis this
week, but the officials provided insights into the nearly \$1 trillion
spending plan in an off-camera press briefing Thursday morning.

"This budget is [[the **first year**]{.mark} that [we]{.mark} are
[call]{.mark}ing [out]{.mark}]{.underline} --- specifically --- our
[[autonomy line]{.mark} in its own section]{.underline}. So, it will be
[\$13.4 billion for autonomy and autonomous systems]{.underline}," a
senior defense official told DefenseScoop.

"For counter \[unmanned aerial systems\], [[the total request is **\$3.1
billion**]{.underline}]{.mark} across the services," they also
confirmed.

The new requests for additional drone and counter-drone funding come
[[as the U.S.]{.mark} military [confronts]{.mark} **serious
[challenges]{.mark}** [integrating]{.mark} and defending against the
rapidly evolving [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, which often cost much

By eliminating unnecessary policies and bureaucracy, the Defense
Department plans to put legions of small, inexpensive drones into the
hands of warfighters who need them. 

\"In line with President \[Donald J.\] Trump\'s recent executive order
to support the American drone industry, \[Defense\] Secretary \[Pete\]
[Hegseth signed a memo [**removing restrictive policies** on
drone]{.mark} innovation that hindered production and access to **vital

Sean Parnell during the Weekly Sitrep video. \"By leveraging our

we [[will]{.mark} help [power a **technological leapfrog**]{.mark} and
bolster the U.S. drone industry by approving hundreds of
**made-in-America drone products** for purchase by our
military]{.underline}.\" 

According to Hegseth, [the department\'s new focus on the use of drone
technology [involves]{.mark} **three primary efforts.**]{.underline}

[First is to strengthen the **U.S. drone [manufacturing]{.mark}**
base]{.underline}.

\"We will bolster the nascent U.S. drone manufacturing base by
[approving hundreds of American products for purchase by our

[Second is to get [the **best tools**]{.mark} America has to offer into

\"We will power a technological leapfrog, arming our combat units with a

and \[artificial intelligence\] experts,\" Hegseth said.

[The department will [also]{.mark} ensure]{.underline} those combat
units don\'t just have drones available to them, but [that they are also
**[well-train]{.mark}ed** on how to use them.]{.underline}

This would amount to about US\$300 billion (US\$300B), which has been

// SaMi🦋

One thing Democrats and Republicans agree on: the [[Trump]{.mark}
administration['s **delayed**]{.mark} **defense [budget]{.mark}** has
[left Congress]{.mark} to draft a massive bill on its own [with **little
clarity** on which]{.mark} national security [programs need
funding]{.mark} or how the Pentagon plans to spend the
money.]{.underline}

During a late-night House Rules Committee hearing Monday, lawmakers from
both parties criticized the administration for [[failing to
submit]{.mark} key documents -- such as **[justification books]{.mark}**
-- that typically accompany the president's annual budget request and
detail spending priorities.]{.underline}

Without them, members said, the fiscal year (FY) 2026 Department of
Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act was written largely in the dark.

"[This [bill was drafted]{.mark} under **unprecedented circumstances**
[without]{.mark} the benefit of [timely and complete]{.mark}
justification [materials]{.mark} that typically accompany the
President's budget request]{.underline}," said Rep. Ken Calvert,
R-Calif., who chairs the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED \>\>

Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., ranking member of the subcommittee, echoed
that concern, calling the situation "a huge problem." She emphasized the
complexity of the defense bill, noting that it "includes national
security programs that require constant oversight to determine the
proper allocation of funds." "We do that by reviewing the full budget
request," McCollum said. "Unfortunately, the Trump administration failed
to submit the congressional budget justification books before we marked
up this bill, and we still don't have all the books yet. "The DoD has,
for the most part, released the bulk of its FY2026 budget justification
books (J-books), although though several key documents remain pending.
Of the military services, the Army is the only one to publicly release a
full set of detailed J-books. The Air Force has released an overview,
while the Navy has only published a portion of its justification
materials. Falling in line with the Trump administration's FY2026
defense budget request --released late last month -- lawmakers
introduced an \$831.5 billion defense appropriations bill. President
Trump's FY 2026 national defense budget calls for \$1.01 trillion in
total funding --- an increase of 13 percent over the FY 2025 enacted
levels. Of that total, \$848.3 billion is allocated for the DoD's
discretionary budget, and \$113.3 billion will be provided through
mandatory reconciliation funding, totaling in \$961.6 billion. House
Defense Bill Includes Key Tech Provisions Despite bipartisan frustration
over the budget delay, divisions quickly resurfaced over key provisions
--- chief among them President Trump's Golden Dome missile defense
initiative aimed at countering ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile
threats. The bill includes \$13 billion for related missile defense and
space programs to support Golden Dome, with another \$25 billion in the
recent reconciliation spending measure earmarked for the project. The
administration estimates the full cost of Golden Dome at \$175 billion
and expects the systems to be operation by 2028. "When we talk about
Golden Dome, people tend to focus on the name ... instead of what we
actually have to do," said Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., who defended the
investment. "The weapon systems today are significantly faster than the
weapons that our current systems were built to defend us from." Rep.
Calvert added: "That's the reason why we're developing the Golden Dome
-- because the systems we have presently are not adequate to protect the
homeland." But Democrats remain unconvinced. "Golden Dome at this point
is merely a concept, not a plan," said McCollum. "None of us have been
briefed in detail on how the administration intends to spend \$175
billion or deliver \[the system\] in three years ... We don't know how
the money for Golden Dome will impact future defense bills." Meanwhile,
the bill mirrors the DoD's budget request by including a 3.8 percent
increase in basic pay for all military personnel, effective Jan. 1,
2026.

\<\< BREAKS CONTINUE \>\>

Though short on specifics, [[GOP lawmakers]{.mark} also [signaled
support for]{.mark} boosting **military [drone]{.mark}
u[s]{.mark}e.**]{.underline} The bill offers few details, but
[[hints]{.mark} at FY2026 funds [to **accelerate**]{.mark} **unmanned
system [acquisition]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- echoing a recent directive
from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after a June 6 executive order
prioritizing U.S. drone dominance.

"[Drones have changed the battlefield, both large drones and small
drones," said Calvert. "It's **no time for us to waste**."]{.underline}

#### Even with funding---[centralizing]{.underline} drone development requires [extra resources]{.underline} which is key to production.

"[While the [requirements]{.mark} between the two organizations [are

cooperation is critical]{.mark}** to fielding a capable and
cost-effective platform]{.underline}," lawmakers wrote in a report
accompanying the House Appropriations Committee's version of the 2026
defense spending bill.

While the report doesn't specify which programs the Air Force and SOCOM
should consider merging, [the Air Force last month contracted with
dronemaker General Atomics]{.underline} to design a stealthy, autonomous
aircraft dubbed "GHOST" that can fly ultra-long distances for
reconnaissance and strike missions.

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED \>\>

GHOST may become a next-generation option to replace mainstays of the
Air Force's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance enterprise
that are slated for retirement:The U-2 Dragon Lady spy plane, whose
pilots have captured photos of sensitive military sites since the
1950s.The RQ-4 Global Hawk, the long-endurance surveillance drone that
was set to take over the U-2 mission but is now being phased out.The
MQ-9 Reaper, the Air Force's workhorse hunter-killer drone that
redefined combat in the Global War on Terror.The Air Force Research
Laboratory is also exploring long-range drones through its ULTRA
project, short for Unmanned Long-Endurance Tactical Reconnaissance
Aircraft. The program has produced a drone that can fly for more than
three days straight while carrying over 400 pounds of surveillance
equipment. ULTRA, a commercial sport glider outfitted for military use
by DZYNE Technologies, was photographed on the flight line at Al Dhafra
Air Base in the United Arab Emirates last year.An Air Force spokesperson
told Air & Space Forces Magazine neither the service nor Air Force
Special Operations Command "have any background" on the House
provision.SOCOM operates its own shadowy long-endurance aircraft
program, comprised of the Air Force's MQ-9, the Army's MQ-1C Gray Eagle
drone, and an unmanned version of the Pipistrel Sinus powered glider.
The Long-Endurance Aircraft family of systems "employs relatively
low-cost, long-endurance unmanned aircraft operated in austere and
permissive environments" to provide intelligence to the special
operations community, SOCOM spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Kassie Collins said
in an email.In 2021, The War Zone reported the command had worked with
the Air Force Research Lab to convert Sinus aircraft into unmanned
aerial systems. The drones, operated by the Virginia-based technology
company TSC, offer a maximum endurance of over 40 hours in flight up to
17,000 feet, according to TSC's website.

option]{.mark} as we work with our military services and industry
partners [to identify **low-cost, high endurance**]{.mark} airborne
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}," the command told the publication at
the time.

SOCOM piggybacks on acquisition programs run by the services but also
pursues its own equipment as needed. In 2020, the command launched its
own search for an armed overwatch plane after the Air Force's nearly
three-year effort to procure a similar light attack aircraft ended short
of a full buy.

[Lawmakers also told the Air Force in that case to coordinate with SOCOM
on its light attack experiments while encouraging it to transfer some of
the project's funding to special operations]{.underline}. Air Force
Special Operations Command went on to buy a modified crop duster to
serve as the new OA-1K Skyraider II, envisioned to fly counterterror
missions in regions without advanced air defenses that could down the
plane.

Secretary of Defense Pete [[Hegseth]{.mark} issued a new directive
Thursday [aimed at **shaking up**]{.mark} the Pentagon's procurement
system and **[quickly]{.mark}** ramping up its arsenal of unmanned
aerial systems.]{.underline}

The memo "[[Unleashing]{.mark} U.S. Military [Drone
Dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}," addressed to senior Pentagon
leadership, combatant commanders and directors of defense agencies,
[referred to uncrewed systems as "[the **biggest battlefield**]{.mark}
innovation [in a generation]{.mark}]{.underline}."

"Our adversaries collectively produce millions of cheap drones each
year. While global military drone production skyrocketed over the last
three years, the previous administration deployed red tape. U.S. units
are not outfitted with the lethal small drones the modern battlefield
requires," Hegseth wrote.

[The directive [calls for approving]{.mark} "[hundreds]{.mark}" of
American products for purchase by the U.S. military, arming combat units
with a variety [of]{.mark} "**[low-cost drones]{.mark}** made by
America's world-leading engineers and AI experts," [and]{.mark} more
widely [integrating]{.mark} UAS into training
[exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here are some key deadlines that the SecDef laid out for Pentagon
leaders:

[**[No later than Sept. 1]{.mark},** the Army]{.underline}, Navy, Marine
Corps and Air Force [must establish "deliberately screened, active-duty
experimental formations purpose-built to enable rapid scaling of small
UAS across the Joint Force]{.underline} by 2026, prioritizing initial
fielding to U.S. lndo-Pacific Command units," per the memo. "[[Within 30
days]{.mark}, the [O]{.mark}ffice of [S]{.mark}trategic [C]{.mark}apital
and Department of Government Efficiency [will present
options]{.mark}]{.underline}, including advance purchase commitments,
direct loans, or other incentives ... that accelerate the growth of the
U.S. industrial base to outfit our combat units with cheap and effective
U.S.-made UAS. To maximize these investments, each Military Service will
establish, resource, and empower unsubordinated program offices solely
focused on UAS, with an immediate priority towards small UAS. These
program offices will compete to determine best practices in rapid
acquisition and industry engagement with operational units. [[Drone
dominance is a **process race**]{.mark} **as much as a technological
race**]{.underline}. Major p-urchases shall favor U.S. companies,
informed by Blue List ratings and strategic guidance."

[[The defense]{.mark} portion of the [reconciliation bil]{.mark}l on its
way to the Senate is perhaps one of the most consequential attempts to
rebuild our military]{.underline} since the Reagan build-up of the
1980s. The text, written by the defense authorization committees, rather
than the appropriators, has [[provided D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense leadership [with **once-in-a lifetime
flexibility.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, with great authority and flexibility comes great
responsibility. Because [it may be our only chance [to **avoid falling
behind China**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} it is imperative that the
Pentagon's civilian and military leaders appreciate the magnitude of
this responsibility.

[Should they fail, it is **unlikely Congress will ever do it
again.**]{.underline}

The House and Senate Armed Services Committees should be commended for
working across chambers to produce and advance this bill through the
House. After receiving bipartisan support in the House, the legislation
should move quickly through the Senate.

The substance of the bill is transformational for several reasons.

First and foremost, the [[funding]{.mark} language [enables]{.mark} the
funding of **[ideas, more so than programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
there are billions for traditional programs such as submarines and
specific aircraft, there is \$13.5 billion in a giant bucket for
"scaling low-cost weapons into production."

This is a triumph and should defeat the notorious valley-of-death
funding, while also getting rid of the traditional "mother-may-I"
approach to acquisition where every time a program moved to a different
step in its maturation, a different "color-of-money" was needed from
Congress.

This money also eliminates the challenges of the past thirty years
related to continuing resolutions and new starts. [Most of this funding
is available immediately upon signature of the president]{.underline}.
No new start permission is required, except for an operating plan due to
Congress. It is also significant that the funds are available through
2029.

While the Navy and Air Force have several big programs identified by
name, [the [Army]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is mostly left out of this
bill, [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}, if it plays its cards right, deal
itself a winning hand by [[tak]{.mark}ing [advantage of]{.mark} the
bill's [flexibility]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the Army is
likely getting the lion share of the \$5 billion allocated for border
security. It should not use all of those funds for operating costs.
Instead, [it should use portions of the funds to pay [for]{.mark} the
acquisition and development of security sensors, software,
**[drones]{.mark}**, and communication equipment that can then be
[scaled for **wartime usage**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The plan [reprograms]{.underline} the DoD's budget even if funds have [already]{.underline} been appropriated.

PPAs = Projects, Programs, or Activities

Summary

[[Congress]{.mark} has [recognized]{.mark} a need to permit agencies
some **[flexibility during budget execution after]{.mark} the enactment
of [appropriations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and it has provided agencies
with limited authority to make spending adjustments. Congress has
established multiple statutory and informal practices to engage with and
monitor agencies in many of these activities.

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED \>\>

Congress typically appropriates funds in the form of an account, which
covers one or more specific purposes. Funding for each agency or
department is organized in one or more accounts, each of which may
include one or more related programs, projects or activities (PPAs).
Agencies may exercise discretion to reallocate appropriated funds within
or among accounts as well as within or among PPAs[.]{.underline} Agency
funding reallocations fall within the following three categories: 1. Use
of discretion within a particular account without advance congressional
notification: An agency may consider reallocating funds within a
particular PPA in a given budget account among allowable purposes (as
authorized by law) and objects (e.g., salaries, rent, programmatic
expenses).2. Reallocating funds within an account: Reprogramming is the
shifting of funds within an appropriations account to \"use them for
purposes other than those contemplated at the time of appropriation; it
is the shifting of funds from one object class to another within an
appropriation or from one program activity to another.\" The
reprogramming of funds is generally permitted unless it is restricted by
statute. Statutory provisions may also prohibit reprogramming funds
without advance congressional notification.3. Moving funds from one
account to another: Transfers---that is, the shifting of budgetary
resources from one appropriations or fund account to another---typically
involve movement of funds between accounts either within an agency or
across agency boundaries. Transfers are prohibited unless an agency has
specific statutory authorization to do so. This prohibition prevents
agencies from transferring funds from one account to another in ways
that may be inconsistent with the purposes for which Congress originally
provided the funding.Appropriations or authorizing statutes that provide
agencies with transfer authority often include restrictions on that
authority. Congress may also place limits on the amount of funds that an
agency may reprogram. In addition, statutes may restrict the use of
transferred or reprogrammed funds to specific purposes. Agencies are
often required to notify the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
a certain number of days prior to (or shortly after) carrying out
transfers and reprogramming.Agencies generally have internal procedures
for determining when and how a transfer or reprogramming of funds will
take place. Departments, their component bureaus, and other agencies may
be required to obtain approval from the head of the agency, from the
department secretary (e.g., if the transfer or reprogramming were to
take place across multiple components of a department), and, in some
cases, from the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
prior to transferring or reprogramming funds. Executive branch agencies
are also subject to guidance and procedures established by OMB.Congress
may consider how to balance congressional prerogatives and control with
agency flexibility. In addition, transfers and reprogramming of
appropriated funds may have ramifications for congressional oversight of
agency execution of enacted appropriations throughout the fiscal year.
Congress may consider the following issues related to the agency use of
transfer and reprogramming authorities: (1) agency reporting and
congressional oversight of reprogramming and transfers, (2) the
potential burden of transfer and reprogramming notifications on
Congress, (3) excessive or improper use of transfer or reprogramming
authorities by agencies, and (4) the financial management and budgetary
treatment of transferred funds.IntroductionCongress has recognized a
need to permit agencies some flexibility after enactment of
appropriations, when agencies engage in budget execution. Accordingly,
Congress often provides agencies with limited authorities to make
spending adjustments. For example, Congress may provide agencies with
limited authority to reallocate funds between separately appropriated
amounts (usually called transfers)---either within an agency or across
agencies. In addition, Congress may establish a framework for
transparency in how funds may be reallocated within an appropriated
amount, such as from one program, project, or activity to another
(referred to as reprogramming). In many of these reallocation
situations, agencies are required to notify the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees in advance, which may provide an opportunity
for the committees to learn more and attempt to exert influence over how
agencies use discretion.The U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the
power of the purse, and funds may be drawn from the Treasury only in
consequence of appropriations made by law.1 Enacted
appropriations---whether they come through annual appropriations acts,
occasional supplemental appropriations measures, or permanent
appropriations---often vary in the level of detail they provide
regarding how agencies may spend funds.2 In this way, Congress may
influence the provision and allocation of budgetary resources to help
ensure agencies\' actions align with congressional intent.3This report
provides an overview of transfers and reprogramming processes as they
apply broadly to agencies, including statutory restrictions and any
requirements for congressional notification that are applicable to each.
The report discusses reporting requirements associated with transfers
and reprogramming, as well as the roles of agencies and the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB). It concludes with a brief discussion of the
following possible issues for Congress: (1) agency reporting and
congressional oversight of transfers and reprogramming actions, (2) the
potential burden of transfer and reprogramming notifications, (3)
excessive or improper use of transfer and reprogramming authorities, and
(4) financial management and budgetary treatment of transferred
funds.Transfers and Reprogramming in Context

\<\< BREAKS CONTINUE \>\>

Many transfer and [[reprogramming]{.mark} situations [occur in]{.mark}
the context of [**annual and supplemental appropriations**
acts]{.mark}.]{.underline}4 When Congress provides funding in regular
appropriations acts, for example, most grants of budget authority are
provided by so-called lump-sum appropriations. Each lump-sum
appropriation typically covers one or more specific purposes and related
programs, projects, or items.5 Within regular appropriations acts, each
lump sum takes the form of an unnumbered paragraph, which during budget
execution corresponds to an account.6 Funding for each department and
independent agency is organized in one or more accounts. Each account
may generally include one or more related programs, projects, or
activities (PPAs), which are typically specified in congressional
documents.7

This statutory text establishes key context for how transfers and
reprogramming may occur. After enactment of a particular appropriation
into law, agencies may obligate and expend funds, subject to several
conditions addressed by appropriations statutes.8 These conditions on
the availability of appropriations include the purpose(s) for which
particular funds are appropriated, which may be expressed in statute in
more or less detail and, in some cases, with certain restrictions;9 the
time period during which funds are available for obligation and
expenditure---sometimes referred to as the period of availability or
duration of appropriations;10 and the amount of appropriated funds that
may be obligated and expended.11

Within the contours of these statutory conditions on availability of
funds, agencies may attempt to exercise some discretion in how funds are
allocated and the pace at which funds are obligated and spent. During
budget execution, agencies may also face cost changes or
re-prioritization of their missions due to external events (e.g., a
military conflict, natural disaster, or recession) or decisions by an
agency or the current Administration.12 To account for such events,
including circumstances unforeseen by Congress, agencies have been
granted some discretion to reallocate their budget authority. Congress
has established multiple statutory and informal practices to engage with
and monitor agencies in many of these activities.

Transfer and reprogramming authorities provide guidelines by which
agencies can exercise some of this discretion. Figure 1 provides an
example of how an agency, or several agencies, can allocate and
reallocate funds. Moving from the top of the figure to the bottom, the
types of discretion depicted are as follows:

Intra-agency transfer (purple arrow): Congress may grant Agency X the
authority to move funds from appropriations Account 1 to appropriations
Account 2 within the agency.

Inter-agency transfer (blue arrow): Congress may grant Agency X the
authority to move funds from appropriations Account 2 to appropriations
Account 1 in Agency Y.

Reprogramming (green arrow): [[Agency]{.mark} X, absent any statutory
restrictions from Congress, [may **reallocate funds** from PPA]{.mark} a
to PPA b]{.underline} within appropriations Account 1.

Agency discretion to obligate within PPA (orange arrow): Agency X may
allocate funds among Allocation i and Allocation ii within PPA a in
order to best support the purpose of PPA a and Account 1.

Use of Obligation Discretion

Under lump-sum budgeting, Congress will usually provide for some level
of agency discretion in obligating budget authority. Section 1301(a) of
Title 31 of the U.S. Code, which is often referred to as the purpose
statute, guides that authority. It provides that \"\[a\]ppropriations
shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were
made except as otherwise provided by law.\"13

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has discussed the purpose
statute in light of the necessary expense rule. Under this framework, an
appropriation of funds for a particular object or purpose confers
authority to an agency to incur expenses that are necessary or proper or
incident to the proper execution of the object or purpose.14 In other
words, an agency may have some flexibility to use appropriated funds to
pay for things that are not expressly named as a purpose but are
necessary to accomplish a stated purpose. In general, however, an agency
may not use discretion to make an expenditure that is otherwise provided
for in another, separate appropriation.15 Thus, an agency may, unless
otherwise prohibited or directed by law, exercise some discretion in how
to allocate and reallocate funding among certain organizational
subunits, objects (e.g., salaries, rent, contracts), and policy
priorities within the contours of the agency\'s statutory authorities
and obligations.

At the same time, an agency may face practical constraints in how it may
use discretion to (1) reallocate funds across PPA or account boundaries
and (2) create, eliminate, or reorganize its programs, projects, and
organizational subunits. For example, an agency may consider whether to
reallocate funds in a way that would constitute a reprogramming
requiring advance notice or a transfer. A reprogramming may involve
reallocating funds (1) from one PPA to another, (2) to create a new PPA,
or (3) to eliminate an existing PPA. A transfer involves reallocating
funds from one account to another.

Reprogramming: Reallocating Funds Within an Account

Reprogramming is the shifting of funds within an appropriations account
[to \"use them [for **purposes other than those contemplated** at the
time of appropriation]{.mark}]{.underline}; it is the shifting of funds
[from one object class to another within an appropriation or from one
program activity to another]{.underline}.\"16 The reprogramming of funds
[is **[generally permitted]{.mark}**]{.underline} unless it is
restricted by statute.17 Statutory provisions may also prohibit
reprogramming funds without advance congressional notification. Prior
congressional notification might be required for reprogrammings that

- [[**shift funds** among PPAs]{.mark}]{.underline} above a threshold
  level,

- **[[create or eliminate a program]{.underline}]{.mark}**,

- [[**relocate** or **reorganize** offices and
  employees]{.underline}]{.mark}, or

- [**[contract]{.mark} out** certain **[functions or
  activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} provisions of the United States Code (U.S.C.)
and [annual **[authorization and appropriations]{.mark} acts**,
[Congress provides the]{.mark} U.S. **[D]{.mark}**epartment
**[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense]{.underline} (DOD) limited
[[authoriti]{.mark}es [to obligate funds for **purposes other than
originally approved**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} or in a manner that
otherwise diverges from congressional expectations. These authorities
allow the department to transfer or reprogram funds. A transfer involves
shifting funds from one appropriations account to another, while a
reprogramming involves shifting funds within the same account. DOD uses
the term reprogramming action to describe both types of transactions.

Background

At times, [DOD faces **[unanticipated circumstances]{.mark}** with
budgetary implications]{.underline}. For example, [responding to a
**[geopolitical event]{.mark}** or covering an **[inflationary price
increase]{.mark}** for a weapon system may [create **unforeseen
costs**]{.mark} for the department]{.underline}. Similarly, military
recruitment shortfalls or favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates may lead to unexpected savings. To allow the department to respond
to such situations, Congress routinely authorizes DOD to transfer or
reprogram a limited amount of funds. (Congress may also respond to
emergent developments by enacting supplemental appropriations or
rescissions.)

10 U.S.C. §2214 generally covers transfers within DOD "whenever
authority is provided in an appropriation Act to transfer amounts in
working capital funds or to transfer amounts provided in appropriation
Acts for military functions of the Department of Defense (other than
military construction)." The statute [[limits]{.mark} the use of
[transfers to "a **higher priority item**, based on **unforeseen
military requirements**]{.mark},"]{.underline} and prohibits transfers
for an item for which Congress has denied funds. The statute also
requires the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) to "promptly notify" Congress
"of each transfer made under such authority." Other notification
requirements reside in specific appropriations provisions. In addition,
through procedures developed by the congressional defense committees and
DOD, the department's Financial Management Regulation requires prior
congressional approval of certain reprogramming actions, such as those
in excess of dollar amount or percentage thresholds. Authorities and
processes for military construction and intelligence-related funding
reallocations are beyond the scope of this product.

Types of Transfer Authorities

General Transfer Authority. The annual National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) and Department of Defense Appropriations Act typically
include recurring General Transfer Authority (GTA) provisions that
permit DOD to transfer a limited amount of funds. For example, Section
8005 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2024 (Division A
of P.L. 118-47) allows the SECDEF, with the approval of the Office of
Management and Budget, to transfer up to \$6 billion of "funds made
available in this Act \... for military functions (except military
construction) between such appropriations or funds or any subdivision."
Section 1001, "General Transfer Authority," of the FY2024 NDAA (P.L.
118-31) is the related authorizing language. See Figure 1.

(in billions of dollars of budget authority)

FIGURE 1 OMMITTED

requests, National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs), and Department of
Defense Appropriations Acts for selected fiscal years.

Specific Transfer Authority. Congress typically provides additional
transfer authorities to DOD in other provisions of defense authorization
and appropriations acts for specific purposes. For example, Congress
provides authority for transfer accounts intended to receive and
disburse allocations, such as the DOD's Drug Interdiction and
Counter-Drug Activities account. If Congress provides transfer
authorities for specific purposes "in addition to any other transfer
authority provided by law," their use does not count toward GTA limits.

Types of Reprogramming Actions

The FMR defines reprogramming in part as [a "[realignment of
budget]{.mark} authority [from]{.mark} the purpose for which
appropriated to finance another (usually emergent, unfunded)
requirement."]{.underline} DOD transfers and reprograms funds
[[throughout the fiscal year]{.underline}]{.mark}. As part of the
congressional notification and prior approval processes, the DOD
Comptroller publishes implemented reprogramming actions on the budget
execution portion of its website.

// SaMi🦋

House lawmakers advanced their \$832 billion defense appropriations plan
for fiscal 2026 early Friday morning despite strong objections from
Democrats over missing budgetary details and social issue fights.

[[The bill]{.mark}'s passage]{.underline} --- by a 221-209 margin, with
only five Democrats backing the measure --- [sends the national security
budget debate [over to the Senate]{.mark}, where appropriators [still
have]{.mark} **[n]{.mark}o[t unveiled]{.mark} the [parameters]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} their [spending]{.mark} plans for next year.]{.underline}

The Defense Department is currently operating this fiscal year
[[under]{.mark} a **[modified continuing resolution]{.mark}**,
[with]{.mark} some **[additional funding]{.mark}** for military programs
and purchases.]{.underline} Lawmakers are hopeful that won't happen
again next year, but [[the **slow pace**]{.mark} of budget work thus far
[leaves]{.mark} only about **[six weeks]{.mark} of session work
[left]{.mark}** [before]{.mark} a possible partial government
[shutdown]{.mark}]{.underline} if the appropriations bills aren't
finalized.

The House spending plan was largely drafted before Pentagon leaders
unveiled their detailed budgetary requests for fiscal 2026 just last
month. President Donald Trump has touted that outline as a "\$1 trillion
defense budget," but that total includes additional one-time funds
approved by Congress as part of a separate reconciliation measure.

As such, the House plan for the base defense budget represents a small
decrease over current fiscal year military spending, a point that
Democrats and some Republican lawmakers have lamented.

But Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., the chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee's defense panel, praised the funding plan as "providing our
men and women in uniform with the resources they need to keep America
safe."

The bill supports a 3.8% pay raise for servicemembers next year,
matching the federal formula for the annual prescribed pay boost. It
includes \$2.6 billion for hypersonics programs and \$13 billion for
missile defense programs in support of Trump's Golden Dome effort.

The measure sets aside \$8.5 billion for 69 F-35 fighters, \$3.8 billion
for B-21 procurement, \$2.7 billion for 15 KC-46s and \$1.2 billion for
four E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft. Another \$37 billion would go to
Navy shipbuilding efforts, including procurement of one Columbia-class
ballistic missile submarine and two Virginia-class fast attack
submarines.

Under the plan, the Defense Department civilian workforce would be cut
by about 45,000 individuals at a savings of \$3.6 billion, a provision
that drew strong objections from Democratic lawmakers.

Critics also attacked the bill's social issue provisions, including
language prohibiting military health care facilities from providing
abortion services, bans on transgender medical care and surgeries, and
elimination of diversity and equity programs.

"These poison pill riders will not go unnoticed by our troops," said
Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., ranking member on the appropriations
committee's defense panel. "They will impact recruitment and retention."

[[Passage]{.mark} of the defense budget bill was delayed for much of the
week by unrelated legislative floor fights in the House, and [could be
**complicated in the Senate** by]{.mark} similar, broader [fights
over]{.mark} **federal [spending and]{.mark} program
[cuts]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

House [[lawmakers]{.mark} are expected to **[shift focus]{.mark}** in
coming days [to]{.mark} the annual [defense authorization]{.mark}
bill]{.underline} --- [legislation [which]{.mark} sets Defense
Department policy and spending priorities for the upcoming year, but
**[does not]{.mark} actually [appropriate]{.mark} the [funds]{.mark}**
for those goals]{.underline} --- but a full floor debate on that measure
is unlikely to happen before the chamber's August recess.

### \*\*\*IRAN\*\*\*

### UQ---Iran Succeeds---2NC

#### DoD can succeed in Iran.

**Jeffrey 25** \[James Jeffrey; Former Deputy National Security Advisor
of the US; 7/4/2025; "How Trump Can Finish the Job in Iran--and the
Middle East"; Foreign Affairs;

accessed 7/14/2025; Lowell-DB; edited for ableist langauge\]

Developments in the Middle East since October 7 have demonstrated that
Iran will not behave like a normal state, no matter what analysts may
wish. Negotiations alone can slow the country down, yet they will not
tame it. But [decisive [military action can]{.mark} ~~cripple~~
\[[destroy\] Iran's capabilities]{.mark} and temper]{.underline} its
taste for [conflict]{.underline}, as Iraq's offensives and the U.S.
confrontation with Iran in the Gulf in 1988, the killing of the Quds
Force commander Qasem Soleimani by the United States in 2020, and, so
far, the Israeli and U.S. military operations all have.

In light of this, [Washington should [prioritize **eliminating Iran's
nuclear**]{.mark} **weapons [program]{.mark}** [and defeating its
**proxy forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Victory could lead to
comprehensive diplomatic openings or even a different Iran. [But renewed
dialogue or regime change should not be goals unto
themselves.]{.underline} Instead, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must focus on making sure Iran retains no nuclear
program]{.underline} that it could use to develop weapons.

SEIZE THE DAY

To achieve this aim, [Washington should [apply]{.mark}]{.underline}
economic and, if necessary, [[**military pressure** until
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} comes clean on its weaponization programs and
[[abandons]{.mark} all]{.underline} or almost all [[uranium
enrichment]{.mark} for perpetuity]{.underline}. This is the most
clear-cut and important mission and one that the United States now
completely owns with its decision to use force against Iran. Israel has
its own existential interest here, but by necessity it must coordinate
with Washington. Critics of military action are correct that the nuclear
dispute with Iran will end only with negotiations. But negotiations are
not an end in themselves, only a means to prevent any possibility of
nuclear weaponization. [And [in the absence of immense pressure, it will
not be achieved]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Washington must]{.underline} also better calibrate its policies to
[block Iran's proxies from returning to Gaza and Syria and to **reduce
Tehran's influence** in Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen]{.underline}. Proxy
pushback is hard, and these countries all have other issues---energy,
terrorism, humanitarian relief---that vie for Washington's attention.
But to truly stamp out Iran's regional influence, the United States must
subordinate these concerns and focus on combating Iran's partners.
Regional states, whose security has been repeatedly threatened by
instability in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, should play a leading role. Yet
Washington must be willing to counter Tehran's tactic of attacking via
its proxies by [retaliating not against them but against
Iran.]{.underline}

Outside Iran, the United States should heed Trump's words and allow
regional states to exercise their own agency, as it largely does in Asia
and Europe. But there are exceptions---issues that affect overall
security and in which Americans can clearly help. One is the
Israeli-Palestinian impasse, which although not the core source of
regional dysfunction, is significant. Until better managed, beginning
with a Gaza settlement, it will be a drain on American and Israeli
regional goals, including Arab-Israeli integration. The budding rivalry
between the two most powerful regional states, Israel and Turkey, also
bears attention. They do not have underlying security conflicts.
Instead, their rivalry is partly a function of their two leaders' mutual
animosity and partly the inevitable result of realpolitik. Trump, who
works well with both leaders, has an interest in calming their
relations.

The Middle East requires U.S. engagement in other ways, as well,
including ensuring the export of hydrocarbons, maintaining global
transport routes, and managing terrorism threats and refugee flows. But
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates now [has a
chance]{.mark}]{.underline}, in concert with the region's leaders,
[[to]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[permanently [stabilize the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}** and dramatically reduce its nonstop
diplomatic crisis management and half century of nearly continuous
combat operations. It should seize the moment.

#### **The US has an opportunity for [regime change]{.underline} in Iran**

Path to Regime Change in Iran";
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/right-path-regime-change-iran>;
accessed 7/14/2025; Lowell-DB\]

There are many paths to regime change in Iran. In 2020, two of us
(Edelman and Takeyh) wrote an essay in [Foreign
Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2020-04-13/next-iranian-revolution) in
which we outlined a way to topple the Islamic Republic. At that time, we
assumed that the use of force was off the table and that outside powers
could only gradually erode the regime's sources of strength. Israel's
attack on Iran this month has introduced a new and volatile element into
the mix, but the underlying logic remains the same. [In all cases of
regime change, the indispensable preconditions for success are that the
government becomes weaker]{.underline} and the populace becomes bolder.

[In the past week, Israel has done a **significant amount**]{.underline}
to establish the first condition. [It has not just disabled key Iranian
nuclear facilities but also **essentially decapitated** Iran's military
leadership.]{.underline} As of this writing, Israel has attacked 20 out
of 31 provinces and [**killed scores of generals and
scientists**.]{.underline} It has largely spared Iran's economic assets,
although it has [targeted domestic oil and gas production and
distribution facilities]{.underline}. Critics have said that the intent
of this Israeli operation is regime change, but it would be more correct
to say that [regime change might emerge as a]{.underline} collateral
[benefit of Israel's offensive.]{.underline}

[Supreme Leader [Ali
Khamenei](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/ali-khamenei) has
been]{.underline} comprehensively [humbled]{.underline}. He once stalked
the Middle East as the leader who helped defeat the United States in
Iraq and surrounded Israel with lethal proxies. He had defied the
international community and expanded Iran's nuclear program, bringing
the theocracy within reach of the bomb. His success abroad reinforced
his authority at home. But [the collapse of Iran's "axis of
resistance"]{.underline} in the Levant and Gaza [and Israel's current
pummeling]{.underline} of the Islamic Republic inevitably [raise the
question of whether such a reversal can uproot the
dictatorship.]{.underline} It could, but Israel will have to do a lot
more to shatter the coercive powers of the theocracy's police
state---and do so without military actions that kill large numbers of
civilians, especially women and children.

THE REGIME ON ITS KNEES

In its more than four decades in power, the Islamic Republic has faced
its share of popular insurrections. Every decade, another social class
defected from the revolutionary coalition. Students and liberals were
the first to go shortly after the revolution in 1979. This was followed
by elements of the middle class during the Green Movement of 2009 and
finally, in the late 2010s, the working poor in whose name the movement
was waged. The regime always beat back these uprisings. They never
gained critical mass, as most people believed that the regime's
Revolutionary Guards, the Basij militia, the street thugs who abet the
authorities, and the omnipresent intelligence ministry were too cruel
and implacable to defeat. Once the security forces started killing and
torturing enough protesters, the demonstrations, which did spiral into
insurrections in 2017 and 2019, petered out. For Iranians themselves,
it's been a deeply frustrating recurring cycle, most recently
experienced in the protests in 2022 that followed the death of Mahsa
Amini, a young woman who had been detained by the religious morality
police.

Now, after days of Israeli bombings, [both the regime and the Iranian
public appear traumatized]{.underline}. When things calm down, [scores
surely will be settled]{.underline}, perhaps even [within the ruling
elite as **power brokers**]{.underline} in the security, clerical, and
political establishments [get their knives out]{.underline}. Members of
the [Revolutionary Guards]{.underline}, for instance, [may blame the
civilian leadership]{.underline} for the country failing to develop the
atomic weapon that would have deterred an Israeli attack.
[The]{.underline} 86-year-old [supreme leader may have a **very rough go
of it** with younger members of the Guards who]{.underline} appeared to
[want a more aggressive nuclear policy]{.underline}. They will be
distressed that the vaunted atomic program that cost billions of dollars
is now in ruins. (Its actual financial cost probably runs into hundreds
of billions given the commercial opportunities Iran has lost as a result
of sanctions placed on it by the West.)

Although [Israel](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/israel) has
killed a lot of very important people in the country, all the
pathologies of the Islamic Republic are still intact. It remains a
theocracy drowning in corruption. [Core institutions, such as government
ministries, are in an advanced state of decay and social inequality,
especially]{.underline} [in the wake of soaring inflation]{.underline},
has deepened. Some observers imagine that Israel's attack will stimulate
a nationalist fervor that would help insulate the regime. But [the bonds
between state]{.underline} [and society are]{.underline} too
[severed]{.underline} for such an outcome. [In past demonstrations, the
Iranian people have **blamed their regime and not outsiders** for their
predicament]{.underline}.** **Another major protest movement will
undoubtedly arise. The question is what Israel and the United States
will do to tilt the scales in the movement's favor.

A VISIT TO THE GOON SQUAD

It will be tempting to offer the regime a lifeline should it agree to
abandon its nuclear quest. "Realists" on the American left and right are
acutely uncomfortable with the promotion of human rights and democracy
overseas. They don't see it as an effective American weapon.

The regime has always preferred to have the West focus on its nuclear
ambitions, not on its internal troubles. Many Americans and Israelis
have also not been hugely interested in supporting human rights for
Muslims. But the Israelis now appear far more attuned to how this
advocacy, even if applied only to Iranians, reinforces the chances that
the Islamic Republic might crack. Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin
Netanyahu](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/benjamin-netanyahu), who
has described the regime as "weak" and urged Iranians to rise against
it, and Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, both appear willing to
think more seriously about supporting Iranians from the ground up.

Trump has now called for the Islamic Republic's "total surrender," by
which he means the regime abandoning its enrichment activities and
nuclear weapons program. It is hard to see Iranian leaders acquiescing
so easily; they might instead agree to a diplomatic process and make
enough concessions, such as Iran accepting that it cannot enrich uranium
beyond a certain level, to secure a much-needed respite. A better
policy, however, would need to dispense with arms control as its sole
aspiration.

Although there is not a great track record of success when it comes to
implementing regime change from the air, Israel can do a lot more to get
the sparks flying. The military campaign that has focused on disarming
Iran needs to focus on the regime's enforcers. The Revolutionary Guards'
leadership has been decimated but its many military bases remain intact
and should be targeted. The regime's first line of defense in times of
internal crisis is its goon squad, the Basij, which is under the control
of the Guards. The Basij have committed enormous crimes against the
Iranian people. Its installations, including police facilities and
military bases, should be on target lists. So, too, the intelligence
ministry, with its many offices throughout the country. Such bombings
won't permanently destroy these forces; it will, however, inject a
measure of doubt in the regime's upper echelons about the availability
and reliability of its foot soldiers and inquisitors.

Israel would also need to expand its campaign to cripple Iran's economy.
The Israeli air force would need to disable additional oil and gas
infrastructure. The regime sustains its power partly through its
patronage networks. Unable to meet its financial obligations to its core
supporters, defections from its ranks would likely increase---perhaps
markedly. It is important, however, that such strikes be surgical and
limit civilian casualties as much as possible.

The most significant challenge of any regime change policy is to remain
focused on the task after the fireworks are over.
[Once [Iran](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/regions/iran) is disarmed,
Israel and the United States might be tempted to walk away and look
elsewhere. It is]{.underline} precisely at that moment that [it should
instead increase pressure on the regime.]{.underline} The United States
must maintain sanctions and check Iran's pathways into global commerce.
The Mossad, which has demonstrated tremendous capacity to work inside
Iran, should ramp up its covert operations, since the CIA historically
has shown almost no appetite for this, at least since the 1970s.

END OF THE ROAD

Given how weak the Iranian government may be after the current Israeli
assault concludes, it might not take much to keep the Islamic Republic
politically unstable. And [an intense American]{.underline} propaganda
[campaign]{.underline} through social media and other channels should
continuously highlight the calamitous and corrupt rule of the mullahs.
The Iranian elite stashes a lot of money abroad. At a minimum, the U.S.
Treasury** **should track and expose those funds. And whatever and
wherever opposition forces emerge inside Iran, the United States should
aid them with financial backing and technological assistance to the
extent possible, as long as these forces aren't politically extreme.

Iran belongs to the Iranians. They are the only ones who can in the end
determine the direction of their country. They have taken to the streets
in 1906, 1922, and 1979, and they can be counted on to do so again. All
[the United States]{.underline} and Israel [can]{.underline} do is
[weaken the regime and accentuate its vulnerabilities]{.underline}. [The
Islamic Republic has **never faced a crisis like**]{.underline} the one
unleashed by [**this** month's attacks.]{.underline} It's a great irony
that Israel---disparaged relentlessly by the Iranian leadership as a
savage, illegitimate colonial settler state aiming to humble Muslims
everywhere---may, just possibly, have opened the door for a new future
for the long-suffering Iranian people.

I'm with the proponents. [A nuclear-armed Iran,]{.underline} fielding
missiles of ever-growing reach, [is both an **unacceptable threat** to
U.S. security and a **consequential failure** of U.S.
deterrence.]{.underline} After years of Iran's prevarications, which led
even the Biden administration to give up on diplomacy, to say nothing of
Iran's cheating on its legal commitments
--- [detailed](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-25.pdf) last
month in a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency --- the
world had run out of
plausible [nonmilitary](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-25.pdf) options
to prevent the regime from going nuclear.

But it's also foolish to dismiss the skeptics' case. Unintended
consequences are a fact of life. An American strike could well drive
Iran to double down on its nuclear bid as insurance against future
strikes, especially if the regime believes it can safely resume the
effort once the attacks stop. The key to making the effects of
airstrikes stick is to give the regime reason to think otherwise.

Here, then, is what Trump should do: First, drop bunker busters on Fordo
and other hardened nuclear sites to ensure that Iran has no fast route
to a bomb. That would need to be followed up by dropping a diplomatic
bunker buster on Tehran --- the proverbial offer Iran can't refuse.

It would look like this. As an inducement, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates could **offer immediate [relief]{.mark}** [from]{.mark}
most economic [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with a pledge that
neither the United States nor Israel would attack Iran's critical energy
infrastructure and other economic assets. The United States could also
[persuade Israel to [end]{.mark} its [bombing
campaign]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The price[? [The regime would]{.underline}]{.mark} [have to [agree
to]{.mark} two things]{.underline}: First, permanent, verifiable,
comprehensive and immediate [[denuclearization]{.mark}, including a
system]{.underline} of intrusive [[inspections]{.mark}]{.underline} and
an end to its enrichment programs. Second, [[an end
to]{.underline}]{.mark} its [financial and military [support for
Hezbollah, Hamas]{.mark} and other]{.underline} foreign
[proxies]{.underline}. Trump could also threaten to lease stealth
bombers and MOPs to Israel if Iran refuses the terms of the deal.

The supreme leader might well reject the deal out of rage or pride. But
he would have to think carefully about the consequences. [The
regime]{.underline}, including its apparatus of repression, now [**looks
weak and vulnerable**]{.underline} to its [[people]{.underline}]{.mark};
they [might]{.underline} well [[revolt against leaders who]{.mark} would
[choose uranium]{.mark}]{.underline} centrifuges [[over sanctions
relief]{.underline}]{.mark}. As for Hezbollah and Hamas, they are now
spent forces, yielding dwindling strategic benefits for Iran at an
unaffordable financial and political cost. [And if the regime thinks it
can]{.underline} still [do anything in secret, it should ask itself how
Israel was able to track down and assassinate so many of its top
military commanders and intelligence officials]{.underline} as they
slept in their beds.

Donald Trump wants to go down in history both as a peacemaker and as the
man who stopped Iran from getting a bomb. And Khamenei does not* *want
to go down in history as his regime's last ruler. [[There's a big,
beautiful deal to be struck here]{.mark}. For all sides.]{.underline}

#### US strikes opened up an opportunity for negotiations with Iran.

On the other hand, [the United States sent a strong message]{.underline}
to those who would question its resolve to defend its interests---in
this case, [pushing back Iran's ability to develop a nuclear
weapon---and demonstrated its military strength]{.underline}. The strike
also reinforced the United States' commitment to Israel at a time when
Israel finds itself under significant threat. For Israel, Iran has long
been viewed as an existential threat, particularly in light of Tehran's
support for Hezbollah, Hamas, and other regional proxies. The strikes
are not just about nuclear deterrence but are part of a broader campaign
responding to the October 7 attacks. Though perpetrated by Hamas, Israel
came to [conclude](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFDh_6i9KbU) that the
three actors---Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran---believed they could launch a
crippling, multifront assault on it, with
Tehran [playing](https://www.memri.org/reports/iranian-officials-acknowledge-irans-role-planning-and-executing-october-7-hamas-invasion-and) a
central role.

Many of the broader and long-term implications of Operation Midnight
Hammer remain uncertain, including the degree to which the strikes set
back or destroyed Iran's nuclear program. But in the short term, the
strikes bought the world more time---time to find a negotiated solution
that will convince Iran to give up its ambitions to develop a nuclear
weapon. Without the strikes, would Iranian scientists be racing today in
Fordow's underground tunnels to produce the 90 percent enriched uranium
for an atomic bomb that Iran may have threatened to use---or even
used---to halt Israel's attacks? Who knows. But today, [after the
strikes, all signs suggest Iran wants to de-escalate the
situation]{.underline}. After firing a brief salvo of missiles at the
U.S. air base in Qatar---allegedly warning the United States before it
did so---Iran has [taken up the United States on its offer to broker a
ceasefire with Israel]{.underline}. [Negotiations]{.underline}---[from a
position of strength]{.underline} backed by the ability to strike
again---[have]{.underline} more of [a chance]{.underline} now than they
did last week.

### L---Arctic

#### Tradeoffs are the [primary risk]{.underline} of Arctic policy. 

**Bertuca 24** --- Tony Bertuca, chief editor of Inside the Pentagon,
the flagship publication of InsideDefense, 2024, ("New DOD Arctic
strategy warns of \'insufficient investment\' amid crowded global threat
picture," InsideDefense, Jul 22^nd^, Available Online at

Accessed 7/15/2025)

[[The Defense Department]{.mark} has released a new Arctic strategy,
[cautioning]{.mark} that \"**[insufficient
investment]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" in early warning air defense sensors
and other military readiness could imperil national security as the
region becomes increasingly challenging for the U.S. military due to
rising cooperation between Russia and China as well as the effects of
climate change.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a forward to the new strategy, states
a \"monitor-and-respond\" approach to [[the Arctic]{.mark} that
**[relies on new investments]{.mark}**]{.underline} and increased
partnership with U.S. allies is being driven by \"major geopolitical
changes,\" including Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, moves by Finland and
Sweden to join NATO, deepening collaboration between Moscow and Beijing
and the \"accelerating impacts of climate change.\"

\"This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue for strategic
competition, and the United States must stand ready to meet the
challenge alongside Allies and partners,\" Austin wrote.

[The strategy directs DOD to **enhance its Arctic
capabilities**]{.underline}, strengthen its ties to allies in the region
\-- seven of which are members of NATO \-- and exercise more U.S.
presence in the region.

The department notes, however, that [[the]{.mark} \"**[primary
risk]{.mark}**\" to execution of the strategy \"[stems from]{.mark} the
need to [balance against other DOD]{.mark} global [**commitments**
or]{.mark} find ways to integrate with other **[resource

The Arctic is [[warming]{.mark} some three-times faster than the rest of

([DoD]{.mark}) [will]{.mark} soon [release]{.mark} a new [Arctic
Strategy to guide the]{.mark} Department's [approach to the region. With
**global commitments** and **finite resources**, a **central
pillar**]{.mark} of the strategy [is working with and through
partners]{.mark}, especially our NATO Allies, to ensure the Arctic
remains stable and secure.]{.underline}

Recently [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} US Department of Defense
([[DoD]{.mark}) [released]{.mark} the latest in a series of [documents
dealing with its **Arctic strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accomplished
without much fanfare, Arctic Strategy 2024 sets out the main drivers of
American strategy, and several of the general principles for its
implementation.\[1\]

According to the strategy, "Major geopolitical changes are driving the
need for this new strategic approach to the Arctic, including Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the accession of Finland and Sweden to
the NATO Alliance, increasing collaboration between the People's
Republic of China (PRC) and Russia, and the accelerating impacts of
climate change. This increasingly accessible region is becoming a venue
for strategic competition, and the United States must stand ready to
meet the challenge alongside Allies and partners."

Thus, the DoD "directs the Department to enhance its Arctic
capabilities, deepen engagement with Allies and partners, and exercise
our forces to build readiness for operations at high latitudes." [The
strategy [states that]{.mark} US [defense]{.mark} activities in the
Arctic [will be "calibrated to reflect a]{.mark}
'[**monitor-and-respond'** approach]{.mark}]{.underline} that is
underpinned by robust intelligence collection capabilities, [security
cooperation with our regional Allies and partners, and the deterrent
value of DoD's ability to deploy the Joint Force globally at the time
and place of our choosing."]{.underline}

[The strategy candidly notes that [the **main risks**]{.mark} to the
success of the strategy [arise from the need to balance planned Arctic
activities against other DoD]{.mark} global [**commitments** and
**resource requirements**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### L---Logistics

#### Logistics make Arctic operations [specifically]{.underline} costly --- [trades off]{.underline}.

Russia contains 53% of the Arctic's coast and accordingly possesses
significantly more regional military infrastructure than the United
States does.102 This disparity limits American regional force projection
and, as will be discussed later, necessitates greater military
integration with Arctic NATO and soon-to-be NATO states. Consequently,
after several decades fighting insurgency in the deserts and mountains
of Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the Navy preparing for possible
conflict in the Pacific, [[the]{.mark} United States [military is
not]{.mark} currently [tailored toward]{.mark} operating extensively in
[the Arctic]{.mark}. [The D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense has recognized these weaknesses and accordingly has
increased training exercises and wargames efforts in the Arctic in
preparation for possible military action in the region]{.underline}.103
Additionally, the Navy and Coast Guard recently recognized the need for
an icebreaker fleet beyond the few rescue vessels currently
maintained.104 While certainly necessary, [greater
[appropriations]{.mark} for Arctic-specific [vessels means less
funding]{.mark} available [for conventional]{.mark} naval
[assets]{.mark} such as submarines, aircraft carriers, and support ships
that may be needed in an eventual Pacific conflict]{.underline}. Thus,
while the United States Navy must make significant investments in its
capability to prepare for Arctic conflict, [[**there will be opportunity
costs** that could reduce effectiveness in other
capacities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Previous rotations have demonstrated that [even "Arctic-ready" [Special
Forces]{.mark} units **[struggle in
Alaska]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}12 Recent observations
highlighted the Special Forces' inability to conduct even short-range
ground infiltration and unrealistic drop zone preparation for military
free-fall operations, which does little to instill the conventional
force's confidence in Green Berets. Credibility matters because, in a
future crisis or conflict, those same conventional commanders may avoid
employing Special Forces due to their previous interactions with Green
Berets in training environments.

During theater security cooperation events, Special Forces teams train
with highly competent European Arctic partners. When U.S. teams arrive,
they often show up without the necessary foundational skills to keep up
with their Arctic partners.13 Consequently, our allies are often
burdened with providing basic Arctic training to ensure the teams'
minimum survivability. Even after receiving training in these
fundamental skills, U.S. teams often struggle to keep pace. The frequent
personnel turnover within active duty Special Forces units complicates
matters further, limiting or diluting acquired base knowledge. As a
result, our partners are forced to repeatedly start from scratch,
impeding their ability to advance their interoperability with U.S.
formations. This recurring cycle creates friction with our Arctic allies
and hampers Special Forces' progression in the wide array of Arctic
competencies.

Special Operations in Alaska aimed at deterring Russia and China present
the starkest example of Arctic tourism by intending to demonstrate the
exclusive capabilities of Special Forces to operate in the Arctic. While
these exercises are useful for influencing the information environment,
highly publicized photo opportunities mask how little capability
actually exists within Special Forces beyond flashy free-fall parachute
and dive infiltrations. Special Forces may even be unintentionally
misleading U.S. leaders about the strength of its capabilities through
social media posts intended to deceive our strategic competitors. Tis
continued lack of preparedness sets the stage for potential disaster
during a crisis or conflict.14

These three types of events (JPRMC rotations, theater security
cooperation events, and deterrence special operations in Alaska) typify
Arctic tourism, in which the participating units tend to build minimum
capability solely for the event and then immediately shift to more
pressing training for upcoming; non-Arctic operational deployments. Just
as often, the collective institutional knowledge of the trained unit is
lost when most of the members rotate out, forcing the unit to start at
square one again with new members. The challenge of attaining minimum
capability should not be underestimated, as [it [takes **months** of
dedicated]{.mark} progressive **[training, exposure, and
acclimation]{.mark}**]{.underline} just [[to]{.mark} [survive]{.mark} in
the Arctic]{.underline}. [Elevating a unit from basic cold weather
competency to four-season Arctic capability requires]{.underline} a
significant investment of [**time and resources** that leaves **little
room for other priorities**]{.underline}. The [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [cannot]{.mark} feasibly have the same units
[simultaneously devot]{.mark}ing [limited time and]{.mark}1 finite
[resources to the Arctic as well as **other
regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Addressing the ongoing conflict in
[**[Ukraine]{.mark}**, deterring the **[PRC]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and
dealing with other challenges posed by our competitors understandably
[[demands]{.mark} much of the **operational force's
[attention]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but the United States cannot afford
to do this [[**at the expense** of Arctic
readiness]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### L---Security Cooperation

#### Security cooperation requires DOD prioritization.

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition, 130 encompasses DoS programs, but not
DoD or other executive agency programs. 131 In addition,
[[Congress]{.mark} has [defined]{.mark} "[security cooperation]{.mark}"
as **[DoD specific]{.mark}**]{.underline}, 132 but it has not defined
"security assistance." [The DoD]{.underline} adheres to the presidential
policy definition and further [defines "security cooperation"
as]{.underline} all its [relationship [building]{.mark} and foreign
partner [development activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
"security assistance," which the DoD defines as a subset of security
cooperation that is funded and authorized by the DoS and administered by
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 133 [The DoS, on the other
hand, uses the term "security assistance]{.underline}" in a manner that
contradicts the DoD's definition, employing it to describe any DoS or
DoD assistance to foreign military or other security forces. 134

AIA = Army International Activities

HQDA = Headquarters Department of the Army

A review of the [[resourcing]{.mark} processes and [trends]{.mark} in
recent]{.underline} (since fiscal year 1995) [Army expenditures on AIA
[show]{.mark}s that [the]{.mark} Army\'s budgeting [system is
**not**]{.mark} **well [structured]{.mark}** to account for basic AIA
expenditures]{.underline}. We were able to arrive at an aggregate level
of the direct Army costs associated with AIA for the period 1995-2001
(and make estimates until 2005). Since 1995, the direct costs have
fluctuated largely in the \$400-\$5 00 million range annually. The AIA
resource management problem is compounded by the lack of both a
definitive list of activities and a mechanism that links unofficial AIA
categories with official Army and DoD resourcing categories. In
addition, [the Army is [not]{.mark} properly [accounting for]{.mark}
many **personnel costs** related to security cooperation and, in some
cases, is missing an opportunity to increase the amount of
administrative costs charged directly to the customer]{.underline}. As a
result of the disjointed nature of AIA programming and budgeting, [HQDA
is currently incapable of capturing the **[many hidden costs]{.mark}**
associated with AIA.]{.underline} The situation precludes HQDA from
making fully informed policy and resource decisions with regard to
security cooperation programs.

In an overall sense, [[the]{.mark} existing security cooperation
planning [process is]{.mark} **exceedingly [complex]{.mark}**[,
involving]{.mark} a multitude of **[actors]{.mark}**, problematic
**[incentive systems]{.mark}**, **[incomplete info]{.mark}rmation**
exchange, and no reliable measures of effectiveness.]{.underline}
Virtually all of the stakeholders understand only certain aspects of the
process and/or have only partial visibility into the process. [The
drivers and demanders of AIA tend to have an incomplete understanding of
the [**resourcing problems** and]{.mark} the **[tradeoffs]{.mark}**
involved in making AIA choices.]{.underline} In turn, HQDA (the supplier
of AIA resources) has an incomplete understanding of the benefits of
AIA, and the Army\'s own resourcing tools are not easily amenable to an
in-depth understanding of the resources it commits to AIA.

### I/L---Resources Finite---2NC

#### Military resources are [finite]{.underline}. New expenditures [require]{.underline} a draw-down from other regions

**Wasser** **20**, fellow in the Defense Program and co-lead of the
Gaming Lab at the Center for a New American Security (Becca, "Making
Critical Choices for Better Posture Approaches," *Center for New
American Security*,
https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/making-critical-choices-for-better-posture-approaches)

The 2018 NDS was widely lauded for acknowledging that [[the
U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates [has **finite resources** and]{.mark}
therefore [must **prioritize its activities**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A
key element of the strategic guidance was the elevation of China and
Russia as top threats to the United States. This move raised the
importance of Asia and Europe to U.S. defense strategy.2

While creating a clear hierarchy of threats was commendable, [the
details of how the [DoD]{.mark} would implement this [guidance]{.mark}
was and continues to be unclear and has [resulted in
**haphazard**]{.mark} **attempts** to adjust
[posture]{.mark}.]{.underline} U.S. posture in Asia---with the exception
of a reported planned troop reduction in the Republic of Korea and
increased freedom of navigation operations---has remained remarkably
stagnant for the top geographic priority.3 Europe, on the other hand,
has seen significant plans to alter the U.S. footprint and establish a
new base in Poland, with the intent to better address the Russian
threat.4 The Middle East, despite being an implied region of lesser
importance, has received an influx of U.S. forces and capabilities since
the strategy was published.5 High-demand, low-density assets that the
United States had previously removed from there for use in Asia and
Europe have since been returned, along with additional capabilities.6
Moreover, while the DoD has undertaken combatant command--level posture
reviews, only minimal force reductions have been made in Africa and
South America, areas where the U.S. footprint is already relatively
small.7

Although the elevation of China and Russia in the NDS had obvious
implications for U.S. posture, actualizing these changes has been
difficult. This is in part because the prioritization within the last
NDS still does not go far enough in forcing DoD policymakers to make
difficult posture choices. [[Altering posture]{.mark} using finite
resources, manpower, and capabilities [i]{.mark}nvolves a dynamic
[s]{.mark}imilar to that of [a **seesaw**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[to
reinforce]{.mark} forces and capabilities [in one region]{.mark},
[forces]{.mark} and the same capabilities [in another]{.mark} region
[will]{.mark} have to [be **restrained**]{.mark} in order to balance
things out.]{.underline} With the United States facing further resource
constraints as a result of COVID-19, the next NDS\[National Defense
Strategy\] must further prioritize adversaries and geographic regions to
help determine a more aligned posture---one that better prepares the
nation to prevail against other great powers while deterring lesser
opponents.

#### Focusing on China is zero-sum with other U.S. military investments. 

**Burns 21** (Robert, "Pentagon rethinking how to array forces to focus
on China," *Associated Press*,
https://www.wdhn.com/uncategorized/pentagon-rethinking-how-to-array-forces-to-focus-on-china/)//BB

Austin also noted his concern about competing with Russia in [[the
**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "

This [[is]{.mark} fast becoming [a region of **geopolitical
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and I have serious concerns about
the Russian military buildup and aggressive behavior in the Arctic ---
and around the world," he wrote. "Likewise, I am deeply concerned about
Chinese intentions in the region."

That doesn't argue for abandoning the U.S. military's large hubs
overseas. But [it [suggests **more emphasis** on deployment]{.mark}s of
smaller groups of troops on shorter rotations to nontraditional
destinations.]{.underline}

This shift already is underway.

The Army, for example, is developing what it calls an "Arctic-capable
brigade" of soldiers as part of an increased focus on the High North.
That area is seen as a potential flashpoint as big powers compete for
natural resources that are more accessible as ice packs recede.
Similarly, the Air Force is sending B-1 long-range bombers to Norway, a
NATO ally and neighbor of Russia, for the first time.

China considers itself an Arctic nation, but the main U.S. concern with
Beijing is its growing assertiveness in Asia and the Pacific. In the
U.S. view, [[China]{.mark} aims to [build]{.mark} the **military
[strength]{.mark}** [to deter]{.mark} or block [any U.S. effort to
intervene]{.mark} in Taiwan]{.underline}, the semi-autonomous democracy
that Beijing views as a renegade province that must eventually return to
the communist fold.

A Council on Foreign Relations report this month called Taiwan the most
likely spark for a U.S.-China war, a prospect with dire human
consequences that it said "should preoccupy the Biden team."

"Millions of Americans could die in the first war in human history
between two nuclear weapons states," the report said.

Washington also cites concern about China's efforts to modernize and
potentially expand its nuclear arsenal while it declines to participate
in any international nuclear arms control negotiations.

The sharpened focus on China began during the Obama administration. The
Trump administration went further by formally declaring that China and
Russia, not global terrorism, were the top threats to U.S. national
security.

Some now question whether this shift has gone too far.

Christopher Miller, who served as acting secretary of defense for the
final two months of Donald Trump's presidency, said in an interview that
he agrees China is the key national security threat. But he said
[[U.S.]{.mark} commanders elsewhere in the world told him the **[China
focus]{.mark} was [costing them ]{.mark}**[needed
resources.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Funding for Taiwan requires tradeoffs from other areas

ADVENTURISM OVER TAIWAN: A THIRD WAY," *Lowy Institute*,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/countering-china-s-adventurism-over-taiwan-third-way)//BB

Finally, [[the]{.mark} hefty [price tag of]{.mark}]{.underline} an
unqualified [commitment to protect [Taiwan]{.mark} would [**need to be
traded off** against other]{.mark} potential
[investments]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[must keep its]{.mark} eye firmly [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the larger
contest: the broad-based competition of systems and societies emerging
with [[the PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}. Historical lessons on the character
of such competitions,\[53\] the geo-economic character of a wider
contest defined by the difficulty of military conquest, and China's
emphasis on gradual, non-military tools of influence suggest that global
economic engagement, technological rivalries, investments in diplomatic
capability, and information security and cyber capabilities will be more
important to the outcome of the larger competition than the status of
Taiwan. At a time, for example, when the central office charged with
overseeing US cybersecurity has been described as "underfunded,
outmatched and exhausted",\[54\] it does not make sense to pour tens of
billions into capabilities oriented for the defence of Taiwan.

#### DOD spending inevitably causes tradeoffs.

**Rue '13** \[W. Jonathan, senior policy analyst at a small consulting
firm where he specializes in defense policy and budget issues. A former
Marine captain, he served in Iraq as an intelligence advisor, "FORCE
MODERNIZATION AND READINESS: A ZERO SUM GAME?",
https://warontherocks.com/2013/07/force-modernization-and-readiness-a-zero-sum-game/\]

Having made the decision not to size the military for large-scale,
protracted ground combat, [policymakers are attempting [to **prioritize
modernization**]{.mark} and readiness **at the expense of**
personnel.]{.underline} There are, however, worrying signs that
[[readiness is]{.mark} being **[sacrificed]{.mark}**, and that budgetary
pressure will result in the very thing we wish to avoid: a **hollow
military**, which will make it impossible to project real
power.]{.underline}

[There is an inherent **tension between three pillars** of defense
spending: personnel, modernization and readiness. [Finite resources make
it **impossible to avoid tradeoffs**]{.mark}]{.underline} among the
three. Thus, [planners must balance between the competing needs of
each.]{.underline} By reducing Army and Marine ground forces by 108,000,
policymakers have decided not to size the force for long-term,
protracted ground combat operations. Not only do policymakers appear to
have lost their appetite for such campaigns, planners have justified the
decision with the not unreasonable assertion that raising manpower will
be easier and faster than, say, designing and building an aircraft
carrier, tank or fighter. Moreover, a decade of combat operations has
left the force with used and abused equipment that badly needs refitting
and replacing.

But even as the Department reduces active duty end strength, personnel
costs continue to rise. Personnel costs mostly appear in two different
accounts within DoD's budget: personnel and operations and maintenance
(O&M). The personnel account is basically military compensation and
consists of active duty pay and other cash benefits such as housing and
food allowances, special pay and bonuses. O&M includes the many non-cash
benefits like healthcare, childcare services, subsidized food and
clothing (commissaries and exchanges), and fitness and recreation. Then,
there are the deferred benefits for pensions and healthcare for
retirees.

For 2013, DoD requested \$346 billion for operations and support (O&S),
which is simply the sum of personnel and O&M. The Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) estimates that despite end strength reductions of five
percent, O&S costs will rise to \$373 billion in 2017. Since 2001,
personnel costs in the base budget have increased by nearly 90 percent
or about 30 percent above inflation, while the number of military
personnel has increased by only about three percent. Additionally, the
O&M costs per service member increased from \$55,000 to \$105,000
between 1980 and 2001. The CBO projects it will be \$161,000 in 2016.

The main drivers of this cost growth are military compensation and
health care. Military healthcare costs rose over 170 percent from
2001-2012, from \$19 billion to \$53 billion. The Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments estimates that if DoD spending continues to
rise at roughly the rate of inflation, personnel costs will consume the
entire DoD budget by 2039.

These [[costs]{.mark} are **[crowd]{.mark}ing [out]{.mark}** the ability
to invest in [modernization and readiness]{.mark} of the force,
hollowing the budget from within and weakening the defense
dollar]{.underline}. The Center for Strategic and International Studies
(CSIS) projects that even though the defense topline in 2021 will be
\$100 billion larger than previous drawdowns, it will only buy an active
force that is 34 percent smaller than the force in 1978. CSIS also
estimates that in order to maintain the traditional budget figure of 32
percent for modernization, an additional 455,000 active duty troops will
need to be cut.

The nature of sequestration in the early years prioritizes modernization
over readiness. Major acquisition programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter, littoral combat ship, Virginia-class submarine, the SSBN(X) and
other programs take their ten percent lumps, but such cuts are minor
hiccups for these multi-year programs. After all, what difference does
one less F-35 mean in 2012? On the other hand, a ten percent cut to the
services' operations accounts has immediate and real impacts. The Air
Force is cutting 44,000 flying hours and grounding C-17 squadrons and
the Navy is delaying critical refueling and maintenance for the USS
Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Army brigades will fail to meet
readiness standards for deployment.

[Modernization and readiness appear to be locked [in a **zero sum
game**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What good is maximum readiness if the force
is using broken and obsolete equipment? Conversely, [[how will the force
use]{.mark} the **next generation of [weapons]{.mark}** to their maximum
potential [if]{.mark} there's **[not enough money to train]{.mark} with
them**]{.underline}? In order to relieve some of the downward pressure
on both, personnel must enter the equation; [however, reducing end
strength will only work up to a certain point.]{.underline} Policymakers
must confront the rising costs of the All Volunteer Force if they're to
have a military capable of answering their frequent phone calls.

### I/L---Drones Key---2NC

#### [Uncrewed drones]{.underline} are [key]{.underline} to deterrence in Tiawan.

**Gargiulo 7/12** --- Guido Gargiulo, Contributing writer at Tiawan
News, 2025, ("Taiwan needs to go all in on drones amid growing Chinese
threat," Tiawan News, Jun 12^th^, Available Online at
<https://taiwannews.com.tw/news/6132917>, Accessed 7/12/2025)

[[Drones]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in the maritime domain, [are
not just tools. **They [are deterrents]{.mark}**. [They
complicate]{.mark} the [calculus for any]{.mark} would-be
[invader]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Imagine hundreds]{.mark} of]{.underline} small, explosive-laden
vessels [darting through narrow straits, [hunting]{.mark} large enemy
[ships]{.mark} or clogging key routes with unpredictable movements.
[Defending against them **drains resources**]{.mark}, **divides
[attention]{.mark}**, [and **increases risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the event of a Chinese amphibious operation, [[they]{.mark} could
[raise]{.mark} the [cost of invasion **astronomically**]{.mark}, perhaps
[enough to]{.mark} delay, deter, or even [**prevent**
one]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nowadays, [[drones are
**vital**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially for Taiwan.

[Taiwan's defense is not limited to machines]{.underline}. It's also
about coordination, readiness, and realism. Recent joint exercises in
Kaohsiung simulated complex hybrid threats, including the hijacking of a
civilian ferry by "international terrorists" --- a thinly veiled
reference to gray-zone tactics that Beijing has perfected: underwater
cable sabotage, illegal sand dredging, persistent incursions into
airspace and maritime zones close to Taiwan.

[[These are **not acts of war**. They are tests, probes, and
pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}. And Taiwan's response has been to drill
deeper, plan smarter, and integrate civil and military defenses.

#### Expanded DoD drones are the [only effective deterrent]{.underline}. 

**Pettyjohn Et. Al 24** --- Stacie Pettyjohn, Senior Fellow and
Director, Defense Program at the Center of New American Security, 2024,
("Swarms over the Strait, CNAS, Jun 20^th^, Available Online at
<https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/swarms-over-the-strait>,
Accessed 7/19/2025)

[[Drones]{.mark} have [**transformed** battlefields]{.mark}]{.underline}
in Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Ukraine, but in a companion report,
Evolution Not Revolution: Drone Warfare in Russia's 2022 Invasion of
Ukraine, Stacie Pettyjohn finds that today's drones have not yet
revolutionized warfare and only present an evolution to existing ways of
fighting. This report details the ways that [drones have proliferated
and impacted warfare in recent conflicts, with an eye toward their
likely effect on a potential future American effort to defeat a Chinese
invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}. The authors identify a range of ways
that [[drones could be employed]{.mark} in this scenario [to execute key
missions for]{.mark} the United States, [Taiwan]{.mark}, and
China]{.underline}, and find that all parties could make extensive use
of drones to rapidly close kill chains.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is betting]{.mark} that [it can
out]{.mark}-innovate China and use [drone]{.mark}s to defeat a People's
Liberation Army (PLA]{.underline}) invasion of Taiwan. Here, the United
States should view Ukraine as a cautionary tale. Ukraine consistently
has pioneered new approaches to drone warfare, but Russia has rapidly
adapted and scaled drone production in a way that Ukraine cannot match.
Technological and tactical innovations are necessary but not sufficient.
Mass production of an affordable mix of drones is also needed to support
a large and likely protracted conflict. The research found that the
geography of the Indo-Pacific significantly disadvantages the United
States, which needs drones with long range and considerable endurance
that will inevitably cost more than the drones used in Ukraine,
Nagorno-Karabakh, and Libya. Today, [[China]{.mark} is positioned to
take advantage of its large fleet of drones, which could provide it with
an edge in a war over Taiwan. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and
Taiwan [need to close this gap rapidly]{.mark} and develop a layered
system of counterdrone defenses [or risk being on the **losing side of a
war**]{.mark}. [Washington must]{.mark}]{.underline} also find a way to
[[supply]{.underline}]{.mark} allies and partners, such as
[Taiwan[,]{.mark} with military and commercial drones]{.underline}. And
[**the Pentagon** must consider]{.underline} how these diverse
technologies enable new operational concepts and doctrine. Ultimately,
the United States must recognize that while
[[drones]{.underline}]{.mark} alone would not win a war against China to
defend Taiwan, they [[have become a key part of the competition]{.mark}
and the United States cannot afford to remain behind]{.underline}.

Recommendations: Preparing for the Pacing Scenario

The findings from this analysis yielded the following recommendations
for the United States and Taiwan.

For the United States

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. Department of Defense ([[DoD]{.mark})
[needs]{.mark} to acquire more "good enough" longer-range [drones for
this fight]{.mark} in the Pacific. The DoD [must]{.mark} develop and
[procure drones with the range to perform useful missions]{.mark} in
this theater that can be purchased in sufficient quantities to make up
for the many that will inevitably be lost in combat.]{.underline}

#### Simulations show [China wins 18-0]{.underline}, but drones solve.

**Honrada 22** --- Gabriel Honrada, PhD in International Relations,
2022, ("Drone swarms may be key to defending Taiwan," Asia Times, May
23^rd^, Available Online at
<https://asiatimes.com/2022/05/drone-swarms-may-be-key-to-defending-taiwan/>,
Accessed 7/19/2025)

The [[drones would form a **decoy**]{.mark} screen]{.underline} for
stealthy manned aircraft, extending the onboard sensor capabilities of
the latter, and [[enabling them to]{.mark} observe electronic silence to
[avoid detection]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} networked drones [would drastically
increase the situational awareness and target acquisition capabilities
of manned platforms [while]{.mark} simultaneously [flooding]{.mark}
enemy [radar scopes]{.mark} with multiple targets, forcing them to waste
limited missiles and ammunition on expendable decoys before manned
systems move in for the kill.]{.underline}

Ochmanek also mentioned that machine learning and AI give autonomous
drone swarms the ability to look at targets from multiple angles,
cross-check various targeting data streams and suggest the best way to
attack a specific target.

[[Despite]{.mark} these [advancements, Ochmanek voiced
**concerns**]{.mark} regarding the maturity of the
technology]{.underline}, citing potential vulnerabilities such as
Russian and Chinese electronic warfare capabilities, cyberattacks and
bandwidth limitations. He also cautioned that the aforementioned 2020
simulation resulted in a Pyrrhic US victory.

This contrasts with previous simulations of a Taiwan invasion that have
ended badly for the US. In October 2020, the US lost a classified
wargame simulating a Chinese invasion.

"[Without overstating the issue, [**it failed miserably**. A]{.mark}n
aggressive red [team]{.mark} that had been studying the United States
for the last 20 years just **[ran rings around
us]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They knew exactly what we're going to do
before we did it," said Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General
John Hyten. The results prompted Hyten to scrap joint warfighting
concepts that had guided US military operations for decades.

Hyten noted at the time that the first US Joint Warfare Concept (JWC)
simply improved on the long-standing US strategy of gathering and using
ubiquitous information to coordinate forces and structure battles.
However, the JWC "failed miserably" in the October 2020 simulation,
since it presumed information dominance in a simulation wherein US
forces had to act without that advantage.

In response, Hyten espoused a new concept he termed "expanded maneuver",
which entails aggregating capabilities to provide significant effect,
and disaggregating to survive any kind of threat.

This is enabled by AI, cloud computing and machine learning, and could
take place in multiple domains under a single command structure, a
concept known as Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2), which is
the US' concept to connect sensors from all branches of the US military
into a single network.

Former US Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work has stated publicly that
in [[the **most realistic**]{.mark} Taiwan [invasion simulations]{.mark}
that the US can come up the US [has lost to China]{.mark} with a score
of **[18-0]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These defeats have shown that China's
A2/AD capabilities have evolved to the point that the US can no longer
expect to quickly achieve air, space or maritime superiority.

### AT: Replicator---2NC

#### It fails. 

#### A) [Models]{.underline}. Their based on short-range drones needed for Ukraine, but fail in Taiwan.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen [[Hicks]{.mark} last week
[announced]{.mark} a new initiative called
**[Replicator]{.mark}**]{.underline}, intended to deliver thousands of
low-cost attritable autonomous systems across multiple domains over the
next 18 to 24 months. [This is a laudable concept that [builds
on]{.mark} emerging [lessons from Ukraine to focus on]{.mark} conflict
in [the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}, and **[at least on
paper]{.mark}**]{.underline}, could catalyze the burgeoning defense
innovation ecosystem.

However, [[the]{.mark} unique operational [requirements of the
Indo-Pacific and the inherent challenges]{.mark} of achieving the
desired production scale are real challenges that Replicator will have
to deal with --- and [there]{.mark} simply [aren't]{.mark} many
[options]{.mark} available [that fit both]{.mark} those
targets]{.underline}. Ultimately, for an effort like Replicator to
succeed, the Defense Department should seek to invest in new
government-owned production facilities, not simply the systems
themselves.

It is important to understand that [[the classes of drones]{.mark}
relevant in the Indo-Pacific [are fundamentally different than those
relevant in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Taiwanese forces would
be able to make use of small quadcopters and maritime drones in a
territorial defense scenario, the closest the United States will likely
be operating from is 100-200 plus nautical miles away, with the nearest
sovereign US territory some 1,500 nautical miles away.

In August, [[the Pentagon announced an ambitious]{.mark}, two-year [plan

[[Frustrations]{.mark} over that lack of clarity [came to a

Global Taiwan Institute, 2025, ("Why U.S.-Taiwan Drone Cooperation Is

Accessed 7/19/2025)

[The U.S. Can Profit Greatly from Assisting Taiwan]{.underline}

However, [[the main obstacle to]{.mark} Lai's goal [is]{.mark} limited
demand]{.underline}. Even with Taiwanese government and military
purchases, [[Taiwanese drone makers]{.mark} [do not have]{.mark}
sufficient [demand]{.mark} to scale up their operations to meet the
country's needs and compete with China. Because of this, the Taiwanese
government is seeking foreign orders.]{.underline}

[[Herein lies an **opportunity** for the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. [The]{.mark} U.S. [economy offers]{.mark} a vast market
with a **[high demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} for Chinese component-free
drones in both the private and public sectors. With Taiwan's prices
being only 25 percent more expensive than China's, Taiwanese drones are
already fairly competitive with Chinese prices.

[U.S. investment would significantly [bolster Taiwan]{.mark}'s drone
manufacturing and lower prices over time, [making it]{.mark} an even
**[more formidable]{.mark}** competitor [to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

What's [more, [investment would not be one-sided]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While Taiwan is a high-tech industrial powerhouse, the U.S. industry
still dominates some technologies, like optics, that Taiwan needs. As
U.S. investment in Taiwanese drone manufacturing increases, so will
Taiwanese investment in the U.S. industry.

[[Taiwan]{.mark} also [needs American operational
know-how]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

According to Su Tzu-yun, a research fellow and director at the
MND-backed Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR),
Taiwanese manufacturers, while able to make quality hardware, struggle
to design and integrate systems for military operations. Indeed,
[Taiwanese companies tend to design drones before identifying their
specific missions and required weapon systems]{.underline}.

Because of this, Taiwanese companies would benefit from collaboration
with U.S. producers who could help Taiwan design and tailor its drones
to meet its defense needs.

To further court American investment, especially under the Trump
administration's "America First" agenda, many Taiwanese drone
manufacturers are willing to invest in U.S. industry by producing
components in the U.S.

Such reciprocal investment would help build up U.S. indigenous drone
production capabilities and capacity.

Reciprocal investment has already begun. Last year, Thunder Tiger, a
Taiwanese military drone manufacturer, and RapidFlight, a Virginia-based
drone company, signed an agreement to produce specific components in
each other's respective countries. Thunder Tiger also announced plans to
manufacture some key elements in California.

The U.S. government has also expressed interest in promoting joint
production with Taiwan. Last September, delegations from the U.S.
Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Defense (DOD), and over two
dozen private companies met with Taiwanese counterparts in Taipei to
discuss integrating drone component production to decouple from China.

These efforts are continuing under the new Trump administration. In
early March, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director Raymond Greene,
America's de facto ambassador to Taiwan, promoted drone production
cooperation in an exclusive interview with Liberty Times, a Taiwan-based
Chinese-language newspaper.

Then, on March 11, Taiwan's Minister of National Defense Wellington Koo
disclosed that the U.S. government was still exploring cooperation with
Taiwan to create a "non-red \[or non-China\] supply chain" for UAVs.

In addition to the federal government, some state governments have begun
fostering partnerships with Taiwanese drone industries. In December last
year, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt visited President Lai and signed a
memorandum of understanding for investment opportunities with Taiwan in
several key sectors, including UAV production.

Moreover, some U.S. county and city-level first responder departments
have signed contracts for small drones from Taiwanese companies like
Coretronic.

[Drone [Coop]{.mark}eration [Is]{.mark} the **[Key]{.mark}** to the
U.S.-Taiwan Alliance]{.underline}

[[Integrating U.S]{.mark}. and Taiwanese drone [supply]{.mark} chains
will [**increase deterrence** against China]{.mark} by improving
bilateral defense capabilities and increasing U.S. economic interests in
Taiwan.]{.underline}

Drone manufacturing cooperation will allow the United States to wean
itself off Chinese components more quickly and lessen China's leverage
on the U.S. defense industrial base. This task has otherwise proved
excruciatingly slow and difficult.

Likewise, [[a more resilient Taiwan]{.mark}ese drone industry will allow
Taiwan to [scale]{.mark} its asymmetric [capabilities]{.mark} and
ability [to produce defense]{.mark} material significantly **[during
wartime]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

While pursuing integration is far from a security guarantee, it
increases U.S. economic interests in Taiwan, [[raising]{.mark} the
[stakes for China]{.mark} if it considers invasion]{.underline}.
Operationally, this would be similar to the Trump administration's
recent mineral extraction deal with Ukraine.

role at the heart of Taiwan's homegrown efforts to arm itself with
aerial drones.

**[[The task is huge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with Taiwan's stockpile of
roughly 1,000 military-grade drones just a sliver of the tens of
thousands believed to be in Beijing's inventory, according to defense
experts. [[It\'s also urgent]{.mark}, with unmanned aerial vehicles

#### Taiwan and Ukraine aren't zero-sum. That's their own evidence

There is [no zero-sum game between Ukraine and Taiwan]{.underline}

In addition, [claims that US support to Ukraine prevents it from
adequately supporting Taiwan's defense overinflate the material cost to
the United States and disregard the benefits to the industrial base
surrounding US weapons production]{.underline}.

There is not a one-for-one tradeoff or a zero-sum game of munitions
availability pitting Ukraine against Taiwan. [Many of the systems
optimal for use in the defense of Ukraine are not suited for a Taiwan
defense scenario, and vice versa]{.underline}. [US aid provided to
Ukraine]{.underline} since the Russian invasion [is suited to fighting a
continental land war]{.underline} characterized by mass and attrition,
incorporating modern technologies. Specifically, this has consisted
largely of artillery and mortar rounds, tanks, infantry fighting
vehicles, armored personnel carriers, anti-armor systems, and
short-range unmanned aerial systems. All of t[hese would be ill-suited
for the air, maritime, and littoral fighting that would dominate a
Taiwan scenario]{.underline}. There is [little direct competition
between these systems and those optimized to defend Taiwan]{.underline}
and fight China, which also characterizes the bulk of foreign military
sales to Taiwan, which include sales of hundreds of Harpoons, Patriot
assistance, Sidewinder missiles, and Switchblade loitering munitions,
among others.

Finally, the [provision of US arms to Ukraine has served as a test run
for the US military industrial base]{.underline}, revealing challenges,
stovepipes, and other hurdles to meeting timely production goals. [This
postured the United States to course correct, yielding congressional
action to accelerate support to Taiwan, including the Taiwan Enhanced
Resilience Act, which authorized Foreign Military Financing to
Taiwan]{.underline} for the first time and amended Presidential Drawdown
Authority to provision Taiwan directly with US Department of Defense
stocks and services. [As US support for Ukraine's defense continues to
stress test it, the US industrial base will only grow more capable and
resilient, and will be better prepared to accelerate production for the
defense of Taiwan]{.underline}. Rather than a zero-sum game, investing
in Ukraine's defense now creates more opportunity for Taiwan tomorrow.

Iran;
<https://warontherocks.com/2025/07/lessons-observed-from-the-war-between-israel-and-iran/>;
accessed 7/19/2025; Lowell-DB\]

[The]{.underline} June 2025 [conflict between Israel and
Iran]{.underline} yielded a range of critical doctrinal insights for
modern military planning. It not only reaffirmed the continuing
relevance of conventional capabilities but also [underlined the
importance of]{.underline} cyber integration, information dominance,
strategic precision, and [alliance cooperation]{.underline} in
21st-century conflict scenarios. From this conflict, we derive nine
lessons.

One, try not to fight alone (especially if you have powerful friends).
[[Israel]{.mark}'s ability to execute]{.underline} Operation Rising Lion
and [maintain a **credible deterrent posture**]{.underline} in the face
of Iranian retaliation [would have been [**significantly impaired**
without]{.mark}]{.underline} the support of strategic partners --- chief
among them, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. The June
2025 conflict underscored the strategic, operational, and technological
benefits that arise from such alliances. Direct [American involvement
sent an unambiguous message of alliance solidarity]{.underline}. [U.S.
[military assets]{.mark} were [deployed]{.mark} rapidly]{.underline},
demonstrating America's unique capacity for global strike operations.
More importantly, U.S. forces [provided critical [missile
defense]{.mark}]{.underline} support through the deployment of several
kinds of advanced missile defense batteries in both Israel and the Gulf
region. This operational integration [allowed Israel to concentrate
its]{.underline} Iron Dome and David's Sling [systems on civilian
areas,]{.underline} knowing that [U.S. systems]{.underline} could help
[[shield military installations]{.mark} and broader regional
assets]{.underline}. Such cooperation extends well beyond munitions ---
it reflects [[deep interoperability, joint planning]{.mark} doctrines,
and **[shared intelligence]{.mark} frameworks**.]{.underline}

Two, establish air superiority. Air superiority remains the cornerstone
of operational success, but it ought to be supplemented by cyber
dominance, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance integration,
and electronic warfare. Israel's early success in neutralizing Iranian
radar systems and air defenses enabled its air force to carry out
long-range operations with minimal resistance. The seamless coordination
of stealth aircraft, real-time intelligence feeds, and electronic
suppression created the conditions necessary for operational freedom.

Three, ensure strategic precision. The success of targeted strikes on
Iran's nuclear infrastructure demonstrated the enduring power of
strategic precision. [Israeli and [U.S. forces]{.mark}, operating in
concert, were [able to destroy]{.mark} critical enrichment sites,
disable support systems, and severely degrade [Iran's nuclear
research]{.mark}]{.underline} timeline. Although the most deeply buried
facilities such as Fordow withstood direct assault due to hardened
construction, surrounding infrastructure was incapacitated. These
strikes delayed Iran's nuclear progress by an estimated 18--24 months
and served as a reminder that targeted, intelligence-led operations can
deliver disproportionate strategic effect. [Israel's access to [U.S.
satellite surveillance, AI]{.mark} targeting [support, and
shared]{.mark} signals [intelligence]{.mark} significantly
[enhanced]{.mark} the precision and tempo of [its
strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Joint intelligence
assessments]{.underline} also enabled rapid battle damage assessment and
[[facilitated]{.mark} strategic [decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}
within hours of engagements.

President Donald Trump said Thursday [he would decide in the next two
weeks](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-decide-us-action-israel-iran-conflict-within-two-weeks-white-house-says-2025-06-19/) whether
the U.S. will get involved in the Israel-Iran air war.

Trump's self-imposed deadline follows significant buildup of U.S.
military equipment in the area and puts pressure on Iran and [a
European-led effort to de-escalate the ongoing
conflict](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europeans-try-coax-iran-back-diplomacy-trump-considers-strikes-2025-06-20/).

Should the [U.S]{.underline}. become involved directly in airstrikes,
numerous [bases]{.underline} it operates from, [dotted across the Middle
East]{.underline}, [might support attacks against Iran]{.underline} as
well as become possible targets for retaliatory missile strikes.

The U.S. has already moved some aircraft and ships from bases that may
be vulnerable to any potential Iranian attack, two U.S. officials told
Reuters on Wednesday. The U.S. embassy in Qatar also issued an alert on
Thursday temporarily restricting its personnel from accessing the Al
Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military installation in the Middle
East, which is located in the desert outside Doha.

[Washington has also begun deploying more fighter
aircraft](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-moving-fighter-jets-middle-east-israel-iran-war-rages-2025-06-17/) ---
including F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighters --- to the Middle East and
extending the deployment of other warplanes, bolstering forces that can
defend personnel and facilities by shooting down drones and other
projectiles, U.S. officials said.

Other recent examples of the U.S. military buildup in the region
include:

A large number of tanker aircraft sent to Europe earlier this week

The USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group, which was sent toward the
Middle East, joining the USS Carl Vinson already stationed nearby

B-52 bombers and fighter aircraft spotted via satellite imagery at the
joint UK-U.S. military base, Diego Garcia, in the Chagos Islands

Why [[Israel may need the US]{.mark} to attack Iran to achieve its
goals]{.underline}

[Israel]{.underline}'s command of Iranian air space leaves few obstacles
in the way of its expanding bombardment, but it [[will struggle]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} deal a [knock-out]{.mark} blow to deeply buried [nuclear
sites without the U.S.]{.mark} joining the attack, experts
say.]{.underline}

Chief among these is Iran's [Fordow nuclear facility]{.underline}, which
according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, has thus far
[suffered little or no]{.underline} visible [damage from Israel's air
campaign.]{.underline}

Dug into a mountain, Fordow produces the vast majority of Iran's uranium
enriched to up to 60%, which could be refined further to weapons-grade
material.

The heart of the facility is buried up to 80-100 metres deep and is
inaccessible to all but the most powerful U.S. bunker buster bombs.

The Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz is buried even deeper than Fordow.
However, the IAEA estimates that an earlier Israeli attack on the
plant's energy infrastructure has effectively destroyed the plant's
uranium enrichment centrifuges. [But destroying the
facility]{.underline} altogether [is beyond the firepower Israel alone
can deliver]{.underline} from the air.

If [Trump]{.underline} decides to use U.S. forces against facilities
like Fordow, [he may opt to send the]{.underline} [[U.S. Air Force's B-2
Spirit stealth
bomber](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-b-2-bombers-bunker-busters-alternatives-2025-06-18/).]{.underline}

The bomber's internal weapons bays are specifically [designed
to]{.underline} maintain stealth characteristics while
[accommodat]{.underline}ing large ordnance [loads which could
include]{.underline} two GBU-57A/B [[MOP]{.underline}]{.mark} (Massive
Ordnance Penetrator), a 30,000-pound precision-guided "bunker buster"
bomb.

The MOP represents [the largest conventional bomb [in the U.S.
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}, specifically [[engineered to
defeat]{.underline}]{.mark} hardened [underground
[bunkers]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its massive size provides unmatched
bunker-penetration capability, while the weapon's 20.5-foot length and
GPS-guided precision targeting system enable accurate strikes against
specific underground facilities. Its penetration capability of over 60
metres (200 feet) through hardened concrete makes it effective against
the world's most protected underground installations.

[In order to destroy the facility at Fordow]{.underline}, which may be
buried as much as 100 metres underground, [bombers]{.underline} may
[need to drop multiple MOPs in succession on the same
target]{.underline}.

### !---Taiwan---2NC

#### Taiwan invasion sets off a [wave]{.underline} of [global]{.underline} catastrophes\-\--[extinction]{.underline}. 

**Easton 23**, MA, China Studies, National Changchi University, senior
director and research fellow, Project 2049 Institute \[Ian, "The World
After Taiwan\'s Fall," Pacific Forum International, Issues and Insights,
23.2)

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the strategic [**nerve
center** of the **world**]{.mark}. **No other** flashpoint is as
structurally **unstable**, as]{.underline} politically vexing, and as
[likely to **draw** the world's leading **superpowers** into a
war]{.underline}. Through both word and deed, Chairman Xi Jinping and
the Chinese Communist Party ([[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}) elite [are
signaling their intention to [**annihilate**
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}'s government [[through]{.underline}]{.mark}
the use of overwhelming **[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a
growing concern in Washington that it may no longer be a question of if
a Chinese attack on Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Having lost one of its leading representatives, the [**free world**
would likely be in the presence of]{.underline} a
**[growing]{.underline}** sense that [**illiberal** forces]{.underline}
were on the march and **[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
[[spread]{.mark}ing in an **[unchecked]{.mark}** fashion]{.underline}.
The loss of Taiwan could [lead many democracies to experience a **crisis

[[draw]{.mark} the [conclusion]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} Marxist-Leninist [[model]{.mark} was
**[superior]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or at the very least
ascendant---and liberal democracies too weak to resist the new world
order that Beijing was creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

[Taiwan's military **stands watch** over]{.underline} the vulnerable
flanks of **[Japan]{.underline}**'s southwestern approaches, protecting
Japan [and other **East Asian** countries from the threat of PRC
**expansionism**]{.underline}. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol and
monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

[If Taiwan falls, its military **bases** and
**intelligence**]{.underline} facilities [would be **occupied** by the
[PLA]{.mark}. The Chinese **navy** can be expected to base]{.underline}
its ships and submarines in Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases
at Su'ao and Keelung would be especially valuable for the PLA, [which
for the **first time**]{.underline} in its history would [[have
**unencumbered** access to]{.underline}]{.mark} the deep waters of the
[**[Pacific]{.mark}**. The **American**, **Japanese**, and
**Taiwanese**]{.underline} surveillance [systems]{.underline} that
currently track Chinese submarines in the shallow waters off the East
Asian littorals [would be]{.underline} rendered less effective (or
**[completely neutralized]{.underline}** in Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the [PLA would breach the **center**
of the First Island Chain]{.underline}. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
[[hold]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. forces in [**[Okinawa]{.mark}** and
[**Guam** at risk of]{.mark} **surprise [raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Chinese special forces and amphibious units [could use Taiwan to
**[invade]{.mark}** Japan's **[Ryukyu]{.mark}**]{.underline} islands
([**Yonaguni**, **Ishigaki**]{.underline}, etc.) [and Luzon, the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}' largest and most populated
island. PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in
Taiwan and the Penghu islands could [threaten a **blockade** of Japan
and South **[Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline} by cutting off their primary
sea lines of communication. The [top of the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [would be
"**corked**"]{.underline}---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further [reinforcing China's military
**dominance**]{.underline} of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline} negatively impact the health of
the U.S. economy and could [[trigger]{.mark} an economic
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in America and [[across]{.mark} the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent report asserted that
"[[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the **most [critical link]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the entire **[tech]{.mark}**nology [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline},"
[due to its **dominance** in]{.underline} the **[chip
sector]{.underline}**, original equipment manufacturing, original design
manufacturing, and role as a central hub for producing
technology-related materials. The report found, "Taiwan currently serves
as a [key supplier]{.underline} and partner [to]{.underline} many
leading [U.S. **tech**nology **firms** like Apple, Nvidia, Texas
Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S. allies
globally]{.underline}."8 [That would all **disappear**]{.underline},
forcing companies to suffer massive profit losses at the very moment
they needed to invest in costly new facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the Great Depression. In any event, globalization
would probably cease to exist, as the world splintered into hostile
trade and security blocs. [**[Supply chains]{.mark}**,
already]{.underline} significantly [impacted by]{.underline} the
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline}, the Russian invasion of [Ukraine,
and]{.underline} instability in the [Middle East, would be
[**shattered**. Prices]{.mark} would
**[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Panic buying and hording would be
followed by a [[surge in **nativism** and]{.mark} strong impulse
toward]{.underline} trade **[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
self-sufficiency.

fall of Taiwan [would undermine **perceptions** of U.S.]{.underline}
global diplomatic and **[military leadership]{.underline}**, straining
(and possibly **[[brea]{.mark}king]{.underline}**) [the American
**alliance**]{.underline} system [and]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
System. [China would be]{.underline} viewed as [the **most powerful**
nation in the **world**]{.underline} and the primary mover of the 21st
century. Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
[toward]{.underline} its vision of a **[new]{.underline}** centralized,
[**authoritarian** world order]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing**]{.underline}]{.mark} would start and [could
[easily]{.mark} rapidly **[spiral]{.mark}** out of control]{.underline}.
The likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking
out could [[climb]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} than anything
previously seen. It can be expected that the [**world** would begin
sliding toward]{.underline} the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**, and
human [**[civilization]{.mark}** would risk being **[knocked
backward]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its developmental story. Abstract
ideas like international law and universal values would increasingly
appear quaint, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of
empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} could be expected to
go nuclear and [[become]{.mark} heavily
**[militarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tokyo would likely be in the grip
of a profound sense of insecurity and disillusionment with U.S. defense
guarantees. It is possible that [Japanese politics could [swing
in]{.mark} a **right-wing**, [**authoritarian** direction]{.mark}.
Alternatively]{.underline}, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and Japan might [end up **band wagoning**
with China]{.underline}. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country could
experience a wave of political violence. Over time, it may even be
[possible]{.underline} that [Japan would become a
**dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [**South [Korea]{.mark}** would
likely [go **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by [building an independent **deterrent
force**]{.underline}. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the [**Philippines**,
**Indonesia**, **Malaysia**]{.underline}, and other Southeast Asia
nations that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they
had no choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves [with
Beijing]{.underline} against the United States.

[**[North]{.mark} Korea** would likely be
**[emboldened]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken and, if possible, [**destroy** South
Korea's government and affect a **[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States
drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems
probable that North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking
South Korea. [Beijing]{.underline} is likely to [see the situation as an
**opportunity** to drive American forces **off** the Asian mainland.
China's government would]{.underline} probably
**[encourage]{.underline}** and support some degree of [North Korean
aggression]{.underline}. At a minimum, an unprecedented campaign of
coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war. At the same
time, CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would
struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly **[expand]{.mark}**
its **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear weapons [arsenal and further
**[build up]{.mark}** its conventional **[military]{.mark}** along the
**border**]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, the [[PLA]{.mark} would
likely [focus on **re-taking**]{.mark} territories controlled by
**[Delhi]{.mark}**]{.underline} as its next major mission.
[[**Australia** will fear]{.mark} being
**[encircled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and isolated as the Chinese military
pushes across the South Pacific. [**Canberra** might opt to
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} its own independent [[**nuclear**
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} program and accelerate plans to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a distinctive
crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective security
organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe [[would **fray**]{.mark}. Combined Chinese and
Russian **influence**]{.underline} campaigns might [**succeed** in
getting [countries]{.mark} such as **Germany**, **France**, and
**Italy** to [embrace **pro-Beijing** policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
drive them against the United States [and **fatally [fracture]{.mark}**
the NATO [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} network. [[European
**disunion**]{.mark} might [follow]{.mark}, throwing the continent
into]{.underline} a political environment eerily reminiscent of the
1920s and [19**30s**]{.underline}.

\<\< PARAGRAPHS CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED \>\>

In recent years, China's policy has alienated Taiwan completely. As
China has bullied, threatened, and displayed force at home and abroad,
it has made unification unacceptable to much of the Taiwanese
electorate. And it has enjoyed only mixed success in trying to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically. It has managed to buy off many of Taiwan's
erstwhile allies, but its conduct over COVID-19 and support for Russia
despite the invasion of Ukraine have cost it friends, too---and those
former friends have turned to the island across the strait.Since at
least 2021, Taiwan has had a seemingly endless parade of visitors, from
Germany's education minister to Liz Truss, the former U.K. prime
minister. In November 2021, the European Parliament sent its first
official delegation to the island; the head of the delegation, Raphaël
Glucksmann, told Tsai, "We in Europe are also confronted with
interference from authoritarian regimes and we came here to learn from
you." In October 2022, Tsai received lawmakers from Lithuania and
Ukraine; the former had recently established a representative office in
Taiwan despite Beijing's anger, while the latter was making a gesture of
solidarity with a country that, unlike China, had been sharp in its
criticism of Moscow. A Japanese parliamentary delegation that arrived in
December 2022 spoke glowingly of Tsai's defense plans and emphasized
Japan's own determination to keep the status quo in the region from
being "changed by force or unilaterally." China has warned against or
condemned many of these visits.Beijing has only itself to blame for
Taiwan's strengthened diplomatic position. Its wolf warrior nationalism
and reluctance to break with Moscow have cost it European support. If
visits from foreign politicians were to translate into condemnation of
China at the United Nations, Beijing could veto a Security Council
resolution. In this case, like Russia, China would find itself a pariah
state---and unlike Russia, China cares about how it is seen by the
world. China's own corrosive nationalism has eaten into its body
politic, too. It has not torn itself apart in a bout of political
bloodletting, but it has certainly let loose the kind of jingoism that
would allow that to happen. What it will decide to do in a crisis is
uncertain. Beijing itself does not know.The United States, meanwhile,
seems intent on reviving a defense treaty with Taipei that it once spent
more than a decade trying to break. Taiwan has become a means of showing
China just how tough the United States can get. Washington is not clear
on how getting tough will alter Beijing's conduct, but "deterrence" is
the concept invoked most often. A show of force, the thinking goes, will
deter China from aggression. But what if deterrence fails? What if the
show of force backs China into a corner from which it feels it has no
option but to lash out? To this, Washington has few answers beyond
preparing for war.Some U.S. pundits have waxed lyrical about how they
would fight a war with China. Taiwan, they opined, will be turned into a
"porcupine" with hardened defenses. One former defense official
suggested the use of "low-yield tactical nuclear weapons" in the event
of a conflict with China. (The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
qualify as low yield.) The possibility of Russian President Vladimir
Putin using such weapons sent shock waves of horror through the world,
but the idea of employing them in a war with China became normal in some
circles. There was no guarantee that, once the nuclear taboo was
breached, the weapons would stay "low yield." But the question of what
would happen if the two powers escalated to higher-yield arms and
plunged the world into nuclear holocaust has been left unresolved.It is
as though the United States is being haunted by all the ghosts of its
long past with China and Taiwan, forcing it to relive questions it had
once thought resolved. U.S. military leader Douglas MacArthur wanted to
wage war against China in 1950. President Dwight D. Eisenhower
considered using nuclear weapons against China in 1955 and 1958. Today,
Washington abides by the "One China" principle, but it wants Taiwan to
enjoy "self-determination." It vows that it does not dispute the
formulation that Taiwan is a part of China, but it will help Taiwan
resist Chinese coercion. It wishes to promote Taiwan's presence in
international organizations, but it remains unwilling to recognize
Taiwan itself. The United States has shifted from pure ambiguity to
ambiguity with a tilt in favor of Taiwan---and it has done so because it
decided China is an enemy.Like China, the United States is mired in
jingoism and confusion. Like China, it has no idea what it would do if
things go wrong. With the 2024 U.S. presidential election heating up,
the one thing every candidate, Democrat or Republican, has done is to
show how tough they could get on China. Republicans vying for the
nomination got in on the act early; former President Donald Trump has
denounced French President Emmanuel Macron for "kissing Xi's ass,"
referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Joe Biden, with the power of the
incumbent, has not stopped at rhetoric. Whether supporting a TikTok ban
unless the app is sold or calling for increased tariffs on Chinese
goods, his policies are calibrated to demonstrate toughness on
China.Taiwan's own presidential elections, held on Jan. 13, showed just
how deeply the island's electorate had turned against unification. At
first, William Lai, the candidate from Tsai's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), vowed not to alter the status quo, though he accused
Beijing of doing so. Taiwan, he argued, was already sovereign. There was
no need to change what worked. But his caution soon vanished. While
campaigning, Lai defined success for Taiwan as its leaders being able to
visit the White House. This was a gauntlet thrown down---Taiwanese
officials are blocked from visiting Washington. The Biden administration
immediately demanded an explanation. This was not, U.S. officials made
clear, how the relationship worked. Where Tsai had been prudent, Lai was
willing to push his luck.The Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition
party, was not leaning toward Beijing, either. Its nominee, Hou You-yi,
the mayor of New Taipei City, said that he would reject both "one
country, two systems" and a formal move for independence, but that if
Taiwan were attacked, he would face the challenge. Taiwan, according to
Hou, needed to be ready to defend itself. On the crucial question of how
to deal with China, there was little difference between the policies Lai
and Hou espoused.A third candidate, Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People's
Party, was calculatedly vague on China policy. His campaign made clear
that he was depending on votes from traditional KMT supporters: those
who would have favored a closer relationship with China. He claimed that
he would find the middle ground between the KMT's appeasement of China
and the DPP's provocation of it; he would make Taiwan a bridge for
Sino-American communication rather than a front in a Sino-American war.
How he proposed to do all this was left undefined.Lai eventually won the
presidency, but it was not the ringing triumph Tsai had won four years
earlier. Lai scraped through with a mere 40 percent of the vote, his
victory made easier by the fact that Hou and Ko had failed to join
forces. As he prepares to take office on May 20, Lai faces a deeply
divided, volatile populace and a legislature in which the DPP is bereft
of a majority.This is a point China has been quick to underline. The
DPP, it huffed after the election, is not representative of "majority
public opinion." What is lost on Beijing is that the other candidates
made clear that unification was not something they were willing to
countenance either. Hou had made a point of not inviting Ma Ying-jeou,
the last KMT member to serve as Taiwan's president, to his rallies; he
knew that to associate himself with Ma's embrace of China would have
doomed his candidacy. Beijing still does not understand Taiwan.
Meanwhile, the United States continues to disavow support for Taiwanese
independence while making plans for further delegations to the island.
With the U.S. presidential election going into fifth gear, the risk of
miscalculation will only rise.At the edge of chaos, a single choice can
make the difference between order and catastrophe. More than 80 years on
from the Cairo Declaration, which held that Taiwan would be "restored to
the Republic of China" at the end of World War II, we can see that there
were myriad moments that could have yielded different outcomes, for
better or for worse. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt had insisted on
self-determination for Taiwan after World War II, if the Korean War had
not happened, if Beijing had made "one country, two systems" work, if
Taiwan had developed a nuclear weapon, if Pelosi's plane had indeed been
shot at---if someone had made a different decision at any of those
moments, the world would be a radically different place.

Full-Scale Invasion

[If China decides to launch [a]{.mark} full-scale [invasion of Taiwan,
the PLA]{.mark} would almost certainly begin these efforts by
[launch]{.mark}ing **[cyber and electronic warfare]{.mark}** attacks
targeting Taiwan and its defending forces]{.underline}.47 The ability of
modern states to coordinate their forces depends on a complex network of
communication and navigation systems linking sensors, shooters, and
decisionmakers---systems that often operate through predictable and
vulnerable nodes.48 Accordingly, Chinese doctrine directs the PLA to
conduct cyberspace and electronic warfare operations. By [[targeting
**U.S. c**]{.mark}**ommand [and c]{.mark}ontrol networks**, the PLA
[threatens]{.mark} American power projection and limits U.S. and
Taiwanese forces' [ability to track]{.mark} and engage
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline} even if they have the necessary munitions
to do so.49 [[Beijing]{.mark} already [has **substantial
experience**]{.mark} conducting cyberattacks against Taiwan's
networks]{.underline}.50 It would likely begin launching cyberattacks
against Taiwan's key infrastructure and government sites early in an
invasion, sustaining these efforts throughout the conflict to disrupt
information flow and prevent Taipei from mounting a strong defense.51

Some of the PLA's [cyber and electronic attacks would also likely
[target]{.mark} **U.S. assets in [space]{.mark}**]{.underline}.52 For
instance, the [PLA would likely **[jam]{.mark} U.S. [satellite]{.mark}
uplink[s]{.mark}** and downlinks to disrupt communication and navigation
satellites critical to both the United States and Taiwan.]{.underline}53
In addition, Chinese doctrine prioritizes [**jamming the U.S. global
positioning system ([GPS]{.mark})** to interfere with American
precision-guided munitions]{.underline} and conducting offensive
cyberattacks to disrupt U.S. satellite networks.54 Should Beijing opt
for further kinetic escalation in space, it could direct the PLA to use
anti-satellite weapons against U.S. assets in orbit, though this would
be a highly escalatory step. T[he PLA demonstrated this capability in
January 2007, when it used a missile to destroy a Chinese weather
satellite]{.underline},55 and it continues to test other anti-satellite
weapons, including ground-based lasers.56

Chinese doctrine repeatedly emphasizes the importance of different PLA
services [**[synchroniz]{.mark}ing [strikes]{.mark}** across warfighting
domains.]{.underline}57 In conjunction with its attacks in space and
cyberspace, Beijing would likely [order the PLA to launch a "**joint
firepower strike campaign**" [against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.58
Coordinated [**[precision]{.mark} [artillery]{.mark} strikes** would
likely [target]{.mark} government and [military facilities]{.mark} in
Taiwan]{.underline}, aiming to ~~cripple~~ \[destroy\] allied command
and control.59 To execute these efforts, [the PLA Rocket Force already
has positioned approximately [**one thousand mobile short-range
ballistic missiles** across the Strait]{.mark}]{.underline}, capable of
reaching the island in eight minutes.60 It also has approximately one
thousand medium-range ballistic missiles likely intended to strike
targets beyond Taiwan, such as U.S. assets stationed near Guam.61 This
long-range arsenal includes the DF-26, a ballistic missile that can
strike moving ships beyond the Second Island Chain, and the DF-17, which
carries a hypersonic glide vehicle capable of reaching U.S. forces past
the First Island Chain.62 Although [[U.S.]{.mark} carrier battle groups
have hundreds of [interceptor missiles]{.mark}, they can be
**[overwhelmed by]{.mark} large-scale missile [barrages]{.mark}** and
must stay far from the Chinese mainland.]{.underline}63

[U.S. forces **[lack sufficient]{.mark} stocks** of long-range munitions
for a conflict of this scale]{.underline}. American [commanders would
rely heavily on [long-range weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}---such
as Tomahawk cruise missiles and Long-Range Anti-Ship Missiles
(LRASMs)---to strike PLA assets, [but current inventories are
limited]{.underline}.64 T﻿he DoD has worked to invest more in long-range
munitions and ramp up production; for instance, it directed Lockheed
Martin to substantially increase its production rate of LRASMs in
2023.65 However, [[LRASMs take **two years**]{.mark} to produce, [cost
**\$3 million**]{.mark} **each**, and are [only compatible with
two]{.mark} types of U.S. [aircraft]{.mark}.]{.underline}66 This
shortcoming in Washington's arsenal of long-range munitions, along with
the PLA's vast arsenal of them, has [[created a]{.mark} "**[range
gap]{.mark}**," with China possessing longer-range weapons in greater
quantities compared to the United States.]{.underline}

[As [Beijing]{.mark} subjects Taiwan to a **barrage of artillery**, it
would likely [position]{.mark} its PLAN fleet of [153]{.mark} major
[naval]{.mark} surface [combatants]{.mark} throughout the East and South
China Seas.]{.underline}67 Central to its plans are Renhai Guided
Missile Cruisers and Luyang III Guided Missile Destroyers. [Beijing has
commissioned **[25 Luyang III destroyers]{.mark}**, each outfitted with
**64-cell [vertical launch systems]{.mark}** capable of firing
**[surface-toair]{.mark} missiles**, **[cruise]{.mark} missiles**,
[and]{.mark} **[anti-sub]{.mark}marine [missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Additionally, [[eight Renhai cruisers]{.underline}]{.mark} are currently
in service, each with 112 vertical launch systems cells designed [to
[launch **anti-sub**]{.mark}**marine weapons**, **anti-[ship]{.mark}
missiles**, **[surface]{.mark}-to [air]{.mark} missiles,** [and]{.mark}
**[land]{.mark}-attack cruise [missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline}.68 T﻿hese
ships would likely form Surface Action Groups near Taiwan and shield
invasion forces during amphibious landings.69 T﻿heir extensive firepower
would extend China's anti-surface, air defense, and anti-submarine
warfare capabilities further into the Pacific, creating new dilemmas for
American and Taiwanese forces.70

Civilian roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ferries complement the PLAN's
conventional warfighting capabilities. Despite China's significant
investments in shipbuilding, the PLAN acknowledged in 2015 that it
lacked enough amphibious landing ships to transport a PLA Army invasion
force across the Strait. To address this gap, Beijing began mandating
that all civilian vessels be constructed to meet "national defense
requirements."71 By 2019, the PLA had access to at least 63 civilian
ROROs capable of supporting military operations, giving it the capacity
to transport and land more troops than the U.S. Navy.72 In 2022, the PLA
began incorporating ROROs into large-scale military exercises.73 While
it would be unlikely for Beijing to activate all of these dual-use ships
for an invasion of Taiwan, they add to China's amphibious capabilities
and would provide PLA commanders with a greater number of options to
transport soldiers and equipment across the Strait to beachheads.74

[The [PLA]{.mark} has also developed an extensive air defense network to
protect its forces and [restrict]{.mark} enemy air
[operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ground-based systems in this network
can engage targets [up to **[556 kilometers]{.mark}** from the Chinese
mainland.]{.underline}75 The PLAN also contributes to the network---for
instance, [its destroyers are equipped with **surface-to-air
[missiles]{.mark}** capable of [engag]{.mark}ing [targets]{.mark} up to
**[200 kilometers away]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}76 These air
defense systems [would likely **[target Taiwan]{.mark}ese [and
America]{.mark}n aircraft** conducting surveillance and attack
operations near Taiwan and China]{.underline}, as well as defend
military installations and population centers on the Chinese mainland.77
Adding to this threat are advancements in the PLA's counter-drone
capabilities, including high-power microwaves capable of destroying even
small drones near its forces.78

[[All]{.mark} of these capabilities are meant to [support]{.mark} the
main spearhead of **China's [invasion]{.mark} strategy**: the Joint
Island Landing Campaign]{.underline}. The PLA Army has six amphibious
combined arms brigades, four of which fall under Eastern Theater Command
near Taiwan.79 Their annual training includes individual and joint
large-scale exercises designed to closely replicate the conditions of an
amphibious landing on Taiwan.80 In addition, they are positioned near
ports of embarkation to facilitate rapid deployment with all necessary
equipment and integrated tank, artillery, and infantry elements.81 Af﻿ter
landing, they would likely prioritize capturing and holding one of the
few limited beachheads in Taiwan. If successful, the PLA would then face
a challenging and costly campaign across Taiwan's mountainous and urban
terrain, with the ultimate goal of seizing Taipei.82

The Technology

"The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's
not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him." --- Sun Tzu, The
Art of War. 83

Levels of Autonomy

As outlined in Section 2, China poses a significant threat to Taiwan
given its ability to conduct complex naval operations around the island,
coordinate multi-domain strikes on key targets, and transport invasion
forces across the Strait using both military and civilian vessels. PLA
attacks aimed at inflicting heavy losses on opposing forces and
~~crippling~~ \[destroying\] allied surveillance and communication
networks are central to Beijing's strategy. In this context, many [U.S.
defense officials consider **[auto]{.mark}nomous [weapon]{.mark}
system[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Replicator Initiative as
[critical to countering China's military threat. Autonomous weapon
systems]{.underline}, if attritable, [could help **[match the
PLA]{.mark}'s scale** while also [decreasing risk to]{.mark} U.S.
military [personnel]{.mark} and [reducing]{.mark} the DoD's [manpower
requirements]{.mark}.]{.underline} As previously noted, the PLA will
likely use electronic warfare to disrupt all forms of communication,
underscoring the operational requirement for fully autonomous weapon
systems that can operate without human guidance. [[Auto]{.mark}nomous
[weapon]{.mark} system[s]{.mark}]{.underline} could also theoretically
[[execute tasks]{.mark} more [**efficiently** and]{.mark} with
**[quicker]{.mark} reaction times**]{.underline} compared to remotely
piloted or manned platforms. In other words, [autonomous weapon
systems]{.underline} promise to [[enhance]{.mark} both the **[mass and
precision]{.mark}** of U.S. forces---two critical qualities for
[degrading China's ability to seize Taiwan]{.mark} by
force]{.underline}.84

### AT: Stays Conventional---2NC

#### Any US-China war goes nuclear quickly

**Chang 18**, CNN contributor (Gordon, \"China and Russia Have Set a
Nuclear Collision Course With the United States,\" Daily Beast,
https://www.thedailybeast.com/china-and-russia-have-set-a-nuclear-collision-course-with-the-united-states?ref=scroll)

Moreover, [[any conflict between China and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[in the
Pacific could **quickly escalate to nuclear war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

China, surpassing the U.S. last year, now boasts the world's largest
navy, and it is adding to its fleet "at a stunning rate," according to
the Times. Even last year, the count was lopsided with China claiming
317 surface vessels and subs in active service and the U.S. 283.

Of course, it's not clear how capable the People's Liberation Army Navy
is. The PLAN, as it is known, has never participated in a large-scale
wartime engagement at sea, and its fleet is not, on the whole, as modern
as America's.

Nonetheless, China has a few critical advantages. Its naval assets are
concentrated along its shores and U.S. forces are spread around the
globe; areas of likely conflict are near China and far from America; and
the PLAN has some crucial weapons that are better than those of the
United States, especially anti-ship missiles. Beijing has also gone big
into "asymmetric" warfare, for instance militarizing fishing fleets,
enlisting the "little blue men" of what has become a maritime militia.

The Chinese also have one other advantage: the will to use force to take
what is in the possession of others. In their peripheral seas, they
grabbed control of the Paracel Islands, in the northern portion of the
South China Sea, from South Vietnam in 1974 after a short battle. The
Chinese also seized Mischief Reef from the Philippines in a series of
actions from late 1994 to early 1995, and they snatched Scarborough
Shoal, also from Manila, in early 2012. Now, China is, among other
things, pressuring other Philippine features in the South China Sea and
using menacing tactics to take over a chain of uninhabited islets
currently under Japanese control in the East China Sea.

Moreover, [[Beijing]{.mark} has]{.underline} clearly [[**relished**
challenging the U.S.]{.mark} Navy and Air Force in the global
commons]{.underline}, threatening and on occasion [[harassing American
ships, planes, and drones]{.mark}.]{.underline} The seizure of an
American drone in international waters in December 2016, in sight of the
USNS Bowditch and in defiance of radio commands, was brazen and nothing
short of an act of war.

Moreover, Beijing's harassment of the USNS Impeccable in March 2009 in
the South China Sea, using its maritime militia, was so severe that it
constituted an attack on the United States.

"The key point is that [[China accepts the risk of
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} to a greater extent than does the U.S.,
[[because China uses]{.mark} [confrontation to alter the status quo in
its favor]{.mark}]{.underline}," Anders Corr, editor of Great Powers,
Grand Strategies: The New Game in the South China Sea, told the National
Interest at the beginning of this year.

[China is]{.underline} apparently [willing to escalate all the
way.]{.underline} But the New York Times, in its reporting last month,
did not mention one Chinese threat to American forces in the region:
nuclear attack.

"[[For regional war]{.underline}]{.mark}fare, **[[especially in

Fisher of the International Assessment and Strategy Center told The

ground to justify offensive military campaigns to retrieve 'lost'
territory, [[we should be prepared for China's **very early use of
nuclear weapons**]{.mark} to support its theater campaign]{.underline}.
[We can]{.underline}, for example, [expect]{.underline} China to
'demonstrate' nuclear weapons at sea to deter American or Japanese
military support for Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack, or even
[outright Chinese use of nuclear weapons against Japanese bases

#### Drones are already a military priority, they have 0 cards saying that drones would be cut. Independently removing restrictions decrease need for more drones.

memo,\" Breaking Defense, July 10th, Available Online at
https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/hegseth-signs-unleashing-us-military-drone-dominance-memo,
Accessed 07-15-2025)

WASHINGTON --- [Defense Secretary Pete [Hegseth]{.mark} is [directing
every US]{.mark} Army [squad to be armed with]{.mark} small, one-way
attack [drones by]{.mark} the end of fiscal [2026]{.mark}, while also
enabling troops to modify small drones as necessary in the field as part
of a [push to break through policy]{.mark} and acquisition
[barriers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[While [global]{.mark} military drone [production skyrocketed]{.mark}
over the last three years, the previous administration deployed red
tape]{.underline}," Hegseth wrote in the Unleashing US Military Drone
Dominance memo dated today. "[US [units are not outfitted]{.mark} with
the lethal small drones the modern battlefield requires."]{.underline}

Continued Hegseth, "The directives... support our industrial base,
reform acquisition, and field new technology for the warfighter.
[[Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions]{.mark},
especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were
slow to pursue]{.underline}."

That new Pentagon memo follows an early June executive order from the
White House dubbed, "Unleashing American Drone Domination" focusing more
broadly on commercial UAS. Hegseth's directive, though, is aimed at
drilling down on what that means for the Department of Defense.

For starters, [[Hegseth rescinds several DoD policies]{.mark}
including]{.underline}:

The 2022 "Exception to Policy Requirement for Blue Small Unmanned
Aircraft Systems" memo that outlines circumstances where a
Governmentwide Commercial Purchase Card (GPC) can be used to purchase
sUAS; and

A 2021 memo that outlines the guidance for procedures for the operation
and procurement of UAS to implement Section 848 of the 2020 National
Defense Authorization Act that, in part, prohibited the procurement and
operation of drones by certain foreign entities.

"I am [[rescinding restrictive policies that hindered production
and]{.mark} limited [access]{.mark} to these vital
technologies]{.underline}, unleashing the combined potential of American
manufacturing and warfighter ingenuity. I am delegating authorities to
procure and operate drones from the bureaucracy to our warfighters," he
added.

One military official told Breaking Defense that those two policies made
it "[[overly restrictive and burdensome]{.underline}]{.mark}" for the
services to procure UAS, and in some cases exceeded the requirements of
NDAA 848.

Even after the 2023 American Security Drone Act provided more exceptions
for DoD to procure drones, the Biden administration did not change those
policies that remained more restrictive.

Hegseth also directs the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan
Caine, to revise the Joint Unmanned Aircraft Systems Minimum Training
Standards (3255.01) so that it excludes Group 1 and 2 drones, while also
revising just what drones fit into the Group 3 --- a weight that spans
56lbs all the way up to 1,319 lbs.

The military official explained that this "outdated policy" --- penned
in 2009 and updated in 2011 --- sets joint training requirements based
on the group or weight of the UAS.

"[As technology, mission complexity, lethality, and proliferation of UAS
are moving so rapidly, we must develop new standards]{.underline}," the
military official added. "The directive for the CJCS to initiate a
revision ensures there is not a policy gap in standards while it's
updated."

### No Cuts---1AR

#### New defense strategy is thoroughly invested in drones, they wont be cut

[US Defence Secretary Pete [Hegseth wants drones to be]{.mark} seen for
what they've really become: [disposable]{.mark} munitions, not prized
aircraft. [This shift]{.mark}, spelled out in a sweeping new Pentagon
memo, could [reshape]{.mark} [how the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [fights, builds, and trains]{.mark} for war for decades
to come.]{.underline}

[Hegseth's [order tears up]{.mark} the [old playbook that slowed drone
development]{.mark} with paperwork]{.underline}, endless sign-offs, and
tangled chains of command. His message is blunt: the enemy is churning
out millions of cheap drones every year --- Russia alone aims for four
million this year, Ukraine even more. Meanwhile, US frontline units have
been forced to make do with decades-old procurement systems designed for
F-35s, not quadcopters.

[So, the Pentagon is flipping the table. Under the new rules, [small
drones]{.mark} --- Group 1 and Group 2 in Pentagon-speak --- are
[reclassified as consumables]{.mark}]{.underline}. Think hand grenades,
not stealth bombers. Commanders at the O-6 level --- colonels, captains,
equivalents --- now have the green light to buy, test, modify and deploy
these drones directly, no more waiting for approval from the top brass
or the distant bureaucracy.

At the core of this pivot is an industrial push. "Our overt preference
is to Buy American," Hegseth insisted. That means direct loans, advance
purchase deals, and fast-track approvals for homegrown drone makers. The
goal? A home-grown swarm of cheap, clever drones designed by American
engineers and AI experts. Not one or two prototypes, but millions.

[[Manufacture fast, train hard, buy American]{.underline}]{.mark}

The overhaul rests on three pillars. First, [[expand domestic
production]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hegseth wants American drones built by
American companies. The [[memo demands the Pentagon lean hard on
domestic suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark}, using direct loans, advance
purchases and private capital to flood the force with cheap, expendable
drones.

"Our overt preference is to Buy American," Hegseth writes. "We will
power a technological leapfrog, arming our combat units with a variety
of low-cost drones made by America's world-leading engineers and AI
experts."

[[Second, he wants process reform]{.underline}]{.mark}. Building drone
dominance isn't just about tech --- [[it's about
speed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Past rules treated small drones like fighter
jets, bogging them down with the same airworthiness certifications and
NATO standards meant for billion-dollar aircraft. From now on, [[small
drones won't need]{.mark} [the same testing]{.mark}. They'll be made,
modified and lost in combat --- and replaced just as fast]{.underline}.

"Drone dominance is a process race as much as a technological race,"
Hegseth writes. The new approach fuses frontline needs with the factory
floor. Prototypes, 3D printing, battlefield tweaks --- all encouraged.

[The third pillar is training. [By the end of 2026, every US]{.mark}
Army [squad must have one-way attack drones]{.mark} in its
kit]{.underline}. By 2027, major training events must include drones,
swarm scenarios, live-fire tests, drone-vs-drone battles. Senior
officers are under orders to strip away range restrictions, expand
testing grounds, and make drone use second nature.

Hegseth's memo implores American forces to find similar ways to advance
drone warfare. [He also [calls for]{.mark} the [military]{.mark}
services [to]{.mark} consider what expensive weapons systems could be
replaced by [cheap, disposable drones.]{.mark}]{.underline}

He gave the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force 60 days to
report to him any major weapons that could be "more cost effective or
lethal" if replaced by small drones.

He also ordered the military to expand its use of 3D printing and other
in-house drone building capabilities and stand up purpose-built
innovation units meant to exclusively innovate drone warfare within the
Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps by Sept. 1.

"Our adversaries have a head start in small UAS, but we will perform a
technological leapfrog and establish small UAS domain dominance by the
end of 2027," Hegseth wrote in his memo. "We will accomplish this urgent
goal by combining the nation's best qualities, including risk-taking.
Senior officers must set the tone.

**Lee 25** \[Matthew Lee; Writer for the Associated Press; 7/11/2025;
"State Department is firing over 1,300 employees under Trump
administration plan"; PBS News;
<https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/state-department-is-firing-over-1300-employees-under-trump-administration-plan>;
accessed 7/14/2025; Lowell-DB\]

[The [State Department is firing more than **1,300**
employees]{.mark}]{.underline} on Friday in line with a dramatic
reorganization plan unveiled by the Trump administration earlier this
year, a move that critics say [will **damage America's global
leadership** and efforts to counter threats abroad]{.underline}.

The department is sending layoff notices to 1,107 civil servants and 246
foreign service officers with domestic assignments in the United States,
said a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity to discuss personnel matters ahead of individual notices being
emailed to affected employees.

[Foreign service officers]{.underline} affected will be placed
immediately on administrative leave for 120 days, after which they
[will]{.underline} formally [lose their jobs]{.underline}, according to
an internal notice obtained by The Associated Press. For most affected
civil servants, the separation period is 60 days, it said.

"In connection with the departmental reorganization ... the department
is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,"
the notice says. "Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to
affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices
where considerable efficiencies may be found from centralization or
consolidation of functions and responsibilities."

While lauded by President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio
and their Republican allies as overdue and necessary to make the
department leaner, more nimble and more efficient, [the cuts have
been]{.underline} roundly [criticized by current and former diplomats
who say they [will weaken U.S. influence and]{.mark} its [ability to
counter]{.mark}]{.underline} existing and emerging
[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad.

The layoffs are part of big changes to State Department work

The Trump administration has pushed to reshape American diplomacy and
worked aggressively to shrink the size of the federal government,
including mass dismissals as part of moves to dismantle whole
departments like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the
Education Department.

USAID, the six-decade-old foreign assistance agency, was absorbed into
the State Department last week after the administration dramatically
slashed foreign aid funding.

A recent ruling by the Supreme Court cleared the way for the layoffs to
start, while lawsuits challenging the legality of the cuts continue to
play out. The department had formally advised staffers on Thursday that
it would be sending layoff notices to some of them soon. The job cuts
are large but considerably less than many had feared.

Rubio said officials took "a very deliberate step to reorganize the
State Department to be more efficient and more focused."

"It's not a consequence of trying to get rid of people. But if you close
the bureau, you don't need those positions," he told reporters Thursday
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he's attending the annual Association
of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum. "Understand that some of
these are positions that are being eliminated, not people."

He said some of the cuts will be unfilled positions or those that are
about to be vacant because an employee took an early retirement.

Critics say the changes will hurt U.S. standing abroad

The American Academy of Diplomacy, an association that includes hundreds
of former senior diplomats, said the State Department layoffs "will
[**seriously undermine** the ability of our government to understand,
explain, and respond to a complex and increasingly contested
world]{.underline}."

"[[At a time when the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces
**unprecedented** challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} from strategic
competitors and adversaries, ongoing conflicts in Central Europe,
Africa, and the Middle East, and emerging security threats, the decision
to gut the Department of State's institutional knowledge and operational
capacity is an act of vandalism," the organization said in a statement
last week before the cuts were announced.

It added that Rubio's explanations for the cuts are "disingenuous,
pernicious, and false."

Michael Rigas, the department's deputy secretary for management and
resources, said in a notice Thursday that staffers would be informed
"soon" if they were being laid off.

"First and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and
service to the United States," he said.

"Once notifications have taken place, the Department will enter the
final stage of its reorganization and focus its attention on delivering
results-driven diplomacy," Rigas added.

The State Department is undergoing a big reorganization

In late May, the State Department notified Congress of an updated
reorganization plan, proposing cuts to programs beyond what had been
revealed earlier by Rubio and an 18% reduction of staff in the U.S.,
even higher than the 15% initially floated in April.

The restructuring has been driven in part by the need to find a new home
for the remaining functions of USAID, which was an early target of the
Trump administration and then-aide Elon Musk's Department of Government
Efficiency.

The State Department is planning to eliminate some divisions tasked with
oversight of America's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan, including
an office focused on resettling Afghan nationals who worked alongside
the U.S. military.

A letter that the department had sent to Congress noted that [the
[reorganization will affect more than 300 bureaus]{.mark} and
offices]{.underline}, saying it is eliminating divisions it describes as
doing unclear or overlapping work. It says Rubio believes "effective
modern diplomacy requires streamlining this bloated bureaucracy."

That letter was clear that the reorganization also is intended to
eliminate programs --- particularly those related to refugees and
immigration, as well as human rights and democracy promotion --- that
the Trump administration believes have become ideologically driven in a
way that is incompatible with its priorities and policies.

The American Foreign Service Association, the union that represents
diplomats, urged the State Department last month to hold off on job
cuts.

Notices for a reduction in force, which would not only lay off employees
but eliminate positions altogether, "should be a last resort,"
association President Tom Yazdgerdi said. "[Disrupting the Foreign
Service like this [puts national interests at risk]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- and Americans everywhere will bear the consequences."

The great international problems of the day all require diplomacy.
Whether it is finding a way to end the war in Ukraine, address climate
change, prevent a war between the United States and China, or develop
shared rules for how artificial intelligence should be managed, the
process of countries talking to one another to find agreements is
paramount. Yet, [the ability of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to
conduct [diplomacy has atrophied]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While [[[diplomats

stagnation](https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-state?fy=2023),
and political attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} on the department before and
after the Trump era have [led to a **[weakened diplomatic
structure]{.mark}**]{.underline} unable to lead on major international
agreements.

Yet, the decline of US diplomacy is not simply due to budgets or
partisan attacks. There is an overarching cultural force that privileges
military might over diplomatic efforts. [Proposals for negotiation and
compromise are rarely well received by the American public]{.underline},
while threats to use force when other countries fail to comply with US
demands receive more attention and praise. The result is that the
ability of the United States to conduct diplomacy, even when it seeks to
lead diplomatic efforts, is severely limited at a time when diplomacy is
desperately needed.

This month's Reimagining US Grand Strategy roundtable focused on the
structural factors that have undermined US diplomacy. Participants
highlighted several issues, from the tight restrictions put on embassy
staff traveling around the countries they are stationed in to the
domestic cultural impediments to support extensive diplomatic efforts.
There was widespread agreement that the [United States was caught [in a

interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Three participants shared their views on
what needs to change to help address the diplomatic deficit in US
foreign policy.

### UQ---Military---2AC

#### US Military is cooked:

#### **1. [COLBY]{.underline}\-\--He decks Pentagon effectiveness**

**Detsch et al, 7/8** \[Jack Detsch, Nahal Toosi, Paul McLeary, and Joe
Gould; Defense Reporters at Politico citing Trump administration and
Pentagon officials; 7/8/2025; Politico; "Pentagon policy chief's rouge
decisions have irked US allies and the Trump administration";

accessed 7/14/2025; Lowell-DB\]

[Elbridge Colby]{.underline} spent the last several years in Washington
making a name for himself as an experienced, restraint-minded foreign
policy leader eager to focus the U.S. military away from Europe and
toward the Indo-Pacific.

But since joining the second Trump administration as the Pentagon's top
policy chief, Colby [has made a series of **rapid-fire** moves that have
**blindsided**]{.underline} parts of [the White House and
frustrated]{.underline} several of America's foreign
[allies]{.underline}, according to seven people familiar with the
situation. All were granted anonymity to speak freely about Trump
administration dynamics.

Flanked by a team of handpicked policy experts and staff from Capitol
Hill, Colby has gotten out ahead of the administration on several major
foreign policy decisions.

He prompted last week's decision, [first reported by
POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/02/ukraine-weapons-freeze-elbridge-colby-00438156),
[to halt shipments of some air defense missiles to Ukraine, [which
caught many Trump allies and lawmakers off
guard](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/02/ukraine-weapons-freeze-elbridge-colby-00438156).]{.underline}
This week, President Donald [Trump]{.underline} said he would reverse
the decision to pause the weapons [[**but claimed he did not know** who
had approved
it](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/shorts/trump-says-he-doesn-t-know-who-ordered-ukraine-weapons-shipment-pause-242860613697).]{.underline}

[Colby also surprised top
officials](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/07/02/trumps-national-security-council-is-flailing-00436700) at
the State Department and the National Security Council in June when [he
decided to review America's submarine pact with Australia and the
U.K.]{.underline}

"[He is pissing off]{.underline} just about [**everyone**]{.underline} I
know [inside the administration]{.underline}," said one person familiar
with the situation. "[They all view him as the guy who's going to **make
the U.S. do less**]{.underline} in the world in general."

And in conversations with defense counterparts from Britain and Japan in
recent months, Colby's hard-charging style has caused serious dustups.

"[He has]{.underline} basically [decided]{.underline} that he's going to
be the intellectual driving force behind a kind of neo-isolationism that
believes [that the United States should act more alone, that allies and
friends are]{.underline} kind of encumbering," said a person familiar
with the Trump administration dynamics.

Colby did not respond to a request for comment.

William Martin, communications director to Vice President JD Vance,
called Colby "a consummate professional, an experienced national
security official and a reliable team player" who is "wholly committed
to President Trump's America First foreign policy agenda."

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said Colby is doing exactly what
would be expected of his job. "The entire purpose of Undersecretary
Colby's job is to provide policy recommendations to Secretary Hegseth,
and his advice has proved to be invaluable," he wrote in an email.

Parnell added there is "zero daylight" between Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth and Colby.

When the British defense team came to the Pentagon in June and spoke
about the U.K.'s decision to [send an aircraft carrier to
Asia](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/07/a-look-at-the-uk-led-carrier-strike-group-in-singapore) on
a routine deployment, Colby interjected with a brusque comment.

"He basically asked them, 'Is it too late to call it back?'" said the
person familiar with Trump administration dynamics. "Because we don't
want you there." A second person familiar with the meeting confirmed
this account.

The British team on the other side of the table "were just shocked," the
first person added. "He was basically saying, 'You have no business
being in the Indo-Pacific.'"

[Colby has]{.underline} also [irked allies by pushing them too hard to
**boost defense spending**]{.underline} --- [or telling
them]{.underline} [to]{.underline} simply [**get out** of America's
way]{.underline}. "DOD has been telling a European partner that we don't
need the Europeans to be doing anything \[in the Indo-Pacific\]," said
one U.S. official familiar with the conversations.

In the spring, Japanese officials believed the Trump administration
might push them for a modest increase in defense spending. Initially,
[Colby publicly called on Japan to spend "[at least 3 percent of
GDP](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-defence-budget-prioritises-quality-over-gdp-ratio-spokesperson-reacts-2025-03-05/) on
defense as soon as possible]{.underline}," which [angered Japanese Prime
Minister Shigeru Ishiba]{.underline}. But [that number]{.underline} soon
[increased to]{.underline} a [[much steeper target of 5
percent](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Indo-Pacific/US-wants-Asian-allies-to-spend-5-of-GDP-on-defense-Pentagon-says),]{.underline}
which reportedly [contributed to [the collapse of
plans](https://www.ft.com/content/53f646e7-b4e7-4bf4-8d5d-7142b4460080)]{.underline} [for
a high-level meeting between Hegseth,]{.underline} Secretary of State
Marco [Rubio and their Japanese counterparts]{.underline}.

"The Japanese were very frustrated," said a person familiar with the
talks. "They thought that they were agreeing to at least negotiate on
the basis of 3 or 3.5 percent. Then Colby, all of a sudden, got DOD to
say 5, and the [Japanese got angry, because that's not what they just
agreed to."]{.underline}

The incident caused heartburn within Japan's ruling party, with
officials worried about triggering a domestic political backlash ahead
of a sensitive election, the person added.

[The hawkish wing of the Republican Party has expressed concerns that
Colby']{.underline}s "shoot first and ask questions later" [approach is
sapping Trump's foreign policy]{.underline} of its strength at a key
moment.

"The president's leadership at NATO and his decision to strike Iran gave
Russia and China good reason to fear America's resolve," [said a senior
GOP aide. "But Colby has]{.underline} just [undercut the president and
squandered his boss' leverage."]{.underline}

an Army National Guard officer from 2002 to 2021, with combat
deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, [leading the Pentagon is
a]{.underline} vastly different [challenge.]{.underline} The DOD is a
behemoth, with close to [3.4 million civilian and military
personnel](https://demographics.militaryonesource.mil/chapter-1-total-military-force/) and
an [\$850 billion budget](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61017) for
fiscal year 2025. Its operations span more than 80 countries and
include maintaining the nuclear arsenal and delivering disaster
relief. [The scale and complexity of the Pentagon's operations demand
leaders who can unify a vast workforce, manage intricate systems, and
balance military effectiveness with fiscal responsibility.]{.underline}

As the second-in-command to the commander in chief, the secretary of
defense must also lead the nation in ensuring that the United States'
military operations are conducted with the highest consideration for
ethical and legal standards. The secretary must ensure adherence to U.S.
and international law in all military or defense intelligence operations
and must be willing to seek accountability when violations occur.

[Hegseth has no record of managing a body even a fraction of this scale
or import.]{.underline} Beyond his service in the National Guard, he
has [led](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history) small
nonprofit organizations and has been an on-air cable news host.
[Hegseth]{.underline} has asserted that
he [[believes](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/pete-hegseth-book-attacks-nato-alliances) [U.S.
troops need not respect the Geneva
Conventions](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/pete-hegseth-book-attacks-nato-alliances)]{.underline}---laws
that detail how soldiers and civilians should act and be treated during
war---and he has [[supported illegal torture
techniques]{.underline}](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/hegseth-controversial-views-military-kfile/index.html) such
as waterboarding. He [[lobbied for
impunity](https://time.com/7176342/pete-hegseth-donald-trump-pardon-war-crimes-military/) for
service members accused of war crimes]{.underline}, including former
Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, whose own platoon courageously [spoke
up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/us/navy-seals-edward-gallagher-video.html) about
his violations of the laws of war. These positions are shocking for any
military officer, let alone the secretary of defense, and put America's
deployed service members at risk of reprisal.

Hegseth [lacks the necessary strategic vision for America's defense
challenge]{.underline}

The DOD operates on a 30-year planning horizon, requiring strategic
foresight to predict and counter emerging threats. Today, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [faces a challenging and
evolving security environment]{.underline}. Peer and near-peer rivals,
led by China and Russia,
are [testing](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/R43838.pdf) America's
military edge and reshaping the global balance of power. Rapidly
evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence are already
transforming threat landscapes, and [satellite
infrastructure](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-29/us-sees-china-s-threat-from-space-growing-at-breathtaking-pace) [could
outpace](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-29/us-sees-china-s-threat-from-space-growing-at-breathtaking-pace?embedded-checkout=true) [U.S.
capabilities in
space](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3843526/military-experts-highlight-space-opportunities-threats-at-aspen-conference/).
Nuclear nonproliferation will present a key challenge in the coming
years. Against this backdrop, the Commission on the National Defense
Strategy in July 2024
bluntly [assessed ](https://www.rand.org/nsrd/projects/NDS-commission.html)that
["the U.S. military lacks both the capabilities and the capacity
required to be confident it can deter and prevail in
combat."]{.underline}

To meet this moment, the next secretary of defense must be a visionary
who can anticipate threats; provide leadership to the joint force during
moments of profound change; and oversee procurement, personnel, and
operations strategies. Leading the DOD will require confronting the
rapid evolution of warfare,
from [hypersonic](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/weapons/R45811.pdf) weapons to
artificial intelligence, and aligning America's military capabilities
with its strategic goals.

Yet [Hegseth]{.underline}'s public career shows no evidence of his
ability---or interest---in addressing these urgent challenges. Instead,
he appears [more interested in fueling culture wars]{.underline}.
Hegseth has attacked diversity in the ranks, [vowing to eliminate
recruitment and retention
programs](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191941/pete-hegseth-defense-department-dei) and
to purge officers he considers to be "woke," such as Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. This approach is
particularly dangerous for the DOD; the military's effectiveness depends
on its ability to remain above the fray and stay focused solely on
safeguarding the nation. Instead of addressing pressing national
security issues, Hegseth is focusing on cultural battles and risks
distracting the department from its primary mission: safeguarding the
nation.

Hegseth [has a proven track record of financial
mismanagement]{.underline}

Managing a near trillion-dollar taxpayer-funded budget requires
exemplary commitment to fiscal responsibility. Unfortunately, in
November 2024, [the Pentagon failed to pass an audit]{.underline} for
the seventh year in a row. In 2020, the Government Accountability Office
([GAO) found that the DOD [wasted \$37 billion in procurement delays
alone](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-117shrg45251/html/CHRG-117shrg45251.htm)]{.underline}.
A 2021 GAO
report [found](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106341#:~:text=The%20Army%20identified%20two%20weapon%20systems%E2%80%94CH%2D47F%20Block,cost%20estimate%20for%20the%20system%20(Category%20A);) that
40 percent of major weapons programs exceeded cost estimates by at least
25 percent, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. The next secretary of
defense must streamline processes; commit to and oversee financial
management reform; and navigate and steward good relations with Congress
as it conducts oversight.

[Hegseth lacks the requisite financial and strategic management
skills]{.underline}. He served in leadership roles of the small
nonprofit organizations Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for
America from 2008 to 2016. Tax filings for both of these
organizations [show
ledgers](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pete-hegseth-concerned-veterans-for-america-jessie-jane-duff/) with
higher expenditures than revenue during his leadership tenure,
and *The New
Yorker* has [reported](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history?_sp=97379332-6b57-472b-aff4-a786652df6fe.1733146677417) that
serious [allegations of financial mismanagement]{.underline} contributed
to his departure from both these roles.

Hegseth's positions on women and LGBTQI+ service members harm military
readiness

In a November 7, 2024, podcast interview with Shawn Ryan,
Hegseth [declared](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-nominee-for-defense-secretary-reignites-debate-over-allowing-women-to-fight-on-the-front-lines),
"I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles.
It hasn't made us more effective. Hasn't made us more lethal. Has made
fighting more complicated." Hegseth has repeatedly attacked pro-LGBTQI+
policy,
openly [opposing](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/12/politics/pete-hegseth-gay-trans-troops-marxist-agenda/index.html) both
the original unprecedented "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law and its repeal,
which allowed all service members to be judged on the basis of their
military training, readiness for deployment, and integrity; Hegseth said
these policies prioritized a social agenda over military readiness.
Positions like these are counterproductive. The military's readiness
depends on leveraging its full talent pool, and [research
consistently](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1026-1.html) shows
that diverse teams perform better in high-stakes environments. While
Hegseth has [walked
back](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/13/hegseth-women-gays-military-comments-walkback-00194156) these
remarks in the face of heated criticism after Trump announced his
nomination, these regressive positions call into question Hegseth's
commitment to a diverse armed forces and civilian workforce.

Further, [reports](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pete-hegseths-drinking-worried-colleagues-fox-news-sources-tell-nbc-ne-rcna181471) of
alleged on-air intoxication during his Fox News tenure and [allegations

cast serious doubt on Hegseth's judgment and discipline. Sexual assault
and sexual harassment continue to plague military institutions. In 2023,
the
Pentagon [reported a](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assaults-rise-military-academies-west-point-annapolis-rcna74371)n
all-time high rate of sexual assault at its service academies, and
Pentagon surveys in 2021 [revealed a 25 percent
in](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/03/military-sexual-assault-prevention-efforts)crease
in sexual assaults from 2018 and "a near total lack of prevention
specialists."

Hegseth's positions on women and LGBTQI+ service members are not only
antiquated and regressive, they are particularly problematic at a time
when the military [is
struggling](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106551.pdf) to meet
recruitment and retention goals. The high level of service of women and
LGBTQI+ service members is not an item for debate; it is a measure to be
recognized and supported, and creating a hostile or unsafe environment
for these service members undermines military readiness. The secretary
of defense must foster a diverse fighting force and ensure that all
service members, no matter their gender or sexual orientation, are able
to serve the country safely and with support and respect from their
leaders.

Conclusion

The consequences of Hegseth's appointment would reverberate far beyond
the Pentagon. [His lack of credibility and diplomatic acumen threatens
to undermine alliances, embolden adversaries, and weaken America's
standing on the global stage]{.underline}---all outcomes that raise
risks to the safety of the American people.

America's armed forces deserve leadership that is competent, credible,
and focused on the challenges ahead. The American people deserve a
secretary of defense who will prioritize an effective and accountable
Department of Defense ready to keep the nation safe against rapidly
evolving threats. Hegseth is not that leader. His confirmation is [a
risk the nation **cannot afford**]{.underline}.

### Military Presence Bad---2AC

#### Taiwan is not key to US interests and invasion doesn't escalate but US military presence causes first strike

**Bandow 25** --- Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute,
formerly worked as a special Assistant to the President during the
Reagan administration; Editor of the political magazine Inquiry,
graduated with a Bachelor\'s degree in economics from Florida State
University, 2025 (\"To Protect Taiwan, Don't Prepare to Defend It,\"
CATO Institute, May 29th, Available Online at
https://www.cato.org/commentary/protect-taiwan-dont-prepare-defend-it,
Accessed 07-15-2025)

Virtually every American security analyst reflexively insists that the
U.S. also must be ready to fight on behalf of Taipei. Indeed, [despite
**[Washington's formal policy of "strategic
ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline}," former President Joe Biden repeatedly
stated that he would defend the island state. His administration
increased the U.S. military presence in Taiwan, stationing several
hundred American personnel in the country---more than ten times the
number reported last year---and cooperating in other ways. Mark
Montgomery of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies recently told
Congress, "If we're going to give them billions of dollars in
assistance, sell them tens of billions of dollars' worth of U.S. gear,
it makes sense that we'd be over there training and working." He
advocated doubling the U.S. military's presence.

[[The U.S. should defuse tensions with Beijing to prevent war]{.mark}
over the faraway island.]{.underline}

The political pressure on any president to intervene in a conflict
between Beijing and Taipei would be strong, as Jennifer Kavanagh of
Defense Priorities and Stephen Wertheim of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace observed in Foreign Affairs. "By staying out, the
president could expect to be blamed not only for permitting the economic
meltdown that China's invasion would trigger but also for losing Taiwan
after a decades-long battle of wills between Washington and Beijing over
the island's future," they wrote.

[Moreover, [America's formal armed presence]{.mark}, increased military
cooperation, regional force build-up, [and]{.mark} continuing military
[threats would tempt the PRC]{.mark}, if it decided to act against
Taipei, [to launch]{.mark} a [preemptive strike.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Oddly, Taiwan has become an argument for ramping up America's Ukrainian
proxy war. Observed The Daily Telegraph: "Like Ukrainians, \[the
Taiwanese\] live under constant threat from a neighbor that believes it
has a right to their territory. They also rely on Western support to
keep that threat at bay." Taipei's foreign minister, Joseph Wu, argued
that China would treat a U.S. withdrawal from Ukraine as a victory. He
warned that China would think: "OK, since Russia could do that, we can
do that as well."

In fact, Washington's Ukraine policy of weapons not war may undermine
U.S. threats to intervene militarily on behalf of Taipei. The U.S. and
its allies refused to fight for Ukraine even though they could deploy
substantial ground and air forces against Russia. Intervening on
Taiwan's behalf would be far more difficult. NATO would play no
meaningful combat role, and even America's Asian allies might remain
aloof---South Korea very likely, Japan and Australia uncertain. Which
would greatly impede U.S. operations.

Trump so far has refused to commit to defend Taiwan. [His criticisms of
Taipei's military and trade practices suggest he would be reluctant to
jump into the abyss against the PRC]{.underline}. As a result, observed
the Telegraph, in Taiwan "a sense of unease has turned into panic."
Predictably, the island's political and business leaders "are scrambling
to appease the U.S. president." Instead, they should concentrate on
developing Taipei's military capabilities. Its failure to deploy a
serious military and the Taiwanese people's reluctance to defend
themselves have been truly shocking. Far more brazenly than the
Europeans and Japanese, the island's residents presume Washington will
risk nuclear war on their behalf.

Maintaining sufficient military force and projecting it thousands of
miles to contain the PRC within its borders would consume ever more of
the U.S. military budget. The consequences of combat between Washington
and Beijing would be serious and most likely catastrophic. Even a purely
conventional conflict would look more like the Korean War than the Iraq
War. And the outcome would be much worse if the U.S. homeland became a
battlefield and nuclear weapons magnified the destruction.

The outcome of multiple war games suggests that neither combatant could
expect victory, and much would depend on the willingness of America's
allies to intervene. In these games, Washington often loses. Even when
Beijing fails to conquer the island, the officially victorious U.S.
typically loses a couple carriers, hundreds of aircraft, and thousands
of personnel. And these exercises often stop before nuclear weapons are
used, yet neither side could easily accept defeat and the temptation to
escalate would be enormous. Nor would it be enough for America to
triumph. If thwarted, China likely would immediately begin preparing for
a rematch. The U.S. might have to defend Taiwan continually---and for
decades.

Such a policy deserves a serious debate involving the American people,
who would be doing the paying and dying. They felt betrayed by the Iraq
War, in which U.S. casualties, though tragic, were modest compared to
numbers in past conflicts. In a battle between China and America the
economic costs would be far higher, and the number of casualties would
be many times greater. Imagine if the U.S. homeland came under
attack---nuclear attack. Hawkish policymakers should level with the
American people and allow the latter to decide if they support such a
policy.

[Any map demonstrates that [Taiwan is not vital]{.mark} for U.S.
security]{.underline}. Washington enjoys military dominance off the
PRC's coast, but that is useful, not existential. Possession of Taiwan
would aid the Chinese military, but not fundamentally transform
America's strategic position. [Chinese control would discomfit Japan and
the Philippines, but [little suggests that Beijing desires to]{.mark} or
even could [stage a Pacific blitzkrieg]{.mark}. U.S. sovereignty,
security, prosperity, and liberty all would remain secure irrespective
of Taipei's fate.]{.underline}

[[Another claim]{.mark}, repeated by the Telegraph, [is]{.mark} that
"Taiwan is the crucible for the production of the world's most advanced
semiconductors and, as a result, a full-blown war on the island would
threaten a global economic meltdown. This threat of mutually assured
economic destruction has provided what analysts have dubbed a '[silicon
shield']{.mark}]{.underline}---it is in the U.S.'s interests to protect
the island." [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, for centuries the West
engaged in destructive warfare for mercantile purposes. [[Taiwan's chip
factories are not worth inaugurating]{.mark} mass slaughter, regional
chaos, and [nuclear war]{.mark}. Loss of semiconductor production would
be costly. A Sino-American conflict would be beyond
expensive.]{.underline}

[Indeed, [Taiwan's]{.mark} dominant [semiconductor]{.mark} chip industry
[should be]{.mark} an [incentive against American intervention]{.mark}
since war]{.underline}, not a Chinese takeover, poses the greatest
threat. [[Even]{.mark} successful [defense of Taiwan would]{.mark}
likely [ruin the industry]{.mark}, whether inadvertently by the winner
or intentionally by the loser.]{.underline} As for guaranteeing access
to semiconductor chips, [[Washington already is promoting]{.mark} a mix
of increased [domestic production]{.mark} and friend-shoring, both of
which are far better responses to the threat than war.]{.underline}

Moreover, if China acts militarily, it will do so despite the
deleterious economic consequences. Few wars make economic sense.
Observed Sean King of Park Strategies: "The whole population of Taiwan
is basically about the size of Shanghai. If the mainland goes for
Taiwan, it's not going to be for economics. It's really going to be
about nationalism and strategy."

[[Taiwan is a]{.mark} vibrant [democracy]{.mark}, [but that]{.mark} also
[doesn't justify]{.mark} the [U.S. going to]{.mark} a [war]{.mark} with
China]{.underline}. Argued the Hudson Institute's Jason Hsu: "During
Biden's administration the discussions were value-based, about allyship,
partnership or even democracy." Yet bringing destruction upon the
American republic and sacrificing American lives would be a high price
to pay for protecting Taiwanese democracy. [Moreover, [expected U.S.
belligerence would encourage the PRC to preempt]{.mark} Washington with
a broader and more savage attack.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, Americans need not choose between abandoning and defending
Taiwan. Washington should pursue a dialogue with Beijing directed at
defusing the military situation in the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. should
press mutual restraint, with reductions to America's regional military
activity, Washington's political and military contacts with Taipei,
Beijing's coercive military operations and threats, and Taipei's
independence-oriented diplomatic activity. The goal of such a diplomatic
initiative, Kavanagh and Wertheim explained, is that China "would see
the threat subside as Washington takes greater care not to publicly
challenge the legitimacy of Beijing's territorial claim and aspiration
for eventual unification."

The U.S. also should organize allied plans for economic and political
retaliation in the event of Chinese aggression. The commercial
consequences would be especially great for China, which is highly
dependent on international trade. A failed attack also would likely end
Xi's rule and perhaps that of the Chinese Communist Party.

Kavanagh and Wertheim also suggest a broader strategy to empower Taiwan
by promoting the island's ability to defend itself, which "allows the
U.S. to assist from a distance, and keeps the U.S. position in Asia
intact regardless of how a cross-strait conflict concludes." In
particular, Washington should sell those weapons, such as anti-ship
mines and missiles, most useful to prevent a Chinese attack. More
important to America, as well as much more defensible against Beijing,
are Japan and other Asian states. The U.S. should encourage them to
bolster their militaries, including by increasing intra-Asian
cooperation, especially with India. Moreover, threatened states should
consider acquiring nuclear weapons, controversial though that would be.
So-called extended deterrence, with the U.S. threatening to fight
nuclear war against the enemies of its allies, is a terrible game of
chicken made much riskier by China's ongoing nuclear build-up. Far
better that allied states control their own defense destinies.

[While Taiwan may be the most dangerous spot on earth, Kavanagh and
Wertheim urge U.S. officials to downplay the island state's
significance, rejecting "the [misguided idea that]{.mark} the **[United
States' survival and prosperity turn on Taiwan's political
status]{.mark}**." America need not commit potential national suicide on
Taipei's behalf.]{.underline}

[Both the [U.S. and PRC]{.mark} should determine to [avoid war over the
island's status]{.mark}. That would require them to compromise and
moderate their ambitions. Control of Taipei does not justify a clash
between the two most important and powerful countries on earth, armed
with nuclear weapons and capable of destroying each other. Only very
rarely is war necessary. And not in this case. Especially by
America.]{.underline}

### Mil Presence Bad---1AR

#### Trade war makes war more likely and drones give Taiwan independent military capabilities which increases risk of invasion

**Mastro 25** --- Oriana Skylar Mastro, Center Fellow at the Freeman
Spogli Institute for International Studies and Courtesy Assistant
Professor of Political Science at Stanford University, formerly worked
as a assistant Professor of Security Studies at Georgetown University,
graduated with a B.A. in East Asian Studies from Stanford University,
2025 (\"The Taiwan Tightrope,\" Foreign Affairs, May 20th, Available
Online at
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/taiwan/taiwan-tightrope-mastro?, Accessed
07-15-2025)

[The [trade war could make]{.mark} a shooting [war]{.mark} seem [more
appealing]{.mark} to Beijing.]{.underline}

So far, the U.S. military has stopped short of seeking such changes
because they are politically sensitive both at home and abroad: host
countries worry they might become greater targets of Chinese aggression,
and some U.S. policymakers worry that such moves could cross a redline
for Beijing. But if Washington follows a few principles, such
improvements will not necessarily provoke Chinese aggression. [First,
the [United States should not make]{.mark} a public announcement or a
[spectacle of enhancements]{.mark} to its military force posture. As
U.S. forces increase their activities around and in Taiwan, be they
joint exercises, freedom of navigation exercises, or training, U.S.
officials should refrain from making statements to which China might
feel forced to respond]{.underline}. Military upgrades should be
concealed or downplayed until they are fielded to minimize the
likelihood that China will effectively launch a coercive campaign
against their deployment.

[[Bolstering Taiwan's independent military capabilities]{.mark}---a
long-standing U.S. policy---[presents]{.mark} an arguably even [bigger
risk of provocation]{.mark}. Beijing worries that Taiwan will become so
certain of its ability to protect itself that it will consider declaring
independence]{.underline}. In recent years, Taiwan has acquired defense
capabilities with the aim of deterring potential Chinese aggression. It
has bought asymmetric warfare systems, such as coastal defense cruise
missiles and HIMARS rocket systems, moving away from traditional
high-cost platforms such as submarines. It has also pledged that its
defense budget will exceed three percent of GDP in 2025 and that it will
prioritize precision-guided munitions, air defense upgrades,
command-and-control systems, equipment for reserve forces, and
anti-drone technologies. These are sensible steps, but they also pose a
risk: [the [less Taiwan depends on U.S. assistance]{.mark}, the more
China's leaders worry that Taiwan's president, Lai Ching-te, [could be
emboldened to declare independence]{.mark} unilaterally---further
incentivizing Beijing to invade sooner rather than later.]{.underline}

[[To prevent deterrence from morphing into provocation]{.mark}, the
United States should [provide]{.mark} Taiwan [mainly with capabilities
that rely on continued U.S. support]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2024, for
example, the Biden administration approved the sale of three National
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems to Taiwan in a deal that was
brokered to increase U.S.-Taiwanese interoperability. In other words,
this system was designed to function best in tandem with U.S. support.
The United States should continue to encourage Taiwan's asymmetric
defense, particularly by prioritizing the speedy and reliable delivery
of systems such as the highly mobile precision HIMARS rockets; advanced
air defense missile systems such as the NASAMS; and antiship missiles
such as the RGM-84L-4 Block II Harpoon. But Washington should also
highlight the aspects of Taiwan's military capacity that are linked to
the United States, reassuring Beijing that the island cannot act alone.

### Drones Not Key---2AC

#### Drones are not effective by themselves, independently there is already strong Taiwanese rhetoric of the need for drones and they are already developing them

**Chiou 23** --- Linus Chiou, graduated with a Physics and History from
University of Virginia, 2023 (\"Debunking drone misconceptions,\" Taipei
Times, February 4th, Available Online at
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/02/04/2003793680?,
Accessed 07-15-2025)

Nevertheless, [the [sentiment that]{.mark} developing [uncrewed systems
would be]{.mark} the [miracle cure]{.mark} to all of Taiwan's defense
woes [is]{.mark} still [very much prevalent]{.mark} among those who have
a surface-level understanding of military hardware]{.underline}. Taiwan
People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) suggested that the
procurement of F-16V jets is a waste of money. Alternatively, Ko
suggested that a much more logical and affordable option would be to
allocate funds to the development of uncrewed assets.

[There are [no uncrewed aerial systems]{.mark} that [can replace modern
jets]{.mark}. Armed drones, like General Atomics' MQ-1 Predator, attack
ground targets primarily in low-intensity airspace, where the enemy does
not possess a robust air defense network. While the Predator had
considerable success in the global fight against terrorism, NATO's Joint
Air Power Competence Centre concluded that "current systems are not yet
ready to survive in non-permissive or hostile a8ir
environments."]{.underline}

Even though Predator drones can perform a variety of mission sets ---
including surveillance, reconnaissance and close air support --- [[they
cannot engage enemy fighters.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While some countries have invested in the development of drones that
specialize in air-to-air combat, most of these projects are premature.
In 2021, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced
the LongShot program, which is in preliminary design review. The
LongShot would be a drone that is carried by crewed aircraft, but could
also carry missiles. The drone would be released by fighters during
combat to increase engagement range. These drones are designed to be
platforms that support crewed fighters, not fully replace them.
[[Multirole fighters]{.mark} such as the F-16V [still have a
rol8e]{.mark} in combat for decades to come.]{.underline}

Furthermore, most drones used in combat during the Russo-Ukrainian war
are small inexpensive ones with limited range. Procuring these drones
would improve Taiwan's asymmetrical capabilities on the tactical scale.
[[Taiwan is already in the process of incorporating more
drones]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the Chien Hsiang anti-radiation
drone. Nevertheless, the Russo-Ukrainian war shows that infantry units
are still at the core of mounting an effective defense against an
invading force. [[Drones provide a supporting role to the
infantry]{.underline}]{.mark}, which still conducts the majority of the
fighting. Even with the much-publicized Iranian Shahed-136 drone attacks
on Ukrainian cities, these "wonder weapons" alone are unlikely to
destroy Ukraine's will to fight or shift the tide of the war.

Jaw and Ko think that it [[would be easy for Taiwan to develop
next-generation drones]{.mark} on its own, without technical assistance
from the US]{.underline}. Behind their rhetoric is the baseless belief
that the sole goal of the Pentagon is to profit from Taiwan through arms
sales. Therefore, they argue that Taiwan should aim to be completely
self-reliant in its defense procurement.

### Tradeoff Good---2AC

#### We'll explicitly concede that the aff trades off resources from defending Taiwan, that's good:

#### Taiwan is not worth the consequences of the war \-\-- neither China nor the U.S. gain advantage from controlling the island

PRICING IN WORLD WAR III

The United States rightly expends considerable resources to dissuade
China from using coercion to control Taiwan. If China were to seize
Taiwan, the United States would suffer significant military, economic,
and reputational setbacks. China would gain a new foothold from which to
project power across East Asia, complicating U.S. military operations in
the region. Beijing could disrupt trade routes in the western Pacific,
rattling the global economy. U.S. allies would have a new reason to
question Washington's commitment to their security. The repercussions
would be greatest, of course, for the people of Taiwan, who would lose
their vibrant democracy.

Nevertheless, for the foreseeable future, [the benefits of preserving
Taiwan's de facto self-rule do not warrant the enormous human and
economic costs of a U.S.-Chinese war]{.underline}. The United States'
vital [interest lies in preventing China from attaining untrammeled
regional hegemony in Asia]{.underline}. With such dominance, China could
project large-scale military power into the Western Hemisphere or cut
the United States off from Asia's dynamic economic markets. But
[controlling Taiwan would not]{.underline}, in itself, transform China
into a hegemon. The United States would remain capable of rallying a
counterbalancing coalition to impede any potential Chinese bid for
political and military supremacy in Asia.

For one thing, [the military advantages]{.underline} China would reap
from taking Taiwan [would not be that profound, and the United States
and its allies would have time to adjust]{.underline}. [Beijing could
use control of the island to expand the reach of its missiles, air
defenses, radars, and maritime and air surveillance
systems]{.underline}, allowing the People's Liberation Army to operate
farther from China's coast and more easily hold at risk U.S. military
assets, including bases in Guam and vessels near Japan and the
Philippines. [But the PLA's weapons can already reach these U.S.
targets]{.underline}, so adding a few hundred more miles to their range
would make only a marginal difference. China's undersea gains would be
similarly modest and unlikely to offset U.S. advantages. Seizing Taiwan
would allow China to dock submarines in the deepwater ports off Taiwan's
eastern coast, which would extend their range and enable them to avoid
some U.S. underwater sensors in the Miyako and Luzon Straits. They might
not evade U.S. monitoring entirely, however, because satellites or sound
surveillance in the region could probably detect them. Moreover, China
may, in time, develop quieter submarines, and these could avoid U.S.
detection without being launched from Taiwan.

Such [limited operational gains would not give China the ability to
bring about a dramatic regional expansion]{.underline}.
[Despite]{.underline} the [fears]{.underline} of some in Tokyo and
Manila, [China would still face formidable obstacles to seizing outlying
territories belonging to Japan or the Philippines]{.underline}---most of
which are farther from Taiwan than Taiwan is from China---let alone more
distant and populous islands, such as Okinawa or Kyushu in Japan or
Luzon in the Philippines. Furthermore, [it would take China years to
build the infrastructure needed to use Taiwan as a base for military
operations]{.underline}; [the United States and its partners would have
plenty of time to prepare additional defenses]{.underline}. In short,
control of the island would hardly overturn the military balance in the
region. Countries threatened by China's rise have to invest in security
measures no matter what happens in and around Taiwan.

[If military considerations do not necessitate the direct U.S. defense
of Taiwan, neither do the economic stakes]{.underline}. National
security officials who favor a strong U.S. commitment to Taiwan
frequently cite their concern that China could commandeer high-tech
assets on the island. Taiwan produces about 90 percent of the world's
most advanced chips, largely through the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company. They argue that if Beijing gains control of TSMC,
it could leap ahead in the global technology race, and Washington would
lose its most important source of semiconductors, constraining U.S.
economic growth and military innovation. [TSMC]{.underline}, however,
[cannot operate without Western components and intellectual property,
both of which could be immediately cut off after a Chinese
invasion]{.underline}. These steps, of course, would disrupt the United
States' own chip supply chains. Fortunately, [the United States is
already preparing for the possibility of losing access to Taiwanese
production by building semiconductor fabrication plants at
home]{.underline}. Boston Consulting Group has estimated that [the
United States is on track to produce 28 percent of the world's advanced
semiconductors by 2032]{.underline}.

The United States similarly has [little reason to fear that it would
lose access to East Asia's valuable economic markets if China controlled
Taiwan]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} likely [already has the
military capability to disrupt shipping through the narrow sea-lanes of
the East China and South China Seas, yet it has not done
so]{.underline}. [Fully blocking traffic would be expensive and
time-consuming for the PLA, even if China controlled Taiwan, and China's
own economy would suffer, too]{.underline}. [If necessary, commercial
ships]{.underline} headed for Japan or South Korea [could take new
routes, bypassing the South China Sea]{.underline} by traveling through
the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagoes or around Papua New Guinea
through the Solomon Sea.

Some argue that the United States must fight for Taiwan because a
failure to do so would undermine U.S. credibility, driving countries in
the region closer to China. This seems unlikely. India and Japan, two of
the United States' cornerstone partners in the Indo-Pacific, have a deep
history of animosity toward Beijing and tend to respond forcefully to
Chinese aggression. [To prevent Asian countries from aligning with
Beijing if it takes Taiwan, the United States should stop reinforcing
the idea that its reputation hinges on the defense of Taiwan. Instead,
it should focus on its larger objective---preventing Chinese regional
dominance]{.underline}---and stake its credibility on that.

### Tradeoff Turn---2AC

#### Winning in Taiwan requires winning in Ukraine first. Otherwise, resources get taken from Ukraine to defend Taiwan enabling Russia to win and then support China

US defense priorities appear to be at a crossroads. [[Can the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates materially [sustain Ukraine]{.mark} in
its fight with Russia [while preparing for a]{.mark}]{.underline}
possible fight with China in [[defense of Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}?
[[There appears to be a]{.underline} [competition for resources between
two seemingly distinct US fo]{.underline}]{.mark}[reign [po]{.mark}licy
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [if Russia defeats Ukraine and a
future war between the United States and China occurs over Taiwan, the
Russo-Ukrainian War will prove to be the first phase of this Sino-US
War]{.underline}. The [[defense of Taiwan tomorrow is intrinsically
linked to the defense of Ukraine today]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the
United States hopes to secure Taiwan---either through deterrence or
through victory in a future fight---[the United States must first ensure
that Ukraine maintains its sovereignty despite the Russian
invasion.]{.underline}

Two threats, one dilemma

Ukraine is in an existential fight with Russia, resisting a murderous
invasion through the resolve, courage, and endurance of the Ukrainian
people. Ukrainian resistance is all the more impressive considering
Russia's significant advantages in resources and manpower, and the
brutal disregard for human life that it transforms into tactical gains
on the battlefield. Given this disparity in military advantage,
sustaining Ukrainian resistance requires external support from a
coalition of partners providing security assistance in the form of
weapons, munitions, and materiel. [The United States is, and remains,
one of the key members of the coalition that supplies
Ukraine]{.underline}.

[At the same time, China continues its pressure campaign against Taiwan
while increasing military preparedness for a cross-strait
invasion]{.underline}. Whether China's pressure campaign or a future
military attack succeeds, the aim is the same: to destroy the
sovereignty of a free and democratic Taiwan and subordinate it to
communist China.

[[China is]{.mark} recognized as [the premier threat to US national
security]{.mark} interests, and the United States is committed to
Taiwan's defense. As such, [US]{.mark}, allied, and partnered [readiness
for this]{.mark} contingency [must be adequately resourced]{.mark}. This
is [essential to deterrence]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, should deterrence
fail, [to fighting and winning]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Therein lies an apparent dilemma. Doesn't [the [constant push of US
military support to Ukraine drain the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[of]{.mark} critical [resources]{.mark} [needed to defend
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}? This supposed conflict led some
commentators to speculate that supporting Ukraine undermines
preparedness for a Taiwan fight.

Their case is simple, arguing that supporting Ukraine drains the finite
US resources that should be husbanded and prioritized for deterring and
fighting China. Every missile, tank, and artillery shell sent to Ukraine
is one less round that could be fired in a China contingency. If
preparing for a future war with China is the priority, they argue, the
United States should deprioritize what they argue is a proxy war it is
fighting against Russia.

The fates of Ukraine and Taiwan are entwined

But if this is so, why is [[Taiwan's official position]{.mark} that the
[Russian invasion should be stopped]{.mark}]{.underline}? Why [do its
[officials say the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should]{.mark}
maintain unwavering [support]{.mark} to [Ukraine]{.mark}, [even at
Taiwan's expense]{.mark}]{.underline}? Joseph Wu, formerly the foreign
minister of Taiwan under the Tsai Ing-Wen administration and now the
secretary general of Taiwan's National Security Council, argued
compellingly that US aid to Ukraine is critical for deterring China, and
that [a [Russian victory would embolden China to move against
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While it is true that resources are finite, framing support to Ukraine
or Taiwan as mutually exclusive is a false dilemma that is strategically
unsound and unproductive to policymaking. More than that, it belies a
lack of appreciation for strategic timing and sequencing, and for the
connection between Russian aggression in Europe and Chinese aggression
in the Pacific.

[Ukraine]{.underline} isn't preparing for a potential future war against
Russia; it [is fighting for its very survival against Russia right
now]{.underline}. While [Russia]{.underline} isn't the premier threat to
the United States, it [remains an acute threat to US interests, one of
which is a free Ukraine]{.underline}. [With US support, Ukraine is
bleeding Russia dry]{.underline}---in a financial bargain for the United
States, with no cost of US lives, and without the political risk
associated with the commitment of forces on the ground. Russian threats
to interpret Western support as acts of war have proved to be mere saber
rattling, as the United States has crossed each Russian red line with no
significant consequence.

[[Russia]{.mark}'s inability to fight the war to a close has drained its
military resources to such a degree that]{.underline}, despite its
aspirations for great-power status, [it [must accept]{.mark} external
[support]{.mark}]{.underline} to continue its campaign[. Much of
this]{.underline} material and financial aid [comes [from
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [indebting]{.underline}]{.mark} Vladimir
[[Putin to Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping. A more shocking
demonstration of Russia's need for military support was its acceptance
of North Korean troops into the theater of war.

Moreover, the protracted nature of the war continues to have deleterious
effects on Russian national power. [If this trend continues]{.underline}
and Ukraine maintains its sovereignty at the war's end, [what was
formerly an acute threat to US interests will be a mere shell of its
former self]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, as a broken husk, will
not reap the economic rewards of conquering Ukraine in its entirety and
[will be greatly hampered in terms of affecting US operations in a
potential fight with China]{.underline}. In addition, US forces that
might have needed to be husbanded to defend against Russian aggression
and deployed to Europe to honor US treaty alliance commitments to NATO
could instead reinforce military requirements for the Pacific in the
defense of Taiwan. Finally, China will be further deterred from
aggression in the face of sustained US resolve to support Ukraine.
Despite the duration of the conflict, maintaining US support to Ukraine
will be seen as a parallel for how stalwart US support would be to
Taiwan if China threatened it.

The opposite is also true. [[Should US support to Ukraine fade]{.mark}
and Russia emerge victorious, [Russia will siphon economic power]{.mark}
from the resources it takes from a conquered Ukraine, [reconstitute its
military power]{.mark}, [and become emboldened toward greater aggression
throughout Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [China, too, will become
emboldened]{.underline}]{.mark} [by the faltering US resolve that led to
Ukraine's defeat]{.underline}, assured that the United States lacks the
stomach to hold out against aims for which China is willing to fight.
And [[in]{.mark} a future [Taiwan]{.mark} contingency, [Russia would be
postured to support China in its time of need and reciprocate via
material support]{.mark}, [while]{.mark} also [posing a]{.mark}
significant [threat to]{.mark} the rest of [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This would [[pin vital US forces]{.mark} and munitions [to]{.mark} the
[Europe]{.mark}an continent, [where they will be of no assistance
in]{.mark} a fight for [the defense of Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Because of its strategic effects, the lost war against Russia will have
proven to be the first phase in the eventual war against China. To
defend Taiwan tomorrow, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must
continue defending Ukraine]{.mark} today]{.underline}.

### Drones Bad---2AC

Aina **Turillazzi &** James **Char** 6-23-**'25** --- Aina Turillazzi is
a Ph.D. student at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at The
Australian National University, where her research focuses on emerging
technologies and crisis escalation.. James Char is assistant professor

Paradox in the Taiwan Strait"; The Diplomat; June 23, 2025;
<https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/the-drone-swarm-paradox-in-the-taiwan-strait/>

The technological gap vis-à-vis China's military power highlights
Taiwan's strategic quandary. Despite its recent NASAMS acquisition and
accelerated production of its indigenous Hsiung Feng-III supersonic
anti-ship missiles -- with 131 units ordered in 2022 and the Hsiung Chih
cruise missile now undergoing flight testing -- its conventional
precision-strike capabilities remain insufficient against Beijing's
overwhelming missile arsenal.

At the same time, the kinds of advanced systems required to counter a
formidable adversary such as the PLA Navy would demand greater
sophistication and resilience than the relatively less high-end drones
employed in the war in Ukraine. Those systems would include high
data-rate satellite communications with anti-jamming capabilities and
autonomous guidance systems -- requirements that drive costs far above
the "cheap and plentiful" threshold that makes mass reconstitution
viable.

The Capability Window Paradox

Taiwan's current defense strategy creates what might be termed a
"capability window paradox." As Taipei's drone capabilities mature
toward expected peak effectiveness by around 2025 or 2026, China faces a
narrowing window of opportunity where its traditional military
advantages can still decisively overwhelm swarm defenses. It also
follows that this temporal compression may create incentives for Beijing
to act sooner rather than later before Taiwan's drone capabilities reach
their full potential.

Moreover, other analysts also suggest that the United States'
"Replicator" program may inadvertently destabilize deterrence by
creating a technological arms race that compresses decision-making
timelines. Recent counter-drone advances have limited autonomy and
weapon efficacy, paradoxically increasing the urgency for fully
autonomous systems as militaries race to stay ahead. Such a dynamic
mirrors the pre-World War I naval arms race between Britain and Germany,
where technological innovation shortened the strategic decision-making
timelines and reduced the opportunities for diplomatic resolution. In
the present context of the Taiwan Strait, as each side develops more
sophisticated autonomous capabilities, the space for human judgment and
diplomatic intervention during crises may correspondingly also diminish.

Analysis of PLA flight activities in Taiwan's Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) similarly reveals escalating patterns of Chinese military
pressure designed to normalize crisis-level operations. The "Strait
Thunder-2025A" exercise represented a qualitative shift -- not merely
larger in scale than previous "Joint Sword" exercises, but operationally
bolder in terms of deploying greater numbers of the PLA's major assets
past the median line of the strait, and closer to Taiwan's contiguous
zone.

Institutional momentum further compounds this temporal pressure. Once
military bureaucracies have committed to specific unmanned technologies,
institutional inertia and sunk costs create pressure for early
deployment regardless of strategic discretion. As Jacquelyn Schneider
and Julia Macdonald outlined, military organizations often adopt
specific unmanned technologies based on institutional preferences,
bureaucratic processes, and doctrinal assumptions -- rather than purely
strategic logic. Taiwan's apparent focus on drone swarms might just
create such bureaucratic momentum, even when operational conditions
suggest alternative approaches may be more suitable.

Implications for Crisis Management

The proliferation of drone swarms on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
introduces novel pathways to inadvertent escalation that existing crisis
management frameworks are ill-equipped to address. Taipei's
predisposition toward drone swarms creates a first-mover disadvantage
whereby defensive preparations become indistinguishable from offensive
posturing. Indeed, the requirement to disperse and activate drone assets
early in a crisis to ensure survivability could paradoxically signal
hostile intent from Beijing's perspective, compressing the period of
warning available for diplomatic intervention.

This ambiguity of intent is compounded by fundamental attribution errors
inherent in the use of swarm technologies. Put another way, the dual-use
nature of drone concentrations -- equally capable of defensive area
denial or coordinated offensive strikes -- creates intelligence
assessment challenges that favor preemptive action over strategic
patience. At the same time, China's investments in drone swarm
capabilities heightens this security dilemma, as its defense planners
must assume worst-case scenarios when conceptualizing their own use of
concentrated drone deployments.

The automation of response systems further erodes traditional escalation
control mechanisms. As drone warfare operates at machine learning speed
rather than along human decision-making timelines, the compressed
reaction cycles leave insufficient space for the political oversight and
strategic restraint that have historically prevented conflicts from
spiraling beyond their original scope.

Taipei's asymmetric defense strategy, while tactically sound given its
resource constraints vis-à-vis its giant neighbor, may be complicated by
the maritime domain of operations. Cheap, plentiful systems are more
suitable for land warfare, while naval combat rewards platform
survivability and sophisticated munitions -- not just the mass
production of attritable assets. China's approach incorporating uncrewed
platforms, which combines both drone capabilities such as the Jiu Tian
as well as advanced missiles, integrates multiple systems rather than
relying on single-technology solutions.

The convergence of autonomous technologies with traditional missile
warfare creates new categories of escalation risk. When algorithms can
trigger responses faster than human judgment can intervene, the
traditional mechanisms of crisis management become inadequate. Rather
than enhancing deterrence, the current trajectory toward increasingly
autonomous systems may in fact be recreating the conditions for arms
racing that have historically preceded major conflicts. Recognizing this
paradox is a crucial first step in developing crisis management
approaches that account for how rapidly evolving military technologies
can outpace human oversight.

### Regime Change Bad

#### Regime change causes [more problems]{.underline} than it solves\-\--empirics.

**Chivvis 25** \[Christopher S. Chivvis; Senior fellow and Director of
the Carnegie Endowment's American Statecraft Program; 6/26/2025; The
Guardian; "It's time for America to remember how dangerous regime change
is"

accessed 7/14/2025; Lowell-DB\]

The ceasefire
between [Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran) and [Israel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel) might
still hold, but if not, the United States might double down on its
weekend strikes and seek the overthrow of the Iranian regime. [Donald
Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) threatened this
in comments and tweets earlier, and top officials such as [Marco
Rubio](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio) have said they
wouldn't mind it if it happened. Israeli leaders are openly in favor. If
the US goes down this road, it will not be for the first time.

[In the last 80 years, Washington has overthrown many
regimes]{.underline}. For a superpower, toppling foreign governments is
not so hard to do. Getting the outcome you want is. This makes regime
change as dangerous as it is seductive, as past US attempts clearly
show.

The US overthrow of the Japanese and German governments in the second
world war made [a whole generation of American leaders **too
optimistic** about regime change]{.underline}. [Germany's and Japan's
transformation into strong democratic allies was]{.underline} a source
of inspiration for the regime changes that dotted the cold war -- but a
**[misleading]{.underline}** one. The only successful changer of regimes
in the two centuries before had been Napoleon Bonaparte -- and his
regimes were fleeting.

The [United States helped overthrow Iranian leader Mohammad
Mosaddegh]{.underline} in 1953, but this [sowed seeds of resentment that
**helped** birth today's extremist government]{.underline}. In 1954, the
CIA recruited a group of Guatemalan exiles to overthrow the
Soviet-leaning leader Jacobo Árbenz. In 1961, US-backed rebels landed at
the Bay of Pigs, in a failed attempt to overthrow Cuba's Fidel Castro.
The US and the Soviet Union fought covert and overt wars to topple
regimes from the 1960s until the 1980s, especially in Latin America, but
also in Africa and After the cold war, regime change took on a new
purpose as American leaders imagined a better world, free of violent
ethnic hatred and a post-Soviet space full of flourishing democracies
aligned with the United States. The popularity of the theory of
democratic peace, according to which democracies are unlikely to go to
war with each other, made the practice of turning non-democratic regimes
around seem like the bedfellow of world peace and helped justify regime
change on moral as well as national security grounds. And so, the US and
its allies overthrew more regimes.

The first target was Serbian autocrat Slobodan Milošević. His overthrow
proceeded in stages, beginning with coercive airstrikes on his allies in
1995, spreading to Serbia itself in 1999, and ending with the toppling
of his regime in elections in 2000. The US role in changing the regimes
in Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan over the next few years -- the
so-called color revolutions -- was indirect and more limited than
adversaries like Russia have made it out to be, but two decades later
none of these countries is very stable or democratic. Serbia is ruled by
a Kremlin-leaning nationalist. Kyrgyzstan is unstable, Georgia has
become a client state of Russia and, sadly, Ukraine is under siege from
a vengeful Russian president.

[The long-term outcomes of fostering uprisings against unwanted regimes
have thus not been promising.]{.underline}

The 9/11 attacks unleashed a fury of American vengeance that made
possible military action on a much larger scale. If the US role in
changing the regimes of these post-socialist states was visible mostly
in the "grey zone", nothing was opaque about the overthrow of the
Taliban and Saddam Hussein.

In Afghanistan, America's lightning-fast campaign made quick work of the
Taliban. But US technological advantages melted in the face of an
insurgency in a country that was foreign to most Americans who went to
fight there, and in which the US national interest was limited to
finding Osama bin Laden. [After two decades of trying to construct an
Afghan democracy]{.underline}, [Joe Biden]{.underline} wisely [withdrew,
acknowledging defeat]{.underline}, and with it the limits of America's
regime-changing power.

[In 2003, the US military also crushed the Iraqi regime]{.underline}
with "shock and awe" that impressed the world -- just as the Trump
administration's recent bombing of Iran initially did. The regime that
replaced Saddam in Iraq was more democratic, but it [was also a
strategic gift to Iran, who]{.underline} now [expanded its power into
the vacuum that regime change had created.]{.underline}

[Military intervention in Libya]{.underline} in 2011 removed Muammar
Gaddafi, nobly enforcing the UN doctrine of "Responsibility to Protect".
But it left behind a sore in the side of all of north Africa and the
Mediterranean basin, one that [added to the chaos in Syria, encouraged
the collapse of Mali and facilitated Europe's immigration
crisis.]{.underline}

Russia is now attempting regime change in Ukraine but has encountered
similar challenges. Its experience there is an abject reminder of the
fact that [to everyone except the would-be regime-changer, these
operations]{.underline} mostly [look like brutal
imperialism.]{.underline}

On October 26, [2001]{.underline}, Jim [Roche]{.underline}, the [then
Secretary of the Air Force]{.underline}, stood behind the podium in the
Pentagon briefing room to [announce that Lockheed Martin had won the
competition to build the F-35 J]{.underline}oint [S]{.underline}trike
[F]{.underline}ighter. [Joining him]{.underline} on the stage, were
Edward [Aldridge, the Undersecretary]{.underline} of Defense [for
Acquisition]{.underline} and Technology, and Gordon [England, the
Secretary of the Navy. **All three took turns at the microphone to tout
the Joint Strike Fighter's anticipated virtues.**]{.underline} "The
Joint Strike Fighter is a family of highly common, lethal, survivable,
supportable, and affordable next generation multirole strike fighter
aircraft," said Aldridge. All these **[claims have proven to be
spurious]{.underline}** to a greater or lesser extent in subsequent
years as the F**[-35 program limped through a seemingly endless
development process,]{.underline}** but none so much as the "affordable"
claim. [At the time of the announcement]{.underline}, the F-[35 was
supposed to enter active service in 2008 and the program was expected to
cost \$200 billion.]{.underline} Nearly [23 years later]{.underline},
the **[F-35 is officially the most expensive weapon program in history
clocking with an anticipated total program cost of \$2 trillion and
engineers continue to struggle to make the jet work properly with
development and procurement costs having more than
doubled.]{.underline}** The [three men who made that announcement were
nearing the end]{.underline} of their long careers. Aldridge retired
from the government in 2003 and went on to serve on the board of
Lockheed Martin. Jim Roche left the Pentagon in 2005 and became the
director of Orbital ATK. Gordon England eventually became deputy
secretary of defense before retiring in 2009. Through their
[J]{.underline}oint [S]{.underline}trike [F]{.underline}ighter decision,
these three men committed the United States to spend **[hundreds of
billions of dollars for a program that has proven to be an unmitigated
disaster]{.underline}**. They created a [massive financial
obligation]{.underline} that future generations of taxpayers must bear,
without the much-touted program having produced any of the actual
security benefits it was supposed to bring to the U.S. armed forces. By
the time the program's conceptual flaws became obvious, all three
individuals had long since left government service and it was left to an
entire generation of their successors to salvage something from the mess
they left behind. It is that last point the individuals who temporarily
occupy offices vested with such authorities need to keep front of mind.
They have the power to commit future generations to truly massive
amounts of spending. All three of the prime F-35 decision-makers were
born in the 1930s making them part of the Silent Generation. Generation
X, the Millennials, and Gens Z and Alpha must bear the burden of their
decisions. The power to spend such generational wealth should not be
wielded in a perfunctory manner. Those with the power of the pen should
be far less credulous when people pitch them on pie-in-the-sky programs
based on unproven technological promises and assumptions. [Amid growing
concerns over the perceived threat of great power conflict and nuclear
confrontation, the national security establishment and policymakers have
relied upon misguided lessons about how the U.S. maintained the peace
and won the Cold Wa]{.underline}r to [resurrect the hubristic reliance
on expensive tech]{.underline}nology to provide, at least on paper, a
military superiority that we hope will preserve the preeminence of our
military. Prominent figures in Congress have called for a
"[generational" investment]{.underline} in U.S. defense spending that
would see [defense spending rise to 5% of GDP by 2030]{.underline} with
**[little regard for those who will ultimately have to foot the
bill.]{.underline}** While it is hypothetically possible to reach this
goal it does not mean we should. Take for example the decision to
modernize all three legs of the nuclear triad simultaneously, a
monumental (and likely self-defeating) undertaking estimated to cost a
staggering \$1.7 trillion over the coming decades, a figure that mirrors
the totality of student debt! The issue is that the **[individual
components of this effort have proven to be unanticipatedly more
complicated and expensive than originally projected]{.underline}**. For
instance, the Air Force's [Sentinel
i]{.underline}nter[c]{.underline}ontinental [b]{.underline}allistic
[m]{.underline}issile **[program has overrun its budget projection by
more than 81%.]{.underline}** Regardless of policymakers' justification
for this irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars, there has been a
complete **[lack of accountability within the defense procurement
apparatus]{.underline}**. [The forebears of tomorrow are failing to use
this moment as an opportunity to avoid repeating the mistakes of the
F-35, Littoral Combat Ship, Ford-class Aircraft Carrier, and
Zumwalt-class Destroyer programs all while undermining the ability of
the average American to achieve the quintessential goals of the American
Dream. **Pouring funds into the abyss, or simply the pockets of defense
executives who then initiate stock buy-backs while enjoying record
profits for the defense industry quarter after quarter, ensure that
future generations will be forced to make sacrifices on other national
security priorities like infrastructure, the power grid, national debt,
student debt, the economy, education, supply chain resiliency,
healthcare and more to comply with the commitments made by our political
leaders who are consigning future generations to insurmountable debt in
the name of an illusory concept of "national security."**]{.underline}
Since the year 2000, the U.S. increased its defense spending by at least
48% when adjusting for inflation. So, how can it be that after ending
the longest wars in our nation's history, and already spending more on
our national security than at peak times during the Vietnam and Korean
Wars, we still need to spend more money on defense? The [security and
economic well-being of future generations will not be manifested through
the myopic decisions to increase defense spending in the name of more
security. Continuing to print money for the development of new weapons
programs that will likely be outmoded by the time they are ready for a
hypothetical war will keep weapons contractors and shareholders happy,
but it will do little to actually make Americans or our allies safer
amidst a rapidly changing world.]{.underline} It is time for
policymakers in Washington to realize that there is **[more that goes
into our national security than just spending more money on the
military, and devote real time and energy to a realistic and sustainable
strategy that builds confidence, readiness and stability into our
national security.]{.underline}**

We cannot know Xi's priorities with certainty. Nevertheless, from what
we can observe, an elective [[war against Taiwan is
**hardly**]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[compelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
proposition [for Xi]{.underline}'s government.

[Even with China's massive arsenal]{.underline} of modern warships,
combat aircraft and missiles, [[Beijing is **nowhere near** the]{.mark}
level of [superiority that would **guarantee**]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}**ful invasion [given the probability of
US and Japanese]{.underline} military [resistance]{.underline}. [[Xi
would need to]{.mark} worry about]{.underline} more than
[**[ferry]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} enough [[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}
and their supplies across the Strait [[through the **gauntlet**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Taiwanese, **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Japanese]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[ships]{.underline}, [missiles]{.underline},
[sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline}, [[mines and drones]{.mark}. A
cross-Strait [war would disrupt]{.mark} regional [economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}, threatening the livelihoods of millions
of Chinese. [The **[resulting]{.mark}**]{.underline} social
[[**turmoil** could **endanger Xi**]{.mark}'s rule]{.underline}.

[[A]{.mark} Chinese **[blockade]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Taiwan's ports
would be less risky, but [would have disadvantages. Taiwan's government
may]{.underline} choose to [resist. Beijing's action [would
stimulate]{.mark} increased **[anti-China
coop]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration around the world; [China could
expect]{.underline} to suffer **[sanctions]{.underline}** over a long
period. And [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would have **ample time** to **surge
forces**]{.underline}]{.mark} into the region to assist Taiwan.

Beijing's attempts to intimidate the US government into abandoning
support for Taiwan have failed. [Helping Taiwan to defend itself remains
bipartisan]{.underline} US policy, even supported by Republican Party
politicians who want to stop arming Ukraine. Despite the longstanding US
policy of "strategic ambiguity", President Joe Biden has publicly stated
four times that US forces would intervene in Taiwan's defence.

[Xi doesn't necessarily need to **solve** the **Taiwan** problem during
his tenure to **earn a legacy**]{.underline} in Chinese history. [Xi has
three **huge domestic projects**]{.underline}. The first is [restoring
the primacy]{.underline} and authority [of the]{.underline} Communist
**[Party]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} prior to Xi's tenure as
general secretary [had suffered a decline in prestige due
to]{.underline} rampant **[corruption]{.underline}**, decentralised
governance and the empowerment of civil society. The
[second]{.underline} is what Xi sees as **[ideological
purification]{.underline}**, including cleansing China of "Western"
ideas and values. [Third]{.underline}, Xi must oversee [the transition
of China's **econ**]{.underline}omy from reliance on exports and
investment in infrastructure to a new model that can maintain robust
growth and advance China from a middle-income [to]{.underline} a
**[high-income]{.underline}** country. Success in [these projects would
be **enough**]{.underline} to secure **[glory for Xi]{.underline}**, who
already enjoys a section in the Party's constitution honouring "Xi
Jinping Thought."

[A **struggling econ**]{.underline}omy [does not make Beijing more
likely to launch a war. China's **[economic
malaise]{.mark}**]{.underline} appears to have
**[[dampened]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Chinese public's
[**[enthusiasm]{.mark}** for a Taiwan campaign. [The **natural
reaction** to]{.mark} a [lack of strength]{.mark} at home [is to be
**more cautious**]{.mark}]{.underline} in foreign affairs, [not **more
aggressive**]{.underline}. Thus, [the appearance of serious issues in
China's economy in 2023 led to Xi trying to **lower
tensions**]{.underline} with the United States, and a direct appeal to
the business community to invest more in China during Xi's visit to
California last year.

Several US commentators and politicians raised alarm about Xi
purportedly "warning" Biden during the California summit that China
plans to forcibly seize Taiwan. A more accurate summary of Xi's remarks
would be that he restated the decades-old mantra that unification will
happen. He gave no timeline, he said he hoped it would occur by peaceful
means, and he denied that his government has a plan to attack Taiwan.

Like any People's Republic paramount leader, [Xi must **repeat the
promise** of eventual unification]{.underline}, build up a military
machine that deters independence, insist that the international
community adheres to the "one China" principle, and maintain pressure on
Taipei to enter negotiations with Beijing. [There is no indication that
Xi's position in China is in jeopardy due to a perception he is not
tough enough toward Taiwan]{.underline}.

[Xi needs merely to avoid Taiwan **declaring**]{.underline} formal
**[independence]{.underline}**. If Taiwan did do so, Xi would probably
opt for war. But [even Taiwanese governments controlled by
the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**emocratic
**[P]{.underline}**rogressive **[P]{.underline}**arty, which rejects the
idea of Taiwan being part of China, [have shown that they **will not
cross this** line.]{.underline}

[[Xi reached the pinnacle]{.mark} of the Party hierarchy
[through]{.mark} a career of **[careful
positioning]{.mark}**]{.underline} and quiet ruthlessness, [[not]{.mark}
by taking **[grand gambles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Since then, [he has
shown a preference for **grey-zone tactics**]{.mark}. There is
**no**]{.underline} convincing [**reason** to expect him to rush to a
military showdown over Taiwan]{.underline}.

### No Taiwan War---1AR

#### Interdependence, military risks, and the Silicon Shield check.

(Victoria, 3-27-2024, \"The US is Overestimating the Likelihood of War
in the Taiwanese Strait,\" Georgetown Public Policy Review,
https://gppreview.com/2024/03/27/the-us-is-overestimating-the-likelihood-of-war-in-the-taiwanese-strait/)

The recent Taiwanese elections have reignited international political
discourse on the possibility of war in the Taiwan Strait. Given the
historical complexities of Taiwan-China relations and the role they play
in U.S. foreign policy, [many U.S.]{.underline} foreign policy (USFP)
[experts are [predicting]{.mark} imminent [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the region. However, [this [is a]{.mark}]{.underline} significant
[[**miscalculation** of **Beijing's appetite for
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}. USFP officials commonly misinterpret Chinese
domestic politics and dynamics, especially concerning Taiwan.
Furthermore, almost two years after the outbreak of war in Ukraine, USFP
commentators still falsely draw parallels between Ukraine and Taiwan and
underestimate the power of Taiwan's "Silicon Shield."

[[Xi's rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark} on Taiwan [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategic **[[political posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Chinese President Xi Jinping's stated intention to reunite Taiwan with
China is closely tied to his desire to consolidate power over the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Early in his tenure, Xi has strategically
cultivated support within the CCP to dismantle presidential term limits,
diverging from Deng Xiaoping's tradition of orderly and
institutionalized power transitions. In his address during the CCP's
centenary ceremony, he affirmed his policy of pursuing peaceful national
reunification but did not reveal the timeline for doing so. This
omission implies that [Xi's discourse serves]{.underline} primarily [as
a mechanism [to solidify]{.mark} internal CCP
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than as a definitive roadmap for
action. Bang Xiao, a reporter and analyst on Chinese affairs, postulates
that showing ambition to take Taiwan will "cement Xi's place as a
remarkable person in China's history" -- indicating how his ambitious
messaging on Taiwanese reunification is a political power play. [The
possibility of reunifying Taiwan and China is an emotive
issue]{.underline} for Chinese citizens. [Xi's rhetoric is pandering to
these emotions to appeal to his citizens and engender support within the
CCP, **[without]{.mark}** clearly signaling [a commitment to
**actualize**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[reunification]{.underline}]{.mark}** of China and Taiwan.

Furthermore, Beijing recognises that [[invading]{.mark} Taiwan [would
result in]{.mark} international [**isolation** and]{.mark}
condemnation]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} but not limited to
**[[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and embargoes from Western nations.
[This could reverse Beijing's efforts to expand power]{.underline} and
influence, and dampen Xi's global ambitions. Economic
[[**interdependence** is China's **key
vulnerability**]{.underline},]{.mark} [[since]{.mark} the
**[CCP]{.mark}**'s [**legitimacy** rests on]{.mark} its]{.underline}
ability to [maintain]{.underline} social, political and **[[economic
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** within China and its trade and economic
stability rests on the global market.

China and Taiwan do not mirror Russia and Ukraine

Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine a year ago has
led many USFP commentators to draw a comparison to China's approach
toward Taiwan; however, Russia's direct military aggression contrasts
with China's blend of diplomatic pressure and military preparedness.
Although the war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that the threat of
cross-border conflicts is omnipresent, Taiwan and Ukraine differ
geopolitically, historically and strategically. The only real parallel
is that both countries are exposed to a large, aggressive authoritarian
neighbor. Taiwan is separated from China by the 180 km long Taiwan
Strait, compared to the long land border between Russia and Ukraine.
[[An invasion]{.mark} by China [would be **logistically**]{.mark} **more
[arduous]{.mark}** than Russia's invasion into Ukraine and would require
a large number of ships]{.underline} heavily [laden with equipment,
which would be vulnerable to attacks]{.underline}. [[The **slow
pace**]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[vessels would expose
them to]{.underline}]{.mark} long-range **[[missile
strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, submarine assaults, and other forms of
advanced weaponry. Harlan Ullman, a senior advisor at the Atlantic
Council, emphasizes that to counter Taiwan's potential 45,000 defense
force, [China would need to mobilize over 1.2 million
soldiers]{.underline} from its active military personnel, which exceeds
2 million. However, [[the Chinese Navy possesses]{.mark} only [a
**fraction** of the **necessary artillery**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
facilitate an invasion of that magnitude.

In addition, due to the historical association between Taiwan and the
U.S., as enshrined in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the [U.S. is the
island's primary security partner. This heightens the global
consequences]{.underline} of conflict between China and Taiwan, to a far
greater extent than the war in Ukraine. Regardless of China's increasing
military assertiveness, [the U.S.' **de facto alliance**]{.underline}
with Taiwan [acts as]{.underline} "diplomatic
**[deterrence]{.underline}**" against China. The Center for Strategic
International Studies' military experts even predict total destruction
of an invading Chinese militia by a U.S.-led coalition before any
occupation of Taiwan could occur.

Contrary to what might be inferred from Moscow and Beijing's
announcement of a no-limits partnership, the two states also follow
different strategies to advance their interests. [China's]{.underline}
strategic [priority of peaceful unification]{.underline} with Taiwan
[follows the dream of a one-China principle, and Chinese rhetoric
**stresses** the maintenance of a **peaceful environment**]{.underline}
while pursuing its historical mission of territorial expansion. In line
with this, China has emphasized soft economic inducements as much as
hard diplomatic and military pressure. By contrast, Russia's invasion of
Ukraine was an aggressive attempt to secure its "near abroad" and
counter NATO's expansion -- an aim driven by Moscow's perception of a
swiftly deteriorating strategic environment. This fostered a sense of
urgency and hardened Moscow's appetite for war.

Taiwan's "Silicon Shield"

Many USFP commentators predict that China will invade
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} to assume control of
it[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} cutting-edge microchip and **[[semiconductor
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, this industry, home to 92% of
the world's most advanced production of semiconductors, [[acts as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[Silicon Shield]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
against the possibility of an invasion as global economic dependence on
this technology magnifies the importance of peace and stability. [China
imports 40% of the global supply of semiconductors and,]{.underline}
even though it invests heavily in its domestic capability, [relies on
Taiwanese production to prop up its]{.underline} booming \$228.30
billion [electronics industry]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [China mines 72% of the world's silicon]{.underline}, an
integral component for semiconductors, which illustrates the
interdependence of China and Taiwan's [economies. [Beijing is]{.mark}
**highly [strategic]{.mark}** [and understands]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[even a]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese naval [[**blockade** would]{.mark}
severely restrict trade]{.underline}, exacerbating global economic
tensions, causing dramatic supply-chain disruptions and
[**[lead]{.mark}**ing [to **trillion dollar losses**]{.mark} in economic
output]{.underline}. [[At worst,]{.mark} military [conflict
would]{.mark}]{.underline} risk **[[destroy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
[[Taiwan's]{.mark} semiconductor [industry]{.mark} and]{.underline}
seriously [harm China's **own econ**]{.underline}omy.

While USFP commentators should not underestimate the potential for
Chinese military expansion, they should also understand the nuances in
Beijing's posture towards Taiwan. A false interpretation of Chinese
domestic politics could result in inaccurate comparisons between
Russia-Ukraine and China-Taiwan that could, in turn, provoke USFP
actions that overstep China's red line.
