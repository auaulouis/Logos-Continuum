### Cables\-\--Thumped\-\--1NC

#### Past cable damage [thumps]{.underline} the impact

Dan **Milmo 7/17**, Milmo; July 2024; Global technology editor at The
Guardian, covering cybersecurity, AI, and digital infrastructure; The
Guardian, "Fears grow over sabotage of undersea internet cables,"
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/17/risk-undersea-cable-attacks-backed-russia-china-likely-rise-report-warns
// [shaka]{.underline}

[Recorded Future identified [44 cable damages over the **past 18
months**]{.mark}, a quarter caused by "**anchor dragging**" and nearly a
third by "**unknown causes**", with seismic activity or natural
phenomena causing 16% of the incidents.]{.underline}

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

Analysts added that **[damaging subsea cables could be an attractive
tactic]{.underline}** because it allowed states to target adversaries'
infrastructure via an unsophisticated method that could be passed off as
an accident or be carried out by vessels without direct links to the
attacks' suspected sponsor.

Recorded Future said improved monitoring of cables and security measures
around subsea infrastructure, as well as comprehensive stress tests,
would help prevent an incident damaging multiple cables and causing
"prolonged connectivity issues".

[Despite the high-profile Baltic and Taiwan incidents, the three most
disruptive incidents were elsewhere: in the Red Sea in February [last
year]{.mark} when a [Houthi missile caused a ship's anchor to **hit
cables**]{.mark} -- leading to "significant impact on communication
networks in the Middle East"]{.underline}; in west Africa a month later
due to an underwater rock slide; and off the coast of South Africa in
May 2024 due to a cable-dragging incident.

Recorded Future said the impact of the Red Sea and Africa incidents
showed that the most prolonged disruption happened in areas with limited
availability of alternative cables and a shortage of repair expertise
regardless of the cause of the disruption.

[Conversely, [**two attacks** in the Baltic Sea]{.mark} in November last
year [had **minimal impact** due to spare **capacity** and]{.mark}
Europe's **[resilient]{.mark}** internet
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However, the report said three
EU island member states -- Malta, Cyprus and Ireland -- were more
vulnerable due to their reliance on submarine cables for international
communications.

[[Outages]{.mark} and slowdowns [around the world]{.mark}]{.underline} -
but who is behind the attacks?

[[**Multiple fiber cables were cut** in]{.mark} Southern [France,
in]{.mark} what appears to be [a targeted attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The incident is]{.mark} the [second]{.mark} in the country [this
year]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back in April, multiple cables were cut in
the country overnight in a coordinated incident.

[\"We are aware of a major cable cut in the South of France that has
impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US, and
potentially other parts of the world,\" cloud security company Zscaler
said in a blog post.]{.underline}

\"As a result of the cable cut, customers may see packet loss and or
latency for websites and applications which traverse these impacted
paths.\"

The company said that there were at least three cable cuts -
Marseille-Lyon, Marseille-Milano, and Marseille-Barcelona. Police were
on-site at the first cut, investigating the cuts, which caused delays to
the repairs.

The cuts echo those in April, although it is not known for certain that
they are connected. The Spring cuts caused outages across France,
impacting 10 Internet and infrastructure companies and several cities.

"The people knew what they were doing," Michel Combot, the managing
director of the French Telecoms Federation, told Wired. "Those were what
we call backbone cables that were mostly connecting network service from
Paris to other locations in France, in three directions."

Arthur PB Laudrain, a researcher at the University of Oxford's
department of politics and international relations who has been studying
the attacks, added: "It implies a lot of coordination and a few teams.\"

No groups or individuals claimed responsibility for the damage, and
French police have not announced any arrests related to the damage. It
is not known if the cuts are related to Covid conspiracy theories,
anti-tech activity, or for another reason.

[Last week, [submarine cables to the Shetland Islands were
**cut**]{.mark}, causing Internet outages in the remote Scottish
archipelago. While such outages are usually accidental,
British [tabloids]{.mark} have [focused on]{.mark} the presence of [a
Russian]{.mark} \"research [ship]{.mark}\" near the
cut, [suggesting]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} could have [**intentionally
damaged** the cable.]{.mark} Russia is also accused of sabotaging the
Nordstream gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea, but there is no proof it was
involved in the Shetland cut.]{.underline}

Even accidental damage far from home can have significant consequences

[As with so many things, the [most straightforward threat to undersea
cables is]{.mark} posed by **[unintended error]{.mark}** rather than
conspiracy. The United Nations estimates that between **[100-150
cables]{.mark}** are [damaged **annually**]{.mark} with the
most [frequent
culprit]{.mark} being [fishing]{.mark} activity.28]{.underline}

[While potentially costly to their owners, accidental faults of this
kind pose a [relatively limited]{.mark} direct [threat to advanced
economies thanks to]{.mark} the [highly diversified nature]{.mark} of
their cable networks. [Britain]{.mark}, for example, is [connected
to]{.mark} mainland [Europe
and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nites [S]{.mark}tates [by more than
30 fibre]{.mark}-optic cables30, meaning that if one or two are
damaged by fishing activity, [there is plenty of spare
capacity]{.mark} for data to be rerouted without causing
disruption.]{.underline}

[It's conceivable, too, that as the game of hide-and-seek becomes more
difficult for everyone, [navies may take **offensive measures**]{.mark}
to protect the stealth of their submarines. This could entail less overt
tactics for peacetime and more aggressive operations in a crisis. Clark
gives an example: "[A boat could drag its anchor along the seabed to
**destroy**]{.mark} **transmission [cables]{.mark}** and still maintain
plausible deniability" by [making it look like an
accident.]{.mark}]{.underline} The boat could then "monitor the ships
and UUVs that arrive to perform infrastructure repairs, gathering vital
intelligence about the adversary."

Digital domain

The [cable infrastructure is susceptible]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
numerous **[threats in cyberspace]{.underline}**, [such as]{.underline}
the one posed by the use of [remote network management systems
(**RNMS**)]{.underline}. [RNMS are]{.underline} tools [used to remotely
**control** and **monitor** cable activities]{.underline}, such as data
transmission flows and the power of the overall infrastructure.
[Their]{.underline} relative **[cost-efficiency]{.underline}** [makes
them]{.underline} highly [**attractive** for cable
operators]{.underline} [but]{.underline} some [lacks]{.underline}
[critical]{.underline} layers of **[security]{.underline}**. Indeed, for
ease of use, RNMS are often operating on non-air gapped systems using
common operating systems such as Windows or Linux and running on common
protocols like TCP/IP. Additionally, RNMS interface with the system that
can selectively switch or route individual wavelength within an optical
fiber network. These systems also enable the insertion and extraction of
specific wavelengths at different points in the network, which is
crucial for directing traffic efficiently. Most importantly, the
wavelength selective switch (WSS ROADMs) is reconfigurable, which means
that operators can remotely adjust the paths of wavelength and the
configuration of optical channels without physical intervention on the
hardware.

Hence, although RNMS provide highly cost-effective services in the
operation of one or multiple cables, it must also contend with
operational security risks at the logical and information layers. The
[connection to the Internet]{.underline} [provides **ease of
hacking**]{.underline}; the hacking of RNMS provides access to WSS
ROADMs; control over WSS ROADMs allows the activation or blocking of
specific wavelength [which could be used to collect or **disrupt** the
flow of data]{.underline}. Finally, [there are no common
standards]{.underline} nor guidelines as [for how RNMS]{.underline}
[should be]{.underline} operated and [secured]{.underline}. One way to
mitigate this threat would be through NATO implementing collective
standards to build more secure and resilient systems and networks. A
first step could be the implementation of passive cybersecurity
measures, such as automated traffic monitoring and stronger access
controls, to then transition towards zero-trust architectures, mandatory
air-gapping, and active network monitoring.

### Cables\-\--No Threat\-\--1NC

#### Cable threats are [inflated]{.underline}

John **Aitken 25**, \[John Aitken is an associate researcher at RAND
Europe and previously was a former submarine commander who researches
maritime security\], 7-8-2025, \"Undersea Cables Are Vulnerable to
Sabotage---but This Takes Skill and Specialist Equipment\",
https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/07/undersea-cables-are-vulnerable-to-sabotage-but.html
// shaka

[But, as a former submarine commander who researches maritime security,
I believe that [attacking and disrupting the network is **not as easy as
some reports might make it appear.**]{.mark} Deliberately snagging a
pipeline with a dragging anchor in relatively shallow waters can cause a
lot of damage, but it is fairly **indiscriminate** trick with a shelf
life, since the [damage can be **repaired**, and deniability becomes
**increasingly difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Targeting the cable networks in deeper waters require **more
sophisticated methods**]{.mark}, which are much more challenging to
carry out.]{.underline}

[A hostile [state]{.mark} wishing to attack this network first [needs to
**locate**]{.mark} the [cables]{.mark} they wish to target. The majority
of the newer commercial cables are very **clearly charted**, but their
positions are **not exact**.]{.underline}

Cables and pipelines, even the heaviest ones, will drift somewhat as
they are laid, and the deeper the water they sit in, the greater the
distance they may drift.

Those newer cables are often buried in a shallow trench to protect them,
which makes locating and accessing them more challenging. Older cables
were laid in slightly less exact navigational times, some before the GPS
network was available for civilian use. They are not in pristine or
predictable patterns.

[The positions of cables used by the military are generally not
advertised at all, for reasons of security. Locating the target cable
[requires a **detailed understanding** of the **topography** and
**features of the seabed**]{.mark}. That sort of picture can only be
built up by **survey and reconnaissance**.]{.underline}

### Cables\-\--No Threat\-\--2NC

#### Cables [don't]{.underline} impact financial transactions---t[here are backups now]{.underline} 

**Chan 25 --** \[Bianca Chan covers finance and technology for Business

https://www.businessinsider.com/severed-undersea-cables-big-problem-wall-street-2025-2

Abend said the critical public and private industries --- such as
banking, telecommunications, and the government --- that leverage these
cables should work together to agree on a sort of prioritization
schedule to make sure the most critical traffic and transactions are
rerouted first to alternative cables.

[[While]{.mark} the [incidents in the past]{.mark} 18 months [have
brought]{.mark} the [risk of disrupted subsea cables]{.mark} to the
forefront, [it **doesn\'t**]{.mark} necessarily [reflect]{.mark} the
[increased risk to]{.mark} the [financial sector]{.mark}]{.underline},
the FS-ISAC\'s Dicker said. He said [[the world hosts **sufficient
subsea cables** to allow data and money **to flow through
alternative**]{.mark} **[paths]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

There\'s no doubt that systemically [important financial institutions
with \$10 billion-plus tech budgets, which are subject to massive
amounts of regulatory scrutiny, are spending a lot of time on this
issue,]{.underline} James Kaplan, a McKinsey partner and technology
practice leader, told BI. But niche institutions with less regulatory
oversight and limited ability to disrupt the US financial system have
fewer resources to focus on this, he said.

If Kaplan were to ask chief information security officers or chief
technology officers about this, \"I think they would say, \'This is life
in the big city. Yes, this is something I have to worry about. Is this
at the top of my list? No,\'\" he said.

argued Rawle.]{.underline}

[Madory supported this view, citing [recent incidents]{.mark} where
[Chinese patents]{.mark} for cable-cutting equipment [were
**mischaracterized**]{.mark}: \"Someone came across a [patent for a cut
and hold grapnel]{.mark}, like a standard thing [that would be on any

As deterring Russia's behavior directly remains difficult, there is no
reason to assume that hybrid CUI attacks will not continue. Some
evidence exists, however, that [states in the Baltic and]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline} areas [are]{.underline} [experimenting]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} new [methods to **disincentivize**]{.underline} such
[hybrid attacks]{.underline}. For example, [the
**E**uropean]{.underline} [**U**nion]{.underline} released a statement
on December 26, 2024, [claiming it would **strengthen** its efforts to
protect undersea cables using]{.underline} better **[detection
technology]{.underline}** (European Union External Action, December 26,
2024). Additionally, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**) [announced]{.underline} on January 14 [the
deployment of a]{.underline} [new **Baltic Sentry**]{.underline} "[to
deter]{.underline} any [future attempts]{.underline} by a state or
non-state actor [to damage critical undersea
infrastructure]{.underline}" in the Baltic Sea (Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe, NATO, January 14). [**Individual states** can also
**deter Russian behavior**]{.underline} (European Union External Action
Service, December 26, 2024). For example, [when the
Finland-Estonia]{.underline} electric [link was disrupted]{.underline}
in December 2024, [the Finnish Border Guard]{.underline} quickly
[**detained** an oil tanker]{.underline} flying the Cook Islands flag

### Cables\-\--Internet Redundant\-\--1NC

**Both accidents and sabotage are harmless and are straight out of
Hollywood.**

**Eaton \'15** \[Joshua; reporter on the investigations team at Hearst
Connecticut Media Group, Correspondent for the Christian Science
Monitor; November 4, 2015; \"Why the Russian threat to undersea cables
is overblown,\" The Christian Science Monitor,
https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/2015/1104/Why-the-Russian-threat-to-undersea-cables-is-overblown\]//JC

[[Even if **Russian su**]{.mark}**b**marine**[s]{.mark}**
[clipped]{.mark} underwater]{.underline} communications [[cables, the
**Internet would survive**. The]{.mark} global [Internet operates on
enough]{.mark} undersea]{.underline} fiber-optic [[cables to **withstand
sabotage**]{.mark} from militaries, vandals, and errant
anchors]{.underline}.

It sounds like something from a Hollywood blockbuster -- Russian
submarines mapping the telephone and Internet cables under the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, ready to cut them at a moment's notice and leave
North America digitally stranded, cut off from the rest of the world.

But that's exactly what unnamed Pentagon officials say they worry could
be in the works, according to a New York Times article published last
week.

\"The ultimate Russian hack on the United States could involve severing
the fiber-optic cables at some of their hardest-to-access locations to
halt the instant communications on which the West's governments,
economies, and citizens have grown dependent,\" the Times reported.

Experts, however, say that scenario is highly unlikely. While secret
undersea cables used by the military might be at risk, [[the **dozens
of**]{.mark} **commercial [cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} beneath the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} an
**[[alternate route]{.underline}]{.mark}** in case one or two break. 

\"[[Cutting]{.mark} one or two]{.underline} \[submarine cables\] [[is
**not a big deal**]{.underline}]{.mark}, really,\" said Alan Mauldin,
director of research at TeleGeography, a Washington telecommunications
consulting firm. \"Also bear in mind [a lot of content is hosted in the
US in massive data centers, so [even if all the]{.mark} trans-Atlantic
[cables were cut, **you'd still be able to use Facebook**]{.mark} -- it
might be a bit **more challenging** for your friends in Europe to like
the **photos of your baby**]{.underline}.\"

Still, a network of fiber-optic cables does crisscross the world's
oceans, connecting countries and continents. Each cable is about three
inches thick. At its center are several fiber-optic fibers that transmit
data as pulses of red light. Submarine cables carry around 99 percent of
transoceanic communications, according to Mauldin.

That means 99 percent of telephone and Internet data that crosses an
ocean -- from Europe to the US, from Canada to Asia, from Iceland or
Australia to anywhere else -- travels through a thin strand of optical
fiber bundled into a cable and laid across the ocean floor.

Dozens of commercial cables cross the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
connecting the Americas to the rest of the world. Their locations are
well-known. The telecom market research firm TeleGeography publishes
an interactive map every year, and submarine cable locations are
also marked on nautical charts. The cables also tend to follow-long
established routes dictated by international agreements and undersea
conditions.

Thanks to Edward Snowden, we know that the US and Britain tap those
cables extensively. The practices dates back to at least the 1970s, when
a US submarine tapped a military submarine cable off the Russian coast.
The US even has a submarine, the USS Jimmy Carter, that
reportedly specializes in tapping undersea cables.

Sabotage is also common, according to a recent blog post by Doug Madory,
director of Internet Analysis at Dyn, a company that monitors Internet
performance. \"Unfortunately, [[**accidental** submarine]{.mark} cable
[**cuts**, along with]{.mark}]{.underline} acts of telecom
[[sabotage]{.underline}]{.mark}, occur with varying degrees of
regularity,\" Mr. Madory wrote. \"In either case, [[service is]{.mark}
generally **[restored]{.mark}**]{.underline} in hours, days or weeks
[[and]{.mark} **[life carries on]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

The Egyptian Navy caught divers cutting a submarine cable near
Alexandria in 2013. A submarine cable off the coast of Gabon, in West
Africa, suffered the same fate earlier this year. There was even
a string of sabotage to terrestrial fiber optic cables in the Bay Area
that drew attention from the FBI.

[[The biggest danger]{.mark} to submarine cables]{.underline}, however,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also the most
**[[mundane]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Ship anchors are responsible for the
majority of cable breaks. Natural disasters
like typhoons and earthquakes can even damage submarine cables. Then
there are accidents. In 2011, a 75-year-old woman in Georgia took all of
Armenia and parts of Georgia offline when she accidentally clipped a
terrestrial fiber-optic cable while scavenging for copper.

Many of those incidents were incredibly disruptive, knocking out
bandwidth for entire regions of the globe. But the sheer number of
cables connecting the US to the rest of the world means that traffic can
easily reroute around minor breaks to trans-Atlantic or trans-Pacific
cables, according to Mr. Mauldin.

Major damage to trans-Atlantic cables would be most disruptive to the
financial sector, which have grown to depend on quick global
communications, according to Madory. The Internet would route around the
damage quickly, and some of the difference could be made up with
satellite links, Madory wrote.

That was the case when Hurricane Sandy took major networks hubs offline
in 2012, according to an analysis of network traffic by Dyn. While the
storm took down some websites hosted in flooded Manhattan data centers,
the overall effect on global Internet traffic was negligible.

Rerouting traffic and switching to satellites couldn't replace the lost
bandwidth from a major submarine cable sabotage, according to Madory.
Still, he agreed with Mauldin that a scenario where someone cuts enough
submarine cables to significantly degrade US Internet access seems
impractical.

\"[[It]{.mark} would truly [take a **Hollywood scenario** to even
**temporarily degrade** the Internet for]{.mark}]{.underline} a country

### Cables\-\--Internet Redundant\-\--2NC

**Cable breaks are harmless.**

Fear,\" Internet Society Pulse,

Cable Breaks Are Common

[Around **[150 cable faults]{.mark}**]{.underline}---breakage or other
types of damage---[[occur]{.mark} globally [each year, and the industry
is]{.mark} **[always prepared]{.mark}** for them. [Repair kits
are]{.mark} kept [in ports]{.mark}, and]{.underline} when a cable is
damaged, [[one of]{.mark} the world's **[60 cable
ships]{.mark}**---there are always some on standby---[is
dispatched]{.mark} to]{.underline} pick up the kit and travel out to
lift the cable from the seabed and [repair it]{.underline}. 

Before the 2020s, cable incidents rarely received media attention unless
they were remarkable in some way. For example, in 2016, [[three]{.mark}
[cables]{.mark} in the English Channel]{.underline} that served the
island of Jersey [[were severed]{.underline}]{.mark} when a ship's
anchor dragged along the seabed. This cut the three main subsea
connections with the UK and left the island reliant on a single
connection with France. According to the BBC, users experienced slower
connections, but Cloudflare reported that the [[traffic was
**rerouted**]{.mark} through France relatively [quickly]{.mark}. Most
[reductions]{.mark} in speed]{.underline} for users probably
**[[resolved themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}** before the cable ship had
even picked up the repair kit. 

Until recently, the biggest myth the industry had to address was that
shark bites were a risk to cables (they aren't). In 2024, it seems
[[every]{.mark} subsea [cable fault]{.mark}]{.underline} without an
immediate and obvious explanation [[is met with **alarmist
language**]{.mark} from governments, which is [picked up by]{.mark} the
[media]{.mark}]{.underline}, looking for a good story about
international conflict [[rather than]{.mark} [listening to industry
experts]{.mark}]{.underline} like ESCA. 

If it does emerge that this most recent cable fault has a national
security dimension, the authorities might never be able to share it
fully. In this instance, it's also helpful to note that there was little
impact on the Internet for users. RIPE Labs reported that the traffic
was successfully rerouted, with a bit of extra latency but no meaningful
increase in packet loss.  

The Baltic Sea Context

The [[Baltic Sea countries]{.mark} have [been]{.mark} well-[served
by]{.mark}]{.underline} subsea cables since the mid-1990s when
[a]{.underline} combination of deregulation and post-Cold War activity
helped trigger a [[boom in cable construction]{.underline}]{.mark}
between the Nordic countries and the former East. 

The Baltic cables are mostly what are called "unrepeatered" systems.
These are used over shorter distances and don't need a repeater as an
internal power source, as the deep-sea cables that cross oceans do.
Using an unrepeatered system is usually determined by geography, but
these systems also provide extra route redundancy, which can lead to
increased resilience of the overall network. The C-Lion, damaged in this
incident, is one of the few repeatered systems in the Baltic, due to its
length, but there aren't many others.

The shorter-distance cables are powered from shoreline sheds and small
landing stations, which are often so unobtrusive that you might not
notice them. And while cable faults are common, it's also common for
cables to just sit on the seabed, doing their jobs, for decades. For
example, in the Baltic, the main Estonia-Sweden cable went live in 1995,
and until it was damaged by an anchor drag in 2023, there was no
evidence that it had ever needed a repair before. Mattias Fridström of
cable operator Arelion recently reported that it's performing at the
same levels as when it first launched almost three decades ago. 

Resilience is the Result of Continuous Human Activity

It's important not to dismiss security concerns, but telling stories of
resilience can help ensure that the combative language doesn't wholly
overshadow one of society's most critical infrastructures.   

From a distance, resilience can look like inertia and, therefore, not
much of a story. But [[**resilience** is]{.mark} incredibly
**[active]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} 

[[In the **cable industry**, it's]{.underline}]{.mark} the product of
things like [good route **[planning]{.mark}**, **[redundancy]{.mark}**,
proactive [**maintenance**, and]{.mark} ongoing **[repair
work]{.mark}**]{.underline}---because in a resilient system,
[[**fallibility is expected** and prepared]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline}. And it's all done by people, [[building
relationships]{.mark} and working together [in]{.mark} this]{.underline}
tight-knit, [[**highly collaborative** industry]{.underline}.]{.mark} 

**They happen daily and there is redundancy.**

**Burdette \'24** \[Lane; research analyst specializing in internet
infrastructure with a focus on submarine cables, data centers, and
public policy; 21 November 2024;
\"What To Know About Submarine Cable Breaks,\" Telegeography Blog,
https://blog.telegeography.com/what-to-know-about-submarine-cable-breaks\]//JC

How unusual are cable breaks?

[Submarine [cables break **all the time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
average, [[two to four break]{.underline}]{.mark} somewhere in the
world **[[every week]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

While damage is more common in some areas than others, [[these
breaks]{.underline}]{.mark}---or "faults"---[eventually [happen to
almost **every**]{.mark} **[cable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

If cables go out of service so often, why don't I hear about it?

Most of the time, cable faults only make the news if multiple systems go
offline or damage occurs in geopolitical hotspots. Simultaneous breaks
are more likely to affect service quality, and some islands may lose
their undersea connectivity altogether (like in the Shetland and Matsu
Islands).

You rarely hear about other cable faults because most [telecom
[providers follow]{.mark} a **["safety in numbers"]{.mark}**
approach]{.underline}.

[By **[spreading]{.mark}** their networks\' [**capacity** over multiple
cables]{.mark}, operators ensure that [if one breaks]{.mark}, [their
network]{.mark} will [run smoothly]{.mark}]{.underline} over the others
until the damage is repaired. 

To minimize downtime, [[cable owners]{.mark} also
[hold]{.mark}]{.underline} standing [[agreements with **maintenance
providers**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that keep ships on standby, [waiting
to deploy]{.mark} spares of [**extra cable length** and
make]{.mark}]{.underline} needed [[repairs]{.mark} quickly]{.underline}.

What causes cables to break?

Most faults are caused by "external aggression."

That sounds scary! But this term only means that a cable didn\'t suffer
a technical fault on its own, and was instead damaged by external
forces. Most come from fishing equipment, normal anchoring activity, and
natural disasters like undersea earthquakes. Internal component or
equipment failure causes another, smaller category of faults.

(In case you're wondering, no cable faults have been attributed to shark
bites since 2007.)

Although multiple cables breaking at the same time feels improbable,
it's more likely than you may think.

In some locations, geological or regulatory constraints herd cables into
narrow corridors, greatly increasing the risk of simultaneous cuts
across multiple cables. Across larger distances, multiple breaks can
happen through simple bad luck. 

Are cables ever damaged on purpose?

[State-sponsored [**sabotage** is **extremely
rare**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and most publicly [known [examples
are]{.mark} **decades old**]{.underline} (for example, [in
**[W]{.mark}**orld **[W]{.mark}**ar [**I** or]{.mark} [the
**Spanish-American War**]{.mark}]{.underline}).

**The threat is exaggerated.**

**Matsakis \'18** \[Louise; senior business editor at WIRED; previously
a staff writer at Semafor, a senior editor at Rest of World, and a staff
writer at WIRED; January 5, 2018; \"What Would Really Happen If Russia
Attacked Undersea Internet Cables,\" Wired,
https://www.wired.com/story/russia-undersea-internet-cables/\]//JC

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} idea of the [global [**internet** going dark
because]{.mark} some [**cables** were **damaged** is frightening.
But]{.mark} if Russia or anyone else were to snip]{.underline} a handful
of the [garden hose-sized lines, **experts** say that the [consequences
would]{.mark} likely [be **less severe**]{.mark}]{.underline} than the
picture the military paints. The world's internet infrastructure is
vulnerable, but [[Russia **doesn\'t present** the]{.mark} greatest
**[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are plenty of more complicated
problems, that start with understanding how the cable system actually
works.

"[The amount of [**anxiety** about]{.mark}]{.underline} somebody
[[sabotag]{.mark}ing]{.underline} a single cable or multiple [cables [is
**overblown**]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Nicole Starosielski, a
professor at New York University who spent six years studying internet
cables to write the The Undersea Network. "If somebody knew how these
systems worked and if they staged an attack in the right way, then they
could disrupt the entire system. But the likelihood of that happening is
very small. [[Most]{.mark} of the [concerns]{.mark} and fears [are
**not**]{.mark} **nearly [a threat]{.mark}** at all]{.underline}."

For one, [[ruptures **aren't**]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly [**[an
anomaly]{.mark}**. One of]{.underline} the estimated [428 undersea
cables worldwide is damaged every couple of days. [Nearly all]{.mark}
faults **[aren't intentional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They're caused by
underwater earthquakes, rock slides, anchors, and boats. That's not to
say that humans are incapable of purposefully messing with the cables;
off the coast of Vietnam in 2007, fishermen pulled up 27 miles of fiber
cords, disrupting service for several months. (It wasn\'t cut off
completely, because the country had one more cable that kept the
internet going.)

[You **don't notice** when a cable faults]{.underline}, especially [if
you live somewhere like the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
because [your]{.underline} Instagram [[message]{.underline}]{.mark} or
Google Voice call [[is instantly re-routed]{.underline}]{.mark}. If
you're Skyping with a friend in Romania for instance, and a fishing boat
or anchor ruptures a cable---as causes two-thirds of faults---[your
conversation simply goes over **another line**. Many regions, like
Europe, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
[and East Asia [have **numerous cables**]{.mark} running [over
the]{.mark} [same path]{.mark}]{.underline}. You can check out a map of
them all here.

That means [[Russia snipping a handful]{.mark} of cables]{.underline} in
the Atlantic, [where its submarines have been spotted, [would
**disturb**]{.mark} the global [internet **very
little**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [even if it ruptured every
single cable in the Atlantic]{.underline} Ocean, [traffic could still be
**re-routed**]{.underline} the other way, across the Pacific.

"It wouldn't work very well or be the highest quality, but [it's not
like there wouldn't be any communication happening]{.underline}," says
Alan Mauldin, research director at TeleGeography, a market research firm
that specializes in telecommunications, including undersea cables.

[[Even]{.mark} in a]{.underline} hypothetical, Black Mirror-esque [world
[in which Russia]{.mark} somehow **[chops every
cable]{.mark}**]{.underline} that connects to the United States [from
every side, [the **internet would not go out**]{.mark}]{.underline} like
a light. [[Americans would]{.mark} still be able to [utilize **land
networks**]{.mark}]{.underline} that connect the continent; it would
just be impossible to communicate overseas.

"**[[You can still email]{.underline}]{.mark}** people in the US [if all
submarine cables were gone]{.underline}," says Mauldin. "But [people in
Europe wouldn't see your silly cat video]{.underline} you posted on your
Facebook profile."

[Because faults happen so frequently, [**cable repair ships**
patrol]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly all of the world's waters. [Even if
Russia did start snipping, there are [crews]{.mark} equipped to
**[rapidly repair]{.mark}** them]{.underline}. Besides,
[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} epic hypothetical [cable
**[attack]{.mark}** [would primarily **harm its own
people**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as another Telegeography analyst pointed
out in a video. "It would hurt the Russians [perhaps even more
than]{.underline} it would hurt \[[Americans]{.underline}\]. [They're
far more dependent on international networks]{.underline} than we are,
because so much of [[our **content is stored
locally**]{.underline}]{.mark}" says senior analyst Jonathan Hjembo.

LONDON --- [[Ruptures of **undersea cables**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
have rattled European security officials in recent months [[were]{.mark}
likely the result of [**maritime accidents** rather than Russian
sabotage, according to]{.mark}]{.underline} several U.S. and European
[**[intelligence]{.mark}** officials]{.underline}.

[[The determination]{.mark} reflects [an **emerging
consensus**]{.mark}]{.underline} among U.S. and European security
services, according to senior officials from three countries involved
[[in ongoing investigations]{.mark} of a string of incidents [in
which]{.mark} critical seabed energy and communications [**lines** have
been **severed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The cases raised suspicion that Russia was targeting undersea
infrastructure as part of a broader campaign of hybrid attacks across
Europe, and prompted stepped-up security measures including an
announcement last week that NATO would launch new patrol and
surveillance operations in the Baltic Sea.

But [so far]{.underline}, officials said, investigations involving the
United States and a half-dozen [European **[security
services]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[turned up **no indication**
that]{.mark} commercial [ships]{.mark} suspected of [dragging]{.mark}
[anchors]{.mark}]{.underline} across seabed systems [[did so
intentionally]{.underline}]{.mark} or at the direction of Moscow.

Instead, U.S. and European [officials said that the
evidence]{.underline} gathered to date --- [including [intercepted
communications and]{.mark} other classified [intelligence]{.mark} ---
[points to]{.mark} accidents caused by **[inexperienced crews]{.mark}**
serving [aboard **poorly maintained** vessels]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[U.S. [**officials** cited **"clear explanations"**]{.mark} that have
come to light in each case indicating a likelihood that the damage was
accidental, [and]{.mark} a [lack of]{.mark}]{.underline} evidence
suggesting [[Russian culpability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Officials with
two European intelligence services said that they concurred with U.S.
assessments.

quantum computer by 2030 isn't just an ambitious scientific goal---it's
a direct challenge to the limits of current computing power. If
successful, it will mark the transition from experimental quantum
machines to large-scale, commercially useful quantum systems capable of
solving real-world problems at an unprecedented scale. Unlike today's
quantum computers, which operate with only a few hundred qubits and
struggle with stability, Google's vision is about breaking through the
barriers of error correction, scale, and real-world application. This is
a pivotal moment for industries worldwide because once a machine of this
magnitude is operational, the way we process data, develop new
materials, and secure information will change forever.

13\. IBM plans to release a 100,000-qubit quantum computer by 2033.
[[IBM's]{.mark} ambitious [goal]{.mark} to build a 100,000-qubit quantum

but a paradigm shift in how industries solve complex
problems]{.underline}. With this leap, IBM aims to move quantum
computing from an experimental technology to a commercially viable
powerhouse that businesses can integrate into their operations. Why
IBM's 100,000-Qubit Plan Matters for Businesses The current generation
of quantum computers is still limited in scope, with most operating in
the hundreds of qubits. A jump to 100,000 qubits could make quantum
computing practical for solving real-world challenges at scale.
[[This]{.mark} [could have]{.mark} **enormous [implications]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} industries reliant on **complex [simulations]{.mark},
[optimization]{.mark}, [and cryptography]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For
businesses, this milestone means: The ability to solve problems that are
currently beyond classical computing, such as real-time supply chain
optimization or personalized drug discovery. Faster breakthroughs in
materials science, enabling the creation of ultra-efficient batteries,
superconductors, and next-generation semiconductors. A revolution in
cybersecurity, as quantum computing will both break existing encryption
and create new forms of unbreakable security. Companies that position

successful demonstration of quantum entanglement over 1,200 kilometers
by China's Micius satellite isn't just a scientific milestone---it's a
game-changer for global cybersecurity, communications, and the future of
quantum networks. For businesses, this achievement marks the dawn of
ultra-secure quantum communications. Unlike traditional encryption,
which can eventually be cracked with enough computing power, quantum
entanglement enables completely secure data transmission. Any attempt to
intercept quantum-encrypted messages disturbs the quantum state, making
eavesdropping virtually impossible.

15\. D-Wave has sold over 200 quantum annealers. Why D-Wave's 200+
Quantum Annealers Matter for Businesses D-Wave isn't just a player in
the quantum computing race---it's a company that has already
commercialized its technology. Unlike competitors focused on universal
quantum computing, D-Wave specializes in quantum annealing, a method
particularly suited for optimization problems. Selling over 200 quantum
annealers is a testament to D-Wave's early mover advantage and
real-world applicability. While other companies are working toward
large-scale quantum breakthroughs, D-Wave's technology is already in use
by enterprises looking to solve complex logistical, financial, and
operational challenges. This means businesses don't have to wait for a
futuristic quantum computer---they can start leveraging quantum power
today.

16\. [**[The number of patents]{.mark}** filed for quantum technologies
**globally [surpassed 5,000]{.mark} in 2023.** [Patents are a critical
indicator of innovation]{.mark}, and the fact that over 5,000
quantum-related patents have been filed shows how **fiercely
competitive** this industry has become.]{.underline} Countries and
companies are racing to protect their discoveries and gain a
technological edge. For businesses looking to enter the quantum space,
securing intellectual property (IP) should be a top priority. Filing
patents early can prevent competitors from gaining control over key
innovations. Investors should also assess patent portfolios before
backing quantum startups---companies with strong IP have a higher
likelihood of success.

17\. [Quantum computing venture capital [funding has grown]{.mark} at a
compound **annual growth rate of [50%]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 2015.
The qu[antum computing sector is **[attracting]{.mark} an increasing
amount of [venture capital]{.mark}** (VC)
**[funding]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With a 50% CAGR in VC investment,
quantum startups are raising significant capital, making it one of the
fastest-growing areas in tech. If you're an entrepreneur in the quantum
space, now is the best time to secure funding. However, with so much
money flowing in, competition is high. To stand out, startups must
clearly articulate their commercial viability and demonstrate how their
quantum solutions can be applied to real-world problems.

18\. [[The U.S. is home to]{.mark} over [50% of]{.mark} all

Current quantum computing technology remains nascent, with a projected
5-10 years before commercialization. As a result, much of the ecosystem
is focused on research and development towards the creation of a
commercially-viable, fault-tolerant quantum computing system.
[Currently, [the]{.mark} top [two countries in quantum]{.mark} computing
[are the **United States and China**]{.mark}. [The United States
maintains advantages in]{.mark} **first-mover and private sector
[innovation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} international [collaboration]{.mark};
however, [China's]{.mark} massive government investment and policy
strategy [suggest an **intensifying race**]{.mark} for quantum
advantage.]{.underline}

[[The United States holds a]{.mark}]{.underline} commanding
[[lead]{.mark} in demonstrating]{.underline} practical [[**quantum
advantages** and]{.mark}]{.underline} building [a **[robust
innovation]{.mark} ecosystem**]{.underline}. In addition to showcasing
quantum advantages for scientific progress in drug discovery, [U.S.
**companies are making progress** towards]{.underline} fault tolerant
[computing]{.underline} with Microsoft's recent development of 12
entangled logical qubits [marking a **significant step in error
correction** of quantum computers.]{.underline}\[1\] [[The
United]{.mark} [States]{.mark} continues to **[dominate]{.mark} in [many
of the top quantum]{.mark} computing [modalities]{.mark}**]{.underline},
building on foundational algorithms like Shor's Algorithm developed by
American researchers.

However, [[China]{.mark} has [made]{.mark} notable
[strides]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly on building upon existing
quantum theoretical breakthroughs and patent application filings. While
U.S. researchers demonstrated time crystals within a quantum system in
2021\[2\] --- an achievement that may help to create a room-temperature
quantum computer --- a PRC research team successfully actualized room
temperature time crystals in 2024.\[3\] [[China]{.mark} also now [leads
in production of quantum]{.mark} computing [papers]{.mark}, accounting
for 22.8% of global papers compared to the United States' 21.3%;
[however, further analysis reveals]{.mark} that **[the U.S.
publishes]{.mark} significantly [more high-impact]{.mark},
[meaningful]{.mark} quantum computing
[research]{.mark}**.\[]{.underline}4\]

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has largely [[focused on]{.mark} quantum
[communications]{.mark}]{.underline}, but has since established quantum
computing as a strategic priority since 2021, outlining it in the 14th
Five-Year Plan.\[5\] [[Meanwhile]{.mark} in [the United States]{.mark},
Congress [passed the]{.mark} [National Quantum Initiative Act]{.mark} in
2018 [which]{.mark} for the first time [created a **coordinated,
federal-level effort** to advance quantum]{.mark} information science
and technology.]{.underline} .\[6\]

[[The United States leads]{.mark} decisively [in **private sector
engagement**]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} approximately [300]{.mark} quantum
[startups compared to China's 30, and 320 quantum investors versus
China's 50]{.mark}.\[7\] This vibrant private ecosystem also complements
research efforts from U.S. public research institutions. China's quantum
development remains heavily centralized around state institutions, like
the University of Science and Technology of [China]{.mark} (USTC),
though it has produced notable achievements through private companies
like Origin Quantum. They've [produced]{.mark} the [Wukong
system]{.mark}, [but this]{.mark} system [falls]{.mark} [short
of]{.mark} systems produced by [top U.S. companies]{.mark}, like IBM's
1000-qubit Condor supercomputer.\[8\]]{.underline}

Government funding shows China's strategic prioritization of quantum
technology, with projected investments of \$15 billion compared to the
U.S.'s \$4 billion.\[9\] However, when including private sector
investment of the two countries, the gap narrows significantly.
[[The]{.mark} [United States]{.mark} has [secured]{.mark} approximately
[\$3.7 billion]{.mark} in private quantum funding [versus China's \$255
million.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Quantum\-\--Loss Inevitable\-\--1NC

#### US strategy [loses]{.underline} the quantum race against China

Duncan **Earl 23**, \[Earl received a PhD in electrical and computer
engineering, a BS in engineering physics, and an MS in physics from the
University of Tennessee and works as a Senior Director of Quantum
Networking at IonQ.\], 5-8-2023, \"Why the US needs a \'quantum
Oppenheimer\' to beat China in the quantum race\", Physics World,
https://physicsworld.com/a/why-the-us-needs-a-quantum-oppenheimer-to-beat-china-in-the-quantum-race/
// shaka

In both political and scientific circles, some are quick to dismiss
China's recent progress, viewing Chinese publications with scepticism
and asserting that the country is a "paper tiger". [Yet a closer
examination of published Chinese quantum research reveals a level of
detail, results and collaboration with western researchers that suggest
the tiger has teeth. [The Chinese are]{.mark} indeed [prioritizing and
dominating]{.mark} the [quantum]{.mark} space, [with]{.mark} every
[intention of winning this]{.mark} technology
[race]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[China's rapid progress is [even more worrisome]{.mark} for the US [when
one considers that America was well ahead]{.mark} of China in quantum
technology [at the turn of the century]{.mark}. This [reversal has been
attributed to]{.mark} reduced US federal **[funding]{.mark}** for
quantum research between 2005 and 2015.]{.underline}

[[However, this]{.mark} explanation [oversimplifies]{.mark} the US's
[failures and]{.mark} also [does not give China credit for its own
advances]{.mark}.]{.underline} Inevitably, the situation is lamented in
the US, with concerns ranging from China developing a quantum computer
capable of cracking our most secure codes, to advanced Chinese military
and industrial capabilities that vastly outpace our own.

Given China's steady commitment and progress, the conversation in the US
must now turn to asking serious questions about our level of commitment
and about the need to create a timeline for accelerating the US quantum
programme. Such discussions must focus on near-term defence, industry
participation and policy actions that directly address the question: how
can the US catch -- and overtake -- China in the quantum race?

A "quantum tsar"

In 2019 the US authorized \$1.3bn of federal funding over five years for
quantum research and development. [The majority of the money goes to the
national laboratories and academic universities for research, developing
new quantum curricula, building quantum testbeds and growing the quantum
workforce. These national laboratories and universities, in turn, are
expected to engage industry partners to foster a [US]{.mark} quantum
industry with access to private investment leading to
commercialization.]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, this strategy is based on three **[flawed
assumptions]{.mark}** -- all related to timing. First, we have a "let
100 flowers bloom" strategy that [assumes]{.mark} the US has [ample
time]{.mark} to explore, mature [and]{.mark} then trim unfruitful paths
from a diverse cornucopia of quantum solutions.]{.underline}

[Second, it assumes [that the]{.mark} nation's national
[lab]{.mark}oratorie[s and]{.mark} independent academic [organizations
will advance quantum]{.mark} technology [at a pace that]{.mark} matches,
or even [**exceeds**, Chinese competitors. And]{.mark} third, it
[assumes billions of dollars in private investment to transition
research]{.mark} into mature, [market-driven
solutions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [Chinese quantum]{.mark} programme, in contrast, [is led]{.mark} by
quantum physicist Jian-Wei Pan [and]{.mark} is [managed by a]{.mark}
tightly [**co-ordinated group** of academic, government and industry
partners.]{.mark} The programme is well resourced, [with an annual
budget]{.mark} estimated to be [in the **billions**]{.mark} of dollars,
[and]{.mark} has the full [support of the C]{.mark}hinese
[C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty. The US's quantum race with China
could be compared in some ways to the race to develop nuclear technology
in the 1940s.]{.underline}

[Witnesses at a Capitol Hill]{.underline} [hearing]{.underline} today
[called for increased investment]{.underline} [in quantum
technology]{.underline} by the Federal government [amid concerns about
recent]{.underline} government science and [**technology cuts**
and]{.underline} [the future of the **N**ational **Q**uantum
**I**nitiative **A**ct]{.underline}.

During a House Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing on
Wednesday, lawmakers and witnesses alike stressed the importance of
reauthorizing research and development activities under the National
Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA). The law approved by Congress in 2018
established a Federal program to accelerate quantum research and
development.

"[The global quantum race]{.underline} [is more than
academic]{.underline} -- [it is a competition for 21st
century]{.underline} [technological supremacy]{.underline} [with **major
implications** for America's economic strength and]{.underline} our
[national security]{.underline}," said committee Chairman Rep. Brian
Babin, R-Texas, in his opening statements.

Witnesses and lawmakers also warned that [competing in that quantum
race]{.underline} [will require investment]{.underline} [from **outside
of the government**]{.underline} -- [especially after]{.underline}
recent science and technology [**funding cuts** from]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration.

"The administration claims to support quantum research funding in its
budget proposal, but in practice, the president is actively cutting
fields of research and STEM training programs that underpin our nation's
quantum industry," said Ranking Member Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.

"I think [we're **fooling ourselves**]{.underline} [if we
think]{.underline} [we can support]{.underline} [quantum
leadership]{.underline} [while helping to **destroy the workforce** that
**feeds into** the quantum industry]{.underline}," she said.

[budget]{.underline} [proposal]{.underline} released last week [slashed
NSF's]{.underline} current [budget **in half**]{.underline}, while only
maintaining current funding levels for programs related to artificial
intelligence and quantum. The agency's director, Sethuraman
Panchanathan, also announced in late April his decision to step down
from his role after five years.

### Quantum\-\--No Quantum Race\-\--1NC

#### Quantum race exaggerated\-\--quantum limited now, cooperation better than competition.

Dan **Garisto** **23**. \[A free-lance science journalist who reports
primarily about physics for a variety of publications. "Quantum tech

NRout

[Claims that quantum tech will]{.underline} help [solve climate change
are so hyperbolic]{.underline} that [they should be categorised as snake
oil.]{.underline}

Three decades later, [the fear that [quantum]{.mark}]{.underline}
computers [will destroy digital security]{.underline} is still
frequently invoked as an argument for quantum computers, or quantum
communications technology like Micius which would protect against. But
[these **[concerns lack]{.mark} crucial [context]{.mark}**. Currently,
quantum]{.underline} computers [have]{.underline}, at most, [a few
hundred error-prone qubits]{.underline} (the quantum analog to bits). In
2019, [an attempt to factor the number 35 using a quantum computer
failed because of these errors]{.underline}. Estimates vary, but most
analyses find that millions of qubits will be needed to implement
Shor\'s algorithm to break public key encryption, which uses numbers
much, much larger than 35. (Moreover, computer [[scientists have already
identified]{.mark} [encryption]{.mark}]{.underline} schemes that are
[[resistant to quantum attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}, and will be rolling
them out soon.)

These caveats apply broadly to [[quantum tech]{.underline}]{.mark}: it
[[is **error-prone**, requires]{.mark} tremendous [scaling, and
is]{.mark}]{.underline} vastly [[outperformed by
existing]{.underline}]{.mark} classical [[solutions. Quantum computers
have **no near-term uses**]{.underline}]{.mark} for banks, hospitals, or
airlines. Claims that quantum tech will help solve climate change are so
hyperbolic that they should be categorised as snake oil.

\... if quantum tech is in its infancy, [it should not be viewed in the
same light as]{.underline} semiconductors and [other currently critical
technology.]{.underline}

Hype around quantum tech and impact on geopolitics

All this hype around quantum tech has distorted attempts to fit it into
geopolitical analysis. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, for
example, included quantum computing as a \"crucial area\" in its
assessment of 44 technologies - alongside categories like vaccines,
semiconductors, and AI. During a US congressional hearing, \"Advancing
American Leadership in Quantum Technology\", members of Congress raised
similar concerns to a panel of experts, asking about export controls on
quantum tech, China\'s progress with a quantum network, and why the US
hadn\'t launched a competitor to Micius.

The fact that the [[US has fallen behind in]{.mark} this area of
[quantum]{.mark}]{.underline} tech [[is of little
consequence]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Some discussions of quantum technology include caveats to temper the
hype. A Foreign Policy op-ed from March titled \"The U.S. Wants to Make
Sure China Can\'t Catch Up on Quantum Computing\" notes that \"the field
is still in its infancy and current quantum [computers are error prone
and **lack any real applications**]{.underline}\". But the piece does
not grapple with what this means: if [[quantum tech is in its
infancy]{.underline}]{.mark}, it should not be viewed in the same light
as semiconductors and other currently critical technology.

In this way, the comparison of Micius to Sputnik is actually helpful.
During the \'60s, the ensuing space race changed the relationship
between the US and the USSR. Rocketry revolutionised warfare and
communications. The advent of GPS even changed how we do agriculture.
With the eventual arrival of humans on the Moon, the space race changed
our place in the cosmos. [It has been seven years]{.underline} since
Micius launched [and nothing like this has happened]{.underline}. The
fact that the US has fallen behind in this area of quantum tech is of
little consequence. After all, from a pragmatic user\'s perspective,
Micius did not do anything new. Encrypted video calls are commonplace to
millions of Zoom users every day.

More recently, China has leapt ahead in the development of photonic
quantum computers. Again, \"computer\" is a misnomer - these devices are
constructed with an intricate arrangement of lasers and mirrors to
create a racetrack for photons, particles of light. Because of this,
they can solve only a limited type of problems. In May, a team at the
University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) published their
latest results: it took their photonic quantum computer less than a
second to solve a problem that would have taken a classical
supercomputer five years. Amazing! The US, meanwhile, having specialised
in other kinds of quantum computing architectures, is not that focused
on photonic quantum computers. The gap does not seem to matter in the
grand scheme of things.

[[Relegating quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} tech [[to the same degree of
secrecy and concern as]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear weapons or [[other
military technology would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely prevent this,
[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to **less healthy competition**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, quite possibly, **[[slower
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The lack of practical implications does not mean quantum tech is
scientifically uninteresting - far from it. Researchers like the
scientists at USTC are continually learning new things about the
theoretical computer science that governs the way we solve problems, and
the physical systems that quantum tech is built on. From my perspective
as a physics journalist, some of the most productive and exciting
scientific advances in the past few years have been in quantum tech. The
back-and-forth battle to see whether [quantum]{.underline} computers or
classical computers are faster at solving a problem like generating
random numbers, for instance, [is scientifically fascinating. As a
matter of practical technology, **it\'s useless**]{.underline}.

Science cooperation

[Seen [as science and not a deployable tech]{.mark}nology,
[quantum]{.mark}]{.underline} tech [[has a]{.mark} vastly [different
role on the geopolitical stage]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Science
has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[far [greater room for
collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}** -
[[researchers]{.underline}]{.mark} at academic institutions correspond
and work together, [[foster]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[ties that can be
used for diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US and China have
maintained strong research ties for decades, thanks in part to a 1979
agreement between the two governments that has enabled researchers to
work together. In spite of recent tensions, the US and China remain each
others\' primary research partners.

As discussions about quantum tech\'s geopolitical relevance continue,
it\'s worth keeping the scientific side in mind. [[Quantum researchers
from the US and China]{.mark} still [benefit from **open
channels**]{.mark} of communication.]{.underline} Relegating quantum
tech to the same degree of secrecy and concern as nuclear weapons or
other military technology would likely prevent this, leading to less
healthy competition, and, quite possibly, slower progress.

Quantum technologies are poised to transform society.

[In the coming]{.underline} [years]{.underline}, [quantum
developments]{.underline} [could]{.underline} produce sensors capable of
detecting disease at the very earliest stages; networks that offer
provably secure financial and medical record transfers; and eventually
computers that could, in just minutes, [perform analyses]{.underline}

But the [**legal** and **regulatory systems**]{.underline} [surrounding
these innovations]{.underline} [are]{.underline} still [**taking
shape**,]{.underline} raising questions about whether existing laws can
address [concerns around intellectual]{.underline}
[property]{.underline}, antitrust, [liability, privacy and
more]{.underline}. At the same time, policymakers must weigh how to
protect U.S. interests without stifling the international collaboration
that's vital to the field's progress. Researchers who rely on foreign
equipment, international talent and cross-border collaborations already
face obstacles that some worry could impede progress.

These were among the issues [discussed]{.underline} [at]{.underline} a
panel organized by [the]{.underline} **[Chicago Quantum
Exchange]{.underline}** (CQE) last month at the University of Chicago
Law School.

The event, which focused most heavily on how the law should balance
global collaboration and the protection of U.S. interests, brought three
leading UChicago faculty together: David Awschalom, the Liew Family
Professor of Molecular Engineering and Physics at UChicago's Pritzker
School of Molecular Engineering, senior scientist at Argonne National
Laboratory, and director of the CQE; Aziz Huq, the Frank and Bernice J.
Greenberg Professor of Law; and Lior Strahilevitz, the Sidley Austin
Professor of Law.

The discussion was moderated by Robert W. Karr Jr., a partner at Barnes
& Thornburg LLP who co-chairs the firm's Quantum Technology Industry
Group.

[The panel marked the start]{.underline} [of a **broader effort**
to]{.underline} [explore]{.underline} [how]{.underline} legal and
[regulatory frameworks can **support** U.S. **quantum
research**]{.underline}, [commercialization and workforce
development]{.underline}. The work will include contributions by
industry experts, legal scholars, scientists and others.

"Quantum technology is in a critical place right now as applications
approach commercial viability," Awschalom said after the event. "The
field's enormous technological and economic potential is within view,
and the science is advancing more rapidly than expected. [Now is the
time]{.underline} [for conversations]{.underline} [about how
we]{.underline} can [**balance protection** and
**collaboration**]{.underline} in a way that encourages, not stifles,
innovation."

[Existing U.S. regulations aimed]{.underline} [at quantum
technologies]{.underline} often [focus on interactions]{.underline}
[with the **rest of world**]{.underline}---how we share and review
ideas, educate and hire talent, fund joint projects and exchange goods.
[The U.S. has entered into **bilateral agreements** with]{.underline}
nearly [**a dozen** countries]{.underline} [and]{.underline} has
[coordinated export controls]{.underline} with those and others.

But even [the 2018 **N**ational **Q**uantum **I**nitiative

a **comprehensive regulatory regime**]{.underline}.

Some [regulations have been implemented]{.underline}, [including
**export controls**]{.underline} on quantum technologies [and
**encryption standards**]{.underline} aimed at [protecting government
agencies]{.underline} and contractors from future quantum-enabled

[Per the BBC, there are now [efforts to mitigate the risk of

**[distributed acoustic sensing]{.mark}** (DAS).]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} approach **[detects disturbances]{.mark}** in fibre optic

How fibre optics can \'listen\' for threats

As with network security, where businesses rely on the best small
business routers to prevent cyber threats, monitoring solutions for
subsea infrastructure are becoming essential in safeguarding global
communications.

Lane Burdette, a research analyst at TeleGeography, notes that the
number of faults affecting subsea cables each year has remained steady,
typically between 1 and 200. \"Cables break all the time...The number of
cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several
years.\"

During tests conducted by AP Sensing, the system detected a diver
patting a cable on the seabed, while further experiments demonstrated
its ability to identify drones and vessels, potentially providing early
warnings of sabotage attempts.

\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the
signal\...The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is
basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance,\" says
Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology
company.

Just as businesses depend on the best business smartphones for real-time
alerts and security updates, early warning systems for subsea cables can
provide critical intelligence to prevent disruptions.

[[Concerns over]{.mark} the vulnerability of these [cables]{.mark} have
[led NATO to launch **\"Baltic Sentry,\"** a mission using warships,
drones, and aircraft to]{.mark} monitor activity in the
region]{.underline}, but since constant surveillance is not always
possible, demand for fibre optic acoustic sensing solutions is growing.

[\"It\'s good that [Nato and]{.mark} the [E]{.mark}uropean

quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" said Thorsten
Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy
Institute.]{.underline}

Maintaining secure communications in this environment requires the same
level of reliability as the best network switches, ensuring smooth data
flow and minimal disruption.

#### Cables have [structural mechanisms]{.underline} that prevent disruptions

**[[Designed to handle interruptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[Built-in **redundancy** means]{.mark} internet [traffic can take
**many paths**]{.mark} to get [from point A to]{.mark} point [B]{.mark}.
If the shortest path suddenly becomes unusable, for example after a
cable break, the routers through which the traffic passes can find an
**alternative path**.]{.underline}

["Cable breaks are **relatively common** even under normal
circumstances. In terrestrial networks, they can be caused by various
factors, such as excavators working near the fiber installation and
accidentally cutting it]{.underline}. In submarine cables, cuts can
occur, for example due to irresponsible use of anchors, as we have seen
in recent reports," says Furdek Prekratic.

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

[Network operators ensure that **[individual]{.mark} cable [breaks do
not lead to widespread disruptions]{.mark}**, she notes: "Optical fiber
[networks rely on two]{.mark} main [mechanisms]{.mark} to **handle such
events** without causing a noticeable disruption to public transport.
The [first is]{.mark} called **[protection]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
moment an optical connection is established over a physical path between
two endpoints, resources are also allocated to another connection that
takes a completely different path between the same endpoints.
[[If]{.mark} a [failure occurs]{.mark} on any link along the primary
path, the [transmission]{.mark} quickly [switches to]{.mark} the
[secondary]{.mark} [path]{.mark}. The [second]{.mark} mechanism
[is]{.mark} called **[failover]{.mark}**. Here, the [secondary
path]{.mark} is not reserved in advance, but is [determined after the
primary path has suffered a failure]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[Operators]{.mark} typically [combine these two]{.mark} mechanisms [to
ensure]{.mark} access to a backup path via [protection]{.mark} and
provide the opportunity for additional flexibility via recovery, says
Furdek Prekratic.]{.underline}

"All of this is implemented in the optical layer that transports
aggregated traffic from the upper network layers, so that the protocols
in the upper network layers do not even perceive the change in the
underlying topology. [[This **speeds up recovery**]{.mark} without
requiring updates in, for example, routing tables."]{.underline}

https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/02/26/u-s-quantum-industry-pushing-for-more-federal-support-appointing-a-quantum-czar/

The [**[House Science Committee advanced]{.mark}** **a reauthorization
[bill]{.mark}** last Congress,]{.underline}
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Stimers said the industry
[expects]{.underline} [the Senate Commerce Committee]{.underline} [and
Senate Energy and Natural Resources]{.underline} Committee [to follow
suit]{.underline}. In early February, it was reported that **[the U.S[.
Senate is advancing]{.mark}]{.underline}** a bipartisan bill[, the
**[DOE Quantum Leadership Act]{.mark} of 2025**]{.underline},
[[to]{.mark} [expand quantum research with **over \$2.5
billion**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [coalition also advocates for a "quantum czar"]{.underline} who
would act as a champion for the industry across government.

"The quantum czar is something that the president can do on his own,"
Stimers said. "This would be more of an outside-facing,
rest-of-government-facing position. It doesn't have to be official.
[It]{.underline} can be relatively informal but [would have the role of
helping get the entire federal government on board with
quantum."]{.underline}

Political Landscape and Support

Stimers indicated confidence that [**[the government]{.mark}** will
[continue **prioritizing quantum** development]{.mark}.]{.underline}
While he [[noted]{.underline}]{.mark} that he is not in direct contact
with the President, he pointed [to [bipartisan recognition of
quantum's]{.mark} strategic [importance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"I'm not in a position to say one way or another what we're hearing from
the people I write to," Stimers said, as reported by Politico. "But what
we can say publicly is that we're [[pleased]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
level of [attention]{.mark} that [quantum]{.mark} has already [gotten
from]{.mark} this administration and [leaders in this
Congress]{.mark}."]{.underline}

He also identified key figures in the administration who could help push
quantum efforts forward, including National Security Advisor [**[Tim
Waltz,]{.mark}** who he said is likely to [**promote quantum**
because]{.mark} of its [use in potential **military
applications**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Stimers noted that [[**quantum**
computing, sensors and]{.mark} **[networking]{.mark}** [have broad
**support as national security priorities**]{.mark}, on par with
artificial intelligence and hypersonics.]{.underline}

"I have heard no serious suggestion for becoming second \[to China\] on
quantum technology," Stimers said. "Everybody readily understands that
quantum computing, quantum clocks and sensors, quantum networking,
quantum communication and post-quantum cryptography are critically
important from a national security perspective.

The Debate Over Government's Role

One of the challenges in quantum policy is determining how much direct
intervention the government should have in picking winners and losers.
Stimers said that rather than placing large bets on specific
applications, the government should focus on ensuring that federal
agencies integrate quantum technology into their missions. He pointed to
the NQI reauthorization bill's provisions requiring agencies like the
Department of Agriculture and the NSA to assess how quantum could
benefit their operations.

Another concern is the loss of technical expertise across government due
to staff reductions at agencies like the National Science Foundation,
which play a critical role in translational research. While Stimers
acknowledged that some disruption is happening, [he said he expects
quantum to remain a national priority.]{.underline}

"I expect that [areas like [**quantum**]{.mark} that are [of
**significant** **national priority for the U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates** will turn out to be priorities when all is said and
done,"]{.underline} Stimers told Politico.

#### Redundancy and repair capacity [solve]{.underline} cable risks

undersea cable redundancy and repair capacity\], 5-20-2025, \"How

// shaka

["[Cables break **all the time**]{.mark}, [usually as a]{.mark} result
of [accidents. We can't stop that]{.mark}. The [system solves]{.mark} it
[by]{.mark} having [**redundancy** and **repair
capacity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A few possible sabotages don't change
that situation. The British's first action in the First World War was to
fish out and cut off German communication cables. [[This is not
new]{.mark} and the risks are taken into account. By and large, the
industry has made a **reasonable risk assessment**]{.underline}."

\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>\>

Other parts of the Nordic region, such as Iceland and Svalbard, are more
vulnerable: "They have lower redundancy, repair times are longer and the
number of satellites is more limited, so there are fewer emergency
options," says Liwång.

Another region where cable breaks can have major consequences is the Red
Sea. Seventeen cables pass through the 30-mile-wide Bab al-Mandab Strait
between Djibouti and Yemen. In the spring of 2024, four Red Sea cables
broke in a short period of time.

"The Red Sea cables provide a very important high-bandwidth, low-latency
link between Europe and Asia. When cables were recently cut there,
25--70 percent of all traffic between the continents was affected," says
Furdek Prekratic.

Along the eastern side of the sea, fighting is ongoing between Houthi
rebels and Yemeni government forces. The rebels have attacked ships
linked to Israel. They have not claimed responsibility for the cable
breaks, but that has not stopped speculation. Whether the cables were
cut or damaged accidentally complicates the repair of the security
situation in the region.

More generally, it can be difficult to base your decisions on maps of
submarine cables, says Furdek Prekratic. There are areas with few such
cables that still have very good connections to surrounding countries
via cables on land, which are buried and better protected.

[For Sweden, Hans Liwång does not believe that [cable sabotage is what
we **should focus on**]{.mark}: "The [cables]{.mark} are vulnerable, but
that **[doesn't mean our internet access is vulnerable]{.mark}**. There
is no need to protect every cable, [we need to ensure]{.mark} that the
**function is protected**. That is by making sure we have **[good
redundancy]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

[The [latest attempt at]{.mark} laying an [Arctic cable is **Polar
Connect**]{.mark}]{.underline} - a project with similar ambitions (and a
confusingly similar name) to its predecessors, but one that is taking a
slightly different direction.

[It [intends]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [lay]{.mark} **a [cable directly
through]{.mark}** the **[polar ice sheet]{.mark}**]{.underline}, passing
west of the geographical North Pole. [The [route would run from
Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline} via Norway and [Svalbard [through]{.mark}
the [North Pole to]{.mark} Japan, South Korea, and the
[Asia-Pacific]{.mark} region via the Bering Strait between Alaska and
Russia, [with **landing points in the US**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
too. The 10,000km cable will pass under some 2,000km of thick ice, with
[a target launch date of 2030.]{.underline}

Polar Connect is being [[planned by NORDUnet]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
Nordic regional research and education network serving academics in
Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland.

Erik-Jan Bos, senior advisor at NORDUnet, is overseeing the project, and
says [[it is designed to enable]{.mark} more **[efficient and resilient
data sharing]{.mark}** [between]{.mark}]{.underline} Europe and [[the
rest of the world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is hoped this will help bolster Europe's R&D efforts and the
continent's economy. [On a political level, Bos says [there is buy-in at
both ends of the route]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Japan and South Korea are
definitely interested because we need a direct path from Europe to Asia
for digital sovereignty and autonomy reasons," he says.

Bos says Polar Connect was first conceived a decade ago under the name
Borealis, but was considered infeasible at the time.
[NORDUnet]{.underline} decided to revisit the idea after the other
Arctic cable projects sunk, and [has spent the last 18 months carrying
out studies]{.underline} to determine whether they can make their plan a
reality. So far, the answer seems to be... maybe. A Northern EU Gateways
project report from the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat (SPRS)
looking into the plans suggests deployment of Polar Connect will require
three ships; two heavy icebreakers (at Polar Class 2) and an
ice-strengthened cable laying ship. "We need the two icebreakers so that
the cable-laying ship can go about its business safely," Bos says.

Icebreakers are required because of the sheer thickness of the ice that
Polar Connect intends to slice through. Some arctic icebergs reach the
ocean floor, the SPRS report says: "Ice conditions in this area are
among the toughest in the world," it notes. While fresh ice can be
relatively easy to cut, multi-year ice, which has thawed and refrozen
several times, can be harder than concrete, the report says.

The problem is, the ships needed by Polar Connect for this sizeable task
do not all exist yet. When it comes to icebreakers, the Swedish
Government currently owns a vessel, the Oden, that would be suitable for
assisting a cable-laying ship in the Arctic. It is planning to
commission a second imminently, known as the Swedish Heavy Polar
Research Vessel (SHPRV), which it hopes to receive by 2028. A third
icebreaker may even be needed as a backup, the Northern Gateways report
says.

At present, there is also no cable-laying ship suitable for the extreme
conditions of Arctic waters. The report suggests converting an existing
icebreaker, as this could be "significantly more cost-efficient" than
building a new ship. Finnish crafts Fennica and Nordica have been
identified as possible candidates for conversion. The SPRS report
explains that in the cable laying operation, the SHPRV would lead the
way, performing reconnaissance and initial cutting of the ice. The Odin
would follow, ensuring the way was clear for the cable-laying ship,
which would travel at the back of the convoy.

How this complicated-sounding operation will be paid for remains to be
seen[, but **[the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion** [is]{.mark}
certainly [throwing its weight behind Polar
Connect]{.mark},]{.underline} and in December 2024[, announced
[it]{.mark} had [awarded]{.mark} the project [€4 million]{.mark}
(\$4.22m) [to carry out mapping]{.mark}]{.underline} of the seabed in
the Arctic Ocean.

"All the oceans in the world have been mapped in detail apart from the
Arctic\"

Erik-Jan Bos

This is something, Bos says, that has never been done before on the
required scale. "All the oceans in the world have been mapped in detail
apart from the Arctic," he says. "It remains largely unknown because
it's extremely difficult to do. [We are [planning to go]{.mark} there
[on expeditions over]{.mark} the [next two years]{.mark} and collect
bathymetry information."]{.underline}

Bathymetry information is that relating to the depth of an ocean, and
thanks to the EU funding, the Polar Connect team will have access to the
Oden to carry out its mission. Ieva Muraškienė, strategy, and policy
officer at NORDUnet, says the bathymetry detail will be key to
finalizing the route for Polar Connect.

"It's extremely important to get this data to have an understanding of
where the safe path for the cable is," Muraškienė says. "We already have
some information about ridges and seismic activity, and there's a whole
continent underwater, which is relatively safe because it's flat. But
there might also be things like mountain slopes where you don't really
want to be putting a cable."

While the [[Polar Connect]{.underline}]{.mark} team grapples with the
physical challenges of laying cables through one of the most remote and
unknown parts of the world, it [[will]{.mark} also [be mindful of the

#### New standards [minimize dangers]{.underline}.

Chad **Boutin 24**, science writer at National Institute of Standards
and Technology, \"NIST Releases First 3 Finalized Post-Quantum
Encryption Standards\",
https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/08/nist-releases-first-3-finalized-post-quantum-encryption-standards,
8-12-2024//ILake-AW

GAITHERSBURG, Md. --- [The U.S. Department of Commerce's National
Institute of Standards and Technology]{.underline}
(**[NIST]{.underline}**) has [finalized its]{.underline} principal [set
of **encryption algorithms**]{.underline} designed [to **withstand
cyberattacks**]{.underline} from a quantum computer.

Researchers around the world are racing to build quantum computers that
would operate in radically different ways from ordinary computers and
could break the current encryption that provides security and privacy
for just about everything we do online. The algorithms announced today
are specified in the first completed standards from NIST's post-quantum
cryptography (PQC) standardization project, and are ready for immediate
use.

The three new standards are built for the future. [Quantum computing
technology is developing]{.underline} rapidly, and some [experts
predict]{.underline} that [a device with]{.underline} the [capability to
**break current encryption**]{.underline} [methods]{.underline} could
appear within a decade, [threatening]{.underline} the
[security]{.underline} and privacy [of]{.underline} individuals,
organizations and entire **[nations]{.underline}**.

"The advancement of quantum computing plays an essential role in
reaffirming America's status as a global technological powerhouse and
driving the future of our economic security," said Deputy Secretary of
Commerce Don Graves. "Commerce bureaus are doing their part to ensure
U.S. competitiveness in quantum, including the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, which is at the forefront of this
whole-of-government effort. [NIST is]{.underline}
[providing]{.underline} invaluable [expertise to develop **innovative
solutions** to]{.underline} our [quantum challenges]{.underline},
[including security]{.underline} [measures like]{.underline}
**[post-quantum cryptography]{.underline}** [that
organizations]{.underline} can [start]{.underline} to [implement to
secure our post-quantum future]{.underline}. As this decade-long
endeavor continues, we look forward to continuing Commerce's legacy of
leadership in this vital space."

The standards --- containing the encryption algorithms' computer code,
instructions for how to implement them, and their intended uses --- are
the result of an eight-year effort managed by NIST, which has a long
history of developing encryption. [The agency]{.underline} has [rallied
the world's cryptography]{.underline} [experts to conceive, submit and
then evaluate cryptographic algorithms]{.underline} [that could
**resist**]{.underline} the [assault of quantum computers]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} [nascent technology]{.underline} [could
**revolutionize fields**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [weather
forecasting]{.underline} [to]{.underline} fundamental physics [to **drug
design**]{.underline}, but it carries threats as well.

"[Quantum computing]{.underline} technology [could become a force for
solving]{.underline} many of [society's **most intractable
problems**]{.underline}, and the [new standards]{.underline}
[represent]{.underline} NIST's [commitment to ensuring]{.underline} [it
will not]{.underline} simultaneously [**disrupt our
security**,"]{.underline} said Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards
and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio. "These finalized
standards are the capstone of NIST's efforts to safeguard our
confidential electronic information."

Encryption carries a heavy load in modern digitized society. It protects
countless electronic secrets, such as the contents of email messages,
medical records and photo libraries, as well as information vital to
national security. Encrypted data can be sent across public computer
networks because it is unreadable to all but its sender and intended
recipient.

Encryption tools rely on complex math problems that conventional
computers find difficult or impossible to solve. A sufficiently capable
quantum computer, though, would be able to sift through a vast number of
potential solutions to these problems very quickly, thereby defeating
current encryption. The algorithms NIST has standardized are based on
different math problems that would stymie both conventional and quantum
computers.

"These [finalized standards include]{.underline} [instructions for
incorporating]{.underline} them [into products and encryption
systems]{.underline}," said NIST mathematician Dustin Moody, who heads
the PQC standardization project. "We encourage system administrators to
start integrating them into their systems immediately, because full
integration will take time."

Moody said that these standards are the primary tools for general
encryption and protecting digital signatures.

NIST also continues to evaluate two other sets of algorithms that could
one day serve as backup standards.

One of these sets consists of three algorithms designed for general
encryption but based on a different type of math problem than the
general-purpose algorithm in the finalized standards. NIST plans to
announce its selection of one or two of these algorithms by the end of
2024.

The second set includes a larger group of algorithms designed for
digital signatures. In order to accommodate any ideas that
cryptographers may have had since the initial 2016 call for submissions,
NIST asked the public for additional algorithms in 2022 and has begun a
process of evaluating them. In the near future, NIST expects to announce
about 15 algorithms from this group that will proceed to the next round
of testing, evaluation and analysis.

While analysis of these two additional sets of algorithms will continue,
Moody said that any subsequent PQC standards will function as backups to
the three that NIST announced today.

"[There is no need to **wait** for future standards]{.underline}," he
said. "[Go ahead and start]{.underline} [using **these
three**]{.underline}. [We need to be]{.underline} [**prepared** in case
of]{.underline} an [attack]{.underline} that defeats the algorithms in
these three standards, [and]{.underline} [we will continue working on
**backup plans**]{.underline} to keep our data safe. But for most
applications, [these **new standards** are the **main
event**]{.underline}."

[performance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} quantum [sensors]{.mark}. In power
system environments, various **noise** sources such as **thermal
fluctuations** and **electromagnetic interference** can lead to quantum
decoherence.]{.underline} However, a deep understanding of quantum
decoherence also provides opportunities for developing new quantum
sensing strategies. For example, through carefully designed quantum
error correction codes and dynamic decoupling techniques, quantum
coherence time can be significantly extended, improving the stability
and reliability of quantum sensors. Furthermore, some quantum systems
exhibit exceptional robustness to specific types of environmental noise,
providing new ideas for designing interference-resistant quantum
sensors. In power system measurements, understanding and controlling
quantum decoherence processes is crucial for achieving high-precision
and high-stability quantum sensing. For example, when designing quantum
magnetometers for current measurements, consideration must be given to
minimizing the impact of external magnetic field fluctuations on quantum
states. [At the same time, the quantum decoherence process itself can be
used as a sensitive means of environmental detection, which may find
applications in power system environmental monitoring.
**[Overcoming]{.mark}** the [challenges]{.mark} of quantum decoherence

[Although [quantum sensing]{.mark} technology has shown enormous
potential in laboratory environments, it still [faces challenges]{.mark}
in technological maturity and engineering aspects for practical
applications in power systems. Most quantum sensors currently require
strict environmental control, such as [**extremely low temperatures** or
**high vacuum conditions**, which]{.mark} significantly [differ
from]{.mark} the complex [on-site environments]{.mark} of power systems.
For example, magnetometers based on Superconducting Quantum Interference
Devices (SQUIDs), while highly sensitive, typically [require **liquid
helium** cooling]{.mark}, which is difficult to implement in actual
power systems.]{.underline} The stability [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
reliability of quantum sensors need further improvement. Power systems
require measurement equipment to work stably over long periods, and the
long-term stability of many current quantum sensors cannot meet this
requirement. Additionally, the calibration of quantum sensors is a
significant challenge. Traditional calibration methods may no longer be
applicable, necessitating the development of new quantum metrology
standards (Bao et al., 2020). [In terms of engineering, how to achieve
[**miniaturization**, **cost reduction**, and **mass
production**]{.mark} of quantum sensors [are urgent issues to be
resolved]{.mark}.]{.underline} These challenges require
interdisciplinary collaboration, combining knowledge from quantum
physics, materials science, electronic engineering, and other fields to
gradually overcome.

[A well-protected and characterised source in a [quantum]{.mark} key
distribution system [is]{.mark} needed for its security. Unfortunately,
the source is [**vulnerable to light-injection attacks**, such as
**Trojan-horse**, **laser-seeding**, and **laser-damage
attacks**]{.mark}, in [which a]{.mark}n eavesdropper actively **injects
bright light to hack the source unit**. The hacking [laser could be a
high-power one]{.mark} that [can **modify properties of
components**]{.mark} via the laser-damage attack [and]{.mark} also
[further help the Trojan-horse and other light-injection
attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline} Here we propose a countermeasure against
the light-injection attacks, consisting of an additional sacrificial
component placed at the exit of the source. This component should either
withstand high-power incoming light while attenuating it to a safe level
that cannot modify the rest of the source, or get destroyed into a
permanent high-attenuation state that breaks up the line. We demonstrate

[On the flip side, [state]{.mark}-sponsored [quantum hacking is a
**growing geopolitical issue**]{.mark}. Nations are investing heavily in
quantum tech for both offense and defense. The United States and China,
for example, accuse each other of stockpiling encrypted intercepts now
to decrypt later when quantum computers arrive​​. While that's about using
quantum to hack classical encryption (a separate threat vector), [there
is]{.mark} also [likely]{.mark} covert [research into hacking quantum
systems]{.mark} themselves.]{.underline} Government labs have "quantum
hacking" programs -- for instance, the Russian Quantum Center in Moscow
hosts a Quantum Hacking Lab led by Makarov​. These groups look for
weaknesses in rival quantum crypto implementations, and we can expect
intelligence agencies worldwide to do the same. A national security
concern is that if one country deploys a quantum communication network
(believing it secure), adversaries might secretly already know how to
break it via side-channels. The Reuters investigation noted that China
portrays its quantum communication network as theoretically unhackable​,
with the famous satellite experiments enabling secure video calls. [But
if another nation has developed better quantum hacking techniques (or if
the equipment has **hidden flaws**), that confidence could be misplaced.
This cat-and-mouse resembles the traditional cyber espionage race, now
in the quantum domain.]{.underline}

[Finally, consider future quantum tech like [quantum sensors]{.mark},
quantum IoT devices, etc. A quantum sensor (say for GPS or timekeeping)
[could be tricked by **feeding it fabricated quantum signals**]{.mark}
if not authenticated. Quantum random number generators [could be
**subtly biased** by environmental manipulation]{.mark} (as shown with
light injection​). Even quantum algorithms themselves might **need
verification** -- [a malicious provider could give]{.mark} you a
**[quantum-simulated output that is incorrect]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As
quantum computing integrates with AI and big data (quantum AI), the
attack surface widens: [one could imagine **[tampering with the training
data]{.mark}** of a quantum machine learning model to [produce **wrong
predictions**]{.mark}, which is a kind of **indirect attack** on a
quantum system's utility.]{.underline}

[[Quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} cryptography, meanwhile, [[is

[[Cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark} as we know it today [[is a product of

problems quantum cryptanalysis creates for communications security. On
the other it will still depend on a complex sociotechnical
implementation involving lazy, gullible, selfish human beings. Large
scale quantum networks will undoubtedly complicate intelligence analysis
and require new kinds of technical expertise at signals intelligence
agencies, but [[it is **unlikely**]{.mark} that [they will **lock out**
collectors from target network]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}. Indeed,
if quantum computers marginally improve public trust in information
networks and thus the data on them, those networks will simply become
more attractive intelligence targets. New levels of trust will create
new opportunities for abusing trust. [The **golden age** of [cyber

Methodology

The [**[researchers built]{.mark}** a sophisticated optical [system
using specialized equipment]{.mark} including **fiber optic cables**,
**laser sources**, and **ultra-sensitive photon
detectors**]{.underline}. The setup had three main stations (Alice, Bob,
and Charlie) connected by fiber optic cable. They used a technique
called wavelength division multiplexing to separate quantum and
classical signals, similar to how different radio stations can broadcast
on different frequencies without interfering with each other. The
quantum signals were generated using special crystals that create pairs
of entangled photons, while the classical signals were generated using
standard telecommunications equipment.

Results

The [team [successfully demonstrated]{.mark} quantum **[teleportation
over]{.mark} a [30]{.mark}.2[km fiber]{.mark}** while simultaneously
transmitting 400Gbps classical data]{.underline}. They achieved quantum
state fidelity (a measure of how well the quantum information was
preserved) of around 90%, well above the classical limit of 67%. The
system worked even with classical signals 150 times stronger than needed
for normal operations, suggesting significant headroom for practical
applications.

Limitations

[The [system]{.mark} still [requires **extremely sensitive** and

[that **must be cooled to**]{.mark} **very [low

### Quantum Impossible\-\--2NC

#### Their evidence [confuses]{.underline} [possibility]{.underline} with [probability]{.underline}

**Zeitgeist '24** (Quantum News, "Challenges And Limitations Of Quantum
Teleportation", Quantum Teleportation Explained, DOA: 7/5/2025, KAoki)

[[Quantum]{.mark} Teleportation]{.underline} is not a means of
transporting macroscopic objects, but rather a process that relies on
the principles of quantum mechanics to transfer information about the
quantum state of a particle from one location to another. This process
[**[requires]{.mark} a [shared entangled resource]{.mark}** between the
sender and receiver]{.underline}, which is used to encode and decode the
quantum information (Bennett et al., 1993; Bouwmeester et al., 1997).
[However, [the]{.mark} **creation** and [**maintenance** of this
entanglement are **challenging tasks**]{.mark}, especially [**over long
distances**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One of the [**[main limitations]{.mark}** of Quantum]{.underline}
Teleportation [[is the need for]{.mark} a **[reliable means of
distributing entangled particles]{.mark}** between the sender and
receiver]{.underline}. This can be [achieved through **[optic]{.mark}al
[fiber]{.mark}s**]{.underline} or free-space quantum communication
**[[channels]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ursin et al., 2004; Yin et al.,
2017). [Yet, these methods [are **prone to errors** caused by]{.mark}
photon **[loss]{.mark}**, [**noise**, and]{.mark} other
**[environment]{.mark}al factors**, which can **[compromise]{.mark} the
[fidelity]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the teleported
[state]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Another challenge]{.underline} facing Quantum Teleportation [is **the
requirement for precise control** over the quantum states involved in
the process]{.underline}. This [involves]{.underline} the accurate
preparation of the entangled resource. It also requires precise
manipulation of the quantum states during the encoding and decoding
stages (Nielsen & Chuang, 2000). [[Any **errors or
imperfections**]{.mark} **in these processes can [lead to a
degradation]{.mark}** []{.mark}of the teleported state.]{.underline}

Furthermore, Quantum Teleportation is not a means of transmitting
information faster than light. The process relies on classical
communication between the sender and receiver to coordinate the encoding
and decoding stages (Bennett et al., 1993). This means that
[[**the**]{.mark} overall [**speed** of]{.mark} the teleportation
**[process is limited by]{.mark} the speed of [classical
communication]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Additionally, Quantum Teleportation is not a secure means of
communication in itself. While the process can be used as part of a
larger quantum cryptographic protocol to provide secure communication
(Ekert et al., 1991), [it does not inherently guarantee security against
eavesdropping or other forms of interference.]{.underline}

[**[The scalability]{.mark} of Quantum** Teleportation **[is
also]{.mark} an [open question]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
**[As]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [number of particles]{.mark}
involved in the process [increases]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[so]{.underline}]{.mark}** too **[[do]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the
**[challenges]{.mark}** associated with **[maintaining]{.mark} control
over their [quantum states]{.mark}** and distributing entangled
resources]{.underline} (Bouwmeester et al., 1997). This **[[makes it
difficult to envision]{.mark} a [practical
implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}** of Quantum Teleportation **[[for
large-scale communication]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### It\'s [scientifically]{.underline} impossible.

Similarly, [**[quantum communication]{.mark}s** networks]{.underline}
that must retain entanglement across long distances and not propagate
error during teleportation also [[require temperatures close to
**absolute zero**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The real paradigm shift,
however, involves [[**deploying** these **technologies**]{.mark} across
numerous sectors]{.underline}---such as finance, energy, military, and
healthcare---and they [[will need to]{.mark}, at a minimum,
[**overcome** the temperature constraint]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
scientists try to probe deeper into understanding fundamental quantum
properties like increasing coherence time (T₂) and reducing decoherence
rates, they are also trying to create long-term stable qubits at ambient
room temperature (293K or 20°c), the holy grail for engineers and
scientists alike. This feat is not
trivial.[^\[11\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn11) As
of October 2024, a team of American researchers using a sophisticated
vanadyl porphyrin, holds the world record for longest T₂ of a fully
saturated array of molecular qubit at room temperature with a modest
time of 31
ns.[^\[12\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn12) For
comparison, the longest T₂ for an operating qubit at ultra-cold
temperature is 10 minutes and this record is held by a Chinese research
group.[^\[13\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn13) [[If]{.mark}
in theory, [qubits could operate at **room temperature**]{.mark}, [this
process would]{.mark} likely [require **very high pressure**]{.mark},
which presents its own logistical challenges]{.underline}. **[[Quantum
sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., ytterbium complexes) face a
different
challenge.[^\[14\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn14) These
systems [[must retain short **decoherence times** and remain stable
in]{.mark} complex environments, such as [**liquid** or **high thermal**
fluctuation, in order to be useful]{.mark} as a detection
tool]{.underline} (i.e., giving a readout with a low signal-to-noise
ratio) for chemical analytes or even dark matter.

[[Overcoming the **ultra-cold temperature**]{.mark} limitation [and
achieving **chemical stability**]{.mark}, alone, [will take]{.mark}
several years, if not **[decades]{.mark}**, [for **researchers** across
the **globe**]{.mark} to accomplish]{.underline}. According to a recent
RAND report, the United States is in the lead for developing quantum
sensors, but lags behind China in quantum computers and quantum
communications.[^\[15\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn15),[^\[16\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn16) However,
another report claims that the US is ahead of China in quantum
computing, but lags behind in
sensors.[^\[17\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn17) [[Despite]{.mark}
the [**conflicting** findings]{.mark}, both state that [each
**subdomain**]{.mark}, regardless of country, [remains **several years**
away from]{.mark} possible **[commercialisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Only new materials and new chemicals with their unique physical
properties will open technological frontiers as current engineering
manipulation are constrained by the issues discussed above. Stateof-
the-art QIST materials that are being explored include: quantum dots,
superconductors, nitrogen-vacancy centres, and molecules (e.g.,
molecular frameworks, 2D arrays, organicbased donor-acceptor
radicals).[^\[18\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/navigating-the-entanglements-in-the-u-s-china-quantum-technology-race#_edn18) These
diverse classes of compounds are typically composed of transition
metals, lanthanide (rare-earth elements), actinides, or mixed-metal
systems that will require sourcing from different countries, yet there
is an unbalanced dependency on China for these materials for all
aspiring leaders in QIST.

The UK government has **[withdrawn support]{.underline}** for the £25
billion Morocco-UK Power Project [[due to **national interest**]{.mark}
**concerns.**]{.underline}

This project aimed to transmit renewable energy from Morocco to the UK
via a 3,800 km subsea power cable.

The [lack of **government-backed contracts** reduced investment
attractiveness]{.underline}, leading to project termination.

The ambitious project, led by British clean energy company, Xlinks,
involved laying over 3,800 kilometers of high-voltage subsea cables from
Morocco\'s Guelmim-Oued Noun region to Devon in southwest England, to
generate enough electricity to power over 7 million UK homes, accounting
for up to 8% of the country\'s energy needs.

Prior to its termination, the inter-continental energy project, which
would have harnessed over 10.5 gigawatts of solar and wind power to
deliver a steady 3.6 gigawatts of baseload energy, had reportedly
cleared environmental permits and was scheduled for construction as
early as 2027.

Reuters report that over £100 million (\$137 million) has already been
spent on development and feasibility studies, with significant interest
from lenders to fund the construction phase.

Depending on the nature of the seafloor, [**[sediment
reworking]{.mark}** by installation, maintenance]{.underline} or
**[decommissioning]{.underline}** can [[lead to **turbid
plumes**]{.underline}]{.mark} that can reach several tens of hectares,
with suspended [particulate **matter concentrations**]{.underline} that
can reach several dozen mg l-1 \[31\]. Apart from sediment type, the
extent and properties of plumes will depend on factors such as
installation technique, [**[hydrodynamic conditions]{.mark}** and the
scale of cable-laying]{.underline}. For instance, in the Nysted offshore
wind farm (Denmark) where the substrate is dominated by medium sand
sediment, cable installation in water depths between 6 and 9.5 m,
generated mean particle concentrations of 14 mg l-1 (up to 75 mg l-1) at
200 m from the operation site during trenching with a backhoe dredger,
and 2 mg l-1 (up to 18 mg l-1) during jetting (Seacon, 2005 in \[20\]).
Turbid[ity can persist for several days depending on the duration of the
whole cable-laying proces]{.underline}s. At the Nysted offshore wind
farm, one month was necessary to excavate 17,000 m3 of sediment for a
10.3-km long, 1.3-m wide and 1.3-m deep cable trench \[32\]. However, at
any given location on a cable route, disturbance will typically persist
from a few hours to a few days.

[[**Decrease** in **water transparency**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[deposition of the **resuspended material**]{.underline} may [[**limit
light** for primary producers and **impact feeding ability**]{.mark} of
fish that **detect** **their prey** visually]{.underline} \[33\]. The
[efficiency of invertebrate filter-feeding]{.underline} could also
[be]{.underline} temporarily **[modified]{.underline}** \[34,35\].
Resuspension/deposition processes through the plume may bury the eggs of
bottom laying species. The [presence of **[mineral particles]{.mark}**
in the water column may also [lead to **gill damage**]{.mark}
in]{.underline} young [fish]{.underline} larvae \[36,37\]. For example,
early survival of cod recruits (whose eggs are pelagic) may be affected
by the sediment plume created by cable trenching \[38\].

Nevertheless, **[tu[r]{.mark}bidity increases]{.underline}** resulting
[from **cable installation**]{.underline} and decommissioning constitute
localised and **[short-term effects]{.underline}**. Although no study
has focused on the impact of particle resuspension induced by [cable
installation and **decommissioning** on **marine
communities**]{.underline}, it should generally have negligible impacts
on marine ecosystems.

The main **[[chemical risk]{.underline}]{.mark}** is the potential
[[release of **sediment-buried pollutants**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.,
[heavy metals and hydrocarbons]{.underline}) during sediment
resuspension [[caused by **cable burial**]{.mark}, decommissioning or
repair works.]{.underline} The highest **[contaminant
concentrations]{.underline}** are generally [located in **coastal
areas**]{.underline} due to human activities. A preliminary analysis to
assess the level of sediment toxicity should be performed in potentially
polluted areas to select a cable route which avoids the remobilisation
and **[dispersion of pollutants]{.underline}** \[39\].

**[Pollution]{.underline}** can also [occur during the **operation
phase**]{.underline}, especially for monopolar DC cables using sea
[**electrodes** for the return current path]{.underline} (which
represent around 30% of HVDC in service use \[40\]). Indeed, the
[**cathode** and]{.underline} the **[anode]{.underline}** of sea
electrodes [[**release toxic electrolysis** products]{.mark} like
**chlorine** and **bromine**]{.underline} which can [impact]{.underline}
the immediate **[water quality]{.underline}** \[10,40\]. To a lesser
extent, some older cables have hydrocarbon fluid insulation and may
[[**leak contaminants** into the **marine environment**]{.mark} when
damaged.]{.underline} The amount of fluid released will vary according
to the time needed to detect and repair the leakage, its location and
the extent of the damage, but in worst cases several tens of litres can
be released per hour (Schreiber et al. 2004, in \[41\]). It should be
noted that installation of oil-insulated cables ceased in the 1990s
\[42\]. Furthermore, [ships and **hydraulic equipmen**t]{.underline}
pose a [**higher potential risk** of accidental oil leakage]{.underline}
during operations \[23,43\]. [[**Cables** also include]{.mark}
**copper**, **lead** and other [heavy metals that are potential sources
of **contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, a cable
consisting of a 3.5-mm lead sheath contains 12 kg lead m-1 (Schreiber et
al., 2004 in \[41\]). **[Heavy metals]{.underline}** can potentially
[**dissolve** and **spread** into the **sediment**]{.underline} from
damaged and abandoned cables, but the quantities released are considered
insufficient to have significant impacts. Furthermore, such pollution is
rare as cables are usually removed when no longer in operation. Although
no studies focus specifically on SPC-related contaminants, this source
of disturbance is considered to be rare, spatially localised and
unlikely to have significant impacts on benthic communities.

Besides shaping the digital environment, [[submarine

There are [**four reasons** why [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} Ocean
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} distinct from other oceans and [[**critical**
to]{.mark} our **[planet's survival]{.mark}**:]{.underline}

[First]{.underline}, while this relatively small (by ocean standards)
[**[marine environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} holds only [1% of the
world's ocean volume and occupies]{.underline} only 3% [of the world's
ocean surface area]{.underline}, its [[impact]{.mark} on the **[global
climate system]{.mark}** is **disproportionately large**.]{.underline}

[Second]{.underline}, though small in area, [it scoops up]{.underline}
over [10% of global river runoff]{.underline} and [claims twenty
of]{.underline} the world's [100 longest rivers.]{.underline}

[Third]{.underline}, the **[Arctic marine domain]{.underline}**
comprises about a [[third of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[world's
coastline]{.underline}]{.mark}.

And [fourth]{.underline}, the [Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [contains
[one-quarter of]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[world's continental
shelf]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of [immense **socio-ecological
importance.**]{.underline}

On all counts, the little Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage.

Despite its importance, the Arctic Ocean sometimes goes missing from
public ocean-talk as more 'local' [[**marine issues** take centre
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}. A [key point]{.underline} for non-experts is
to recognize that the [Arctic]{.underline} Ocean is different from other
oceans and it is the [[critical driver of the **global oceanic conveyor
belt**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, the [Gulf Stream and North
Atlantic Current are **strongly regulated**]{.underline} by processes
that occur in the Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is remote to many of us, but
its [influence]{.underline} can be [**felt everywhere**.]{.underline}

How do we know this? Oceanographers have **[robust scientific
evidence]{.underline}** on the [role]{.underline} the [[Arctic]{.mark}
plays within our planet.]{.underline} For instance, the global
hydrological cycle determines the distribution of water around the
planet -- and [[affects **food** and **water security**]{.mark}
**globally**]{.underline}. This cycle begins in warmer climates, with
the equatorial trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies. It is refined
and shaped by the global distribution of land masses that, in the
northern hemisphere, collect precipitation and direct it poleward
through massive rivers. These [rivers introduce **substantial amounts**
of fresh water]{.underline} into the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean,
providing the required conditions for an ice cover to form, and
regulating nutrient supplies and biological productivity.

But these [dynamics are **undergoing unprecedented**]{.underline} and
worrying [changes]{.underline} that are already [visible]{.underline}.
Jonathan Smith, producer of Blue Planet II, reflected on the new
realities of filming in the Arctic Ocean: "We were all set and ready to
film but we needed two major things -- walrus and ice. I had expected
that walrus may be hard to find, but I did not expect it to be hard to
find ice in the Arctic.... the crew were all commenting how surprisingly
warm it was." They were not mistaken. Over many years, scientists have
been recording changes in global temperature, hydrological cycles and
sea-ice cover. These changes have all had significant and eminently
observable effects on the Arctic Ocean. Over the past two decades alone,
summer sea-ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean has decreased by about seven
million square kilometres to just over 3 million square kilometres. This
loss represents a surface area larger than all but about a dozen
countries in the world.

However, the Arctic Ocean is not just a passive victim of anthropogenic
change: it also drives disruptions back to the global system in ways
that were overlooked even a decade ago. Though the exact mechanisms are
still debated, [Arctic sea-ice loss may be **affecting** both ocean
currents and **[mid-latitude weather patterns]{.mark}** along our
southern borders]{.underline}. And the processes occurring in the Arctic
play a vital role in connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic. The fabled
Northwest Passage is more than a destination for explorers and
commercial ship traffic; the [Arctic]{.underline} is an oceanographic
[**freight train** that **ties together** and **influences** other
maritime regions and the **global climate system**.]{.underline}

Worryingly there are [[big changes in Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
sea-ice cover, **[freshwater supply]{.underline}**, [nutrient
availability]{.underline} and the **[underwater light
climate]{.underline}** which are taking place at an accelerated pace,
with associated shifts in [**seawater chemistry** and **biological
activity**,]{.underline} and alterations to **[habitat]{.underline}**
and [food-web structure]{.underline} that are [[affecting the **entire
ocean**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ocean waters are growing more acidic, and
[oxygen concentrations]{.underline} have decreased by nearly 8% over the
past 50 years alone. From this perspective, it seems inevitable that the
ongoing and rapid changes in the physical environment of the marine
[Arctic will [push existing **socio-ecological
systems**]{.mark}]{.underline} - small and large - [**[beyond tipping
points]{.mark}** and into new regimes]{.underline}.

The [challenge]{.underline} of all this has [not been purely
logistical]{.underline}. As the permafrost thaws, the structural base
for roads, buildings and other [key [**infrastructure** has
**collapsed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
[[trying to **deploy**]{.underline}]{.mark} [huge amounts
of]{.underline} infrastructure and [**[military capacity]{.mark}** to
build structures]{.underline} on land that [is
disintegrating]{.underline}, across roads that are disappearing. In
December 2022, it passed a new law requiring 90-day notification for any
warship transiting the northern sea route. It has also legislated that
there be no more than one warship allowed in these waters at any one
time and that any submarine be required to surface and show its flag
along the internal waters of the route.

Recent experience in the Pacific suggests that the
[[US]{.underline}]{.mark} or Nato will seek to **[[assert
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** of navigation under the UN convention on
the law of the sea. This [[is]{.mark} inherently
**[risky]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Russia could see]{.underline}]{.mark}
such [[attempts]{.mark} to declare freedom]{.underline} of navigation
[[as]{.mark} a **[provocation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But failure to
enforce these freedoms carries an opposite risk: without maintaining a
presence in the region, Nato members would be allowing Russia's new
law** **to become normalised. A [**[careful balancing]{.mark}** act [is
**essential**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to maintain]{.mark}
[presence]{.mark}]{.underline} and not allow Russia to close off this
region of the Arctic as its private domain.

[[**Moscow sees** **Nato**]{.mark} borders expanding]{.underline}. It
**[[fears encirclement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its experience of
[[humiliation in **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[**[increased]{.mark}** this **[tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Two
[Arctic brigades]{.underline} have been [deployed]{.underline} to
Ukraine [with disastrous consequences]{.underline}; the Norwegian
Institute for Defence Studies estimates that more than 1,000
personnel have been lost. As Russia's conventional land forces have been
depleted in the Arctic, the [[Kremlin will turn to]{.underline}]{.mark}
its naval and **[[submarine capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
[**[potential to inflict]{.mark}** **[damage to undersea
cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} and pipelines [[is a
**lever**]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[Putin could
use]{.underline}]{.mark}** against his opponents.

At the moment, it seems our politicians are not looking beyond the
Ukraine war. They need to. A weakened and [**[resentful
Russia]{.underline}** [does **not** make]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[a
**stable**]{.mark} global [order]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have already
seen Putin pivot to China and use the Arctic as a bargaining chip to
strengthen that relationship. It is scarcely a month since the two
countries' coastguards signed a memorandum in Murmansk about cooperation
in the Arctic. China's price for providing Russia with support over
Ukraine could be requesting naval access to Russian bases in the Arctic.

On a recent visit to the Ny-Ålesund international research station on
Svalbard, it was depressing to hear that scientific cooperation with
Russia on climate matters has effectively ceased. The [[Arctic]{.mark}
is an environment where]{.underline} [[**cooperation** is
**essential**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Arctic [science must be]{.underline}
done over the [long term]{.underline}, and the
**[[relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}** and trust built up between
partners **[[offer]{.underline}]{.mark}** predictability and [[greater

over-securitised, [**every opportunity** to]{.underline} minimise
accidental misunderstandings and [**[avoid]{.mark}** a [**military**

A [[militarised Arctic]{.mark} would [undermine]{.mark}]{.underline}
scientific [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[pose]{.mark} an
**[existential threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Somehow, [[we
need]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**diplomatic effort** to]{.mark}
separate]{.underline} the [politics of war from]{.underline} the
imperatives of **[[climate research]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the

https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/07/03/impact-of-quantum-technologies-on-nuclear-deterrence/
// shaka

[[Nuclear deterrence has]{.mark} historically [relied on]{.mark} the
principle of **[mutual vulnerability]{.mark}**. However, [advances in
quantum]{.mark} computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing
[could]{.mark} likely [alter this]{.mark} equation. These
[tech]{.mark}nologies [can **disrupt established communication**
security patterns, **missile defense**, and]{.mark} early warning
systems (**[EWS]{.mark}**).]{.underline} On the contrary, this
technology can play a proactive role in enhancing communication and
defense mechanisms of states that possess and utilize nuclear
technology.

Quantum technologies, in particular quantum computing, present
significant threats to traditional nuclear deterrence mechanisms by
undermining the encryption methods used in nuclear command, control, and
communication systems (NC3), which can result in serious vulnerabilities
concerning nuclear safety and security. The cryptographic methods used
in quantum computing rely solely on mathematical problems that are
impossible to solve by classical computers. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
and Diffie-Hellman, key cryptographic algorithms, are widely used for
secure digital communications both for civilian and military purposes.
[If these systems become vulnerable to cyberattacks, the established
nuclear deterrence **could be endangered**, leading to a **potential
risk of miscalculation and escalation** among nuclear-armed
states.]{.underline} If developed to the highest level, quantum
computers could break encryption for these algorithms, which serve as
the foundation for secure communication and data protection. With these
technological advancements, it is imperative to understand the
application of quantum sensing.

[By increasing the ability to select and acquire targets, a quantum
sensor could **significantly increase** an adversary's ability to
**detect and track submarines,** stealth aircraft, and even ballistic
missile launches. For instance, quantum-powered radars are capable of
detecting even the tiniest signals of enemy activity and outwitting
current stealth technologies.]{.underline} Therefore, the country that
acquires this capability may gain a strategic advantage over its
perceived adversary, perhaps shifting the balance of power in its favor.
Strategists believe that the acquisition of quantum capabilities will be
a strategic imperative for national security and will serve as a force
multiplier by ensuring secure and encrypted communication mechanisms for
states. [A quantum technology [would also enhance a state's geopolitical
influence and cyber capabilities, as]{.mark} the [victory]{.mark} of
future wars [would be defined by tech]{.mark}nological advancement
rather than the number of soldiers.]{.underline}

While the world is still transitioning into the quantum age in a subdued
manner, most countries have yet to comprehend its far-reaching
consequences. The emergence of quantum technologies may impact the
credibility of nuclear-powered states, which could adversely affect
their command and control systems in crisis situations.

Similarly, quantum key distribution (QKD), which is based on quantum
mechanical principles, provides unbreakable security. The absence of
quantum communications infrastructure could result in an asymmetrical
escalation ladder during times of crisis in which one side is highly
secure with tamper-proof communications while the other is susceptible
to interruption. As a result, this communication security imbalance
could pose a threat to crisis stability. For averting miscalculations
during times of heightened tension, reliable and secure communication
channels are essential. A unilateral quantum-secure communication
advantage would distort strategic signaling and increase the risk of
inadvertent escalation.

[As a matter of fact, [quantum]{.mark} technologies [may **eliminate the
survivability of second-strike capabilities**]{.mark}. The presence of
quantum-enabled missile defense systems would allow countries to easily
detect and **preempt an adversary's deterrent** capabilities, [which
would lead to a **serious strategic setback**]{.mark}. Thus, such a
scenario would result in the abolition of the strategic ambiguity that
sustains nuclear deterrence.]{.underline}

The strategic calculus in nuclear deterrence is changing globally. To
enhance military capabilities and avoid future threats, the
nuclear-powered countries need to develop an appropriate national
quantum strategy, which should include scientific studies and defense
applications. To achieve this, a coordinated effort among academia,
defense institutions, and policymakers is required. In such situations,
states need to cooperate with their strategic partners for enhancing
quantum research to prepare the next generation of physicists,
engineers, and cryptographers to excel in quantum computing. Most
importantly, quantum risk assessments should be incorporated into
nuclear doctrine and command and control structures. The establishment
of quantum-based courses and collaboration with foreign partners should
be encouraged by universities and research institutions.

[In conclusion, quantum technologies present both opportunities and
challenges. [Enhancing the ability of quantum sensors]{.mark} to select
and acquire targets [could significantly improve a state's ability to
**detect and track submarines**]{.mark}, stealth aircraft, [and even
**ballistic missile**]{.mark} launches. This is not just an inventive
perspective but a pressing issue in the age of technological
advancement.]{.underline} Quantum computing can jeopardize secure
communication mechanisms and second-strike capability by its ability to
detect and neutralize the counterstrike forces. In addition, advancement
in quantum technology is a national security issue that requires a
timely response.

perspectives about the technology---[[quantum sensors are **no silver

[The most immediate risk is to encrypted information]{.underline}. A
[CRQC]{.underline} can break common public-key
crypto[systems]{.underline} (like RSA and ECC) [that secure everything
from military communications to online banking. [If Country X alone
possesses a CRQC]{.mark}]{.underline}, it could potentially decrypt the
secret communications of other states at will. [This [would render an
enormous]{.mark}]{.underline} intelligence
[[advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} -- essentially, [[Country X]{.mark}
[could read]{.mark} diplomatic cables[, military orders,]{.mark}
confidential business transactions]{.underline}, etc., [[of any
adversary]{.underline}]{.mark} still using vulnerable encryption. Th[e
[result would be a **one-sided transparency**]{.mark}: the leading state
sees everyone else's secrets, but its own remain secure]{.underline}
(assuming it has transitioned to quantum-proof encryption internally).
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} asymmetry [[is destabilizing. It could
encourage the]{.mark} [leading power to be more
aggressive]{.mark}]{.underline} since it holds an informational high
ground, [[and conversely induce]{.mark} paranoia and
[desperation]{.mark} in others. In a conflict]{.underline}, one side's
[secure networks might go dark]{.underline} as their codes get broken,
potentially [leading to swift victory for the quantum
power]{.underline}. [Even in peacetime]{.underline}, the
[espionage]{.underline} windfall [could shift economic and political
leverage]{.underline} -- imagine deciphering another nation's trade
strategies or uncovering blackmail-worthy info on its leaders.

Moreover, this risk isn't just theoretical for the future; it casts a
shadow on the present. [[The fear of]{.mark} a sudden
"**[Q-Day]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (quantum day) [arriving has already
prompted major powers to stockpile encrypted data]{.underline} (to
decrypt later) [and to rush the deployment of post-quantum cryptography.
There's an erosion of trust]{.underline}: even now, some governments
worry that their communications might eventually be exposed if a rival
is first to CRQC. So, the mere prospect of [[one nation getting there
first introduces suspicion and could lead]{.mark} to]{.underline} a kind
of [[pre-emptive]{.mark} cyber [cold war]{.mark}]{.underline}, where
everyone accelerates cyber defenses and possibly even considers more
drastic measures (like limiting what information is sent electronically
at all).

[**[Strategic Instability]{.mark}** and Arms Race Dynamics]{.underline}

A [[quantum computing]{.underline}]{.mark} breakthrough [[has been
likened to]{.underline}]{.mark} the advent of **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** in terms of disruptive impact. [[If one
country achieves it, others might feel]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategically blackmailed or [[vulnerable]{.underline}]{.mark}, somewhat
[like]{.underline} how [the U.S. nuclear monopoly]{.underline} in
1945-49 [made the Soviet Union feel an **existential
urgency**]{.underline} to get the bomb. [We could see frantic
efforts]{.underline} by others to catch up -- pouring resources into
crash programs or even engaging in risky espionage/sabotage to slow the
leader down. The [[competition could take on an **arms-race
intensity**]{.mark}, straining relations]{.underline} and diverting huge
funds into quantum militarization. Some analysts even speculate about a
quantum deterrence concept: if both sides have CRQCs, maybe they reach a
new balance (akin to mutual assured destruction in nukes, except here
"mutual assured decryption" -- both can read each other's secrets, so
maybe neither trusts the other, a strange equilibrium). But the
transition period where one has it and others don't is perilous. It
might tempt the leader to press its advantage (before others obtain the
tech or switch to quantum-safe encryption, which could take years
globally). [[This could escalate conflicts]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Conversely, [others might take drastic steps to prevent falling too far
behind]{.underline} -- maybe forming coalitions to pool quantum efforts
or, in extreme dystopian scenarios, [[launching **pre-emptive strikes on
facilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} if they believed a rival's CRQC would
completely neutralize their defense. While such military action is
unlikely, it illustrates how [destabilizing]{.underline} a big gap could
be perceived.

While the possibility that [[quantum sensing could affect second-strike
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} is increasingly recognized, discussion
of its full impact on nuclear stability remains at an early stage.57
Current [analysis focuses]{.underline} primarily [on]{.underline} the
[evolving strategic balance]{.underline} between China and the USA,
where both countries are investing in quantum-enabled detection and
counter-detection capabilities. However, the broader literature on how
[emerging]{.underline} and disruptive [tech]{.underline}nologies---such
as [hypersonic]{.underline} weapon[s, cyber]{.underline} operations [and
AI]{.underline}---might interact [with nuclear stability]{.underline} is
far more developed than quantum specific discussions.58

Moreover, outside the relatively balanced China--USA dynamic, there are
regions where **[[quantum asymmetries]{.underline}]{.mark}** are more
pronounced. One example is the relationship between India and
Pakistan.59 India, with its stronger research infrastructure and greater
economic resources, is investing in a range of quantum
initiatives---from quantum computing projects to QKD pilots.60 Pakistan,
with more limited resources, is progressing more slowly. Such
disparities [could [raise]{.mark} regional [security concerns]{.mark}
if]{.underline} India's advantages translate into [superior
surveillance]{.underline}, secure communications [or advanced defence
capabilities.]{.underline}

Early literature suggested that [[quantum
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [could]{.underline} either
[[exacerbate crisis instability]{.mark} by reducing the survivability of
deterrent forces]{.underline} or, conversely, enhance arms control
verification if integrated transparently into monitoring mechanisms.61
Further focused research will be essential to understand these dual
risks and to anticipate how quantum innovations could influence
escalation pathways in future conflict scenarios.

A comprehensive assessment of how [[quantum
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies might [reshape **[strategic
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} and deterrence will require the
development of conceptual frameworks.62 More focused technical analyses
are urgently needed. Current debates frequently rely on speculative
projections, and distinguishing between genuinely emerging capabilities
and premature expectations remains difficult, particularly in military
and security contexts.63 For example, [[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}
technologies [[may have relevance]{.underline}]{.mark} for operations
[[to counter]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction
([[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}), but the maturity and operational viability
of such applications require further scrutiny.64 Without a realistic
appraisal of technical feasibility and operational constraints, there is
a risk of both overstating hypothetical threats or underpreparing for
genuine disruptive shifts. Targeted research focused specifically on
military use cases---such as submarine tracking, secure strategic
communications, battlefield quantum sensing and chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear (CBRN) detection---can help inform responsible
strategic planning and reduce the likelihood of escalation driven by
misperceptions or technological misjudgement.

[Chinese researchers]{.underline} have **[developed]{.underline}** and
tested [a **drone-mounted** quantum sensor]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} could [allow faster and more **accurate detection**
of submarines]{.underline} and underwater features, [according to a
study]{.underline} published April 16 in the Chinese Journal of
Scientific Instrument.

Led by Wang Xuefeng at the Quantum Engineering Research Centre of China
Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the team designed a
system to overcome a major flaw in traditional magnetic anomaly
detectors, as reported by the South China Morning Post. In low-latitude
regions like the South China Sea, Earth's magnetic field runs nearly
parallel to the surface, causing blind zones where conventional sensors
lose effectiveness.

The new [system uses]{.underline} a Coherent Population Trapping
(**[CPT]{.underline}**) [atomic magnetometer]{.underline}, [which
leverages]{.underline} [quantum interference]{.underline} effects [in
rubidium atoms]{.underline}, according to SCMP. [Magnetic fields cause
shifts in]{.underline} the atoms' [energy levels]{.underline},
generating seven distinct microwave resonance signals. By measuring
these resonances, the device can infer the strength and direction of a
magnetic field, without depending on the sensor's physical orientation.

The [researchers connected]{.underline} the [CPT]{.underline}
magnetometer [to a **rotor drone**]{.underline} [using a 20-meter
cable]{.underline} to reduce electromagnetic interference. Additional
instruments, including a fluxgate magnetometer for heading corrections
and GPS-linked ground stations, processed the raw data to remove noise
and account for daily variations in Earth's magnetic field.

Offshore Trials

In offshore trials near Weihai, Shandong province, the system surveyed a
400-meter by 300-meter grid, according to SCMP. Raw measurements showed
a magnetic anomaly detection accuracy of 2.517 nanotesla (nT), which
improved to 0.849 nT after correction. Two independent surveys of the
same area produced results with a 99.8 percent correlation, with a root
mean square error of just 1.149 nT.

The researchers described the outcome as evidence of the system's
real-world stability. In simpler terms, the system could detect
incredibly tiny changes in Earth's magnetic field --- roughly a billion
times smaller than the strength of a typical refrigerator magnet. After
correcting for noise and other small errors, the measurements were
highly consistent across multiple test runs, suggesting that the sensor
could reliably spot even faint magnetic clues left by objects.

In the case of locating **[submarines]{.underline}**, these underwater
vehicles are [made of **metal** and carry]{.underline} **[powerful
engines]{.underline}**, [both]{.underline} of which [slightly disturb
Earth's natural magnetic field]{.underline} as they move underwater. The
quantum sensor looks for these tiny disturbances --- invisible to the
eye but detectable as small magnetic "ripples" --- and maps them out. By
spotting unusual magnetic patterns that don't match the surrounding
environment, the system can reveal the presence of a hidden submarine,
even if it is deep below the surface.

Based on what is known about similar magnetic detection systems, the
drone would likely need to pass within several hundred meters to about a
kilometer of a submarine to reliably detect it, depending on the size of
the vessel, its depth and local magnetic noise.

**[Matches NATO System Performance]{.underline}**

[The CPT-based design matches]{.underline} [the sensitivity of
the]{.underline} sophisticated [MAD-XR system used by NATO]{.underline}
allies [but]{.underline} operates [at]{.underline} significantly [lower
cost and complexity]{.underline}. Unlike MAD-XR, which uses multiple
probes to avoid blind spots, the Chinese sensor achieves full
directional coverage with a single unit. This could make it more
feasible for broad deployment in contested or resource-rich waters at
low latitudes.

The researchers also noted that the sensor's precision could support
civilian applications, including mapping oil fields, locating
shipwrecks, and studying tectonic activity beneath the seafloor.

#### Winning the quantum race gives the U.S. the capability to track and target all of its adversaries' nuclear submarines

This paper looks at how [quantum technology [applications might
affect nuclear]{.mark} weapon
capable submarines (SSBN) **[near-invulnerability]{.mark}**. Could
sophisticated means of surveillance detect and track submarines in an
unprecedented manner and diminish their status as nearly invisible and
thus invulnerable in the open ocean?]{.underline}

For most of us, quantum technology is a spooky matter. "Schroedinger's"
cat, dead and alive at the same time, is merely a native of science
fiction with no resemblance to the kitten purring on our
couch. [Impossible to hack, quantum communication or
quantum computers that could solve problems traditional devices
cannot, [are o]{.mark}nly few of the many
[applications q]{.mark}uantum technology promises.]{.underline} This
fantasy-like futurism increasingly makes up for the fog of the future.
In fact, [the quantum race is already on,1 but we can tell
neither its consequences [nor who]{.mark} will win it.]{.underline}

Although quantum technology has not made it into broad public security
debates,2 it is vital to now have a conversation on its possible impact
on security and defence, especially on nuclear weapons. Such debate is
imperative to designing sound nuclear deterrence doctrines and force
postures, predicting possible risks and shaping risk reduction and arms
control measures.

The race is on

The first quantum revolution resulted from building applications that
followed the rules of quantum mechanics. It brought inventions such as
nuclear energy, transistors, computer chips, digital cameras, lasers or
magnetic resonance, transforming entire societies, not to mention the
conduct of war.

We are currently facing a second quantum revolution based on the ability
to precisely control the rules governing quantum mechanics.
[Manipulating single quantum objects and using quantum phenomena like
entanglement or superposition, quantum mechanics is finding its
way into communication, computing, sensing and
precision ]{.underline}(positioning, navigating, timing).

In addition to applications in the commercial sector,3 [Quantum 2.0 also
promises to become a "gamechanging differentiator"4 in defence and
security.5 For instance, the NATO Science & Technology
Organization called security and military applications
of quantum technologies one of the "**[major strategic
disruptors]{.mark}** over the next 20-years]{.underline}."6 Gary
Aitkenhead, the Chief Executive of the UK's Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory, argued that quantum technology will be "a
gamechanger for defence and society".7 Finally, according to Robert
Ashley, Director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, quantum
technology will "figure prominently in future warfare."8

[Prospective security and military advancements will likely include
[improved **underwater detection**]{.mark} of non-spherical submerged
objects,]{.underline} understanding building structures from the
outside, detection of underground tunnels and bunkers or even fissile
materials9 or improving navigation without GPS, to name but few. At the
same time, experts suspect that quantum communication could disrupt the
process of authenticating codes used to control nuclear weapons,10
quantum computing could "render nuclear secrets un-securable,"11 and
quantum radars could discern through stealth mode.12

So far, I have discussed how the [transoceanic routes]{.underline} [that
connect]{.underline} [submarine cable]{.underline}
[stations]{.underline} and seaports [are deeply related]{.underline} to
each other. [This interconnection]{.underline} is also present in the
development of contemporary trading routes, which are mostly [defined
by]{.underline} the [**movement** of **material

cable was becoming an international norm in telecommunications after
World War II, the containerization of maritime trade was also becoming
the standard of global commerce (Sekula, 1995). The [transatlantic

[Cartographic impositions]{.underline} of the [settler's lexicon]{.underline} onto indigenous lands silences indigenous [presence]{.underline} and replaces [lived experience]{.underline} with [cartographic abstraction]{.underline}.

Cartography as an instrument of power: colonialism and maps

[[The **North**]{.mark} in its entirety [can be considered]{.mark} a
[**colonial** and **militarised**]{.mark} territory]{.underline}, where,
nowadays, decolonial initiatives have arisen. Among these, several are
rooted in mapping. [[**Cartography** has been]{.mark} [**forced** upon
the **land** in]{.mark} such [**violent** ways]{.mark}]{.underline} that
the only way forward is to overthrow the practice itself. Settler
colonialism is not only a political issue; it also consists in
[[**imposing** a way of thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} (considered
superior) [[which **devalues**]{.mark} and replaces [Indigenous
**cultural practices** and **ontologies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Maps
**determine**]{.underline}]{.mark} the locations of the centre and the
fringes, as well as [[the ways]{.mark} in which the [**land** is
**occupied**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As historically strategic tools,
[they [make it **possible** to claim]{.mark} an entire [**territory**
without]{.mark} even **[setting foot]{.mark}** on it]{.underline}. [[The
**Rupert's Land treaties**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the monopolies held
by the major colonial companies, such as the Hudson's Bay Company's hold
over what is now the Canadian North, for instance, [[gave **precedence**
to]{.mark} the [authority of the **word**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- by the
power vested in me, I hereby declare that this land belongs to such and
such -- over physical occupation. As Bernard Nietschmann puts it,
'\[m\]ore indigenous territory has been claimed by maps than by guns'
(1994, 37). Indeed, Europeans took possession of territories before they
set out to explore them. [[Maps are **agents** of]{.mark} this
[**power** and replace the experience of **roaming** the land
with]{.mark} a **[cartographic abstraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
will later serve as proof of property, for instance during subsequent
territorial negotiations

Furthermore, [[maps thwart **toponymy**, replacing it]{.mark} sometimes
[with the **settler's lexicon**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and at other
times, rather cynically, with something [[like '**great white
expanse'**]{.underline}]{.mark}, signalling the unknown (rather than
admitting ignorance) and emptiness (in lieu of acknowledgement). In the
Americas, [[this **imperialist** cartographic violence denies]{.mark}
any [**recognition** of prior **Indigenous
presence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as acknowledging it would negate the
very vocabulary that Europeans used to claim the land: 'the New World',
'New England', 'New France', 'the discovery of America', 'the founding
of Canada'. To allow for the conqueror's gesture, Indigenous toponymy
must be silenced.

This [[cartographic **overwriting** leads to]{.mark} the
**[silencing]{.mark}** not only of place names, but also [of prior
cultures]{.mark} and practices]{.underline}. [[**Maps** render the
land]{.underline}]{.mark} -- an essential and concrete element for
Indigenous cultures -- [[**abstract**, dematerialising it and]{.mark}
devaluing its empirical understanding, [favouring **sedentary life**
over **nomadism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Geographer and linguist
Louis-Edmond Hamelin, who advocated for a 'geography of the feet',
calling for trajectories, experiences, and field observations, writes
that 'such condescending behaviour can only serve to distort the
perception of facts on the ground' (Hamelin, Chartier, and Désy 2013,
41).3 For peoples under colonial rule who still have to live with the
performative efforts of colonial maps within their governance, such as
the Inuit and the Sámi, overthrowing cartographic perspectives is a way
to transform the political order.

Analysing cartography implies above all examining the conventions that
enable the transformation of the land into an abstract entity, as well
as the values that underlie its cultural portrayal. In that sense, it
goes without saying that acts of reversal serve as resistance to settler
colonialism. This defiance can be Indigenous or not; the artwork América
Invertida (1943) by Joaquín Torres García, an avant-garde artist from
Uruguay, has become iconic in South American cultures and is a perfect
example of this attitude, with its caption reading 'Our North Is the
South'. Robin McGrath notes that in several schools of the Canadian
Arctic, the map of Canada is pinned up upside down (1991, 3). These
reversals lie at the heart of the decolonial struggle. However, they
cannot reverse the colonial process that favours abstract understanding
over experience and devalues narrative, the foremost method of knowledge
transmission used in many Indigenous cultures.

Far from being a neutral gesture, [[portraying the **North** as]{.mark}
a [blank]{.mark} space as per the Western tradition [has **social**,
**political**, and **environmental** consequences]{.mark}.
[**Cartography** has located the]{.mark} [**Arctic** on the
**outskirts**]{.mark} of the world's surface [and]{.mark} thereby
[accentuated]{.mark} the **[foreignness]{.mark}** of the
region]{.underline}. Settler colonialism disregards the political and
territorial systems already in place; borders, generally abstract ones,
are traced in order to delineate the land. Two other strategies serve to
overwrite Indigenous understanding of the land in favour of colonial
powers: the omitting and replacing of toponyms. Both negate the history
of the territory and promote the establishment of the colonising power.
[Instating [new **boundaries**]{.mark} and overwriting existing toponymy
goes hand in hand with [devalu]{.mark}ing [**Indigenous** methods of
**orientation** and]{.mark} their [**pre-existing**
cartography]{.mark}]{.underline} and usage of the land. Yet Indigenous
peoples' cartographic practices were useful to the first European
settlers, who leveraged Indigenous knowledge of the land to explore the
American continent. However, as Georges Emery Sioui deplores, European
colonialism dictates a hierarchy of knowledge that places its modes of
thinking, technology, and spatial organisation above those of other
continents (1989). As Irène Hirt writes, \[h\]istory has retained few
traces of past Indigenous maps -- either because they were destroyed or
because they were transient, drawn on sand or on the ashes of a bonfire,
or at best on bark or animal skins. Furthermore, a portion of these
cartographies was immaterial, based on cognitive processes (images,
mental depictions) or performances (rituals, poetic narratives, chants,
dances). (2009, 173)

[[**Colonial** maps allowed states to **shrink** Indigenous]{.mark}
property [to]{.mark} tiny '[**reservations'** bound by **restrictive**
and **compulsory** borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
**[naming]{.mark}** process itself, the act of delineating 'unknown' or
'uninhabited' zones, [and **exploration**]{.mark} followed by
appropriation [are part of a broader **Cartesian resolve** to
control]{.mark} the land [through the **rational**]{.mark}
mind.]{.underline} This gesture underpins the institutional power which
is later carried out by the map: the state, the law, the border (cf.
Said 1993, 225). Restoring a geographical and cultural identity, as well
as reclaiming one's history, thus requires a reflection beyond Western
political frameworks, focusing on the forms and hierarchy of knowledge,
and appropriating the map as an instrument of power. This appropriation
calls for an act of reversal that highlights the force carried out by
the map, followed by a promotion of the toponymy that existed prior to
colonisation, as we will now see in the case of Inuit cartographic
practices in Northern Canada.

#### Vote negative for indigenous [countermapping]{.underline}. Centering [indigenous]{.underline} experience creates [visions]{.underline} of the Arctic where the [colonized]{.underline} exist outside of [dominant]{.underline} structures.

In the following paragraphs, we would like to engage in some detail with
the spatial stories told by Elle-Hánsa's map to introduce some of the
core aims and perspectives advanced in this book. Most of the names that
we see on the map refer to Indigenous lands and peoples. [[By
**inserting** the names of]{.mark} the [peoples that w]{.mark}e now
[know as **Indigenous**, it]{.mark} seemingly **[reverses]{.mark}** the
world we live in, erasing [**colonialism** by removing]{.mark} colonial
**[names]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A second look, however, reveals that
the map does not shy away from the reality of colonisation as it also
refers to settler lands, including, for instance, 'Kanada' and 'Suopma'
(Finland) alongside place names like 'Kalaallit Nunaat' (Greenland),
'Nunavut', and 'Sápmi'. The subtle complexities of Elle-Hánsa's map go
beyond even such second impressions. In fact, while the title of the map
is usually rendered as Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic, this is
strictly speaking not accurate as the Sámi title literally translates to
'North Peoples'. [While [centring **Indigenous peoples**]{.mark}, the
map thereby also [creates a **vision** of the Arctic where]{.mark}
different [peoples **coexist** outside]{.mark} of the hierarchy imposed
by **[colonialism]{.mark}**. [Countering]{.mark} colonial **[naming
practices]{.mark}**, but [without **ignoring** the history]{.mark} of
colonisation, the map [**reclaims** the area]{.mark} now known as the
Arctic [for the **multitude** of people]{.mark} whose homeland it
is]{.underline},3 [[contrasting]{.mark} markedly [with **Southern
views** of the region as '**empty**']{.mark}]{.underline} (see, among
others, Hill 2008). The fact that the names of the many Arctic peoples
are written in North Sámi is thereby significant as they present Arctic
geography through a distinct Sámi lens while simultaneously gesturing
towards circumpolar connections.

[[The **colours**]{.mark} of the map further [articulate this]{.mark}
double [gesture]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its four main colours -- yellow,
red, blue, and green -- are also the colours of the gákti (Sámi garment)
and the Sámi flag, which was adopted around the time of the map's
creation (see Alakorva 2022). The colours reflect what in essence is an
understanding of Sápmi as a land of yellow and red. The yellow sun at
the centre of existence refers to the Sámi (first) story of creation as
Ibmel, the Creator, gave their son, Beaivi (the Sun), the responsibility
to watch over the World as well as the new beings that had been created
to inhabit it. The colour red also comes from the first story as it
points to Vaja, the sacred reindeer doe from which the new world was
created and whose blood made the waterways. Red is also linked to the
goddess Sáráhkká, 4 who (among many other tasks) is the keeper of fire
and the guardian of artistic inspiration. Indeed, [[the
**names**]{.mark} of Arctic peoples on the map [are]{.mark} also
[written in **red**, emphasising both **life**]{.mark} itself
[and]{.mark} the [**interconnectedness** of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} while highlighting the Sámi worldview through
which the polar regions are presented.

Even the visual fashioning of the map embeds Sámi knowledge and values.
Taking on the shape of the Sámi goavddis (drum) with the central sun
surrounded by a multitude of beings,5 it replicates the mapping on the
surface of the drum. With their inscriptions, the Sámi drums of old were
used to map both the secular and spiritual planes of existence,
functioning as a bridge between the different layers of reality in the
Sámi world, including the material world, human and nonhuman life, and
the world of spirits and ancestors (see, among others, Pentikäinen 1987;
Finbog 2023).6 By referring to the goavddis, then, Elle-Hánsa's map
references Sámi geographical practices and spatial philosophy.

At the same time, the three colours that surround the yellow centre --
red, blue, and green -- point beyond Sámi ontologies and evoke the
colours of the Northern Lights (guovssahasat in Sámi7). [[Appearing in
**different** shades and]{.mark} sometimes [**bleeding** into each
other, they suggest]{.mark} Arctic [**diversity** and]{.mark} the
[**relationality** of **circumpolar connections**]{.mark}]{.underline},8
but maybe also the disregard for labels and boxes in Indigenous
cultures. As a locator of cultural value and meanings, the Northern
Lights play an important role in the stories of many Arctic cultures.
Sometimes their meanings overlap; in both Inuit and Sámi cultures, they
are linked to the spirits of the ancestors. For the Inuit, the Northern
Lights are said to be spirits playing kickball with a walrus head in the
sky (see Kappianaq and Nutaraq 2001, 101--20; Bouich 2021, 95--6);
according to both Inuit and Sámi stories, one should not whistle at the
Northern Lights or otherwise call upon their attention as that could
bring down the spirits and anger them (Kappianaq and Nutaraq 2001, 101;
Logan 2009, 47). In more recent decades, the Northern Lights have also
become a prolific symbol used to highlight circumpolar cooperation and
Arctic Indigenous transnationalism.9 Elle-Hánsa's map thus
[[participates in the **creation** of **circumpolar networks** and
**imaginaries** that]{.mark} have [played]{.mark} an [increasingly
important]{.mark} [role in **Indigenous**]{.mark} Arctic [**politics**,
**activism**, and **cultures**]{.mark} since the late
seventies]{.underline}.

The flipside of this discussion revolves around the social and cultural
impacts of digital connectivity and meeting the specific needs of
diverse communities and peoplehoods. That is to say, [[**digital
connectivity** produces challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}! Duarte (2017)
states that, "\[read\] [against the century of US anti-Indian campaigns
and imperial expansion, [narratives **of technological
advancement**]{.mark} function to [**satisfy** societal **desires** for
Enlightenment-era values of progress and **scientific evolution** in
spite of]{.mark} the **[colonial fabric of Indian
eradication]{.mark}**."]{.underline} (p. 11). The paradox lies in the
fact that [[Indigenous peoples can't afford not to engage with and have
increased access to digital connectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wemigwans
mentions, "\[there\] is a general feeling [[that if Indigenous Peoples
do not stake out]{.underline}]{.mark} a claim [on [the Internet, **they
will become colonized in that space too**]{.mark} because of their
absence]{.underline}." (p.29). Indigenous youth are often told by their
Elders, "you need to be there, we need you there." Younger generations
willingly take on the duty of perimeter scoping; carefully observing,
then obtaining knowledge or information from an area that is not well
known and bringing it back to the community for further consideration.
This is a common sentiment across Indian Country. As the President of
the Sovereign Nation of Hawai'i Dennis "Bumpy" Kanahele says, "the

Culture, Compatibility, Commensurability

Yet another unsettling aspect to consider is that [[Western
philosophies]{.mark} are **[not]{.mark}** necessarily [commensurate
to]{.mark}---or even potentially **compatible** with---[Indigenous ways
of knowing and being]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous ontologies and
epistemologies have commonly entailed loose forms of communal property
"ownership" (Younging, 2015) with more fluid and decentralized
configurations of social cohesion and coexistence (Tallbear, 2013;
Coulthard, 2014; Jobin, 2014; Manuel & Posluns, 2019). Pre-contact,
complex legal and customary practices---sometimes referred to as
cultural protocols---had governed Indigenous systems of political
economy and our relationality with and among each other for millennia
(Younging, 2015, p. 1079).31 Many of these [**[traditions and cultural
protocols are at risk of extinction]{.mark};** it's altogether uncertain
whether [digital connectivity]{.mark}---the sociotechnical
architecture(s) underlying colonial modernity---are appropriate modes
and tools for translation, capturing, or transmission]{.underline}.
Younging (2008) heeds us that:

incorporating new ways of doing things, and new uses for \[TK[\],
[should be carefully considered]{.mark} in consultation with community
and Elders]{.underline} and according to Customary Law; [\[\...\]
[if]{.mark} a [new technology]{.mark} or methodology [goes against

impact, or breeches Customary Law, then it should **not be

Bear Nicholas (2008) reinforces the notion [that **[certain
mediums]{.mark}** for communication may be **[inappropriate]{.mark}**
and altogether **insufficient** [if]{.mark} they're [intended to
transmit knowledge]{.mark} or information [of]{.mark} a **[sacred

[Rival empires,]{.underline} historian Andrew Lipmann (2015, p. 88)
argues, "were [first in conflict over where they dropped their
anchors]{.underline}, not where they dragged their ploughs." Yet the
literatures that comprise the field of law and settler colonialism, as
my discussion thus far suggests, have directed their attention almost
exclusively to land alone. What might be gained by analyzing [the sea as
a site of power]{.underline} that shaped and was shaped by colonial,
imperial, and legal struggles in its own right? How might a sharper view
of maritime worlds advance debates on law and settler colonialism,
integrating legal histories of colonialism with settler colonial
studies? [[The **cartographic divisions** **imposed** by Europeans on
the earth and represented in maps of South America, Africa, and
Australia]{.mark},]{.underline} the continental spaces of Marlow\'s
childhood fantasies[, [were also drawn **across the
seas**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} From the sixteenth century
onward, developments in transoceanic shipping and navigation forged the
global conditions that made European imperialism possible in the first
place. Imperial inscriptions on land and sea emerged out of maritime
navigation and the "discovery" of the so-called New World. [[Latitude
and longitude benefitted European empires, imposing a "grid of
intelligibility"]{.mark} onto the globe, while [expanding their
legal]{.mark} and [political claims over sovereignty and
jurisdiction]{.mark} (]{.underline}Benton 2010; Dorsett 2007, p. 144;
Foucault 1990, p. 93). In these modernist European imaginaries, [[oceans
were **increasingly** represented as "**blank spaces** on the earth,"
**emptied** of people, law, and politics]{.underline}]{.mark} (Conrad
1988, p. 11; Steinberg 2001, p. 38).

One of the most famous conflicts in the history of European imperial
expansion occurred between the Portuguese and the Dutch, not on land but
at sea. In the early seventeenth century, Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius
\[2004 (1609)\] was commissioned by the East India Company to assess the
legality of a maritime capture. A Portuguese carrack, the Santa
Catarina, was seized by a Dutch vessel at the mouth of the Johor River,
in a region that Portugal claimed to be within its sovereign control
(Borschberg 2010; Keene 2002, pp. 50--52). In 1609, Grotius\'s response
was published anonymously as Mare Liberum, or "free sea" (Armitage
2004). Here, he argued that the Dutch capture was entirely legal because
the sea could not be held by one imperial power. Under the law of nature
and the law of nations the sea was held in common to all. In a poetic
reflection on the materiality of oceans, Grotius \[2004 (1609)\] drew a
clear demarcation between land and sea. [The physical properties of
oceans---including their **ephemerality** and **ceaseless**
change---rendered them more physically similar to air than to land.
Whereas land was solid, easily divisible, and thus **subject** to
ownership, Grotius explained, air and sea were diffuse and **could not
be easily possessed:** "\[L\]and through nature can become property,
**while the sea cannot**]{.underline}" \[Grotius 2004 (1609), p. 81\].
However, Grotius did acknowledge that oceans could be sites of
overlapping, conflicting, and competing European imperial claims.
Vessels that flew under particular flags were representatives of the
sovereign powers that backed them (Alexandrowicz 1967, p. 77; Benton
2010, p. 106; Sekula 1995). Though ships "could not mark possession,"
Lauren Benton (2010, p. 136) concludes from her innovative reading of
Mare Liberum, moving vessels "could signal jurisdiction and control, or
the right to protect subjects and their goods."

[[Efforts to divide land and sea by way of **European cartographies**
were part of a much wider global **struggle** for **imperial** and
**legal contro**l of the earth]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite the
distinctions that Grotius and others imposed between "firm land" and
"free sea" (Schmitt 2006), these divisions were not easily maintained in
practice. As several scholars of slavery have noted[, British and [Anglo
authorities]{.mark} [appropriated the **violent** and **coercive**
regimes of maritime worlds and applied them terrestrially in colonial
and settler **colonial** **contexts**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
nineteenth-century United States, [maritime legislation aimed at
controlling ship-jumping sailors was adapted and expanded to govern
fugitive slaves]{.underline} (Gutoff 2006). [The rules of the slave
ship---its violent orders of work and discipline---were extended from
sea to land by way of the plantation]{.underline} (Bolster 1997; Lowe
2015, p. 149; Rediker 2007, 2014; Walvin 2011, p. 43). Though the
maritime transport of slaves may seem an obvious setting in which to
explore the overlapping legal and political boundaries of land and sea[,
[**indigenous dispossession** and]{.mark}
**[deterritorialization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as I discuss below, [[is
another site where the laws of the sea informed the laws of land]{.mark}
and vice versa.]{.underline} 2

[[Indigenous scholars]{.mark} writing of the Pacific and Atlantic [have
problematized and]{.mark} even [rejected the land/sea divide]{.mark} in
important]{.underline} and insightful [ways]{.underline}. In We Are the
Ocean, [Epeli Hau'ofa (2008) argues very compellingly for an
ocean-centric view of the world. [Indigenous peoples in the Pacific
**never** defined their territories in terrestrial terms alone]{.mark},
he explains. [The sea features prominently in **indigenous**
**ontologies** and **cosmologies**,]{.mark} [**recasting conceptions**
of the earth and the multiple worlds that inhabit it as an
**interconnected** and **undifferentiated** whole.]{.mark}]{.underline}
"There is a world of difference between viewing the Pacific as 'islands
in a far sea' and as 'a sea of islands,'" Hau'ofa (2008, p. 152)
maintains. "The first emphasizes dry surfaces in a vast ocean far from
the centers of power. Focusing this way stresses the smallness and
remoteness of the islands. The second is [[a]{.mark}]{.underline} more
[[holistic]{.mark} [perspective]{.mark}]{.underline} in [[which things
are seen in the totality of their relationships"]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Hau'ofa 2008, pp. 152--53; Salesa 2012). [The [oceanic and ancestral
worlds]{.mark} that Hau'ofa (2008) describes [were ones already
**mapped** and **traveled** by **indigenous
seafarers**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Diaz 2011). [They were [spaces "in
which peoples and cultures moved and mingled, unhindered by boundaries
of the kind **erected** much later by imperial
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Hau'ofa 2008, p. 154). This
sea-bound mobility, which has been most commonly associated with Pacific
Islanders, was not limited to the Pacific alone. [Indigenous peoples
traveled across multiple ocean regions, along routes that have been
eclipsed by a prevailing emphasis on terra firma.]{.underline} Inspired
in part by studies of the Black Atlantic, Cherokee scholar Jace Weaver
(2011, 2014) documents a forgotten history of indigenous mobilities
along the Atlantic Ocean region. "Indians, far from being marginal to
the Atlantic experience," he insists, "were, in fact, as central as
Africans" (Weaver 2011, p. 422). [European ships "carried the wealth of
the Americas away to Europe" but also "transported Indians in a variety
of capacities back and forth.]{.underline}" These vessels "provided for
the circulation of Native ideas and technologies (like Quinine and
Aspirin) around the \[Atlantic\] basin" (Weaver 2011, p. 454). For
Weaver (2011, 2014), the Atlantic was as "Red" as it was "Black" (Gilroy
1993).

The early spaces of European empires, some contend, were the decks of
seagoing ships (Lipmann 2015, p. 99). [[British vessels,]{.mark} we
might say, [were]{.mark} the [initial]{.mark} ["**laboratories** of
**modernity**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Stoler & Cooper 1997, p. 5). They
transported people, ideas, and commodities, while also facilitating the
physical circulation of laws, juridical processes, and legal cultures
(Mawani & Hussin 2014; Metcalf 2007; Ward 2009, p. 24). Traveling on
British ships, colonial administrators carried existing, new, and
renewed legal formats and technologies to far-flung regions of imperial
and inter-imperial worlds. Legal regimes were rethought and reworked
over the course of protracted seaborne voyages[. [**Laws** were debated,
revised, and projected,]{.underline}]{.mark} albeit not always
successfully, [[on lands and waterways **already inhabited** by
indigenous peoples]{.underline}.]{.mark} Repositioned in the world of
imperial ships, title by registration provides an illuminating example
of the interconnections, interdependence, and indivisibility of land and
sea. Initiated by Sir Robert Richard Torrens, an Irish-born colonist,
land reformer, and Australian politician, title by registration was a
land tenure system inaugurated in the nineteenth-century colony of South
Australia. Though the region was home to a large and diverse indigenous
populace[, British authorities declared the land as "wasted,"
"unoccupied," and "fit for the purposes of colonization]{.underline}"
(Banner 2008; Edmonds 2010, p. 38; Foster 2005, p. 249; Harris 2003).
Title by registration, or the Torrens system, as it came to be known,
dramatically altered land title in ways that assisted authorities in
emptying the colony of its indigenous inhabitants. It transformed
property ownership from a history of "possession," by which land was
transferred generationally and along a male lineage among the English
aristocracy, to a modern and bureaucratic system of recordkeeping that
facilitated the abstraction and commoditization of land (Bhandar 2015).
Promoted through improvement, efficiency, and expediency, registration
erased previous histories of indigenous ownership. In so doing, it made
land more readily available to British settlers in South Australia and
beyond (Bhandar 2015, Keenan 2016).

### Settlerism K\-\--Cables\-\--1NC

#### The internet and colonial politics cannot be disimbricated, coloniality exists in the ways by which we share and transfer knowledge through undersea cables. 

**Phillips et al 21 --** \[Kavita Phillips wrote about British colonial
environmental history in the 1990s and sought to decolonize computing in
the 2010s. Her work is in conversation with academic research, science
and technology policy, social movements, and advocacy groups, and has
designed curricula linking History, Public Health, Studio Arts,
Informatics, Environment, Ethics, and Critical Theory; Chapter "The
Internet Will Be Decolonized;" from Your Computer is on Fire, edited by
Kavita Phillips, Thomas Mullaney, Benjamin Peters, and Mar Hicks. (pg.
111-112).

We have seen how [forms of [representation of information online]{.mark}
[are **inseparable** from]{.mark} the [**material histories of
communication**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Older, [[**colonial-era**
infrastructures predated and **enabled**]{.mark} twentieth-century
[**cable-laying** projects.]{.mark} Geopolitics as well as **undersea**
rubble repeatedly break cables or shift routing paths. [Representational
inequities cycle into policy-making about **regulating** **access to
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Once seen as a neutral technological
affordance, [t[he internet is increasingly beginning to be understood as
a political domain]{.mark}]{.underline}---one in which
[[tech]{.mark}n]{.underline}ology [[can enhance]{.underline}]{.mark}
some kinds of [[**political power** and **suppress** **others**]{.mark},
[radically shifting our notions]{.mark} of democratic public
sphere.]{.underline} Celebrating this new technology that set the world
on fire in the late twentieth century, this chapter seeks not simply to
tar it with the brush of old politics but to ask how this fire, in all
its social, political, and technological aspects, can be tended in the
interests of an increasingly diverse global community of users.

As in Sarah Roberts's chapter ("Your AI Is a Human"), it turns out that
[[the infrastructural internet]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [creators of its
imaginaries are **connected by the labor of global
humans**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like Nathan Ensmenger ("The Cloud Is a
Factory") and Benjamin Peters ("A Network Is Not a Network"), I turn to
the history of the material, infrastructural view of the internet---a
version of the internet's origin story that was once articulated
primarily by infrastructural engineers.45 But we found that
[[there's]{.mark} [more]{.mark} than infrastructure [at play]{.mark}
here]{.underline}. As Halcyon Lawrence ("Siri Disciplines") and Tom
Mullaney ("Typing Is Dead") suggest, [[nonwhite users are increasingly
**resisting**]{.mark} the [imperial norms]{.mark} that shape our
internet-related practices]{.underline}. [[National histories and
**imperial politics** help select the stories we tell about the
**internet's** **past**]{.mark}, as well as shape what we can do with
its future]{.underline}. Seeing this requires skills in analyzing
metaphor, narrative, and social history. We find that the [[separation
of technical and cultural skills **has produced knowledge that impedes
the integrated improvement of technical design and
use.**]{.mark}]{.underline} As decolonial technological activism grows,
the power dynamics involved in this historical separation of technology
and culture will come **[under intense political and cultural
scrutiny.]{.underline}**

To revalue and resituate both technical and humanist knowledge, we need
to find better ways to teach multiple kinds of skills in media,
information, and computer science's educational and practical contexts.
[[We need stories that showcase the irreducibly political realities that
make up the global internet---the continual human labor, the mountains
of matter displaced]{.mark}, its diverse material and representational
habitats.]{.underline} [Acknowledging that **[the political and the
digital cannot be separated]{.mark}** might serve as an antidote against
the seductive ideal of technological designs untouched by the messiness
of the real world[. **Examining** the historical
**underpinnings**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of our common-sense
understandings of the internet can **lead us to insights** about the
ways in which we shape ourselves as modern**, globally connected**
technological designers and users]{.underline}]{.mark}. Using this
historical/technical lens, we are able to ask questions about the
plumbing of power implicit in every internet pipe: [**who** labored on
these connections, who owns them, who **represents** them, who
**benefits** from them?]{.underline}

Regardless of the shifting geopolitical locus of power, [the

be defined by]{.underline} [the dominance of
**western**]{.underline}(ized) human [subjects over the]{.underline}
natural **[non-western]{.underline}**(ized) world (Mignolo, 2011). [As
the world's]{.underline} emerging [powers]{.underline}, [such as
China]{.underline}, [dispute]{.underline} the supremacy of
[the]{.underline} already established **[geopolitical
order]{.underline}**, [securing]{.underline} control over the expansion
of [submarine cables]{.underline} [becomes a **key aspect**
of]{.underline} these contested [geopolitical arrangements]{.underline}.
[In light of the]{.underline} tight [relationship between
**information** and **economic regimes**]{.underline}, Christian Fuchs
(2008) argues that ["\[t\]he knowledge society]{.underline} [is
**not**]{.underline} an **[immaterial]{.underline}** society [but a
new]{.underline} phase in the [**material reality** of
**capitalism**]{.underline}. [It requires]{.underline} a [large material
**infrastructure** made up by]{.underline} computers, periphery,
servers, routers, switches, **[network cables]{.underline}**, and so on"
(p. 145). Generally speaking, transatlantic infrastructures, from
shipping routes to [fiber optic cables]{.underline}, have
[enabled]{.underline} empires, [states]{.underline}, and multinationals
[to **extract** and sanction]{.underline} the [flow of
materials]{.underline} [and **information**]{.underline} at an
accelerated rate. As material infrastructures, [submarine
cables]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [critical systems
embedded]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the mutually [constitutive
relationship between **transoceanic connectivity** and **frontier
securitization**]{.underline}. Due to their geopolitical location,
Atlantis-2 and the cable station in Conil are especially implicated in
the construction and preservation of the networks that sustain
contemporary capitalism.

This chapter suggests that [the internet is **entangled**]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the historical construction of frontiers and their
[securitization]{.underline}, [which enable geopolitical]{.underline}
[powers]{.underline} [to **sanction** the]{.underline} [flow of
**people**]{.underline}, [commodities]{.underline}, [and
information]{.underline} across the very same borders. The development
of [submarine cables]{.underline} is [historically linked]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the [expansion of empire]{.underline} and capital, both
as a form of colonial administration and control (Starosielski, 2015)
but also through the extraction of data and materials that sustain
contemporary network capitalism (Fuchs, 2008). Atlantis-2 reinforces the
transatlantic connection between South America and Europe inaugurated
during the Spanish colonial era, reviving the South Atlantic as an
active geopolitical space in the digital era. Furthermore, as a [layered
media infrastructure]{.underline}, Atlantis-2 and its landing station in
Conil inherit the strengths and limitations of this historical base upon
which they are built (Star and Bowker, 2006), which
[produces]{.underline} [a]{.underline} particular [kind of
**interconnectivity**]{.underline} that is [based on **simultaneous
securitization**]{.underline}. Analyzing the dynamic of modern
interconnection, Martin (2012) observes that [the]{.underline}
"[entwined logics of **interconnection**]{.underline} [are
determined]{.underline} b[y a precarious balance between
the]{.underline} apparent [openness of **mobility**]{.underline} flows
[and]{.underline} the [potential **stasis** of
securitisation]{.underline}" (p. 359). The apparently [frictionless flow
of digital information]{.underline} [is]{.underline} in fact deeply
[implicated with]{.underline} the administration and [regulation of
**material flows**]{.underline}, which become evident in the deep layers
of history at [the internet]{.underline}'s landing stations. Atlantis-2
and its landing station in Conil are [embedded in a non-linear network
of geopolitical relations that reveal the]{.underline} co-constitutive
[relations between **technology**, **coloniality**, and

[capabilities]{.underline} **[not previously available]{.underline}**.
[One is the [ability to track]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[maritime

Accurate [[tracking requires]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[rapid
transmission]{.underline}]{.mark}** of data [from satellites [to the
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [the problem]{.underline} here [is that
there are data transmission **bottlenecks**]{.underline}. Specifically
traditional [**radio-frequency** ([R.F.]{.mark})]{.underline} [downlink

[**struggle** to keep up]{.mark}]{.underline} [with]{.underline} the
[Gigabits of data generated every second]{.underline} from the myriad of

There is a need for low latency -- for minimal 'lag' -- in maritime
monitoring that can be significantly improved with the advent of Gbps
Optical Ground Stations. [[This points]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [vital]{.underline} supporting
[role]{.underline} [that **[optical

[Optical communications systems]{.underline}, [involved]{.underline}

transmitting data at Gigabit speeds with a path to Terabit speeds.

But [satellites with optical links]{.underline} [can **do
more**]{.underline}. Because of the significant increase in downlink
speeds, not only can [they [support]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[tracking]{.mark}** of ships]{.underline} and other maritime vessels,
but with Gbps data transmission speeds, optical ground links can
[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} an impactful alternative path and
[[**resilience** to]{.mark} the undersea cable network of

[Project HEIST]{.underline}, which was [launched by NATO]{.underline} in

the moment]{.underline}, in the interim period after a cable break
[satellite internet can provide **minimal connectivity** to support

Elon Musk's Starlink provides coverage to around 70 countries and has
often been brought in to help at short notice when disaster has struck

The [recent disruptions]{.underline} [to]{.underline} submarine [cables
in the Red Sea]{.underline} (for which Houthis deny responsibility),
such as the Asia-Africa-Europe 1, the Europe India Gateway, Seacom and
TGN-Gulf, have [impacted **25 percent**]{.underline} of [data traffic
flowing from Asia to Europe]{.underline}. [While this data has been
**rerouted**, it raises the question of whether]{.underline} our
[**current infrastructure** can support such **adjustments** on a
**regular basis**.]{.underline}

As threats to our telecommunications infrastructure increase, the need
for the international community to safeguard our global communications
infrastructure should be prioritized. A legal framework to protect these
cables exists at a national and multilateral level. At the national
level, in the United States, the Communications Security, Reliability,
and Interoperability Council provides recommendations to the Federal
Communications Commission with way to protect our communications.
Multilateral efforts, such as the Convention for the Protection of
Submarine Telegraph Cables (1884), requires that all signatories protect
international submarine cables. International treaties, such as the
United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, reinforces the 1884
treaty. Additionally, articles 113 through 115 of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea address the responsibility of the
international community to prevent the breaking or injury of subsea
cables. Organizations such as the International Cable Protection
Committee provide guidelines and recommendations to submarine cables.

[Satellite communication]{.underline} [is **increasingly
important**]{.underline} [as threats to]{.underline} [undersea
cables]{.underline} and the critical infrastructure
[required]{.underline} [for their operation increase]{.underline}.
Depending on the type of cable, [repairs]{.underline} to submarine
cables [can take]{.underline} anywhere from days to **[over a
year]{.underline}** to repair, as was the case in Tonga. The vast
majority of submarine cable disruptions are caused by fishing and
anchoring activities while other instances are caused by natural
hazards. Deliberate disruptions to our submarine cables are rare but
could increase as nefarious actors continue to challenge the global
order. [Currently]{.underline}, [satellites cannot]{.underline} replace
submarine cables because they could not [handle]{.underline} the
**[massive data flows]{.underline}** that [a submarine cable
can.]{.underline} The best [we]{.underline} [can]{.underline} do is
[continue **research and development**]{.underline}, [leading
to]{.underline} the [eventual deployment, of a satellite network that
can **replace**]{.underline} submarine [cables]{.underline} in the
future. For now, it is the responsibility of the international community
to protect submarine cables against disruptions.

#### It's the most [consistent]{.underline} redundancy option and resolves [every]{.underline} aff scenario.

Jack **Haddon 24**, deputy editor of The Tech Capital, \"Satellites
being used to mitigate Red Sea cable cuts\", Capacity Media,
https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2cxwfv3edqrmwybmbrtaa/news/red-sea-cable-cuts-sees-organisations-turn-to-satellite-connectivity,
3-7-2024//ILake-AW

[Following]{.underline} the [disruption to]{.underline}
[network]{.underline} traffic [passing through the Red Sea]{.underline}
this week as a result of three subsea cables being cut, [network
operators are **rerouting traffic** to transfer data]{.underline}
[between Europe and Asia.]{.underline}

As per industry reports, the most common alternative routes appear to be
other subsea cables passing through the Red Sea, or fibre routes passing
through China or even the Pacific.

But Rhys Morgan, general manager and VP, media and networks, EMEA at
Intelsat is seeing demand for satellite capacity as well.

"We\'ve had reports from customers that they're seeing a slowdown in
some of their Internet connectivity," he tells Capacity.

Morgan notes that disruption to data traffic passing through the Red Sea
has been a concern for sometime due to the Houthi militants potential to
target the infrastructure.

"It\'s something we\'ve been keeping an eye on more broadly over a long
period of time," he says. "[We've been working]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} large [customers to make sure]{.underline} that
[they\'ve got a **hybrid approach** to networking]{.underline}."

Morgan is keen to emphasise that [a hybrid approach]{.underline} [to
networking]{.underline} [is **crucial** in **times of
disruption**,]{.underline} as seen this week.

Intelsat have implemented short-term services for customers that have
suffered disruption in light of the cuts.

"As part of a hybrid network approach, [customers]{.underline} will
[look for mission critical or **highly sensitive
communications**]{.underline} [to be passed through
different]{.underline} [means]{.underline}," he explains. "Fibre may be
their primary method, but satellite connectivity could be on standby as
a backup".

[Satellite connectivity]{.underline} [in its current form]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [well]{.underline} enough [equipped
to **completely replace**]{.underline} the [vast]{.underline}
[quantities of data]{.underline} that travel through subsea cables every
day. [But]{.underline} for certain types of data, [the technology can
offer a **suitable alternative**]{.underline}.

Morgan argues that [if an enterprise or organisation]{.underline} [has
data flow]{.underline} that [it can\'t live without]{.underline}, or
can\'t afford to be concerned about its security, then [satellite
is]{.underline} often [a good]{.underline} [ingredient]{.underline}
[into a hybrid network]{.underline} [approach]{.underline}.

"[Satellite networks]{.underline} can [transmit data from **point A to
point B**]{.underline} [without touching]{.underline} **[any other
point]{.underline}** on the globe," he says.

This means the [routing]{.underline} [is **completely
transparent**]{.underline} to Intelsat's [customer]{.underline}, [and
prevents **further interference** or other **points of
failure**]{.underline}.

"From a sort of security perspective, [it\'s a **highly
attractive**]{.underline} [option]{.underline} [because we\'re
not]{.underline} [pushing signals]{.underline} or pushing content data
[through **multiple different areas**]{.underline}," Morgan says.

"[Then from resiliency perspective]{.underline} [satellites
are]{.underline} pretty **[robust]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} from
a service perspective, [once they\'re up]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} typically **[work incredibly well]{.underline}** for
their lifetimes. The [service impact from technical issues]{.underline},
deliberate or otherwise, [is]{.underline} generally, pretty
**[tiny]{.underline}**."

This is true even when services are not disrupted, and Morgan thinks
that the Red Sea issues this week bring into sharp focus the importance
of a hybrid approach to networking.

\"Satellite connectivity, especially LEO, [is an interesting
**redundancy option**]{.underline} for individual end-users, [such as
enterprises]{.underline}, [governments]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
some **[military use cases]{.underline}**. In such scenarios, satellite
connectivity makes a lot of sense as a redundant data pathway,
[maintaining connectivity regardless of **terrestrial** or **submarine
incidents**]{.underline},\" agrees Dr. Thomas King, chief technology
officer, DE-CIX, a global Internet Exchange (IX) operator that was
impacted by the Red Sea Cuts.

#### It will [eliminate]{.underline} the need for undersea cables.

Daniel **Meierhans 23**, researcher at the University of Zurizh \"Lasers
enable internet backbone via satellite, may soon eliminate need for
deep-sea cables\", No Publication,
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-06-lasers-enable-internet-backbone-satellite.html,
6-20-2023//ILake-AW

[Optical data communications]{.underline} [lasers]{.underline} can
[transmit several]{.underline} [**tens of terabits** per
second,]{.underline} [despite]{.underline} a huge amount of
**[disruptive air turbulence]{.underline}**. [ETH Zurich
scientists]{.underline} [and]{.underline} their [European
partners]{.underline} [demonstrated]{.underline} this
**[capacity]{.underline}** [with lasers]{.underline} between the
mountain peak, Jungfraujoch, and the city of Bern in Switzerland. [This
will soon]{.underline} [**eliminate the necessity** of]{.underline}
expensive **[deep-sea cables.]{.underline}**

[The backbone of the internet]{.underline} [is]{.underline} formed by a
dense network of [fiber-optic cables]{.underline}, each of which
transports up to more than 100 terabits of data per second (1 terabit =
1012 digital 1/0 signals) between the network nodes. The connections
between continents take place via deep sea networks---which is an
enormous expense: [a single cable]{.underline} across the Atlantic
[requires]{.underline} an investment of [**hundreds of millions** of
dollars]{.underline}. TeleGeography, a specialized consulting firm,
announced that there currently are 530 active undersea cables---and that
number is on the rise.

Soon, however, [this]{.underline} [expense may **drop**]{.underline}
substantially. [Scientists]{.underline} at ETH Zurich, working together
with partners from the space industry, have [demonstrated]{.underline}
[terabit optical data]{.underline} [transmission]{.underline} through
the air in a European Horizon 2020 project. [In the future]{.underline},
this [will enable]{.underline} much more [**cost‑effective**
and]{.underline} much [**faster** backbone connections]{.underline} via
near-earth satellite constellations. Their work is published in the
journal Light: Science & Applications.

Submarine Cable Problems

[Undersea cables]{.underline} [have **vulnerabilities**]{.underline},
[primarily]{.underline} [**dredging** from commercial]{.underline}
[fishing]{.underline} nets. They can also be damaged by anchors dropped
from ships, chewed by marine life, hit by natural disasters and
sabotage. Another drawback---laying [at depths of]{.underline} up to
[6500 feet,]{.underline} [underwater cables are **not easy to
maintain.**]{.underline}

[**Security** is also an issue]{.underline} for submarine cables.
[**Maps** of undersea cables]{.underline} [are **publicly
available**]{.underline} [so]{.underline} that [shipping can avoid
damaging cables by accident]{.underline}. [This makes]{.underline} the
[information **accessible** to **criminal agents**]{.underline}. [There
have been malicious incidents]{.underline} [of]{.underline} breaking or
[**tapping into** submarine]{.underline} [cable
communications]{.underline}, both in the private sector and by
governments.

Why Don't Companies Use Satellites Instead?

First, let's review a quick primer of satellites used for communication.

[Satellite's work]{.underline} [by **beaming information**
through]{.underline} [space]{.underline}, [relaying radio
frequency]{.underline} (RF) [signals]{.underline} from satellite to
satellite, [and]{.underline}/or [moving with the **rotation of
earth**]{.underline} to compensate for the curve of the earth, as well
as sending signals to the ground. Most are in a Low Earth Orbit (LEO),
99 to 1,200 miles above earth, though some reside in Geosynchronous
Equatorial Orbit (GEO), about 22,000 miles above earth. There is a
longer communication time lag (latency) the farther away a satellite is
from earth. Many critical communication satellites reside in LEO, and
the space is getting crowded. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) has authorized SpaceX to fly 30,000 satellites in LEO. We'll
discuss more about satellites in a future article, including advancement
in the private sector driven by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Communication [satellite expansion has **little to do** with submarine
cable **deficiencies**]{.underline}. [Satellite's greatest strength is
reaching **far-flung places**]{.underline} around the globe [not yet
connected by fiber]{.underline}. Musk said SpaceX satellites are
"especially [for those where]{.underline} [connectivity is
nonexistent]{.underline}, [**too expensive** or
**unreliable**]{.underline}." [Satellites also]{.underline} have the
advantage of [distributing content]{.underline} from one source [to
**multiple locations**]{.underline}. Then there is 5G---the
fifth-generation mobile network. To fulfill their role in 5G,
communication companies need stable access to a satellite spectrum in
LEO.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Cyberattacks\-\--2NC

#### [Decentralization]{.underline} and [new tech]{.underline} solve.

Jordan **Mcdonald 25**, \"\'MeshSatNet\' Boosts In-Orbit Cyber
Resilience at Space Force\", GovCIO Media & Research,
https://govciomedia.com/meshsatnet-boosts-in-orbit-cyber-resilience-at-space-force/,
1-29-2025//ILake-AW

[The Space Force]{.underline} [is pioneering]{.underline} **[new
technologies]{.underline}** and concepts [like
"**MeshSatNet**]{.underline}" [to enhance **cyber resilience** and
safeguard **critical in-orbit systems**]{.underline}, Lt. Col. Marouane
Balmakhtar, S6C division chief of cyber operations at the service, told
GovCIO Media & Research.

In today's world, satellites are considered a part of the nation's
critical infrastructure, powering global systems like communications,
GPS navigation, weather forecasting and national security. It's critical
to protect not only the space-borne satellites, but also the terrestrial
receivers that support them.

"Securing these networks is crucial because any disruption can have
far-reaching consequences, affecting everything from civilian
communications to military operations. [Space systems
provide]{.underline} [critical infrastructure for both government and
private sectors]{.underline}, [supporting]{.underline} [everything from
**economic activity** to **international security**]{.underline},"
Balmakhtar said. "[A successful cyberattack]{.underline} on satellites
[could disable these systems]{.underline}, [leading to]{.underline}
widespread service **[outages]{.underline}**, loss of data [and
**national security risks**]{.underline}."

Bad actors are capable of disrupting satellite networks through a number
of methods like jamming, sending false signals to satellite receivers,
hacking and even physical attack.

The consequences of an attack could be dire. Balmakhtar said that if a
satellite network were to be disrupted, it could lead to "disrupted
communications, compromised security data, degraded military
capabilities and potentially significant economic losses from
interruptions in essential services," like air traffic, shipping or
autonomous vehicle navigation.

The primary challenge in securing satellites lies in their complexity.
Operating in-orbit makes them inherently difficult to service, as any
physical repairs warrant going into space to service the satellite or
bringing it down to Earth, where it will go through a full replacement
cycle.

Legacy systems already in orbit also present a challenge, as many of
them do not have the cybersecurity considerations of more modern
systems. Balmakthar said this could lead to "gaps in defense and
inconsistent standards across the industry."

According to Balmakhtar, linking legacy and newer satellites would
require a interoperability protocols and technologies to integrate
legacy satellites without disrupting operations or requiring a complete
overhaul. [Balmakhtar]{.underline} [is exploring how the Space Force
could **retrofit older satellites** with **updated tech**, and develop
common platforms and encryption standards]{.underline}, [to unify
**old** and **new** systems]{.underline}. He coined the term
"MeshSatNet" to explain this concept.

"In a mesh network, [each satellite is connected to others]{.underline},
[creating **multiple pathways** for data transmission]{.underline}.
[This **decentralized approach** makes it **harder** for bad actors to
disrupt the entire system]{.underline}, as [attacks on one
satellite]{.underline} [would have **limited impact**]{.underline} on
the overall network," said Balmakhtar.

#### Optical communications are [resilient]{.underline} to cyberattacks.

Security Advantages of Optical Communications in SATCOM Networks\",

\*QKD = Quantum Key Distribution

Space launches and the ability for small organizations to be able to
place satellites into orbit is becoming increasingly cheaper and easier.
[With]{.underline} this [new era of]{.underline}
[commoditizing]{.underline} [space]{.underline} for economic and
scientific purposes, [the **attack surface** for]{.underline}
[cybercriminals is growing]{.underline}. With this growing attack
surface, proper practices and policies are not growing in parallel with
that attack surface. This disproportionate growth of these two factors
can quickly lead to catastrophic cybersecurity incidents that could lead
to massive costs in damages that can happen to valuable space
infrastructure. Moving forward [security needs to be
addressed]{.underline} more [seriously when designing]{.underline} and
developing [satellites]{.underline} and SATCOM networks as well as
terrestrial-based systems that communicate with orbiting satellites.
Many approaches should be practiced to improve the current state of
SATCOM security and [one of the **best solutions**]{.underline} [put
forth]{.underline} in this paper [is the migration to **optical
network** as opposed to]{.underline} [traditional RF
network]{.underline}. Not only does [optics provide **more
bandwidth**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} it [offers]{.underline}
[**better security** due to the **narrow beam diameter** in comparison
to RF]{.underline}, [as well as the ability to **integrate QKD** within
the same channel used for communications.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--AT: Sabotage\-\--2NC

#### Various new Space Force initiatives [increase resilience]{.underline}.

Courtney **Albon 24**, C4ISRNET\'s space and emerging technology
reporter, \"How the Space Force is making its systems more resilient\",
C4ISRNet,
https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/2024/04/18/how-the-space-force-is-making-its-systems-more-resilient/,
4-18-2024//ILake-AW

[When Space Force leaders talk]{.underline} [about
**resilience**]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} often [point to
**proliferation**]{.underline} --- [distributing
capabilities]{.underline} [across **large constellations**]{.underline}
of small satellites --- as central to their approach [to making it
**harder for adversaries** to disrupt U.S. operations.]{.underline}

The premise that redundancy and disaggregation provide inherent
resilience underpins the Space Development Agency's multi-layered
Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, which aims to field hundreds
of communications and missile tracking satellites by 2026.

But [proliferation is just **one piece**]{.underline} of the Space
Force's strategy for safeguarding its capabilities. [It's also about
ensuring satellites and ground systems]{.underline} [are equipped with
**sensors** and]{.underline} other **[cybersecurity
features]{.underline}** that can detect and protect against threats.

A little-known panel of acquisition experts from Space Systems Command
known as the Enterprise Resilience Board has been working over the last
year to determine what those measures are and ensure that the
capabilities the Space Force buys meet its requirements for resilience.

Claire Leon leads SSC's Space Systems Integration Office, which chairs
the Enterprise Resilience Board. She told reporters the board's job is
to work with program teams to make sure the necessary protective
capabilities are part of a program's initial requirements.

"Then, when a proposal is put out, you want that to be built into the
proposal so that you're asking for those protective measures from a
contractor in a time of competition, not adding it later," she said
April 10 on the sidelines of the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs,
Colo.

The [Defense Department]{.underline} has [placed]{.underline} a
[**greater emphasis** on the need for]{.underline} [**space system
resilience** over the last five years]{.underline}, [as]{.underline}
adversaries like [**Russia** and **China**]{.underline} have [increased
their aggression]{.underline} in the domain. And as the Chinese
government eyes a possible invasion of Taiwan by 2027, [the Space Force
is working to ensure its satellites and ground systems can
operate]{.underline} **[through disruption]{.underline}** [should they
be targeted]{.underline}.

[U.S. Space Command Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting told
reporters]{.underline} at the symposium [that space system
**survivability** and **resilience** is at the top of his
list]{.underline} of near-term readiness needs.

"As we increase our capability and capacity across a number of
constellations, I would like to see them become more resilient," Whiting
told reporters during an April 9 briefing. "I want all of that as fast
as possible."

[Many]{.underline} of the [protection measures]{.underline} the
Enterprise Resilience Board considers are classified, according to Leon,
but they [include]{.underline} things like adding [**anti-jam**
capabilities]{.underline} to a satellite communications system [or
installing]{.underline} a **[space domain awareness]{.underline}**
[sensor that can sniff out a potential adversary.]{.underline}

### Solvency\-\--AT: Sabotage\-\--Nuclear ASAT

#### Russia is [incapable]{.underline} of nuclear ASATs and the tech is [far off]{.underline}.

While [Russia is]{.underline} [moving]{.underline} forward in its
attempt [to develop a]{.underline} dangerous [new **nuclear capability**
in space,]{.underline} [it is **not poised** to deploy such a
device]{.underline} in the immediate future, according to two people
familiar with U.S. intelligence on the matter.

[Moscow still needs to **complete** its work]{.underline} on an
anti-satellite weapon with nuclear technology --- the threat flagged
this week in intelligence circulating on Capitol Hill. And [it is not
clear Moscow]{.underline} [has the **ability**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} successfully [launch it]{.underline} into orbit if it
does perfect its weapon, the two people, who were granted anonymity to
discuss classified material, said.

the [Biden]{.underline} administration and some lawmakers on Capitol
Hill [who have seen the intel]{.underline} [argue that

yet**.]{.underline}

"This is not an active capability that's been deployed," National
Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters Thursday.
"Though Russia's pursuit of this particular capability is troubling,
[there is **no immediate threat."**]{.underline}

Why Canada's Quantum Sensing Development Matters,"

jliu

Quantum technology takes advantage of the turbulent nature of atoms in
their non-observed state. This allows atoms to hold multiple states at
once and causes an increase in efficiency and accuracy of measurements
and problem-solving. The buzz around quantum technology has been centred
on the mission to create the perplexing quantum computer, which has
evaded invention. Such a computer would hasten the ability to solve
problems previously unsolvable by the classic computer. Corporations
have capitalized on showing off the aspects of quantum development
to garner support for the development of a quantum computer, with
companies like OMERS, Xanadu, and D-Wave all receiving support from the
Canadian government. Canadian allies like the United Kingdom and [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates have [invested millions]{.mark}
[into developing the]{.mark} high-speed
**[computer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet, [[**Canada** has chosen to
focus]{.mark} elsewhere, [on]{.mark} the most mature of quantum
technologies: **[quantum sensing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With quantum
computing in the spotlight, it might seem like quantum sensing is less
important. Although not as flashy as other quantum developments, quantum
sensing is poised to revolutionize military and surveillance
technologies.

Quantum sensing is an umbrella term that refers to technologies
perceived more as innovation rather than an invention, as [[Canada's
**interest**]{.mark} in quantum sensing [has **directly related**
to building upon]{.mark} already [understood **classical**
sensing]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, it is implied that
quantum sensing is less revolutionary than its quantum siblings: the
computing and communication domains. In recent years, the quantum
computing and communications domains have been amplified as new
creations with stark consequences and significant impacts on the
technological landscape. However, the lack of recognition of the impact
that quantum sensing will have on both the defence and commercial
industries is misguided. The technology that falls under the scope of
quantum sensing extends to everything from metrology to gravimeters and
photonics, which are all able to give precise analyses of the natural
environment. The variety of uses that are provided by quantum sensing is
part of the reason for the lack of coverage on the technology, as there
is so much to cover. The lack of flashy and identifiable singular
changes may not entice the layman, but for those who know what to look
for, quantum sensing's appeal is found in the details. For instance,
quantum sensors are easily disturbed, making them incredibly sensitive
and able to pick up on a variety of environmental changes that a
classical sensor would miss. These sensors have been
deemed "dual-use" for their versatility and have been projected to be
enormously effective in both business and on the battlefield; as such,
industry and government have jumped to develop quantum sensing.

[[Canada's **investment**]{.mark} in quantum sensing [started]{.mark}
before the publication of its *National Quantum Strategy* in
the *Quantum Science and Technology Strategy*]{.underline}* *in
2020*,* [[where **quantum sensing** was]{.mark} first [identified as a
**solution** to the issues of **charting** the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other [usages identified included
[**stealth resistance**, **chemical detection**, **increased
navigation**]{.mark} in GPS-denied areas, [and]{.mark} specific
**[meteorological analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Quantum sensing
developments have also been appointed as the top two missions of the
Department of National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces' most recent
quantum strategy, *Quantum 2030.* For example, enhanced radar and Light
Detection and Ranging technology (a form of laser-based radar) have been
prioritized to keep up with potential threats entering Canadian airspace
and advancing stealth technologies. Canada has held several grant
competitions with allies such as the U.K. as well as innovation programs
like "Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security" to stimulate
quantum sensing innovations. The Department of National Defence has
offered grants of up to \$3 million for those able to contribute to the
innovation effort.

[Despite global attention to quantum computing, we can understand
**[Canada's]{.mark}** multifaceted [investment]{.mark} into quantum
sensing [because of]{.mark} the many **[benefits]{.mark}** that these
[technologies bring **specifically** to the roles]{.mark} that
[**Canada** plays in the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Canada were to
become the forerunner of quantum sensing, [[**Canada** would be
**indispensable** as an intelligence ally]{.mark} and be able to
contribute extensively]{.underline} to North American Aerospace Defense
Command (NORAD) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) goals. In
light of growing pressure from American and European politicians for
Canada to carry its fair share for NORAD and NATO, targeted investments
into [[**quantum sensing** may help Canada]{.mark} [contribute
**world-leading** technology]{.mark} to these alliances]{.underline}.
There is also the potential for Canada to spearhead adversarial actions,
detecting violations of Canadian airspace or pinpointing the positioning
of nuclear submarines, especially in the Arctic where remote
surveillance has always been a challenge. In light of rapidly developing
drone technology and clearer pathways for submarine activity, the
promise of ultra-sensitive sensors could not come a moment too soon.
The climate benefits are also nothing to ignore: the high sensitivity of
a quantum sensor could detect natural disasters faster, allowing
warnings to go out earlier and saving lives. Increased functionality in
GPS-denied areas and conditions which are environmentally difficult to
monitor would also significantly strengthen search and rescue efforts.
Such a strategy has already been implemented in the United Kingdom,
where quantum technology is attached to navy ships to aid in the
monitoring of oil pollution and more precise time measurements for
day-to-day operations[. [As Canadian **search and rescue** resources
are]{.mark} stretched **[thin]{.mark}**, technological
**[advancements]{.mark}** in the most extreme conditions [will
have]{.mark} an immediate **[domestic benefit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[PPP Collaborations Speed]{.mark} the **[Pace of
Change]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Competition among nations for quantum technology has **spurred the
growth of the PPP ecosystem**.]{.underline} Quantum science developments
hold profound implications for security practices and international
relations. Defense, intelligence and civilian contractors are engaging
researchers in proof-of-concept projects that are bringing quantum
innovations closer to commercial application. The U.S. government has
pledged \$3.7 billion to quantum computing projects, according to an
April 2024 McKinsey report.

Federal investments support quantum trailblazers through regional
partnerships. IBM, Microsoft and quantum companies such as Infleqtion
and qBraid participate in the Bloch, a PPP quantum collaboration in line
for a share of the \$70 million in grants the U.S. Economic Development
Administration will award this year. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker
predicts that 30,000 jobs will emerge from the Bloch's \$650 million in
public and private funding.

The consortium extends the research muscle of the federally run Argonne
National Laboratory and Fermilab, making the Midwest a cradle of quantum
development. F[our leading research universities are Bloch partners ---
Chicago, Illinois, Northwestern and Wisconsin --- and partner [companies
are engaged in]{.mark} a wide range of quantum technologies, from
quantum processors and algorithms to **[precise quantum
sensors]{.mark}** and secure quantum communications.]{.underline} The
Bloch is eligible to apply for millions of dollars in federal funding to
implement programs to bring their discoveries closer to
commercialization.

At the daylong Notre Dame event, industry advisers did more than soak up
dining-table talk. Professors from the CQT academic partners --- Purdue,
Indiana and Indiana University--Purdue University Indianapolis as well
as Notre Dame --- gave 17 research presentations. In a closed meeting,
we gave feedback and recommended which projects should get CQT funding
toward postdoctoral and graduate student salaries, travel and access to
resources such as quantum computer or fabrication hardware.

[The industry advisers talked among themselves about their own projects
as well. Such close [PPP]{.mark} collaboration [exposes industry to
**academic innovations**]{.mark}, but it also sets the stage for joint
proof-of-concept projects in which the partners work out novel
ideas.]{.underline} For instance, a quantum state can't be intercepted
without destroying it. The theory of a hyper-secure, no-eavesdropping
quantum internet is to transmit entangled qubits, swapping photons in a
series of relays. But hardware for these quantum repeaters is still
being built. Such work was under discussion there.

How Partnerships Drive Success

Quantum has the excitement of the early internet, with revelations still
to come. But the CQT's competition for funding has echoes of the more
focused Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency contests of two
decades ago. The DARPA Grand Challenge awarded \$1 million to the first
academic team to complete a competition route with an autonomous
vehicle. The collaborations were an early test of artificial
intelligence, machine vision and sensor systems. The MacGyver-like
vehicles that ran the DARPA Grand Challenge course provided a proof of
concept toward today's still nascent self-driving cars.

[The partnership track has since become the **federal model** for
applying early-stage technologies to **solving end-user
problems**.]{.underline} In pharma, for instance, data-sharing programs
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership have sped drug discovery in
the past decade for Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, lupus, Parkinson's
disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

Quantum partnerships not only extend research to private sector partners
but also build vendor networks with relevant hardware, software or
service capabilities. In quantum communications, developers must string
together services such as Ciena's coherent optics platform, Toshiba's
quantum key distribution solutions and Microsoft's Azure Quantum cloud
service. Business partners and contacts are instrumental in finding
manufacturers and subcontractors with quantum expertise.

[[The quantum orbit now includes **state PPP
collaborations**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Illinois, Gov. Pritzker backs
a \$500 million plan, with \$200 million in matching funds, to develop a
cryogenic facility and quantum campus in the state. Neighboring Indiana
carved out \$4 million for quantum-ready capacity upgrades to the
state's communications infrastructure under the Indiana READI program.

Indiana's program channels \$500 million in public, private and
philanthropic funding to a swath of economic development, education and
resiliency projects. Local governments are encouraged to participate,
setting priorities and bringing local expertise to support costly
capital decisions. [[As quantum]{.mark}, AI and other technologies
[spread, state and local partners will play a more **critical
role**]{.mark}, possibly providing tax incentives or abatements
[for]{.mark} the quantum computers, data centers and [**fiber optic

[One of the [big]{.mark}gest [schism]{.mark}s [between **Western science
and Indigenous knowledge**]{.mark} is the nature of how
conclusions]{.underline} and observations [are made]{.underline}. Vivek
Shandas, founder and director of the Sustaining Urban Places Research
Lab at Portland State University, describes much of Western science's
data collection and research paradigm as "measure it and then it has
meaning." [Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}, on the other hand, often
[comes from a culturally informed,]{.underline} and purely observational
[place]{.underline}.

[[To get around]{.underline}]{.mark} this potential
[[incompatibility]{.underline}]{.mark}, James Rattling Leaf, Sr., member
of South Dakota's Rosebud Sioux tribe has [advocate]{.underline}d [for
[a third mode, called **ethical space**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Ethical space can be compared to]{.underline} the [coaching
staff]{.underline} on a football team. [[Scientists]{.mark} [and
Indigenous knowledge holders]{.mark} act as the defensive and offensive
coordinators, respectively.]{.underline} [Each]{.underline} coordinator
[[come]{.mark}s [with]{.mark} different skills and **[different
strategies that help]{.mark}** the team]{.underline}. Additionally,
[[neither]{.mark} coordinator [questions]{.mark} the legitimacy of
[their counterpart]{.mark}'s plan, validates each other's methods, or
modifies each other's strategies. This allows [both]{.mark}]{.underline}
plans [to be **[equally instrumental]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} team's [overall [success]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
way, [[ethical space]{.mark} [leaves]{.mark} the **[core
values]{.mark}** of [Western science and **indigenous
knowledge**]{.mark} intact while providing room for them to **mutually
share** their most useful]{.underline} problem-solving
[assets]{.underline}.

"As [Indigenous people]{.underline} we [don't say we don't like science;
we]{.underline} do [use it \[too\], but we also understand that we also
bring our knowledge]{.underline} too," Rattling Leaf says.

Rattling Leaf adds that [it's possible to "consider \[and\] learn the
principles]{.underline} and protocols [of the two ways of
knowing]{.underline}." According to Rattling Leaf, [[ethical space is
the venue in which]{.mark} larger **[existential battles]{.mark}** like
climate change [can be fought]{.mark}]{.underline}. He notes that an
[ethical space framework allowed cultural]{.underline} burning
[practices to finally be considered]{.underline} a [more
serious]{.underline} wildfire mitigation strategy.

Rattling Leaf puts this framework into practice as a tribal engagement
specialist for the North Central Climate Adaptation Science Center.  The
regional Climate Adaptation Science Centers managed by the US Geological
Survey are an example of a scientific enterprise formally making space
for Indigenous knowledge. The centers fund research projects that
generate data sets and tools to help natural and cultural resource
managers respond to climate change. The centers work with tribal nations
to ensure that tribal leadership can act as co-primary investigators on
research endeavors.

In August, the US Geological Survey finalized an agreement to add more
consortium members into the Alaska, Northwest, and Southeast Climate
Adaptation Science Centers, specifically more tribal organizations. This
expansion "reflect\[s\] our continued commitment to providing accessible
climate adaptation science for the landscapes and communities that need
it most," Doug Beard, the national chief of the Climate Adaptation
Science Centers, said in a press release.

[[Ethical space can]{.mark} also [create "**cultural
safety**]{.mark}]{.underline}" and "psychological safety" [for
Indigenous partners in scientific research]{.underline}. PolArctic, an
oceanographic and data science company providing business and policy
advising [**[throughout the Arctic]{.mark}**, has used it to maintain
cultural]{.underline} and psychological [safety for]{.underline} its
[Indigenous clients in Alaska]{.underline}. As Leslie Canavera, CEO of
PolArctic, explains, [even when Western scientists see]{.underline} the
[value in Indigenous knowledge, they often]{.underline} behave
like "parachute researchers" who [create purely extractive relationships
with tribal partners]{.underline}. Parachute researchers use Indigenous
knowledge without care to how it's applied, collected, or whether the
subsequent research benefits the tribal nations at all. This is where
Canavera's work with PolArctic is unique.

"One of the good things also is that we're a business, and we're not
researchers," she says. "Researchers publish all their data, and
communities want to be able to control their own information and data."

[The [proprietary nature]{.mark}]{.underline} of PolArctic's work
[[means that it's **better able to protect generational
knowledge**]{.mark} important to these communities]{.underline}. In
doing so, PolArctic is also able to disrupt the Arctic "data desert."
PolArctic uses remote sensing data from satellites to provide advice to
its clients throughout the Arctic. [Remote sensing data doesn't capture
everything, and]{.underline} in situ [[observations in the Arctic are
difficult]{.mark} [due to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions. PolArctic used [[Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark} to [work around these issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"The Canadian government had a resource called the Nunavut Coastal
Resource Inventory," Canavera explains. "\[In it\] they had gone to a
bunch of elders and community members and said 'Where do you find polar
bears? Where you find seals?', and they drew \[that\] on the maps."

PolArctic digitized these maps, and along with remote sensing data, used
this information to [train artificial intelligence models to locate
different species in the Arctic. **[The value add for the Inuit]{.mark}
[community]{.mark}** [was immediate and immense. It gave
them]{.mark}]{.underline} marine farming [[data]{.mark} in detail---and
[in the local language]{.mark}---that they didn't have
before]{.underline}.

From a technical standpoint, Canavera sees what PolArctic did as a proof
of concept for how artificial intelligence and Indigenous knowledge can
fit hand-in-glove to improve research. Because Indigenous knowledge is
more of a static data output (it's not a variable that's changing
rapidly) it works better in artificial intelligence models than some
physics-based weather and climate models where outputs change as
conditions change. Beyond that, artificial intelligence could incubate
projects that incorporate more types of climate data coming out of
Indigenous knowledge spaces.

"How \[ice and snow\] smells actually changes based on different
temperatures," Canavera explains. "That's been a lot of the conversation
in communities about how the smell is changing, the sound is changing,
but western science has no room for those kinds of observations."

[[Without ethical space as an **intellectual meeting-ground**, these
benefits]{.mark} to the community [and]{.mark} the
**[tech]{.mark}nological [advancements]{.mark}** [would not be
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"[Ethical space welcomes Indigenous elders as valid holders
of]{.underline} important [information as well as a PhD]{.underline}
person," Rattling Leaf says. "[We don't see one as greater]{.underline}
than the other."

[[Treating Western science]{.mark} tools [and Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark} holders [as **equal**]{.mark} **contributors**
allowed]{.underline} PolArctic [to [root the science]{.mark}
research]{.underline} and deliverables [[**in the lived experience** of
the]{.mark} [Inuit community]{.mark}]{.underline}. This line of thinking
has also inspired contemporary community science endeavors.

[As the receding ice conditions allow for (relatively) safer navigation
along the [Arctic]{.mark}'s waterways for longer periods of time and
technological progression in the development of smart submarines
continues unabatedly, a **[cable race]{.mark}** seems to have [begun to
take hold]{.mark} in the region; a development that could turn the
region's maritime domain into a critical global data chokepoint. For its
part, [NATO]{.mark}, which is currently in the midst of fine-tuning its
High North strategy, [needs to recognise]{.mark} the [importance
of]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} as an emerging global data
nerve centre and devise a well-defined
plan [for]{.mark} the [protection of ]{.mark}these [cables]{.mark}. [Failure]{.mark} to
do so
would **[jeopardise]{.mark}** the [Alliance's air, land and naval operations]{.mark} and/or
presence [in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Arctic cables matter for a number of reasons. They are considerably
**shorter** than those that traverse through the established routes like
the Suez Canal and the Strait of Malacca. Hence, they tend to
substantially increase the **speed of data transfer** between Europe,
Asia and North America. They are also less vulnerable to malfunctioning
and/or interruption.]{.underline} Only a handful of states have the
required capabilities for carrying out sabotage operations in the Arctic
Ocean while the lower volume of vessel' traffic as well as the Arctic's
own geological specificities reduce the likelihood of damage by either
anchors or undersea earthquakes.

Thanks to their ability to accelerate intercontinental data transfers,
moreover, operationalisation of
these [[cables]{.underline}]{.mark} would
directly benefit industries such as telecommunication, space,
and defence. In a sense, subsea cables are nothing short of strategic
and intelligence assets that enable countries which control them, or
through whose territories they pass, to intercept data, better defend
and monitor the global cyberspace, and develop their space industries.

As data reaches strategic parity with energy for economic growth and
national security, similarly, sustained access to data will be a
critical prerequisite for both the smooth functioning of cross border
infrastructural networks and one's ability to standardise the use of
data and digital applications. [This is best evident in the case
of China's Digital Silk Road initiative which has
prompted Chinese companies to increase their investment in, and
ownership of, cellular wireless infrastructures, submarine and
terrestrial cables, and data centres within the broader BRI
framework]{.underline}

[Given the above, it is a matter of prudent decision making for
[NATO]{.mark} to [incorporate]{.mark} the [**protection of undersea
cables** into its future Arctic strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Put
broadly, one can identify two categories of threats in relation to the
subsea cables in the Arctic: states abilities to intercept data and/or
damage the cables and the ownership structures of the current and future
projects. [[NATO]{.mark}'s efforts at [revitalising]{.mark} its
[political role could receive a **much-needed boost** if the Alliance
positions itself]{.mark} to become the venue of choice for high level
talks with regard to the latter. However, it is the former that ought to
take the center stage in NATO's [deliberations]{.mark} not least because
it better [suit]{.mark}s its main objective of [**proactive defence**
against hybrid threats]{.mark} in the Euro-Atlantic zone.]{.underline}

According to a recent study by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, adversaries such as Russia could be motivated to
damage or hack undersea cables in order to gain access to trade and
military secrets. This poses a threat on an operational level,
especially in the initial phase of a conflict, and tactical level by
bringing socio-economic life to a standstill. Adding credibility to such
assertions is the fact that Moscow has been steadily expanding its
capabilities to tap undersea cables and in fact it is highly suspected
to have had a direct role in the recent outage of undersea cables
between Svalbard and mainland Norway.

[As such, [NATO needs to adopt a]{.mark} proactive [stance on **ensuring
the security of Arctic**]{.mark}'s future and current [cables]{.mark}
not least because it is set to become the most dominant security actor
in the region once Finland and Sweden membership processes are
finalised. Equally important is the fact that [there exists **no clear
legal framework** for the usage and repair of]{.mark} (damaged)
[undersea cables]{.mark} in times of conflict. To this end, NATO must
increase its naval assets in the Arctic so it can surveil the region's
waterways better.]{.underline} This could be done as part of its current
push for the establishment of an Enhanced Forward Presence in Norway as
well as its planned investment for the development and deployment of
more high tech assets in its naval operations. More importantly, member
states, especially the seven Arctic nations, must facilitate NATO's
participation in repairing the damaged cables by classifying such
activities as matters of national security. [Doing so has the added
advantage of paving the way for the Alliance to contribute to the
development of a legal framework for the governance of undersea
cables.]{.underline}

[Is [vital internet infrastructure at risk from
new]{.mark} Russian [naval capabilities]{.mark}? [NATO's military
leadership has warned]{.mark} in recent months that the [Russian navy is
**aggressively probing** undersea communications cable networks]{.mark}.
These cables form a global infrastructure system that transmits 99
percent of the international data sent over the internet. Should we be
concerned?]{.underline} Despite the ominous warnings, defense officials
have not provided much specific information about the actual substance
of the Russian threat.[ In the worst scenario, an attack that cut
submarine cables coming into the United States could significantly harm
its access to the global internet.]{.underline} Ordinary users would
probably experience massive losses in bandwidth, particularly for
services such as Google and Facebook that host much of their data
overseas. Since most government also relies on commercial internet
infrastructure, the outages would also interrupt official
communications. Any data hosted outside the U.S. would become nearly
inaccessible to U.S. parties and vice versa. For people who depend on
the internet in daily life, such an attack would be a national disaster.
But it is not clear whether NATO believes Russia has the capability or
the intention of attacking cable networks in that fashion. What is known
about this problem can be broken down into four categories: Russia's
cable warfare capabilities, the Russian navy's potential underwater
targets, potential effects from damage to submarine cables, and NATO's
publicly acknowledged efforts to respond to Russia. In this post, I
summarize existing information on each of these and then pose
outstanding questions about the potential Russian threat. My earlier
piece on Lawfare provides more background on submarine cables as well as
the international law protecting them. Russia's cable warfare
capabilities Moscow threatens undersea cables primarily with submarines
and spy ships that deploy deep-sea submersibles. At DefenseOne, a
national security news site from Atlantic Media, Magnus Nordenman
detailed how Russia has converted ballistic missile subs to deploy the
highly secretive AS-12 Losharik deep-sea submarine. The Losharik can
dive down thousands of meters, enabling it to target cables at depths
that would be very difficult to repair. The most prominent Russian spy
ship is the Yantar. Classified as an \"oceanographic research vessel,\"
the Yantar on its 2015 voyage probing a cable route to Cuba provoked
some of the first reporting that Russia was targeting cables. That trip
drew attention to the Yantar's capabilities for intelligence operations.
It carries advanced surveillance equipment, including a remotely
operated underwater vehicle and two manned submersibles that the BBC
reported can dive about 6,000 meters. For context, the average depth of
the ocean floor is about 3,700 meters. With all its advanced gear, the
Yantar has been busy since it came into service in 2015. The ship
deployed off a U.S. submarine base in Georgia in 2015, located the
wrecks of crashed Russian fighter jets in the eastern Mediterranean in
2016 and assisted in the search for a missing Argentine submarine in
2017. The Russian navy is scheduled to complete construction on a second
Yantar-class ship in 2019 and to begin building a third in 2020.
Underwater submersibles can damage cables. But it is not certain whether
they can tap cable communications underwater in the same way that human
operatives can tap fiber-optic cables on land. The BBC article about the
Yantar noted a Russian report that the ship has devices that can tap
undersea cables to obtain the data flowing through them. According to
the Register, a British technology news site, tapping fiber-optic cables
underwater requires opening up armoured sheaths, avoiding shocks from
the cable's power supply and then splicing open highly sensitive glass
fibers. Thousands of meters underwater this would be impossible for a
diver or clumsy submersible. The New York Times reported in 2005 that
the USS Jimmy Carter, a highly advanced submarine that was the only one
of its class built, had a capability to tap undersea cables. An
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers report speculated that
a 45-foot extension added to the Jimmy Carter provided this capability
by allowing engineers to bring the cable up into a floodable chamber to
install a tap. But it is unlikely that the USS Jimmy Carter routinely
taps cables since U.S. intelligence agencies can much more easily (and
lawfully) obtain cable data through taps at above-ground cable landing
stations. There are no reports of Russian subs with similar
capabilities. Submersibles would be too small to have the same kind of
chamber as the Jimmy Carter. Therefore, it is not at all certain if
Russia can credibly claim that the Yantar can tap cables. What is Russia
targeting? The Russian naval activity is probably not aimed solely at
commercial communications cables. Reports in 2015 about the Yantar's
voyage off the southeastern U.S. coast indicated that defense officials
suspected the spy ship was mapping underwater sensors and equipment used
by submarines at the Kings Bay, Ga., naval base. Other reports suggested
that Russian naval activity was targeting military-operated cables that
do not show up on normal maps. These systems would likely be highly
classified. The Pentagon has laid publicly acknowledged cables
connecting Miami to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay and is planning a
cable from Guantanamo to Puerto Rico. These cables are part of the
DODIN---the term for the Defense Department's communications networks.
The agency that manages the DODIN plans to build a communications cable
network in the Caribbean. But it is not clear if these are the only
cables that agency manages. In addition to cables, the Russian activity
may be directed at military underwater sensing equipment. The Integrated
Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS) is the Navy's name for the array of
fixed and mobile acoustic arrays that provide its primary means for
detecting submarines. It was a potent tool for tracking Soviet
submarines during the Cold War and only because of information provided
by a submarine officer turned Soviet spy. Earlier this year, an expert
on the Russian military recounted that during the 1970s, U.S.
intelligence concluded that a Russian submarine had cut off an
underwater hydrophone that was part of the predecessor to the IUSS.
Although the IUSS faded in importance after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, it remains in operation. With the dramatic increase in Russian
submarine activity in recent years, the system is newly relevant to the
U.S. and to NATO. Effects of a potential attack on undersea cables
Hundreds of cables criss-cross the oceans. They provide the connectivity
that allows Microsoft to keep major data centers in Ireland and to have
that data nearly instantly accessible to U.S. customers. Although each
undersea cable transmits huge quantities of data, the cable network has
significant redundancy capacity. Rupturing one cable can cause temporary
disruptions but does not cut off service. When a major cable to Vietnam
failed last year, customers in Ho Chi Minh City briefly lost
connectivity. Because internet routing protocols direct data around
points of failure, traffic flows adjust to the lost connection and send
data over other cables to the same endpoint. Wayward anchors and storms
regularly cause cable faults, about 200 a year; repair ships are readily
available to mend broken lines. Cutting the United States off from the
rest of the world would require severing a large number of cables: at
least 18 in the North Atlantic alone, according to Telegeography's cable
map, and many more connecting the U.S. to Latin America and Asia. Nicole
Starosielski, who wrote a book about vulnerabilities in these cable
networks, called concerns about widespread sabotage of cables
"overblown," saying such an attack is not likely. But experts emphasize
that an adversary could strategically disrupt international networks in
the event of conflict. Rick Ledgett, a former deputy director of the
National Security Agency, points out that severing a number of a cables
at deep ocean depths would cause a significant network disruption that
could hamper a U.S. military response in the opening hours of a major
war. Russia has used similar tactics in the past. According a 2016
Chatham House report, during the 2014 invasion of Crimea, Russian forces
seized the peninsula's main internet traffic exchange point, isolating
Crimea's internet from the rest of the world at a key moment in the
conflict. One of the main reasons the U.S. military cares so much about
protecting civilian-run internet cables is that the military uses them
too. According to a Harvard report on undersea cable vulnerabilities,
the Defense Information Systems Agency (the agency responsible for
defense networks) relies on commercial cables for 95 percent of
strategic communications. One of the main military uses for network
traffic is unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video footage. The same report
said that when three cables in the Mediterranean went out in 2008, daily
UAV flights from an air base in Iraq decreased from hundreds to tens.
[Only the commercial cable networks can provide the bandwidth for
transmission of drone footage from southwest Asia to the continental
U.S. The U.S. and NATO response [NATO officials have **not been
silent**]{.mark}. In December, the commander of NATO's submarine forces
said the Russian focus on submarine cables was unprecedented. A U.S.
commander in NATO commented that Russia's naval activity in and around
the North Atlantic was greater than Cold War levels. [At the meeting of
NATO's defense ministers]{.mark} in November, the alliance agreed to
revive its Atlantic command, which had been shuttered in
2002. [Leaders]{.mark} also [agreed to create a Cyber Operations Center
to integrate alliance members' cyber-capabilities into NATO
missions]{.mark}. Defense ministers will scheduled to decide on the
location, size and cost of the Atlantic command at their Feb. 18
meeting.]{.underline} That meeting was one of the last before the NATO
summit in Brussels in July, when alliance leaders will have to address
the thorny question of who pays for the expanded commands. Supporting
these efforts, in the U.S. defense authorization bill for fiscal 2018,
Congress authorized \$250 million for a new ship that can lay and repair
cables. [The U.S. has only one active cable ship, the USNS Zeus, built
in 1984. [But the U.S. Navy has **not** put]{.mark} forth [a plan for
defending]{.mark} submarine [cables. There is **no shortage of creative
ideas** for protecting cables]{.mark}. Last November, Rishi Sunak, a
British member of parliament, published a report about vulnerabilities
in undersea cables that discussed the Russian threat. It argued that
cables have insufficient protection in international law (again, see my
earlier piece for more on this topic).
Sunak's [recommendations]{.mark} for improving security of undersea
cables [included]{.mark}: Securing cable landing sites; Establishing
cable protection zones;]{.underline} Deploying monitoring equipment
along cable routes; Diversifying cable routes away from geographic choke
points; Building backup "dark cables" for redundant capacity;
Strengthening international law protecting cables; [and [Increasing NATO
naval exercises in preparation for an attack on undersea
cables]{.mark}.]{.underline} The creation of cable protection zones is
particularly interesting idea. Australia and New Zealand have proclaimed
protected zones over key cable routes where activities that pose a
risk---such as fishing, anchoring and dredging---are prohibited. Both
countries imposed harsh penalties for violating the zones, penalties
that the Federal Communications Commission concluded in a 2014 report
constituted a strong deterrent to potentially harmful activities near
cable routes. But it is not certain whether cable protection zones can
extend past states' territorial waters. The writers of the Tallinn
Manual 2.0 on international law applicable to cyber operations argued
that although states were perfectly within their rights to create cable
protection zones in their territorial sea, "there is no clear norm with
respect to either the \[exclusive economic zone\] or continental shelf,
and certainly not for the high seas." [The zones could protect cables in
states' coastal areas, but the deep-water routes that concern NATO would
still be an issue. [Neither NATO nor the U.S. has put any of these ideas
into practice, leaving unanswered]{.mark} the [question of what steps
they are taking to defend cables]{.mark}. Outstanding questions [A lot
remains unclear]{.mark} about the nature of the Russian threat to
undersea cables. Much of that information is classified military
intelligence. But [this is a matter of significant public
interest]{.mark}---citizens the world over depend on a functioning
global internet. For reporters, researchers or enterprising
congressional staffers, here are some questions whose [answers would
enhance public]{.mark} knowledge and [security]{.mark}: Do defense
officials believe a Russian attack on cables would be a threat to "our
way of life," as Britain's defense chief said in December?]{.underline}
Do Russian submarines or ships have a capability to tap underwater
fiber-optic cables? Is there contingency planning for major attacks on
cables in the event of a conflict? How does NATO estimate that such an
attack would affect internet access? Have defense officials discussed
the risks of a Russian attack with the commercial consortiums that own
and operate most undersea communications cables? What is the state of
underwater sensing equipment that could detect tampering with cables,
and how can such equipment be upgraded? What kinds of anti-submarine or
other defense capabilities does NATO believe are needed to deter Russia
from attacking cables? Would enhanced international legal protections
make an attack on cables less likely? If so, what forums would be
appropriate for developing such protections? What kinds of capabilities
would be necessary to quickly repair cable faults in the deep ocean and
would they be readily available in the event of conflict? Defense
officials may not have all the answers, nor want to disclose those they
do have. But the lack of information about Russian activities regarding
this vital part of the internet is troubling.

#### NATO [agrees]{.underline} to multilateral initiatives that [increase]{.underline} resilience of [undersea]{.underline} cables in the Arctic.

Conclusion

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the EU, their member states, and the
private sector [[are **developing** important]{.underline}]{.mark}
national, bilateral, minilateral, and [[**multilateral initiatives** to
increase]{.mark} the [**resilience** of CUI]{.mark} and protect
assets]{.underline}. These initiatives include upgrading capabilities,
sharing information, streamlining processes, and holding joint naval and
air maneuvers. But [[**more** needs to be done]{.underline}.
[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and individual allies [also [need to
develop]{.mark} their [capacity to **respond**]{.mark} to [and
**attribute** incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}, and enhance deterrence
against hybrid threats, including those [[in the **undersea
domain**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Continuing incidents, backed by **Russia** and the **PRC**,]{.mark}
that [undermine **alliance deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
implicitly move the goal posts of acceptable behavior also demonstrate
that past responses have been insufficient. NATO policy holds that an
attack against critical infrastructure may result in an Article 5
response. Reactions to incidents that fall short of this may be deemed
as weak by adversaries testing the boundaries of tacitly accepted
behavior, thereby undermining deterrence. With this in mind, [[NATO must
**enhance** its ability to]{.mark} attribute and [**condemn**
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alliance members should also consider
expanding NATO response options and enhance SACEUR's authority to
quickly respond to threats against CUI. This could include a stronger
and better resourced maritime readiness force following the model of the
VJTF. NATO should also help its members coordinate announcements on
actions allies may take in response to incidents in their EEZs. [[Such
actions include the **right** to board a vessel **suspected** of
damaging **undersea cables**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[In the **Arctic**]{.mark}, where [NATO allies' **posture**]{.mark} and
capabilities [are more **limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}, more [concerted
[efforts to **enhance**]{.mark} situational [awareness will be
of]{.mark} **[utmost importance]{.mark}** and will serve as the basis
for detecting and denying threats]{.underline}, and for holding
potential aggressors accountable. NATO's Arctic allies should closely
monitor undersea infrastructure that is especially vulnerable due to its
location, its strategic value, its complicated ownership structure, and
its political and symbolic value. [[**Russian** and **PRC** naval
maneuvers]{.mark} should [trigger an **increased**]{.mark} NATO
[presence]{.mark}]{.underline} to protect and defend nearby assets
during and after exercises.

#### NATO will [says yes]{.underline} to protection of [critical]{.underline} undersea infrastructure.

NATO's [**[C]{.mark}**ritical **[U]{.mark}**ndersea
**[I]{.mark}**nfrastructure **[N]{.mark}**etwork met]{.underline} in
Karlskrona, Sweden, on Monday and Tuesday (26-27 May 2025), [[bringing
together]{.underline}]{.mark} civilian and military
**[[authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, industry partners, and experts
from [[across the Alliance to **deepen** cooperation in protecting
**cables**]{.mark} and pipelines [that **underpin** global
connectivity]{.mark} and energy security]{.underline}.

[[The meeting **focused** on]{.underline}]{.mark} enhancing situational
awareness, strengthening preparedness, and reinforcing collective
responses through improved information sharing and coordination.
Participants discussed [[**innovative approaches** to detecting
**suspicious** activities]{.mark} and securing vital undersea
assets]{.underline}, including through new sensing and monitoring
technologies.

"[[**Sharing** information across]{.mark} public-private and
civilian-military [**sectors** is]{.mark} not just beneficial, it's
**[essential]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said Ambassador Jean-Charles
Ellermann-Kingombe, NATO Assistant Secretary General for Innovation,
Hybrid and Cyber. "[[**Enhancing** our ability to]{.mark} deter,
**[detect and respond]{.mark}** to threats [requires a **collective
effort**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We'll continue our work together to do
just that."
