# Aff -- Benefit Sharing - DGHL

### Notes

Thank you to Ava, Max, Ishaan, Darin, Niko, Victoria, Lucy, and Austin
for their work on this file.

Benefit sharing is when corporations cooperate with Native Alaskans when
doing mineral extraction on their land.

Status quo benefit sharing operates under 3 regimes:

a)  Paternalistic: Companies operate and own the land while providing
    for Native Alaskans. Native Alaskans get a lump sum dividend.

b)  Company-driven model where corporations voluntarily offer benefits
    (e.g., jobs, revenue-sharing, social investments) to communities in
    exchange for project approval or goodwill.

c)  Co-Management: Native Alaskans co-manage and co-design the facility.

The AFF mandates new mineral resource extraction under the third model.
The BLM does the plan in cooperation with the BIA and the US Geological
Survey.

5\. Discussion: Considering Advantages and Disadvantages of Benefit
Sharing Regimes

This paper developed the typology of various [benefit sharing regimes
[in]{.mark} the Arctic]{.underline} and illustrated them with
[**examples** from Russia, **[Alaska]{.mark}**, and Canada.]{.underline}
In the cases of the NAO, YNAO, and KMAO regions of Russia we see
path-dependent practices of benefit sharing at the regional level vested
in the principles of social infrastructure investment, compensation, and
charity and implemented through a largely paternalistic mode
\[3,16,17\]. [In all these regions, the [most **common
practice**]{.mark} [is]{.mark} to conduct socio-economic
[agreements]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [companies]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
regional governor. [Regional authorities]{.mark}, with **little input**
from indigenous and local communities, [act as]{.mark} the **[main
actors]{.mark}** in decision-making in respect to social investment and
industrial activity,]{.underline} thus reproducing Soviet and
post-Soviet paternalistic experiences \[17,30,34\].
[**[Indigenous]{.mark}** and local **peoples [participation]{.mark}** in
the decision-making processes **[is minimal]{.mark}**. Therefore, the
benefit sharing regime at the regional level is characterized by
insufficient procedural and distributive equities]{.underline} \[5\],
[strong path-dependency, extractivism and overreliance on semi-formal
and trickle-down mechanisms.]{.underline}

If we look at the local scale and direct interactions between companies
and indigenous peoples in the Russian Arctic, we observe a continuum of
regimes that span from strictly paternalistic to CCSR mode-based
arrangements. It is important to point out that benefit sharing regimes
differ considerably among Russian territories. YNAO represents an
example of a regime where local agreements are setup via the regional
and local governments, and no separate agreements with indigenous
communities are negotiated, except for state-owned reindeer herding
enterprises. In NAO we observed a move towards CCSR due to the switch to
the new federal methodology for calculating the compensation for damage,
which partly substituted socio-economic agreements between companies and
indigenous peoples. The new arrangement gave more leverage, funds and
spending freedom to reindeer herders. However, we concur with the
literature \[17,29\] that in Russia, CCSR-based benefit sharing regimes
echo the Soviet experiences. They are characterized by the companies'
paternalistic attitudes towards the indigenous communities and desire to
retain the decision-making power in respect to benefits. This is often
done by applying the charity principle to benefit distribution and
reliance on semi-formal arrangements, in which communities are typically
at the mercy of an extractive company. Direct benefit sharing
arrangements between companies and indigenous peoples in NAO and KMAO
are determined by the regional legislation. In NAO companies are obliged
to compensate for expropriated and/or damaged agricultural land leased
by reindeer herding enterprises. In KMAO, companies are required to
compensate for building infrastructure and damaging the TTNU lands.

[Benefit sharing regimes]{.underline} based on both paternalism and CCSR
[are characterized by the **limited involvement** of indigenous peoples
in decision-making processes. During the construction phase of large oil
infrastructure,]{.underline} public hearings and [**[environmental
impact assessment]{.mark}** proceedings [are organized]{.mark} in larger
settlements [with **limited participation** of nomadic]{.mark} reindeer
[herders]{.mark}.]{.underline} The main decisions on social investments
are made via semi-formal negotiations between the company and the
authorities. Money is allocated for building social infrastructure,
purchasing goods and providing transport for indigenous peoples.
[[Indigenous]{.mark} peoples own [initiatives receive **little
attention**]{.mark}. There are no mechanisms developed for monitoring
public opinion and requests from the indigenous and other local
residents.]{.underline}

In contrast, the benefit sharing regime in Sakhalin is guided by the
corporate policies of the international consortia conducting the oil
extraction, as well as by the standards of international financial
institutions. Both Sakhalin Energy and Exxon Neftegaz Limited
strategically involve the state actors in the tripartite partnerships in
order to avoid state pressure to force these companies to fill gaps in
the state budget and public services (which happens with the state-owned
extractive companies, such as Rosneft) \[37\]. In the case of Sakhalin,
the transnational actors brought in the international standards that are
reflected in benefit sharing arrangements. The peculiar feature of the
tripartite model is that the companies readily involve indigenous people
in making decisions about their own development. Sakhalin Energy is
granting indigenous representatives the power to allocate and distribute
funds without assistance from the company or the state. Both companies
enabled a procedure of filing complaints to the company. The information
about the results of grant competitions, the amount of money granted and
the beneficiaries are fully disclosed to the community. Social
investment involves supporting and promoting local initiatives \[3\].

Successful benefit-sharing practices can help companies to ensure a
long-term SLO and can enhance sustainability in resource-dependent
communities \[14,33,34\]. However, [the practices of interactions with
stakeholders differ in the investigated case studies.]{.underline} In
NAO and KMAO we observed the shift from arrangements based on the
financial aid (charity) principle to the compensation principle of
benefit sharing with the growing role of CCSR. [[This kind of
**benefit-sharing**]{.mark} may [enhance]{.mark} [corporate
efficiency]{.mark} for the **short-term**, [but does not]{.mark}
guarantee long-term SLO and does not [eliminate **risks of
conflicts**]{.mark}, especially in cases when compensations are small
and/or are not calculated properly.]{.underline} However, this does not
mean that the tripartite partnership model in Sakhalin is unequivocally
better for effective benefit-sharing among indigenous communities. The
partnership mode assumes that the communities are ready to comply with
the transparent rules, as well as the companies themselves. This also
assumes that the community is able to take responsibility for its
decisions. This, however, is not always true. For instance, in the case
of Sakhalin, the company delegated power to indigenous representatives
to distribute grants between households, which in turn entailed
conflicts. In the partnership mode, local initiatives and
entrepreneurship workshops are prioritized, however, not all training
programs prove to be efficient. In a variety of cases, investing
corporate funds by Russian companies in the construction of communities'
facilities turns out to be a more important instrument of social
investment \[34\].

The Alaskan and Canadian Arctic benefit sharing regimes differ
considerably from one another and from Russia. This can be explained by
differences in land ownership, as well as by diverging political and
economic contexts. In Russia the land belongs to the state and land with
mineral deposits is leased to the extractive companies. Benefits from
lease sales go to the state. In both Alaska and Canada, a significant
sum of money comes to indigenous communities via royalty payments. In
Russia when companies encroach upon land (TTNU or agricultural) leased
by indigenous reindeer herders, these companies pay (relatively minimal)
compensation for the loss of pastures. In Alaska in the framework of
ANCSA, and in Canada in the framework of CLCAs, land is owned by
indigenous peoples and a significant amount of royalties are paid to
indigenous communities when oil companies use the land. These royalty
payments are much greater than compensations in Russia. In both Alaska
and Canada, a significant effort was made to invest in indigenous
communities and build capacities by creating indigenous-run businesses.
Such benefit sharing mechanisms have largely not emerged in Russia. In
Alaska, Native corporations, are involved in oil drilling themselves,
and in Canada regional corporations invest and maintain a variety of
businesses. [In both **Alaska** and Canada,]{.underline} however, [there
are often [**tensions** between]{.mark} indigenous [traditional
activities]{.mark} and non-traditional businesses involvement
[with]{.mark} potentially [negative impacts]{.mark} of the expanding
wage economy [on traditional practices and cultural
vitality]{.mark}]{.underline} \[48,49\].

[Benefit sharing regimes based on the shareholder mode in
Alaska]{.underline} and beneficiary mode in Canada are relatively unique
for the Arctic and may present considerable interest to other world
regions, although they do [have]{.underline} their strengths and
**[weaknesses]{.underline}**. Conceptually, [each regime has
**characteristics** that support increasing the wealth of both
**individuals** and **communities**]{.underline}. In both cases the
indigenous peoples are empowered to make decisions on distribution of
benefits, however, [some of these [decisions]{.mark} may [fail to foster
sustainability]{.mark} in local communities.]{.underline} At the same
time, [in the North Slope of Alaska village [corporations create
**intergenerational** **inequalities**]{.mark} by denying the
"afterborns'" shares]{.underline} and in Canada the distribution of
payments to individuals may elevate alcohol and drug abuse and disrupt
social services.

#### Current Alaskan Native benefit sharing agreements are varied and ineffective in addressing needs of Indigenous peoples.

6\. Discussion and Conclusions

[The Alaska North Slope benefit-sharing regime is constituted
by]{.underline} principles, involving investment,
**[compensation]{.underline}**, and charity \[**21**\]. Different actors
implement these principles in practice. For example, the North Slope
Borough and native corporations are heavily involved in the investment.
The RMS involves fully compensatory money. Oil companies are involved
both in investments and charitable contributions. [In **Alaska**,
**all** paternalistic, CCSR, and partnership modes are
observed]{.underline}, in which the shareholder mode is dominant and
unique.

[Mechanisms of benefit-sharing arrangements **depend** on land
ownership]{.underline} (royalty payments), [existing legal,
institutional, and cultural environments]{.underline}, [as well as on
the company that operates in the area]{.underline}, such as
transnational corporations, native regional or native village
corporations.

Legislation, contracts and/or regulation requires mandated mechanisms.
[Under]{.underline} the [**paternalistic** mode,]{.underline} they
involve the distribution of taxes that companies pay to the NSB and
[royalties paid to the state.]{.underline} [Under]{.underline} the
[**CCSR** mode]{.underline}, they are [represented by community
investment funds]{.underline} and foundations, in our case, on the North
Slope Foundation, [created by native corporations]{.underline} that
serve for channeling money from oil companies. [In]{.underline} a
[partnership mode]{.underline} [by fixed contracts]{.underline} [between
transnational oil companies and native corporations]{.underline}, these
contractual relationships simultaneously contribute to the shareholder
mode as money earned via contracts is distributed to shareholders. In
the shareholder mode, ANCSA legislation requires mandated sharing.

[Negotiated **benefits** **represent** a **large group** which can be
different under different modes]{.underline}. For example[,
**benefit-sharing** arrangements]{.underline} that were [negotiated as
part of]{.underline} the [regional mitigation strategy]{.underline},
belong to the paternalistic mode, but [were highly participatory, yet
organized in a **top--down** way]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} the
[CCSR mode, negotiated benefits are limited to company
policies]{.underline} and royalties paid in the framework of land use
agreements. Therefore, [**both** participatory and distributed equity
are **limited**]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} the [**partnership**
mode, benefit-sharing arrangements involve
**co-management**]{.underline} [and coordination between industrial
activities and subsistence or cultural activities]{.underline}, which
includes the flexibility of industrial activities depending on wildlife
migrations or events important for indigenous hunting. In case the
company employs Indigenous Peoples, their work schedules can be flexible
to accommodate their subsistence hunting activities.

[Semi-formal benefits involve]{.underline} [different]{.underline} kinds
of [goods]{.underline} and services [that communities get upon
request]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the [NSB, transnational oil
companies, or native corporations]{.underline}. We call this an "ask and
get" system. Sponsorship that the local community requests also belongs
to this category. Trickle-down benefits involve those coming from
industrial development as such, including employment, infrastructure the
company builds for its own operation and used by communities, increased
cash flow, local economic growth, and income growth.

Principles, modes, and mechanisms together provide a systematic
framework for analyzing benefit-sharing regime in Alaska \[**21**\]. To
understand how and to what extent benefit-sharing arrangements are
equitable in terms of participatory and distributive equity, we looked
at principles, modes, and mechanisms of delivery of monetary and
non-monetary support by particular actors (see **Table 1**).

[All state actors,]{.underline} BLM, the state of Alaska, and the NSB
(partners with ASRC) [engage in **paternalistic** relationships with
local communities]{.underline}, [which is not in line with the new
public management mode]{.underline}, [which calls for abandoning the
**top--down** approach to service delivery]{.underline} \[**61**\].
[**Participatory equity** is **low** under the paternalistic
mode]{.underline}, despite distributive equity being high as communities
justly receive large sums of money. As a result, [communities became
totally dependent on **oil money**]{.underline}, and created and
maintained a specific category of paternalism---oil paternalism.

#### Companies only engage in enough benefit-sharing agreements necessary to operate in indigenous lands

**Alubankudi 21**, \* Master's in Polar Law at the University of
Akureyri. (Thelma Sefakor Alubankudi, 06-01-2021, \"Sustainable
Development of Arctic Oil and Gas: Indigenous Peoples' Rights and
Benefit-Sharing.\", Icelandic E-Journal of Nordic & Mediterranean

//ishi

Benefit-sharing can be described as a fair and equal distribution of the
monetary and non- monetary benefits produced by resource extraction
activities. Rewards include the allocation of taxes and royalties,
business, and equity ownership, employment creation, negotiated
arrangements, and community development (Wilson, 2019). Globally,
benefit-sharing offers mean that indigenous/local populations and
extractive industries cooperate peacefully to turn the resource "curse"
into a developmental advantage (Petrov & Tysiachniouk, 2019). [In remote
areas in the Arctic, oil and natural gas production offers growth
opportunities and also raises costs for residents, indigenous
communities, and cultures.]{.underline} It affects the economy's
survival and reduces the traditional resource utilization of land
(Tysiachniouk & Petrov, 2018). Benefit-sharing is a legal requirement
and a component of corporate social responsibility that can promote
sustainable development in the remote Arctic regions if adequately
structured. [In the Arctic, sustainable development can be defined as
development that enhances the well-being, health, and protection of
Arctic populations and inhabitants, while maintaining the institutions,
roles, and resources of ecosystems (Petrov & Tysiachniouk,
2019).]{.underline} On the other hand, Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) is a management principle in which organizations combine fiscal,
social, and environmental issues in their business practices and the
relationship with their stakeholder ("What Is CSR? \| UNIDO," n.d.).

[Sometimes, companies engage in corporate social responsibility
benefit-sharing schemes to satisfy investors and shareholders and to
meet the needs of local communities only to the degree required to
receive the 'social license' to operate (Tysiachniouk & Petrov,
2018).]{.underline} The commitment of an organization to localities
often takes the form of compensation or targeted investments. However,
the corporation holds the leadership role in the decision-making power
of benefit sharing, making its preference prevail in several ways over
community needs and desires (Petrov & Tysiachniouk, 2019).

Therefore, [a fragile Arctic environment is of concern because of the
adverse consequences of extractive practices, which are now turned into
industrial **"green movements," resulting in the invasion of indigenous
lands** (Wilson, 2020) and causes danger to their ways of life, such as
herding, fishing, and farming.]{.underline} The focus on indigenous
rights is on FPIC principles. FPIC may take many forms but is an
important sustainable development corporate governance framework. It is
a right set out for Indigenous peoples in international treaties and
declarations, especially ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples and some national legislation (Buxton & Wilson, 2013).

Therefore, the absence of Indigenous peoples' representation in policy
decisions on creating the extractive sector in their territories,
including decisions on the allocation of land for extractive industry
operations and the awarding of exploration licenses, threatens the
possibilities for fair development results. [It is advised that there
should be an informed decision to monitor the benefit-sharing scheme,
and total community control of benefit-sharing and management must exist
to eliminate any controversy. As a result, companies and the state must
collaborate with indigenous and other impacted populations to develop
local institutional capacity and human resources as part of
benefit-sharing obligations.]{.underline} This will ensure that the
policies that share benefits are transparent, sensitive, empowering, and
lead in a just and equitable way to Arctic populations' sustainable
development. Thus, corporate social responsibility and Triple Bottom
Line initiatives should be monitored and enforced in every Arctic
state's soft laws. Every mining and oil industry player operating in the
Arctic must report companies' financial, social, and environmental
performance over time by protecting businesses amid future uncertainty.

#### Oil spills are [widespread]{.underline} and will [only get worse]{.underline}.

[Alaska Native rights and]{.underline} Indigenous [sovereignty **cannot
be separated from**]{.underline} the problem of extreme **[oil and gas
production in Alaska]{.underline}**. Politicians and oil interests have
a long history of pushing legislation nullifying Alaska Native land
claims, especially those claims that stood in the way of oil and
pipeline development.

After being declared a state in 1958, [Alaska selected]{.underline} for
oil development tracts of [land on the North Slope]{.underline}, in an
area called Prudhoe Bay.1 [Without consultation]{.underline} and consent
of the local Inupiat village, but with approval of the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management, these [lands were transferred to the
state]{.underline}.2

In 1964, the state leased some of these tracts to oil companies and in
1968, oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay.3 [The oil boom **forever
altered the ecosystem**]{.underline} and the life of the Inupiat people,
including [by contributing to climate change through the release of
carbon]{.underline} from oil sent from the North Slope to refineries.
This all led to the building of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline
across the state that further trampled over the rights of Inupiat
peoples and Alaska Native land rights at large.4

The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was passed in 1971, over
opposition from the Inupiat.5 ANCSA took land from jurisdictional
control of Alaska Natives, allowing the petroleum industry and State of
Alaska to gain access to oil reserves.6

[Native Alaskans are]{.underline} once again [confronted with **oil and
gas expansion**]{.underline} under the Trump administration, [with
potential]{.underline} oil [drilling in the]{.underline} Alaska Outer
Continental Shelf ([OCS]{.underline}) [and opening]{.underline} of
[the]{.underline} Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ([ANWR]{.underline})
[to]{.underline} oil and gas [development]{.underline}.7

In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order lifting a ban on oil
exploration in the coastal seas of Alaska. [The U.S. government
is]{.underline} now [proposing]{.underline} 19 [offshore lease
sales]{.underline} in the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, and
other areas.8 [**Any oil spills** in]{.underline} these [Arctic waters
would be **catastrophic**]{.underline} for bowhead whales, seals, polar
bears and other marine mammals, [and]{.underline} would [directly affect
the Alaska Natives' **subsistence culture and way of
life**]{.underline}.9 [Spills or drilling disasters]{.underline} would
[mean high-risk cleanup challenged by ice cover, subzero temperatures,
and harsh weather conditions]{.underline}. There is no proven way to
clean sea ice of oil from potential spills.10

The U.S. Republican tax overhaul law passed in December 2017 included a
provision requiring two oil and gas lease sales in the coastal plains
area of the ANWR over the next 10 years.11

ANWR is one of the world's most pristine and beautiful ecosystems, with
landscapes and wildlife that demand the strongest protection. The Refuge
is home to porcupine caribou, muskoxen, moose, Arctic fox, lynx, wolves,
and polar bears, brown bears and black bears, and is a stopping point
for nearly 200 species of migratory birds.12

For Alaska Natives, such as the Gwich'in Athabascan peoples, protecting
the Refuge and the caribou they depend on is a matter of human rights
and the collective right of Indigenous peoples -- as well as a critical
matter of survival.13 [In opposing Arctic oil drilling, they are
fighting for their rights]{.underline} and the rights of the porcupine
caribou, whose calving grounds are within the coastal plain of the
Refuge. The Gwich'in call these caribou calving grounds Iizhik Gwats'an
Gwnadaii Goodlit: "the sacred place where life begins." The Gwich'in
have followed the caribou herd across the lands of this protected Refuge
for thousands of years.14 They are rightfully concerned that seismic
exploration and drilling for oil in the Refuge will have disastrous
effects on the delicate web of life in these sacred lands. Oil and gas
expansion in ANWR would carve up the Refuge with roads and industrial
infrastructure, fragmenting otherwise pristine habitat and exposing the
fragile tundra and wildlife to toxic chemicals, oil spills, and gas
leaks.15

[Alaska Native Peoples and the fragile Arctic ecosystem have yet to
fully recover from]{.underline} the disastrous 1989 [Exxon
Valdez]{.underline} terminal oil spill. [It killed thousands of animals,
severely affecting the]{.underline} local [food chain, as well as the
food security and sovereignty of Alaska Natives]{.underline}.16 [Another
spill would have a **catastrophic effect** on]{.underline} what remains
of [Alaska's pristine ecosystem and the way of life of its
peoples]{.underline}.17

Moreover, expansion of [oil and gas]{.underline} development in Alaska
[will]{.underline} lead to an [increase]{.underline} in global
[greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is already a stark
reality]{.underline} in the Alaska Arctic ecosystem. The average air
temperature in the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global
average.18 Coastal villages are experiencing the melting of permafrost,
which in turn triggers huge seasonal surges in CO2 emissions and coastal
erosion.19 Ice cover in the coastal waters is decreasing, making it more
difficult to obtain the seafood that sustains local Indigenous
peoples.20 Inland, porcupine caribou migration routes are changing,
threatening Gwich'in hunters that rely on the caribou.21

Expansion of [oil and gas development in Alaska is an **assault against
the Alaska Natives** who are defending the territorial integrity of
Mother Earth and Father Sky]{.underline}, and the rights of their future
generations. Bank [financing]{.underline} of the expansion of [extreme
fossil fuels in Alaska perpetuates a long history of violations of the
human rights and collective rights of the Indigenous peoples of
Alaska]{.underline}.

2\. Impacts of oil spill on Arctic and Subarctic wildlife and human

[Spilled oil in Arctic or Subarctic waters does not remain stationary
but is carried by wind and currents]{.underline} (horizontally and
vertically), [often covering considerably large areas]{.underline}. [Oil
will likely reach shoreline regions or become trapped within sea ice,
affecting coastal wildlife and local communities (Fig. 2), which are
highly dependent on the sustenance and habitat of a healthy
ocean.]{.underline}

Fig. 2

Fig. 2. Impacts of spilled oil on wildlife and human in coastal regions
of Arctic and Subarctic areas.

2.1. Invertebrates

[Copepods of the genus Calanus, the key invertebrates in Arctic areas,
are the primary herbivores of marine ecosystems.]{.underline} Calanus
glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus have been widely studied regarding
their response to exposure to oil and its compounds (e.g., polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)), as well as related chemical substances
(e.g., surface washing agents and dispersants). [Some findings suggest a
significant risk of oil component accumulation in Arctic copepods due to
their high lipid content (exceeding 50 % of dry weight) and their
limited ability to metabolize them]{.underline} (Øverjordet et al.,
2018). Acute toxicity data, such as the lethal concentration 50 (LC50),
were obtained from temperate, boreal, and Arctic species through
toxicity studies (Jager et al., 2017), indicating that Arctic species
are less sensitive when exposed to water-accommodated fractions (WAF) of
oil, probably due to lipid content and low temperature. [Sublethal
effects of oil were also studied through the investigation of
physiological indicators of these species, including fecal pellet
production, egg production, hatching rate and success, naupliar
development and length, and deformity (Hjorth and Nielsen, 2011; Jensen
and Carroll, 2010). Spilled oil has varying degrees of negative effects
on physiological performance, which may affect the overall health,
population dynamics, and survival and reproduction rates of exposed
species.]{.underline} In situ burning can be conducted to reduce the
potential effects of spilled oil. This was found to significantly
decrease the PAH exposure to Calanus hyperboreus, thus mitigating the
possible side effects on such species (Fritt-Rasmussen et al., 2024).

Research on the effects of spilled oil on Arctic and Subarctic
invertebrates is limited and has mainly focused on crustaceans and
molluscs. [The Arctic scallop Chlamys islandica widely inhabits Arctic
and Subarctic waters and shows promise as a sentinel organism for
environmental monitoring]{.underline} (Nahrgang et al., 2013). [Acute
oil exposure]{.underline} (e.g., WAF of North Sea crude oil with maximum
ΣPAH 163 μg/L for up to 21 days, dispersed Ekofisk crude oil at 0.06 and
0.25 mg/L for up to 15 days, and marine diesel with 29 ppm for 7 days)
[can affect scallop\'s immune function and oxidative stress status,
resulting in mortalities, phagocytosis and cell membrane stability
impairment, glutathione decrease, and other biological
effects]{.underline} (Hannam et al., 2010; Milinkovitch et al., 2015).
Similarly, [oil, chemically dispersed oil, and dispersant solution
treatments]{.underline} (five treatments of Alaska North Slope crude oil
and Corexit 9500 for up to 21 days: 10 ppm oil, 1 ppm dispersant, and 10
ppm oil with 2, 1, or 0.5 ppm dispersant) [exhibited acute and chronic
effects on the mussel Mytilus trossulus, showing genetic damage, tissue
loss, and a continued stress response; non-dispersed oil also suppressed
immune activity and caused higher mortality of exposed
mussels]{.underline} (Counihan, 2018). The effects of spilled oil on
invertebrates depend on exposure conditions, such as oil type,
concentration, and exposure duration. Consequently, the relevant static
laboratory results do not necessarily reflect the effects in the field
due to significantly different exposure regimes. However, mesocosm
studies and field observations, though limited, can be combined with
laboratory experiments to improve understanding of the ecological risks
of oil and to develop more effective management strategies in cold
regions.

2.2. Fish

[Polar cod]{.underline} (Boreogadus saida) [is highly abundant in the
Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, and its geographical distribution may
overlap regions for petroleum activities with a high likelihood of oil
exposure. It serves as a monitoring species for the evaluation of the
impacts of spilled oil, and most examined biomarkers (e.g., enzyme
activity, metabolites, and gene and DNA damage) exhibit significant
responses to both waterborne exposure and dietary exposure associated
with petroleum-related substances]{.underline} (Nahrgang et al., 2010;
Vieweg et al., 2017).

[Due to the buoyancy of polar cod eggs, enhanced oil exposure to the
chorion]{.underline} (an acellular envelope surrounding the oocyte) [of
fish embryos, induces a decline in hatching success, disruption of heart
function, and abnormalities within larvae]{.underline} (Laurel et al.,
2019; Nahrgang et al., 2016). In early life stages, [normal polar cod
larvae development was considerably reduced, and the frequency and
severity of developmental abnormalities increased with increasing crude
oil]{.underline} (Kobbe crude) [exposure]{.underline} levels from 0.5 to
6 g oil per kg gravel (Nahrgang et al., 2016). Gardiner et al. (2013)
also studied the acute toxicity of 3 WAF of Alaska North Slope crude oil
with/without breaking wave and dispersant on the juvenile polar cod and
larval sculpin (Myoxocephalus sp.). They determined their median lethal
concentration ranges (1.6--4.0 mg/L for WAF and breaking wave WAF
treatments and 22--62 mg/L for chemically enhanced WAF treatment). The
synergistic adverse effects of oil exposure and warming on the embryos
and larvae of polar and Atlantic cod have also been reported by Bender
et al. (2021).

For adult polar cod, the growth rate was temporarily depressed when
treated with mechanically and chemically (dispersant FINASOL®) dispersed
Goliat (Kobbe) crude oil at 5 % w/w for 48 h; however, the overall
growth and survival were not affected in the long-term (Bender et al.,
2018). The mitochondrial metabolism of adult polar cod was also
investigated, and the results showed that crude Arabian light at 95 mg/L
for up to 48 h inhibited the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory
chain (Dussauze et al., 2014). In the sensitive life stage (e.g.
spawning period) of adults, polar cod females exposed to Barents sea
Goliat crude oil at 24 g oil per kg gravel were more inclined to spawn,
exhibited altered hepatic gene expression, and yielded eggs with
increased PAH body burden than their counterparts in the control group
(Strople et al., 2023). Exposure to in-situ burn oil residues
(approximately 4 L burned residue of fresh Kobbe crude oil in 200 L of
seawater for 48 h) induced fewer females to spawn but had no long-term
effects on male reproductive development (Bender et al., 2018). It can
be seen that the effects of oil exposure on Arctic fish can be
influenced by oil type and concentration, level of dispersion, exposure
route, life stage, sex, and the influence of response strategies (e.g.,
application of oil dispersants and in-situ burning).

2.3. Birds

[Seabirds are among the most vulnerable animal groups during oil spill
events, mostly because oil spills on the sea surface readily adhere to
their feathers, thereby changing their hydrophobic properties. This
results in a loss of insulation, waterproofing, and buoyancy, leading to
subsequent hypothermia, starvation, or drowning to death, which are
exacerbated in cold Arctic and Subarctic areas]{.underline}
(Fritt-Rasmussen et al., 2016). Meanwhile, oil residues from in situ
burning also showed comparable or potentially more harmful impacts on
seabird feathers, whose microstructure damage was detected even in cases
of thin, imperceptible sheens (Fritt-Rasmussen et al., 2016). [Some
seabirds, such as Pigeon Guillemots, also use nearshore habitats for
breeding and roosting on shorelines where oil contamination is likely to
occur]{.underline} (Helm et al., 2014a). [When the spilled oil reaches
the coastal areas, shorebirds are threatened by oil adhesion to their
feathers, ingestion by preening oil from contaminated feathers,
consumption of oiled prey, and disturbance from shoreline cleanup
operations]{.underline} (Ma et al., 2022).

Following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, an extensive research program
was initiated to document the effects of oil spills on birds in Arctic
and Subarctic regions. Piatt et al. (1990) estimated the mortality of
100,000--300,000 birds using aerial and ship-based surveys and
extrapolated data on the number of deceased birds collected. In addition
to immediate impact, the analysis of bird abundance and distribution
implied the effects of oil were most apparent in the year of spill
occurred with Pigeon Guillemots particularly affected, while recovery
indications were observed for all bird species initially impacted by
oiling after two years (Murphy et al., 1997). However, the adverse
effects continued for some bird species such as harlequin duck, Pigeon
Guillemot, and murres even nine years after the spill (Irons et al.,
2000), whereas they persisted for less than 2.5 years for most of the
affected bird species (Day et al., 1997). Ten years after the incident,
[the continuous exposure to oil residues, through wider dietary breadth
such as fishes and invertebrates and inhabiting nearshore with oil
pollution, can cause the possible liver damage in adult Pigeon
Guillemots]{.underline} (increased aspartate aminotransferase and
lactate dehydrogenase activities were observed in the oiled region
relative to unoiled region) [and reduce survival rate to restrict the
population recovery]{.underline} (Golet et al., 2002); similar findings
on other indicators (e.g., blood parameters) and species (e.g.,
harlequin ducks and Barrow\'s goldeneyes) have also been reported
(Seiser et al., 2000; Trust et al., 2000). After 11--14 years, the
cumulative winter survival rates of hatch-year female harlequin ducks
were 0.766 and 0.758 for the control and oiled regions, respectively,
indicating that the direct impacts of oil pollution on the demography of
this species were substantially diminished (Esler and Iverson, 2010). In
addition to occasional large spills, chronic oil pollution\'s effects on
marine birds in cold regions, such as illegal dumping and oil seeps,
have also been studied (Text S1).

2.4. Mammals

[Iconic marine mammals observed within Arctic and Subarctic coastal
areas include whales, seals, and polar bears. Spilled oil can affect
these mammals through direct exposure routes, including ingestion,
inhalation, and dermal contact]{.underline} (O\'Hara and Becker, 2002).
Furthermore, [indirect effects on these mammals may be significant due
to the reduction in prey, habitat alteration, behavioral pattern
changes, and reproduction impairment]{.underline} (Helm et al., 2014b).
Cetaceans (e.g., whales) frequently observed in shallow coastal waters
have respiratory intervals from minutes to over 1 h; [inhaling oil
volatile components at the air/water interface is the primary immediate
threat in oil spill incidents, which might cause lung issues, liver
damage, neurological disorders, and even death]{.underline} (Helm et
al., 2014b). The killer whale Orcinus orca population was evaluated
using photo identification before and after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil
spill. The resident and transient populations experienced losses of 33
and 41 %, respectively, and neither of them returned to their pre-spill
population levels even 16 years after the disaster (Matkin et al.,
2008).

[As pinnipeds, seals are extensively distributed along Arctic marine
coastlines and are easily exposed to spilled oil on land and water. They
mainly rely on blubber rather than fur for insulation]{.underline}
(Liwanag et al., 2012); [therefore, oil adhesion on seals may not
significantly impair regulating body temperature but might result in
their inability to swim and cause drowning]{.underline} (Aubin, 1988).
Stimmelmayr et al. (2018) investigated and analyzed the pathological
indicators on three oiled ringed and spotted seals (Phoca hispida and
Phoca largha) and found increased PAH concentrations in oiled seal
tissues compared with those in unoiled counterparts. Nevertheless, the
corresponding PAH levels were relatively low (below 50 ng/g in wet
weight irrespective of oiling status), which might be attributed to the
rapid metabolism and elimination of PAHs previously observed in
vertebrates. [Cardiac lesions, liver issues, gastric ulcers/erosions
were also discovered in oiled seals. In earlier years, six ringed seals
exposed to crude oil for 24 h in the field experiment were observed with
eye and kidney issues and potential liver lesions. In contrast, another
three seals in captivity all died within 71 min after oil introduction
in the same manner as in field, which could be attributed to the
combined stress of oiling and captivity]{.underline} (Geraci and Smith,
1976). Unlike seals, [polar bears]{.underline} (Ursus maritimus)
[primarily depend on pelage to maintain their temperature; therefore,
they are susceptible to hypothermia because the insulative value of fur
is considerably reduced once oiled during spill incidents]{.underline}
(Hurst and Øritsland, 1982). [They also can ingest oil during grooming
or consuming oiled prey (e.g. seals) and inhale oil vapor to cause organ
troubles and harm respiratory and nervous systems]{.underline} (Jordan,
2013). Wilson et al. (2018) simulated a worst-case scenario for an oil
spill and estimated that up to 40 % of polar bears from the Chukchi Sea
could be affected. [Both seals and polar bears are highly dependent on
sea ice for essential activities such as hunting and resting. The
contamination of sea ice by spilled oil not only affects these
ice-dependent species but also causes cascading ecological effects
through the food web.]{.underline} Overall, our current knowledge and
understanding of the impacts of oil on Arctic marine mammals remains
limited due to small sample sizes and challenging field conditions.

2.5. Human

Arctic oil spills significantly threaten the health of coastal residents
and other people involved in cleanup operations. First, [oil spills can
cause physical/physiological effects on humans, including eye and dermal
irritation, respiratory issues, and headaches]{.underline} (Peres et
al., 2016); Second, [it can lead to mental health problems in people
exposed to oil. For example, people affected after the 1989 Exxon Valdez
oil spill exhibited a higher prevalence rate of generalized anxiety
disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder]{.underline}, with females
showing particular vulnerability (Palinkas et al., 1993). Indigenous
communities and fishermen experience more pronounced negative
psychosocial effects than other demographic groups (Picou and Gill,
1997). Third, [the harmful effects of oil on humans also can manifest
through genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and endocrine
toxicity]{.underline} (Laffon et al., 2013; Laffon et al., 2016).
Pérez-Cadahía et al. (2008) revealed that [people with cleanup tasks
exposed for longer durations exhibited higher micronucleus frequency and
lower proliferation indices, generating chronic human health
effects.]{.underline}

Large oil spill incidents and related cleanup operations have also
generated adverse social impacts. [Spilled oil did not directly affect
the Cordova community in Alaska (a fishing-based economy) during the
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill; however, the areas used for commercial
fishing and subsistence activities were contaminated and fish hatcheries
were also threatened, resulting in fish-related people and business
suffering huge losses]{.underline} (Russell et al., 2001). The Valdez
community in Alaska became the spill response center with a large influx
of oil spill cleanup personnel, placing substantial demands on community
and municipal services, such as elevated water consumption and airport
traffic (Rodin et al., 1992). Simultaneously, [public safety and health
resources become stretched with increased ambulance services, domestic
violence, crime rates, and social conflict]{.underline} (Gill et al.,
2012). For Alaska Natives, [the oil spill disaster not only seriously
affected their psychosocial well-being and disrupted their subsistence
activities but also disturbed their sociocultural milieu and core
cultural identity]{.underline} (Gill and Picou, 1997). [Many polluted
areas previously used for traditional hunting and fishing were closed,
significantly decreasing subsistence harvests; the safety issues of
these subsistence foods were also a major concern, forcing Alaska
Natives to rely on commercial food from outside the region]{.underline}
(Gill and Picou, 1997; Miraglia, 2002). [Oil pollution considerably
threatens the spiritual beliefs and daily behaviors of Native
communities.]{.underline}

[Oil spills can generate severe and persistent impacts on Arctic and
Subarctic wildlife and humans, and also can trigger cascading effects
throughout the ecosystem, affecting essential ecological processes and
resulting in long-term consequences.]{.underline} For example, [reducing
copepod populations due to oil pollution can directly decrease food
availability for predators, such as fish, birds, and marine mammals.
This may lead to population reductions of these predators and ultimately
disrupt ecological balance and ecosystem resilience.]{.underline}
Targeted regulations should be developed to protect these vulnerable
species, based on scientific evidence regarding the impacts of spilled
oil. Possible solutions include stricter controls on shipping routes and
oil exploration activities in sensitive areas, as well as long-term
monitoring and research programs after oil spills. Meanwhile, [oil
spills negatively affect the ecosystem services of Arctic and Subarctic
coastal areas, including fishing and tourism, cultural/recreational
values, climate regulation, and water quality.]{.underline} It is
necessary to assess the changes in ecosystem services to understand
comprehensive impacts of oil spills in cold regions. Including valuable
insights from indigenous communities ensures more culturally sensitive
and effective assessments and decision-making processes.

Wildlife habitat and climate change

These public lands encompass about 6,700 miles of rivers and streams
accessible to fish migrating from the ocean---including five varieties
of Pacific salmon, among other species supported by these waters.11
Nearly 15 million acres of the lands under review also fall within the
range of the Western Arctic caribou herd,12 one of the largest caribou
herds on the planet.13 Abundant moose populations and a vast number of
migratory birds and other species also utilize these diverse habitats.14

Particularly as Alaska is warming two to three times faster than the
global average,15 [these intact and well-connected BLM public lands
represent a vital buffer against the impacts of climate change. Several
Alaskan wildlife populations have seen major declines in recent years,
and remaining populations rely heavily on intact, protected
lands.]{.underline}16 [Resilient populations of chinook and sockeye
salmon in the Bristol Bay watershed depend on the interconnected
"habitat mosaics" that characterize their spawning and rearing grounds,
utilizing different parts of the watershed at different times and
allowing them to adapt to shifting conditions.]{.underline}17 Likewise,
[three of North America's largest caribou herds depend on the BLM lands
under review, which support intact migration corridors necessary to
support robust populations.]{.underline}18 Revoking protections for
these lands and waters and allowing industrial development would
fragment habitat needed to protect vulnerable fish and wildlife
populations from the effects of climate change.

In addition to their climate resilience values, [these lands also hold
important reservoirs of natural carbon important for managing the
climate crisis.]{.underline} [The public lands under review have been
estimated to store]{.underline} 164 million tons of "irrecoverable
carbon," which is carbon that would not recover by midcentury if
released now by human activity.19 That equates to more than [600 million
tons of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, or the emissions from burning
roughly 8 million tanker trucks' worth of gasoline.20

Alaska Native subsistence resources

[Approximately 80 percent of Alaska Native villages (183 total) and more
than half a million people live within 50 miles of the BLM lands under
evaluation.]{.underline}21 [Of the lands under review, 74 percent are
designated by the federal government as areas where rural community
residents have priority to hunt and fish for subsistence.]{.underline}22

[Subsistence harvesting is a foundational element of Alaska Native
traditions, as well as an important source of food, economic stability,
and other needs.]{.underline}23 [The overwhelming majority of rural
Alaskans rely on food harvested from the surrounding lands and waters,
with 86 percent of rural households consuming wild game and 95 percent
consuming wild fish.24 More than a method of obtaining nutrition,
subsistence is a pillar of Alaska Native culture and a process of
communal sharing and generational bonding.]{.underline}25

Under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, federal
agencies are required to consider and minimize adverse impacts to
subsistence uses in public land use decisions.26 In passing the law in
1980, Congress found that ["the continuation of the opportunity for
subsistence uses ... is essential to Native physical, economic,
traditional, and cultural existence."]{.underline}27

Revoking D-1 protections would open those [public lands to industrial
minerals development]{.underline}, resulting in likely [impacts to fish
and wildlife populations and displacement of subsistence
activities.]{.underline}28 Additionally, lifting D-1 protections and
subsequent conveyance of some of those lands to the state of Alaska
would result in Alaska Native communities and other rural residents
losing priority for subsistence use of fish and wildlife resources
offered by the federal government on federal lands.29 This subsistence
priority enables subsistence activities locally, with beneficial harvest
limits and hunting seasons and according to traditional customs.30

A. An Inuit Framework for Food Security and Food Sovereignty

In 2020, the ICC Alaska published Food Sovereignty and Self-Governance:
Inuit Role in Managing Arctic Marine Resources. The 144-page report
documents resource management in Inuit communities in Alaska and the
Inuvialuit Settlement Region of Canada. [It analyzes the legislative and
regulatory structures that govern Inuit food security and evaluates
existing co-management schemes. Moreover, the report offers a framework
for understanding food security rooted in Indigenous Knowledge, using
theoretical tools devised by and for Inuit. The ICC Alaska framework
recognizes that [food security]{.mark} involves **[more than material
subsistence]{.mark}** because [food-based practices]{.mark} are [bound
up with]{.mark} **[spirituality, linguistics, knowledge, environmental
health, and self-governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}33 The report
ultimately asserts that food security requires ["food sovereignty,"
[defined as:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[the [right]{.mark} of all Inuit [to define]{.mark} their [own hunting,
gathering, fishing, land, and water policies;]{.mark} the [right to
define]{.mark} [what is]{.mark} [sustainably, socially, economically,
and culturally appropriate for the distribution of food and to maintain
ecological health;]{.mark} and the [right to obtain and maintain
practices that ensure]{.mark} access to tools needed to [obtain,
process, store, and consume traditional foods.]{.mark}]{.underline}34

While ICC Alaska uses the language of rights to describe the concept of
food sovereignty, structurally, [the distinction between food security
and food sovereignty involves power. [Food sovereignty ensures food
security]{.mark} insofar as it [requires Native control of Native
foods,]{.mark} which [in turn requires control over resources and
land.]{.mark}]{.underline}35

[This notion of food sovereignty stands apart from Alaska's existing
resource management strategies, including models developed by
progressive management researchers and regulators who embrace the
rhetoric of co-management and Indigenous Knowledge.]{.underline} As Part
III details, [academic and professional discussions of subsistence
rights and resource management feature a limited space for change,
restricted by technocratic and colonial assumptions. These restrictive
visions of co-management seek to fit Indigenous consultants and
Indigenous Knowledge into the existing American management
framework.]{.underline} They fail to imagine a real transfer of
decision-making power to Natives, let alone management regimes
structurally informed by Native worldviews. To achieve the ICC Alaska
notion of food sovereignty, the discourse of co-management must be
upset.

Understanding issues of tribal energy sovereignty in the United States
requires researchers to look back to the first interactions between
Native Americans and European settlers. Since the establishment of the
United States, [federal government actions towards Native nations have
evolved from genocidal to discriminatory to]{.underline}, in more recent
years, [halting efforts to secure the **sovereignty** and **resources**
to which Native nations are entitled. When tribes possess energy
sovereignty, they have **agency in determining whether development will
occur**, and]{.underline} if it does, [how that]{.underline} development
[will affect their lands and people]{.underline}.

Although Native nations and their citizens will determine the direction
of their own economies, the federal government can support tribal energy
sovereignty by providing financial and technical assistance to support
the development of those plans, then make them a reality. Despite the
fact that federal agencies have established programs and tools dedicated
to energy development on reservation land, their effectiveness to date
appears quite limited, and has not been carefully examined in the
literature. Such evaluation could be a useful tool to improve upon
existing programs and further support Native nations in their
energy-related decision making.

[As the US and the world transition towards]{.underline} a
[net-zero]{.underline} emissions future, [tribes whose economic
well-being are closely tied to fossil fuel development **may need to
diversify their economies or use revenue from fossil fuels as a
springboard for other investments**. Some Native nations]{.underline},
such as the Crow, Navajo, and Northern Cheyenne have [already
experienced **substantial economic disruptions** associated with the
closure of coal mines and power plants]{.underline} (e.g., \[110,111\]).
[Others]{.underline}, such as the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, [have built
large financial assets that can provide an economic cushion against
a]{.underline} potential [decline in oil and]{.underline} natural [gas
production]{.underline}.

In addition, some Native nations are pursuing innovative technologies
that utilize their fossil fuel resources in lower- and zero-emitting
technologies. For example, the MHA Nation is pursuing a partnership to
provide natural gas to a nearby hydrogen manufacturing facility \[112\].
As another example, the SUIT are pursuing a partnership to deploy an
innovative natural gas-fired power generation technology that produces a
pure stream of CO2 that can readily be sold (e.g., for enhanced oil
recovery) or stored \[113\]. In addition, the declining costs of
renewable energy technologies coupled with changes in federal policy may
speed the deployment of clean energy on reservation land \[63,90,114\].

Whatever Native nations may decide, they will need access not only to
standard analytical tools such as environmental impact assessments and
benefit-cost analyses, but also tools that account for the cultural,
spiritual, and other resources specific to each tribe. The development
and deployment of such decision aids has been limited in the past, and
their expansion could further support tribal energy sovereignty.

5\. Conclusion

For centuries, [Native nations in the **U**nited **S**tates have worked
to ensure]{.underline} the [full exercise of their sovereign
rights]{.underline}. In this review, we examine the key barriers to, and
tools to secure, tribal sovereignty over their decisions related to
energy production. Although there is a long history of injustice
regarding Native nations\' interactions with the US federal government,
[tribes have taken a variety of approaches to enhance their control over
their energy futures]{.underline}. In recent decades, [Native nations
have adopted innovative governance approaches and wielded political
power in support of this]{.underline} goal. More recently, new federal
policies, new technologies, and innovative indigenous-led approaches
have opened up possibilities for new energy development on tribal lands,
including fossil- and non-fossil fuel-based technologies. Looking
forward, substantial barriers remain to securing energy sovereignty for
Native nations. However, these recent developments offer cause for
cautious optimism.

Communities]{.underline}**

External Drivers

[In 2012, Lloyd's of London predicted that the Arctic "will attract
\$100 billion in new investment over the next decade" but "urged
companies not to 'rush in'" (Ward cited in Kroh and Conathan, 2012).
They noted \"hard-to-manage risks\" including knowledge gaps,
challenging and unpredictable conditions, potentially worse
environmental consequences, and \"politics of Arctic economic
development are controversial and fluid\" (Kroh and Conathan,
2012).]{.underline} In conjunction with the operational risks noted by
Lloyds, companies operating in the Arctic must consider reputational
risks, legal risks, and the costs of company-community conflict. [These
risks create external drivers that are the premise for policies like the
IFC Performance Standards and motivate companies to implement risk
reduction policies such as **benefit sharing**. Reputational risks arise
from failure to gain a **social license to operate** (SLO) and external
perceptions of a company\'s compliance with international standards,
such as FPIC (See Table 1). Not taking SLO seriously, companies may
\"forfeit millions of dollars due to operational delays\...due to
**resistance of indigenous peoples**\" and social rights activists (Lehr
and Smith, 2010).25]{.underline} Legal risks include injunctions by
courts halting exploration, e.g. Alaska Wilderness League v. Kempthorne,
and operation and suits filed against companies that require lengthy
litigation. Company-community conflict can result in considerable costs,
including elevated security, project modification, material damage, lost
productivity, loss of future market access, and more (Davis and Franks,
2014). Since multinational oil and gas companies self-fund these
projects, they are less responsive to standards set by international
lenders and primarily concerned with reputation, insurance, and
litigation.

This dissertation aims to help extractive companies recognize [\"there
is a positive proposition behind it, particularly in places like the
Arctic because there\'s a lot of things that can be learned \[from\]
traditional communities\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021).]{.underline} An
often overlooked layer is the timeframe of different industries to
quantify and respond to these ESG pressures. [In the resource extraction
industry, where operations can last several decades, few are aware and
fully understand the long process that pre-empts any exploration and
development.]{.underline} Slaiby (Interview 2021) shared with me how
\"IOCs (international oil companies) in general are thinking of
decades-long relationships\". He explains that when \"\[communities\]
wanted the best of both worlds, \[Shell\] said fine because not doing
that would create conflict \[and\] when times get tough\...they\'re
going to be jumping right down your throat\" (Interview 2021). He
contrasts this to \"private equity \[and\] smaller cap companies\" that
have \"a smaller investment window, there\'s different pressures, and
there\'s lack of pressures on some things\". This differentiation in
project life cycles is a motivating factor for companies and a
potentially novel consideration for activists and academics in
sustainability.

[As shown by the Alaskan Model, **benefit sharing agreements** that
empower indigenous communities to utilize **TK** and take ownership of
projects **mitigates** a number of these risks.]{.underline}26 West
(Interview 2021) explains that in \"extractive industries\...no matter
what agreement is reached with the government; no matter what benefit
sharing has worked out with Indigenous people; no matter what
environmental practices they evoke\", contracts will continually be
renegotiated depending on demand and price of mineral commodities. From
his years of experience working in the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC), he understands \"it\'s a political reality
\[extractive companies\] have to deal with\" (Interview 2021).
[Nonetheless, \"spending a little more time getting it right from the
get-go\" will build a foundation for open and respectful renegotiation
rather than litigation (Interview Slaiby, 2021). These external drivers
to reduce ESG risks are only half of the argument for respectfully
engaging and partnering with these communities.]{.underline} The case
studies below demonstrate how benefit sharing and working with, not
against or around, indigenous communities can create benefits that flow
both ways.

Internal Drivers

[A surprising finding of my conversations with extractive industry
managers and indigenous leaders, which in Alaska often overlap, was
their appreciation for the same values and the long term perspective.27
The alliances and relationships formed between these historically
opposed groups were primarily fostered by shared interests rather than
external drivers, not excluding their shared desire for
income.]{.underline} When I asked [Slaiby]{.underline}, \"what were the
motivating factors that made you want to partner with these
communities?\" the first thing he said was \"respect for elders\"
(Interview 2021). He [genuinely valued and was motivated by the ethos of
Alaska Natives. He highlighted their \"views on family and lack of
materialism\" and especially \"their love of food and their
reverence\...the idea that you take only what you need\" lastly
\"sharing, absolutely important\" (Interview 2021). Similarly, when
Hensley (Interview 2021) spoke of Inuit values, he said, \"we treated
each other with respect, we respected our elders, we loved our children,
we worked hard, we had a sense of humour, we understood our environment,
we share, \[and\] we cooperated\". These two did not verbally
communicate about these values. Rather they were observed and known
through the experience of co-inhabiting Alaska, e.g. hunting, camping,
and dining together]{.underline}. The policies and approaches (see
Table 1) nor western corporate etiquette promote this \'way of knowing\'
and sharing cultures and benefits.

[The unforced and unspoken method of sharing values reveals that
incorporating indigenous ethos into corporate consciousness is possible
but requires empathy, sociability, and keeping an open mind. Slaiby
drives home the importance of \"the right mindset, and\...the right
values\" for outside companies. He explains, "what you're doing is
you're setting up a situation that's going to be way **more
sustainable**\...you're building on concrete, rather than sand"
(Interview 2021). That way, \"when things go wrong, which inevitably,
they do...\[they\] had built the foundation on bedrock in Alaska by
being \[themselves\] and really deeply caring about the organization
\[they\] put together\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021).]{.underline} Glenn
(Interview 2021) suggested another way to share indigenous expertise is
\"if you develop an alliance, like \'I trust you. You trust me\'\" then
indigenous people will \"think it\'s important to\...share with you\".
Building trust is so critical that \"if \[outside workers\] had no touch
with the communities \[Slaiby\] stopped them from going into the
communities\" (Interview 2021). He explained that \"\[Shell\] hired
people who legitimately cared about the cultures that they work in\"
(Interview Slaiby, 2021). It was easier to build relationships \"because
\[Alaska Natives and non-native workers\] were kind of cut from the same
cloth\...the guys who work in the extraction areas\...grew up hunting,
fishing and outdoors and\...there was kind of an affinity\" (Interview
Slaiby, 2021). [Beyond the external drivers, only empathetic corporate
leadership will drive change in corporate consciousness.]{.underline} My
research leads me to believe that external drivers alone cannot create
the genuine trust needed to facilitate sustainable partnerships for
benefit sharing.

Looking through the governance lens of the ESG kaleidoscope, [corporate
leadership will need to have business and emotional intelligence to
create resilient and sustainable development. Because indigenous
education develops a multidimensional perspective, indigenous people can
lead with the head and the heart.]{.underline} For example, Edward Itta
was \"a whaling captain\" responsible for the lives of his crew and as
Mayor of the North Slope Borough, he \"negotiated \[monetary benefits\]
with oil companies\" (Waldholz, 2016). Reiss says, \"whether he was
talking with an Inupiaq person\...or an oil person, \[Itta\] could
really feel your heart, and respond to it, as one human does to
another\" (Waldholz, 2016). [Executives of extractive companies should
feel internally motivated to work with NCs that already embody this
resilient, pragmatic governance model.]{.underline} Saliby's perspective
and close work with Itta exemplify the empathetic leadership for which
this dissertation argues.

Despite popular opinion, he is not an anomaly. [Mack (Interview, 2021)
said, "my impression of oil companies is\...most of the people\...view
themselves as a big part of making the world a better place; \[they\]
want to view their work as being something greater than just making a
buck".]{.underline} That corporate consciousness parallels the
previously stated concerns of Aaron Schutt, Willie Hensley, Richard
Glenn, and Edward Itta. [Once again, Slaiby\'s internal motivations
align with his indigenous counterparts, highlighting why he built trust
where others have failed. An excellent practice note for empathetic
leadership was setting personal goals for **success**.]{.underline}
Slaiby (Interview, 2021) explains how he decided that he was \"going to
be successful and enjoy \[working in Alaska\], if \[he\'s\]
left\...things a little better\". Slaiby\'s retrospection demonstrates
the self-reflection for corporate leaders considering whether or not
they have the right mentality to partner with indigenous communities in
the Arctic.

Case Studies of Benefit Sharing

[The following cases provide good practice examples for benefit sharing
agreements between outside companies and indigenous communities in the
Alaskan Arctic]{.underline}. These Alaskan cases highlight the
initiative and foresight shown by indigenous leaders and outside company
leadership even before many approaches to benefit sharing were fully
formed (See Table 1).

NANA- Teck Red Dog Mine

[The Red Dog mine ("Red Dog") is one of the world's largest zinc mines
located north of the Arctic Circle in northwest Alaska. Starting in
1982, Red Dog developed a system of "collaborative governance" using an
"innovative operating agreement between mining companies and indigenous
people" (Sustainable Mining through Collaborative Governance at Red Dog
Operations, no date).]{.underline} Hensley was the president of NANA
corporation at the time and negotiated the terms of the benefit sharing
partnership of Red Dog. He explains, \"we were able to get what we
wanted\...because we own and control\...this multi-billion dollar
resource that was the richest in the world\...at the time and so that
gave us a lot of clout at the negotiating table\" (Interview Hensley,
2021). [As owners of the land, the NC negotiates the same agreement as
non-native landowner leasing to developers. However, because the NANA
Regional Corporation represents Inupiat shareholders, the company must
consider the principles of benefit sharing and create value for a wider
community. Hensley lists the unique ways they altered the western
operating agreement to meet the needs of the communities in the
Northwest Alaskan Arctic. The agreement included \"strict indigenous
hire provisions\...reporting requirements\...and \[instituted\] a
subsistence committee that was responsible for environmental issues\"
(Interview Hensley, 2021).]{.underline} Teck empowered the Alaska
Natives through the Management Committee made of six representatives
from Teck and six from NANA (Sustainable Mining through Collaborative
Governance at Red Dog Operations, no date). [The committee has
"oversight of exploration, mineral development and production" and
ensures "safeguarding the physical, cultural, economic, social and
subsistence needs of the residents in the NANA region" (Sustainable
Mining through Collaborative Governance at Red Dog Operations, no
date).]{.underline} Hensley (Interview 2021) highlights "the substantial
power that was given to nearby villages through this subsistence
committee". Similar to the North Slope Borough, ["the Red Dog
mine\...provides the revenue... to have a **regional government**, which
is very beneficial to our communities" (Interview Hensley, 2021). The
NANA-Teck agreement demonstrates both the **local hire and ownership**
types of benefit sharing in Chapter 3.]{.underline}

[Similar to how Hensley described the ANCSA Corporations, NANA filled
the empty construct of an operating agreement by incorporating
indigenous values and TK. The horizontal power relationship between the
outside company as operator and indigenous communities as owner allowed
for this prime example of benefit sharing built on a solid foundation of
trust. In 2019, 57% of Red Dog\'s workforce were NANA shareholders, and
\$155 million was spent on indigenous suppliers (Sustainable Mining
through Collaborative Governance at Red Dog Operations, no
date).]{.underline} In addition to monetary benefits, Red Dog supports
programs like the John Baker Youth Leaders program, \"an anti-bullying
and suicide prevention program\" (Westlake, 2016). [Louis Steele speaks
about the benefits Red Dog provides to the villages. She
\"encourages\[s\] young women to come and work up at Red Dog\" because
\"if \[she\] could work in a man\'s world and succeed then they can do
it too\"(Steele, 2016).]{.underline} Her video was prominently featured
on Teck\'s Red Dog web page, implying that the partnership may have
influenced greater transparency and concern for the lives and voices of
stakeholders. That exemplifies the change in corporate consciousness
that this dissertation aims to promote.

NSB- Shell Offshore Oil and Gas

The case of Royal Dutch Shell\'s oil and gas exploration in Alaska from
2012 to 2015 has was frequently covered by outside news sources, most
commonly noting that the company "spent \$7 billion on an unsuccessful
drilling campaign" (Humpert, 2020 par.6). The following case study
presents an intimate account of the \'campaign\' through the
perspectives of the prominent leaders directly involved. [Unlike most
reports of Shell\'s activities, my research focuses on Shell\'s positive
progress working with communities. The first lesson for outsiders is
that "in Alaska\...you're going to get your ass handed to you\...you're
gonna get knocked down \[but\] it's how you get back up when people
judge you" (Interview Slaiby, 2021).]{.underline}

[After the Alaska Wilderness League v. Kempthorne injunction in 2007,
Shell\'s lease was approved in 2009. After that, however, they \"decided
\[they\] weren\'t going to drill...\[they\] wanted to be into these
communities in a different way\", so they utilized a program called 3D
negotiation (Interview Slaiby, 2021). 28 Slaiby explains how the Shell
team \"spent nine months...\[and\] mapped out every stakeholder
relationship\". The main point Slaiby (Interview 2021) made was \"**you
have to go slow to go fast**\...establishing those relationships for
years, going to the festivals, getting invited to the festivals, really
appreciating the culture\". What came out of \"a lot of soul searching\"
and years of negotiations put an **interesting twist on benefit
sharing** (Interview Slaiby, 2021).]{.underline} The most significant
change was Shell asked the ASRC to purchase overriding shares in a
jointventure, the Arctic Inupiat Offshore (AIO), \"to share the
development cost, bring in \[their\] views, \[their\] opinion\...as a
partner\". Treadwell (Interview 2021) described it as \"empowered
ownership\". [Shell incorporating the NC as equity partners redefined
the premises of benefit sharing because not only revenue but also costs
were divided.]{.underline} Although this seems counterintuitive to
benefit sharing, I want to reiterate Hensley\'s point that ownership is
the purest form of self-determination.

[When Shell started planning, Slaiby (Interview 2021) says, \"the
standards for drilling in the Arctic weren\'t all there\...we had to
work with \[ASRC\] on acceptable standards\".]{.underline} Creating the
NSB Shell Baseline Studies Program was where Itta and Slaiby aligned
their interests. Slaiby (Interview 2021) found \"\[Itta\] wanted that
economic stability, but \[without\] sacrificing \[the\] cultural
touchstone\...the subsistence lifestyle\". [Shell \"worked with them on
traditional knowledge\" giving indigenous experts a \"blank check\" and
\"didn\'t edit anything that they thought was important\" (Interview
Slaiby, 2021). He says that the western scientists were there to \"make
sure everything was done right...\[and\] frankly \[they\] never saw any
huge gaps\...maybe some of the whys were different, but the phenomena
were largely there\" (Interview 2021).]{.underline} 29Few outside of the
company and community recognize the trust and effort it took to complete
this ground breaking cross-cultural project that still functions today.

Now that Slaiby and Itta had a relationship, the next step was to
identify the community\'s needs. [Shell put their \"people from oil and
gas into the communities\...to explain what oil and gas might mean\" but
also \"be there to talk to people, find out what\'s underneath, what
their needs are and what their concerns are\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021).
When they listened, they ended up \"finding ways to bring
opportunity\...from subsistence advisers, marine mammal observers, embed
oil spill response people,\...and finding really good ways\...we could
put good people to work\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021). Another important
item that Slaiby focused on was not to displace people, i.e. the curse
of oil. So Shell \"brought in temporary camps\", ensured outside workers
\"weren\'t cleaning out grocery store shelves\", and \"focused on
creating the supply chain that actually benefits the community\"
(Interview Slaiby, 2021). All of this work integrating and ensuring the
sustainability of the community built a strong trust between the North
Slope people and Shell.]{.underline}

The relationship was tested on New Years of 2012 when a drillship going
from Dutch Harbor to Seattle broke loose and grounded on Kodiak Island.
Slaiby (Interview 2021) describes how \"they showed up in an instant,
knocking the ice off things\...we had the people behind us\". Shell
recovered quickly because \"we were very transparent about what we did\"
and \"for the four years\...we had really worked to try and be very
proficient in that space\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021). Reiss, the author
of The Eskimo and the Oil Man (2012), attested to Slaiby and Shell's
corporate consciousness of safety. [Reiss (Interview 2021) saw that
"when they made mistakes, their mistakes never came out of wanting to
abuse people\...the **mistakes were always** \[Shell's\] belief in their
own ability to do things **without consulting the indigenous
community**".]{.underline}

Slaiby worked closely with Edward Itta to \"make a lot of changes in
\[Shell\'s\] program that remain the rule of activity in the Arctic
today\" (Interview Mack, 2021). Slaiby exemplified empathetic leadership
and \"moved his company, he moved his own thinking, he did things, he
adopted \...a more indigenous view of the world\" (Interview Mack,
2021). [The biggest challenges were building trust after the injunction
in 2007, seeing from the other\'s perspective, and changing corporate
practices. Shell overcame these by creating value for all stakeholders
with 3D negotiation, co-producing science through the NSB Shell Baseline
Program, and using cultural awareness training led by indigenous to
foster ties between the Alaska Native and non-native
workers.]{.underline}

Kuupik Corporation- NSB - Oil Search

Since 1929, the multinational company Oil Search has built a positive
reputation for working with indigenous communities and operating in
challenging environments such as Papua New Guinea, Australia, and
Alaska. [Oil Search was suggested by Glenn (Interview 2021) as a
\"current good player\" because \"they took people on the land, and put
them to work at every strategy level within the company\...from
helicopter pilots and EMTs, to the lawyers and executives\". Oil Search
publicly promotes, \"**local employment \[is\] important for our social
license to operate**\" and accredits \"having a workforce that reflects
the areas where we operate strengthens our capability and
resilience\"(Sustainability: People, no date).]{.underline}

Their onshore operations in Alaska involve multiple native stakeholders,
including the North Slope Borough and Kuupik Corporation. [In the
\"pre-FEED\" (Front-End Engineering and Design) process, Oil Search
conducted a \"comprehensive independent Environmental Impact Study
(EIS)\...with **significant community engagement** and comment
periods\"(\'Material progress made on Pikka Unit Development, Alaska
North Slope, with major resource upgrade\', 2019). Mack explains how
Kuupik and Oil Search \"sat down at the table\...for six
months\...defining the geographic scope\...the subsistence terms, the
permit review\" before the company received the lease.]{.underline} The
first part of the conversation \"set up for \[Oil Search\] how \[they\]
view the world as an Inupiat group\" then \"the second part of the
conversation was the commercial aspects\" (Interview Mack, 2021).
[Consultation before leasing, Slaiby informed me, is uncommon since the
leases are through the federal government. However, **Oil Search\'s
approach aligns better with the principles of FPIC**. Responding to
concerns, Oil Search \"**slowed the process to incorporate more than 25
design improvements, to further minimize the environmental footprint and
local impact**\"(\'Material progress made on Pikka Unit Development,
Alaska North Slope, with major resource upgrade\', 2019). Oil Search\'s
practices exemplify and demonstrate that by **working closely with
communities through benefit sharing**, extractive companies benefit from
reduced ESG risks and indigenous environmental expertise.]{.underline}

Two important benefit sharing agreements that Oil Search incorporated
into their project were the re-zoning amendment requested by NSB and the
Land Use Agreement (LUA) with Kuupik Corporation. 30 [The zoning of the
development in the NSB is an essential part of benefit sharing because
revenue from property taxes paid by oil and gas development pay for many
social services (Interview Reiss, 2021). The amendment to the zoning map
of NSB \"modifies the land on which infrastructure\...will be
constructed from a conservation district to a resource development
district\"]{.underline} (\'Material progress made on Pikka Unit
Development, Alaska North Slope, with major resource upgrade\', 2019).

The LUA included \"Inupiat driven phrases, concepts, languages into a
western-style contract\...which allows them to be on our land, but they
have to...\[make\] sure that subsistence is active, thriving, and
protected\" (Interview Mack, 2021). The specific section that
incorporated these priorities was \"Guiding Principles and Intents\".
Mack (Interview 2021) paraphrased to me:

• [Oil search agrees to consult the Kuupik and give special
considerations to traditional knowledge regarding subsistence resources,
including migratory habitat pass, traditional hunting and trapping
areas.]{.underline}

• [Oil Search acknowledges that such subsistence considerations may
change over time. And it shall design its operations to minimize impacts
on the community of Nuiqsut cultural and subsistence practices and
protect and promote wildlife resources and subsistence.]{.underline}

• [Oil Search will incorporate requests relating to traditional
knowledge into its project design where practical.]{.underline}

The flexible language of this section reflects the \'conditions of
uncertainty\' mentioned by West and ensures that the main points of TK
and subsistence are enshrined. [Unlike consultation in FPIC, \"if they
don\'t do these things, this is a contract that \[Kuupik\] can take to
court\" (Interview Mack, 2021). The enforceability of this contract
distinguishes it from the standards of benefit sharing and consultation,
which operate more as guidance than a checklist.]{.underline} Applying
lessons from my research, the Oil Search's preliminary steps and
resulting agreements indicate a strong positive trajectory for their
development on the North Slope.

Practical Guidance

This dissertation has examined the challenges, considerations, and value
of benefit sharing agreements in the context of indigenous communities
in the Alaskan Arctic. The research shows that [outside companies,
especially the extraction industry, have the opportunity to create value
by partnering with local indigenous communities. However, acknowledging
the lack of enforceable and clear international governance, outside
companies should defer to local indigenous peoples for direction on
benefit sharing.]{.underline} From the analysis of lessons learned in
Alaska, the following protocol provides some practical guidance for
creating relationships, incorporating indigenous perspectives and
knowledge, and enhancing the sustainability of development.

1\. Recognizing the importance of empathetic leadership, [companies
should consider the project\'s leadership based on a genuine interest in
indigenous culture.]{.underline}

2\. To minimize reputational and legal risk, [companies should
incorporate to the extent possible international principles of free,
prior, and informed consent and self-determination into corporate
policies.]{.underline}

3\. Respecting the histories and sensitivities of indigenous
communities, [companies should provide cultural awareness training that
involves equal participation by outside workers and local
communities.]{.underline}

4\. Ensuring the minimal impact of development on ecology, subsistence
practices, and villages, [companies should take sufficient time to map
out stakeholder relationships and listen to stakeholder
concerns.]{.underline}

5\. Anticipating unforeseen difficulties of operating in the Arctic,
[companies should seek indigenous guidance and expertise early in
project planning, for example, understanding seasonal
ecosystems.]{.underline}

6\. Understanding the value of indigenous perspectives, [companies
should look for ways to incorporate indigenous people into all levels of
a project and empower their participation and leadership.]{.underline}

7\. Considering the life cycle of extraction projects, [companies should
co-produce policies on community engagement, value-laden principles and
intents, and establish a mechanism for conflict avoidance and
resolution.]{.underline}

The last three protocol specifically apply to consultation:

8\. [Enter a conversation full of empathy, \" with open \[mind\], open
ears, and an open heart\"; \"it\'s really more the spirit and intent of
coming forward...content driven, \[rather\] don\'t have an
agenda\"]{.underline} (Interview, Shorty 2021).

9\. [Seek out and \"ensure that the very best from the community is in
the room...that you have a fair representation...balance between men and
women...youth and elders\"]{.underline}

(Interview Shorty, 2021).

10\. Lastly, indigenous culture is very relational (Interview
Huntington, 2021). [Company representatives can show humility and
indicate openness by introducing their relations, to their family, to
the world around them, and lastly, to the project.]{.underline}

#### Native Alaskans want the plan, but only if they have an active role in economic development. It is key to maintaining their culture. 

**Harcharek 25**, \*President of the Voice of Arctic Iñupiat. (Nagruk
Harcharek, 2-13-2025, \"Letter: Iñupiat demand say in development of
Alaska's oil and gas\", Financial Times,
https://www.ft.com/content/5f0f72e9-30e9-4865-8d19-c7180fb43e3a?)//ishi

In the Energy Source newsletter, "Will Trump unleash Alaska's oil and
gas?" (FT.com, February 13), [Alexandra [White overlook]{.mark}s the
[most important voice]{.mark} in the national conversation about energy
and resource development policy in Alaska: the [**Indigenous**
**communities**]{.mark} [whose]{.mark} lands, **[local
economies]{.mark}**, and traditions will be [most impacted by federal
policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a result, many [Americans do not
understand that]{.underline} as Alaska's [North Slope
[Iñupiat]{.mark}]{.underline} we [**[support]{.mark}** an economic
[development process]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} frequent
**[consultations]{.mark}** [and **engagements**]{.mark}]{.underline}
with elected leaders about our land.

The North Slope Iñupiat have stewarded their land that now includes the
National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A) and the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) homelands, for over 10,000 years. Today, four of
our eight communities are the only villages located in the NPR-A and
one, Kaktovik, is the sole village within ANWR's 19mn-acre expanse. Just
like our ancestors, [we use our lands to sustain our **communities** and
**culture**]{.underline}, and we understand them better than anyone. Yet
[our voices and self-determination are frequently
overlooked]{.underline} by those with no connection to our lands or
people.

This [omission can generate]{.underline} [significant **real-world
consequences**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [the North Slope
Iñupiat]{.underline}. More than [[**95** per cent]{.mark}
of]{.underline} our region's [[tax base]{.mark} is [derived
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[taxation]{.mark} [of resource
development]{.mark} infrastructure]{.underline} --- not output --- and
is [used to fund essential modern services]{.underline}. This includes
amenities that are ubiquitous to the "Lower 48" --- as the contiguous US
is called --- but have only recently arrived on the North Slope,
[[including]{.mark} modern [water]{.mark} and sewer [systems]{.mark},
[schools, health clinics, and **wildlife** research]{.mark} and
management departments [to preserve our **subsistence**
resources]{.mark} for future generations.]{.underline}

The [impact]{.underline} of these services has been
[profound]{.underline}. [In 1969]{.underline}, our average [life
expectancy]{.underline} was just [34 years]{.underline}.
[Today]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} can [expect]{.underline} [to live
to]{.underline} an average of **[77 years]{.underline}**. This is one of
the largest increases of its kind in the US and is [due]{.underline} in
large part [to]{.underline} the [economic benefits of development
projects]{.underline} in our region.

President Trump's executive order to "unleash" energy production on the
North Slope is a positive step in the right direction. However[, it is
[important that]{.mark} the [administration]{.mark} [works
**collaboratively**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the North Slope
[Iñupiat]{.mark} [to build]{.mark} durable **[policy solutions]{.mark}**
providing long-term stability for our economy, communities and
culture.]{.underline} [The [only way to achieve this is by
listening]{.mark} [to]{.mark} our **[Indigenous voices]{.mark}**, by
including us at the policymaking table, [and unleashing]{.mark} our
**[Iñupiaq self-determination]{.mark}** in our homelands.]{.underline}

#### Only Native Alaskans co-management can solve\-\--they have an intricate knowledge of the environment that is absent otherwise.

Indigenous Education and Traditional Knowledge

When trying to understand and incorporate indigenous knowledge, it helps
to have an awareness of their epistemology. The first consideration
explained in this section is Indigenous education, i.e. ways of knowing,
presented through the stories and explanations of indigenous
participants. The second consideration, traditional knowledge, will be
presented through native and non-native perspectives. [They explain the
distinguishing features of land-based knowledge and the **value of
incorporating indigenous expertise**. My research leads me to believe
that western corporations need to think outside the box and look through
the broad view of indigenous education to sustainably co-develop the
Arctic. Kawagley explains that by \"trying to understand the parts to
understand the whole\" (categorization), \"\[western\] assumptions
(proposition) and expectations (syllogism) muddle **their** efforts to
see things as they really are\"(Kawagley, 1999 p.84). Norma Shorty
(Interview 2021) also describes the \"idea of a Western
methodology...\[as\] squares and blocks\...building blocks to knowledge
scaffolding\". On the other hand, they describe \"indigenous ways of
knowing\" as \"circular\" it-\"deals with the **whole physical,
intellectual, emotional, and spiritual of inner and outer
ecologies**\"(Kawagley, 1999 and Interview Shorty, 2021). This
circularity reflects both the connection of the knowledge to
environmental cycles but also human life cycles.]{.underline}

Creating a sustainable future requires both of these cycles to be in
harmony and indigenous people understand this better than outsiders
because they know the land. [Shorty (Interview 2021) notes it is
important \"to understand that indigenous knowledge is place based\" and
\"the stories and histories\...inform us how we can sustain our way of
life forever\".]{.underline} However, Glenn (Interview 2021) makes the
point that \"it\'s a use it or lose it culture\" and Schutt (Interview
2021) shared his concerns that too many youths were moving away from the
land. The ongoing migration from rural Alaska is detrimental to Arctic
knowledge since those growing up outside their lands lose the knowledge
from experience and the language skills to listen and learn from the
elders. To avoid further insertion of western epistemology, the
protection of indigenous culture \"belongs \[to\] the communities
\[but\] can be supported by these development players\" (Interview
Glenn, 2021).

Learning by observation, stories, and experience for thousands of years
has equip the indigenous communities of the Arctic with the knowledge to
innovate for, adapt to, and overcome challenges posed by their
environment. [Companies should consider how indigenous knowledge of the
land will affect their expectations for developers.]{.underline} Slaiby
(Interview 2021), former VP of Shell Alaska, explained that [\"what
traditional knowledge observes\...science cannot argue with the
phenomenon they\'ve been looking at for 12,000 years, they pretty much
got \[outsiders\] beat.\" Even if the indigenous experts cannot always
explain using scientific language, **they** understand their
environment. There are positive implications for western knowledge in
the Arctic because \"it can actually be very helpful in explaining some
of the phenomenon\" (Interview Slaiby, 2021). Arctic scientific
exploration has only scratched the tip of the iceberg. If outsiders \"do
it respectfully\...and use \[indigenous knowledge\] as a kind of mutual
expertise\...then \[they\] start to learn the lessons that have been
hard fought and paid for already in this traditional knowledge\"
(Interview Glenn, 2021).]{.underline} Much of this knowledge is embedded
in the language, making language conservation important for both
indigenous cultures and their partners. TK can assist with the areas of
working on and with sea ice and the protection of wildlife.

To demonstrate how [\"indigenous people wouldn\'t be consulted to the
detriment of both parties\"]{.underline}, Reiss (Interview 2021) told me
his experience in a Navy War Room simulation. When developing a response
plan to an oil spill in the Arctic, [there was no discussion about ice
until finally, Reiss himself mentioned, \"the ice comes in October\"; an
important consideration he picked up when working with Edward Itta
(Interview Reiss, 2021). Even in the 2010s, the **US Navy forgot the
existence of Alaska Natives as a necessary perspective for Arctic
planning**. Reiss (Interview 2021) explains that \"it never was
that...\[outsiders\] were looking down on locals, it was that they were
looking past locals\...they just didn\'t realize what they didn\'t know
\[and\] how they could maximize their own interests by cooperating with
locals\".]{.underline} There is a real danger for humans, for industry,
and for wildlife of missing important considerations, like understanding
sea ice, that are always on the minds of people who have lived in the
Arctic for millennia. Where outsiders see a \"beautiful painting of a
guy standing on an ice flow\", Edward Itta, former Mayor of the North
Slope Borough, sees \"a guy stranded on the ice flow because he didn\'t
pay attention\" (Itta cited in Interview Reiss, 2021).

[Including indigenous people in planning reduces the risk that outsiders
will miss an important consideration of TK. Even Slaiby, who \"drilled a
lot of wells\...in all kinds of areas\...harsh and benign environments\"
recognized that the \"\[DOI\] regulations aren\'t going to work \[in the
Arctic\]\"]{.underline} (Interview, 2021). Correspondingly, Edward Itta
said, \"the stuff you\'re doing won\'t work here\", so Slaiby worked
with Itta to \"recreate \[plans\] and \[put\] a program together that\'s
going to work for \[Alaska Natives and the Arctic\]\" (Interview 2021).
[Even when the federal government carries out **environmental impact
assessments** before leasing, their **outside scientists have
sometimes** fail**ed** to identify risks that indigenous people always
consider. Itta \"knew that his traditional knowledge was critically
important to his success in making sure the standards that apply for
offshore drilling were strong\" (Interview Mack, 2021).]{.underline} In
Alaska Wilderness League v. Kempthorne the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
held that [the federal assessors "failed to take a 'hard look' at the
effects Shell\'s project would have on the Inupiat\'s subsistence uses
of bowhead whales"]{.underline}(Nelson, 2008, Sec II (B)(2)). [The
opinion of the case cites that **the "\[environmental assessment\]
itself admits** that 'it is unknown what the increased level of effect"
Shell's proposed exploration would create (Nelson, 2008).22 The
'petitioners', who "contend that \[some\] assumption is erroneous"
repeatedly are the opinions of the whaling captains that Itta submitted
because "there was a pretty long record indicating **they hadn't taken
any other suggestions into consideration**" (Nelson, 2008 and Interview

in closing we turn to fantastical artwork that holds the violences of

creative and abundant futures. Our aim, as three scholars working at the
intersection of climate justice, geopolitics, and futurity, is to bring
race more firmly into conversations of the Anthropocene. We suggest that

reiterating these cliche´s in narrating environmental crisis. We focus
on renderings of the apocalypse in American popular culture as a window
into cultural anxieties, following scholars in media studies and
ecocriticism (Murray and Heumann, 2014; O'Brien, 2016;
Willoquet-Maricondi, 2010) and geography (Dittmer and Gray, 2010; Dodds,
2008; Kennedy and Lukinbeal, 1997; Lukinbeal and Zimmermann, 2006;
Sharp, 1998). Bettini (2013) and Hartmann (2010) caution that unexamined

[[from politics to security]{.underline}]{.mark}. The spillage of sci-fi
into science and security is not hypothetical; consider the U.S. Army's
recent "Mad Scientist Science Fiction Writing Contest," encouraging
contestants "to explore fresh ideas about the future of warfare and
technology\...with implications for how the Army operates in future
conflicts" (US Army Training and Doctrine Command, 2016). We write here
for political geographers, political ecologists, and scientists engaging
with the politics of the environmental future. It is beyond our
expertise to comprehensively detail genres of apocalypse, but rather we
outline three among many possible geo-historical junctures that can
clarify the political stakes of the Anthropocene. This does mean, as we
explain later, that our readings of the films lean into the cliche´s of
these genres, rather than untangle their simultaneous complexity. We
understand these geo-historical junctures as flashpoints of a
"master-narrative of the political unconscious" (Jameson, 1982), a
turbulent reckoning with what it means to be human that is fraught with
the racialized hauntings of genocide, slavery, and ongoing imperialism.
What kind of urgency does the Anthropocene produce? For whom? Baldwin
(2012: 172) argues [[whiteness]{.mark} is [figured through
"**tropes**]{.mark} **of**]{.underline} uncertainty, Utopia,
**[apocalypse]{.underline}**, prophesy, hope, fear, possibility and
potentiality." Here, we disaggregate futurity's tropes in conversation
with a parallel undoing of the fundamentally racialized definitions of
humanness (da Silva, 2011; Gilroy, 2018; Weheliye, 2014; Wynter, 2003).
At the core of processes that accelerated environmental devastation, now
represented as global, has been the consistent sacrifice of some lives
for the betterment of others. The Anthropocene uncomfortably reiterates
a nature/human binary figured in racialized terms, at times serving as a
proxy for deep-seated anxieties of racialized Others "taking over" the
planet. We construct three geo-historical junctures: a staged encounter
between geological proposals under review by the Anthropocene Working
Group and corresponding cinematic apocalyptic genres. Building on
Jameson's (1982: 153) articulation of sci-fi as dramatization of "our
incapacity to imagine the future\... the atrophy of the utopian
imagination," we analyze how these apocalyptic imaginaries break down or
intensify human/nature divisions in ways that sometimes disrupt but more
often reinvigorate a racial classification of humanity. We begin by
reviewing the Anthropocene as a collective contestation over what it
means to be human, elaborate our rationale for examining popular
culture, and then analyze the underlying racial premises of common
Hollywood tropes. We close the article with warning signs and alternate
imaginaries that disrupt this troubled legacy. Anthropocene as
apocalyptic futurity We build on a rich tradition of "storytelling" in
environmental justice activism and research (Houston and Vasudevan,
2017) that examines the Anthropocene as a narrative (Buell, 2014) whose
meaning is being contested among scientists, social movement actors,
critical theorists and cultural producers. What then do we learn from
the storytelling that takes place in debates over when the Anthropocene
began? Lewis and Maslin (2015, see also Davis and Todd, 2017) propose,
1610 as start date: the conquest of the Americas. This territorial
accumulation highlights, "a long-term and large-scale example of human
actions unleashing processes that are difficult to predict or manage"
(Lewis and Maslin, 2015: 177). While the, 1610 proposal has not gained
traction in the scientific community (Hamilton, 2015), its
acknowledgment of colonization's genocidal violence makes possible a
more incisive understanding of what is meant by the designation of the
epoch (Davis and Todd, 2017). Other proposals also highlight politically
charged moments in history, and are read as Gergan et al. 93 a
corrective to Enlightenment hubris (Lovbrand et al., 2009). As noted by
Robbins and € Moore (2013: 9), "Anthropocene scientific culture thus
simultaneously displays a panicked political imperative to intervene
more vocally and aggressively in an earth transformation run amok and an
increasing fear that past scientific claims about the character of
ecosystems and their transformation were overly normative, prescriptive,
or political in nature." Analyzing climate change as a literary
narrative explores how scientific knowledge gains traction,
"\[crystallizing\] the anxieties of a wider public" (Buell, 2014: 272).
For Yusoff (2013), this "geological turn" pushes our focus beyond social
relations with fossil fuels and human impacts on Earth, to think of
human being as itself geologically composed; the social then emerges as
an expression of geology and geochemistry. The Anthropocene debate
offers critical scholars a rare opportunity to engage with the
scientific community, making possible a more political geoscience
(Castree, 2015: 15). However, these proposals may elide who is contained
within the "human," while potentially legitimating "non-democratic and
technophilic approaches, such as geoengineering" (Baskin, 2015: 11).
Ahuja (2016) argues, "Geology is a spawn of the colonial capitalist
assemblage that is rapidly transforming the planet\... the discipline
cannot stand objectively outside the relations that term clumsily
attempts to name." We find ourselves in agreement with theorization of
the Capitalocene that challenges the narrative of a "fictitious human
unity" erasing the unevenness of ecological violence (Haraway, 2016;
Moore, 2017), and in agreement with critiques centering the persistent
role of colonial processes and settler colonialism as inseparable from
climate-driven conditions of violence (Davis and Todd, 2017; Whyte,
2016, 2013). For Baldwin (2014: 525), climate change anxieties reiterate
the human as a racial category "at a moment often characterized as
simultaneously post-racial and post-human." While post-humanist
scholarship has presented an important critique of the anthros,
postcolonial, decolonial and critical race studies suggest that analysis
of the Anthropocene must consider how colonial demarcations of the
human--nonhuman boundaries were premised upon and developed alongside
racial hierarchies of human difference (Gilroy, 2018; Jackson, 2013;
Livingstone et al., 2011). Ecological anxieties abound (Robbins and
Moore, 2013), and "fantasies of apocalypse are both a product and a
producer of the Anthropocene" (Ginn, 2015: 352). But what politics do
visions of future catastrophe engender (e.g. Baldwin, 2012; Ginn, 2015;
Katz, 1995; Schlosser, 2015; Skrimshire, 2010; Swyngedouw, 2013)?
Following the premise of popular geopolitics, we understand that popular
culture narratives enable particular forms of truth making, inciting
affective predispositions that generate political action (or inaction)
(Dittmer and Gray, 2010; Dodds, 2008; Sharp, 1998). Apocalyptic film can
be consumed as a spectacle of future ruin that closes space for
political action by fetishizing causes (such as carbon), proposing
technological fixes, and downplaying unevenly violent results of
ecological change. But it can also be a form of social dreaming that
makes different futures possible (Ginn, 2015; Schlosser, 2015). What
kind of present is generated by representations of the future that
reinscribe the racialized colonial origins of the Anthropocene? Future
rendered as "white decline" is fundamental to the operation of
biopolitical projects in the present (Smith and Vasudevan, 2017). This
anxiety is new in the specificity of Anthropocene as discourse, but also
contains strands of familiar apocalyptic imaginings, and crossover
between policy and pop culture. The cover of The Population Bomb
(Erhlich, 1968), centers a small white baby in a bomb to generate
anticipatory fear and action in the form of "population control." This
neoMalthusian vision is one among many cultural productions of its time
that reveal the undercurrent of fear under the guise of preventing war
and environmental catastrophe (Hartmann, 1995). But Public Enemy's, 1990
Fear of a Black Planet album cover art is, 94 EPD: Society and Space
38(1) to our eyes, a franker reading of overpopulation fears: a vision
of a Black planet eclipsing the earth, with Star Wars lettering and the
words "the counterattack on world supremacy" repeating at the bottom.
This cover art renders visible the submerged storylines of reversal and
takeover that occur through proxies and fantasy in mainstream pop
culture. White fragility (DiAngelo, 2011) is here stripped of pretense.
Geo-historical junctures and disasters as revelation As scholars sift
through the evidence to fix, subvert, or complicate the temporality of
the Anthropocene, their choice of markers echoes other imaginings of
disaster in revealing ways. In what follows, we trace webs of connection
between these geological markers and other imaginings of catastrophe, to
render visible the racial components of future-oriented anxiety in which
race is a fundamental but invisibilized mechanism of racial
neoliberalism (Baldwin, 2016; Goldberg, 2008). The determination of when
the Anthropocene began centers on potential "golden spikes" or Global
Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) markers that signal global change --
that is, markers in glacier ice, in rock, or in sediment. Along with a
geological imprint, Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) argued that the proposed
marker should correspond to an important global historical juncture,
demonstrating how the choice of geological marker then also becomes part
of a political story about human agency, culpability, the past, and the
future (Lewis and Maslin, 2015). Here, we consider three geo-historical
junctures in conjunction with corresponding cultural anxieties. First,
Crutzen and Stoermer (2000) and subsequent studies (Waters et al., 2016)
locate the start date of the Anthropocene in the Industrial Revolution.
In Steffen et al.'s (2007) proposal, the Anthropocene is divided into
three stages: Industrial Era (1800-- 1945) marked by fossil fuel
expansion, the "Great Acceleration" (1945--2015) marked by rapid
industrialization and population growth, and the third stage "Stewards
of the Earth System" (2015 onwards), a speculative period marked by
growing awareness of humanity's impact on nature. In this narrative of
teleological humanism, strangely reminiscent of a crude variety of
Marxism minus the labor theory of value, we find humanity as
speciescoming-into-being as stewards of the earth. However, any hubris
around humanity as geologic force finds itself wrestling with reports of
dramatic shifts in weather patterns, melting ice caps, species
extinction, and other unpredictable ecological outcomes. We identify the
narrative of rising panic about climactic conditions or unpredictable
nature overtaking humanity as The Great Deluge. Second, we consider the
proposal (Lewis and Maslin, 2015; Zalasiewicz et al., 2015) marking the
accumulation of radioactivity in sediment from nuclear fallout. This
marker of the Anthropocene is also referred to as the "Bomb spike": the
peak in plutonium and artificial radionuclides from nuclear bomb
testing. The first atomic explosion was conducted in New Mexico in 1945,
followed by a peak in testing between the 1950s and early 1960s. Lewis
and Maslin (2015) propose 1964 as the start date of this marker, because
of the distinct, measurable peak in atmospheric radiocarbon. This marker
not only refers to nuclear testing, but also the period since the 1950s
labeled The Great Acceleration, characterized by an intensification of
industrial and technological development of materials capable of
destroying human and ecological life. While nuclear testing was
celebrated as American techno-scientific might, for Lewis and Maslin
(2015: 177) this is a "story of an elite-driven technological
development that threatens planet-wide destruction." We identify this
proliferation of toxic and molecular nonhuman agents as Nuclear
Cataclysm. Third, we consider the proposal (Lewis and Maslin, 2015) that
the Anthropocene originates in 1610, marked by a dramatic increase in
carbon sequestration due to reforestation Gergan et al. 95 following the
colonization of the Americas (Lewis and Maslin, 2015). We map this
proposal onto the recurring trope of The Population Bomb and anxieties
about racialized populations. Lewis and Maslin (2015: 174) define the
"Orbis Spike," as follows: "The arrival of Europeans in the Caribbean in
1492, and subsequent annexing of the Americas, led to the largest human
population replacement in the past 13,000 years, the first global trade
networks linking Europe, China, Africa and the Americas, and the
resultant mixing of previously separate biotas, known as the Columbian
Exchange." This "exchange," led to an unfathomable decline: with an
estimated beginning population of between 54 and 61 million people being
reduced to 6 million within less than 200 years due to war, disease,
enslavement, and famine. This devastation left its mark as the
regeneration of an estimated 50 million hectares of forest led to
increased carbon uptake and a decline in atmospheric CO2 that in turn
was documented in Antarctic ice core records. Both Lewis & Maslin's
proposals and these films are warnings: they work to generate an
affective reaction and relationship to the environment with a specific
political intent. Here, we build on media analysis traditions in
geography and ecocriticism, to outline particular genres of
future-oriented cultural production (mainly films, but also science
fiction, art, television, music videos, and animation). We approach
these genres and particular exemplars as specific forms of apocalypse.
We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer who pointed to the dual
meaning of the term, apocalypse both as "a disaster resulting in
drastic, irreversible damage to human society or the environment,
especially on a global scale," and as "revelation" or "disclosure"
(Oxford English Dictionary Online, n.d.). Drawing on this understanding
of apocalypse as disasters that reveal, our approach has been to comb
through pervasive representations of apocalypse (here, mainly US)
popular culture, and outline the recurrent tropes that cohere into
specific genres. We began with an open field and developed a list of
cliche´d tropes of disaster films that contain an element of
futureorientation and generated box office success (we excluded, for
instance, Twister and alieninvasion films). Here, we created a broad
taxonomy that we hope to elaborate on in future work: nature's revenge
films, here captured in "The Great Deluge," films that evoke fears of
nuclear power or weapons gone awry, here designated as "Nuclear
Cataclysm," and zombie and contagion-based films that evoke
population-related fears, here glossed as "The Population Bomb." For the
Great Deluge and Population Bomb, we discuss the genre broadly, but then
focus on The Day after Tomorrow, and World War Z, respectively, which
are the highest lifetime grossing films of the two genres. For fears of
Nuclear Cataclysm, our task was complicated as we noticed a sharp rise
in films corresponding to Cold War geopolitics, and then a striking
absence after the 1980s, replaced by the genre of irradiated
Superheroes. We suggest that the absence of nuclear fears is itself
revealing of the uneven and racialized distribution of nuclear risk. We
want to emphasize that there are nuances in some of these individual
films that are well worth exploring, but that the scope of our argument
and limited space here confines us to much broader brushstrokes. We push
to consider the political implications of designating the starting point
of the Anthropocene by uncovering the meanings that inform the cultural
context within which these decisions are made, with special attention to
the "revelation," and "disclosure," of racialized evacuation of
responsibility or designation of culpability. This approach has led us
to three genres that for us form geo-historical junctures: collisions
between scientific reasoning of the Anthropocene and cultural fears that
are embedded in future imaginaries. Lukinbeal and Zimmermann (2006)
argue that cinematic technologies are embedded in sociocultural
practices, and that science fiction is particularly revealing (Jameson,
1982). How have films primed their audiences to interpret the future in
ways that both reflect and prefigure policy responses and ontological
assumptions about the ongoing and impending 96 EPD: Society and Space
38(1) effects of Anthropocene living? In the following section, we think
through the archive of existent cultural representations of future
catastrophe, and the eerie echoes that link cinematic cultural worlds
with the geologic era. In this, we find that apocalypse films, intended
as forms of revelation, often unwittingly reveal something other than
intended. The great deluge Fears of an ecological catastrophe fueled by
industrialization and overconsumption are reflected in the growing genre
of climate fiction or "cli-fi" (Dan Bloom, cited in Svoboda, 2016).
Whether they take the form of a hurricane full of sharks in Sharknado,
rising seas in Waterworld, synchronized hailstorms, tornadoes and
blizzards in The Day After Tomorrow (TDAT) or the eruption of the
earth's core in 2012, cli-fi films portend impending disaster where
nature takes revenge on an unwitting human population that realizes its
mistakes too late. On the surface, cli-fi films challenge climate
inaction by sensationalizing extreme events, a liberal Hollywood version
of Al Gore's charge to accept the "inconvenient truth" of climate
change. However, erasing the work of earlier generations of
eco-apocalyptic fables, such as Carson's Silent Spring which inspired a
generation of environmental activism, cli-fi obfuscates the connections
between climate change and structural conditions in a battle of
(triumphant survivor) Man v. (vengeful uncontrollable) Nature. In
cli-fi, disaster becomes another storyline for proclaiming white
victory. The predominant tendency in cli-fi is the representation of the
apocalypse as "The Great Deluge": a real or figurative wave that
threatens to overwhelm all humanity in climate events of biblical
proportions. TDAT is said to have generated more than ten times the news
coverage than the, 2001 IPCC report, and had a significant impact on
public understanding of climate change (Lieserowitz, 2004). At the
center of the story is a paleoclimatologist who draws attention to an
imminent Ice Age but is ignored by the powers that be. Superstorms wreak
havoc, and the scientist must save his trapped son in New York City. At
the end, the new Ice Age arrives, covering the northern hemisphere in
ice and snow, signaling that few survived except a small (mostly white)
resilient band. While TDAT was critiqued by many climatologists for
indulging in sensationalism and undermining scientific research, the
movie portrays the scientific community as morally unfettered to a
corrupt establishment. Here, scientists stand in for stewards of the
earth, who are charged with both a moral authority and responsibility, a
sentiment also reflected in Steffen et al.'s (2007) final stage of the
Anthropocene. This stage speculates how geo-engineering efforts might
offer solutions to our destructive human impact. This framing of science
as savior obscures how a scientific rationality laid the foundation for
Enlightenment thinking and the Industrial Revolution (Lovbrand et al.,
2009). € The "Great Deluge" trope retrenches inherited categories of
"human" versus "nature" implicit in the Anthropocene. Matthews and
Simpson (2014: 22), note that cli-fi "presents an unexpectedly feral,
unpredictable environment where an aggressive nature runs rampant." Even
if such stories begin with a critique of overconsumption, mid-way
through the narrative, the causal arrow points squarely at a vengeful
nature that must be subdued by humans. In TDAT, (as in World War Z,
below), the stand in for "human" is a white middle-aged man, evoking the
white savior trope and the scientist/savior figure (Murray and Heumann,
2014). As Tuck and Ree (2013: 640) note, mainstream (horror) US films
are "preoccupied with the hero, who is perfectly innocent, but who is
assaulted by monstering or haunting just the same." TDAT invests white
characters with scientific authority, as in one scene where a Black
police officer ignores the white lead's warnings, a mistake that
ultimately costs his and others' lives (McGreavy and Lindenfeld, 2014:
124). As climate change is declared a global Gergan et al. 97 threat,
white maleness stands in for a universal human subject and the first
sites to be destroyed are located in the northern hemisphere. On a more
fundamental level, the threat to "humanity" represented in Great Deluge
films are perhaps expressing what Baldwin (2016: 84) terms a white
affect, a "pre-discursive intensity that forms when white positionality
confronts the fantasy of its own death." For a growing number of people,
however, extreme weather events are not a dystopian future but a grim
reality, while simultaneously, the presumed threat of "climate refugee"
incursions is used to effect a securitization that targets migrants
themselves (Ahuja, 2016; Bettini, 2013; Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012;
Hartmann, 2010). Unlike the protagonists of TDAT, for those actually
facing climate change, "The world is sectioned into nationals and
nationalities for those who cannot afford to move or travel beyond their
home countries. For the rich, the world is indeed transnational and
deterritorialized" (Miyoshi, 2001: 292). The flip side of these films is
the desire for a security apparatus reliant on technological innovation
and governance. Through the construction of a seemingly universal
post-racial apocalypse, Great Deluge films suggest "the guarantee of
white supremacy lies in its capacity to contain the excess" (Baldwin,
2016: 84) of climate change's consequences. In films like TDAT, risks
posed by climate change are displaced onto others who are seen as
lacking the resourcefulness of the survivor and viewer. This deferral of
disaster to the future erases the ways in which climate change already
affects livelihoods (differentially). The urgency of apocalypse promotes
a temporality of anticipated white precarity belying the root causes of
the Anthropocene in the longue dure´e of racial capitalism. While
Hollywood movies in general center white male characters, cli-fi films
portrayal of a universal human threat through the experience of a white
Western core is at odds with realities of disparate vulnerability
articulated by climate justice movements (e.g. Chatterton et al., 2013;
Pettit, 2004; Pulido, 2012). This critique also draws our attention to
the uneven geopolitics of climate change and science (Lukinbeal and
Zimmermann, 2006), and how humanity has been defined in violent
opposition against Black people (Weheliye, 2014). Nuclear cataclysm In
analyzing the nuclear cataclysm genre alongside the "Bomb spike," a
radioactive isotope marker, the geopolitical context of this era becomes
quite significant. Both the film genre and the marker appear in the
aftermath of World War II where the hardening of borders and ideologies
was accompanied by the re-interpretation of terms such as "nation,"
"civilization," and "race" (Williams, 2011). In the context of the Cold
War, as former colonies declared their independence and challenged
Euro-Western imperialism, nuclear dominance stood in for scientific and
racial superiority. However, alongside triumphalist narratives of
scientific might, 1950s films articulated a growing fear that nuclear
technology could turn on its makers. In one of the first nuclear monster
movies, Them! (1954), we find eight-foot long irradiated ants discovered
in New Mexico after the Trinity tests. The same year, the cult classic
Japanese film, Gojira was released, later remade for American audiences
as Godzilla: King of the monsters. Noriega (1987: 68) notes the
difference in the Japanese and American versions; the former
symbolically repeats the trauma of Hiroshima, and the latter in its
destruction of Godzilla, seeks to "repress\[es\] American guilt and
anxieties about nuclear weapons." Sontag (1966; cited in Anisfield,
1995: 55) believes that the destruction wreaked by these monsters also
stimulated a cathartic moment for audiences, relieving them of their
nuclear anxiety and guilt by allowing them to participate in the fantasy
of "living through one's own death and more, the death of cities, the
destruction of humanity itself." In the 1950s, mutant monsters, whether
evolved from radiation or accidentally awakened 98 EPD: Society and
Space 38(1) from pre-historic slumber by nuclear testing, signaled a
growing fear of nuclear cataclysm as imminent threat. The Three-Mile
incident in Pennsylvania (1979) and Chernobyl disaster (1986) shifted
public fears from abstraction to reality, with films like The China
Syndrome (1979) and Silkwood (1983) featuring hyper-realistic
interpretations of nuclear war and contamination. The Day After (1983),
a made for television film, is perhaps the most well remembered, a film
that so affected Ronald Reagan he reconsidered his nuclear proliferation
plans (Gault, 2015). Set in Kansas, the film presents a full-scale
nuclear attack and its aftermath. As fears are building, a central
character commenting about the imminent destruction says, "Hiroshima was
peanuts." In dark irony, the film utilized declassified film and
photographs depicting the actual Hiroshima bombing; following this
four-minute long scene, the film manifests a bleak post-nuclear
landscape where annihilation is more desirable than survival. Mixed in
with fears of revenge exacted by racial others, or irradiated monsters,
was the awful possibility of "civilization" being blown back to a
primitive era. The film ends with a warning: "The catastrophic events
you have just witnessed are, in all likelihood, less severe than the
destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear
strike against the United States\..." Following Arundhati Roy's
injunction that nuclear weapons are "white weapons," Williams (2011)
argues that nuclear cataclysms in science fiction has always been
embedded with racial undertones, reflecting white moral and
technological superiority and its destructive recklessness. As the Cold
War ended, nuclear fears were gradually replaced in popular cultural
imaginary with mutant superheroes like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
who present an alternate story of mutation and radiation (Falkof, 2013).
In the trustworthy hands of Master Splinter and the ninja turtles,
radioactive waste could be used for good. In the leap from edgy comic
book to children's television, the turtles' mutation is never unsettling
or threatening, and is instead "superseded by the positive aspects of
their other traits \[teenagers who love pizzas and also happen to be
ninjas\]" (Falkof, 2013: 46). Nuclear force no longer engenders fear,
guilt, or anxiety in the viewer, sanitizing consequences of rampant and
uncontrolled nuclear power. That the mainstream incorporation of TMNT
has comedic elements and is produced for children marks the degree to
which this genre has undergone a radical transformation from earlier
iterations. Despite active concerns of nuclear waste disposal, ageing
reactors, and contamination in the eventuality of extreme events like
Fukushima, we find a notable absence of the Nuclear Cataclysm genre
after the 1980s. Even as we consider new representations of nuclear
technology, the question lingers, why has the Nuclear Cataclysm genre
faded and what has it been replaced with instead? To some extent,
American films have sublimated and redirected nuclear fears to terrorism
(Dodds, 2008). Moreover, global warming has led to a renewed optimism
around nuclear energy. Reporting on the ongoing cleanup efforts at
Fukushima, Miles O'Brien argues that disasters gave nuclear power a
dangerous reputation, but asks, "Is nuclear the villain here, or is it
inattention to iterating and improving the technology?" (Staff, 2017).
In this we find echoes of Steffen et al.'s (2007) final "Stewards of the
Earth System" stage of the Anthropocene and its belief that ecological
calamities can be averted with technophilic solutions. Optimism around
nuclear technology masks the sobering reality of toxic legacies of
uranium mining, processing, and waste disposal siting in the U.S, that
have most severely impacted indigenous populations and racialized
minorities from the U.S. Marshall Islands to the Navajo Nation and
Alaska (Houston, 2013; Kyne and Bolin, 2016). Given the racialized
burden of nuclear testing and siting -- an ongoing apocalypse -- its
absence in American popular consciousness is telling but perhaps
unsurprising. Gergan et al. 99 The population bomb The "Orbis Spike,"
binds white North American settler colonialism to catastrophe and
existential ecological crisis. However, in the eco-narratives that haunt
both putatively environmental policies of population control and
Hollywood fantasies, destructive invaders are figured quite differently.
The Population Bomb (Erhlich, 1968) asked on its cover: "Population
control or race to oblivion?" Neo-Malthusian fears imagine a
fundamentally Other, hungry, and unmanageable population: an untamable
horde. In 1973's Soylent Green, the future brings a dehumanized urban
mass fighting for green crackers\...the origin of which is ominously
revealed: "Soylent Green is people!" In a cannibalistic echo,
Snowpiercer (2013) takes us to 2031: on this dystopian train that serves
as a parable of economic class, food for the oppressed is made of
cockroaches, but small children are used as the train's replacement
parts. Baldwin's (2016) analysis of the climate migrant opens with a
description of a London art exhibit: Postcards from the future, in which
laundry hangs from landmarks, Jaipur monkeys clamber, and a squatter
settlement sprawls in front of Buckingham Palace. Race is not named, but
these images "scream race: the icons of Britishness, of whiteness\...
overrun by hordes of climate migrants" (Baldwin, 2016: 80; citing
Goldberg, 2008). We argue that white affect, entangled with fears of a
Black/brown population bomb, is sublimated and submerged by the
dehumanizing consumption of humans as food (Soylent Green), as machinery
(Snowpiercer), or as producers of life (Mad Max: Fury Road), in airports
as ominous vectors of extinction-threatening disease in films like
Contagion and Rise of Planet of the Apes, and through the lumbering
zombies of World War Z (WWZ), as we examine below. While emerging from
Afro-Caribbean cultural traditions and deeply tied to the violence of
slavery, refracted through cinema the zombie emerged as a different kind
of monster that could stand in for a range of horrors (McAlister, 2012;
McIntosh and Leverette, 2008; Schlosser, 2017; Strauss, 2015). McAlister
(2012: 461; see also Sheller, 2003) observes that the "the zombie
represents, responds to, and mystifies fear of slavery, collusion with
it, and rebellion against it." In Hollywood, zombies shift from being
racialized as mostly Black in the 1930s and 1940s to mostly white,
mindless stand-ins for the sins of consumerist and militaristic
Americans in the films of George Romero (1968's Night of the Living
Dead, and 1978's Dawn of the Dead); in Romero's films, human heroes are
often Black, while zombies are "Hyperwhites" (Bishop, 2008; McAlister,
2012; Schlosser, 2017). Read as a threat to the freedom of the private
self (May, 2010); as reaction to economic crisis (Fojas, 2017); as
response to terrorism (Bishop, 2009); and as subaltern monster
threatening colonial order through its postcolonial positioning (Bishop,
2008), zombies embody the edge of alterity (May, 2010; Saunders, 2012).
We follow Saunders (2012) in viewing the current zombie turn as newly
geopolitical and tied to fears of existential threat, but also maintain,
with McAlister (2012) and Bishop (2008), that the zombie is complexly
embedded in allegories of colonization. Schlosser (2017) posits zombies
as fear of the loss of individual freedom to collectivity; we find these
analyses of zombies to be commensurable with the framing of the white
protagonist facing off against the hordes. WWZ, the highest grossing
zombie movie in history, began as a novel written by Max Brooks, who was
inspired by Studs Terkel and by Romero's zombie movies (NPR Staff,
2012). The 2013 film departs wildly from the Brooks novel, and was
developed by actor Brad Pitt and director Marc Forster after they failed
to make a movie about AIDS (Holson, 2013). The film places Pitt as
Gerry, a savvy UN operative who must save the world. The central white
male character overcomes untenable odds through a potent mix of rational
100 EPD: Society and Space 38(1) and justified violence. He is motivated
to save "humanity," represented by his innocent white wife and
daughters, thus placing the reunification of the heteronormative white
family at the center of the drama (Fojas, 2017). The film repeatedly
reinforces the point that connection is danger and people can become
nonhuman: the opening credits splice images of people on their way to
work, silly talk shows, teeming ants, and wolves fighting and tearing at
prey. Absent Romero's critiques of race-relations and consumerism, or
the culturally rooted connection to slavery of the original zombie
mythology, the zombies of WWZ are an ideal proxy for the horde. Zombies
comprise teeming masses whose form remains identifiably human, but
unrecognizably monstrous -- in the terms of Tuck and Ree (2013, in
reference to Haraway), this is "making-killable." Within the film-world,
the deployment of violence, unfettered by moral concerns, celebrates
securitized settler colonialism enacted by the white protagonist through
a cunning mix of science, cool wits, and violence. Each site in the
film-world entrenches colonial geopolitics of security and control, but
here, the most revealing site of epidemic is Israel. An elaborate
conversation about the 1967 war justifies Israel as the most proactive
in taking steps to securitize their borders. Jerusalem's security wall
thus protects against a horde of dehumanized zombies that pile upon one
another like ants gone mad while they are attacked from the air. A brief
moment of Israelis and Palestinians singing together in cooperation
drives the zombies into a frenzy, leading to an irreparable breach as
zombies spill over the wall and wreak devastation. After infecting
himself with a deadly virus to become invisible to zombies, Pitt paves
the way for the WHO to begin implementing a vaccine program, while
people flee north to settle in for war. WWZ suggests that (militarized)
science is magic, and that connections between places lead to contagion
and dehumanization. A resilient white protagonist facing zombie hordes
and pestilence threatening human extermination takes on a bitterly
ironic resonance when put in relation to the conquest of the Americas.
Hinging between white settler colonialism's actual work of elimination
and pestilence (Stannard, 1993) and zombie and contagion narratives'
imagined dehumanization, decline, and illness, we see an epic reversal,
in which biopolitical mechanisms of white futurity are shored up by a
profoundly duplicitous representation of who is threatened and who is
threat. In WWZ, the mechanisms of settler colonialism are celebrated:
suspicion is heroic, walls enable survival, quarantine is necessary.
This ironic revisioning is one way that "white affect" (Baldwin, 2016)
rescripts historical events through fantasies of its own future death.
Outside Hollywood, this reversal emerges in policies that rewrite those
subordinated by structural oppression as threats to security and the
environment, or as helpless but dangerous victims (Bettini, 2013;
Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Hartmann, 2010; Sundberg, 2007). Descent into
chaos is mystified to promote support for classist and racist measures,
technological solutions, and security. Warning signs: How not to survive
an apocalypse By tracing how Anthropocene markers evoke apocalypse, we
complicate the "newness" of the Anthropocene, unravel threads that bind
it to racialized threat, and identify [the geopolitics of [apocalyptic
thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**perpetuate colonial** and
**imperial destruction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Anthropocene discourse
reflects Enlightenment thinking but also an attempt to redress it; that
is, it reflects the problematic centrality of humans and a
human/nonhuman binary even as it seeks to undo and problematize that
logic and its destructive effects. Can we preserve the urgency of the
Anthropocene without re-deploying destructive understandings of
humans/nonhumans? Following Goldberg (2008), Weheliye (2014), Baldwin
(2016), and others, we have sought to make visible how the future is
carelessly (or intentionally) reiterative of the Enlightenment
human/non-human demarcation that justified planetary colonization by
white Europeans, engendering current crises. In working through the
above analyses, we have identified cinematic tropes that double as
warning signs -- the points at which you shout at the screen: "Watch
out! You're in danger!" [As markers of white affect]{.underline}, they
further the differential **[[apocalyptic]{.underline}]{.mark}** outcomes
of the Anthropocene that reiterate death-dealing colonial violence. We
frame these as **[[warnings]{.underline}]{.mark}**, because they
[[emerge]{.underline}]{.mark} not only in films about mutant turtles and
zombies, but also [[in]{.mark} **scholarship** and
**[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When we encounter these, we suggest
looking back at what came before, looking around to see who is included,
and looking ahead, to examine what future is prefigured. Discussed in
detail below, the five warning signs are: (1) temporal displacement of
crisis into the future, (2) humans versus the horde, (3) the epic
reversal in which the oppressed become the oppressor, (4) science is
magic, and (5) the absence. Our first warning sign is "The apocalypse is
coming (the crisis has just begun)." [We [recommend **skepticism**
when]{.mark}]{.underline} environmental [[apocalypse is]{.mark}
described as **[impending]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Chimamanda Ngozi
Adichie (2009) cites poet Mourid Barghouti to consider the designation
of a starting point as a means of dispossession: "[if you [want to
**dispossess** a people]{.mark}]{.underline}, the simplest way to do it
is to tell their story and to [[start with,
'secondly]{.underline}]{.mark}.' Start the story with the arrows of the
Native Americans, and not with the arrival of the British, and you have
an entirely different story. Start the story with the failure of the
African state, and not with the colonial creation of the African state,
and you have an entirely different story." A similar move is made in
[framing]{.underline} the Anthropocene as impending. Films like TDAT and
WWZ place [[apocalypse]{.mark} in the present or near future, [a
temporal trickery that **erases the** ]{.mark}**already [existing racial
apocalypse]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Secondly, we note the recurrent trope
of "humans versus the horde." We implore attention to how some
characters are figured as preeminently human, while others may be
figured as teeming hordes. Alternately narrated as humans versus
zombies, or the white protagonist as savior, which renders people of
color extras or collateral damage, this trope is echoed in political
rhetoric of environmental conflict and scarcity, and in neo-Malthusian
visions of untamable population growth calling for population control
instead of reproductive justice. Here existing populations represent a
future world of "climate refugees," called into being to justify
security tactics (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Hartmann, 2010). Third, we
are struck by the tendency for epic reversals -- for rewritings that
flip the scripts of history by imagining worlds in which the oppressed
are the oppressors. With this warning sign, we attend to the curious
reversals that we observe in the genre of apocalypse films. Films like
WWZ rewrite disaster, casting the present or future as scenarios in
which a small band seeks to outwit monstrous others. But this is a
reversal of actual history, in which white colonization spread from
Europe leaving death and destruction in its wake and native people faced
with violence and disease. Some films self-consciously play with these
tropes, such as the revived Planet of the Apes franchise, which engages
the racialized tropes of the original film series to challenge a
simplistic reversal of power through a schism among the apes. Fourth, we
draw attention to the technocratic [threads suggesting]{.underline} that
"science is magic." "[We may have gotten it wrong before, but we just
have to fix this glitch," is a theme that runs through]{.underline} film
and [policy]{.underline}, as technological fixes and [accompanying
[attempts to **colonize space**]{.mark} are imagined to [provide an
**escape from social injustice**]{.mark}, **[overconsumption]{.mark}**,
[and **environmental catastrophe**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Snowpiercer's
premise defies the science is magic trope, portraying a world in which
an attempt to fix global warming by climate engineering has backfired,
plummeting the world into a global ice age, in which the only survivors
circle the globe in the dystopian microcosm of a perpetual trainride.
Finally, we ask: why do we see certain kinds of disasters in cinematic
form, while others are missing? In writing this paper, when we began to
develop a taxonomy of apocalyptic film genres, teeming hordes and
deluges of major cities flew quickly to mind. We were struck by ways
that other genres, such as [[fears of **Nuclear
Cataclysm**]{.underline}]{.mark}, seemed fixed in the past despite (or
perhaps because of?) ongoing risk as signaled by the recent meltdown in
Fukushima and cascading effects connected to climate/natural hazards. We
observe ongoing political use of nuclear fears in geopolitical
discussions of North Korea and Iran, and we see thoughtful engagement
with nuclear contamination in independent artistic work, but a marked
silence in the fantasy genre. Why? Have climate induced hazards
overwhelmed nuclear fears? The warning signs above are such common
tropes that we appreciate the films that subvert or deconstruct them,
such as Snowpiercer. But do we recognize these same [[tropes in]{.mark}
**political narratives**, **[policy suggestions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
and analyses of ongoing crisis? In our reading, the tropes above
[[spiral out]{.mark} from the foundation of the Anthropocene
itself]{.underline}, in a human/nonhuman distinction [[that comprises
the]{.mark} very [grammar of our undoing]{.mark}]{.underline} (Spillers,
2003; Weheliye, 2014; Wynter, 2003). Conclusion: Social dreaming and the
abundant apocalypse Here, we have interrogated how reversal, hordes, and
elision mark the white supremacy politics of the apocalypse. But do film
and art also have the power to dismantle such tropes and inspire new
worlds not premised on the present? For Ginn (2015), the Anthropocene as
apocalypse is hopeful, containing affective excesses or reserves beyond
anxiety that are necessary to fuel transformation, a kind of political
knowledge he calls "earth dreaming." Robbins and Moore (2013: 11)
identify an "ecological anxiety disorder," which emerges when ecological
questions cannot be answered without the "positing of political
questions." In our conditions of imperial ruination (Stoler, 2013), the
earth's climate system is "an experiment promulgated by the world's
wealthy and powerful, largely at the peril of the world's poor" (Robbins
and Moore, 2013: 14). It is omnipresent, bearing down on every decision
and making each further experiment both urgent and impossible. For
Houston (2013), environmental storytelling is "world making" that
emerges from communities dwelling in crisis -- apocalypse as here, now,
already in process, rather than deferred future. Recent work by
Derickson and MacKinnon (2015) suggests a "politics of resourcefulness,"
while Haraway (2016) encourages us to "stay with the trouble," and
Collard et al. (2015) encourage abundant futures with "more diverse and
autonomous forms of life and ways of living together." Responses to
these calls must be premised upon a radical unraveling of the "human"
center of Anthropocene imagining, and produce imaginings that render
clear how the lexicon of humanity has always been based on exclusionary
racial violence and logics (Spillers, 2003; Weheliye, 2014; Wolfe,
2006). Ghosh (2016) implores us to grapple through fiction with the
unimaginable challenges wrought by climate change. Movements like
Fighting Not Drowning, the People's Climate March, and Idle No More make
explicit connections to history, while also refusing to be contained by
it. In this conjuncture, we witness how political articulations grounded
in place-based movements are generating a "new planetary geographical
imagination" that are challenging "the violent normalizations of a
universal claiming to speak for the particular" (Jazeel, 2011: 87, 88).
These movements also demonstrate a refusal to accept the fundamentally
racialized nature of the human/non-human distinction that
Afro-pessimists and other critical race theorists have demonstrated is
fundamentally rooted in a violent bounding of humanity. Internal
politics notwithstanding, the ongoing refusal by the Standing Rock
Sioux, the broader Sioux nation, and the coalition of water protectors
to Gergan et al. 103 allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built at
Standing Rock disrupts colonial timelines of inevitability through
insistence on both sovereignty (Curley, 2016; Dhillon and Estes, 2016;
Whyte, 2017) and on the future as an insistently radical break. In
closing, we consider a few examples of cultural productions that reveal
the failures of apocalyptic thinking and address our warnings in novel
and promising ways. [[Rupturing]{.mark} the anemic and iterative
**[apocalyptic futurities]{.mark}**]{.underline} we analyze above, these
examples suggest a "collective sub-text" (Jameson, 1982: 148): a rising
popular consciousness that [[rejects the **master-narrative** of
**racialized humanity** in]{.mark} search of [**alternate** and
**abundant futurities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We hope that these
flashpoints of rupture will stir scholars of the Anthropocene to narrate
apocalypse with greater attention to the revelatory warning signs
outlined above, and inspire greater capacity for utopian imagination.
Janelle Mona´e's Q.U.E.E.N. music video (the acronym stands for Queers
Untouchables Emigrants Excommunicated and Negroid), part of her larger
conceptual project in which she is Cindi Mayweather, a messianic
android, both relies upon and disrupts the aesthetics of the imagined
future. Portraying herself and others as museum pieces, she uses the
white voice of a captor to describe her work as a "musical weapons
program" and her productions as freedom movements "disguised as songs,
motion pictures, and works of art." Mona´e builds on the narratives
generated by Sun Ra and by George Clinton and ParliamentFunkadelic, to
create time-traveling Black rebels sent back to disrupt the present
(English and Kim, 2013). Despite stating, as part of the Wondaland
collective, "We believe songs are spaceships. We believe music is the
weapon of the future. We believe books are stars" (Wondaland, n.d.;
cited in English and Kim, 2013: 218), Mona´e escapes the "science is
magic" and "teeming hordes" tropes through lyrics that "suggest that
pure optimism regarding technoculture understates its vulnerability to
being shaped by commodity culture and by regressive notions of human
subjectivity and categories of identity" (English and Kim, 2013: 218).
In a different register, Frazier (2016: 40) turns to Octavia Butler and
Wangechi Mutu, [to ["move beyond]{.mark} the limited [correctives made
available through the standards and conventions of **Western formal
politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}," and to "aesthetically reconstitute the
(un)limits of humanity and construct alternative conceptions of
ecological ethics within our present world and beyond it." Frazier
analyzes Butler's Parable of the Sower (1993) and Mutu's (2013) A
Fantastic Journey, noting that despite differences of nationality and
culture, both trouble ecology in promising ways. Parable's apocalypse
draws continuities to the past rather than rather than presenting a
break; indeed, "the most jarring element of Butler's future California
is its similarities in aesthetics and patterns to the world we inhabit
presently" (Frazier, 2016: 48). We are inspired by such work that
reveals a different sense of temporality, displaying continuity between
the past and ongoing injustice (the present past) or futurities that
require fundamental breaks with the present. Such imaginings are freed
from the trap of the "epic reversal": by addressing temporal continuity,
white panic over the oppressed gaining power does not drive the
narrative. We find an illustration of this in the recent Netflix series
Cleverman, which grapples with Australian settler-colonialism through a
potent blend of aboriginal history and mythology, sci-fi fantasy, and
allegory-heavy social commentary. The series emerged from indigenous
writer and producer Ryan Griffen's desire to give his young son a
comic-book style indigenous superhero (Baum, 2016). Set in a dystopian
near-future Australia, the series has been interpreted as commentary on
ongoing mistreatment of aboriginal groups and other people of color. The
show also redresses the erasure of indigenous artists and culture in
mainstream media, with a mostly indigenous cast, soundtracks from an
indigenous hip-hop artist, and dialogue by key characters in
Gumbaynhggir, an aboriginal language whose use was discouraged until
recently. Noting that eradication of cultures is also at the heart of
the Anthropocene, Tolia-Kelly (2016: 790) implores 104 EPD: Society and
Space 38(1) geographers, "to be mindful of our grammars, vocabularies,
genealogies, and versions of historical space-time, through which are we
articulating redress." We have argued that cultural production and
scientific production are entangled in the language and intent of social
movements and the working of geopolitics. As Davis and Todd (2017: 767)
suggest, "[[The stories we]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[[tell]{.underline}]{.mark} about the origins of the Anthropocene
implicate how we understand the relations we have with our
surrounds\...this understanding will [have **material implications** not
just for how we **understand the world**, but this understanding will
[have **material consequences**]{.mark}, [consequences that affect
**bodies** and **land**]{.mark}]{.underline}." How do we respond to
Baldwin's (2016: 86) observation that "white affect pre-conditions
population survival by repressing\... affirmative, nomadic imagination"?
One starting point is to engage with visions emerging from movements
that are grappling with ongoing apocalypse: their narratives do not
succumb easily to a dystopian future, calling instead upon powerful
themes of endurance and refusal. This is very much a literary decision:
what point of the Apocalyptic narrative are we in? The films we have
critiqued here take place during or in the immediate aftermath of
apocalyptic events. [[We argue for]{.underline}]{.mark} a more extended
time-frame, [[a refusal to start with "secondly]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(Adichie, 2009). If we begin from the premise that whiteness emerges
through and creates affective registers that prompt, enable, and
predispose certain people to particular political responses: how can we
intervene? What imaginaries of the future both enable a political
reckoning with the past and [[an **embodied refusal** of surrender to a
white]{.mark}]{.underline} eco-[[apocalyptic
future?]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Indigenous violence is a form of extinction itself and should be prioritized as it is constantly overlooked in literature. 

**Mitchell, 2017** \*Canada Research Chair in Global Political Ecology
Audra, 11-7-2017, lostspeciesday.org, "Decolonizing against extinction
part I: extinction is violence,"
[[https://www.lostspeciesday.org/?p=869]{.underline}](https://www.lostspeciesday.org/?p=869),
accessed 7-16, DG\]

[Western scientists\* are proclaiming the start of a 'sixth mass
extinction event' that may involve the destruction of more than three
quarters of earth's currently-existing life forms.]{.underline} In their
attempts to explain this phenomenon, most scientists have converged
around four major, interlinked drivers: climate change, habitat
destruction, species exchange, and the direct killing of plants and
animals. In most cases, these drivers are understood as the unintended
consequences of generic 'human' activity, and as a result of desirable
trends such as development or urbanization (Wilson 2002; Barnosky 2014;
Ceballos 2016).

[A crucial driver is missing from this list: transversal **structural
violence against Indigenous peoples** and their **relations, and
colonial violence in particular.**]{.underline}

['Structural violence' involves systemic forms of harm, exclusion and
discrimination that disproportionately affect particular groups, and
which can take many forms (physical, psychological, economic, gendered
and others).]{.underline} They are embedded in and expressed through
political, cultural, economic and social structures (Farmer 2009) that
can persist across large spans of time and space. I use the term
'transversal' to refer to forms of structural violence that extend
across multiple boundaries -- not only those of nation-states, but also
other kinds of nations (human and otherwise), communities or kinship
groups, and temporalities. Prime examples of transversal structural
violence include: settler colonialism, colonial genocides (Woolford et
al 2014); environmental racism or 'slow violence', including
toxification and pollution; and complexes of sexual, physical, communal,
spiritual and land-based violence associated with the extractive
industries.

Each of [these forms of violence is ecologically devastating, and their
convergence in European projects of colonisation is even more so. Many
formations of transversal structural violence are significant causes of
the so-called 'four horsemen' of extinction mentioned above. For
instance, 'direct killing' is carried out to clear land for settlement,
and it occurs as a result of ecological damage caused by resource
extraction.]{.underline} [Settler colonialism, carbon-based economies
and regimes of environmental racism also support forms of socio-economic
organization (for instance, carbon and energy-intensive urbanized
societies) that intensify climate change and increase habitat
destruction. Meanwhile, colonization has played a significant role in
the ongoing transfer of life forms across the planet -- whether
unintentionally (e.g. the transfer of fish in the bilge water of ships);
as an instrument of agricultural settlement (e.g. cattle ranching), or
as a deliberate strategy of violence (e.g. smallpox).]{.underline}

However, **[transversal structural violence is a driver of extinction in
itself]{.underline}**, with its own distinct manifestations. First, [it
involves the disruption or severance of relations and kinship structures
between humancommunities and other life forms, and the dissolution of
Indigenous systems of governance, laws and protocols that have
co-created and sustained plural worlds over millennia]{.underline}
(Borrows 2010; Atleo 2012; Kimmerer 2013). Second, [the **destruction**
of **Indigenous** knowledges through policies of **assimilation**,
**expropriation**, cultural appropriation and other strategies
undermines these forms of order and the relationships they nurture.
Third, the **displacement** of and/or restricted access to land by
Indigenous peoples interferes with practices of caring for land or
Country that are necessary for the survival of humans and other life
forms (Bawaka Country 2015). **Colonial genocides embody all of these
forms of destruction** by **killing** or **displacing Indigenous
communities**, **undermining Indigenous modes of governance and kinship
systems**, **systematically destroying relationships between life forms
and erasing knowledge.** All of these modes of violence weaken
co-constitutive relationships between Indigenous communities, other life
forms and ecosystems that have enabled their collaborative survival.
**This results in disruptions to ecosystems** -- and climate -- that
Potawatomi scholar Kyle Powys Whyte (2016) has recently argued would
have been considered a dystopia by his Ancestors.]{.underline}

I[n other words, transversal structural violence, and **colonial
violence in particular, are fundamental drivers of global patterns of
extinction.**]{.underline} [It stands to reason, then, that responses to
extinction that focus on managing endangered species or populations, or
'backing up' genetic material, are insufficient: they **leave the
structures of violence intact and may add to their power**. Instead,
efforts to address extinction need to focus on identifying, confronting
and **dismantling these formations of violen**ce, and on restoring or
strengthening the relations they sever.]{.underline}

Yet [responses to global patterns of extinction are **overwhelmingly
rooted in Western scientific concepts** of conservation]{.underline} --
a paradigm that emerged within 20th century European colonial government
structures (Adams 2004). Contemporary conservation approaches -- from
the creation of land and marine parks to the archiving of genetic
materials -- may exacerbate the destruction of relations between
Indigenous peoples and their relations. [For instance, conservation
strategies often involve displacing Indigenous peoples from the land
that they care for (Jago 2017, Brockington and Igoe 2006), or curtailing
of processes such as subsistence hunting, fishing or burning that have
enabled the co-survival of Indigenous groups, plants, animals and land
for millennia. Meanwhile, ex situ and genetic forms of conservation
(including zoos and gene banks) may violate these relationships by
instrumentalizing or commodifying kinship relations.]{.underline}
Increasingly popular conservation approaches based on Traditional
Ecological Knowledge (TEK) approaches claim to center Indigenous
communities and knowledges. [However, they ultimately instrumentalize
fragments of Indigenous knowledge systems (for instance, data on
climatic change) to test or support Western approaches. **As such, they
leave the structures of colonization and other forms of transversal
structural violence untouched, and may even exacerbate
them.**]{.underline}

SCT offers an incisive account of ongoing colonialism that cuts through
many of the conceptual knots that settler scholars have struggled with
since the NT intervention by providing a language that speaks to
continuity in the Australian political experience. It shows that [the
settler colonial narrative of **[gradual decolonization]{.mark}** is
layered over and [obscures]{.mark} a central [structural
continuity]{.mark}]{.underline}; as Patrick Wolfe famously put it,
settlers 'come to stay' and this makes 'colonisation a structure not an
event'.22 This distinction between postcolonial and settler colonial
realities reveals the label 'postcolonial' to be altogether inaccurate
in this context, and an instance of conceptual slippage which serves
Australian settler interests.23

This important insight is part of a new wave of theorizing about
political temporalities, and their implication in projects of
domination.24 SCT shows how [[settlers mobilize]{.mark} various
'**[technologies of temporality]{.mark}**']{.underline} (to adopt
Povinelli's useful term)25 [to tell a story of the immanent and
inevitable ending of both Indigenous existence and their own colonial
activity.]{.underline} At an abstract level, the settler project
imagines the beginning of settler society to coincide exactly with the
end of Aboriginal society. On the ground, however, [settlers have always
acknowledged a more or less **violent** overlap]{.underline}. In fact,
it is this period of simultaneous occupation of a single territory by
both Indigenous and settler political societies that can be thought of
as 'colonization' or 'colonialism'.

[**Simultaneous occupation** is an inherently problematic state for
settler polities]{.underline}, given that settlers assert a complete
jurisdiction over the territory and the presence of Indigenous political
societies prevents this claim from being actualized. Because of this
disruption, [[colonialism]{.mark} is always [framed as]{.mark} an
**[inherently temporary]{.mark}** state which will soon end and give way
to completed settler sovereignty]{.underline}. In this way settler
colonialism entrenches and sustains itself 'on the basis of its own
eventual demise'.26 If colonialism involves the simultaneous occupation
of one space by two political societies, colonial logic holds that only
the resolution of Aboriginal political difference and the end of
Aboriginal people as a political society will bring about the end of
settler colonialism. 27 This is the animating energy of the settler
'logic of elimination', and the reason for continual pre-emptive
declarations of the end of Aboriginal life. As Veracini28 points out: 'a
triumphant settler colonial circumstance, having ceased to be a
dependency of a colonizing metropole, having tamed the surrounding
"wilderness", having extinguished Indigenous autonomies, and having
successfully integrated various migratory waves, has also ceased being
settler colonial.'

[This insight reveals a further contribution of SCT, in its [challenges
to]{.mark} the established **[progressive-- conservative
distinction]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [settler
policy-making]{.mark}.]{.underline} [If [moves]{.mark} [to
resolve]{.mark} Indigenous [claims]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
reconciliation/[recognition]{.mark} also [serve]{.mark} the [settler
colonial attainment]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [sovereign legitimacy]{.mark}
and the extinguishment of]{.underline} Aboriginal [political challenges
to the state,]{.underline} this greatly complicates the progressive
settler goal of decolonization. Here [SCT echoes some critical
Indigenous scholarship in revealing the ways that both progressive and
conservative policy approaches seek to bring settler colonial conflict
to a close by [dissolving]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[persistent
**political independence**]{.mark}]{.underline} of Aboriginal
societies.29 [Exclusion and inclusion have [operated]{.mark} as [twin
strategies of set]{.mark}tler [col]{.mark}onialism]{.underline}
throughout the Australian experience, although we tend to understand
them in as being in temporal relationship of progress from the first to
the second. However, [they operate together all the more
powerfully]{.underline} for this perceived tension, [[**trapping
political resistance** and **energy**]{.mark} in the continual movement
**between** them]{.underline}.30 This is not to say that these colonial
strategies are morally or politically equivalent -- the means do matter
-- but rather to emphasize that [they are directed to achieving similar
ends, [by **eliminating, absorbing**]{.mark} [or **containing**
Indigenous]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} to the settler
sovereign order. In demonstrating that progressive settler actions have
often served colonial interests as effectively as conservative ones, SCT
delegitimizes existing settler anti-colonial passages.

This in turn must fundamentally challenge the political
self-understandings of many non-Indigenous critical scholars. If
colonialism exists as a structure in the present, then we are all still
settlers and still part of the political hegemonies that we describe.
This discomforting position may explain why many who use SCT move
ambiguously between postcolonial and settler colonial descriptors,
framing our situation both settler colonial and postcolonial.31 Many
retain a postcolonial framing of the present. Maddison,32 for example,
uses SCT to explain Australia's political past but describes the present
as simultaneously settler and postcolonial, arguing that 'the roots of
collective guilt were established in the structures of settler
colonialism and in the bonds of solidarity among, and later with, the
settlers that remain a part of contemporary Australian national
identity.' Through the phrase 'and later with',Maddison distances
contemporary Australians from the settlers who actually undertook
colonization. The political problem facing us becomes not ongoing
colonization but instead our subjective identification with earlier
colonizers and our refusal to enact a psychological 'substantive break
with the past'.33 Yet, as she notes in the same sentence, settler
colonialism is structural which means we are all still settlers in a
colonial space and it can serve no interests but our own to erase this.
[Even those using SCT to understand the political present have tended to
mobilize the temporal ambiguity described above]{.underline}, [for
example in presenting the intervention programme as a '[**reversion** to
settler]{.mark} colonial [tactics]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}.34
Howard- Wagner, for example, identifies the NT intervention as
particularly 'underpinned by a settler-colonial logic of replacement',35
while describing moves towards inclusion of Indigenous people in the
broader Australian polity in the 1960s as 'moments of unease and
disruption' which are 'ambivalently teetering on the border of
post-settler colonialism' and 'evidence Australia's attempts to
reconcile its settler-colonial past'.36

#### Hybrid understandings of land are a prerequisite to decolonization. Engaging with the state is good and key.

B. Ontological Hybridity: Double-Consciousness by a New Name

In any game, the rules constitute both the game itself and the players'
roles. The rules may assume values or facts about the universe and may
give such assumptions material weight in the context of the game. The
rules constrict player freedom and set the terms of victory, and players
must fashion themselves after the rules to win. But what if the rules
change the players' self-conception, change who they are and how they
think outside the bounds of the game? What if the game reaches out and
changes how the players engage with the universe?

Forced participation in foreign legal, social, and economic systems does
precisely this. Over time, participants internalize the values and
beliefs of these systems. The rules we live by affect our
self-consciousness. They shape how we interact with each other, and how
we understand our place in the universe.

[An essential dimension of colonization is ontological and epistemic
hegemony. [Indigenous]{.mark} participation in colonial structures,
whether to assert rights or even sovereign claims within the colonial
framework, can further this process. The result is a psychological harm:
the dissonance between silenced Indigenous ontologies and a
universalizing Western worldview. As ICC Alaska recorded in its
study:]{.underline}

[[Participants]{.mark} express that it often [feel]{.mark}s like they
are being [spoken down to]{.mark}, **[rather than engaged in discussions
between equal comanagement partners]{.mark}**. That is a byproduct of
law, government interpretations of the law, and a feeling of lack of
respect for distinct cultural characteristics and ways of life,
I\[ndigenous\] K\[nowledge\], and expertise.]{.underline} 227

The harm is both personal and cultural---disrespect based on identity
and experience. This ICC Alaska observation evokes a critical body of
indigeneity theory, which names the colonization of science and reminds
us that ontologies and epistemologies have political context. As Tuhiwai
Smith describes, "the Western academy which claims theory as thoroughly
Western . . . has constructed all the rules by which the indigenous
world has been theorized," such that "theorizing our own existence and
realities is not something which many indigenous people assume is
possible."228

The colonization of theory is a form of disempowerment. [Settler
institutions determine fundamental facts of the universe and subsequent
methods of knowing, biased by settler experience and goals.]{.underline}
As Tuhiwai Smith remarks, "\[Indigenous people\] are not the final
arbiters of what really counts as the truth."229 Dispossession in this
theoretical register is tied to dispossession in the physical world. In
Decolonization is Not a Metaphor, Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang describe
this intellectual colonization as one dimension of the very material
project to displace and disappear Indigenous peoples:

Land is what is most valuable, contested, required. This is both because
the settlers make Indigenous land their new home and source of capital,
and also because the disruption of Indigenous relationships to land
represents a profound epistemic, ontological, cosmological violence.230

For Tuck and Yang, [the ontological and epistemic displacement is an
attribute of physical displacement. Conversely, [any meaningful
decolonization of the mind]{.mark} necessarily [demands decolonization
of the land:]{.mark} namely the [return of "sovereign" control over
Indigenous lands to Indigenous people]{.mark}.]{.underline}231

Theorists of "Indigenous political ecologies" focus on this issue as
well. As Beth Rose Middleton writes, [Indigenous political ecology would
necessarily feature "attention to decolonizing processes that explicitly
dismantle systems of internalized and externalized colonial
praxis."]{.underline}232 [Such processes include the rejection of
Western frameworks "by reaffirming the existence of much longer-standing
indigenous relationships with the land,"233 extricating political
ecology from its distinctly Western materialist theoretical setting, and
instead situating questions of political economy in Indigenous
cosmologies and law.]{.underline}234

Even as theorists work to decolonize the academy, Indigenous activists
and advocates still face the reality of colonial institutions that
refuse to listen to Indigenous assertions without translation. Pragmatic
participation is a necessity. As Kimberlé Crenshaw advises, critical
practice often requires passing over purity for the sake of progress.
While we should be concerned with law's function of legitimating certain
existing institutional arrangements, we should not write off law as a
hopeless, useless tool.235 Instead, movements should work to
strategically utilize institutional logic to their own ends:

[\[P\]opular struggles are a reflection of institutionally determined
logic and a challenge to that logic. **People [can only demand change in
ways that reflect]{.mark} the [logic of the institutions they are
challenging]{.mark}**. [Demands for]{.mark} change that do not reflect
the institutional logic---that is, demands [that do not engage]{.mark}
and subsequently reinforce the dominant ideology---[will]{.mark}
probably [be ineffective]{.mark}.]{.underline}236

[To be effective, movements must engage with dominant logics and
ideologies. [If Indigenous groups are to succeed within the borders of
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [they must]{.mark}**, to some
degree,** [participate in the American legal regime.]{.mark} The key is
"to devise ways to wage ideological and political struggle while
minimizing the costs of engaging in an inherently legitimating
discourse."]{.underline}237 [In the case of Inuit food sovereignty, ICC
Alaska seeks to [engage with the American regulatory state to assert
power over material resources while resisting]{.mark} the [expansion of
colonization in the ontological register]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In Unsettling the Land, Burow, Brock, and Dove describe such a [strategy
for Indigenous groups, one that uses settler institutions to revitalize
Indigenous land-based practices and ultimately affirms Indigenous
ontologies.]{.underline}238 [They propose [hybridity as]{.mark} the
[guiding principle, namely in]{.mark} the [multiple modalities of
land---land-as-property alongside Indigenous
conceptions.]{.mark}]{.underline}239 This hybridity is a kind of double
consciousness in theory and in practice. [It manifests as the
partnership of land-as-property legal claims and the land-based
practices such claims enable.]{.underline}240 [This approach was [born
of **pragmatism**]{.mark}: [settler state institutions cannot be
circumvented in the assertion of tribal
sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline}241 [Settler institutions only
recognize land-as-property, so [tribal nations must speak the language
of property relations and ownership]{.mark}.]{.underline} To minimize
the ontological harm, to prevent the adoption of Western conceptions of
land at the expense of Indigenous understandings, the same tribal groups
must practice independent, traditional relations with land. As the
authors assert, ["land-based practices are [essential to]{.mark}
[rework]{.mark}ing the very [notion of land underpinning settler
colonial domination]{.mark}. Settler modes of thinking about the land
are being appropriated to take the land back while other modes of
thinking are being practiced."]{.underline}242 Land-based practices are
the mechanism for thinking and living in Indigenous frames. [This method
requires a tolerance for dissonance and a willingness to operate in a
tenuous space, the "[nexus where different modalities of land
coexist]{.mark}, often uneasily or in conflict with each
other."]{.underline}243 [In other words, **that nexus** [is the]{.mark}
[space of decolonization]{.mark}.]{.underline}244

In identifying this need for ontological hybridity, the authors
challenge common assumptions of critical environmental disciplines.
[They take issue with the Western Marxian approach to land featured in
peasant studies and political ecology, and they assert that in the
colonial context, "\[t\]he 'original sin' that precedes the extraction
of economic value is more than the alienation of workers from the means
of production: it is the alienation of Indigenous ontologies by settler
modes of thinking and controlling land."]{.underline}245 Once this
"original sin" is recognized, the need for work on the ontological
register is evident. To the authors, ["[decolonial praxis]{.mark} is
[premised on]{.mark} the [ability to revitalize Indigenous ontologies
through grounded practices]{.mark}."]{.underline}246 [Of course, those
grounded practices are bound to be distinctive for different Indigenous
Peoples.]{.underline}

This kind of dual approach is comparable to the ICC Alaska framework for
food sovereignty and self-governance. Obviously, [the proposal to
partner with existing regulatory agencies to manage Inuit resources is a
pragmatic move---one that recognizes the limits of political feasibility
in the United States.]{.underline} Like Crenshaw, [the ICC Alaska Report
authors appear to make use of existing institutional logic.]{.underline}
But this pragmatic proposal is simultaneously radical in its
aspirations. From the outset, the authors note that "Inuit cultural
values can be undermined during the co-management process," and they
criticize co-management schemes that subordinate Inuit worldviews.247 By
framing food security as a matter of cultural, spiritual, and linguistic
survival, they subvert settler conceptions of ecological resources.
Meanwhile, their rejection of the MMPA's single-species approach in
favor of an interdependent multi-species approach affirms Inuit
understandings of ecological health. This implicit embrace of hybridity
can be found in the initial framing of the report, when ICC Alaska
addresses the term "subsistence." The report states:

\[Subsistence\] does not capture the multiple social, cultural,
economic, and spiritual dimensions of Inuit food security. Throughout
this report, the term "subsistence" is only used in reference to
federal/state/territorial laws. The term food security is more
frequently used to capture the multifaceted nature of food described by
Inuit.248

Through this note on word choice, ICC Alaska highlights the distance
between the state's term and its connotations and that of the Inuit
authors. They do not reject the term outright, but delineate its
limited, pragmatic use for interfacing with the American legal system.
Having set this tool aside, they proceed to articulate an Inuit
conception of food security.

While the Report recognizes a need for translation and cooperation, it
consciously rejects ontological and epistemic hegemony. [It observes a
distinction between Indigenous Knowledge and settler science:
"[IK]{.mark} [and science]{.mark} [are]{.mark} two [distinct]{.mark}
knowledge systems. With this in mind, it is important not to force or
interpret IK into science, but instead [allow the two]{.mark} sources of
information [to work]{.mark} in coordination [with each
other]{.mark}."]{.underline}249 [In other words, these worldviews should
both be used, but one cannot assimilate the other.]{.underline}

Finally, the use of Inuit languages is an essential method to affirm
Inuit ontologies while operating in the structures of American
regulation. Indigenous language offers preferred lenses, connotations,
and nuances that can work to preserve Indigenous approaches. As ICC
Alaska states:

[The importance of using Inuit dialects, the pain of lost language
(violently taken away through boarding and government-funded schools and
forced cultural assimilation), and the ability to speak from truth
through one's own language was expressed through every focus group
meeting, workshop, and expert interview.]{.underline}250

Language is both a major dimension of cultural survival and a way to
honor past suffering. Resisting translation and sharing Native languages
is an important means to maintaining ontological hybridity in a colonial
legal regime.

In all these ways, ICC Alaska models the kind of multidimensional
thought and practice essential to the work of decolonization. This
dedication to ontological hybridity coupled with the demand for a shift
in power relations can protect Native communities from the pitfalls of
shallow co-management. If these criteria are feasible, true
co-management can be achieved.

#### Climate change makes dependence on the government a [necessity]{.underline} for Indigenous survival\-\--only debating out the [hard choices]{.underline} associated with burden sharing and extraction can protect Indigenous futures.

[Indigenous peoples have the **right to internal
self-determination**]{.underline}, that is, the right to 'freely
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic,
social and cultural development'. 56 Currently, this right is
interpreted within the traditional Western understanding that sees
self-determination as jurisdictional rights over people and territory.
57 [Land]{.underline} thereby [provides a geographical basis for
collective self-determination]{.underline} as it creates a bounded
sphere in which personal and collective autonomy and freedom can be
exercised. Jurisdictional territories rely on a form of land rights that
allow a community to be free from outside interference. They thereby can
shape their laws and ways of life in a self-determined manner. Yet,
[climate change leads to a situation in which Indigenous
self-determination is restricted even if there is no explicit political
interference]{.underline} from the outside. One reason for this is that
[climate change]{.underline} often [makes it **impossible** for
Indigenous peoples to pursue their traditional land-based
occupations]{.underline}. In Canada, for example, 30% to 80% of all
production and income in Indigenous communities stem from subsistence
economy, with especially high percentages in Northern regions. 58 If
climate change makes it impossible to uphold these subsistence
economies, Indigenous peoples often have little choice but to enter the
cash economy of the settler state with all its associated logics.

Often, [this means]{.underline} that [Indigenous peoples are **forced to
open their territories to resource exploitation to earn
money**]{.underline}. 59 [Once they do]{.underline} so, [it becomes
harder]{.underline} for them [to live in accordance with and preserve
their own values as the community]{.underline} now [**has to conform**
to the dominant ethnogeography which]{.underline} the [external actors
bring]{.underline} onto the land. For many Indigenous peoples,
self-determination is not just sovereignty in political matters
concerning humans but includes the maintenance of relations and
reciprocal duties with land and non-human beings that live on the land.
60 Taking responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of these
relationships and the fulfillment of the associated duties is a core
element of the Indigenous understanding of their self-determination. 61
Yet, [as Indigenous peoples become dependent on income from resource
extraction, their capability of fulfilling their duties towards the
land]{.underline} often [decreases as they surrender
control]{.underline} over land [to external actors whose land use and
ontologies conform to the settler ethnogeography of land]{.underline}.

**[If there is no resource exploitation to provide income, Indigenous
people]{.underline}** often **[need to rely on government
programs]{.underline}** to support their community members and ensure
that basic needs are met. In order to receive the needed support,
[they]{.underline} frequently [must **give up elements of their
self-determination** in]{.underline} order [to comply with government
conditions or]{.underline} to [fit into the schemes of government
programs]{.underline}. In the worst case, [Indigenous lands become
uninhabitable]{.underline}, for example, because of flooding, and the
communities depend on the state to relocate them. 62 The necessary
[climate]{.underline}-change [adaptation programs rarely are tailored to
Indigenous communities' values and]{.underline} needs and [often give
them little say in how]{.underline} the [adaptation can be realized in
such a way that the communal structures]{.underline} necessary for
effective self-government [can be preserved]{.underline}. 63 Traditional
governance structures might be undermined and communities torn apart,
for example, through relocation or conflicts in the face of poverty. 64

Consequently, [climate change creates a situation in which Indigenous
peoples are **forced to integrate** into the settler-state
ethnogeography]{.underline} -- either [by being coopted into the market
economy that focuses on exploiting land and resources or by becoming
dependent on state help]{.underline} which requires them to act in
accordance with the dominant ethnogeography. Thus, even if the settler
state does not explicitly interfere with the jurisdictional rights of
Indigenous peoples, climate change creates a framework in which
Indigenous peoples' self-determination is severely restricted or even
becomes impossible: '\[F\]or Indigenous peoples, the consequences of
giving in to external logics concerning the planning or control of their
territories often leads to extreme poverty, to an acceleration of the
depredation of their natural resources, to dispossession of their
collective heritage and, in many cases, to the break up or even forced
abandonment of their territorial space'. 65 [Climate
change]{.underline}, however, ma[kes it increasingly difficult for
indigenous peoples to resist]{.underline} these [external logics **even
if they have all the negative consequences described**]{.underline}.

This development contrasts starkly with the kind of self-determination
many Indigenous peoples envision in a decolonial context. For many
Indigenous peoples, self-determination in the context of decolonization
is closely connected to resurgence. Borrows and Tully explain:

> Resurgence is often used to refer to Indigenous peoples exercising
> powers of self-determination outside of state structures and
> paradigms. It is deployed by com- munities as a force for reclaiming
> and reconnecting with traditional territories by means of Indigenous
> ways of knowing and being. These individual and collective powers
> include the resurgence of governance, Indigenous legal systems and
> languages, economic and social self-reliance, and sustainable
> relationships with the ecosystems that co-sustain all life and
> well-being. 66

It stands out that self-determination is to take place 'outside of state
structures and paradigms'. This connects to the earlier discussion of
decolonization as making Indigenous ethnogeographies possible again
through land-based practices, economic self-sufficiency, and the
development of a 'grounded normativity'. 67 Now it has become clear that
climate change counteracts this objective by forcing Indigenous peoples
to integrate into the structures of the settler society as their land
degrades. Thus, [the dominance of the settler ethnogeography in
mainstream society together with climate change **weakens the chances of
de facto Indigenous self-determination** even if they possess the right
to internal self-governance by law]{.underline}.

4.2. Protecting Indigenous Self-determination under Climate Change

As climate change increases, [internal self-determination rights become
**increasingly insufficient** for ensuring effective Indigenous
self-determination]{.underline}. Rebecca Tsosie takes up this insight
and contrasts sovereignty claims and environmental self-determination
claims. 68 [Sovereignty claims concentrate on]{.underline} Indigenous
peoples' [formal political and legal autonomy which allows]{.underline}
them full [control over]{.underline} their [land and
resources]{.underline} without state interference. Here 'equality of
status as governments \[is\] key to justice'. 69 Sovereignty claims are
a counter-reaction to the traditional forms of colonialism which seek to
appropriate Indigenous land and erase Indigenous sovereignty. They rely
on the assumption that as long as Indigenous peoples are shielded from
government interference, they will be able to rebuild their own
societies and decide their future autonomously. However, as the above
discussion has shown, [climate change prevents Indigenous peoples from
becoming self-determining and]{.underline} instead [makes them more
dependent on the settler state and its structures]{.underline}. As a
solution, Tsosie suggests supplementing sovereignty rights with
environmental self-determination claims. 70 The latter focus on
involvement in decision-making on national and international levels when
it comes to decisions that affect Indigenous peoples and their lands.
Such [environmental self-determination claims become more pressing as
climate change advances and decisions about]{.underline} its potential
[mitigation are taken]{.underline}. Despite Indigenous peoples'
heightened vulnerability due to climate change, many policies that
impact Indigenous peoples and their land through their impact on climate
change are largely decided without the participation of Indigenous
peoples. 71

This [exclusion from international and national decision-making
processes means]{.underline} that [Indigenous peoples are **denied a
voice in decisions that directly affect them and their**]{.underline}
capability of [**self-determination**. It]{.underline} thereby
**[replicates]{.underline}** two [**colonial wrongs** that internal
self-governance rights were supposed to remedy]{.underline}. First, it
means that [Indigenous peoples are deprived of the preconditions for
self-determination and are]{.underline} instead [forced to
assimilate]{.underline} to the mainstream culture and ethnogeography.
Second, [it puts Indigenous peoples in a position of being dominated by
other actors]{.underline}. Relations of domination have been one of the
core wrongs of colonialism. Ypi, for example, locates the specific wrong
of colonialism 'in the creation and upholding of a political association
that denies its members equal and reciprocal terms of cooperation'. 72
Internal self-determination does not suffice to undo these unequal terms
of cooperation. [The idea of internal self-governance rights as a
decolonization tool **relies on the assumption that coop**eration **with
the settler state is unnecessary**]{.underline}, and thus equality is
restored by cutting relations. The previous sections have shown that
such an assumption is misleading in times of climate change.

[**Climate change necessitates land and resource sharing and thus
coop**eration]{.underline}. Moreover, climate change makes us realize
that [at least in environmental terms **we cannot disentangle ourselves
from others**. What one actor does to the environment affects
others]{.underline} that share this environment. This is why, for
example, Dobson calls for a concept of ecological citizenship which
assigns duties to regulate behavior in such a way that the global
ecological effects of policies are accounted for.73 Therefore,
[political orders that focus on letting actors take decisions without
taking into account]{.underline} the [externalities]{.underline} imposed
on others [can]{.underline} easily [turn the nevertheless existent
relations into deeply unequal ones]{.underline}. Thus, **[internal
self-determination alone cannot cure the unequal relations of colonial
times]{.underline}**. Even more, [such a way of rectifying the colonial
wrong of denying self-determination and subjecting Indigenous peoples to
colonial rule ignores and conflicts with the Indigenous notions of
self-determination. Indigenous authors]{.underline} often [define
self-determination as consisting of rules that **govern** and **enable
equal and reciprocal relations**]{.underline} in which
[interdependence]{.underline} on various levels [is acknowledged and
honored]{.underline}.74 Ladner, for example, highlights that 'Many
Indigenous political traditions conceive of governance as the absence of
power (coercive, hierarchical and authoritative) relations and as a
relationship among the people of a nation and between all peoples (human
and non-human) within a territory'.75 Similarly, Kuokkanen states that
'For Indigenous peoples, self-determination is about a vision and
struggle for restructuring relations of domination for a more just
present and future for their societies and people'.76

Thus, in the area of self-determination climate change again brings to
light how Indigenous and Western conceptions drift apart and how
[rectification of colonial injustices that occur in a predominantly
Western framework **cannot effectively help decolonization**. For
decolonization to take place, it must be recognized that
self-determination **means more than just**]{.underline} having
**[jurisdictional rights]{.underline}** over a certain area. [It
requires standing in relations of equality that allow independence by
acknowledging interdependence]{.underline}.77 Whereas these differing
approaches to self-determination might not have openly conflicted in a
world in which actions of one collective only had very limited effects
on other territories, this is no longer the case. Climate change shows
that [**it is not possible anymore to govern relations within a
specified territory without also influencing other territories**. As
relations extend, governance also must extend]{.underline} to cover
these relations and to structure them in a just and equal manner. In the
current world, a first step towards this goal is to grant the
environmental self-determination claims that Tsosie describes.78 These
claims react to the fact that decisions taken outside Indigenous
jurisdictional territories deeply affect these territories. They would
give Indigenous people a more equal standing in shaping their future
environment instead of being at the mercy of other actors. For such
claims to become possible, Indigenous peoples would have to be
recognized as political actors with a standing equal to that of other
states.79 That is, the 'equal' relation on a nation-to-nation basis
within settler states would have to be extended to the international
order. Indigenous peoples' exclusion from or marginal position in
international bodies would thereby be remedied.

In addition, the notion of self-determination employed in the currently
dominant discourse and the institutions meant to safeguard it would need
reformation as well. While climate change has spurred states into
coordinating collective action, such joint action is not yet seen as a
part of national self-determination. So far, states can freely decide
whether to join or abstain from climate actions such as the Paris
Agreement. [Abstaining is not seen as a direct violation of]{.underline}
the [self-determination]{.underline} claims of others, while forcing
states to comply would be seen as such a violation. [The reason is that
self-determination is still couched in terms of non-interference in
internal matters instead of in terms of structuring relations of
equality that allow all to pursue their own ways of life within the
boundaries set by the shared ecological environment]{.underline}. Having
equal access to the current international institutions and
decision-making bodies therefore is only one part in ensuring the
preconditions for Indigenous self-determination. Additionally, it
requires that the international system and its guiding norms and
concepts are reformed so as to balance the environmental interests and
needs of all actors justly.

The points about reforms of the international system extend to the
national level. [Given that Indigenous peoples that are harmed by
climate-change effects usually turn first to the surrounding state for
help or for alternative occupations, it is crucial that this move into
closer relations with the settler state is not identical with a move
into a society that subordinates Indigenous ontologies]{.underline} and
ethnogeographies. Section 4.1 has discussed how such subordination into
the settler ethnogeography currently happens. To counter this
development, [it is necessary that Indigenous voices and knowledge are
**treated as equals** in deciding on climate adaptation and mitigation
programs on the national level and **that the settler state's role in
causing climate change is appropriately reflected when burdens are
distributed**]{.underline}.

#### Indigenous people want better benefit sharing programs 

**Emma, 19 **\[Wilson, 4-20-2019, "What is Benefit Sharing? Respecting
Indigenous Rights and Addressing Inequities in Arctic Resource
Projects." MDPI, <https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74> accessed 7-14

**[[Indigenous]{.mark} and local [communities are]{.mark} increasingly
[calling for more equitable benefit sharing by the extractive
industries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [alongside the effective management
of environmental and social risks of industrial activity.]{.underline}
Within international law, the concept of 'fair and equitable benefit
sharing' is increasingly accepted as a norm in a range of sectors,
including the extractive industries \[1\]. For the purposes of this
paper, the term 'benefit sharing' encompasses taxation and revenue
distribution, job creation, ownership of companies and shares,
negotiated agreements and community development programmes. The paper
focuses in particular on the benefits that accrue to local, especially
Indigenous, communities directly affected by resource development.
Benefit sharing is not an isolated process and should be considered
alongside local and Indigenous rights to land and resources, project
impact mitigation, and compensation arrangements. Benefit sharing is
distinct from compensation (although there may be overlaps in practice)
and relates to broader questions of equitable development. This paper
focuses primarily on the Arctic (and sub-Arctic) context, building on a
steadily increasing amount of scholarship related to various aspects [of
benefit sharing [in Arctic resource development]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[2,3,4,5,6,7,8\].

The paper highlights a key aspect of benefit sharing that has been
under-explored in scholarship and neglected in practice to date, namely
the role of Indigenous peoples in strategic planning. The term
'strategic planning' refers, inter alia, to the development of national
policies, plans, programmes and strategies for resource development and
benefit distribution; and the allocation of lands for resource
exploration and extraction, including resource mapping and land-use
zoning at the national level or within local area plans \[9,10\].
Indigenous peoples' right to participate in decision-making and
determine priorities at this stage of planning is written into
international Indigenous rights instruments (see Section 3.1). The lack
of influence of Indigenous peoples over these crucial planning stages
results in a resource development model that is controlled by the state
and economic players that are external to local Indigenous communities,
commonly resulting in less than equitable benefit-sharing outcomes for
those communities \[11\] (see Section 3.3 and Section 3.4).

At the national level, benefits from resource projects are expected to
derive from taxation and revenue distribution, job creation,
project-related infrastructure and social services, and various
multiplier effects such as the growth of secondary industries and
increased purchasing power \[12,13\]. Governments are responsible for
setting legislation and regulations related to the above, while
benefit-sharing may also be managed by state-owned companies.
Governments are also responsible for land agreements and treaties, which
may determine local and Indigenous rights to negotiate benefits. They
also set requirements for consultation around government policies,
plans, programmes and strategies that relate to the environment and
those that directly affect Indigenous peoples (see Section 3.1).
Governments may also establish sovereign wealth funds, such as Norway's
Oil Fund, or sub-national funds, such as the Alaska Permanent Fund
\[14,15\]. Community-level benefit sharing is mandated by government
legislation in some countries, but the detail and content of these
regulations vary greatly \[16\].

[Yet [the people who experience]{.mark} most of [the direct]{.mark}
environmental and social [costs of extractive projects]{.mark}---many of
whom are Indigenous---frequently [**fail to benefit** from]{.mark} the
so-called 'ripple effect' of [revenue distribution]{.mark} and job
creation]{.underline} \[17\]. [[They may not receive]{.mark} many of the
[tax payments]{.mark} or [revenues generated by projects]{.mark}, while
local workers and businesses may not have the skills or experience---or
indeed the desire---to compete for jobs and contracts]{.underline}
\[6\]. [This imbalance of costs and benefits is compounded by the
unpredictable nature of commodity markets and the impacts on communities
of economic slumps or sudden project closures]{.underline} \[18,19,20\].
[**[Inadequate]{.mark}** or poorly-managed [benefit-sharing can lead
to]{.mark} the **[breakdown of trust]{.mark}**, to [social tension or
even conflict]{.mark}, [threatening the success of projects]{.mark},
company profits and the ability of governments to meet policy goals
\[21,22\]. The [disempowerment]{.mark}, 'voicelessness' [and lack of
agency]{.mark} of Indigenous, poor and marginalized people [have]{.mark}
long [been identified as key]{.mark} [factors in]{.mark} the failure of
[extractive industries]{.mark} to have positive development outcomes
\[12,23\].]{.underline}

Benefit sharing in Arctic (and sub-Arctic) extractive industries has
traditionally been driven by state-owned companies in the context of
colonial and neo-colonial type approaches to extractive industry
development \[24,25\]. Where the company itself is not state-owned, the
state may still play a significant role in benefit sharing. Across the
Arctic and sub-Arctic region, the role of the government (nationally and
regionally) varies greatly, which is partly a reflection on the relative
size of the countries and their contrasting governance regimes \[8,26\].
Tysiachniouk and Petrov identify four modes of benefit sharing in the
Arctic: (1) 'paternalistic mode' (a mode dominated by the state); (2)
'company centred social responsibility (CCSR) mode' (a mode in which the
company takes a more decisive role); (3) 'partnership mode' (bi-lateral
partnerships between communities and companies, or tri-lateral
partnerships involving government); and (4) 'shareholder mode' (a mode
in which local communities own shares in mineral projects and in the
companies exploiting the resources) \[8\]. Writing about Canada, Coates
and Crowley \[24\] (p. 20) state:

While there is no single model of resource and economic development that
has or will work in Aboriginal communities across the country; [**[it
is]{.mark} increasingly [clear]{.mark} that most [Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} [are open to partnership approaches]{.mark}.**
[Collaboration makes sense for Aboriginal people]{.mark}, communities,
companies, governments and Canada at large.]{.underline}

In an analysis of international law that specifically seeks to clarify
the concept of benefit sharing, Morgera recognizes the iterative and
dialogic nature of the concept as established in international legal
instruments \[1\] (p. 364):

\[B\]enefit sharing differs from the unidirectional (top-down) flows of
benefits and, rather, aims at developing a common understanding of what
the benefits at stake are and how they should be shared. [In this
connection, it has been argued that benefit sharing is geared towards
consensus building. It entails an iterative process, rather than a
one-off exercise, of good-faith engagement among different actors that
lays the foundation for a partnership among them.]{.underline}

**[In Morgera's analysis '[partnership' refers to]{.mark} '[an approach
to accommodate]{.mark} state sovereignty over natural [sovereignty and
indigenous peoples' self-determination']{.mark}]{.underline}** \[1\] (p.
364). [[This balance]{.mark}---particularly between state sovereignty
and Indigenous peoples' self-determination---[lies at the heart]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} current [efforts to ensure equitable benefit sharing]{.mark}
in the context of extractive industry activity that takes place on
Indigenous peoples' lands.]{.underline}

[The former UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,
James Anaya, identified the 'standard' or 'prevailing' model of resource
development, driven by economic actors external to the local Indigenous
community, which frequently fails to deliver adequate benefits to local
Indigenous communities \[11\].]{.underline} [He contrasted this with a
'[preferred' model, based on **greater levels of Indigenous control over
the nature of the development and the sharing of the benefits**]{.mark},
emphasizing in particular the Indigenous right to 'determine priorities
and strategies for the development or use of their lands and
territories' according to Article 32 of UNDRIP \[11\]]{.underline} (see
Section 3.3). [Elsewhere, the 'prevailing' model of resource development
has been termed 'extractivism' \[27,28\], and has been contrasted to
Indigenous relations with the natural environment, based more on
partnership, respect and entitlement through 'knowing' rather than
'owning' the resources \[29,30\]. Anaya's 'preferred' model corresponds
to Tysiachniouk and Petrov's 'shareholder' mode, while [also]{.mark}
envisioning [greater]{.mark} [Indigenous control over decision-making,
including strategic planning]{.mark} (see Section 4). The notion of
'Indigenous control' also extends to decision-making about whether or
not a project goes ahead. In cases where Indigenous peoples do not own
the mineral resources in question, this requires a process of free,
prior and informed consent (FPIC) before key development decisions are
made \[11\].]{.underline}

[A [growing awareness of]{.mark} the [lack of fairness]{.mark} or equity
in the standard resource development model [is]{.mark} now [compelling
Indigenous communities to urge governments]{.mark} and companies
[to]{.mark}: (a) ascertain how communities envision their future in
relation to extractive industries, and whether or not they want resource
development to take place on their lands; and (b) to [ensure appropriate
decision-making powers and adequate benefit
sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}, if developments are to take place
\[7,31,32\]. This is supported in international standards---notably the
International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No.169 on Indigenous
and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO 169, 1989) and the
United Nations (UN) Declaration on the [Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(UNDRIP, 2007), which refer, inter alia, to the right of Indigenous
peoples to decide their own priorities and to exercise control over
their own development; yet, as Anaya has pointed out, this particular
Indigenous right is rarely respected in practice]{.underline} \[11\]
(see Section 3.1 and Section 3.3).

#### Native Alaskans want more oil & minerals.

**Bohrer 23**, \*statehouse and political reporter based in Juneau,
Alaska. (Becky Bohrer, 2-14-2023, \"Alaska Native leaders, US senators
back major oil project\", AP News,

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) --- Alaska's Republican U.S. senators and
[**several** [Alaska Native leaders]{.mark} on Tuesday
[urged]{.mark}]{.underline} [the federal government to approve [a major
**oil project**]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the petroleum-rich [North
Slope]{.mark}]{.underline}, [casting the project as **economically
[critical]{.mark}** [for Indigenous communities]{.mark} in the region
and important for the nation's **energy security**]{.underline}.

The Biden administration "damn well better not kill the project,
period," Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters on a video conference.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management earlier this month released an
environmental review for ConocoPhillips Alaska's Willow project that
listed as a preferred alternative an option calling for up to three
drill sites initially, compared to the five that had been favored by the
company. It is an option project proponents, including Alaska's
bipartisan congressional delegation, have expressed support for. But
Murkowski and Sen. Dan Sullivan said any further limiting of the project
could kill it.

The Bureau of Land Management noted its listing of a preferred
alternative "does not constitute a commitment or decision." The U.S.
Interior Department said separately that it had "substantial concerns"
about the project and the report's preferred alternative, "including
direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions and impacts to wildlife and
Alaska Native subsistence." The Bureau of Land Management falls under
Interior.

There is disagreement about the project. Leaders in Nuiqsut, about 36
miles (58 kilometers) from the Willow project, have expressed concerns.
So have environmentalists, who say approval would lead to further
development and be inconsistent with President Joe Biden's climate
goals.

Sullivan has said [Willow could be "one of the biggest, most important
resource development projects in]{.underline} our [state]{.underline}'s
[history]{.underline}." He last week urged state lawmakers in Alaska's
capital to pass a resolution expressing support for the project and to
get involved in litigation that is likely to arise from whatever
decision is rendered by the federal government. A decision could come in
early March.

[Taqulik [Hepa]{.mark}]{.underline}, director of the Department of
Wildlife Management for the North Slope Borough, [[said taxes]{.mark}
levied [on oil]{.mark} and gas [infrastructure]{.mark} have
[enabled]{.mark} the borough to [invest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} public
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**, support local **[schools]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} provide police, fire and [other
services]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Hepa said the borough and its [residents are "keenly aware of the need
to balance responsible oil development and the subsistence lifestyle
that has sustained us]{.underline}." She said the borough has demanded
this balance be achieved in its dealings with government agencies and
oil companies for decades.

[Nagruk Harcharek, president of the group [Voice of the Arctic
**Iñupiat**]{.mark}, whose members include leaders [from]{.mark} across
[much of]{.mark} the **[North Slope]{.mark}**, [said]{.mark} [there is
"**majority consensus**]{.mark}" in the region in favor of the project,
calling Willow a "lifeline" for residents. He said there are limited
economic development opportunities in the region, which makes approval
of the Willow project **important**.]{.underline}

Sullivan, in a speech on the U.S. Senate floor last week, said the
voices of those who support the project aren't being given enough
attention. He complained that national media outlets find "the one who's
against it and quote her."

City of Nuiqsut Mayor Rosemary Ahtuangaruak said there are "many who
would like to say everybody in Alaska supports oil and gas development.
Well, for our village, this development is in the wrong area."

"Our concerns are real. It's about our way of life, the life, health and
safety of our village," she said.

Biden earlier this month said the U.S. would need oil "for at least
another decade.″ Murkowski said there is a move to transition toward a
"different energy future" but said Biden needs to "recheck his facts,
respectfully."

"We are decades, decades away from a time that we would be beyond oil
resources," she said. "The need is very, very much still there."

She and Sullivan have said resource development should be done in places
with environmental standards like Alaska.

The proposed Willow project is in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.
ConocoPhillips Alaska has said it could produce up to 180,000 barrels of
oil a day at its peak. [It is [expected to create]{.mark} up to
[**2,500** jobs]{.mark} during construction and an estimated **300**
permanent jobs, along with generating [**billions** of dollars in
revenues]{.mark} for federal, state and local governments]{.underline},
the company has said.

[A small Native community in the remote North Slope borough of Alaska
has been at the center of debates in Washington, D.C., over bringing
"drill, baby, drill" to its backyard --- and it isn't completely against
the idea.]{.underline}

More than 3,000 miles northwest of Washington sits the small village of
Kaktovik, Alaska. With roots tracing back thousands of years, the
[Native residents have no intention of leaving and want to see their
people and village grow over the years. For most, that can't happen
without more drilling.]{.underline}

The people of Kaktovik

It's not easy to get to Kaktovik. The village is located on Barter
Island, more than 600 miles north of Anchorage, Alaska, and roughly 90
miles west of the Canadian border.

The secluded village of fewer than 300 residents is at the northern tip
of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. There is no main road connecting
the outpost to the rest of Alaska, and visitors can only access the
village by small plane or ship.

Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's Coastal Plain. (Nathan Gordon Jr.)

[Despite its remote location, Kaktovik is far from lacking modern
conveniences such as cable television, public electricity, public radio,
heated water, a health clinic, and even a trash pickup service. For
Mayor Nathan Gordon Jr., **the village has the fossil fuel industry to
thank.**]{.underline}

["Communities across the North Slope have long lacked basic
infrastructure other communities in the Lower 48 take for granted ---
including modern water and sewer systems and resilient
telecommunications networks," Gordon told the Washington
Examiner.]{.underline}

Gordon, who was born and raised in Kaktovik, explained that even as
recently as 20 years ago, many residents didn't have flushing toilets.

Kaktovik Mayor Nathan Gordon Jr. in Alaska's North Slope. (Nathan Gordon
Jr.)

[Kaktovik, like other villages and cities in the North Slope, relies
heavily on tax revenue generated by resource development projects such
as oil and gas drilling. In fact, more than 95% of North Slope Borough's
budget comes from this revenue.]{.underline}

Native leaders in the region said this has allowed smaller villages to
maintain modern sewer systems, build and repair schools, support a local
economy, and even lengthen their average life expectancy.

[Charles Lampe, who is Iñupiaq and was also born and raised in Kaktovik,
told the Washington Examiner their village's life expectancy has jumped
from 34 to 77 in just the last 60 years.]{.underline}

[As Kaktovik has seen immense economic and rural growth, leaders in the
village see a pathway for oil and gas projects to benefit them even
more.]{.underline}

[For example, the cost of living is extremely high in Kaktovik, as all
goods and services are brought to the region via small plane or barge.
As a result, basic items like a single ribeye steak sell for around \$35
to \$40. Gordon said he will buy a 24-pack of water for about
\$65.]{.underline}

[These high prices are seen across the North Slope. Data compiled by the
Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat and obtained by the Washington Examiner show
that a single gallon of whole milk in the region can cost as much as
\$14.99, and large packs of toilet paper as much as \$30 to
\$40.]{.underline}

[If Kaktovik were able to build a road system connecting the village to
the rest of Alaska, with funds generated by taxation on new energy
projects, those prices could fall dramatically.]{.underline}

["The industry has the money to help us be on the road system ... and I
believe that'd be the greatest help to the cost of living anywhere in
Alaska. The road system would cut freight in half," Gordon
said.]{.underline}

["I believe that the **best way to do it is through industry**, and the
industry needs to take care of their infrastructure, the pipeline, and
it'd be great for both of us," he added.]{.underline}

Why Alaska matters to Trump President Donald Trump and his
administration have had their sights set on Alaska as a resource for
increasing domestic oil and gas production for months. The 49th state is
widely recognized as being rich in natural resources, with the North
Slope Borough home to some of the largest oil and gas fields in the
United States. **[Alaska's energy sector accounts for roughly half of
the state's economy, thanks to direct and indirect jobs within the
fossil fuel industry as well as revenues from oil and gas
projects.]{.underline}** For years, administrations have disagreed on
how and when to create opportunities for increased drilling in the
state, particularly in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, or
NPR-A, and ANWR --- both located in the North Slope. Most existing
drilling projects in the region are located in and around the NPR-A.
There has been very little resource development in ANWR and its coastal
plain, in part due to restrictions on land use and available acreage
imposed under the Biden administration. Congress first authorized
drilling in ANWR in 2017, though little movement has been seen since.
During his first administration, Trump approved nine lease sales in
ANWR. The Biden administration ultimately suspended seven of these,
while two were canceled by bidding companies. The back-and-forth
illustrates the broader debate within the U.S. rooted in the energy
trilemma -- the challenge every nation faces in balancing energy equity,
energy security, and a transition to more sustainable sources of power.
Democrats and climate activists have urged fossil fuel companies to look
elsewhere for energy development, promoting more sustainable
alternatives and citing concerns over the impact new drilling projects
could have on the surrounding environment and wildlife. For Republicans,
however, Alaska's untapped resources are too good to be ignored,
particularly as electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data
centers is only expected to rise and threaten grid security if more
energy is not secured. A warning from others Not everyone who lives in
the North Slope is on board. The majority of energy development that has
already occurred in the North Slope has primarily been limited to the
NPR-A and regions near the oil-rich Prudhoe Bay, where the trans-Alaskan
pipeline system starts. One of these projects, known as the Willow
project, is located in the western region of NPR-A, near the city of
Nuiqsut. The project, led by ConocoPhillips, is estimated to produce
180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, generating as much as \$17
billion in new revenue for the state. Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, the former
mayor of Nuiqsut, told the Washington Examiner that ice roads created
for the project have since separated some caribou herds, threatening the
survival of young calves. She also pointed to past oil well blowouts
near the city, which caused emissions clouds to drift into the village.
As a result of the incidents, Ahtuangaruak claimed several residents
developed respiratory distress. "These are not things Kaktovik have gone
through, and when they are hidden from these adverse events, they don't
know the risk of what they're going through," Ahtuangaruak told the
Washington Examiner. "But we haven't been hidden from these risks. We
have lived through them in our village, and these are very different
observations about what we're going through." She admitted that there is
an important need to secure resources to heat their homes and support
rural development, but she indicated there needs to be greater care
taken to support and protect the surrounding communities from the risks
energy development can bring. "The reality is that the national energy
policy is ramping up the process to change the lands and waters where we
live, and the cumulative effect of all of this effort has caused
tremendous concern," she said. The state of play Since Trump took
office, his administration has taken several steps to open more acreage
of ANWR and the NPR-A up for additional oil and gas drilling, building
on an executive order signed on the first day of his presidency that
focused solely on unleashing Alaskan energy resources. Most recently,
the Department of the Interior announced it was rescinding a rule issued
by the Bureau of Land Management under the Biden administration that
aimed to keep 13 million acres of NPR-A off-limits to drilling
operations. The administration has also expressed interest in doubling
the amount of oil transported through the existing trans-Alaskan
pipeline and constructing the Alaska LNG pipeline, which would allow for
increased exports of liquefied natural gas from the North Slope to Asia.
The village of Kaktovik in the North Slope Borough of Alaska. (Voice of
the Arctic Iñupiat) The village of Kaktovik in the North Slope Borough
of Alaska. (Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat) During a visit to the state in
early June with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, Energy Secretary Chris
Wright said it would be "not a stretch at all" to quadruple the state's
energy production within the next 10 years. Congressional Republicans
have also moved to create a pathway for more energy development through
the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In this bill, Republicans included
provisions mandating lease sales in Alaska, particularly in the state's
Cook Inlet, NPR-A, and ANWR. While there is broad administration
support, Caleb Jasso, a senior policy adviser with the Institute for
Energy Research, said these results will likely still take some time due
to bureaucratic and investment constraints. "I would love to see within
this administration, you know, the shovel in the ground ... that would
be great. And I think that there's a positive direction for that, given
the push at the federal level, the openness of Alaska's governor and
various leaders," Jasso said. "There's definitely momentum in the right
direction compared to the past many years, but to give a specific
timeline, we would have to have more concrete pieces of understanding of
what exactly all this means." Others, including Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK),
are a bit more optimistic. Begich told the Washington Examiner that the
chances of Kaktovik getting a main road under the Trump administration
are "relatively high." As it moves forward, Native leaders in the North
Slope wish to ensure their voice remains at the table to help encourage
development when it is needed and rein it in when it may go too far.
TRUMP ENERGY OFFICIALS VISIT ALASKA IN BID TO UNLEASH STATE'S ENERGY
RESOURCES For Gordon and Lampe, the energy Cabinet members' visit to the
region was a step in the right direction as the members of the
administration held a town hall meeting with Native leaders and several
tribes in the northernmost part of the state.

["For generations, policymakers in Washington have made numerous
decisions about our land without consulting us, and outside groups with
no connection to the land regularly attempt to speak for us," Lampe told
the Washington Examiner. **"It is vital that our self-determination on
our homelands be respected by these outside groups and individuals and
that our people have a place at the policymaking table going
forward."**]{.underline}

#### Indigenous communities want a more equitable benefit-sharing system

**Wilson '19**, E. What is Benefit Sharing? Respecting Indigenous Rights
and Addressing Inequities in Arctic Resource
Projects. Resources 2019, 8, 74.
https://doi.org/10.3390/resources8020074

International standards refer to Indigenous peoples' right to benefit
from resource development, participate in decision-making and determine
priorities in development planning that directly affects them. While
good practice exists in benefit sharing, [[Indigenous peoples]{.mark}
still [lack opportunities for a meaningful role in strategic
planning]{.mark}.]{.underline} In his role as UN Special Rapporteur on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya identified a ['preferred
model' of resource development in which Indigenous peoples have greater
control over planning decisions and project implementation, and
consequently a more meaningful share of the benefits of resource
development.]{.underline} This paper explores the requirements of
international standards and guidance alongside different models of
benefit sharing in practice by extractive industries in Arctic and
sub-Arctic contexts. It is based primarily on desk-based analysis of
international hard and soft law and industry standards, while also
drawing on ethnographic field research in Russia and Norway. It
highlights good practice within mainstream development scenarios and
identifies [models of benefit sharing that represent a greater degree of
Indigenous participation and control.]{.underline} It concludes that
there is a need to consider benefit sharing within an overall paradigm
that allows greater space for Indigenous voices in decision making,
including at the strategic planning stage.

[Indigenous and local communities [are **increasingly calling for more
equitable benefit sharing by the extractive industries**]{.mark},
alongside the effective management of environmental and social risks of
industrial activity.]{.underline} Within international law, the concept
of 'fair and equitable benefit sharing' is increasingly accepted as a
norm in a range of sectors, including the extractive industries
\[[1](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B1-resources-08-00074)\].
For the purposes of this paper, the term 'benefit sharing' encompasses
taxation and revenue distribution, job creation, ownership of companies
and shares, negotiated agreements and community development programmes.
The paper focuses in particular on the benefits that accrue to local,
especially Indigenous, communities directly affected by resource
development. [[Benefit sharing is not an isolated process and should be
considered alongside local and Indigenous rights]{.mark} to land and
resources, project impact mitigation, and compensation
arrangements.]{.underline} Benefit sharing is distinct from compensation
(although there may be overlaps in practice) and relates to broader
questions of equitable development. This paper focuses primarily on the
Arctic (and sub-Arctic) context, building on a steadily increasing
amount of scholarship related to various aspects of benefit sharing in
Arctic resource development.

[The paper highlights a key aspect of benefit sharing that has been
under-explored in scholarship and neglected in practice to date, namely
the role of Indigenous peoples in strategic planning.]{.underline} The
term 'strategic planning' refers, inter alia, to the development of
national policies, plans, programmes and strategies for resource
development and benefit distribution; and the allocation of lands for
resource exploration and extraction, including resource mapping and
land-use zoning at the national level or within local area plans
\[[9](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B9-resources-08-00074),[10](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B10-resources-08-00074)\].
Indigenous peoples' right to participate in decision-making and
determine priorities at this stage of planning is written into
international Indigenous rights instruments (see [Section
3.1](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#sec3dot1-resources-08-00074)).
[[The lack of influence of Indigenous peoples]{.mark} over these crucial
planning stages [results in a resource development model that is
controlled by the state]{.mark} and economic players that are [external
to local Indigenous communities]{.mark}, commonly [resulting in less
than equitable benefit-sharing outcomes for those
communities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A growing awareness of the lack of fairness or equity in the standard
resource development model is now compelling Indigenous communities to
urge governments and companies to: (a) ascertain how communities
envision their future in relation to extractive industries, and whether
or not they want resource development to take place on their lands; and
(b) to ensure appropriate decision-making powers and adequate benefit
sharing, if developments are to take place
\[[7](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B7-resources-08-00074),[31](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B31-resources-08-00074),[32](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/2/74#B32-resources-08-00074)\].
This is supported in international standards---notably the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No.169 on Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples in Independent Countries (ILO 169, 1989) and the United Nations
(UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP, 2007),
which refer, inter alia, to the right of Indigenous peoples to decide
their own priorities and to exercise control over their own development;
yet, as Anaya has pointed out, this particular Indigenous right is
rarely respected in practice.

#### Tribes [say yes]{.underline}, and it is wrong to assume all natives are automatically opposed to extraction.

Resource extraction on Indigenous land involves \"a confrontation of two
laws: one oral and traditional and related in songs, stories\[,\] or
\[\] \[\*190\] paintings . . . the other written, negotiated\[,\] and
recorded far away from the lands themselves in cities and government
offices and at lawyers\' desks.\"213

[For Indigenous peoples, land rights entail]{.underline} \"**[more
than]{.underline}** a **[physical possession]{.underline}**.\"214 Land
rights intersect with material wellbeing. Thus, the \"close ties of
\[I\]ndigenous people with the land must be . . . understood as the
fundamental basis of their cultures, their spiritual life, their
integrity, and their economic survival.\"215 [There is no shortage of
cases in which resource extraction]{.underline}
\"[impede\[s\]]{.underline} \[Indigenous communities\'\] [access to
lands and natural resources]{.underline} critical to their physical
\[and spiritual\] well-being.\"216 [However, **scholars have cautioned
against assuming that Indigenous communities are a priori opposed to
resource extraction on their**]{.underline} ancestral
**[land]{.underline}**.217 [For some]{.underline} Indigenous
[communities, extractive industries are the **highest-paying employers**
and **providers of valuable educational opportunities**]{.underline}.218
[Indigenous opposition to resource development generally arises when
extractive projects are implemented on terms that are **unfavorable**
and **unjust**]{.underline}.

Since the inception of the United States, American Indians and [Alaska
Natives have been involved in a protracted battle against extractive
industries]{.underline}. Ideally, the federal government would allow
American Indian and Alaska Native tribes to be fully sovereign and
self-governing. [Promoting Indigenous self-determination is imperative
to fortifying]{.underline} \"[their role as custodians of]{.underline}
\[[**biod**iversity]{.underline}\] [and agents of]{.underline}
\[[social]{.underline}\] [change]{.underline}.\"219 However, the former
United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
predicts that \"for the foreseeable future\[,\] the financial and
technical capacity for the extraction of natural resources will largely
be in non-\[I\]ndigenous hands\[,\] and the political forces will
continue to empower the existing system of industry actors.\"220

In the meantime, [**coop**eration **is in the best interest of both
Indigenous peoples and the private sector**. For the private sector,
conflicts with Indigenous peoples affect more than just public
relations]{.underline}.221 [Rejecting Indigenous rights]{.underline} in
land and resource management [can cause]{.underline} \"[project delays
that increase operating costs]{.underline} as much as 29 times [and even
lead to outright]{.underline} \[\*191\] [abandonment of functional
operations]{.underline}.\"222 [For Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, the
experience of [negotiating]{.underline} a participation agreement
[**reinforces** the importance of **Indigenous models of
governance**]{.underline}.223 [Consultation is only the first step;
**real Indigenous governance requires jurisdiction**]{.underline}.224 To
that end, while recognizing the value of royalty payments, employment
preferences, and scholarships, the Harvard Project on American Indian
Economic Development concluded that the key to Indigenous prosperity
lies elsewhere, including Indigenous self-government.225

[Indigenous leaders\' stewardship practices offer key solutions for
maintaining **biod**iversity, mitigating climate change, and engendering
positive social change]{.underline} more broadly. As demonstrated by the
case studies above, [private companies in several countries have given
Indigenous peoples a seat at the table, and **the U**nited **S**tates
**should follow suit**]{.underline}. One Indigenous leader remarked,
\"When we are not invited to the table, it means we are on the
menu.\"226 [By engaging in meaningful negotiations that respect
territorial sovereignty, explore alternative approaches to resource
management, and ensure]{.underline} the [fair distribution of wealth
generated from extractive projects, **the adverse effects of resource
development can be alleviated**]{.underline}.

2\. Theoretical Framework: Envisioning Equitable Benefit-Sharing
Thorough Stakeholder and Shareholder Theories

In this study, shareholder and stakeholder theories are combined with
the theoretical insights from empirically-grounded research on
benefit-sharing. [Shareholders are holding sticks and receiving
dividends. Stakeholders include, but are not limited to state agencies,
non-governmental entities, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities.
Both shareholder and stakeholder theories represent a normative approach
to **corporate social responsibility** (CSR), highlighting what a good
practice of responsible business is.]{.underline} According to
shareholder theory, coined by Milton Friedman, the major duty of
business managers is to increase profits to legitimize the trust of
companies' investors and shareholders. Therefore, managers are morally
obliged to run the company to maximize shareholder profits because
shareholders have advanced capital to the company. However, these duties
can only be carried out through legal means and with a long-term
orientation \[27,28\]. Stakeholder theory adopts a broader lens,
acknowledging that firms bear the responsibility to both shareholders
and stakeholders. The major difference is that stakeholder theory argues
that the interests of all stakeholders have to be satisfied, even at the
expense of companies' profitability \[28,29\]. Contemporary managerial
theories highlight that the logic of companies' CSR is embedded in
interdependency between the stockholders and societal actors \[30\].
Scholars argue that shareholders are not the only investors; society is
also an investor in any business venture. Scholars distinguish between
two major categories of stakeholders: Interested, such as NGOs, for
example, and affected, e.g., local and/or indigenous communities that
experience harm or benefits from companies' operations \[31,32\]. [The
interests of stakeholders may contradict each nother; therefore,
stakeholder theory assumes that it will be necessary to prioritize and
make tradeoffs in efforts to satisfy stakeholders' desires \[33\]. By
responding to the demands of interested stakeholders, companies reduce
reputational risks and may make progress toward receiving a social
license to operate (SLO).]{.underline}

The concept of SLO appeared in the 1990s as companies were called to act
beyond legal compliance and address stakeholders' concerns and needs
\[9,10,11,12,13[\]. An oil or mining company would achieve an SLO when
its activities, performed in line with all requirements regarding
resource extraction, were viewed as acceptable by key social groups. An
important constituent of SLO is **benefit-sharing** \[14\].]{.underline}
In broad, metaphorical terms, stakeholder theory and the concept of SLO
emphasize the need for trust, legitimacy and credibility in
company-stakeholder relations \[15,16\]. At the same time, [the concept
of benefit-sharing is more tangible to addressing the needs of local
communities, that are experiencing impacts of resource
extraction.]{.underline}

[Benefit-sharing is defined as the distribution of monetary and
non-monetary benefits generated through a resource extraction activity
to affected stakeholders]{.underline} \[34,35\]. [Benefit-sharing can
imply transfers from companies in the form of tax payments, damage
compensation, royalty payments, dividends, or socio-economic
contracts]{.underline} \[35,36\]. [In some cases, the state can control
the process of benefit-sharing by means of sovereign wealth funds, land
lease agreements, obligatory social investments or voluntary company
initiatives]{.underline} \[37,38,39\]. [Benefit-sharing may appear
philanthropic because the funds support cultural festivities, languages
or sports, as well as strategic investments in education in subjects
important to the oil and gas industry in order to generate potential
employees of the company.]{.underline}

[Previous studies identified benefit-sharing regimes, that include
modes, principles and mechanisms.]{.underline} \[21\]. [Regimes
constitute a broad overreaching range of different kinds of formal and
informal relationships between companies and communities involving the
distribution of funds, as well as in-kind benefits. Regimes are embedded
in national legislation, companies' ownership and policies, practices in
use, historical legacies, opportunities for Indigenous Peoples'
involvement in decision making processes, and existing power dynamics in
communities.]{.underline}

[Modes of benefit-sharing refer to institutionalized forms of
interaction between oil companies, state agencies and communities around
the distribution of oil wealth. In our previous studies, we identified
several modes: Paternalism, company centered social responsibility
(CCSR), partnership, and **shareholder mode**]{.underline}
\[17,21,39,40\]. Empirically, it became apparent that [most
benefit-sharing practices are mixed and combine the characteristics of
several ideal types.]{.underline}

In the paternalistic ideal type, the state dominates in welfare
provision coming from oil money (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Paternalistic Mode of Benefit Sharing.

In CCSR, companies retain power and control over benefit-sharing
arrangements, which companies mostly set with stakeholders;
benefit-sharing is structured in a way that helps to avoid reputational
risks with NGOs and conflicts with local communities, investors and
shareholders. The partnership mode is based on a stakeholder approach,
in which social actors are seen as contributors to the companies'
wellbeing and vice versa \[33\] (see Figure 2).

Figure 2. Company Centered Social Responsibility Mode of Benefit
Sharing.

[The aim of the partnership is to foster self-reliance, empowerment and
community involvement in sharing oil benefits and costs. Indigenous
organizations, companies and the state agencies make joint decisions on
benefit-sharing]{.underline} (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. Partnership Mode of Benefit Sharing.

[The shareholder mode happens in Alaska, where every citizen receives
oil dividends every year from the state. Indigenous Peoples are
shareholders of native corporations and receive dividends from
them]{.underline} (see Figure 4). [The peculiarity of this case is that
Indigenous Peoples simultaneously are shareholders of a native
corporation and affected stakeholders whose traditional economic
activities may be damaged by extractive industries.]{.underline}
Finally, the beneficiary mode occurs primarily in Canada, where
community-based non-profit organizations manage oil money coming from
companies \[17,21,39,40\].

Figure 4. Shareholder Mode of Benefit Sharing.

These modes are rooted in several principles. [The principles define the
nature of benefits, such as compensation, investment, and
charity]{.underline} \[21\]. [Compensation for loss of pasture lands,
hunting grounds, or for irreversible impacts on traditional culture and
lifestyle is a principle, which law or state policy typically dictates
and stipulates possible collective socio-cultural or environmental costs
the community endured and the way in which a community will be
reimbursed. The investment principle involves building physical or
social infrastructure "voluntarily". Investment also can be in an
educational or community capacity building]{.underline} \[40,41\]. For
example, [investors can build roads, create new jobs for the residents,
and give stipends to Indigenous Peoples to study at Universities and
colleges. Charity principle entails sponsorship of cultural events,
festivals, and conferences among many others.]{.underline}

Finally, we distinguish the mechanisms of benefit-sharing arrangements.
[**Mandated mechanisms** are required by legislation or contracts.
Negotiated benefits represent a mechanism oil companies deliver to
communities as a result of negotiations. Semi-formal benefits involve
sponsorship as well as different kinds of goods and services that the
community gets upon request from the company. Trickle-down benefits are
those that automatically come to the community, along with
development]{.underline} \[17\]. Mechanisms of benefit-sharing have
unclear boundaries. For example, a certain degree of negotiations may be
involved in contracting, semi-formal agreements and even trickle-down
benefits.

[Mandated benefits are associated with specific acts of legislation or
regulation. Mandated benefits are often taxes and royalty payments to
the state or to the community in case the company is using federal,
state, or community land]{.underline} \[42\]. [Companies must pay taxes,
and tax distribution is based on national, regional, or local
legislation. Another typical example of mandated benefits is the Alaskan
permanent fund that distributes money from oil rent to every Alaskan
citizen, and the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act (ANCSA)
requirements; 70% of the money from resource extraction in the Alaska
Native Regional Corporations have to be shared with other regional
native corporations]{.underline} \[8\].

Negotiated benefits are an eclectic group of arrangements between
companies and regional, district, and municipal authorities, or between
companies and communities. For example, the impact benefit agreement
(ABI) that is common in Canada \[43\]. In Russia, the federal, or more
often, regional authorities imposed and negotiated socio-economic
cooperation agreements both formally and informally as a legacy of the
Soviet state practices \[19\]. The post-Soviet practice encompasses a
system where the extractive industry fulfils a part of the normal state
functions. The negotiation of benefits becomes centralized even though
the local government is active in requesting benefits from these
negotiations. This system gives little voice to the community, and
mostly serves the interests of the state in its interpretation of the
local needs \[19\]. Negotiated benefit-sharing happens when foreign
investors or partners impose requirements on lending entities. Regional
extractive companies may be open to such loans and partnerships in order
to get access to capital. Lenders, such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), put conditions which require
benefit-sharing. [However, benefit-sharing may not be well connected to
real community needs and faces implementation challenges, if these
standards do not conform to the local realities]{.underline} \[20\]. [In
Alaska, voluntary local/indigenous employment quotas and hiring
preferences negotiations take place, yet **the company makes the final
decision** on them. The common practice in Alaska is contractual
agreements and royalty payments for using private land, which native
corporations and oil companies negotiate.]{.underline}

[The semi-formal mechanism of benefit-sharing occurs when a company
responds to community actors', local authorities', or private citizens'
requests often without much transparency or public
participation.]{.underline} Companies are selective in their replies to
certain local petitions, which helps them in risks avoidance. [The
decision-making power always rests with corporate leadership, and is
often perceived as the company's goodwill, to which a local community is
not formally entitled.]{.underline} From a company's standpoint, this is
a "social expenditure" embedded in its role as a dominant local economic
actor.

The trickle-down benefit mechanism includes gains the community
experiences from general economic impacts, such as income growth,
employment, increased consumer spending, new infrastructure development,
procurement through indigenous, and local businesses and the creation of
local jobs. Trickle-down benefits are typically unspecified in
benefit-sharing agreements, are not based on companies' strategy, and
emerge due to the multiplier effect in the economy or increases in cash
flow in local consumption \[18\].

In cases where companies strategically develop an effective stakeholder
approach, benefit-sharing arrangements are expected to contribute to
local communities' welfare and enhance the residents' control over their
lives \[44,45\]. [Principles of "fair and equitable benefit-sharing" are
rooted in international conventions related to biodiversity protection,
international human rights, maritime law and the right to
science]{.underline} \[46,47\].

To analyze perceived fairness and equitability of benefit-sharing
arrangements in Alaska, we employ the equity concept differentiating
between participatory and distributive equity \[48\]. The former is
associated with indigenous communities' participation in
decision-making, particularly regarding the forms and the number of
benefits received. The latter implies that the funds and benefits
received by the communities from the oil companies are distributed in an
equitable way.

The regimes, modes, principles, and mechanisms that we described above
have an impact on perceived equity in benefit-sharing arrangements as
they highlight in what cases negotiations may exercise participatory
equity, and to what extent the design of the existing legislation, such
as Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act (ANCSA), can foster distributive
equity.

Many [**[transnational energy companies are engaged in]{.mark}** the
[exploration and development of oil reserves in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and are [[facing]{.mark} policy
c[hallenges]{.mark} in respect [to **benefit sharing with the local
communities.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Benefit sharing arrangements between
oil and natural gas companies and indigenous communities were
investigated in Nenets and Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Districts, Irkutsk
and Sakhalin regions in Russia and the North Slope of Alaska[. We argue
that **[Indigenous communities are not equally benefitting from oil and
gas extraction]{.mark},** and no one benefit sharing policy model seems
to ensure a sustainable local developmen]{.underline}t. This may stem
from the mismatch between benefit sharing policies and local
institutional frameworks. Thus, as a part of benefit sharing
obligations[, **[companies and the state must work with Indigenous
peoples and other affected communities to build local capacities and
human capital]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There is an urgent need to improve
our knowledge base about benefit sharing in the Arctic energy sector,
and we urge the Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group
and/or the Arctic Economic Council to conduct a synthesis study aiming
at finding best practices, identifying lessons learned, and initiating
an inclusive, multi-stakeholder process of developing guidelines for
companies on benefit-sharing in the Arctic.

Since the last century, [the Arctic has become an important arena for
energy resource extraction]{.underline}, and [this activity is expected
to grow in the decades to come]{.underline} \[\[1\], \[2\]\]. Many
transnational energy [companies (TNC) are actively engaged in the
exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves in the high
latitudes,]{.underline} and are facing serious policy challenges in
respect to dealing with the local communities and state actors[. **[Oil
and natural gas extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} in remote regions,
including the Arctic, brings opportunities for development, but [also
**[inflicts costs to local communities and Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It affects the subsistence economy and
removes land from traditional resource use. [The costs of resource
extraction to local communities may outweigh the benefits, which, in
turn, affect the social and environmental security in the
Arctic]{.underline} \[3\].

The majority of [oil and gas companies in the Arctic]{.underline} have
[declared]{.underline} their [commitment to benefit-sharing arrangements
that assist local and Indigenous communities and protect local and
Indigenous rights]{.underline} to land and traditional resources \[4\].
Benefit sharing generally refers to an exchange between actors granting
access to a particular resource and actors providing compensation or
reward for its use \[5\], as well as the distribution of the monetary
and non-monetary benefits produced by a resource-based project \[6\].

The implementation of these commitments varies considerably among the
regions, companies, and communities. Large surveys of literature have
been undertaken in respect to benefit sharing in mining industry (see
\[\[7\], \[8\], \[9\]\]), including remote regions \[\[10\], \[11\],
\[12\], \[13\]\], but only recently the discussion has evolved to focus
on the energy extractive sector in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
\[\[14\], \[15\], \[16\], \[17\], \[18\]\]. [The analysis and
systematization of Arctic experiences is still in its beginning
stages,]{.underline} although there is enough empirical material and
case studies to present a classification and initial assessment of the
benefit sharing modes and policy models, as we attempt below.

Wildlife habitat and climate change

These public lands encompass about 6,700 miles of rivers and streams
accessible to fish migrating from the ocean---including five varieties
of Pacific salmon, among other species supported by these waters.11
Nearly 15 million acres of the lands under review also fall within the
range of the Western Arctic caribou herd,12 one of the largest caribou
herds on the planet.13 Abundant moose populations and a vast number of
migratory birds and other species also utilize these diverse habitats.14

Particularly as Alaska is warming two to three times faster than the
global average,15 [these intact and well-connected BLM public lands
represent a vital buffer against the impacts of climate change. Several
Alaskan wildlife populations have seen major declines in recent years,
and remaining populations rely heavily on intact, protected
lands.]{.underline}16 [Resilient populations of chinook and sockeye
salmon in the Bristol Bay watershed depend on the interconnected
"habitat mosaics" that characterize their spawning and rearing grounds,
utilizing different parts of the watershed at different times and
allowing them to adapt to shifting conditions.]{.underline}17 Likewise,
[three of North America's largest caribou herds depend on the BLM lands
under review, which support intact migration corridors necessary to
support robust populations.]{.underline}18 Revoking protections for
these lands and waters and allowing industrial development would
fragment habitat needed to protect vulnerable fish and wildlife
populations from the effects of climate change.

In addition to their climate resilience values, [these lands also hold
important reservoirs of natural carbon important for managing the
climate crisis.]{.underline} [The public lands under review have been
estimated to store]{.underline} 164 million tons of "irrecoverable
carbon," which is carbon that would not recover by midcentury if
released now by human activity.19 That equates to more than [600 million
tons of carbon dioxide]{.underline}, or the emissions from burning
roughly 8 million tanker trucks' worth of gasoline.20

Alaska Native subsistence resources

[Approximately 80 percent of Alaska Native villages (183 total) and more
than half a million people live within 50 miles of the BLM lands under
evaluation.]{.underline}21 [Of the lands under review, 74 percent are
designated by the federal government as areas where rural community
residents have priority to hunt and fish for subsistence.]{.underline}22

[Subsistence harvesting is a foundational element of Alaska Native
traditions, as well as an important source of food, economic stability,
and other needs.]{.underline}23 [The overwhelming majority of rural
Alaskans rely on food harvested from the surrounding lands and waters,
with 86 percent of rural households consuming wild game and 95 percent
consuming wild fish.24 More than a method of obtaining nutrition,
subsistence is a pillar of Alaska Native culture and a process of
communal sharing and generational bonding.]{.underline}25

Under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, federal
agencies are required to consider and minimize adverse impacts to
subsistence uses in public land use decisions.26 In passing the law in
1980, Congress found that ["the continuation of the opportunity for
subsistence uses ... is essential to Native physical, economic,
traditional, and cultural existence."]{.underline}27

Revoking D-1 protections would open those [public lands to industrial
minerals development]{.underline}, resulting in likely [impacts to fish
and wildlife populations and displacement of subsistence
activities.]{.underline}28 Additionally, lifting D-1 protections and
subsequent conveyance of some of those lands to the state of Alaska
would result in Alaska Native communities and other rural residents
losing priority for subsistence use of fish and wildlife resources
offered by the federal government on federal lands.29 This subsistence
priority enables subsistence activities locally, with beneficial harvest
limits and hunting seasons and according to traditional customs.30

[Tensions flared between Alaska Native groups, environmentalists and the
federal Bureau of Land Management during a congressional
hearing]{.underline} Wednesday [about legislation to reverse Biden-era
protections against oil drilling and energy production on Alaska's North
Slope.]{.underline}

[The legislative hearing centered on]{.underline} H.R. 6285, or
[Alaska's Right to Produce Act]{.underline}. [The bill]{.underline},
introduced in the House in early November by Representatives Pete
Stauber (R-Minn.) and Mary Sattler Peltola (D-Alaska.), [seeks to
reinstate leases on oil tracts canceled by President Joe Biden's
administration]{.underline}, and overturn protections announced in
September of this year.

[While two local tribal groups advocated for the
legislation]{.underline}, insisting it would pave the way for
much-needed economic development in their marginalized communities,
[others expressed concerns about its potential environmental
impact]{.underline}. Karlin Itchoak, [a member of the]{.underline}

[Nome Eskimo Community and the Alaska Regional Senior Directory for The
Wilderness Society, warned the legislation could unleash environmental
hazards in the region that would harm both tribal communities and
surrounding ecosystems.]{.underline}

"[Oil and gas drilling would have devastating impacts on this sensitive
ecosystem, caused by the massive infrastructure needed to extract and
transport these fossil fuels]{.underline}," Itchoak told the committee.
"[Drilling the Arctic is risky, would fragment vital habitat, and
chronic spills of oil and other toxic substances onto the fragile tundra
would forever scar this landscape and disrupt its
wildlife]{.underline}."

[Doreen Leavitt]{.underline}, [director of Natural Resources and Tribal
Council Secretary for the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope (ICAS,)
argued that the]{.underline} Biden [administration's actions amounted to
a slight against Alaska Native villages' right to
self-determination.]{.underline} [By instituting federal environmental
protections in September without a government-to-government
conversation]{.underline}, Leavitt said, [the administration foisted
protections the tribe didn't want.]{.underline}

"[The unilateral actions that took place]{.underline} on September 6 ---
[without prior consultation with the only Indigenous group who calls the
affected lands home --- is not just a dereliction of duty, an issue of
mere miscommunication, or disrespect for Indigenous voices. It is a
violation of the rule of law,]{.underline}" Leavitt said. "\...our
self-determination is something to be fought for still to this day. This
includes continuously reminding Washington about our legal rights,
including calling out the administration for shirking its
government-to-government consultative responsibilities to the North
Slope Iñupiat."

#### Current mining management not ideal to indigenous people

**Greenfield 21** (Nicole Greenfield, writer based in New York,
04/20/2021, "Alaska Natives Lead a Unified Resistance to the Pebble
Mine", NRDC,
https://www.nrdc.org/stories/alaska-natives-lead-unified-resistance-pebble-mine)//ishi

The Bristol Bay region, in southwestern Alaska, is a mix of wild tundra
and wetlands, with 40,000 square miles of pristine rivers and lakes and
thousands of intact headwaters streams that sustain the world's greatest
wild salmon fishery. [For close to two decades, the prospect of a
massive open-pit gold and copper mine in the area---about 200 miles from
Anchorage and reachable only by air or water---has loomed large for the
thousands who live and work there, threatening to decimate the fishery
and the cultural traditions, economy, and ecosystems inextricably linked
to it.]{.underline}

[More than 80 percent of people in the region believe the mine poses a
threat to its fisheries.]{.underline} Pete Andrew Jr., a commercial and
subsistence fisherman based there, puts it bluntly: "If you could pick
the ultimate worst place in the world to create a mine, this is the very
spot."

So when [the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit for the Pebble
Mine this past November]{.underline}, it was cause for celebration, if a
cautious one. It was the latest setback for the project---valued at
\$400 billion to \$600 billion---since Northern Dynasty Minerals, a
cash-starved, Canadian junior mining company, first acquired the rights
to the Pebble deposit in 2001. Through the decades, with investors
coming and going and presidential administrations changing, and even as
the permit process now enters an appeal stage, [Bristol Bay residents
have remained determined to keep Pebble out.]{.underline}

"This is probably [one of the most diverse coalitions]{.underline}
you\'ll ever find [in an environmental battle]{.underline}," says NRDC's
Joel Reynolds, referring to [the tribal members, commercial and
recreational fishers, hunters, businesses, faith leaders, and nonprofit
organizations]{.underline} that [have united to stop
Pebble.]{.underline}

The strategies they've used have been diverse as well. They've held
community engagement events, advertised in national newspapers, and
enlisted the support of major jewelry companies like Tiffany & Co.,
while also testifying at shareholder meetings of the project's investors
and meeting with the mining companies' CEOs. Collectively, their efforts
have led to the departure of Mitsubishi Corporation (2011), Anglo
American (2013), Rio Tinto (2014), and First Quantum Minerals (2018)
from the project's rotating list of backers.

Simultaneously[, they have worked together with NRDC to pressure the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use its authority under
the Clean Water Act to protect Bristol Bay.]{.underline} (Through
Section 404(c) of the act, the EPA may prohibit, restrict, or deny
permits if a project would have "unacceptable adverse effects" on the
environment.)

Now, as advocates take note of Northern Dynasty's increasingly desperate
maneuvers to entice new investors---and welcome a new administration
that is committed to conservation---[they are fighting for permanent
federal protections]{.underline}. [The Call to Protect Bristol Bay has
been jointly released by the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, Bristol Bay
Native Association (BBNA), and the Bristol Bay Economic Development
Corporation.]{.underline} [NRDC and the Commercial Fishermen for Bristol
Bay have written letters to EPA Administrator Michael Regan in support
of this tribal-led call.]{.underline}

Taryn Kiekow Heimer, who, with Reynolds, leads the Pebble Mine work at
NRDC, explains that [the campaign is so much bigger than just fighting
to stop a mine]{.underline}. "It's been the honor of my lifetime to
stand in solidarity with the Indigenous People and tribes and commercial
fishermen of Bristol Bay," she says. Below, just five of the Alaska
Natives who have been doing that work.

#### Indigenous consult is required for indigenous rights

//ishi

"[The mining industry has a long history of failing to respect community
interests, including not consulting locals, breaking agreements,
destroying sacred sites, and forcing displacements]{.underline}," Aspen
said.

The result is that [Indigenous communities have been "disproportionately
impacted" and that includes a failure to share in the economic reward
from mining.]{.underline}

The key point: "[Without a social license to operate, mines will
struggle to receive permits, raise capital, and bring minerals to
market, and the United States will not realize its full potential for
domestic production]{.underline}." And in this case a failure of
domestic production has significant consequences for a warming world.

The Aspen Institute's task force makes two major recommendations: That
[mining projects embrace Free, Prior and Informed Consent (or FPIC) and
that Congress should make sure that tribes have the financial resources
and technical expertise to evaluate projects.]{.underline}

The very idea of Free, Prior and Informed Consent is too often unclear,
Aspen found, while there is often rhetorical support from mining
companies for consultation, there is less support for real consent and
"whether it should constitute a veto."

The task force said [one attractive alternative is to make FPIC a
binding concept for tribal nations that are geographically adjacent to
mining projects. A second, less stringent standard, could be used for
tribes further away that still have significant environmental and
cultural ties to an area]{.underline}. "In both cases, the process of
consultation would be required, augmented by clearer standards and
guidelines from Congress on the timelines and scope for the consultation
process."

Then as the Aspen report points out [even without a clear standard for
FPIC when tribal nations are opposed to a project they can effectively
prevent project approval for decades.]{.underline} "A clearer
understanding of what it means to withhold consent, as well as who
possesses the ability to do so, will expedite the process," the Aspen
report said.

Indeed, on the very day the report was being released in Washington, a
coalition of tribes in Nevada continued their opposition to a lithium
mine at Thacker Pass.

"[Lithium mines and this whole push for renewable energy --- the agenda
of the Green New Deal --- is what I like to call green
colonialism,]{.underline}″ said Darinda Hinkey. She is a citizen of the
Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe and a leader of a group known
as People of Red Mountain. "[It's going to directly affect]{.underline}
my [people,]{.underline} my [culture,]{.underline} my
[religion,]{.underline} my [tradition."]{.underline}

(Chart from Aspen Institute report: A Critical Minerals Policy for the
United States)

(Chart from Aspen Institute report: A Critical Minerals Policy for the
United States)

The Biden administration dismissed Indigenous concerns about the project
and there was no attempt at Free, Prior and Informed Consent.

The Aspen report said [Congress needs to clarify and enforce the rights
of Indigenous people when it comes to mining.]{.underline}

"The Task Force recommends [clarifying that Free, Prior, and Informed
Consent---in the sense of consent being a requirement for
progress---applies to Tribal Nations directly impacted by critical
mineral development; best efforts to achieve consent should also be
sought from Tribal Nations which can only claim to be affected
indirectly by such development. In both cases, consultations are
essential.]{.underline}"

"The Task Force's recommendations---around [permitting reform, Free
Prior and Informed Consent, and Tribal Nation project equity---will help
boost U.S. critical mineral supply in a manner that is economically,
environmentally, and socially responsible and innovative]{.underline}.
Even still, the United States will be unable to bring new projects
online as quickly as is needed to meet future needs or completely
eliminate dependence on China for refining and processing supply
chains," the report said.

A second recommendation from the Aspen task force is a call for Congress
to fund technical and financial resources for tribes as they evaluate
and consider mining projects, including ownership. Aspen cites the work
of the First Nations Major Projects Coalition, 27 nations that have
joined together to access capital and technical expertise.

The goal would be for tribal nations to be full partners, even owners,
giving them a seat at the table for making decisions about what is
developed. "[Congress can help ensure that Tribal Nations are more
meaningfully invested in these projects by providing concessional
financing and loan guarantees to Tribal Nations that are interested in
obtaining equity in critical mineral projects]{.underline}," the task
force wrote.

#### Paternalistic and CSR Regimes are distinct and harmful compared to Co-Management Regimes.

**Tysiachniouk 20**, \*Chair of the Environmental Sociology group at the
Center for Independent Social Research, St. Petersburg. (Maria S.
Tysiachniouk ,7-5-2020, \"Disentangling Benefit-Sharing Complexities of
Oil Extraction on the North Slope of Alaska\", MDPI,
https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/13/5432) //ishi

Native corporations are engaged in both stakeholder and shareholder
relationship with Indigenous Peoples. The [stakeholder relationship
involves **CSR**]{.underline}, while shareholder relationship uses
mandated mechanism of delivery of shares determined by ANCSA. In this
way, native corporations' practice dual investment, yet to the same
target group, to Indigenous Peoples \[**33**\]. [Despite investment
inequalities that are apparent]{.underline} and originate [from the
ANCSA]{.underline} design as only those born before 1971 receive shares
according to the law requires. [Native corporations were responsible for
decisions]{.underline} [related]{.underline} [to]{.underline} shares for
"[afterborns]{.underline}". This influenced distributive equity. High
distributive equity can characterize the ASRC shares with "afterborns",
while distributive equity of village corporations remains to be low,
creating intergenerational inequalities. Shareholders of village
corporations themselves became responsible for inequities toward
"afterborns." Due to this fact, in villages of the North Slope, a
significant population of natives has grown, who are not shareholders.
[This creates sharp inequalities]{.underline}. Nuiqsut natives became
shareholders of wealthy Kuukpik corporation as Kuukpik is involved in
the oil business, yet other villages have less successful native
corporations. This created another set of inequalities between villages
on the North Slope. Native corporations operate like other corporations
in the US, and do not allow much participation by shareholders.
Therefore, [participatory equity is also low.]{.underline}

Transnational [oil companies implementing]{.underline} their
[stakeholder strategy]{.underline} engage with communities [using a
**mixed-mode** of benefit-sharing. **CCSR is dominant**]{.underline};
however, oil companies' partner with native corporations and create
partnerships in co-management of subsistence natural resources.
Contracting services with oil companies belonging to native corporations
contribute to the shareholder mode as they share revenue from their
contractors. [With communities at large, relationships are mostly
paternalistic]{.underline}. [Participatory equity is high in
relationships between oil companies and native corporations and
relatively low with communities at large.]{.underline} The distributive
equity seems to be high because although communities receive a
significant amount of funds, they are not satisfied and would like more
financial support.

Our research shows that [powerful actors predominantly]{.underline}
[make decisions on]{.underline} the [distribution]{.underline} of
benefits. The NSB decides on large construction projects on the North
Slope with ASRC under closed doors. Transnational oil companies and
native corporations negotiate Land use agreements and contracts.
Representatives of native corporations are negotiating on behalf of all
Inupiat people, securing subsistence hunting and preservation of
cultures.

Native [**corporations** have a **strong voice**]{.underline} in
negotiations, while native [villages]{.underline} (tribes) [have
political power]{.underline}. Tribes have a government to government
consultations with BLM regarding oil development. However, despite
political power that was granted to them, they remain to be fragile
actors in negotiations. Tribes and cities are always invited to multiple
consultations and meetings, such as workshops on the Arctic Slope
mitigation strategy, subsistence advisory panels, community meetings
with companies. At these forums, tribe and city representatives express
their grievances, express their needs, and ask for monetary and
non-monetary support. However[, major decisions and negotiations are
happening]{.underline} [between]{.underline} more [resourceful business
actors]{.underline}, while more [fragile actors are in the position of
the needed.]{.underline} This has an impact on the SLO.

The NSB and [native corporations easily give]{.underline} the [SLO to
transnational oil companies]{.underline}, while **[tribes mostly resist
development]{.underline}**. This happens because, in Alaska, there are
multi-layer governing institutions that have different attitudes toward
oil extraction that hardly reach consensus in decisions on
benefit-sharing arrangements. Native corporations became part and parcel
of Alaska corporate world, welcoming further development both on-shore
and offshore and acknowledging that oil extraction can go hand in hand
with traditional subsistence hunting and maintenance of Inupiat
cultures.

Tribal governments are facing contradictions of the market economy
introduced by oil development with the values of Indigenous Peoples,
their subsistence lifestyle, food sharing traditions, and communal
economy. Their stakes and attitudes toward oil expansion and benefits
coming from oil differ from those of native corporations. City
governments maintain a more neutral position.

This influences the dynamics around the SLO, which is mythical in Alaska
as communities cannot stop development on licenses that are purchased by
companies. The SLO assumes approval of development by wider society, but
societies in Alaska are divided. SLO has strong normative dimensions,
and therefore, differences in attitudes toward development of native
corporations and tribes are apparent.

Native [corporations, both regional and village easily approve the SLO
to any new projects]{.underline} as they are involved in partnerships
and contractual relationships with transnational oil companies. Alaska
Natives are shareholders of native corporations, so they approve the
business of native corporations, giving them the SLO. However, [tribes
do not welcome new oil development on licenses]{.underline} bought by
the transnational companies despite the significant money flow, coming
from oil and multiple benefits that they receive.

We previously discussed our research findings of benefit-sharing and its
multiple advantages and disadvantages and its capacity for advancement,
but we have not found a perfect standard of a benefit-sharing regime in
Alaska. The North Slope of Alaska has evaded the resource curse
\[**8**\]. However, the [area did not accomplish sustainable development
in general]{.underline}. The [North Slope Borough did not achieve
economic, social, and environmental arrangements
altogether.]{.underline} Sustainable development on the North Slope
includes ensuring the wellbeing and subsistence of the local indigenous
populations and the ecosystems in the area \[**106**\]. The goal of
benefit-sharing is to protect the environment and human health and
prosperity as much as possible and provide financial compensation for
the degradation of the land or ecological systems in the area.
[Benefit-sharing, which supports the sustainability of a
community]{.underline}, [is an instrument that assures economic,
environmental, and social sustainability]{.underline}, **[if designed
properly]{.underline}** \[**106**\].

In future research, academics may benefit from indigenous knowledge to
identify how to convert current benefit-sharing into benefit
co-management in the future \[**21**\]. The [current form of
benefit-sharing is an informal system]{.underline} in [which a company
acknowledges the Indigenous populations']{.underline} [right to
compensation and assistance]{.underline}. It can also be formal
compliance with legislation and permitting requirements. This is in
contrast to benefit co-management, in which communities receive benefits
that fit their exact needs for the wellbeing and health of the community
members and ecosystems. In addition, in benefit co-management,
communities themselves take a role in devising the use of the benefits
the companies give, which the name of the system itself suggests
\[**107**\]. [In future research, there will be a need to investigate a
process to establish an effective benefit co-management
scheme]{.underline} [to ensure the sustainable co-existence of oil
companies and Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} \[**21**\].

### UQ\-\--Oil Spills Now\-\--2AC

#### Oil Spills have been widespread in the Alaskan Arctic for [decades]{.underline}.

**Davila 13**, \*Master of Science (M.S.) in Environmental Quality
Science @ University of Alaska Fairbanks. (Davila, Amanda, 12-01-2013,
\"A review of oil spill history and management on the North Slope of
Alaska\", Scholar Works \@UA,
https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/handle/11122/9763?show=full) //ishi

The initial data set utilized for this study was an export from the ADEC
SPILLS database13. This initial data set included all [spills between
July 1995 and December 2010]{.underline}, all spill substance types and
all sources. Additionally [ADEC provided another data set]{.underline},
with data for spills occurring [between 1971 and 1995.]{.underline} This
[data set included over 10,000 spill cases]{.underline} of all substance
types and sources that occurred prior to the establishment of the SPILLS
database

The ADEC SPILLS database was originally launched July 1, 1995 with the
goal of electronically managing information about oil and hazardous
substance releases on a statewide basis31. Oil and hazardous substance
spill reports / notifications are received by the ADEC Area Response
Teams from the responsible party or complainant by telephone or
facsimile. The report is then entered into the database by ADEC staff.
Spill records are loaded into a web application for browsing and editing
by the individual spill upon user request.

In order to effectively manage the effort of compiling, validating and
manipulating the spill data, the information was first sorted by year.
The most time consuming effort was in the data validation process. The
spill data was sorted by individual record. Sorting by unique spill
number was not possible due to multiple duplications of spill numbers
for an individual spill or a single spill with multiple products (i.e.
produced water, having both crude oil and seawater typically) with
multiple spill numbers. This was verified by examining the spill date
and time, location, source, product and spill volume for the
duplications.

[Spill substances were then grouped for simplicity]{.underline}. [Three
groups were created: crude oil, petroleum products and hydrocarbons. The
crude oil category is just for crude oil spills only]{.underline}. The
petroleum product category assumed anything processed. [**Gasoline**,
**diesel**, grease, engine lube, and transmission **oil spills** are
examples of what is grouped in the petroleum product
category]{.underline}. The hydrocarbon spills encompass all spills from
the crude oil category and the petroleum products category

[Figure 3 summarizes the spill data for crude oil, petroleum products,
and all spill substances]{.underline}. [Over the 25 year period, there
was an average of 76 crude oil spills, 253 petroleum product spills, and
538 hydrocarbon spills associated with North Slope
operations.]{.underline} Although statistics on the number of spills are
presented, the environmental consequences of oil spills are likely to
depend more on the volume than the number of oil spills.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

Produced water is water that is associated with oil and gas formations.
This water may beextracted from the reservoir or injected into it.
Produced water may also be known as "brine" that commonly contains high
mineral or salt concentrations.

The data, however, may include the crude component of the produced
water. If the crude oil component was calculated and reported, it was
included in this research. It is not possible to determine if it was
only the crude fraction reported or a separate crude oil spill without
going back to the original records, many of which don't exist.

Listed below is a brief synopsis of the significant releases of
oil-related spills in the NS subarea. This information was collected
from the ADEC spill database.13

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

As can be seen from Figure 3, [the number of reported spills was
**higher** in the early 1990's]{.underline}. This trend corresponds to
the height of the crude oil production of the North Slope. Additionally,
as previously discussed, the SPAR division had just been formed,
possibly resulting in an increase in oversight of the North Slope oil
activities. The petroleum products and crude oil spills also follow this
trend. The graph also demonstrates that approximately half of all spills
can be attributed to petroleum product releases. Therefore, half of all
reported spills are associated with the oil production and not the
direct process of crude extraction. [The number of crude oil spills
makes up only a fraction of the total reported spills on the North
Slope.]{.underline}

[There are three primary peaks]{.underline}, for all spills depicted in
Figure 4. The spill volume peak in 1986 was attributed to a \>1 million
gallon drilling mud release. [Drilling mud was exempted from this
study.]{.underline} There are several types of drilling fluids used
depending on the drilling conditions encountered. They may either be
water-based or oil-based fluids; water-based may either use fresh water
or salt water. Synthetic based materials are also frequently used as a
high performance drilling fluid. [Drilling muds typically have several
additives such as **corrosion inhibitors** and surfactants. Drilling mud
spills are usually accompanied by varying amounts of crude oil and
saline water.]{.underline}20

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

The second peak in 1997 was a spill of just under 1 million gallons of
seawater. Seawater is typically injected into the petroleum reservoir to
maintain formation pressures and allow secondary oil recovery from
production wells. Seawater spills are also reportable events to ADEC.
The high levels of sodium and chlorine ions in saline spills increase
the osmotic potential of soil water, making water uptake more difficult
or impossible for non-salt tolerant tundra plants.20

The third peak in 2006 is primarily attributed to three spill events.
[The first contributing spill event was an almost quarter of million
gallons of produced water.]{.underline} The second contributing spill
was just shy of a third of a million gallons of drilling muds. Lastly,
was the Gathering Center #2 (GC-2) Oil Transit Line Release. On March 2,
2006 a transit line between GC-2 and GC-1 developed a quarter inch hole
in the pipeline due to internal corrosion.13 Approximately 201,000 +/-
gallons of crude oil spilled and covered almost 2 acres consisting of
tundra and a frozen lake.13

The number of spills on the NS and the crude production can be seen in
Figure 5. The trend is consistent with activity. The time during the
peak oil is when we see the higher number of spills. Over time, as the
oil production and activity decline, so do the number of spills with a
few exceptions. The decline in oil production has limited activity and
growth on the NS. However, [we]{.underline} may [see more spills as the
infrastructure ages.]{.underline}

**[promote U.S. energy production]{.mark}**, timber development and
other regulatory actions needed [to ensure]{.mark} the [responsible
management **of our natural resources** and public
lands]{.mark}.]{.underline} The sweeping legislation is a [major win and
[**critical component** of]{.mark} the Trump administration's **[Energy
Dominance]{.mark}** agenda.]{.underline} Within the Department of the
Interior, **[[the B]{.mark}ureau of [L]{.mark}and
[M]{.mark}anagement]{.underline}**, the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the
Bureau of Reclamation, the Office of Surface Mining and other relevant
offices are [working diligently to [enforce this landmark]{.mark}
congressional action]{.underline}. "[The One Big Beautiful Bill
Act]{.underline} is a historic piece of legislation that will [[restore
energy independence]{.mark} and make life more affordable for American
families [by reversing]{.mark} disastrous Biden-era [policies that
constricted domestic energy production]{.mark}]{.underline}," said
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. "This marks a significant shift in how
we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with
local communities. The [Department is proud to implement President
Trump's agenda and get the federal government back to working for the
American people]{.underline}." The following are [[significant changes
enacted]{.mark} by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act]{.underline}, which
Interior will be implementing through an expedited rulemaking process:
**[[Offshore oil and gas development]{.mark}]{.underline}** The federal
[[royalty rate]{.underline}]{.mark} is reduced to [[no less than
12.5%]{.mark} and no greater than 16.67%.]{.underline} This change
[gives the Department of the Interior increased discretion to [encourage
domestic]{.mark} Outer Continental Shelf [production and
investment]{.mark} by lowering the royalty rate charged to
producers.]{.underline} In 2022, [the Inflation Reduction
Act]{.underline} mandated a 16.67% minimum royalty rate, [discouraging
investment in domestic oil and gas production]{.underline}. In the Gulf
of America, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is mandated to hold at
least two offshore lease sales each year through 2039. The first of
these lease sales is scheduled on December 10, 2025. The second of these
lease sales will be held by March 15, 2026, and the third will be held
by August 15, 2026. [**[Alaska leasing resumes]{.mark}** with a
**[minimum of six offshore lease sales]{.mark}** occurring in the Cook
Inlet Planning Area Leasing from 2026-2032.]{.underline} The first of
these lease sales will be held by March 15, 2026. Under the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or
BSEE, must approve commingling requests unless safety or resource
recovery would be harmed. Downhole commingling is the production of oil
or natural gas from multiple reservoirs through a single well. The
process allows for more efficient and cost-effective production. Onshore
oil and gas development The royalty rate for new federal onshore
production will also return to a minimum 12.5%, reversing the 16.67%
rate established in the Inflation Reduction Act. This royalty rate
reduction will [lead to an estimated 225 additional leases in
2026]{.underline}, and over the following few years, will lead to an
average of 160 wells drilled on these additional leases. [Onshore lease
sales]{.underline} will be [required quarterly in]{.underline} Wyoming,
New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada and
[Alaska]{.underline}. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates
expression of interest fees, paid by lessees to nominate land for
leasing, also an unnecessary measure pushed by Democrats in the
Inflation Reduction Act to restrict new energy production Upon approval,
a permit to drill will now be valid for a four-year period. The royalty
requirement is repealed on extracted methane established by the
Inflation Reduction Act, which recklessly forced producers to pay
extremely burdensome fees or to shut-in production. The Bureau of Land
Management, or BLM, must now lease nominated parcels within 18 months
and may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval
included in the resource management plans. New legal definitions for
"eligible" and "available" lands are being adopted to reduce leasing
disputes. [The [BLM]{.mark} will [update]{.mark} oil and gas
[regulations that]{.mark} would make it [easier]{.mark} for operators to
combine, or commingle, production [from multiple leases]{.mark}. This
measure reduces costs, improves production and decreases surface
use.]{.underline} Coal The royalty rate will be reduced from 12.5% to
7%, which significantly decreases the per-ton cost of producing coal,
improving financial viability for producers. Federal leasing will be
restored, including a mandate to increase the availability for lease of
4 million acres of public lands with known coal reserves. Coal lease
reviews will be streamlined. Water Infrastructure and Hydropower 3/3 The
Bureau of Reclamation will adopt an accelerated permitting process for
major water infrastructure projects, including dams, canals and
reservoirs, by allowing Reclamation to use the voluntary National
Environmental Policy Act fee system. Access to hydropower development
will be expanded on federal dams, with streamlined licensing and
priority for water storage projects that include power generation.
Reclamation will be able to expedite review of Title XVI water recycling
projects and desalination feasibility studies, removing certain previous
cost caps. Reclamation is directed to issue guidance on leveraging
public-private partnerships for infrastructure upgrades, including
drought resilience and water reuse systems. The One Big Beautiful Bill
Act allocates \$1 billion to the Bureau of Reclamation through 2034 for
construction and associated activities that restore or increase the
capacity or use of existing conveyance facilities or for construction
that increases the capacity of existing surface water storage
facilities. Forestry and Public Lands The BLM will expand timber sales,
increasing by 20 million board feet annually. Furthermore, the BLM will
prioritize long-term timber contracts and open additional harvests. In
addition to the actions above, the Department will address provisions in
the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to eliminate longstanding right-of-way
and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar
projects, bringing an end to years of subsidies for economically
unviable energy development. From boosting American energy production
and revitalizing the clean coal sector, to accelerating domestic mineral
development, expanding timber harvesting and cutting burdensome
regulations, the Department of the Interior---under Secretary Burgum's
leadership---is delivering results and advancing President Trump's bold
agenda through the One Big Beautiful Bill. [[The BLM manages]{.mark}
about [245 million acres]{.mark} of public land located primarily in 12
western states, [including Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}, on behalf of the
American people. The BLM also administers 700 million acres of
sub-surface mineral estate throughout the nation. Our mission is to
sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of America's public
lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.

Since the last century, the Arctic has become an important arena for
energy resource extraction, and this activity is expected to grow in the
decades to come \[\[1\], \[2\]\]. [Many transnational energy companies
([TNC]{.mark}) are actively [engaged in]{.mark} the exploration and
development of [oil and natural gas reserves]{.mark} in the high
latitudes, and are facing serious policy challenges in respect to
dealing with the local communities and state actors]{.underline}. Oil
and natural gas extraction in remote regions, including the Arctic,
brings opportunities for development, but also inflicts costs to local
communities and Indigenous peoples. It affects the subsistence economy
and removes land from traditional resource use. The costs of resource
extraction to local communities may outweigh the benefits, which, in
turn, affect the social and environmental security in the Arctic \[3\].
[The [majority of oil and gas companies in the Arctic]{.mark} have
[declared]{.mark} their [commitment to benefit-sharing
arrangements]{.mark} that [assist]{.mark} local and [Indigenous
communities and]{.mark} protect local and [Indigenous rights to land and
traditional resources]{.mark}]{.underline} \[4\]. Benefit sharing
generally refers to an [[exchange]{.mark} between actors granting
[access to]{.mark} a particular [resource and]{.mark} actors providing
[compensation]{.mark} or reward for its use]{.underline} \[5\], as well
as the [distribution of the [monetary and non-monetary]{.mark} benefits
produced by a resource-based project \[]{.underline}6\]. The
implementation of these commitments varies considerably among the
regions, companies, and communities. Large surveys of literature have
been undertaken in respect to benefit sharing in mining industry (see
\[\[7\], \[8\], \[9\]\]), including remote regions \[\[10\], \[11\],
\[12\], \[13\]\], but only recently the discussion has evolved to focus
on the energy extractive sector in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions
\[\[14\], \[15\], \[16\], \[17\], \[18\]\]. The analysis and
systematization of Arctic experiences is still in its beginning stages,
although there is enough empirical material and case studies to present
a classification and initial assessment of the benefit sharing modes and
policy models, as we attempt below. The review of benefit sharing
arrangements in different Arctic countries and regions is based on our
field case studies in Russia and Alaska, as well as, on literature
review. Field work took place 2014--2017 in Nenets Autonomous District,
Khanti-Mansi Autonomous District, Sakhalin Island, Irkutsk Region, and
the North Slope of Alaska. Qualitative methodology using semi-structured
interviews, participant observations, and document analysis has been
used. In addition, literature on the topic of benefit sharing has been
analysed. Research indicates that there is seemingly no ideal blueprint,
or a single set of best practices leading to benefit sharing conditions
satisfactory to local and Indigenous-nomadic communities. By examining
the typology of benefit sharing governance modes and corresponding
company policy models, we argue that some modes are more advantageous
for meeting community needs and fostering sustainable development in
remote regions. Concurrently, we explain why, despite
company-community-state cooperation dating back to at least the 1970s,
we have not seen the emergence of a successful benefit sharing model. We
analyse what elements of Alaskan and Russian experiences could be used
to build more locally-responsive and sustainable Arctic benefit sharing
frameworks. Finally, we present our policy perspective and suggest new
research directions to fill existing knowledge and policy gaps.

A. An Inuit Framework for Food Security and Food Sovereignty

In 2020, the ICC Alaska published Food Sovereignty and Self-Governance:
Inuit Role in Managing Arctic Marine Resources. The 144-page report
documents resource management in Inuit communities in Alaska and the
Inuvialuit Settlement Region of Canada. [It analyzes the legislative and
regulatory structures that govern Inuit food security and evaluates
existing co-management schemes. Moreover, the report offers a framework
for understanding food security rooted in Indigenous Knowledge, using
theoretical tools devised by and for Inuit. The ICC Alaska framework
recognizes that [food security]{.mark} involves **[more than material
subsistence]{.mark}** because [food-based practices]{.mark} are [bound
up with]{.mark} **[spirituality, linguistics, knowledge, environmental
health, and self-governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}33 The report
ultimately asserts that food security requires ["food sovereignty,"
[defined as:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[the [right]{.mark} of all Inuit [to define]{.mark} their [own hunting,
gathering, fishing, land, and water policies;]{.mark} the [right to
define]{.mark} [what is]{.mark} [sustainably, socially, economically,
and culturally appropriate for the distribution of food and to maintain
ecological health;]{.mark} and the [right to obtain and maintain
practices that ensure]{.mark} access to tools needed to [obtain,
process, store, and consume traditional foods.]{.mark}]{.underline}34

While ICC Alaska uses the language of rights to describe the concept of
food sovereignty, structurally, [the distinction between food security
and food sovereignty involves power. [Food sovereignty ensures food
security]{.mark} insofar as it [requires Native control of Native
foods,]{.mark} which [in turn requires control over resources and
land.]{.mark}]{.underline}35

[This notion of food sovereignty stands apart from Alaska's existing
resource management strategies, including models developed by
progressive management researchers and regulators who embrace the
rhetoric of co-management and Indigenous Knowledge.]{.underline} As Part
III details, [academic and professional discussions of subsistence
rights and resource management feature a limited space for change,
restricted by technocratic and colonial assumptions. These restrictive
visions of co-management seek to fit Indigenous consultants and
Indigenous Knowledge into the existing American management
framework.]{.underline} They fail to imagine a real transfer of
decision-making power to Natives, let alone management regimes
structurally informed by Native worldviews. To achieve the ICC Alaska
notion of food sovereignty, the discourse of co-management must be
upset.

Climate Change Presents New Challenges

In addition to economic, social, and political change, accelerating
environmental changes associ-ated with climate warming add a layer of
complex-ity and vulnerability to the harvesting of wild foods (Brinkman,
Hansen, Chapin, Kofinas, BurnSilver, & Rupp, 2016). Climate assessments
have shown warming in the Arctic that is about twice the global average
(Chapin et al., 2014, Comiso & Hall, 2014). Indigenous communities
experience impacts from this warming in a number of ways. For example,
frozen rivers are important travel corridors for hunting, trapping, and
wood harvesting. Warmer winters have led to later freeze-up and earlier
break-up of rivers in addition to longer time that rivers are unsafe to
travel on, thus inhibiting access to harvest resources (Brown, Brinkman,
Verbyla, Brown, Cold, & Hollingsworth, 2018). These changes influence
not only human movement but also the migration of wildlife, such as
caribou, on which communities rely (Leblond, St-Laurent, & Côté, 2016).

[In the past, reliable environmental cues such as the timing of the
seasons and consistency in fish, bird, and wildlife migration supported
cultural sta-bility. Flexibility and innovation within the social and
governance structures of Indigenous commu-nities supported a robust
knowledge system---hereafter referred to as Traditional Ecological
Knowledge (TEK)---that strengthened capacity to adapt to significant
environmental variability]{.underline} (Barnhardt & Kawagley, 2005;
Pearce, Ford, Wilcox, & Smit, 2014). With the rate of environ-mental
change, the landscape is becoming less familiar to the people that have
always known it well, and TEK is becoming less reliable (Cochran et al.,
2013; Pearce et al., 2014). For example, co-author Huntington recalls a
well-known bear den located near his home community of Huslia. Knowledge
of the den was passed down for gener-ations. It was located on a
thermokarst ridge, which is now the location of wetlands and dry lakes
and the den no longer exists. Within one genera-tion this past knowledge
became obsolete (Huntington & Watson, 2012). While the
Intergov-ernmental Panel on Climate Change asserts that cli-mate change
is one of the most significant chal-lenges facing the globe in the
current century (Larsen et al., 2014), [Indigenous communities will
disproportionately experience the impacts from cli-mate change, due to
not only their strong reliance on the environment for their livelihoods
but also the legacies of colonialism that have challenged the
perpetuation of their way of life]{.underline} (Ford et al., 2018;
McNeely, 2011).

[Despite these challenges, reliance on and shar-ing of fish, wildlife,
and other harvested resources continues to be an integral source of food
security and cultural identity for Indigenous Alaska com-munities.
However, because of current challenges related to climate change,
cultural disruptions, changing economic opportunity, and a complex
management system, there is an increasing need for new creative forms of
learning and knowledge dis-tribution that can effectively support
community-based adaptations. Community-based adaptation to climate
change should be a "community-led pro-cess, based on communities\'
priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which should empower
people to plan for and cope with the impacts of cli-mate
change"]{.underline} (Reid, Mozaharul, Berger, Cannon, Huq, & Milligan,
2009, p. 13). [Relevant commu-nity-based adaptations must consider the
central role that harvest practices continue to play in sup-porting the
livelihoods, health, wellbeing, and cultural identity of Indigenous
communities.]{.underline}

While NbS holds great promise for climate resilience in the [Arctic,
barriers remain in]{.mark} its implementation and thoroughness,
particularly concerning the potential [impacts on Indigenous
communities.]{.mark} Such [impacts exacerbate]{.mark} existing
vulnerabilities, including [poverty and discrimination.]{.mark}13)
[**[Extractive industries]{.underline}** and [poorly planned development
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} can **[[threaten Indigenous lands and

initiatives. [[**Integrating Indigenous** knowledge into NbS
design]{.mark} and **implementation processes** can **[address]{.mark}
these [challenges effectively.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

To harness the full potential of NbS for climate resilience in the
Arctic**[, [it is essential to prioritize Indigenous
perspectives]{.mark} in NbS policies and practices.]{.underline}** By
prioritizing Indigenous perspectives [and leadership]{.mark},
[making]{.mark} NbS [initiatives]{.mark} can become **[[more effective,
culturally appropriate,]{.mark} and [sustainable]{.mark},
[ensuring]{.mark} the long-term [resilience of Arctic communities and
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} This requires meaningful
[engagement and [empowering Indigenous peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
decision-making processes.]{.underline} Furthermore[, [capacity-building
initiatives and knowledge-sharing platforms]{.underline}]{.mark} [can
[facilitate]{.mark} the [exchange]{.mark} [of best practices]{.mark} and
[empower Indigenous communities]{.mark} to lead NbS efforts in their
territories]{.underline}. How this can actually be facilitated is laid
out by Linda Brewer and Edith Vorderstrasse in a set of engagement
principles: [They state that [successful Arctic Social Engagement is
designed around]{.mark} a set of underlying beliefs, such as a deep
[respect for]{.mark} the [ecological experience and knowledge of]{.mark}
the local and [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}; the
acknowledgment that the involvement optimizes decision-making, the
recognition and trust for evolving relationships and the believe that
any impact must support the community and its culture.14) Empowering
Indigenous communities involves removing external pressures that hinder
autonomous evaluation, self-assessment, and responses to climate change,
including addressing inflexible and centralized policies imposed by
state governments.

[[Arctic Indigenous communities are]{.mark} already [taking]{.mark}
adaptive [action]{.mark}s [at]{.mark} the l[ocal
level]{.mark}]{.underline}, leveraging their traditional knowledge and
innovative approaches to respond to changing environmental conditions.
While these efforts may seem modest in scale, [they have far-reaching
implications for global climate resilience.]{.mark}
[[Strengthening]{.mark} the [decision-making capacity of Indigenous
communities]{.mark} is therefore [pivotal for]{.mark} ensuring a more
[resilient]{.mark}, [secure]{.mark}, and [equitable future for Arctic

#### Western solutions alone fail---only Indigenous knowledge systems offer place-based strategies capable of sustaining fragile Arctic ecosystems

https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/leveraging-indigenous-knowledge-effective-nature-based-solutions-arctic/)

[[The Arctic stands at the forefront of]{.mark} our global [climate
crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline} Experiencing [[warming at more than twice
the rate]{.mark} of [the rest of the planet]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[Arctic faces]{.mark} dramatic transformations as ancient ice melts,
permafrost thaws, and ecosystems undergo upheaval[. These
[changes]{.mark} lead to a cascade of challenges, from coastal erosion
to shifting wildlife habitats, [threatening]{.mark} both natural
[landscapes and]{.mark} the [communities]{.mark} that depend on
them.]{.underline} In response to these pressing challenges,
[[integrating Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} [into nature-based solutions
(NbS]{.mark}) [presents a]{.mark} promising [approach to]{.mark}
enhancing [climate resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NbS is a recently emerging term for actions to leverage the power of
ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure]{.underline}, and
ensure a stable and biodiverse future. These natural (climate) solutions
include conservation efforts, habitat restoration, water resource
management, and green infrastructure initiatives.1) By harnessing
natural ecosystems, [NbS can provide up to 37 percent of the mitigation
needed by 2030 to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement and give
several benefits for climate adaptation and biodiversity
enhancement.2]{.underline}) Informed and well-structured NbS can [reduce
climate change impacts on local communities and counter biodiversity
loss]{.underline}. However, effective [NbS are complex and difficult to
design,]{.underline} [especially in fragile ecosystems]{.underline}.
Therefore, [[Indigenous communities]{.mark} [and their knowledges are
crucial for finding]{.mark} effective [solutions to]{.mark} preserve and
[protect the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Combining NbS with Indigenous knowledge, also known as traditional
ecological knowledge, can greatly enhance the effectiveness of local
climate and conservation actions. Indigenous peoples, despite comprising
only a small fraction of the global population, manage between 13 and 20
percent of the world's lands, which contain approximately 80 percent of
the remaining global biodiversity. [[In the Arctic]{.mark}, this
includes communities such as [the Sámi]{.mark} in Finland, Sweden,
Norway, and Northwest Russia[; the Nenets, Khanty, Evenk, and
Chukch]{.mark}i in Russia; [the Aleut, Yupik, and Inuit (Iñupiat) in
Alaska]{.mark}; the Inuit (Inuvialuit) in Canada; and the Inuit
(Kalaallit) in Greenland.3)]{.underline} Since Indigenous communities'
[livelihoods]{.mark} are often [directly linked to the surrounding
land]{.mark}, northern Indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to
climate change, experiencing its impacts more intensely and rapidly than
many other regions. For millennia, Arctic Indigenous groups like the
Inuit and Sámi have developed sophisticated land management systems and
ecological knowledge crucial for maintaining their ecosystems' delicate
balance.This article explores the importance of combining Indigenous
knowledge with NbS to address climate change impacts in the Arctic,
highlighting the indispensable role of Indigenous expertise in achieving
successful and sustainable outcomes.

[Indigenous knowledge encompasses]{.mark} the deep, [place-based
understanding]{.mark} and practices [developed by Indigenous
communities.]{.mark} This knowledge integrates [cultural]{.mark},
[spiritual,]{.mark} and [ecological insights]{.mark} into managing and
conserving local environments. Indigenous peoples and their knowledge
systems offer holistic and local perspectives on climate risk
management, integrating cultural, intergenerational[, and place-based
understandings in Arctic ecosystems.4]{.mark}) Many Indigenous
communities live on and manage significant portions of the land in
Arctic regions and retain [vital ancestral knowledge and expertise in
conserving nature, protecting biodiversity, and addressing climate and
disaster risks through adaptation and mitigation
strategies.5]{.underline}) In many cases, their connection with the land
and their surrounding ecosystems is deeply rooted in spiritual and
cultural traditions that have evolved over millennia, offering a
distinct perspective on land stewardship that contrasts sharply with
values imposed by Western colonialism.

However, it is essential to recognize the diversity and complexity
within **[Indigenous communities]{.mark}**. While many Indigenous groups
emphasize sustainable practices and environmental stewardship, there are
significant variations in perspectives and approaches. Some [communities
[**support** resource **extraction projects like oil, gas, and mining
for economic benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while others strongly
oppose such activities to protect their lands and cultural heritage.
These differences highlight that Indigenous knowledge systems are not
monolithic but are shaped by distinct cultural, economic, and
environmental contexts[.**Indigenous communities**]{.mark} **[possess
traditional [ecological knowledge essential for
sustainably]{.underline}]{.mark}** [understanding and **[managing Arctic
environments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their practices, shaped by an
intimate relationship with the surrounding environment, [emphasizing
long-term sustainability]{.mark}. Most Indigenous governance systems
prioritize community well-being and environmental stewardship, making
them natural allies in climate resilience efforts.6) In this sense,
Indigenous knowledge systems are crucial for safeguarding biodiversity
and ecosystem services.7)

On Alaska's North Slope, [many of **the native Iñupiat do favour
drilling** both because they view their traditional practices as able to
coexist alongside industry]{.underline}, and also because the
institutional framework keeps many of the revenues within local
communities. Thanks to ANCSA, a significant proportion of revenues from
oil extraction funnel into Native communities (Huskey, 2018) although
there [are heated debates over the fairness of the distribution of those
revenues. Soon after ANCSA, Iñupiat leaders also pushed to establish
their own municipal government, the North Slope Borough, which is able
to tax the oil industry]{.underline}. In turn, [these taxes subsidize
modern schools and developments like the impressive Iñupiat Heritage
Center in Utqiaġvik, the North Slope's largest settlement]{.underline}.
Each year, whaling crews prepare their boats at the center, which also
hosts permanent displays celebrating the region's rich history. One
individual said to me, "We need development to continue because we don't
want our culture to go extinct."

To some individuals, then[, traditional livelihoods have come to depend
on the oil industry.]{.underline} This idea might seem paradoxical, but
in a way, even though the extraction of fossil fuels causes myriad
negative impacts on the environment and health, ANCSA and the North
Slope Borough's taxation powers have together helped ensure that at
least some of the benefits of extraction stay within the community. Back
in Borneo, when I asked one Penan activist what he thought the biggest
threat to his people's land rights was, he responded, "The law itself."
Its lack of clarity allows regulations to be manipulated to undermine
Penan rights, even customary ones, he elaborated.

Even in Alaska, however, laws that help locals capture the proceeds of
resource development can have pernicious effects[. ANCSA has contributed
to higher social inequality and unsustainable resource development in
places like Southeast Alaska, where the old growth temperate rainforest
has been clear-cut (Dombrowski, 2007)]{.underline}. In my own
encounters, one young man recounted -- with enthusiasm rather than
sadness -- memories of how the oil well where he worked was where his
grandparents had been born many decades ago, when it was just tundra.

In both Borneo and Alaska, development has arrived. Neither the Penan
nor the Iñupiat will return to their nomadic ways. Networks of pipelines
cover the Alaskan tundra, while in Borneo, gridded oil palm plantations
run right up against the rough edges of the dense, tangled jungle.
Still, despite development, the land continues to hold special meaning.
One Penan man described, "To me, the land is much more than the timber.
It's a culture, its music to the soul and it also sort of scenery that
you can draw for yourself. It's a lifeline for the Penan." Ensuring that
the people who live on the land maintain the right to draw the scenery
for themselves, so to speak, and realize the futures they envision --
whether or not development is involved -- critically depends on strong
legal frameworks.

Nevertheless, laws that promote the local accumulation of capital from
resource extraction may enhance support for and hasten the very
processes of development that reconfigure people's relationship to the
land. As Indigenous Peoples gain more rights around the world
(O'Faircheallaigh, 2013), their relationship to the land and the law
will undoubtedly change. [Examining the consequences of these shifts to
the legal and environmental landscapes will require further research
conducted in partnership with local communities, with results compared
across regions]{.underline} (e.g. Haley, 2004). Asia and the Arctic are
far apart, but comparing the experiences of Indigenous Peoples in the
face of global resource development may spotlight successful policies
and practices that can potentially be transferred across continents.

Introduction: Navigating Indigenous Rights and Mining in 2025

The intersection of Indigenous Rights and Mining remains a critical and
complex issue in 2025. As the global demand for minerals essential to
the green transition---such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth
elements---continues to surge, mining projects often unfold within
Indigenous territories. [Here, communities maintain unique cultural,
spiritual, and economic ties to their lands, making the balancing act
between development, environmental stewardship, and respect for
Indigenous sovereignty particularly sensitive.]{.underline}

[Throughout history and into the present, Indigenous Rights and Mining
have raised urgent questions about legal protections, environmental
impacts, socioeconomic opportunities, and the **path to equitable and
sustainable resource management**. The challenge lies in achieving
meaningful **consent**, ensuring that traditional livelihoods are not
disrupted, and that communities are **true partners** in **decisions**
related to their lands.]{.underline}

This in-depth blog will explore the modern landscape of Indigenous
Rights and Mining, examining historical context, legal frameworks,
environmental and social impacts, and actionable steps toward equitable,
sustainable mining practices for 2025 and beyond.

Historical Context and Contemporary Challenges of Indigenous Rights and
Mining

[Mining has historically proceeded with little regard for Indigenous
rights, resulting in widespread displacement, environmental degradation,
and social upheaval.]{.underline}

[Indigenous peoples worldwide have suffered the loss of land, pollution
of water sources, and the breakdown of traditional livelihoods dependent
upon hunting, fishing, and gathering. Despite key international
frameworks such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which emphasizes free, prior, and informed
consent (FPIC), the reality of implementation remains deeply uneven
across regions and countries.]{.underline}

Key challenges remain:

[**Marginalization** of **Indigenous** **voices** in decision-making
processes related to mining permits and operations]{.underline}

Lack of legal recognition and protection of Indigenous land rights

Environmental harm to water, soil, and biodiversity without meaningful
consultation or engagement

Persistent social and economic inequities for many communities despite
resource extraction from their territories

[In 2025, these challenges have become central to both global
sustainability ambitions and ongoing disputes between mining companies,
governments, and Indigenous groups. Navigating the path to equitable and
sustainable practices is fundamental to the future of Indigenous Rights
and Mining.]{.underline}

Legal and Policy Developments in Mining and Indigenous Rights

Increasing global attention in recent years has led to several countries
strengthening legal protections for Indigenous communities in the
context of mining. For instance, Canada and Australia have robustly
incorporated FPIC principles into their regulatory frameworks, requiring
mining companies to consistently engage with Indigenous groups from the
very earliest stages of project development.

Other significant policy evolutions include:

[The adoption of co-management and **benefit-sharing**
**agreements**---transforming Indigenous peoples from **obstacles to
partners** in resource management]{.underline}

A broader international push for corporate accountability, especially as
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics inform investment
decisions

The rise in Indigenous-led organizations asserting their rights using
political and legal tools, including litigation and involvement in
global forums

Increased scrutiny and enforcement mechanisms around responsible mining
practices for sustainable development

[Despite these advances, implementation of FPIC, fair benefit-sharing,
and environmental protections remain uneven, with many communities still
exposed to harm, displacement, and exclusion from meaningful
participation.]{.underline}

Environmental and Socioeconomic Implications of Mining in Indigenous
Territories

The environmental impacts of mining operations in Indigenous territories
are profound. These range from:

Deforestation and habitat destruction

Soil erosion, introducing instability and affecting traditional land
uses

Contamination of critical water sources, impacting villages and urban
settlements downstream

Loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecological stewardship held by
Indigenous peoples

Degradation of lands with spiritual and cultural significance

[At the same time, responsible mining that respects Indigenous rights
and implements robust environmental protections can deliver real
socioeconomic opportunities:]{.underline}

[Quality employment opportunities and training for local
communities]{.underline}

[Investment in infrastructure, education, and healthcare]{.underline}

[Equitable revenue-sharing that supports cultural resilience and
economic independence]{.underline}

[Empowerment of traditional knowledge in land management]{.underline}

[The balance between harm and opportunity, degradation and sustainable
management, is **shaped** by whether **Indigenous voices are at the
heart of decision-making processes**---with FPIC and strong legal
enforcement as critical levers.]{.underline}

"By 2025, [sustainable mining could reduce environmental impact by up to
30% in Indigenous territories with equitable practices."]{.underline}

The Path Forward: 5 Principles for Equitable Mining Practices

[To address the critical intersection of Indigenous Rights and Mining in
2025, we outline five guiding principles for equitable and sustainable
mining practices. These steps draw from international best practices,
legal frameworks, and lessons learned from decades of mining in
Indigenous territories.]{.underline}

[1. Recognition of Land Rights]{.underline}

[Ensuring that Indigenous land tenure and title are legally recognized
is foundational to protecting communities from involuntary displacement
and resource exploitation without consent.]{.underline}

[Legal recognition of lands safeguards against forced relocation and
exploitation]{.underline}

[Land rights serve as the cornerstone for economic security and cultural
survival within Indigenous communities]{.underline}

[Policy reforms must close gaps in ownership claims and clarify
jurisdiction over mining projects]{.underline}

Modern technology, like Farmonaut's real-time satellite monitoring
(large-scale resource management tools), can help governments and
Indigenous groups verify land use, deter illegal operations, and support
enforcement of land rights.

[2. Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)]{.underline}

[FPIC empowers Indigenous communities with the right to approve or
reject mining projects before work begins, based on transparent and
accessible information.]{.underline}

[**Consultation** must be ongoing, **culturally appropriate**, and in
languages that communities understand]{.underline}

[Consent cannot be tokenistic; participation must be meaningful and free
from intimidation or coercion]{.underline}

[Robust regulatory frameworks are needed to guarantee FPIC
implementation and address violations]{.underline}

[3. Environmental Protection and Traditional Knowledge]{.underline}

[**Integrating Indigenous environmental knowledge** with scientific
assessments **enhances the stewardship of lnds, water, and
biodiversity.**]{.underline}

[Indigenous **stewardship** practices, based on generations of
traditional knowledge, promote **restoration**, **biodiversity**, and
holistic resource management]{.underline}

[Collaborative **monitoring** and adaptive **management** strategies can
**minimize** **ecological** **harm**]{.underline}

[4. Benefit Sharing and Capacity Building]{.underline}

[**Mining**, when approached **equitably**, can help Indigenous
communities unlock **economic** **development** while **supporting**
cultural **priorities**.]{.underline}

[Mutually agreed benefit-sharing agreements distribute value fairly
(e.g., revenue, employment, local infrastructure)]{.underline}

[Capacity building---via education, training, and technology
transfer---**ensures communities can fully benefit and steward mining
outcomes**]{.underline}

[Investments in community capacity foster decision-making power over
both short- and long-term development]{.underline}

5\. Legal Enforcement and Corporate Accountability

Effective legal enforcement and transparent corporate behavior are
critical to preventing violations of Indigenous rights and environmental
standards.

Strengthened enforcement mechanisms ensure perpetrators of harm are held
accountable and that agreements are honored

Corporate transparency and strong ESG governance drive improved
practices in response to investor and consumer expectations

Tools like Farmonaut's blockchain-based traceability (traceability
solutions) provide a secure and auditable record of resource flows

Moving Forward: Equitable Resource Development for 2025 and Beyond

As the global economy pivots towards a future underpinned by critical
minerals for clean energy and technology---lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare
earth elements---the relationship between Indigenous Rights and Mining
only grows in significance.

Key takeaways for the present and future include:

[Recognizing and upholding Indigenous sovereignty is
indispensable---both for justice, and for aligning with international
legal expectations.]{.underline}

[**Genuine**, early **engagement** with Indigenous communities creates
the **foundation for equitable benefit-sharing and sustainable
development.**]{.underline}

[Environmental sustainability can be achieved by marrying traditional
knowledge with scientific and technological tools.]{.underline}

Corporate accountability and legal enforcement are crucial for raising
standards and ensuring community well-being.

[By following these principles and leveraging tech-driven insights, the
mining sector can promote responsible resource development, fuel
socio-economic opportunity, and minimize harm across Indigenous
territories. Industries, governments, and communities that prioritize
these guidelines will be better positioned to navigate the complexities
and demands of 2025 and beyond.]{.underline}

What are Indigenous Rights in the context of mining?

Indigenous Rights refer to internationally recognized legal principles
that protect the sovereignty, land, culture, and economic opportunities
of Indigenous communities. In mining, this includes the right to free,
prior, and informed consent (FPIC) over resource extraction, as well as
participation in economic benefits and environmental protection.

Why is FPIC important in mining projects involving Indigenous
territories?

FPIC empowers Indigenous peoples to meaningfully decide on mining
projects that may affect their lands and livelihoods. It ensures they
have the right to accept or refuse a project, based on full information,
without coercion, and prior to any resource exploitation.

How does mining affect Indigenous communities environmentally and
socially?

Mining can lead to ecosystem degradation, pollution, and loss of
traditional livelihoods if not properly managed. It may also bring
positive outcomes like employment and infrastructure when practices are
equitable and communities are partners in decision making.

What legal frameworks protect Indigenous Rights in mining?

Key legal frameworks include the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), national constitutions in
countries like Canada and Australia, and increasingly, regulatory
agencies that enforce FPIC and benefit-sharing agreements.

How can technology help achieve equitable mining practices?

Technology like satellite monitoring, AI analytics, and blockchain
traceability enhance transparency, accountability, and environmental
oversight, empowering all stakeholders to make informed, equitable
decisions and to verify responsible mining operations.

How do Indigenous communities benefit from sustainable mining?

[If respected, sustainable mining can bring investment, training,
employment, and infrastructure to Indigenous communities, helping to
strengthen economic autonomy and support cultural preservation, while
ensuring environmental stewardship.]{.underline}

Conclusion: Charting a Responsible and Equitable Path for Indigenous
Rights and Mining

The nexus of Indigenous Rights and Mining remains critical in 2025. [The
challenges and opportunities at this intersection demand a
collaborative, sustainable, and just approach]{.underline}---[one that
centers Indigenous sovereignty and leverages legal, technological, and
ethical principles for positive impact.]{.underline}

Navigating the path ahead will require unwavering respect, transparency,
and robust enforcement alongside new tools and frameworks. By embracing
these standards, we can transform the future of mining---[ensuring that
it serves as an engine not just for economic growth, but for the
resilience and prosperity of Indigenous communities
globally.]{.underline}

[Despite the **homogenizing assumptions**]{.underline} that are often
[projected onto Native Americans]{.underline} (e.g., [that indigenous
peoples\' values **always align** with the modern]{.underline} Western
[environmental movement]{.underline}), [scholars]{.underline} across
disciplines have [identified]{.underline} and explored [the **wide range
of perspectives** that Native nations and individuals hold on energy
development]{.underline}. Like any other community or group, divergent
views may arise because of differing priorities, perspectives, and
because any given project will have different distributional
consequences \[26,35--37\].

For instance, [scholars]{.underline} have [explored]{.underline} the
[cultural and social reasons for Diné coal workers\' support for
maintaining]{.underline} coal plant [operations, despite the
consequences to the]{.underline} local landscape, water resources,
public health, and the [climate]{.underline} \[35\]. In a series of
interviews, another analysis documented the wide range of concerns,
along with perceived economic opportunities, described by Diné peoples
related to energy development \[38\]. In the MHA Nation, leaders have
adopted the slogan "sovereignty by the barrel," reflecting the goal of
advancing tribal sovereignty through wealth gained from oil and gas
extraction on the reservation \[39\].

[One very high-profile symbol of these differing views is]{.underline}
the Dakota Access Pipeline ([DAPL]{.underline}), [through which 60 % of
the oil produced on the Fort Berthold reservation traveled in
2020]{.underline} \[40\]. DAPL garnered national media attention due to
the efforts of [activists from the Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe]{.underline}, who [opposed the pipeline]{.underline} largely due
to concerns over risks to drinking water \[41\]. [By contrast, **leaders
from the MHA Nation voiced support**]{.underline} for the pipeline\'s
operations, [citing]{.underline} the **[economic
consequences]{.underline}** of the pipeline being shut down \[40\].2
Views on DAPL likely vary considerably within the MHA nation, but this
example demonstrates how leaders across different tribes may disagree on
issues of energy development.

[Another]{.underline} example [comes from the Chaco Canyon area, a
center of pre-Columbian Pueblo culture]{.underline} for hundreds of
years that is now partly protected and managed by the federal Bureau of
Land Management as Chaco Culture National Park. [Oil and gas development
has occurred]{.underline} in the surrounding region [for
decades]{.underline}, but the Biden Administration has halted new
drilling within a 10-mile radius of the national park to protect
cultural resources \[43\]. Although this proposal has been supported by
some Native nations in the region \[44\], [the Navajo nation has argued
for a 5-mile radius to allow its members to produce]{.underline} more of
their [oil and gas]{.underline} resources [for the economic benefits
that development would provide]{.underline} \[45\].

[Energy development]{.underline} also [has **uneven effects** within
Native nations, and will lead to different perspectives within
tribes]{.underline}. For example, [the Bakken oil boom created
disparities between MHA members who signed lucrative oil and gas leases,
those who signed leases]{.underline} at [below market value, and those
who did not sign leases at all]{.underline} \[39,46\]. This diversity of
perspectives highlights the value of tribes making their own decisions
about energy, as outside entities may not understand the complex
dynamics within a tribe.

Indeed, [mining companies, governments, and environmental organizations
have]{.underline} at times [sought to use energy development and the
controversies it creates to **further their own interests**, regardless
of whether those]{.underline} interests [are well-aligned with
tribes]{.underline} \[26\]. Numerous analyses have also pointed out that
public perceptions of Native Americans, whether representative or not,
are used by stakeholders to advance their own narratives \[26,47\].

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0047117820948936

With these aims in mind, we start by examining a number of salient and
influential works in the field addressing global crises, including
['[global catastrophic risks]{.underline}' and ['human
extinction]{.underline}']{.mark}, demonstrating how they [[express
anxiety for, and]{.underline} **[seek to protect
whiteness]{.underline}**]{.mark}**.** The second section points to
[BIPOC futurisms]{.mark} that directly [challenge]{.mark} the
[futures]{.mark} circumscribed by whiteness and offer distinct forms [of
subjectivity, temporality]{.mark}, and [mobilities for responding
to]{.mark} ongoing [disaster]{.mark}. Throughout, we focus on how
futures are imagined, who imagines them and with whose flourishing in
mind in competing struggles for survival and thriving in (post-)
catastrophic worlds.

[[Discourses that predict]{.mark} the imminent '[end of]{.mark} the
[world']{.mark} are [not as universal as they]{.mark} often
[claim]{.mark} to be. The futures they fear for, seek to protect and
work to construct are rooted in a particular set of global social
structures and subjectivities: whiteness]{.underline}. Whiteness is not
reducible to skin pigmentation, genetics or genealogy. It is a set of
cultural, political, economic, normative, and [[subjective
structures]{.mark} derived [from Euro-centric societies]{.mark} and
propagated through global formations [such as colonization]{.mark} and
capitalism.]{.underline} These multi-scalar structures work by
**[segregate bodies through the inscription of racial
difference]{.mark},** [[privileging]{.mark} those they *recognize or
construct* as
['white'[^4^](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0047117820948936#fn4-0047117820948936) and]{.mark}

is also a form of

[accrues benefits]{.mark} -- including material, physical, and other
forms of security -- and pervasive forms of power, across space, time,
and social structures. Due in part to its trans-formation through
long-duration, global patterns of violence and conquest, [whiteness
takes unique forms wherever and whenever it coalesces, so it should not
be treated as universal]{.underline} -- despite its own internal claims
to this status. Most of the [leading [contributors
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [mainstream '[end of the world'
discourses]{.mark} discussed in this article are [rooted in]{.mark}
Euro-American cultural contexts]{.underline}, and in particular in
**[settler colonial]{.mark}** and/or imperial [states]{.mark} [such
as]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates[, Canada,
Australia,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom. As
such, [the forms of whiteness they embody are linked to particular
[histories of settlement, frontier cultures]{.mark}, [resource-based
imperialisms, **genocides of Indigenous communities**]{.mark}, histories
of slavery, and modes of anti-Blackness]{.underline}.

#### Extinction-first framing is biopolitical coercion --- it preserves settler futurity through genocidal extortion of indigenous peoples. Reject impact calculus that sidelines colonial violence --- confronting that violence is a prerequisite to solving any other form of destruction.

Extinction is not a metaphor... **[[Extinction]{.mark} has become [an
emblem of Western,]{.mark} and white-dominated, [fears about 'the end of
the(ir) world']{.mark}]{.underline}**. This scientific term is saturated
with emotional potency, [stretched and contorted [to embody]{.mark}
almost [any nightmare]{.mark}, from **climate change** to **asteroid
strikes**]{.underline}. In academic and public contexts alike, it is
regularly interchanged with other terms and concepts -- for instance,
['**species death**']{.underline}, global warming or **[ecological
collapse]{.underline}**. Diffused into sublime scales -- mass
extinctions measured in millions of (Gregorian calendar) years, a planet
totalized by the threat of **[nuclear destruction]{.underline}** --
['[extinction']{.mark} has become [an **empty superlative**]{.mark}, one
that that [gestures to]{.mark} an **[abstract]{.mark} form** of
[unthinkability]{.mark}. It [teases Western subjects with]{.mark} images
of generalized [demise that]{.mark} might, if it gets bad enough, even
[threaten]{.mark} us, or [the figure of **'humanity'**]{.mark} that we
enshrine [as]{.mark} a **[universal]{.mark}**. This figure of
'humanity', [derived from Western]{.mark} European enlightenment
[ideals]{.mark}, emphasizes individual, autonomous actors who are fully
integrated into the global market system; who are responsible citizens
of nation-states; who conform to Western ideas of health and
well-being]{.underline}; who partake of 'culture'; [who participate in
democratic state-based politics; who refrain from physical violence; and
who manage their 'resources' responsibly]{.underline} (Mitchell 2014).
Oddly, [**exposure** to the fear of extinction **contributes to the
formation** and bolstering of contemporary **Western
subjects**]{.underline}. [Contemplating the sublime destruction of
'humanity' offers the thrill of abjection: the perverse pleasure derived
from exposure to something by which one is revolted]{.underline}. Claire
Colebrook detects this thrill-seeking impulse in the profusion of
Western blockbuster films and TV shows that imagine and envision the
destruction of earth, or at least of 'humanity'. It also throbs through
a flurry of recent best-selling books -- both fiction and speculative
non-fiction (see Oreskes and Conway 2014; Newitz 2013; Weisman 2008). In
a forthcoming intervention, Noah Theriault and I (2018) argue that
[[these]{.mark} imaginaries [are a **form of porn** that **normalizes**
]{.mark}**the [profound violences driving extinction]{.mark}**[,]{.mark}
while [cocooning its viewers in]{.mark} the secure space of [the
voyeur]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Certainly, there are many Western
scientists, conservationists and policy-makers who are genuinely
committed to stopping the extinction of others, perhaps out of fear for
their own futures. Yet [extinction is **not** ]{.mark}**quite
[real]{.mark}** [for Western]{.mark}, and especially [white,
subjects]{.mark}; it is a fantasy of negation that evokes thrill,
melancholy, anger and existential purpose. [It is a **metaphor**]{.mark}
that expresses the destructive desires of these beings, and the
negativity against which we define our subjectivity]{.underline}. [But
**extinction is not a metaphor**: it is a very real expression of
violence that systematically destroys particular beings, worlds, life
forms and the relations that enable them to flourish]{.underline}. These
are real, unique beings, worlds and relations -- as well as somebody's
family, Ancestors, siblings, future generations -- who are violently
destroyed. [Extinction can only be used unironically as a metaphor by
people who have never been threatened with it, told it is their
inevitable fate, or lost their relatives and Ancestors to it -- and who
assume that they probably never will]{.underline}. This argument is
directly inspired by the call to arms issued in 2012 by Eve Tuck and
Wayne K. Yang and more recently by Cutcha Risling-Baldy. The first,
seminal piece demonstrates how [[settler]{.mark} [cultures **use**
]{.mark}**the [violence]{.mark} of metaphorical abstraction [to excuse
themselves]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the real work of decolonization:
[ensuring]{.mark} that land and [power is in Indigenous
hands]{.mark}]{.underline}. Risling-Baldy's brilliant follow-up extends
this logic to explain how First People like Coyote have been reduced to
metaphors through settler appropriation. In both cases, [engagement with
Indigenous peoples and their relations masks **moves to innocence**:
acts that make it appear as if settlers are engaging in decolonization,
[while]{.mark} in fact we are **[consolidating]{.mark}** the **[power
structures]{.mark}** that privilege us]{.underline}. In this series,
want to show how Western, and white-dominated, discourses on
'extinction' appear to address the systematic destruction of peoples and
other beings while enacting moves to innocence that mask their
culpability and perpetuate structures of violence. As I argued in Part I
of this series, [extinction is an expression of colonial violence. As
such, it needs to be addressed through direct decolonization, including
the dismantling of settler colonial structures of violence, and the
resurgence of Indigenous worlds]{.underline}. Following Tuck, Yang and
Risling-Baldy's lead, I want to show how and why [the violences that
drive extinction have come to be invisible within mainstream
discourses]{.underline}. Salient amongst these is the practice of
genocide against Indigenous peoples other than humans. ...it is
literally genocide. [What Western science calls ['extinction' is **not**
an]{.mark} unfortunate, [**unintended consequence**]{.mark} of desirable
'human' activities. [It is an embodiment of]{.mark} particular [patterns
of **structural violence**]{.mark} that disproportionately affect
specific racialized groups. In some cases, 'extinction' is directly,
deliberately and systematically inflicted in order to create space for
aggressors, including settler states]{.underline}. For this reason, it
has [rightly]{.underline} been [framed as an aspect or tool of colonial
genocides against Indigenous human peoples]{.underline}. Indeed, many
theorists have shown that the 'extirpation' of life forms (their total
removal from a particular place) is an instrument for enacting genocide
upon Indigenous humans (see Mazis 2008; Laduke 1999; Stannard 1994).
Specifically, the removal of key sources of food, clothing and other
basic materials makes survival on the land impossible for the people
targeted. Nehiyaw thinker Tasha Hubbard (2014) makes a qualitatively
distinct argument. She points out that the Buffalo are First People, the
elder brothers of the Nehiyaw people (and other Indigenous nations --
see Benton-Banai 2010). Starting in the mid-1800s, the tens of millions
of buffalo that ranged across Turtle Island were nearly eliminated
through strategic patterns of killing carried out by
settler-state-sponsored military and commercial forces. Their killing
was linked to governmental imperatives to clear and territorially annex
the Great Plains by removing its Indigenous peoples. As Hubbard points
out, methods of destroying buffalo herds included large-scale killing,
but also the disruption of their social structures, the destruction of
the ecosystems on which they rely, and the removal of calves. These acts
involve each of the components of the definition of genocide enshrined
in the UN Genocide Convention: (a) Killing members of the group; (b)
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c)
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to
bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing
measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly
transferring children of the group to another group. From Hubbard's
viewpoint, rooted in Nehiyaw philosophy and ethical-legal principles,
[the systematic destruction of the buffalo is not like genocide, nor is
it exclusively a tool for carrying out genocide against human peoples.
It is genocide in its own right: an attempt to destroy a particular
First People and the possibilities of its continuity]{.underline}. In
other words, the deliberate and systematic attempt to eliminate the
buffalo, enacted by settler states, [[**simultaneously** enacted
**genocide** against **Indigenous peoples** and their **nonhuman
relatives**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Genocides of Indigenous peoples
(human and otherwise) continue apace in contemporary settler states,
transformed into multiple manifestations. For instance, they are
integral to 'biosecurity' strategies designed to police the biological
boundaries of these states and their citizens]{.underline}. Laced with
racializing and xenophobic rhetoric (Subramaniam 2001), strategies such
as culling or planned eradications are intended to remove 'invasive' or
'foreign' life forms in order to protect 'Native' ones. Many of the
'invasive' life forms targeted for destruction were transported to
unfamiliar lands through colonial patterns of settlement and global
trade flows. However, this logic of elimination (Wolfe 2006) is often
perverted, turned against Indigenous\* beings whose flourishing impedes
the expansion or consolidation of the colonial state. For instance,
Deborah Bird Rose (2011 a, 2011 b) shows how this form of violence is
continually waged against flying foxes, who are framed by the settler
state as "pest\[s\] whose extinction is \[deliberately\] sought". This
act of elimination involves explicit genocidal ideation, or the
imagination of the destruction of a people. Rose characterizes it as a
"matter of imagining a world without \[dingoes or flying foxes\], then
setting out to create it" (Rose 2011a). The Australian settler state has
used multiple tactics to induce terror and preclude flourishing amongst
flying foxes, from the emission of high-pitched electronic signals to
smearing trees with python excrement (Rose 2011b). Indeed, in 2014, I
lived near to the roosting site of a group of flying foxes in Turrbal
and Jagera Country (suburban Brisbane to settlers). Such nesting places
are called 'colonies' , reflecting a Western scientific rhetoric that
frames Indigenous peoples as 'invaders' of the settler state. The trees
that housed the nesting site backed onto a municipal facility, whose
fence had been covered with barbed wire, in which many of the bats
snared their wings and starved to death. This
**['security']{.underline}** measure -- [designed to protect the
facilities relied upon by]{.underline} urban [settlers]{.underline} from
the intrusion of flying foxes -- [is a powerful weapon for precluding
ongoing flourishing of Indigenous other-than-human peoples]{.underline}.
I learned from neighbours that this 'colony' had previously been 'moved'
from several other sites around the city, suffering significant declines
in population each time. Indeed, despite reported declines of 95% in
flying fox communities in Queensland and neighbouring New South Wales,
the Queensland settler state legalized the shooting of the bats in 2012
by fruitgrowers. [Of course, in some cases, the elimination of life
forms is not as targeted or intentional -- it may [take the form of
land-based]{.mark} **extractive [violence]{.mark}**, the creep of
**[ocean acidification]{.mark}**, the [decimation of rainforests by
**climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Proponents of [a Eurocentric
definition of genocide]{.underline} could [argue that these events lack

#### Impact speculation over improbable extinction devalues real suffering --- sacrificing lives now for abstract futures is an unethical, mathematically incoherent framework.

Critiques of Existential Risk," *Project* Muse,

The theoretical models used by [existential risk]{.underline} analysts
[vacillate among deep time speculations, unknown risk horizons, and
policy making in the present.]{.underline} What kind of scientific
reasoning best fits these timescales and the "unprecedented" nature of
the events in question? The philosophers of existential risk deploy a
model of probability far more than actual calculation. But they promise
that their account of "possible" extinctions and the actions that will
help humans avoid them can and will have a quantitative foundation.
[Their claim is that low probability plus extinction-­ level significance
means we should care more about existential risks than anything
else]{.underline}---­ and that this level of analysis is truly the
ultimate priority of "effective altruism." In the case of avoiding
remotely probable ex istential risks, the benefits and [rewards are
postponed for a future distant enough that it will be hard for most to
care deeply about it,]{.underline} with the added complication that many
of these extinction scenarios might not be possible in the first place.
It would not be fair to say [that existential risk is fundamentally
incoherent when assessing risk probability and leave it at
that]{.underline}. But this caricature gets at something that we will
take up with more rigor in this chapter.

[The field of existential risk combines utilitarianism and probabilistic
risk analysis toward a fortuitous "ok" outcome (Bostrom's
"maxipok").]{.underline} On the one hand[, existential risk analysts aim
at the utilitarian goal of establishing the greatest good for the
greatest numbe]{.underline}r. On the other hand, they seek to use
mathematical prob- ability models to estimate the chance that a given
cause will lead to the extinction of humanity, or even of life in
general.2 The crux of existential risk analysis is the synthesis of
these two modes of calculative reasoning. But this crux is also a
failure: as we show in this section, existential risk analysis is
constituted by a radical mismatch between method and object of study.
This mismatch leads to a comic effect: the wonderfully strange spectacle
of serious philosophers (Bostrom), scientists (Sir Martin Rees), and
entrepreneurs (Elon Musk) [discussing how to mitigate the risk of deep
future extinction events as though they were calculating the probability
that one will die in a car accident based on ample statistics about the
frequency of such events in the past.]{.underline} The effect is similar
to that of Michael Madsen's documentary Into Eternity, when we watch
engineers become speculative philosophers as they ponder the one hundred
thousand-­ year time frame of their deep geological repository for
storing nuclear waste, especially when Madsen asks them what human
societies might be like in such a distant future.3 What [Mark McGurl
calls "posthuman comedy" is here the effect of rational solutions
applied to cover over the unthinkable, unimaginable, and uncontrollable
otherness of any future that stretches beyond a few human
generations]{.underline}.4

[Existential risk veers from "comic" analyses of extremely remote
scenarios, such as the "aestivation hypothesis" (aliens are sleeping so
as to wait billions of years for the universe to cool down enough to run
cosmic-­ size computers), to "tragic" assessments of the high near-­ term
likelihood of some massive extinction-­]{.underline} inducing event that
would be predictable but not avoidable.5 If we were to start calculating
the probability that a climate tipping point or AI will bring an end to
our evolutionary line, then not only would we be unable to arrive at a
reliable estimate that bears any analogy with, for example, finance or
insurance risk analysis, we wouldn't even know if the event is possible
in the first place. We would be trying to estimate the probability of
something that can only happen once, without any evidence to go on. [Not
only that, we would be trying to use this knowledge to act in a way that
will prevent it from]{.underline} [happening. Or at least, because
existential risk analysis operates within a fundamentally probabilistic
universe, the aim is to lower the fatal event's probability: the closer
to zero, the more immune humanity's potential will have
been.]{.underline}

For some, this might already be enough to dismiss the idea of rational
study of remote existential risk scenarios. As one AI re- searcher
reports, "I don't worry about \[AI induced extinction\] for the same
reason I don't worry about overpopulation on Mars."6 There is a common-­
sense idea that we should not spend too much time or too many resources
to prevent something when we don't know if it's possible (though Bostrom
and others would remind us that common sense is what prevents us from
seeing the implications of probability theory clearly enough to act). As
our characterization of existential risk's model of probability and
utilitarianism suggests, [we lean toward skepticism about the field's
claim to rationality and scientific rigor]{.underline}. For readers
steeped in critical theory, such a quantitative approach to politics,
ethics, and extinction may look to be another chapter of the dialectic
of Enlightenment, bound to end badly. But the epistemological
assumptions of existential risk should attract greater attention and
critique---­ not dismissal as another overreach of rationalism, but
analysis and historicization.

The Rhetoric of Probability

Writing for Vox, journalist Dylan Matthews covered the Effective
Altruism Global Conference at the Google campus in Mountain View,
California, in the summer of 2015. The title of his article---­ "I Spent
a Weekend at Google Talking to Nerds about Charity. I Came Away . . .
Worried"---­ divulges his take on the ideas and affects that circulated
at the meeting.7 "[Effective altruism" is the philanthropic practice of
attempting to do the greatest good through means that are efficient and
data-­ driven rather than sentimental.]{.underline} Many in the
existential risk community also subscribe to the effective altruism
movement, such as philosopher Toby Ord, founder of the society Giving
What We Can (a group admirably committed to donating at least 10 percent
of income). In Oxford, Bostrom's Future of Humanity Institute shares
office space with the Centre for Effective Altruism. Effective altruists
see themselves embracing "the cold, hard data necessary to prove what
actually does good."8 This makes the movement a candidate for study from
the perspective of science and technology studies, as an ethical
philosophy that claims for itself scientific imprimatur. Matthews says
that he identifies as an effective altruist; he also admits that "EA is
very white, very male, and dominated by tech industry workers."[9 The
topic of existential risk occupied center stage at the conference in
2015, and it gave him pause even as someone who embraces quantitative
ethics.]{.underline}

Matthews's skeptical account of this ["X-­ risk" takeover is a good
example of how existential risk combines fantastical, deep-­ time
probability calculations with utilitarian ethics]{.underline}. In the
example he cites, a panel featuring Bostrom and Musk, the starting point
for determining the greatest good for the greatest number of persons was
to calculate the greatest number of lives. The presenters did so not
with respect to a narrow time frame, as in the greatest number alive on
Earth today or during a 100-­ year period. Instead, they reasoned that if
humanity lasts "another 50 million years," then "the total number of
humans who will ever live is . . . 3 quadrillion."10 But they went on to
decide that this number fails to take into account future
extraterrestrial inhabitants of the solar system, "the potential value
of our posthuman future," or what Phil Torres calls the "astronomical
value thesis."11 Given the same arbitrary time scale of 50 million
years, they concluded that the number of people we need to take into
account is more like 1052 lives of 100 years each---­ a vastly greater
number than 3 quadrillion, so much greater that the mathematical
notation for exponents seems more accessible than obscure words like
sexdecillion.

Bostrom then shifts from such uncountable numbers to discussing the
ethical implications for us today: "Even if we give this 1054 estimate
'a mere 1% chance of being correct,' . . . we find that the expected
value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one
billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as
much as a billion human lives."12 As Matthews continues to paraphrase,

the number of future humans who will never exist if humans go extinct is
so great that reducing the risk of extinction by 0.00000000000000001
percent can be expected to save 100 billion more lives than, say,
preventing the genocide of 1 billion people. That argues, in the
judgment of Bostrom and others, for prioritizing efforts to prevent
human extinction above other endeavors. This is what X-­ risk obsessives
mean when they claim ending world poverty would be a "rounding error."13

Since we read this article, we have mentioned Matthews's rath- er
satirical report to a number of friends and colleagues. Their reaction
is always amusement at the comical absurdity of this scenario. They are
right, in a sense, but in this case the reductio ad absurdum of deep-­
time utilitarianism is strange because it is also perfectly rational, if
"rational" means consistent with the concept's thinkers like Bostrom
have applied. Notwithstanding their highly speculative assumptions about
the time scale of fifty million years and interplanetary travel, the
numbers reported by Matthews are faithfully deduced by combining
probability theory with the first principle of the mathematical ethics
of utilitarianism, even if the greatest "good" is reduced to mere
existence for the greatest number. This is the "effective" side of
effective altruism, now stretched to an unimaginable future.

In another example, Bostrom offers a box essay in Superintelligence
about the human lives and happiness that are really at stake when it
comes to the risk of malevolent AI. Different from Matthews's example,
he adds a quantification of happiness that goes beyond the negative
value of avoiding the foreclosure of countless future lives:

Assuming that the observable universe is void of extraterrestrial
civilizations, then what hangs in the balance is at least 10,000,000,00
0,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ,000 human
lives. . .. If we represent all the happiness experienced during one
entire such life with a single teardrop of joy, then the happiness of
these souls could fill and refill the Earth's oceans every second and
keep doing so for a hundred billion billion millennia. It is really
important that we make sure these truly are tears of joy.14

[This implied utilitarian calculus stretches the limits, to put it
mildly, of any known means of deciding how we should act, what is right
and wrong, and how to calculate the odds of a given
extinction]{.underline}. Yet they remain calculations. They have a
certain rationality despite the absurd ambition. They also provide the
foundations for a normative prescription for action, even if it reads
slightly tongue-­ in-­ cheek given the image of an ocean filled with tears
of joy. The aspiration here is to make an ethics of extinction avoidance
rational by grounding it in the relation between probability of a given
risk and the idea that doing the right thing means dividing the total
amount of total happiness, now and in the future, by the total number of
humans. [Working with such vast numbers is what gives the idea that even
slightly lowering the probability of an extinction event is worth
"astronomically" more than any justice achieved in the
present.]{.underline}

Another example of Bostrom's use of probability appears in the first
chapter of Superintelligence, where he posits that AI will reach human-­
level intelligence during our century. In this case, the evidence with
which to calculate such probabilities comes secondhand from surveys of
AI experts recalibrated by Bostrom. Rather than probabilities calculated
on the basis of known conditions such as the two sides of a coin or all
the data about car accidents used by insurance companies, we have
researchers guessing at probabilities, other researchers averaging them
out, and Bostrom reporting the results. So he is right to admit that
small sample sizes, selection biases, and---­ above all---­ the inherent
unreliability of the subjective opinions elicited mean that one should
not read too much into these expert surveys and interviews. They do not
let us draw any strong conclusion. But they do hint at a weak
conclusion. They suggest that (at least in lieu of better data or
analysis) it may be reasonable to believe that human-­ level machine
intelligence has a fairly sizeable chance of being developed by mid-­
century, and that it has a non-­ trivial chance of being developed
considerably sooner or much later; that it might perhaps fairly soon
thereafter result in superintelligence; and that a wide range of
outcomes may have a significant chance of occurring, including extremely
good outcomes and outcomes that are as bad as human extinction. At the
very least, they suggest that the topic is worth a closer look.15

[Bostrom rhetorically hedges several layers of uncertainty, writing not
just that we should take the numbers with a grain of salt, but that a
"weak conclusion" "suggests" that it "may be reasonable" to believe in a
"fairly sizeable" chance of the development of human-level
AI]{.underline}, "which might perhaps fairly soon" become
superintelligent, which could then mean a "significant chance" of human
extinction alongside the more neutral and optimistic possibilities. This
rhetoric of probability does not amount to anything very different from
an unguided estimate. More generously, we can say that the changing
opinions of experts allow for guesses that are easier to trust
secondhand, and that these guesses can be updated as new evidence
arrives. Yet they remain guesses about several things that we do not
know to be possible in the first place.

There would seem to be a qualitative difference between such
"probabilities" (if this is still the right term) that involve educated
guesses and secondhand surveys, and the kind of probabilistic risk
analysis that, though its conclusions remain uncertain, is able to use
data about real past events to calculate a probability. [Surveying the
expert community can tell us the probability that a given ex- pert will
believe in human extinction by AI, not the probability of the event
itself.]{.underline} Given Bostrom's hedging, we are not just dealing
with uncertainty but, what is more abstract, rhetorical play with
uncertainty about uncertainty. We would have to be very generous readers
to grant that there is some truth to these forecasts when the author is
explicitly telling us not to read much into them[. Given the
fundamentally speculative nature of extinction scenarios, such guesswork
is understandable. The problem is when it is also treated as
"scientific" and "rational" grounds for political policy---­ even as the
only grounds worth mentioning.]{.underline}

*4.5. Shareholder Mode: the North Slope of Alaska, USA*

The Alaska [**North Slope benefit sharing regime** is based on
investment, compensation, and charity principles]{.underline}
administered by different actors, such as: the North Slope Borough,
Native villages and village corporations, oil companies, and state and
federal governments. The [unique mode of benefit sharing in Alaska is
the shareholder mode]{.underline}, although it is mixed with others: the
paternalistic, CCSR, and partnership modes. All types of mechanisms are
also present.

In Alaska there are several layers of benefit sharing, the most
essential and unique mechanism being the shareholder mode, which is
twofold. On the one hand, through the Alaska Permanent Fund (Sovereign
Wealth Fund), every citizen of Alaska receives a share of money from the
oil income \[**38**\]. On the other hand, [indigenous Alaskans are
shareholders of regional and village corporations]{.underline}, which
appeared in the framework of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act
(ANCSA) \[**5**\]. Approximately [80,000 Alaskans are currently enrolled
in Native corporations]{.underline}. In 1971, corporation membership was
open to any resident who has at least "quarter blood" (had at least one
Native grandparent), with an option to join one regional and one village
corporation. Each shareholder who was born before 1971 received 100
shares. Those who were born after 1972 were supposed to inherit shares
later or receive them as gifts. Further decision-making about sharing
with "afterborns" differed from corporation to corporation and depended
on shareholders' vote and/or board decisions. For instance, the Arctic
Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC) made a positive decision on this
issue, and the number of shareholders grew from 3700 at the time of
establishment to 13,000 in 2018. Village corporations on the North Slope
of Alaska decided not to provide shares to members born after 1972. This
decision entailed intra-generational inequalities that emerged over
time.

Under the stipulations of ANCSA, the Alaska regional corporations [share
income from resource revenues with each other]{.underline}. This is due
to the fact that some corporations own the land rich with oil and
minerals, while others do not. Seventy percent of a corporation's income
coming from resource extraction on Native Alaskans' lands received via
ANCSA are shared with other regional corporations (ANCSA 7i provision).
In the North Slope, the ASRC contracts with many oil companies and
receives royalties from oil extraction on Native-owned land. Village
corporations own the surface title to the land, receive royalties
through surface-use agreements and contract oil field services from oil
companies. This money is also partly distributed to shareholders. ASRC,
along with the village corporations, is overseeing the mineral-rich
lands and controls the development of resources by leasing mineral-rich
lands to oil companies. As a result, the corporation provides jobs to
its members.

[Other benefits include state revenues coming from oil companies'
royalties plus the production and corporate **income taxes**, which are
partly distributed to communities via state grants and revenue
sharing.]{.underline} The indigenous-run municipality, the North Slope
Borough (which operates under the state of Alaska), is distributing
money from taxation of oil infrastructure to communities. These
state-led benefit sharing arrangements are top down and paternalistic.
Finally, transnational corporations, such as Conoco-Phillips and
ExxonMobil, pursue CCSR mixed with the partnership mode. They are
committed to strategic investments in education, training, and capacity
building in indigenous communities. [This funding is channeled through
direct sponsorship or grants to **indigenous** and non-indigenous
**nonprofits**.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration said on Monday that it planned to eliminate
federal protections across millions of acres of Alaskan wilderness, **a
move that would allow drilling and mining in some of the last remaining
pristine wilderness in the country.**]{.underline}

[Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the Biden administration had
**exceeded** its **authority** last year when it banned oil and gas
drilling in more than half of the 23 million-acre area, known as the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska]{.underline}.

[The proposed repeal is part of President Trump's aggressive agenda to
"**drill, baby, drill**," which calls for **increased oil and gas
extraction on public lands** and the **repeal of virtually all climate
and environmental protections.**]{.underline}

["We're **restoring the balance** and putting our energy future back on
track," Mr. Burgum said in a statement.]{.underline}

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is an ecologically sensitive
expanse of land about 600 miles north of Anchorage, bounded by the
Chukchi Sea to the west and the Beaufort Sea to the north. It is the
largest single area of public land in the United States. It covers
crucial habitat for grizzly bears, polar bears, caribou, thousands of
migratory birds and other wildlife.

Created in the early 1900s, the reserves were originally envisioned as a
fuel supply for the Navy in times of emergency. But in 1976, Congress
authorized full commercial development of the federal land and ordered
the government to balance oil drilling with conservation and wildlife
protection.

[Mr. Burgum accused the Biden administration of prioritizing
"obstruction over production and undermining our ability to harness
domestic resources at a time when American energy independence has never
been more critical."]{.underline}

The announcement came as Mr. Burgum traveled to Alaska, accompanied by
Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
and Chris Wright, the secretary of the Energy Department. The three were
expected to encourage companies to drill in sensitive areas like the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to support a liquefied natural gas
pipeline in the state.

**[The plan to allow drilling in the petroleum reserve drew praise from
the oil industry.]{.underline}**

Emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the main driver of
climate change, which is heating the planet and creating dangerous new
weather patterns. Alaska is warming at a rate two to three times as fast
as the global average, resulting in thawing permafrost and melting sea
ice. It is also disrupting the hunting, fishing and food-gathering
practices of Indigenous communities.

[The group supports allowing oil and gas projects in the region, and Mr.
Harcharek said the visit by Mr. Burgum and others "shows the federal
government sees our communities and people as partners, not a

Others said opening up the reserve threatened to destroy habitat for
caribou and thousands of migratory birds, and would put communities that
depend on subsistence hunting at risk.

"This is very concerning to us," said Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, a former
mayor of the predominantly Inupiaq city of Nuiqsut.

Matt Jackson, the Alaska State senior manager at The Wilderness Society,

environment. The oil and gas lease sale did not draw any bids from
companies. [Trump further orders the **prioritization of the
development** of Alaska's liquified natural gas (LNG) potential,
including permitting all necessary pipeline and export infrastructure
related to the Alaska LNG Project.]{.underline} Last week, High North
News reported that the proposed Alaska LNG project has passed its next
hurdle: the signing of a development agreement. The \$44bn project would
see Alaska export up to 20 million tonnes of LNG annually starting in
2031. The order also includes instructions to rescind policies
concerning the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. In April 2024, the
Biden administration finalized legislation to ban fossil fuel drilling
in nearly half of the reserve, located in the northwestern parts of the
state. While the Executive Order aims to reverse many restrictions
imposed by the previous administration, particularly with regard to oil
and gas development, there is still uncertainty about whether future
projects will unfold. Potential bidders and oil companies must consider
factors such as the oil price, cost of development, and reputational
risk.

Robert G. **Boutilier**, 8-30-20**14** \[Robert G. Boutilier, Centre for
Sustainable Community Development, c/o Faculty of Environment, Office of
the Dean, Simon Fraser University, 8-30-2014, "Frequently asked
questions about the social licence to operate," Impact Assessment and
Project Appraisal, accessed 7-24-2025 // ava :)\]

If a project is advancing or operating, why worry about the level of
social licence it has?

[Senior professionals in the mining industry see the social licence as a
continuous process that must be sustained over the life of the
project]{.underline} (Parsons et al. Citation2014). In practice,
however, site-level line managers can fall into debates about whether or
not a project\'s social licence needs to be improved. One side argues
for the benefits of a higher social licence, while the other argues that
as long as the project is operating, it has all the social licence it
needs, and perhaps all the social licence that can profitably be had.

The question of what level of social licence a project proponent or
operator should seek is distinct from the question of what levels it is
possible to seek. The former is a strategic question that can only be
answered by taking account of the specific circumstances of each
project. The latter is a theoretical question that has already received
some attention. Boutilier and Thomson\'s (Citation2011) model proposes
four levels of social licence (i.e. withholding, acceptance, approval,
psychological identification) separated by three boundary criteria (i.e.
legitimacy, credibility, full trust). Each level is associated with
different costs and benefits. Generally, [socio-political risks decrease
as the level of social licence rises.]{.underline} For project
proponents and operators, the practical implications of graduated levels
of social licence translate into corresponding degrees of restricted
access to resources. In linking the social licence to resource
dependence theory, Thomson and Boutilier (Citation2011) note that the
resources can be anything from raw materials and water to skills and
financing. The restricted access can take the forms of higher costs,
longer delays or complex resource access protocols that raise
administrative costs.

Research indicates that [seeking a higher level of social licence beyond
the bare minimum can be a strategy for controlling costs. Each year more
empirical evidence is published demonstrating how stakeholder discontent
can translate into several categories of costs for
businesses]{.underline} (Franks et al. Citation2014). Davis and Franks
(Citation2011), for instance, examined perceptions of what categories of
costs were most affected by social conflicts in mining. [The biggest
cost category by far was 'staff time spent on risk and conflict
management'.]{.underline} Studies of extractive industries more broadly
(Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Citation2009) have found that
[sustainability issues are implicated in 70% of project delays on the
largest capital investment projects. This exceeds the delays owing to
commercial (63%) and technical (21%) factors.]{.underline} A study of
gold mining firms (Henisz et al. Citation2013) found that up to half of
the discount on the value of the gold companies had in the ground, as
reflected in their stock market valuations, depended on the level of
conflict or cooperation with stakeholders. [Stakeholders do not need to
completely close down an operation to have an impact on the financial
value of a company. A reduction in the level of social licence is
sufficient.]{.underline}

### Corporate Backlash\-\--Link Turn\-\--2AC

#### Engaging with Indigenous communities is not costly\-\--it actually increases the scope of solvency. 

**McCarthy et al 25**, \*School of Environment, Resources and
Sustainability, University of Waterloo. (Daniel D. P. McCarthy,

L'Hommecourt, Bori Arrobo, Gregory Hill, 6-8-2025, \"Shifting the

First, [the]{.underline} [cost of meaningfully engaging with local
Indigenous communities on mine closure and reclamation is
**insignificant** relative to mine operations and mine closure
expenditures]{.underline}. The actual cost of executing reclamation is
different than including Indigenous Peoples in planning for reclamation.
The average cost to reclaim an oil sands mine ranges from CAD 10,000 to
CAD 320,000 per hectare depending on the materials being reclaimed
(e.g., treated or untreated fine tailings, coarse tailings, overburden,
process water, etc.) and the ecosystem types (e.g., lake, forest,
wetland) \[**61**,**63**\]. Experimental wetland reclamation costs have
been cited as high as CAD 926,000 per hectare \[**63**\]. In contrast, a
multistakeholder group costs less to operate annually than the cheapest
average reclamation cost per hectare (i.e., \<CAD 10 k). For example,
[it cost the CEMA approximately CAD 5 M per year to operate five working
groups with **industry**, **government**, **Indigenous community**, and
**NGO representation**, which included over one hundred participants,
and to co-create reclamation and other cumulative effects guidance
documents]{.underline} \[**64**\].

[Beyond the cost of engagement, the inclusion of contributed IK and
recommendations into future mine closure and reclamation plans is
**unlikely** to translate into significantly increased
reclamation]{.underline} **[operational costs]{.underline}.** [Mine
waste will still need to be treated, landforms graded, soils moved and
placed, and vegetation, wildlife habitats, and traditional land uses
established as per provincial regulatory requirements.]{.underline} The
[inclusion and participation of Indigenous communities]{.underline}
means there [will be more local and relevant information to inform
future plan iterations to increase the likelihood of achieving
post-closure traditional land use capability, trust, and reclamation
certification]{.underline}. Discussion points and recommended changes by
Indigenous communities have typically included the following: holistic
or landscape-level perspectives; cultural reconnection (e.g., community
monitoring metrics); different ecosystem or ecosite and landform
configurations (e.g., orientations that support natural wildlife
migrations); different wildlife and revegetation strategies (e.g., more
of different culturally significant species); and the renewal of special
places and features (e.g., traditional trails, camps, traplines, etc.),
which are currently lacking in the oil sands industry's life of mine
closure plans \[**50**\]. Thus, [the cost of doing this work in a "good
way" with Indigenous communities is **unlikely** to significantly
increase the **average operational cost**.]{.underline}

### Corporate Backlash\-\--Econ!D\-\--2AC

#### Decline doesn't cause war.

**Saltzman '23** \[Ilai; Ph.D in International Relations, University of
Haifa, Postdoctoral research fellow at the International Security
Program (ISP), Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, John
F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Director of the
Gildenrhon Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Maryland,
College Park; Chinese Political Science Review; February 13;
"Diversionary Words: Trump, China and the COVID-19 Pandemic"; vol. 9;
pp. 85--109\]

Diversionary wars, according to Amy Oakes (2012, 14), are "interstate
wars initiated in large part to bolster the government against growing
domestic opposition, rather than simply promote the national interest."
Greg Cashman (2013, 200) similarly asserted that "[when states are beset
by increasing political opposition and civil strife or by deteriorating
economic conditions, their leaders will seek to solve these internal
woes by initiating conflict with an external foe]{.underline}." Jaroslav
Tir (2010, 413) also argued that "[[under]{.mark} conditions such as
**[econ]{.mark}omic [adversity]{.mark}**]{.underline} or political
unrest, [[the]{.mark} country's [leader may]{.mark} attempt to generate
a foreign policy crisis in order both to **[divert]{.mark}** domestic
discontent and bolster their political fortunes **[through a rally
around the flag]{.mark} effect**]{.underline}." Thus, diversionary wars
are multifunctional: they can distract from domestic woes, boost
popularity, shift blame or demonstrate competence when leaders face
challenging domestic circumstances (Oakes 2012, 14--15).Footnote4

Furthermore, Jaroslav Tir and Michael Jasinski (2008) have successfully
shown that embattled leaders may also direct their diversionary tactics
against domestic audiences, especially against minorities and other
vulnerable communities. Given their role as intermestic figures who make
decisions in both the international and the national domains, leaders
can try and mobilize domestic support by embarking on an armed conflict
abroad and uniting the political base (in-group) against those elements
within society the leader had shown political, ideological, ethnic or
cultural dislike or hostility towards (out-group).Footnote5 Thus, waging
a diversionary war abroad, and targeting or suppressing the outgroup at
home, are not mutually exclusive policies; leaders can pursue such
policies simultaneously depending on the degree of duress they are
experiencing as well as the availability of opportunities to leverage.
As Jung (2014, 566) aptly stated, "diversionary action is a rational
decision made by domestically vulnerable leaders whose primary concern
is for personal political survival".Footnote6

[As the theory evolved over the years, especially in response to various
**[critiques of]{.mark} its [empirical applicability]{.mark}**, scholars
began exploring **nonviolent diversionary** policies leaders may
pursue]{.underline} including socioeconomic interventions ([Kisangani
and Pickering 2007]{.underline}) and rhetorical threats ([Ala'
Alrababa'h and Lisa Blaydes 2021]{.underline}; [Carter
2020]{.underline}; [Li et al. 2009]{.underline}). These works suggested
that [**[given]{.mark} domestic [unrest]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
degree of **[threat]{.mark} it poses [to leaders]{.mark}** varies in
intensity, diversionary **armed [conflict is not]{.mark} necessarily the
most [appealing]{.mark} response**.]{.underline} Whereas the greater the
threat domestic unrest constitutes for leaders, the more prone they will
be to launch an armed conflict, lower levels may entice either a
short-of-war or an entirely nonviolent diversionary approach (Hagan
1986; Morgan and Bickers 1992, 32). Furthermore, [armed [conflict
is]{.mark} an extremely **[costly]{.mark}** and **risky** endeavor [and
leaders]{.mark} may [neither possess]{.mark} the **[legitimacy nor
resources]{.mark}** necessary [to embark]{.mark} on a diversionary armed
conflict, either limited or
**[large-scale]{.mark}**.]{.underline}Footnote7 Considering the
fluctuating degree of threat and/or capacity, [Oakes]{.underline} (2012,
17) [correctly recognized several alternative diversionary policies that
[leaders]{.mark} may [consider]{.mark} when facing a domestic crisis in
addition to warfare: diversionary spectacle, repression,
**[political]{.mark}**]{.underline} and economic [[reforms]{.mark},
foreign intervention, [and **muddling**]{.mark}
**through**]{.underline}.

The identification of additional responses embattled leaders may pursue
in face of a domestic crisis should be applauded but the incorporation
of a rhetorical variant is still underdeveloped in the literature,
although it can serve the same diversionary function without the
application of military force and with significantly less risk as well
as cost. Therefore, the existing menu of diversionary policy options
should be expanded to include it (see Fig. 1). Unlike the violent
militarized variant of diversionary war which utilizes foreign
interventions to achieve a diversionary objective, a communicative
nonviolent diversionary approach is essentially discursive, and it
pertains to oral or written statements as well as other forms of
messaging through traditional and/or novel platforms such as social
media which play a significant role in any deflection efforts.Footnote8
In other words, [the diversionary use of **physical military
[force]{.mark}** [is substituted by]{.mark} the **diversionary use of
[rhetoric]{.mark}al exchanges**]{.underline}.

**Bureau of Land Management**, **n.d.** \[Bureau of Land Management,
n.d., \"Oil and Gas Program in Alaska,\"
https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/about/alaska,
accessed 7-14-2025 // ava :)\]

Oil and gas development has shaped Alaska and its economy, with
significant potential ahead for further growth and development. [[The
BLM supports]{.mark} responsible [development]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[Federal public lands through administration of the Federal onshore oil
and gas leasing program and permitting]{.mark} geophysical [exploration,
drilling, and construction]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark} [oil and gas
projects]{.mark}. This program currently covers three regions,
stretching from Southcentral Alaska to the North Slope: the Cook Inlet
Region on both sides of the Cook Inlet, the approximately
23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A), and the
approximately 1.6-million-acre Coastal Plain of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).]{.underline}

[[In Alaska, the BLM oversees]{.mark} the [production]{.mark} of
millions of cubic feet [of natural gas]{.mark} [and]{.mark} millions of
barrels of [oil]{.mark} [annually]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Cook Inlet
has four production units (Beaver Creek, Beluga River, Kenai, Swanson
River) while the NPR-A has five (Bear Tooth, Mooses Tooth, Colville
River, Horseshoe, Umiat). [These units contribute significantly to
America's balance sheet, through [annual lease rentals and
royalties]{.mark} [on]{.mark} oil and gas [production]{.mark} that
[companies pay to the U.S. Treasury via the D]{.mark}epartment
[o]{.mark}f the [I]{.mark}nterior['s ­­Office of Natural Resource
Revenue]{.mark}.]{.underline} These projects also generate revenue for
the State of Alaska, which receives 90% of rents and royalties from
leases in the Cook Inlet Region and 50% of the bonus bids, rents, and
royalties from both the NPR-A and Coastal Plain.

COOK INLET: Onshore exploration and production in the Cook Inlet Region
began in the 1950s, starting with Swanson River Unit. It was pivotal in
demonstrating Alaska's economic viability to become a state, and it
continues to contribute to Alaska\'s economic and energy needs today.
Natural gas produced from this region is a vital resource for Anchorage
and communities across Southcentral Alaska. All gas-fired electric
plants in Southcentral rely on Cook Inlet as their fuel source.

NPR-A: The 23-million-acre NPR-A is an important resource for meeting
America\'s energy needs. The last lease sale in this area was held in
2019, and more lease sales are planned for the near future. The current
period of exploration, which began in 1999, has resulted in the
discovery and development of Colville Delta (CD) 5, Greater Mooses Tooth
1 and 2, as well as the Willow project (currently under construction,
with first oil planned for 2029). There has been increasing interest in
NPR-A in recent years, and the area still presents enormous opportunity
for additional resource exploration and development. Discoveries in the
Nanushuk and Torok formations have piqued interest as local and regional
geology and geophysics are reexamined. These targets continue to fuel
exploration and development opportunities (alongside other historical
subsurface targets of interest) for the near future in NPR-A. Current
discoveries and analysis indicate that there may be 8.7 billion barrels
of recoverable oil and 25 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas in
known prospects of the reserve.

COASTAL PLAIN: For many decades, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) has captured significant attention for
its untapped oil and gas development potential. In 2017, the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act (Public Law 115-97) changed that, by directing the
Secretary of the Interior, through the BLM, to establish and administer
a competitive oil and gas program for the Coastal Plain and to offer at
least two lease sales of at least 400,000 acres by December 2024. The
Tax Act directed that the program be managed similar to the
administration of lease sales under the Naval Petroleum Reserves
Production Act of 1976. The first lease sale in the Coastal Plain was
held on January 6, 2021, and received bids on 11 of 22 tracts. Under
Executive Order 14153, \"Unleashing Alaska\'s Extraordinary Resource
Potential,\" the BLM is working to expand oil and gas leasing in this
area and, with more lease sales planned for the near future.

BLM posts information on its lease sales in Alaska on its Alaska Oil and
Gas Leasing Program webpage.

\[Alaska Department of Natural Resources, n.d., "Fact Sheet: Mining on
State-selected Land in Alaska," Alaska Department of Natural Resources,
https://dnr.alaska.gov/mlw/cdn/pdf/factsheets/mining-on-state-selected-land.pdf,
accessed 7-14-2025 // ava :)\]

What is State-Selected Land?

[[State-selected land is **federal land** that the state has applied for
as part of its statehood entitlement]{.mark}. The term state-selected
land [refers to land for which the **State has NOT received**
conveyance]{.mark} [through]{.mark} [tentative approval]{.mark} or
patent [from the federal government]{.mark}. **[This land does not
belong to the State]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Can a mining claim be staked on State-selected land?

[When the State of Alaska files a land selection, that land is closed to
federal claim staking.]{.underline} However, Alaska Statute 38.05.275
allows State mining claims to be staked on such land.

Is it risky for a miner to stake a State claim on State-selected land?

[Yes. [The federal government may restrict or deny access to claims on
State-selected land]{.mark}. (Remember, **[this land]{.mark} still
[belongs to the federal government]{.mark}**.)]{.underline} Furthermore,
you will lose all rights to your claim under State law if the State
never gets title to the land -- a risk that is especially high if the
land has also been selected by a Native Corporation under the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Also, through the over selection
process, the State was allowed to select 25% more land than it is
entitled to receive. Thus, large amounts of selected land will never go
into State ownership.

What is the advantage of my staking a claim on State-selected land?

[The staking of a claim on State-selected land establishes a preference
right for a state mining claim prior to the State acquiring full title
to the land from the Federal government.]{.underline} If the locator
complies with the State's requirements for maintaining the claim when/if
the land is conveyed to the State from the federal government, then the
locator's preference right may be used to establish senior mineral
rights against another State locator's claims.

When will I be able to mine a claim located on State-selected land?

[[The date the State receives conveyance]{.mark} of the selection [from
the federal government]{.mark} will be the date that [your right to the
possession and extraction of locatable minerals under State law]{.mark}
will [begin, provided that the terms of federal approval]{.mark} or
classification by the State [do not prohibit mineral
location.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Do I need to perform assessment work on a claim staked on State-selected
land?

[Because **the State does not own the land** on which your claim is
staked, the Division of Mining, Land & Water cannot require you to
perform assessment work on your claim before it is conveyed to the
state.]{.underline} Your obligation to comply with the statutes and
regulations governing mining in the State of Alaska begins on the date
the State receives conveyance of the selection. Therefore, your
assessment year begins on the first day of September following the date
the State receives conveyance.

When do I pay annual rent for a claim on State-selected land?

The first annual rental year for a location on State-selected land
begins on the date of conveyance and ends at noon the following
September 1. The first rental payment is due within 90 days of the date
of conveyance. It is your responsibility to know the date of conveyance.
You may make a non-refundable deposit of \$25 for each location made on
State-selected land by following State regulation 11 AAC 86.107 or
regulation 11 AAC 86.215(f). The department will credit the deposit to
the first annual rental payment if the State receives conveyance to the
selection.

Will the Division of Mining, Land & Water inform me when the State
receives conveyance to the land where my claim is located?

No. The division will make every attempt to contact you at the address
provided, but If you do not keep the State informed of any change in
your address, you may not receive notification when the land has been
conveyed to the State. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to know
when the State receives conveyance to the land on which your claim is
located. We advise you to check regularly with the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) or the State Mining Information Offices listed below to
find out whether the land has been conveyed to the State of Alaska.

Will my claim on State-selected land be plotted on State status plats?

Yes. Your claim will be plotted on State status plats as soon as
possible. However, all documents pertaining to your claim (location
certificate, affidavits of annual labor, etc.) will be accepted by this
office for filing purposes only and will not be reviewed until the State
receives conveyance.

Planning by Local Governments

Title 29 of the Alaska Statutes requires that home rule, first and
second class boroughs, unified municipalities, and first class and home
rule cities outside of boroughs provide planning, platting, and land use
regulation. For information on local governments, visit the Mapping,
Analytics, and Data Resources or visit the Plans Library.

### Paternalism Defecit\-\--2AC

#### State-led benefit sharing is paternalistic and dictated by corporations, only co-management solves for indigenous needs.

Mandated benefits are associated with specific acts of legislation or
regulation. Mandated benefits are often taxes and royalty payments to
the state or to the community in case the company is using federal,
state, or community land \[42\]. Companies must pay taxes, and tax
distribution is based on national, regional, or local legislation.
Another typical example of mandated benefits is the Alaskan permanent
fund that distributes money from oil rent to every Alaskan citizen, and
the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act (ANCSA) requirements; 70% of the
money from resource extraction in the Alaska Native Regional
Corporations have to be shared with other regional native corporations
\[8\]. [Negotiated benefits are an eclectic group of arrangements
between]{.underline} companies and regional, district, and municipal
authorities, or between [companies and communities]{.underline}. For
example, the impact benefit agreement (ABI) that is common in Canada
\[43\]. In Russia, the federal, or more often, regional authorities
imposed and negotiated socio-economic cooperation agreements both
formally and informally as a legacy of the Soviet state practices
\[19\]. The post-Soviet practice encompasses a system where the
extractive industry fulfils a part of the normal state functions. [The
negotiation of benefits becomes centralized even though the local
government is active in requesting benefits from these
negotiations**.**]{.underline} **[This system gives little voice to the
community]{.underline}**, and **[mostly serves the interests of the
state in its interpretation of the local needs]{.underline}** \[19\].
Negotiated benefit-sharing happens when foreign investors or partners
impose requirements on lending entities. Regional extractive companies
may be open to such loans and partnerships in order to get access to
capital. **[Lenders]{.underline}**, such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), **[put conditions which require
benefit-sharing]{.underline}**. **[However, benefit-sharing may not be
well connected to real community needs]{.underline}** and **[faces
implementation challenges]{.underline}**, if these standards do not
conform to the local realities \[20\]. [In Alaska, voluntary
local/indigenous employment quotas]{.underline} and hiring preferences
negotiations [take place,]{.underline} yet **[the company makes the
final decision]{.underline}** on them. The **[common practice in Alaska
is contractual agreements and royalty payments for using private land,
which]{.underline}** native **[corporations]{.underline}** and oil
companies **[negotiate]{.underline}**. The semi-formal mechanism of
benefit-sharing occurs when a company responds to community actors',
local authorities', or private citizens' requests often **[without much
transparency or]{.underline}** public **[participation]{.underline}**.
Companies are selective in their replies to certain local petitions,
which helps them in risks avoidance. The [decision-making power always
rests with corporate leadership]{.underline}, and is **[often perceived
as the company's goodwill, to which a local community is not formally
entitled.]{.underline}** From a company's standpoint, this is a "social
expenditure" embedded in its role as a dominant local economic actor.
The trickle-down benefit mechanism includes gains the community
experiences from general economic impacts, such as income growth,
employment, increased consumer spending, new infrastructure development,
procurement through indigenous, and local businesses and the creation of
local jobs. Trickle-down benefits are typically unspecified in
benefit-sharing agreements, are not based on companies' strategy, and
emerge due to the multiplier e ect in the economy or increases in cash f
lowin local consumption \[18\].

### Alaska Bad\-\--2AC

#### Alaskan mandates are rooted in colonialism.

The [paternalistic mode often involved mandated benefits, especially
from the state agencies, which jeopardizes procedural
equity]{.underline}, although distributive equity may be su cient
\[77\]. In Alaska, scholars perceive paternalism in relationships
between governments and Indigenous Peoples as [rooted in
colonialism]{.underline} \[78\]. Despite tribes being federally
recognized as self-determination entities that have "government to
government" relationship with both federal and state agencies, in
practice, they experience patronage, coming from the state, which only
pretends to acknowledge self-determination by natives \[79\]. [A
vice-chair of Gwich'in Council describes the process as "the federal
government consults the tribal people to some degree]{.underline}, but I
would [not]{.underline} say it's [a consent driven process.]{.underline}
A lot of times, [consultation means "we will hear you, but not
necessarily listen to you, and not necessarily incorporate your
desires]{.underline}" \[80\]. As it was described earlier, benefits for
communities are allocated through the state of Alaska and the North
Slope Borough (NSB), both of which receive taxes from oil
infrastructure. These benefits are delivered in a paternalistic way and
belong mostly to the investment principle of benefit-sharing.
TheNSBsubsidizeshospitalsandpolice, buildshouses,
operatesfirestationsandhelicopters, andfunds schools. For example, in
2019, assessed properties of the NSB constituted \$21.8 billion, from
which oil and gas taxable properties constitute \$20.3 billion \[81\].
The NSB continues to be a major employer, health care, and
infrastructure provider. For example, in 2019, NSB collected in tax
approximately \$379 million, coming mostly from oil property tax and
spent \$77.8 million for eight villages infrastructure, airports,
landfills, community facilities, natural gas infrastructure, road
maintenance and equipment, for wages around \$80.3 million, for
education around \$49 million and for wildlife management \$5.7 million,
for Inupiat heritage, language and culture 5.5 million. Overall public
works constituted approximately 82 million \[81\]. This represents a big
sum of money taking into account that overall population in NSB is only
20,953; around 10,420 of the population are village residents, of which
4000 are Inupiat, and another 10,533 are oil workers \[82\]. Therefore,
one can acknowledge that there is a significant amount of money that can
be distributed to communities. All
theinterviewedcitizensinthevillagesacknowledgethattheNSBformationanditsinstitutional
set up was extremely important for the wellbeing of the Inupiat people.
However, [they feel that they do not get enough.]{.underline} The North
Slope Borough, despite being run by natives, in the view of natives,
does not distribute the oil tax money according to the villagers' needs
\[83,84\]. However, villagers can ask and complain about the decisions,
on large construction projects, the capital investment programs that the
NSB assembly and various powerful actors made. Money is supposed to be
distributed to eight NSBvillages according to their needs and requests.
However, [citizens feel that Utqiagvik accumulates most of the
resources, while villages receive much less, decisions are made
top--down, mostly by ruling elites]{.underline} \[85\]. NSB is involved
in large construction projects, however, little money is designated in
the budget for repairing existing infrastructure, which is decaying
\[86\]. As we can see, this creates a situation when residents express
high and often unrealistic expectations of the NSB authorities.
Villagers perceive benefits as misdirected and limited. NSB holds public
meetings in the villages, but residents feel that their voices are often
not heard. Therefore, in mandated arrangements, partly due to
paternalism and according to perceptions of remote villagers, there are
pitfalls in both procedural and distributional equities, despite
significantly allocated money. Sustainability 2020, 12, 5432 16 of 31
5.1.2. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Another example of the
paternalistic mode of benefit-sharing is BLM policy. As it was explained
above,
BLMwithConocoPhillipsnegotiatedtheRegionalMitigationStrategyin2015asacompensation
for adverse impacts of oil and gas extraction at the newly opened GMT-1
and 8 mln dollars were allocated \[87\]. This strategy was supposed to
become a new policy tool using the compensatory principle as a template
for further agreements for new extractive projects in the Reserve
\[88\]. After negotiations concluded, it would become a mandated
mechanism in case the Trump administration did not freeze its
implementation. As we will explain later, RMS was set up as a
participatory, however the paternalistic mode. BLMorganized multiple
consultations, held both outside and within the region, and invited a
variety of stakeholders. This approach indicates that the process was
highly participatory. However, our informants felt that the design of
the process was top--down and authoritarian. [BLM took 1 million dollars
to organize the RMS process, Nuiqsut citizens felt that this was wrong;
in their opinion, all money needed to go to the most a ected
communities.]{.underline} They felt that BLM spent money on studies to
measure impacts that will attract more planes and helicopters with
scientists, which will scare caribou and e ect indigenous hunting
\[89\]. The representative of ASRC argued that the BLM had a
predetermined agenda; during the consultation processes, they
reinterpreted local voices towards their own interests and agendas
\[90\]. The fact that BLM invited many environmental NGOs to the RMS
workshopupsettherepresentative and highlighted this as a pitfall in
procedural equity. He argued that [NGOrepresentatives were all over
during breakout sessions and disturbed the local decision-making process
by diluting local voices]{.underline}: ["\[T\]his was one sided deal, I
was frustrated, our voices were diluted]{.underline} " \[90\] ASRC was
intended to file a lawsuit against the government in case the
consultation period was not extended and time given to indigenous
organizations to comment on the proposed policy. The
[representative]{.underline} of ConocoPhillips [also criticized the
process, arguing that locally formed NPR-A working groups could develop
the RMS mitigation strategy and that outside stakeholders were not
helpful for the overall process]{.underline} \[91\]. ASRC
representatives felt that the RMS process brings division to indigenous
governance organizations instead of facilitating unity \[90\]. Local
people felt that BLM hired a consultant that could not understand the
natives, was speaking to them with "western" language and was trying to
force natives to put a monetary value on their subsistence \[92\].
During the RMS process, tensions emerge between the city
administrations, tribal governments, village and native corporations
around the distribution of funds, as these three entities have di erent
interests. Tribal governments do not benefit from oil extraction
directly and tend to be more environmentally oriented. They argued that
it is impossible to evaluate the damage to native subsistence and
culture. They were not in favor of future oil development despite
compensatory money. The city government was neutral, while regional and
village native corporations were pro responsible development of oil and
gas resources: "[We need to maximize benefits and participation. New
development is not new for us\... we know how to proceed."]{.underline}
\[90\] When the new federal administration froze an RMS mitigation
strategy, native stakeholders reassessed its value. Several tribal
members in Nuiqsut felt that the RMS is necessary as there should be
more mitigation money because the irreversible impacts of oil
development are high. On the contrary, a representative of ASRC argued
that local people need opportunities, hard work, and jobs that would
overcome dependence on governmental welfare, all of which RMS would
promote. Therefore, he was satisfied with freezing the RMS strategy,
hoping that paternalism between governments and natives is possible to
overcome. In terms of distributive equity as a result of GMT-1
compensatory money, as muchassevenmillion dollars went to the community
of Nuiqsut, which was the community most a ected by development. The
people agreed upon how the money would be spent.

### Alaska Econ Cooked\-\--2AC

#### Current dividends are fried

James **Brooks**, 2-7-20**23**, James Brooks is a longtime Alaska
reporter, having previously worked at the Anchorage Daily News, Juneau
Empire, Kodiak Mirror and Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. A graduate of
Virginia Tech, Alaska House votes to cut proposed dividend, but huge
deficit remains unresolved, Alaska Beacon,
https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/04/11/alaska-house-votes-to-cut-proposed-dividend-but-huge-deficit-remains-unresolved/,
accessed 7-22-2025, Eric Cardman

The [Alaska House of Representatives voted to cut its proposed 2025
Permanent Fund dividend by almost **two-thirds**]{.underline} on Friday
as the House's contentious budget process lurched another step forward.
The reduction, which had stymied the House Finance Committee for more
than a week, drops the proposed dividend [from roughly \$3,900 per
recipient to about \$1,400]{.underline}. Assuming Gov. Mike Dunleavy's
proposed capital budget, the change cuts the proposed [budget deficit
from \$1.9 billion to less than \$400 million for the fiscal year that
begins in July. Lawmakers also face an almost \$200 million deficit in
the budget that ends June 30.]{.underline} The House is set to resume
debating the state's fiscal year 2026 operating budget on Monday.
Members of the House's Republican minority caucus said they were caught
off guard by Friday's vote. Several Republicans said they had been told
by the leaders of the House's Democratic-independent-Republican majority
caucus that there would be no budget action on Friday, and three
minority Republican lawmakers were absent as a result. Amendments pass
the House if approved by a majority of lawmakers present on the floor,
and the amendment to reduce the proposed dividend passed 20-17, with
Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, joining 16 minority Republicans in opposition.
"I am ashamed at the process, and I am ashamed at what is happening
today," said House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage. "What is
happening today on amendment No. 1 is, in my mind, now considered the
poster child of disingenuous relations," she said. Rep. Frank
Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks, attempted to adjourn the House until Monday in
order to allow time for the missing Republicans to return, but that
proposal was voted down. Friday's vote capped a vexing week for members
of the House majority, who sought to reduce the Permanent Fund dividend
but lacked the votes to do so because of the opposition of Foster and
Rep. Nellie Jimmie, D-Toksook Bay. In previous years, legislators have
used the Permanent Fund dividend as a budget-balancing tool, reducing
the amount in years with low revenue and raising it in years with more
revenue, as after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Normally, the House
Finance Committee starts its budget debates with a low proposed
dividend, and lawmakers negotiate to raise that figure. This year, Rep.
Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and the co-chair of the finance committee,
started with a larger figure, first proposed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy in
December. Josephson, speaking to the Juneau Empire, called that decision
a mistake. Cutting the Permanent Fund dividend functions like a
regressive tax --- it disproportionately affects low-income Alaskans,
and two of the finance committee's members are rural Democrats who
represent the two lowest-income House districts in the state. In
committee, Foster said he could not vote to reduce the dividend. He and
Jimmie joined five Republican members of the committee in voting against
a budget-balancing amendment proposed by Josephson that would have set
the dividend at \$1,000. Late Thursday, in an unusual hearing, the
committee again tried and again failed to cut the dividend before
sending the budget to the floor. The debate was cut short as several
members of the committee rushed away to present a legislative citation
to the Alaska Folk Fest, occurring a few blocks from the Capitol. On
Friday, Jimmie gave an impassioned speech, saying that the large
dividend proposed by Dunleavy and the finance committee was never
realistic and is a heartbreaking mirage for her constituents, who rely
on the dividend for food and basic essentials. "I'm going to tell you
the truth," she said on the House floor, addressing constituents
watching the debate on TV. "From the very first day that we walked into
this building, there was never enough money for a full PFD, not without
cutting the things that keep us alive: schools, public safety, health
care." The dividend means dignity, means keeping people out of poverty,
she said. "It hurts me to see that dividend, something that means
heating oil in the winters, diapers for our babies, food on the table,
being dangled like a bait, like a prize on a string," she said. Jimmie
said she would continue to advocate for a large dividend but "could not
lie to my people to get applause," and voted in favor of the cut. No
lawmaker has proposed tax increases large enough to pay for the larger
Permanent Fund dividend, and legislators say they are unwilling to break
a soft cap on spending from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which leaves the
Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state's principal savings account, as
the only means to cover the deficit. That would require votes from 30 of
the 40 members of the House and 15 of the 20 members of the Senate, plus
the assent of the governor. The CBR held \$2.83 billion as of Feb. 28
and the draft budget with the larger dividend would have consumed more
than two-thirds of it. "So this is where we are, ladies and gentlemen,"
Josephson said on Friday. "This is where we are when we're the only
state that is striving mightily to pay money to every citizen that is
eligible, and tax no one in the state. Why are we surprised?"

### Fed Key\-\--2AC

#### Trump is substantially increasing investment into Arctic drilling absent the plan -- federal regulations are key for federal projects.

[The Trump administration]{.underline} formally announced Thursday that
it [plan]{.underline}ned [to expand drilling in the Arctic]{.underline},
including in the contentious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 

The Interior Department said that it would take steps toward [opening up
the entire 1.56 million-acre Coastal Plain of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. ]{.underline}

In addition, the department said that it would seek to [open up 82
percent of the separate National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska's Western
Arctic.]{.underline} The decision comes after the Biden administration
limited drilling there [to less than
half](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4604023-biden-administration-bars-drilling-on-millions-of-acres-in-alaska/) of
the 23 million-acre reserve. 

The Trump administration also indicated it would revoke a Biden-era
decision that [blocked an Alaska mining
road](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4744401-biden-administration-blocks-mining-road-alaska/) and
that it would [take steps to bolster a [gas pipeline
project](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/business/trump-tariffs-alaska-lng-japan.html).]{.underline}

["It's time for the U.S. to embrace Alaska's abundant and largely

Nation,]{.underline} including Alaskans[," said]{.underline} Interior
[Secretary [Doug
Burgum ](https://thehill.com/people/doug-burgum/)]{.underline}in a

"For far too long, the federal government has created too many barriers
to capitalizing on the state's energy potential. Interior is committed
to recognizing the central role the State of Alaska plays in meeting our
nation's energy needs, while providing tremendous economic opportunity
for Alaskans," he said.  

The moves are not necessarily a surprise. [President Trump on his first
day in office [signed an executive
order](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5097241-trump-executive-orders-oil-drilling-climate-electric-vehicles/) calling

Indigenous Education and Traditional Knowledge

When trying to understand and incorporate indigenous knowledge, it helps
to have an awareness of their epistemology. The first consideration
explained in this section is Indigenous education, i.e. ways of knowing,
presented through the stories and explanations of indigenous
participants. The second consideration, traditional knowledge, will be
presented through native and non-native perspectives. [They explain the
distinguishing features of land-based knowledge and the **value of
incorporating indigenous expertise**. My research leads me to believe
that western corporations need to think outside the box and look through
the broad view of indigenous education to sustainably co-develop the
Arctic. Kawagley explains that by \"trying to understand the parts to
understand the whole\" (categorization), \"\[[western]{.mark}\]
[assumptions]{.mark} (proposition) [and expectations]{.mark} (syllogism)
[muddle]{.mark} **their** [efforts to see things as they really
are]{.mark}\"(Kawagley, 1999 p.84). Norma Shorty (Interview 2021) also
describes the \"idea of a [Western methodology]{.mark}...\[[as]{.mark}\]
squares and blocks\...[building blocks to knowledge
scaffolding]{.mark}\". On the other hand, they describe \"[indigenous
ways of knowing]{.mark}\" [as \"circular\"]{.mark} it-\"deals with the
**whole physical, intellectual, emotional, and spiritual of inner and
outer ecologies**\"(Kawagley, 1999 and Interview Shorty, 2021). This
circularity reflects both the connection of the knowledge to
environmental cycles but also human life cycles.]{.underline}

Creating a sustainable future requires both of these cycles to be in
harmony and indigenous people understand this better than outsiders
because they know the land. [Shorty (Interview 2021) notes it is
important \"to understand that indigenous knowledge is place based\" and
\"the stories and histories\...inform us how we can sustain our way of
life forever\".]{.underline} However, Glenn (Interview 2021) makes the
point that \"it\'s a use it or lose it culture\" and Schutt (Interview
2021) shared his concerns that too many youths were moving away from the
land. The ongoing migration from rural Alaska is detrimental to Arctic
knowledge since those growing up outside their lands lose the knowledge
from experience and the language skills to listen and learn from the
elders. To avoid further insertion of western epistemology, the
protection of indigenous culture \"belongs \[to\] the communities
\[but\] can be supported by these development players\" (Interview
Glenn, 2021).

Learning by observation, stories, and experience for thousands of years
has equip the indigenous communities of the Arctic with the knowledge to
innovate for, adapt to, and overcome challenges posed by their
environment. [Companies should consider how indigenous knowledge of the
land will affect their expectations for developers.]{.underline} Slaiby
(Interview 2021), former VP of Shell Alaska, explained that [\"what
[traditional knowledge observes]{.mark}\...[science cannot argue with
the phenomenon they\'ve been looking at for 12,000 years]{.mark}, they
pretty much got \[outsiders\] beat.\" Even if the [indigenous
experts]{.mark} cannot always explain using scientific language,
**they** [understand their environment]{.mark}. There are positive
implications for western knowledge in the Arctic because \"it can
actually be very helpful in explaining some of the phenomenon\"
(Interview Slaiby, 2021). Arctic scientific exploration has only
scratched the tip of the iceberg. If outsiders \"do it
respectfully\...and use \[indigenous knowledge\] as a kind of mutual
expertise\...then \[they\] start to learn the lessons that have been
hard fought and paid for already in this traditional knowledge\"
(Interview Glenn, 2021).]{.underline} Much of this knowledge is embedded
in the language, making language conservation important for both
indigenous cultures and their partners. TK can assist with the areas of
working on and with sea ice and the protection of wildlife.

To demonstrate how [[\"indigenous people wouldn\'t be consulted to the
detriment of both parties\"]{.underline}]{.mark}, Reiss (Interview 2021)
told me his experience in a Navy War Room simulation. When developing a
response plan to an oil spill in the Arctic, [there was no discussion
about ice until finally, Reiss himself mentioned, \"the ice comes in
October\"; an important consideration he picked up when working with
Edward Itta (Interview Reiss, 2021). Even in the 2010s, the **US Navy
forgot the existence of Alaska Natives as a necessary perspective for
Arctic planning**. Reiss (Interview 2021) explains that \"it never was
that...\[outsiders\] were looking down on locals, it was that they were
looking past locals\...they just didn\'t realize what they didn\'t know
\[and\] how they could maximize their own interests by cooperating with
locals\".]{.underline} There is a real danger for humans, for industry,
and for wildlife of missing important considerations, like understanding
sea ice, that are always on the minds of people who have lived in the
Arctic for millennia. Where outsiders see a \"beautiful painting of a
guy standing on an ice flow\", Edward Itta, former Mayor of the North
Slope Borough, sees \"a guy stranded on the ice flow because he didn\'t
pay attention\" (Itta cited in Interview Reiss, 2021).

[Including indigenous people in planning reduces the risk that outsiders
will miss an important consideration of TK. Even Slaiby, who \"drilled a
lot of wells\...in all kinds of areas\...harsh and benign environments\"
recognized that the \"\[DOI\] regulations aren\'t going to work \[in the
Arctic\]\"]{.underline} (Interview, 2021). Correspondingly, Edward Itta
said, \"the stuff you\'re doing won\'t work here\", so Slaiby worked
with Itta to \"recreate \[plans\] and \[put\] a program together that\'s
going to work for \[Alaska Natives and the Arctic\]\" (Interview 2021).
[Even when the federal government carries out **[environmental impact
assessments]{.mark}** before leasing, their **outside scientists have
sometimes** [fail]{.mark}**ed** [to identify risks that indigenous
people always consider]{.mark}. Itta \"knew that his traditional
knowledge was critically important to his success in making sure the
standards that apply for offshore drilling were strong\" (Interview
Mack, 2021).]{.underline} In Alaska Wilderness League v. Kempthorne the
9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that [the [federal assessors "failed
to]{.mark} take a 'hard [look']{.mark} [at]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark}
Shell\'s project would have [on]{.mark} the [Inupiat\'s subsistence uses
of bowhead whales]{.mark}"]{.underline}(Nelson, 2008, Sec II (B)(2)).
[The opinion of the case cites that **[the]{.mark} ["\[environmental
assessment\] itself admits]{.mark}** that 'it is [unknown]{.mark} what
the increased level of [effect]{.mark}" Shell's proposed exploration
would create (Nelson, 2008).22 The 'petitioners', who "contend that
\[some\] assumption is erroneous" repeatedly are the opinions of the
whaling captains that Itta submitted because "there was a pretty long

In most countries, [impact assessment]{.underline} serves as the main
instrument for predicting and mitigating the impacts of natural resource
exploitation \[73\]. However, historically, its implementation
[has]{.underline} often [been **poorly aligned** with the rights of
Indigenous peoples]{.underline} to self-determination **[despite the
requirement for]{.underline}** the **[consent]{.underline}** of
Indigenous communities [before initiating extractive
activities]{.underline} on their lands or where their rights are
impacted \[74\]. Several studies present how [impact assessments
**neglect Indigenous worldviews and practices**]{.underline} \[75\].
Assessments are mainly [based on **western international standards**,
such as recognized lists of threatened species based on rarity or
vulnerability]{.underline} \[44\]. [Cultural heritage protection efforts
relate]{.underline} mainly [to tangible sites]{.underline} such as
archaeological sites including artefacts, e.g., stone tools, but the
site is mostly treated separately from the cultural landscape that
supports them \[76\]. [Culture is usually treated as a]{.underline}
'[good]{.underline}' (i.e., a commodity), [rather than]{.underline} as
[an activity]{.underline} conducted by people who have rights to its
practice \[77\]. "This focus is a core misunderstanding of cultural
heritage management, whereby many intangible or ethnographic sites that
provide multiple benefits to Indigenous people, and that are rarely
visible to non-Indigenous people or those who do not hold customary
knowledge, are typically not recognized \[...\] in cultural heritage or
biodiversity impact assessments" (\[44\], p.3).

The United States' National Environmental Policy Act
([NEPA]{.underline}), for example, [established procedures
for]{.underline} federal agencies to prepare Environmental Impact
Statements ([EISs]{.underline}) for major federal actions that may
impact the environment. [Indigenous people]{.underline} "[are not
understood to be parts of, and deeply knowledgeable about, the
ecosystems]{.underline} that [NEPA is designed to protect]{.underline}"
(\[78\], p.43). Instead, Indigenous people are understood to be only
concerned with cultural 'goods', e.g., archaeological sites. Impacts on
wildlife and plants are assessed by biologists, impacts on water by
hydrologists, and impacts on ecosystems by ecologists \[78[\]. When
Indigenous communities try to contribute]{.underline} to their topics
"-- [using]{.underline} such [bureaucratic concepts]{.underline} as
'sacred sites', 'cultural landscapes', and 'traditional cultural
properties'-- [they find that **they have only made more work** for the
anthropologists and archaeologists, while they themselves **become the
objects of social scientific study**]{.underline}" (\[78\], pp.43--44)

The examples make clear that [impact assessments]{.underline} usually
[**don't consider who holds the relevant knowledge** to predict
impacts]{.underline} \[79\]. [This results in **insufficient community
involvement**, which affects]{.underline} appropriate activities like
[rehabilitation and compensation]{.underline} \[44\]. As an element of
environmental impact assessment, [social impact assessment]{.underline}
emerged throughout many western countries during the late 1960s.
However, Lawrence and Larsen \[74\] show how it [fails to acknowledge
Indigenous rights and how industrial developments are generally taken as
a priori. The assessment]{.underline} is mainly used to balance and
manage the positives and negatives of (an inevitable) development but
[does not include the right of affected Indigenous communities to
withhold their consent]{.underline}.

Coupled with the consistent portrayal of front-line damage is also an
[invocation of Indigenous rights as a potential strategic avenue to curb
industrial development]{.underline} -- and this can be found throughout
the climate justice movement where the language of protecting 'the
commons' reigns. Naomi Klein's This Changes Everything: Capitalism VS
the Climate [contains numerous references to the]{.underline} potential
[utility of Indigenous legal rights **as way to safeguard**]{.underline}
what she calls the 'unexploded carbon bombs that lie beneath the lands
and waters to which Indigenous peoples have legitimate legal claims'. On
this point, Klein writes:

> No one has more legal power to halt the reckless expansion of the tar
> sands than the First Nations living downstream whose treaty protected
> hunting, fighting, and trapping grounds have already been fouled, just
> as no on has more legal power to halt the rush to drill under the
> Arctic's melting ice than the Inuit, Sami, and other northern
> Indigenous tribes whose livelihoods would be jeopardized by an
> offshore oil spill. (2014, p. 375)

While I certainly see merit in Klein's call to mobilize alongside
front-line Indigenous communities to halt extraction and industrial
development, [I am suspect of the instrumental framing of]{.underline}
'[Indigenous rights]{.underline}' **[as a way to protect all of
us]{.underline}** against the whims of settler colonial state agents --
or who she refers to as politicians -- [when settler
publics]{.underline} in both the USA and Canada [have done little to
address the ongoing dispossession and elimination of Indigenous peoples,
a politics of elimination that made it possible for this]{.underline}
kind of [development to unfold in the first place]{.underline} I might
add. Moreover, this kind of [strategic instrumentalism does not appear
to be linked to the broader goals of Indigenous resurgence or
decolonization that would require a **deliberate undoing** of the
settler state. Such an **omission could**]{.underline} potentially
[**open the door to an abdication of political responsibility**. Even
the language of]{.underline} '[rights]{.underline}' as a choice of
political vernacular and framing here **[reinscribes settler state power
as the ultimate authority]{.underline}** since 'rights' are mediated or
granted by the settler state itself.5

**[Should mining]{.underline}** of cobalt or copper **[occur on
Indigenous peoples' lands]{.underline}** in order to hasten the
industrial transition to renewable energy? The question **[is not the
right question]{.underline}**, and perhaps **[it is not best to
understand this issue through any question]{.underline}**. A better
pathway may be as follows.

[Indigenous peoples have their own infrastructure
traditions]{.underline}, which have been [subject to rampant
environmental injustice. Indigenous infrastructure has been
**overthrown**]{.underline} by American settler infrastructure. The U.S.
government and American [settlers]{.underline} have [actively undermined
Indigenous peoples' capacity to make decisions about
infrastructure]{.underline} today and to implement infrastructure plans
[through self-governance]{.underline}. The various government,
corporate, and other architects of U.S. infrastructure today did not
design or organize the infrastructure systems for Indigenous peoples to
exercise self-determination, consent, and self-governance.

[The transition]{.underline} to wind and solar energy and electric
vehicles [is a matter of decisions that the public and private sectors
will make]{.underline} about how to change the design and organization
of American infrastructure and its relationships to infrastructure
throughout the world. Through organizations such as the National
Congress of American Indians or the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest
Indians, [Indigenous peoples]{.underline} in the continental U.S. [have
made clear]{.underline} that [**they want to be at the forefront** of
efforts to transition]{.underline} to renewable energy and to move away
from the burning of fossil fuels. Indigenous leaders, both elected
officials and Tribal staff, are knowledgeable about infrastructure and
supply chains. They have to govern, create investments for, and foster
economic security for the Tribes they work for and represent.

The vision for renewable energy today that Indigenous peoples have
combined their traditions, knowledge, culture, respect for future
generations, and understanding of their current infrastructure situation
today. It is visionary and practical knowledge, knowledge of exactly
what needs to be put in motion to lead to a renewable energy transition.
But [Indigenous visions and knowledge]{.underline}, understood in this
way, [**are not being portrayed** when some people settle
on]{.underline} simply [asking]{.underline} the question of [whether the
needed mining will affect]{.underline} sacred or culturally significant
places on [Indigenous peoples' land]{.underline}.

[The better pathway forward is one in which Indigenous communities
and]{.underline} Indigenous [leaders are **thoroughly capable** of being
real members of the private and public sector groups that make and
influence decisions about]{.underline} American
[infrastructure]{.underline} -- that is, Indigenous self-determination,
consent, and self-governance are fully part of the decisions that will
be made.

In 2021--22, various news headlines shared some striking announcements
about the relationship between Tribal nations and the U.S. The White
House and Congress promised unprecedented investments into Tribal
infrastructure. The areas of infrastructure investment range from water
sanitation to orphan well clean up to climate change resilience to
renewable energy. The new investments are coming after decades of re-
ports that cited the ways in which the U.S. deprived Tribal nations of
infrastructure.

Given the new resources available at this possibly temporary moment in
time, [it is more important to]{.underline} begin to [appreciate the
challenges]{.underline} that [Indigenous peoples are facing when it
comes to repairing]{.underline} the [infrastructure]{.underline}
situation. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill includes 13 billion
for infrastructure projects in Tribal nations, including in sanitation
facilities, transportation, water rights, broadband, clean water and
drinking water, bridges, dams, climate adaptation and relocation, and
orphaned wells, sparking some to call it a "once-in-a-generation"
investment and "gold rush for Tribal energy projects." These were the
largest investments ever. But the investments will not be taken
advantage of if Indigenous peoples are not shaping how the resources and
technologies in the investments are designed to be fully harnessed by
communities, Tribal governments, and Indigenous organizations and
businesses. [The issue of mining for the raw materials needed for
renewable energy is part of a much larger set of infrastructure topics.
**It is not an isolated or discreet issue that can be treated
separately**]{.underline}.

Indigenous environmental justice cannot be reckoned with on an issue-
by-issue basis. Raw materials' mining for renewables, should it be
proposed on Indigenous lands, is connected to much longer histories of
Indigenous exclusion from infrastructure, infrastructure injustice, and
the deliberate undermining of Indigenous institutions of self-governance
by American settlers. [Advocates]{.underline} of renewable energy
[should ask]{.underline} the question of [whether Indigenous peoples
have had the capacity to exercise self- determination, **and are in the
position to consent to, the decisions that went into this**]{.underline}
whole **[topic]{.underline}** of how renewable energy and mining are
related in the first place.

[If Indigenous peoples continue to not be at key decision-making
tables]{.underline}, then [they will continue]{.underline} to have [to
be **passive actors** resisting the plans devised by]{.underline}
American [settlers]{.underline} and other non-Indigenous parties [to
mitigate and manage crises that Indigenous peoples by and large did not
cause]{.underline}, climate change being one example. **[There is
no]{.underline}** "**[tough luck]{.underline}**" **[argument that is
acceptable to make when discussing]{.underline}** the **[industrial
realities]{.underline}** of developing renewable energy that will make a
difference. Scientists, [policy-makers,]{.underline} and others, [if
they are serious about mitigating climate change, will
recognize]{.underline} that [strengthening Indigenous]{.underline}
peoples' [self-determination and consent is the **fastest route**. For
Indigenous peoples will have the empowerment to plan their economies,
including]{.underline} the ending of all problematic forms of economic
and energy [dependence on fossil fuels]{.underline} in their
territories, [and be able to devise collaborative strategies with others
about how to develop renewable energy responsibly]{.underline}.

#### Self-determination extends to [all]{.underline} energy decisions, not just those settlers think are good.

[There is a misunderstanding that]{.underline} the topic of [Indigenous
environmental justice is **confined** to the idea of Indigenous peoples
as populations who]{.underline} commonly [stand to be harmed by
industrial projects promulgated by]{.underline} public and private
sector [organizations and that serve the settler
population]{.underline}. There is certainly more to the topic.
[Indigenous environmental justice is]{.underline} importantly [about the
**continued exclusion** of Indigenous peoples from]{.underline} having
any [leadership roles within]{.underline} the [development]{.underline}
of infrastructure in the U.S. -- including energy infrastructure.
[Leadership means]{.underline} at least three powers: Indigenous
peoples' [**self-determination, consent, and self-governance**
in]{.underline} determining [how]{.underline} their communities and all
[communities]{.underline} in North America [would be powered, fueled,
and energized]{.underline}.

[Indigenous peoples **have not been at the table since the
beginning**]{.underline} of the U.S. in making decisions about what
forms of energy would be established for the U.S. economy
(self-determination). Indigenous communities have not had the
opportunity to refuse to be saddled by the harms and risks of mining,
drilling, and other energy and industrial infrastructure (consent). And
[Indigenous peoples]{.underline}\\ [own or manage very
little]{.underline} of the [energy infrastructure]{.underline} that
operates [on their lands or that they depend on]{.underline}
(self-governance). Given that Indigenous peoples have a track record of
environmental advocacy going back to the earliest phases of the U.S., it
is perhaps the case that Indigenous self-determination, consent, and
self-governance would have curbed U.S. industrial growth from being
carried out as irresponsibly as it has been.

Indigenous self-determination, consent, and self-governance are
enshrined in recent White House policy on Indigenous peoples and growing
international norms tied to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The Biden-Harris plan for Tribal Nations
includes plans to "strengthen the Nation-to-Nation relationship,"
"restore tribal lands, address climate change, and safeguard natural and
cultural resources," and "expand economic opportunity and community
development in Native communities."21 The administration's 2021
"Memorandum on Tribal Consultation and Strengthening Nation-to-Nation
Relationships" states:

> It is a priority of my Administration to make respect for Tribal
> sovereignty and self-governance, commitment to fulfilling Federal
> trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, and regular,
> meaningful, and robust consultation with Tribal Nations cornerstones
> of Federal Indian policy. The United States has made solemn promises
> to Tribal Nations for more than two centuries. Honoring those
> commitments is particularly vital now, as our Nation faces crises
> related to health, the economy, racial justice, and climate
> change---all of which disproportionately harm Native Americans.
> History demonstrates that we best serve Native American people when
> Tribal governments are empowered to lead their communities, and when
> Federal officials speak with and listen to Tribal leaders in
> formulating Federal policy that affects Tribal Nations.22

[Regarding climate change, Indigenous self-determination,
in]{.underline} terms of [political sovereignty, and self-governance are
articulated as solutions]{.underline}.

UNDRIP enshrines that Indigenous peoples have the right to
self-determination to "freely determine their political status and
freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development" (article
3). UNDRIP de- scribes that "States shall consult and cooperate in good
faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own
representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and
informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or
administrative measures that may affect them" (article 19). [Indigenous
self-governance is **described in terms of Indigenous institutions and
capacities**]{.underline}: "Indigenous peoples have the right to
maintain and develop their political, economic and social systems or
institutions, to be secure in the enjoyment of their own means of
subsistence and development, and to engage freely in all their
traditional and other economic activities (Article 20.1); Indigenous
peoples deprived of their means of subsistence and development are
entitled to just and fair redress (Article 20.2)."

Numerous [Indigenous peoples approach mining in terms of their rights to
self-determination, consent, and self-governance. Historically, colonial
mining industries and other large infrastructure projects **squashed the
possibility** that Indigenous peoples would **emerge as leaders** in
infrastructure development]{.underline}. Second, over time, [Indigenous
peoples' institutions for making decisions about]{.underline} large
[infrastructure have been]{.underline} largely [curtailed, making it
impossible]{.underline} for Indigenous peoples [to take on their own
energy projects as quickly]{.underline} as they need to. [The history of
American settlement, industrial infrastructure, and Indigenous peoples
is critical to being able to understand this moment when decisions are
being made about the energy future of the U.S., and where many people
are pressing for a rapid transition]{.underline} to renewable energy.

**Ma**, **25** \[John, February 2025, State Regs Today, "Alaska mining
regulations,"
https://www.stateregstoday.com/state/alaska-mining-regulations, accessed
7-18 DG\]

[**Permits** **required** for mining activities in Alaska include a
**state mining permit**, a **federal mining permit** from the Bureau of
Land Management, and permits for specific activities such as water use
or waste disposal. Additionally, mining companies are required to obtain
various environmental permits to ensure compliance with regulations and
potential impacts on natural resources.]{.underline}

5\. Can individuals or small businesses obtain mining permits in Alaska,
or is it mainly reserved for large corporations?

Individuals or small businesses have the opportunity to obtain mining
permits in Alaska, but it depends on the type of mining and the specific
location they are interested in. There are certain regulations and
requirements that must be met, regardless of the size of the operation.
However, larger corporations may have an advantage due to their
resources and experience in navigating the permitting process.

6\. Are there any restrictions on where mining activities can take place
in Alaska?

[Yes, there are restrictions on where mining activities can take place
in Alaska. The **state has specific regulations and permits that must be
obtained before any mining can occur,** and **certain areas may be
off-limits for environmental or cultural preservation purposes**.
Additionally, the **federal government also has jurisdiction** over some
lands in Alaska **and may have their own regulations regarding mining
activities.**]{.underline}

7\. Has there been any recent updates or changes to Alaska's mining
regulations?

Yes, there have been recent updates and changes to Alaska's mining
regulations. In 2019, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
released a new five-year state mining plan which includes revisions to
regulations related to bonding requirements, environmental permits,
exploration rights, and land use restrictions. Additionally, in January
2020, the DNR proposed a series of amendments to existing regulations in
order to streamline the permitting process for small-scale mining
operations. These changes are aimed at balancing conservation and
economic development in the state's mining industry.

8\. How does the state government enforce compliance with mining
regulations in Alaska?

The state government enforces compliance with mining regulations in
Alaska through various methods such as inspections, audits, and
enforcement actions. This may involve conducting regular on-site
inspections to ensure that mining companies are following all applicable
rules and regulations, reviewing reports and documents submitted by
mining operators, and issuing warnings or penalties for any violations
found. In addition, the state may also work closely with federal
agencies to coordinate enforcement efforts and monitor overall
compliance with mining laws in the state.

9\. Are there any penalties or consequences for violating Alaska's
mining regulations?

Yes, there are penalties and consequences for violating Alaska's mining
regulations. These penalties can include fines, revocation of permits or
licenses, and even criminal charges in some cases. Additionally,
violators may be required to restore any damage caused to the
environment or pay for any cleanup costs associated with their mining
activities. The severity of the penalties will depend on the specific
violation and its impact on the environment and public safety.

10\. What steps are taken to ensure responsible and sustainable mining
practices in Alaska?

1\. Environmental Impact Assessments: Before mining projects can begin,
companies are required to conduct thorough environmental impact
assessments to identify potential risks and impacts on the local
ecosystems and communities.

2\. Laws and Regulations: Alaska has strict laws and regulations in
place regarding mining activities, including the Clean Water Act, the
National Environmental Policy Act, and the Alaska Land Act. These laws
ensure that mining companies operate responsibly and mitigate any
negative impacts on the environment.

3\. Permitting Process[: Mining companies must obtain various permits
from state and federal agencies before they can start operations in
Alaska. These permits require them to adhere to certain standards and
guidelines for responsible mining practices.]{.underline}

3.4 Discussion and Conclusion

If the impacts (both positive and negative) of industrial infrastructure
on the wellbeing of communities that are in the vicinity of development
is proportional to the amount of infrastructure that exists on the
ground and in the sea, then future impacts in the US Arctic could be
considerable in a maximum development scenario. However, a minimum
development scenario - which could plausibly include no additional
construction of industrial infrastructure - should also be considered
and would raise a different set of questions. Namely questions about
decommissioning the infrastructure that has already been build and
rehabilitating affected landand seascapes (see e.g., Jorgenson & Joyce,
1994). [[If industrial actors]{.mark} were to [wind down]{.mark} their
operations, [significant clean up expenses]{.mark} could be [transferred
to]{.mark} affected [communities]{.mark} if the associated corporations
do not fulfill their reclamation responsibilities]{.underline} (Marion,
Massicotte, & Duhn, 2014). [But what determines whether [future
impacts]{.mark} manifest [as]{.mark} [benefits or harms]{.mark} to
communities? The [key]{.mark} lies [in]{.mark}
**[governance]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Analyzing the role of governance in mitigating the relationship between
industrial activity and community wellbeing in the Arctic is an emerging
theme in academic research. [Nuttall (2010), provides an
ethnography-based analysis of how 'dreams' of [oil]{.mark} and gas
wealth have [shaped relations between Indigenous people and federal
government]{.mark}s in Canada and the US, highlighting both benefits and
drawbacks of current relations but [emphasiz]{.mark}ing the **[need for
increased representation of Indigenous interests]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Similarly, an edited volume out of [Fennoscandia asks whether pan-arctic
oil and gas development has moved beyond sustainability (Mikkelsen &
Langhelle, 2008). The authors' answer is that it depends on how one
defines sustainability. The resources being extracted are non-renewable,
they point out, but the [revenue from development]{.mark} **could be**
[invested in economic diversification]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **economic**
[growth]{.mark} **that** [is sustainable]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Hovelsrud, Poppel, Van Oort, and Reist (2011) focus on rural arctic
communities and their adaptive capacities to a variety of changes,
including increased industrial activity, concluding that
[governance]{.mark} will [determine]{.mark} [whether communities
prosper]{.mark} or wither in the future.]{.underline}

[With regard to the US Arctic specifically, Haley et al. (2011) argue
that good [governance of oil and gas production in Alaska]{.mark}'s
offshore environment includes [strengthen]{.mark}ing the institutions
that assure [community-based involvement in decision
making]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [Sherval (2013) suggests that
Alaska's oil and gas resources could [contribute]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
nation's energy independence, while enhancing local [energy security for
Alaskan communities]{.mark} as well.]{.underline} Clearly, the nexus of
natural resources, Indigenous people, and governance in the Arctic is a
crucial area of research and action. This article intends to contribute
to the emerging body of literature that critically examines the
relationship between community wellbeing and industrial activity in the
Arctic by a) demonstrating a methodology that is forward looking in its

[[What]{.mark} would [governance]{.mark} [that]{.mark} maximizes the
[benefits]{.mark} of industrial activities for [communities]{.mark}
[look like?]{.mark} This article suggest that [two]{.mark} main
[factors]{.mark} play a critical role in governance: [a)]{.mark} power
(i.e., the [ability to control processes of development]{.mark}) and
[b)]{.mark} the flow of financial capital (i.e., [who profits from
development]{.mark}). [Currently]{.mark}, out of all stakeholders in the
US Arctic, [corporations]{.mark} [are]{.mark} arguably the [most
powerful]{.mark} [because]{.mark} they have the most [financial
capital]{.mark}. Under the US's free market system, in order for anyone
to benefit financially from development, corporations must be willing to
invest their capital in production activities. From there, [other
stakeholders such as native corporations]{.mark} and municipal, state,
and federal governments [can]{.mark} extract revenue from the activities
of the corporations and [derive]{.mark} a [share of the generated
profit]{.mark}.]{.underline} Mechanisms for extracting revenue from
corporations include taxing their activities on owned land, auctioning
off rights to develop certain tracts of federal territory, and selling
the rights to develop owned oil, gas, and minerals. Despite such
mechanisms, [the [capital]{.mark} possessed by corporations
[give]{.mark} them [significant leverage in governance]{.mark}. Also,
corporations stand to secure the largest profits from the expansion of
development.]{.underline}

[The [next question]{.mark} is whether the [corporations]{.mark}, who
are profiting the most, are also [incurring]{.mark} the [biggest
risk]{.mark}. [If]{.mark} such an assessment is calculated strictly [in
terms of dollars]{.mark}, the answer might be [yes]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Corporations invest hundreds of millions of dollars into various phases
on industrial activity on well calculated gambles that may or may not
pay off. However, [when risks are calculated [in other ways]{.mark}, it
would appear that [communities]{.mark} actually [have]{.mark} the [most
to lose]{.mark} from increased industrial development. [If]{.mark}
either a major [industrial accident]{.mark} or the [crossing]{.mark} of
an [ecological tipping point]{.mark} caused by cumulative impacts
occurs, the [subsistence life-ways of Alaska Natives]{.mark} and other
rural residents could be direly [compromised]{.mark}. It is the stance
of this paper that cultural sovereignty should be considered more
valuable than the profits of transnational corporations.]{.underline}

However, [the political-economic situation is complex because the
**[economies of local]{.mark} and state [governments]{.mark}** are
[**highly dependent** on continued revenue]{.mark} streams [from
**natural resource extraction**, and are]{.mark} therefore also [at risk
from decreases in production]{.mark}.]{.underline} In late 2015, the
economic vulnerability of local stakeholders to industrial withdrawal is
playing out in the region, after Shell decided to abandon their efforts
to establish production wells in the Chukchi Sea OCS. [The 'domino
effect' from Shell's pullout includes federal agencies canceling
offshore lease sales, decreased discussion about the need for a US
Arctic deep-draft port, and a general anxiety among those who derive
economic benefit from the fossil fuel industry in Alaska.]{.underline}

[[Good governance]{.mark} would [include]{.mark} [rules]{.mark} [that
pulled]{.mark} more of the [control]{.mark} [and financial
benefit]{.mark} associated with industrial infrastructure [away
from]{.mark} the [corporations]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [put it in]{.mark}
the [hands of communities]{.mark}. This could [include]{.mark} a [major
restructuring of the benefit agreements]{.mark} between corporations and
native interests, whereby the amount of profit extracted by the native
interests increased substantially (perhaps in step with the amount of
new infrastructure). Institutional adaptations could also include
[native organizations]{.mark} [becom]{.mark}ing the [main actors in
decision making about future development]{.mark}, rather than the
current situation that sees industry calling the shots and non-native
governments being the main regulators (but with minor Indigenous
participation). Institutional adaptations such as these could
[limit]{.mark} the [economic vulnerability]{.mark} [of local
actors]{.mark} [allowing them to regulate]{.mark} the [degree]{.mark} to
which [they]{.mark} become [depend]{.mark}ent [on volatile]{.mark}
industrial [industries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[As a nation, the [US]{.mark} could [develop]{.mark} a [new
understanding of]{.mark} what the [role of corporations]{.mark} should
be in society; the US could [implement]{.mark} a [standard of corporate
social responsibility]{.mark} whereby society broadly (and
directly-impacted communities specifically) were the main beneficiaries
of industrial activity, rather than the owners of the transnational
corporations operating in the region.]{.underline} These are radical
recommendations, but these are also radical times. The Arctic is
changing at an unprecedented rate and so too must governance.

Land, Capitalism, and Dispossession

Much of the [literature on the political economy of land traces its
genealogy to Karl Marx's analysis of capitalism and the "secret of
primitive accumulation"]{.underline} (1993: 873). [The "original sin" of
capitalism, what Marx calls "primitive accumulation" and what we refer
to hereafter as "primary accumulation," is the process through which the
worker is divorced of their means of production and is thus alienated
from their own labor.]{.underline}2 [This is achieved through the
transformation of subsistence production into capital and producers into
wage laborers]{.underline} (874). [Before capitalist accumulation can
begin, this primary mode of dispossession---the separation of workers
from their means of subsistence---must take place.]{.underline} Marx
suggests that this is a "historical process" relegated to the
"pre-history of capital" (875). This processual understanding of primary
accumulation is valuable but needs modification for application to
settler colonial contexts. In these contexts, the [dispossession of land
is at the heart of domination. Marx acknowledges the varied means used
to separate workers from the means of production, highlighting how "the
law itself . . . becomes the instrument by which people's land is
stolen"]{.underline} (885). These juridical forms, not relegated to the
past, are still central to the control of land in settler state contexts
today.

[The story of primary accumulation entails not only land being taken
away but also its commodification]{.underline} (Polanyi 1944). Indeed,
[the juridical structures of dispossession (land's commodification and
transformation into property) are fundamental to settler colonial
dispossession. Recent scholarship on global land grabbing links
large-scale transformations of land to transnational processes involving
private capital and state-managed land tenure regimes]{.underline}
(Deininger 2011; Hall 2013; Peluso and Lund 2011). The dispossession of
land is frequently obscured by the absence of a set of clear actors,
instead operating through diffuse structural processes. Often, the focus
is on sites outside the Anglophone settler world and involves processes
affecting smallholders (Fairhead et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2011; Li
2011). [The political valence of these "land grabs" is less suited to
describing settler colonial contexts that operate differently than to
large-scale land investment by multinational private actors and
nation-states.3 Therefore, using the land grab as an analytic
necessitates paying attention to the ontological basis of state and
private-led dispossession as much the political-economic mechanisms of
accumulation itself. For Indigenous peoples, as well as peasants and
other agriculturalists, the loss of land is experienced as more than
just alienation from a means of subsistence production. Enclosure of
common lands and their transformation into private property is a double
negation: the loss of land, and the devastation of the sets of
relationships that constitute land in Indigenous
ontologies.]{.underline} Capitalism is fundamental to the structural
conditions of settler colonialism.

[When a company does well, so should its workers. American workers have
helped the economy grow by becoming more productive. Yet, even as
productivity has increased, many middle- and working-class households
have experienced stagnant wages and declining household incomes over the
past few decades. This means workers currently receive only a small
share of the wealth they help create.]{.underline}

[Broad-based sharing programs]{.underline}---such as granting workers an
ownership stake or a share of profits based on workers' collective
performance---can help [ensure that workers are rewarded for the wealth
they generate.]{.underline} Advocates for these programs refer to this
type of sharing by a number of names, including broad-based profit
sharing and inclusive capitalism. Collectively, [these programs hold the
potential not only to benefit workers: Research shows that firms and
investors also receive tangible benefits from sharing with their
workers.]{.underline}

[Yet, too often, **companies embrace a strategy that includes paying
their workers the lowest possible wages**; providing few benefits; and
creating a work environment where turnover is high, worker knowledge is
low, and profits are maximized by driving down labor costs.]{.underline}

As a result, [workers are not reaping the full benefits of their
increasing productivity or the country's economic growth.]{.underline} A
typical worker today is almost 60 percent more productive than a worker
was 25 years ago but has seen only half of that productivity growth
translate into higher compensation.

Instead, the gains from economic growth in the United States have
increasingly gone only to those at the very top. Among the top 20
percent of families by net worth, average wealth increased by 120
percent between 1983 and 2010, while the middle 20 percent of families
only saw their wealth increase by 13 percent, and the bottom fifth of
families saw their debt exceed their assets. Meanwhile, corporate
profits are capturing a growing share of national income.

A small but growing body of research shows that broad-based sharing
programs can help reverse this trend and ensure that workers' wages and
wealth increase as the economy grows. Studies measuring the benefits of
various types of broad-based sharing programs find that---when compared
to workers in similar companies without sharing programs---workers'
wages are significantly higher, they are four times more likely to have
defined benefit pension plans, and they are more than five times more
likely to have 401(k) plans.

[Yet, far too few workers receive the significant benefits available
from inclusive capitalism, and there are a number of issues that
**inhibit the growth of broad-based profit sharing programs**. Business
owners and executives are often unaware of inclusive capitalism programs
and the mutual benefits they provide. In addition---while not born out
by existing research---owners and executives often believe that company
success is driven by a small number of "key" employees, particularly
executives; this leads them to focus incentive pay on these individuals,
not ordinary employees. Moreover, some government policies provide
perverse incentives not to share; existing policies to encourage
companies to share ownership with their employees are inadequate; and
the federal government does not have a unified vision for how to
encourage more sharing.]{.underline}

While the federal government has adopted a number of policies to support
[broad-based sharing programs]{.underline}---such as tax advantages for
companies and owners interested in selling to their employees---it can
do more to ensure that more workers are able participate in these
programs.

First, the government should eliminate perverse incentives that
encourage companies not to share with their employees. Reforming the tax
code so that it no longer subsidizes narrow incentive programs that
benefit only top executives would be a big start. In addition,
policymakers should ensure that employee-owned companies are not barred
from participating in contract set-aside programs.

Second, [government leaders should adopt policies to incent more
companies to implement broad-based sharing plans. It can do so by making
it easier for companies that share with their workers to benefit from
existing loan guarantees through the Small Business
Administration.]{.underline} This would ensure that these businesses
have access to the capital they need to sell to their employees---a good
investment as these companies have lower rates of default than
comparable companies without sharing programs. Policymakers should also
encourage estates to sell to workers by providing partial estate tax
relief.

[Third, the federal government can begin to bridge knowledge gaps and
thereby encourage more companies to adopt broad-based sharing programs
for workers by creating an Office of Inclusive Capitalism. This office
would promote outreach and provide technical assistance to private
sector businesses, unions, and workers and improve government knowledge
and support for **inclusive capitalism.**]{.underline}

[These policies represent]{.underline} the Center for American Progress'
plan for how to encourage greater adoption of **[inclusive capitalism
programs throughout the economy]{.underline}**. Some are new concepts,
while other concepts build on policies included in the recent report of
the Commission on Inclusive Prosperity, as well as the good work of
others. Academics, practitioners, and a bipartisan group of
lawmakers---including Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI), Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-PA),
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA), Rep. Brett
Guthrie (R-KY), Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL), Rep. Ann McLane Kuster
(D-NH), Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), Sen. Bernie
Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and Sen. Amy Klobuchar
(D-MN)---are increasingly discussing how government policy can be used
to encourage more companies to adopt employee ownership programs and
other types of profit sharing. For example, the bipartisan Promotion and
Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2015 would further
support worker ownership in privately owned companies.

Indigenous Ontology: Hybridity and Revitalizing Relationships with Land

A case study of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of
the Flathead Indian Reservation, located in the northwestern United
States, can illustrate how hybrid ontologies of land offer ways to
consolidate a tribal land base in the service of revitalizing
relationships with the other-than-human world. [Much of the CSKT's work
is oriented toward reversing the dispossession of Indigenous lands by
Euro-American settlers who claimed title to newly created homesteads in
the early twentieth century]{.underline} (Bigart and Woodcock 1996).
This was made possible by the transformation of land into property,
which took place through US government--led land surveys and subsequent
allotment (Latta 1989). Despite the territorial-bounded reservation of
land stipulated in the 1855 Treaty of Hellgate, more than half of the
unceded land within the territory of the Confederated Salish & Kootenai
Nation was sold as property to white settlers (Smith 1979). It was not
until 1934 that the US federal allotment policy ended, but that did
nothing to reverse the prior loss of land. Only in the wake of the civil
rights and Red Power movements did governance policies begin to change
in the 1970s (Ruppel 2008). This marked the beginning of the era of
revitalization. [Today, the officials at the CSKT Tribal Lands
Department have a clear sense of their objective: to return land to
tribal control, but not strictly as a form of property.]{.underline}
This land base also provides for the expansion of land-based practices
such as caring for culturally important relations with the nonhuman
world, the protection of landscapes imbued with collective memories, and
the provision of material benefits to the Native community, such as
housing.

The CSKT Tribal Lands Department was established in 1982. It emerged
from the Tribal Realty Office that was created in the 1960s, with Bureau
of Indian Affairs realty staff tasked with overseeing the titling and
transfer of common and individual trust lands on the reservation. The
new Tribal Lands Department grew to take on additional activities,
including permitting surveys, land use planning, and, most importantly,
land acquisition. The 2000s saw the increasing size and role of tribal
governance in land acquisition. This came with the emergence of new
technologies, like geographic information systems (GIS), as tools to
track, manage, and prioritize its landholdings starting in the 1990s.8
Lands were purchased at the market rate and then put through a process
to have the land transferred to trust status, meaning it became tribal
land again (though still as property). Still, [the consolidation of
tribal landholdings facilitates the creation of spaces for practices
that recognize and instantiate relationships among the human and
other-than-human.]{.underline}

[The emergence of the Tribal Lands Department marks a shift in which
bureaucratic institutions of land management, many of them prescribed by
federal rules, came to dominate how land was used and therefore
perceived. As discussed earlier, these bureaucratized modes of managing
land carry their own subjectivities, which embed their own ontologies of
land. [Settler state institutions of private property cannot be entirely
circumvented given the extant relationship between tribal nations and
the US government, but relationships can be revitalized even within
these institutions.]{.mark} In this context, it is also hard to imagine
revitalization without attention to alternate modalities like the
relationality described by many scholars]{.underline} (Blaser 2016;
Carroll 2015; Coulthard 2014; TallBear 2017; Todd 2015). [[If land is
constituted in the ways it is governed, then it is also tied up with
different practices, from]{.mark} the spatial subjectivities of GIS to
[manage land and target its reacquisition, to the subjectivities of land
as constituted in the reciprocal obligations of tribal land use
practices.]{.mark} These different subjectivities are oriented toward
different affordances of land. Spatial technologies are amenable to
registering the value of "resources" such as timber but not to the more
phenomenological idea of an experience relating to other-than-human
persons---or stories that represent and reproduce collective memories
constitutive of Indigenous belonging to place.]{.underline}

[[Land and]{.mark} the [environment are always bound up in the
historical discursive apparatuses of the state---not just settler
states, but also Indigenous states---at the same time as Indigenous
peoples are successfully contesting these logics and
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}, a central point made by Carroll (2015).
[But [working to reacquire land solely on]{.mark} the register of
[settler state regimes of land ownership and capitalist relations is
limiting]{.mark}, so [land-based practices are essential to reworking
the]{.mark} very [notion of land underpinning settler colonial
domination.]{.mark} [Settler modes of thinking about the land are being
appropriated to take the land back while other modes of thinking are
being practiced.]{.mark} This story is not limited to bureaucratic
processes of land acquisition and management: it also involves
land-based practices that focus on reciprocal obligations and the
other-than-human to revitalize alternate ontologies. Land-based
practices, in many cases, occur outside the purview of tribal government
departments. But they are connected, as funding to support cultural
activities frequently comes from the tribal government, although
cultural leadership largely emanates from a council of elders. This
highlights a tension that exists in Indigenous governance in which
formal state institutions contend with practices that are underwritten
by very different ontological categories. Sometimes this emerges as
conflict over the disposition of land. The work of [decolonization
operates at]{.mark} this [nexus where different modalities of land
coexist, often]{.mark} uneasily or [in conflict with each other.]{.mark}
Therefore, [decolonization cannot simply be]{.mark} the [rejection of
one modality of land for the other, but rather follows an uneasy path to
maintain a hybrid assemblage of ontologies]{.mark}, with all their
attendant affordances and limitations.]{.underline}

[Indigenous ontologies are **multiple, place-specific, fluid,
irreducible, and complex**]{.underline} (Whyte 2018; McGregor 2018).
**[They cannot be reduced to a technical]{.underline}** or artefactual
**[additions to dominant approaches, nor can they be employed as an
additional perspective that resolves the limitations of]{.underline}**
Anglo- Eurocentric and [**colonially shaped geographies**. If ontologies
are merely considered as forms of]{.underline}
'[difference]{.underline}' [they are easy to dismiss, assimilate or
reduce to]{.underline} their own **[mythic unities]{.underline}** (Reid
& Sieber 2020). [Seeking to extract elements from Indigenous
ontologies]{.underline}, for example, [to rethink]{.underline} the
[culture-nature dualism, without attending to the deep political
implications of Indigeneity, **reduces and confines its possibilities
and power**]{.underline}. This [selective engagement is]{.underline}
also [a form of **appropriation** and **colonisation of Indigenous
knowledge**]{.underline}. It is vital, therefore, that geographers
engage with Indigenous ontologies in conceptual, political, and
practical ways.

This [engagement with Indigenous ontologies should be]{.underline}
further [complicated by acknowledging]{.underline} that [many
people]{.underline} already [navigate **multiple
ontologies**]{.underline} (**[it is not a dualistic framework of
Indigenous versus Anglo-Eurocentric ontologies]{.underline}**). This
does not mean, however, that it is necessarily possible nor indeed
desirable to seek to translate or equate between different ontologies.
de la Cadena (2010) argues that plural worlds are not commensurable --
[we must live with the acknowledgement of pluriversality and **resist**
the desire to]{.underline} '[resolve]{.underline}' [differences between
ontologies into a singular way of understanding the world]{.underline}.
In other words, [engaging with Indigenous ontologies is not about fully
translating, knowing, and understanding everything]{.underline} about
these ontologies; [rather, the political point is]{.underline} for
geographers [to acknowledge that **we live in a world of plural
ontologies**, the tensions between and navigation of which offer us
insight into the possibility of living differently, better understanding
what it means to be human, and multispecies justice]{.underline} (Hunt
2014; Pellow 2016). [Central to this is a need to **work with the
unknowable**]{.underline} (that outsiders can never fully know
Indigenous ontologies) [while advocating for political changes that
**support the right of Indigenous ontologies to persist and have
material presence** in the world. This advocacy may involve]{.underline}
forms of '[co-becoming]{.underline}' (Bawaka Country et al. 2016),
[self-determination, or **asserting**]{.underline} land or [**resource
ownership privileges**. This clashes with]{.underline} some
anthropological [approaches which seek to verify the detail and veracity
of Indigenous ontologies]{.underline} in order [to construct a universal
understanding of humanity]{.underline} (see Viveiros de Castro's 1998
discussion of the concept of Amerindian perspectivism).

As geographers have long explored how knowing about the world is
embodied and materialised in ways of being, and consequently expressed
through practices, we are ideally positioned to work with Indigenous
ontologies productively. As Blaser (2014) argues, [ontologies are a way
of worlding, but it is only in how they become enacted, practised, and
performed that they become political]{.underline} (see also Clément's
2017 examination of embodied Māori ontologies). It is in this enactment
that geographers can (and already are) politically advocating for change
in the academy and the world. It is in this political enactment,
therefore, that Indigenous ontologies are unsettling the academic
discipline of geography.

Using the praxis of 'unsettling' disciplinary thought (building on
Meehan et al. 2023), this paper examines how relational geographies are
unsettled by Indigenous ontologies, particularly in acknowledging the
agency of place, that everything cannot become knowable, and the
inseparability of epistemologies from ontologies. Relationality works
best when it is generated through what Barker and I have conceptualised
as 'doings together in place' (Barker & Pickerill 2020) -- engaged,
careful, empirical research through practices and lived experiences that
unsettle assumptions about what it is possible to know, and instead
builds relations through 'doings'. Doing geography differently generates
transformative practices that challenge the coloniality of our
university institutions, advocate for and support hopeful alternatives,
work for self-determination and promote multispecies justice. [Central
to this]{.underline} [process is engaging in the **specifics** of place,
practices and lived experiences, and how as researchers we must get
embroiled in the complex]{.underline} '[doings]{.underline}' [of
Indigenous ontologies]{.underline}. I conclude by reflecting on the
possibilities this unsettling enables, while being cautious of the risks
of engaging with Indigenous ontologies in ongoing colonial, extractive,
and violent ways.

#### Trying to create a singular ontology [reproduces]{.underline} Western power relations, and valorizing 'Indigenous knowledge' denies its specificity.

DG

Second, [Indigenous ontologies unsettle the idea]{.underline} that
[everything can become knowable. There is a **danger in seeking to
abstract specific knowledges into universalised
understandings**]{.underline} (of concepts like place) of **[overwriting
the specificity of Indigenous ontologies]{.underline}**. As Bawaka
Country et al. (2016) argue, there are limits to human perceptions such
that we cannot perceive or necessarily understand all the co-becomings
that are occurring, but we must trust that they are there because we may
be impacted by them in some way. [Accepting]{.underline} this
[unknowability respects the **fluidity of Indigenous knowledge**. Such
knowledge is **not a fixed entity** which can be consumed and turned
into a product for academic knowledge production; it is a **living,
connecting reference point** and]{.underline} '[the future of Indigenous
rights and political struggles **depend** on the ability of Indigenous
knowledge to retain its active, mobile, relational nature **rather than
the fixity**]{.underline} it is given in colonial law, **[stuck at the
point of contact with colonizers]{.underline}**' (Hunt 2014: 30).

As Viveiros de Castro (1998) and de la Cadena (2010) advocate,
[respecting the]{.underline} place-based [**specificities** of
Indigenous ontologies, and not seeking to equate between]{.underline}
the [ideas, symbols, or objects in these knowledges]{.underline} with
those in Anglo-Eurocentric geographies [is **crucial politically**.
There can be **no certainty, verifiability, or necessarily clarity of
knowledge for Anglo-Eurocentric scholars**]{.underline} of Indigenous
ontologies, [and **seeking simple translations can confuse** rather than
aid **understanding**]{.underline}. Similarly, [Indigenous ontologies
cannot easily be appropriated or aligned for political
gain]{.underline}. de la Cadena (2010) demonstrates this in examining
the differences between environmental arguments against a mine with
Indigenous activists' claims. [While sometimes]{.underline} these
[political groups might align]{.underline} (even with different
rationales), [they can just as easily end up in opposition because
of]{.underline} the [different relationalities]{.underline} of
Indigenous ontologies. [The danger here]{.underline}, then, [is in
**reducing Indigenous ontologies to a politically useful position,
rather than engaging with their ongoing, emerging, and dynamic
complexity**]{.underline}. Likewise, the full extent of this complexity
cannot be known by Anglo-Eurocentric geographers, and instead must be
trusted as an unknown.

Accepting unknowability leads to two further unsettling realisations:
the consequences of plural ontologies and pluriversality, and that
relationalities can have purposeful boundaries. [The notion
that]{.underline} we live in plural worlds -- that [there are plural
ontologies and many people already navigate multiple
ontologies]{.underline} -- [is increasingly accepted]{.underline} by
human geographers (Larsen and Johnson 2012a, 2012b, 2016) and as Noxolo
argues '[decolonialisation is a process of building towards the
**pluriversality of knowledge**]{.underline}' (Noxolo 2017: 318). This
multiplicity makes sense of geographical assemblages and ethnographic
identification of 'others' (Blaser 2014). However, this recognition
troubles attempts at identifying commonalities that might be necessary
in seeking politically progressive action and in determining political
agency (Ioris 2020). Pluriversality and unknowability complicate
attempts to build common political agencies at scale. At the same time,
while in theory 'everything is always in relationship with everything
else' (Kanngiser et al. 2024: 1), and therefore there are ongoing
processes of transformation and mutation through these relations, in
practice politically different ontologies will be articulated as
separate to assert political goals, such as political representation or
land back (Bawaka Country et al. 2016). There are two processes at play
here: that relational thinking is articulated as bounded and bordered
for political gain, but also that the lived experiences of Indigenous
ontologies are of one that is placed, material, limited and in
juxtaposition to, often Anglo-Eurocentric ontologies of settler
colonialism. As Cochrane and Arredondo (2005) argue, 'relational
thinking implies openness that often belies the lived-experience of
many' (cited in Bawaka Country et al. 2016: 460). [There are political
advantages to articulating boundedness and this distinctiveness can
reflect a lived experience of contestations between
ontologies]{.underline}.

Finally, **[Indigenous ontologies cannot be considered separately from
epistemologies]{.underline}** -- ontologies are best understood through
practice and doings (Wilson 2020). [Indigenous ways of knowing are
expressed and articulated as ways of being and doing]{.underline}, 'we
become tangible proof of our ontology ... we are able to show (Do),
respectfully and rightfully (Being) what we know (Knowing)' (Martin &
Mirraboopa 2003: 210). [Indigenous knowledges]{.underline} centralise
relationality in epistemological processes, and through embodied,
phenomenological, and affective approaches to knowledge production. This
**[shapes how research is conducted just as much as it shapes what
research is seeking to understand]{.underline}**.

[Relationalities]{.underline}, therefore, [are central to working with
Indigenous ontologies, but also unsettle Anglo Eurocentric
methodological and ethical demands]{.underline}. Indigenous scholars
require autonomy to develop and work with, and through, Indigenous
epistemologies with accountability to Indigenous communities and
protocols first and foremost. [Indigenous research]{.underline}
obviously [requires]{.underline} collaboration and [interaction with
participants in non- extractive ways that are **always in
process**]{.underline} -- in relation -- **[and need to remain
open-ended and sustained over time]{.underline}**. Crucially, these
[relational engagements]{.underline} also [enable the **refusal** and
**rejection of involvement in academic research**. This refusal of
co-becoming is a vital aspect of resurgent Indigenous nationhood
which]{.underline} means **[sometimes it is better not to do the
research at all]{.underline}**.

[Indigenous ontologies]{.underline}, therefore, [unsettle Anglo
Eurocentric approaches to relationalities by **focusing on the agency of
place**, challenging the notion that everything can become knowable, by
demonstrating that relationalities can have purposeful political and
lived boundaries, and in the inseparability of epistemologies from
ontologies]{.underline}. The [relationalities]{.underline} (and
non-relationalities) [of Indigenous ontologies **disrupt attempts at
universalism** and the appropriation of Indigenous knowledges for
colonial gain]{.underline}. Furthermore, [there is a need to value and
respect the **distinctiveness** of]{.underline} Indigenous [place-based
ontologies given]{.underline} how [they are explicitly tied into
political calls for the return of Indigenous lands]{.underline}. It is
also vital to acknowledge that [land rights here are **about much more
than questions of ownership, but underpin language, culture, and
self-determination**]{.underline}.

On the contrary, [decolonization is]{.underline} understood as
"[reclaiming and restoring]{.underline}" a [pre-colonial means of doing,
being and acting]{.underline}, or "taking away the colonial" (Brant
2023). [Decolonization is **not the simple recognition of
wrongs**]{.underline} done through colonialism, [but]{.underline} the
**[actual and intentional actions]{.underline}** and choices [made to
allow and create means by which Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and
doing are restored]{.underline} (Indigenous Corporate Training 2017).
Linda Tuhiwai Smith, a Māori researcher and scholar, argues that the
process of [decolonization is not a quick process, but requires the
enduring progressions of]{.underline} "the [bureaucratic, cultural,

and imperialistic practices and teachings, while encouraging the
**revitalization of Indigenous knowledges**]{.underline} (Smith 2012).
Eve Tuck, a Unangax scholar, writer and poet, and K. Wayne Yang, a
settler scholar, state that **[decolonization as a

is employed properly and respectfully]{.underline}, "[is not an 'and.'
**It is an elsewhere**]{.underline}" (Tuck and Yang 2012, 36). This
further implies that true [decolonization **affirms** full **Indigenous

Yang 2012).

### AT: Land Acknowledgement\-\--2AC

#### Land acknowledgements are [empty gestures]{.underline} that actively trade off with [material decolonization]{.underline}.

Enter "[decolonization]{.underline}", **[a buzzword like those before
it]{.underline}**: "inclusivity", "diversity", "reconciliation" (or was
that after? It's hard to keep track). Post-secondary [institutions
jumped at the opportunity to declare their commitments to
decolonization]{.underline}, but Indigenous scholars and communities
affirm that institutions continue to replicate acts of research harm on
studied communities, while perpetuating unsafe classrooms and work
environments for Indigenous peoples. [Land acknowledgements, intended to
unsettle settler presence and benefit from stolen Lands, **have become
customary** throughout institutions]{.underline} over the last decade,
[**yet, the recognition of ongoing theft without meaningful action or
change has been** critiqued as **performative**]{.underline} (Lambert,
Sobo, and Lambert 2021; Robinson et al. 2019).

Decolonizing and Indigenizing within a Colonial Academic Institution

In both teaching and research, [the upheaval of decolonization **does
not require**]{.underline} mere **[recognition of Indigenous Lands but
aims to center Indigenous ontologies, epistemologies, axiologies and
pedagogies]{.underline}** -- rooted in ancestral and historical
knowledge, teachings, and laws. Smith (2012, 41) writes,
"[decolonization]{.underline}, however, **[does not]{.underline}** mean
**[and has not meant a total rejection of all theory or research or
Western knowledge]{.underline}**. Rather, [it is about centering our
concerns and world views and]{.underline} then [coming to know and
understand theory and research]{.underline} from our own perspectives
and for our own purposes." For indigenization to occur, it is necessary
for relationships to be established, and for Indigenous peoples to
instruct this process. Here we see decolonization and indigenization
used interchangeably, as calls to critique the existing privileging of
western knowledge systems, while making space for Indigenous ways of
being and knowing, "embedding Indigenous practices, ideas, and
principles into our academic pursuits" (Pete 2016, 81). [To attempt
either decolonization or indigenization is inherently
political]{.underline}, and to the western eye, such institutional
renovation can be perceived as overly biased or subjective. We know.
That's the point.

Elsewhere, I've critiqued the role that "well-intentioned professors,
administrators, and even self-ordained scholar-activists have in
'[metaphorizing]{.underline}' [decolonization in lieu of engaging in
**practical** and **pragmatic efforts** that concretely promote
Indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and
self-determination]{.underline}" (Gahman and Legault 2019, 2). Such
efforts, **[like the performative]{.underline}**- only [**Land
acknowledgement, defeat the intent and purpose of decolonization**,
which is to not only recognize the existence of Indigenous peoples,
Lands, and knowledges but also affirm and promote their validity and
rights]{.underline}. Within academia, it is important that we are
intentional in the ways that we confront colonial entities while staying
true to our ontologies and epistemologies. Through engaging in the
Kelowna Urban Indigenous Youth Project together as Principal
Investigator (PI) and Research Assistant (RA), we sought to be mindful
of the ways in which we were engaging in decolonization and/or
indigenization.

But there are [problems with]{.underline} these
[acknowledgements]{.underline}. First, as I noted above, they don't deal
with successive occupation of the land:

> . . . the [statement from University of Texas names no fewer than ten
> tribes before concluding]{.underline} the sentence [with]{.underline}
> an embarrassed "[etcetera]{.underline}," which acknowledges "all the
> \[other\] American Indian and Indigenous Peoples and communities who

> needs to be]{.underline}** "**[acknowledged]{.underline}**" for the
> land: much of the [**info**rmation is lost to history]{.underline}.

And, more important, Ellwanger emphasizes that [many Native Americans
did not share our]{.underline} capitalistic [preoccupation
with]{.underline} "[owning]{.underline}" [land]{.underline}. He gives
several examples; here's one:

> Massasoit Sachem (leader of the Wampanoag confederacy) is reputed to

> for the land is our mother, nourishing all her children, beasts,
> birds, fish and all men. The woods, the streams, everything on it
> belongs to everybody and is for the use of all."

And he adds this:

> Thus, [by]{.underline} "[acknowledging]{.underline}" [the native
> claims to a piece of land and implying]{.underline} that
> [these]{.underline} claims [supersede and negate the
> claim]{.underline} that [modern]{.underline} local and federal

This all makes sense, but of course even if Native Americans didn't have
our concept of "property", they were still displaced from their lands by
settlers. To me that seems just as bad, especially when they were
forcibly driven to desolate reservations. I don't know the solution to
this, except to say that [Native Americans continually displaced each
other by the **same methods**]{.underline} (war, broken treaties, and so
on), and we are just part of that history.

To me, [land acknowledgments are the **height of performative
wokeness**: statements that **accomplish absolutely nothing** save to
call attention to your heightened consciousness]{.underline}---and
perhaps impart a history lesson, but why is that part of a talk or a
syllabus? [If you're on stolen land, then **give it back instead of
moaning about it**. It's as if one began a class by saying "I'm using a
laser pointer I stole from Professor Jones, but I'm not going to give it
back to him."]{.underline}

#### It's a reverse voting issue.

College of Public Affairs at the University of Baltimore, Ph.D. in
Political Science from the University of Colorado Boulder, "What's wrong
with Native American land acknowledgements at university commencement
and graduation exercises?", Jeffrey Ian Ross, 12-12-2022,
https://jeffreyianross.com/whats-wrong-with-native-american-land-acknowledgements-at-university-commencement-and-graduation-exercises

Although I'm not the only person to have difficulty with public native
land acknowledgements, I think that the college/university context or
platform deserves greater scrutiny.

First, [Native American land claims acknowledgements are part of a
continuum that includes the commodification, co-optation,
fetishization]{.underline}, etc.[of important social
relationships]{.underline}.

Second, I would argue that [the audience in attendance **don't** really
**care**]{.underline}. If it's the graduating students, then [their
major goal]{.underline} is to get their degree, pose for pictures with
their fellow students, family, and maybe a faculty member or two if they
are in attendance. If it's the parents or loved ones of the graduating
students, then it is to celebrate the day. And [if it's the staff,
faculty and administrators it's to **get the hell out of there** as
quick as possible]{.underline}.

Third, [public Native American land claims acknowledgements
**disingenuous** and **disrespectful**]{.underline}. Why? If we are
talking about universities, then rarely does this mean that the
institution of higher education has a native American studies program,
or department, [It does not mean]{.underline} that they will be hiring
more American Indian faculty, or [making a concentrated
effort]{.underline} to recruit American Indian students more.

Fourth, one must conclude that [issuing land acknowledgements
is]{.underline} mostly [**performative**. It's a way to show to those in
attendance]{.underline}, and perhaps a larger audience [that the
university]{.underline} cares or **[can check the box]{.underline}**.

Fifth, [the issuance of land claims acknowledgement is **hypocritical**.
If]{.underline}, for example, [the university]{.underline} where the
land claims acknowledgement is being made [dates back to
pre-emancipation times, one can]{.underline} almost entirely
[assume]{.underline} that [parts]{.underline} of the university [were
built with slave labor]{.underline}. But as one can predict [this is
**rarely acknowledged**]{.underline} in these public spectacles.

Sixth, [public land claims statements like this is **faux activism** and
**virtue signaling**]{.underline}. Their ability to change things is
really limited.

In short, just like many public displays, Native American [land claim
acknowledgements **don't really do anything to help** native peoples
**or repair the wrongs that have been done**]{.underline}.
